When we talk about ""Connections"", we're actually often talking about information flow.<p>Capital-C Connections are about the ability to advertise oneself to a set of parasitic people with disproportionate power. As the world wakes up to this emperor having no clothes, this is becoming less important. Look at Mitt Romney's amazement at the fact people who scoff about the ""47%"" in private (in a world with smart phones and the Internet) can't get elected.<p>That's a push-driven information flow that exists in a time of scarcity. One has to advertise oneself to the few people who are in power. That has been the dominant world for centuries.<p>However, as we move into an era where talent, skill, and know-how are the scarce resources, the more important information flow is pull-driven. The game for an ambitious person is more about finding things out-- what's worth learning, what to work on. So you win by pulling down the best information, not by pushing (low-quality, biased) information about oneself into the streams of others.",1359377651

5128267,comment,5126443,5127559,4,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I don't think there is much point in trying to phrase it in terms of what X has that Y doesn't, such comparisons are fraught will peril and are more indicative of a person's past decisions on what language to take. Better to talk about trade offs. Each language has a trade off that is not a big deal in terms of language capabilities. For Ocaml it is multithreading, for Scala lack of TCO+limited inference, for Haskell it's packages and for F# it's compatibility with .NET.<p>Those features [type classes,structural (sub)typing] you mention as being a problem simply aren't  really missed due to other things on offer. While F# does not have type classes (non erasure has it's advantages to ease that lack) you don't really notice it as it turns out that kind of power is pivotal in a handful of cases and for that F# has these statically resolved type parameters which do a kind of static duck typing that is good enoughTM. The static overloading is not hit and the static methods are useful the way F# implements them (makes things simple, not as annoying or cumbersome as in C#).<p>Most of the time computation expressions and or simple abstract classes or interfaces with object expressions , occasionally coupled with active patterns are more than good enough for the kind of places type classes might otherwise be used. Personally, I try to make simple choices so that algebraic datatypes and records are all that is needed. I'm allergic to fancy code. I mentioned active patterns, they are really quite powerful - at the same level of power as multimethods (I have used them to solve an expression problem type thing). I believe that the use of Active Patterns and Quotations in F# is more common than in Scala due to choices in where power focus lie. I also find F#<->C# interop to be a bit easier than Scala<->Java interop for the same reason that C# -> F#  objects are basically injective while Java -> Scala is only a subset.<p>I also think F# is more functional than Scala.  Scala is supposed to be something different: a successful melding of OOP and functional. And it is the best at that I have seen. It succeeds on this better than the next biggest contender: F#. F# is more typically functional, using the usual Hindley Milner Inference and sharing a core with OCaml but with significant whitespace. So it can be very succinct. Typically functional idioms like algebraic data types, Piping, point free, currying and combinators is more natural to F# than Scala's more OOP way.<p>There are a number of things that Scala does naturally that are cumbersome in other languages because of how it manages to meld a powerful combination of orthogonal features. To use Scala as just another functional language is to miss its power. Those who criticize OOP have not used a language that does it right. Abstractly, in a simplified categoric setting, we can consider Abstract types (objects as an aproximation as coalgebras) and FP (algebraic data types) as duals of each other. A proper unification of the concepts gives something more flexible than either. I think Scala comes the closest. Sure you can be 100% functional in it, or replicate Java but to call it one or the other is to make the same mistake as to say that light is both a wave and a particle and think you understand what that means.",1359377293

5128251,comment,5127538,5127538,7,0,maeon3,,,"Your brain is a neural network of neural networks, during sleep, a cost function is applied across the entire grid.  Important aspects of your day are done, and redone at high velocity, simultaneously (leading to dreams).<p>Cost benefit analysis are done against what you might have done, and the results of that, and actions that would have caused more desirable outcomes are projected, as best as it can see, and the habits, and motor neurons are reconfigured accordingly, this explains why when you get good sleep, and you wake up, you find yourself much better able to do tasks than had you not slept.  If you don't sleep, you die.<p>Source of these points:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed/dp/0670025291"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed/dp/06...</a><p><a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/ml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/ml</a><p>Title is misleading, this function also has to do with encoding short term memories to long term memories.  Since the mind only has limited space (limited number of neurons to configure), that only the most useful memories are stored into permanent disk.  Disruption of the 7 to 9 hour sleep cycle garbage collects the memories that were about to be stored.  The mind queues them up to be dealt with the following day, but sometimes are displaced or missed by more passionate things in the present.<p>Sleep is one of the most important things you can do to maintain your mind and keep it in top running condition for as long as possible, not too little, not too much, sleep in intervals of 90 minutes.  If you consume garbage knowledge on a daily basis, your mind will encode that garbage to permanent disk, and you will become that garbage.<p>Conspiracy theorists suffer from a mental misconfiguration where the cost function applied to the neural network of neural networks suffers from ""over fitting"".  Finding patterns in randomness leading to conclusions are not valid.  A lambda function can be applied against the cost function which will alleviate this.  I can do it in software, and when I discover the operating principles of the neo cortex, I will be able to fix all the conspiracy nuts in the local nut house.  Take care to not take for granted the fresh slate of your mind while you are young, because when you are old, it'll be mostly full and encoding new skills to disk much more difficult, the cost function is more reluctant to modify the grids since doing so would damage your ability to consume resources, find mates and create more of you.  Fill you mind with timeless wisdom and get good sleep before your hard disks become full.",1359376992

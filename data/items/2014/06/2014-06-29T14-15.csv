7961326,comment,7960629,7960629,2,0,ixwt,,,"One game I am looking forward to the Linux port is Transistor by Super Giant Games. They said when it first comes out, it will be available on PS4 and PC. And they will be working on a Linux and Mac port soon afterwards[0].<p>As for the trend, I have normally seen the Linux port as a stretch goal for Kickstarters. While it&#x27;s a shame it isn&#x27;t a priority from the start, I feel that this is another sign of the increasing trend. Developers are considering it an incentive, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing.<p>Another thing I think the author left out is Steam In-home Streaming [1]. It allows you to play any game that can be played through Steam, on a non-windows computer that has Steam on the same LAN. (I think even those that aren&#x27;t on Steam, if you add it to steam as a non-steam game. I haven&#x27;t tested this though) While not the most optimal setup (a powerful windows machine dedicated to streaming one game at a time, with a dumb terminal or another computer without windows), I feel it is designed with the SteamOS in mind to increase the amount of games that can be played. Those that already have a powerful gaming computer can hook up a Steam Box to their living room TV and play any game they have access to (and through Steams ability to share libraries, some you haven&#x27;t purchased by your family (or friends) have purchased).<p>I&#x27;ve tested the Steam In-Home streaming myself. I was using a very under-powered laptop at the time. If that were the case, I&#x27;m sure the latency over LAN would be negligible. Which I believe is the fatal flaw that OnLive had.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://supergiantgames.com/index.php/2013/06/transistor-coming-to-ps4-and-steam/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://supergiantgames.com/index.php/2013/06/transistor-comi...</a>\n[1]: <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/streaming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://store.steampowered.com/streaming/</a>",1404053824

We just launched an adaption{1} of the popular Yo App and we are getting lots of downloads. But now, he is freaking out about getting sued for using a similar name and layout as the Yo app.\nMostly he is worried about having Yo in the app title, which I don’t see any problem with. However, now he changed the app title in our play store account a second time without telling me so in response, I blocked his access.<p>His main argument for not using Yo in our name, is that we shouldn’t be gaining traction from what others have built. However, I think tries to make up arguments why we should change the name. Also, in my opinion our app is significantly different to Yo and he is simply getting worked up about us getting sued for copyright infringement or intellectual property theft.<p>Moreover, having yo in the name is crucial for our app to gain traction as it communicates to people that they can do “one-word” communication to their friends similar to Yo, just in a bit of a different way.<p>I think my question is, is there any way we could get sued realistically? The thing is that we’re in German jurisdiction, so there is not much anyone can sue us about outside of Germany and if it goes through, it would take a year or so, wouldn’t it?<p>{1} https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.messenger.labs",1404053750

One of the big differences between Silicon Valley and elsewhere is that there&#x27;s a much bigger focus on positive-sum activities here. (That&#x27;s in contrast with Wall Street, which has a zero-sum focus, or places like Florida, where it shades negative-sum.) It&#x27;s a useful attitude when you&#x27;re trying to create monster new businesses from scratch, because it&#x27;s much easier to disrupt an industry or create a new one if you&#x27;re creating massive value.<p>Google&#x27;s a great example of that. They have made the world enormously better, and profited greatly thereby. Their profit is a small fraction of the value they&#x27;ve created. And that&#x27;s why they won.

But the biggest issue is probably that it&#x27;s a product of its time, and that was a time long before iOS and Android. RPGMaker executables <i>can</i> be ported to mobile platforms, but the process is wonky, and the total addressable gaming base is very small.<p>And in a lot of ways, the audience was always small, even in RPGMaker&#x27;s prime.

They upgrade their OS somewhat regularly (on the order of years, but still).

7961206,comment,7960779,7961171,2,0,jacobparker,,,"Its reason for existence is historical, but it persists because it is useful.<p>&quot;Normal mode&quot; (the most common mode other than insert mode) uses key bindings that wouldn&#x27;t be possible in insert mode, rather than using the ctrl/alt/etc. keys for binding. For example, hovering over a word and typing ciw (change-in-word) will delete the word and place you in insert mode. There is a nice grammar and logic to the default key bindings (mostly.)<p>(IMO) When you are experienced with Vim you will spend most of your time in normal mode. This has a few benefits. For one, undo in Vim is &quot;transactional&quot; as you enter and leave insert mode (its a little more complicated but nevermind.) Everytime I have to use other editors (like VS with the VSVim extension) it drives me batty when I have to undo/redo one-character-at-a-time or with some time based batching that I don&#x27;t understand. (Plug: the GUndo.vim plugin gives you a usable interface to Vim&#x27;s undo tree. It&#x27;s not super common for me to need this, but when I do it is a godsend. (If you&#x27;ve ever done undo, made some edits, and wish you hadn&#x27;t undone after all, this is for you.)",1404050928

8267176,comment,8264733,8264733,23,0,neya,,,"This reminds me of a similar issue that happened within the Scala community. David Polak, the creator of the Lift framework (which is used in production in many top sites), had originally worked hard to create the framework (along with others) and make it production worthy.<p>Later, he realized that the releases of the framework he had created were happening without his involvement. But, instead of accusing the community, he said something remarkable which only multiplied my original respect for him:<p><pre><code>    I never &quot;left&quot; the Lift community. \n    Yes, I have other project and work in different languages. \n    What I did was cease to be Lift&#x27;s benevolent dictator for life. \n    Lift has grown way beyond one person and the fact that\n     the 2.5-M4 release was done without me is a strength, not a weakness.\n</code></pre>\n[1]<p>Because, that&#x27;s the spirit of open source. When you release something to the public, for public consumption, then you must understand that someone is eventually going to fork it up and assign it a different nomenclature, sometimes even a nomenclature that you may not like. In this case, this particular project had no standardization and a part of the community decided to just standardized it. If you don&#x27;t like this standardization, then simply don&#x27;t use it. Use what resonates with you. If you feel the standardization has some flaws, then fork it and fix what&#x27;s wrong. IF people agree with you, eventually they will end up using your fork. It&#x27;s as simple as that.<p>What is funny is to see John Gruber who appears to be butthurt about this, when his contributions have grown negligent (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8266574"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8266574</a>), inconsistent and his recent focus has been more on other (personal) things.[2]<p>This reminds me of Luca Pasani[3], who released the much popular WURFL repository as open source in a liberal license first, then one fine day, cried foul because other people (including companies) were using it for profit (in accordance with the license), deleted all online repositories and instances of the project released under the old liberal license [4], then re-released the project with a comparatively restrictive license.[5]<p>In my opinion, releasing something for open, public consumption means you have to develop an honest mindset of accepting that other people WILL benefit from your creation eventually. If you don&#x27;t get that right, then open source is probably isn&#x27;t for you. (And crying foul later, is a double standard, if you do)<p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12424617/comparing-lift-with-play2#comment20481903_12428316"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12424617/comparing-lift-w...</a><p>[2] like writing controversial Apple articles at daringfireball.<p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Passani"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Passani</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WURFL#License_update"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WURFL#License_update</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://yro.slashdot.org/story/12/01/09/169216/wurfl-founders-fire-off-dmca-takedown-against-fork"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yro.slashdot.org/story/12/01/09/169216/wurfl-founders...</a>",1409817532

The low cost of living is one advantage over the bigger cities.  While Oak Ridge is very cutting-edge in terms of science, the south isn&#x27;t near the forefront of technology like California is, so it would be nice to see at least one city around here make a push in that direction, and it seems like Chattanooga is certainly working towards it.

I would take them to my street corner and a driver would pick them up and deliver them to a digitizer. They could show up in the cloud a week later, or be delivered back to me in a hard drive.<p>Once the digital copies are received, the customer can request to have the goods responsibly disposed of. The service could also cover long term storage for customers who want the originals to remain intact. Possessions can be returned to the owner within a day or two&#x27;s notice.<p>A service like this would allow people to minimize their physical existence while preserving the memories associated with physical possessions.",1409815135

I would rather see a potential lender&#x27;s credit report than how I am connected to them on Facebook.<p>> <i>In practice, we&#x27;re committed to helping lenders and borrowers resolved problems...</i><p>Your FAQ states that lenders with loans in default should use &quot;conventional legal means&quot; because WeFinance &quot;isn&#x27;t a party to your contract&quot;. If there are other things you do, prospective lenders would probably want to see it.<p>> <i>We&#x27;ve also individually interviewed each borrower and are confident on the identity verification front...</i><p>I don&#x27;t know if this means you have exchanged emails with them, had a phone call, or met them in person. I don&#x27;t know if you are using some third-party service to verify identity, or just verifying that they have a Facebook profile. In an earlier comment, you said that all borrowers have stable jobs and good credit histories, but your FAQ explicitly states that you do not check credit or employment.<p>It&#x27;s possible that you&#x27;re assuming that this site will be used by people lending money to people that they already know in real life, in which case most of my concerns above are invalid or irrelevant.

This tends to be a target that fraudsters like to utilize. They&#x27;ll &quot;donate&quot; small amounts to the non-profit in order to check if the transaction went through. If the transaction was approved, they know the card is still valid. Meanwhile, we&#x27;re stuck with the fraudulent transaction and have to refund the charge.<p>Now, these charges are clearly fraudulent. Without going into details, we can 100% detect the fraudulent transactions from real ones. I&#x27;ve suggested to Stripe that this could be a honey-pot setup to identify stolen cards but they&#x27;ve told me that there card processing doesn&#x27;t have that type of infrastructure. Even if I know a credit card number has been compromised, there is no way to alert the card holder.<p>It&#x27;s a shame really.

Simply announce &quot;Show us a competing bid, and we&#x27;ll give you 10x.&quot;  Sure, there are some who will say &quot;I hate Americans; I sell only to Ukrainians,&quot; but because vulnerability finding is increasingly automation-assisted, the seller who won&#x27;t sell to the Americans knows that his vulns can be rediscovered in due course by someone who <i>will</i> sell to the Americans who will tell everybody, thus his need to sell his product before it outdates is irresistible. This strategy&#x27;s usefulness comes from two side effects: (1) that by overpaying we enlarge the talent pool of vulnerability finders and (2) that by making public every single vuln the USG buys we devalue them.  Put differently, by overpaying we increase the rate of vuln finding, while by showing everyone what it is that we bought we zero out whatever stockpile of cyber weapons our adversaries have.  We don&#x27;t need intelligence on what weapons our adversaries have if we have something close to a complete inventory of the world&#x27;s vulns and have shared that with all the affected software suppliers.<p>Source: <a href=""http://geer.tinho.net/geer.blackhat.6viii14.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geer.tinho.net/geer.blackhat.6viii14.txt</a><p>Video: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT-TGvYOBpI&t=36m45s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT-TGvYOBpI&t=36m45s</a>",1409814698

For big paranoid companies where people need a lot of CYA, that can be a big point.<p>Good RESTful approaches are actually self-documenting. As the example from my recent talk on REST at SD West shows, it's really easy to support human discoverable (i.e., well documented) RESTful solutions. In my example, hitting the root resource returns a page (in html or text) that shows how to interact with the resource with actual examples.  That's way better then some horribly verbose WSDL that somebody is going to have to look up.",1207146844

153026,comment,151980,152969,0,0,euccastro,,,"TBH I've never played Second Life, but from what I've read it's more of a social sandbox than a direct competition. The space setting is more associated with combat and domination. It seems more likely that nonhackers will call foul on any disadvantage, real or perceived.<p>In my experience advocating player scripting in a MMO forum, I've observed that there is much prejudice against real life <i>technical</i> skills. Players seem to have less of a problem with other real life factors having an impact. Factors such as social skills or ability/willingness to spend more time on the game. I think this is because it takes technical skills to evaluate the true impact of mechanics involving technical skills, in order to come to the conclusion that they are mostly benign.<p>OTOH, I've also observed that some nontechnical people actually like scriptability and others can be convinced (with some difficulty; they often assume you're trying to skew the game towards your abilities for the sake of getting an edge) <i>if</i> you have the chance. And of course, people that can program absolutely love the feature. Unless you start with millions and a recognized IP, I think your best bet is making some underserved audience <i>love</i> your game rather than try to please the mainstream.<p>So I was playing devil's advocate here. As I said, I myself would love player scripting, and if I was to make a MMO, I'd bite the bullet. But whatever you do, I think these are factors to take into account.",1207146414

153024,comment,152684,152924,0,0,jcl,,,"I think their point is not that the resolution of human data is lower (although I expect it is quite a bit lower than 44k Hz).  Instead, I think they are pointing out that fewer data points are necessary.<p>If your jazz drummer plays eight notes in a second, the timing alone can be represented in eight floating point numbers (a higher resolution than CD audio); the data is 8 * 8 bytes -- much smaller than the 44k * 4 bytes of raw audio samples that would be needed for a second of stereo CD audio.  (I realize a drummer's performance encompasses several other variables, but these data points are similarly sparse relative to CD audio.)",1207146302

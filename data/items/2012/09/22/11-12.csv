4557673,comment,4554669,4555814,5,0,_delirium,,,"Certainly there is a large contribution made by markets, but in the western world markets still failed to fully solve the problem, and it took government intervention in the mid 20th century to really push down the mortality numbers, which were still quite high despite the ready availability of soap. The biggest problem is that there were few doctors, hospitals, or vaccination facilities available in certain areas, especially rural areas and poor urban areas, where there wasn't enough money to attract such services. So there was a big push in the US, Canada, and Europe to subsidize healthcare penetration into such areas, by building rural clinics and posting doctors and nurses to such areas. That reduced rates of many previously endemic diseases, increased vaccination rates, and resulted in more children being born in hygienic settings with medical oversight.<p>A related problem, possibly just as big, was that there was very bad information available, especially again in rural areas; people just were not educated on best practices, and were wasting their money on snake oil while failing to take basic steps that actually work. The Canadian government started combatting that as early as the 1920s, by sending out public health nurses to give vaccines and help educate people in rural areas, and printing up pamphlets and books with information: <a href=""http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/health-promotion/health-home.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/healt...</a>",1348315040

If you want to beat Facebook you need to beat the user experience of Facebook instead of thinking how to make the internals of social network better. Distributed social network does offer good privacy, but privacy is not enough to compete with Facebook and you can have good privacy settings with centralized social network.<p>Personally I recently decided to delete my Facebook account because everything was getting annoying to use in Facebook like messages not getting sent, five clicks to remove a friend and other annoying stuff.

It's far easier to come up with (and understand!) examples of functions that are smooth when considered as real maps from R^2 to itself, but nowhere homomorphic when considered as complex functions of a single complex variable, though. Complex conjugation is an obvious example: as the real map (x,y) -> (x,-y), it's linear, so smooth, but only holomorphic at points where 1 = -1, so nowhere. Complex conjugation <i>restricted to the real line</i> does have an obvious holomorphic extension, of course!",1348313817

There are a lot of people who are better at making films than I am - but very few of them were also competent at editing Quake levels.<p>But more trivially, there are dozens of times when you can cross over your skills to achieve results a specialist couldn't. Patrick has referred to one of his in the past - if you're knowledgeable about both advertising best practise and Web programming, you can create landing pages which are generated programatically to appeal to the inbound traffic from your PPC ads.<p>That's a nice bit of synergy which I believe has netted him a non-trivial amount of money in the past. If you're a programmer and an ad guy, it probably seems like an obvious thing to do - but if you're just one or the other, I can assure you it's not.<p>Look at two fields you know, preferably both valuable ones, and see if you can figure out things you can teach from your knowledge of both that most people wouldn't be able to.<p>(Another more trivial example: I've recently done some consulting work on PPC ads for a Pilates instructor friend of mine, considerably assisted by actually knowing a reasonable amount about Pilates. There are a lot of PPC ad people out there. There are a lot of people who know Pilates out there. The number of people in the intersection of the two sets, however, is small enough that I'm considering spinning the area out as a specialised consultancy.)",1348313708

That's a reasonable proxy for revenue growth because whenever the startup does start trying to make money, their revenues will probably be a constant multiple of active users""</i><p>This, for me, is the weak point in an otherwise excellent article. A lot of investments, valuations and jobs rest on this assumption. Facebook's PE ratio is currently 127, this assumption is the reason that it isn't around the same level as other entertainment companies like, say, Disney (17) or News Corp (56). And when Facebook's valuation rises like that and people invest at that level then there's a whole lot of money for paying engineers >$100k salaries and buying up pre-revenue businesses like Instagram. So, even if you're Google and you're bringing in real money, the application of this assumption to a few big cases permeates through the whole system and means that you too have to pay engineers >$100k and you too have to pay more to get hold of someone like Nik (makers of Snapseed).<p>PG logic appears flawless, but as a seed fund manager in the middle of this ecosystem, he's working several layers of abstraction up from some big applications of this assumption. So much so that it probably doesn't feel like an assumption to him. After all, he didn't value Facebook[1] at that level.<p>I genuinely hope this assumption is correct, because a lot of people and livelihoods are depending on it.<p>[1] I'm using Facebook here as an exemplar, I'm sure there are lots of other companies out there with valuations that are due in part to the assumption that users = revenue. My argument is that when someone sets a valuation based on this assumption it has a knock on effect to the whole ecosystem.",1348313166

4557635,comment,4554160,4554160,1,0,alid,,,"Navigating corporate bureaucracy (its politics, legacy systems and cost centers) is the pain point and the reason efficiencies are sometimes not implemented, even by people working within corporations. That said I see that very thing as the opportunity - there are tricks that smart operators use to navigate enterprises successfully. To get a foot in the door, track down some relevant contacts (friends, LinkedIn etc). Contact them and offer to take them to coffee/lunch to chat about what you can do for them. Don't go hard on the sales pitch at this point - just build rapport. At the coffee, it's all about learning about them - what are the strategic priorities of their business unit, and the company as a whole? (You need to slot into this). What would success look like to them? (This is not just results and efficiencies for the company, but your contact within the company will want the internal kudos for pushing through change with minimal pain and maximum visible benefit). Stage three is to provide them with the proposal - the pressure point here is to feed your contact all the materials and party lines they need to get you across the line with their various internal stakeholders. Help them help themselves - case studies and referees help here, and enterprises are all about the 'value add', so emphasize your 'above and beyond', added-value features. Your branding and market positioning will also need to align with the standard of enterprise you're aiming to work with - e.g. if you're aiming for top-tier enterprises you'll need prestige branding and a value proposition akin to being 'smart' or 'efficient' or 'innovative' etc. Many large enterprises have 'preferred supplier' or 'preferred vendor' lists so (depending on your product/service) you'll want to edge your way onto it - it helps to belong to any relevant industry associations and undertake a bit of healthy corporate social responsibility (offset your carbon usage, pro-bono charity work etc). Once you have one enterprise on board, leverage that connection to get to their competitors. (A slow-cooker version of consumer virality - name drop to their competitors that you've been working with them, and they're more likely to jump on the bandwagon). I'm sorry if I'm rambling, I hope this helps! :)",1348313118

Puts them in a very simple database.  This should be 100% trouble-free copyright-wise at least in the US.  The larger issue becomes what happens under other laws.  However building a generic tool to extract (non-copyright-worthy!) facts from ads should by itself be more or less trouble-free.<p>Make this generic enough to work on most ad sites out there.

I disagree with your first, second, third, fourth and fifth paragraphs (too much hyperbole!). Android might've been bad, but is quite allright now (in many areas, including ""intents"" it's <i>far</i> ahead of iOS. Though in ease of use, ease of development and things like Core2D/CoreData lags behind iOS). iOS maps is good IMO, but worse than current GMaps.<p>The company is not infallible.

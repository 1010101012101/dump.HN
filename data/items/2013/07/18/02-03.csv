6061516,comment,6060143,6060143,1,0,statusgraph,,,"What this analysis shows is the flaw of trying to reason with percentage: the modeling is too difficult and littered with assumptions.<p>An alternative model: say you&#x27;re offered $100/yr with 10k options a year with a nominal value of $5 and a strike price of $1. Superficially the offer is worth $140/yr. The startup&#x27;s valuation is still important, because you can ask yourself questions about how likely they are to double it. It&#x27;s much easier to project if the company can double to 10x it&#x27;s value than what their exit is going to be.<p>Say that startup is worth $1mm. If they can double it to $2mm you&#x27;re going to be netting $100 + 10k<i>(10-1) = $190k. But can they double it? Up to your impression of their business. That&#x27;s a much simpler question than wondering about their exit many years down the line. (their competitors generally are the strongest signals)<p>Observations:<p></i> this is computed with options per year; most startups would put this as giving you 40k options over four years\n* the options companies give you generally have expirations and very poor liquidity so using their face value is generous. [1]\n* but on the other hand, options can potentially increase in value, so it&#x27;s not wholly unreasonable to equate them to their face value\n* this approach cuts out nearly all early stage startups which give below-market salaries and weak equity grants. Getting 50bp of a $10mm startup over four years is $12.5k/yr face value. If market salary is $100 and they&#x27;re offering $75 you&#x27;re netting around $87.5. That&#x27;s a pretty stiff cut.\n* dilution isn&#x27;t relevant (assuming you have options on reasonable stock)\n* if the startup is doing well (say, after a year doubles their valuation) it&#x27;s difficult to negotiate another grant because you&#x27;re now paid quite a bit better. Conversely, if the startup is doing poorly time to ask for more.\n* you may be okay with the pay cut because of externalities (more interesting work, good for the resume, better commute, etc.)<p>(ps. I normalized all salaries to $100k because it&#x27;s easy to do percentages off of. Adjust by industry and specialization.)<p>[1]: That said, if you have reasonable timing you can use this computation to negotiate comp when changing companies so you&#x27;re not completely handcuffed.

They want either the black bars removed and the area filled with images (like Photoshop Content-Aware Fill?), or the whole movie zoomed in (cropped) so that the sides are lost. I, along with some of the other serious movie-watchers in the family, have to convince these individuals every time that no, that&#x27;s not how you watch a movie. (My favorite argument: &quot;That area is reserved for subtitles.&quot;)<p>But I don&#x27;t think most of the general public cares about the aspect ratio, only about utilizing the maximum square footage of their overpriced TV. Netflix is just catering to this demographic, just like DVD vendors who came up with 4:3 versions of 2.39:1 movies.

It was pointed out on the Go developer mailing list a few days before your post, and you can see my reply there.<p>NewRequest should take an io.ReadCloser. Unfortunately, due to backwards compatibility, a long standing semantic mistake like this is not something we can just fix, but we&#x27;ve at least documented it.<p>The tweet you quoted is wrong, and I want to explain why. If an interface value v is passed to a function f, then what does happen from time to time is that f will look for custom methods on v that are at least logically equivalent to the static interface type f is declared to expect. For example, io.Copy takes an io.Reader and an io.Writer and does the obvious thing, Reading into a buffer and then passing that buffer to Write. Of course, it would be nice to bypass the buffer when possible, and so there is a standard WriterTo interface that an io.Reader can also implement that, in contrast to Read, which copies into a buffer, says &quot;read the data out of yourself and directly into this Writer&quot;. If io.Copy finds that method, it will use it, but the operation - reading - is the same. There is an analogous case for the Writer too. If you pass a value v to json.Marshal, Marshal will check to see if v implements json.Marshaler, meaning v knows how to marshal itself as JSON, in which case v is given that opportunity. Again, same operation you requested.<p>In contrast, if you have an io.Reader, while it might be okay to look for other Read-like methods, it is certainly not okay to look for Close. That&#x27;s a very different operation, it&#x27;s surprising, and it shouldn&#x27;t be there. FWIW, I&#x27;m not aware of any other instances of this kind of semantic mixup in the standard library. But again, unfortunately, we can&#x27;t change it until Go 2. All we can do for now is document it and move on.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;",1374114843

Or India.

There are very few industries (like retail, with Walmart and Amazon) where this can be done. Mobile manufacturing is likely not one of them (case in point: Huawei and ZTE eating Samsung&#x27;s bottom).<p>The only threat for Apple is a global movement towards ending carrier subsidy, so consumers would have to finally pay full price for their devices.<p>But that seems unlikely. Consumers still don&#x27;t know how to do math.<p>[1] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444165804578005722309270246.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000087239639044416580457800...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.asymco.com/2012/05/03/the-phone-market-in-2012-a-tale-of-two-disruptions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asymco.com/2012/05/03/the-phone-market-in-2012-a-...</a>",1374114575

This increases power of government significantly because people are now dependant on these handouts for their livelihood.<p>3) Reduce expectations of quality of life.

6061335,comment,6060954,6061203,6,0,teawithcarl,,,"After receiving 5000 karma points in June alone, due to the intersection of Snowden news and my 27 years researching China - I noticed that my posts started getting downvoted heavily by HN management.<p>HN management apparently does not believe Snowden news is hacker news. Assange, Jacob Appelbaum, and Snowden have more than proven their hacker skills in software, and censoring that news is not tolerable to me. All the YC companies combined are insignificant compared that important work.<p>Personally, I believe we&#x27;ve already reached &quot;peak&quot; Hacker News and &quot;peak&quot; Y Combinator. Even though I respect YC, HN, and PG, the main problem is that the number of users continues to grow, and the basic code behind HN hasn&#x27;t changed in years. Indeed, what new code there is seems to be refinement in excluding people.<p>Journalists worldwide are descending on HN as a clear cut seminal news source, and no software is being written to maintain the integrity of HN, given the new influx of lay users.  Banning is a blunt, ineffective tool to manage HN growth.<p>I am one of the earliest software engineers on earth (42 years), and remember/prefer the early pure days of HN (as we all do).  I have many ideas how to solve that, however more and more hell banning wont do it. Give a man a hammer and everything looks like a nail.  Ward Cunningham&#x27;s (inventor of the wiki) new work on federated wikis is excellent, trailblazing work on maintaining purity in an fast growing editorial environment. Allowing multiple &quot;views&quot; of HN is a better approach. Google Search does it well - every Google user has a unique &quot;view&quot;, even on identical search terms.<p>Partly, I think PG would rather maintain his personal bully pulpit (he&#x27;s earned it) than build a better mousetrap at HN.   Editorial monoculture is always easier to build than an open multiview.<p>Funny part is, an open design would allow the original pure HN to be one of the &quot;views&quot; (and likely the main view). HN will never ban its way back to purity.<p>Attempts to return to purity via downvoting, censorship, and hell banning alone are bad software. The fact that HN leadership thinks this way is the primary reason for the fall in quality at HN.  The growth in readership does not have to dumb down HN. Write better software.<p>I&#x27;ve contributed solidly to the HN community, especially with early breaking news in China technology, censorship, and gov&#x27;t sponsored hacking. Yet, I&#x27;m 80% banned, even though my careful submits ranked #1 on the HN leaderboard in June.<p>I have never spammed, never organized up voting, and have abided by the the rules as I understand them.<p>The ban hammer is a tool, but a relatively an ineffective tool.   It won&#x27;t solve the problem.",1374113066

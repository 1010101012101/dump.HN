1205265,comment,1204455,1204455,0,0,drats,,,"Just installed an Intel budget ssd two days ago, fresh updated install of Ubuntu 9.10 had the boot time cut down by  just over 10 seconds compared to the mechanical drive. Apps start very quickly GIMP, Blender, OO Writer et cetera are all under 2 seconds. 2-3 meg pngs opening in the GIMP take a fraction of a second. ""sudo hdparm -tT /dev/sda1"" nets ~1330MB/sec over many runs for cached reads on the Intel and on the two mechanical drives. Buffered disk reads on the Intel are in the 156MB/sec range, and 51 and 58MB/sec on the mechanical drives. 6 seconds or so to transfer half a gig of DV video from the mech to the ssd. It's also very quiet so you don't have that grinding on boot or opening a folder with pdf/image previews. Chrome and Firefox don't seem to have the stalls that they did earlier when transferring to disk. Installation plate to fit into the 3.5"" bay was fiddly even with a removable hdd cage, so was plugging in the cables as it's such a tiny drive. Very pleased all up, 5/5 on value (remember it's only 40gig though).",1269032393

1205256,comment,1203953,1205078,0,0,Periodic,,,"If you cache on the level of SQL-statement strings you can skip the transformation into the AST.  It's very cheap to quickly hash the string and look it up.  If you have a site that is going to use the same queries over and over (e.g. for front-page data or popular categories) then the query will likely be exactly the same and the string hash is cheaper.  If you had to build an AST for every single query you're just adding an extra layer of complexity that won't gain you much.<p>The only reason I can think of for a query with different literals in the conditionals to have a different plan would be if a histogram of frequencies was actually kept such that different literals created large differences in result sizes which then get fed into a join and affect the join logic.  But that's going to be pretty rare and is a level of optimization that is unnecessary.  It's also not going to make a huge difference unless the query is very complex, because the plans for simple queries are... simple.",1269032238

A nice, kind, female police officer started talking to me. She asked me how old I was. I replied that I was 18 (Ontario had 13 grades at the time and I was in OAC, the last grade). She then asked me if I'd laid a hand on any of the people. I said, ""yes I pulled back my friend and separated them"". She then warned me that I could be charged for assault and tried as an adult. At first I thought she was joking, so I kind of chuckled, but she let the thought linger over my head while I tried to figure out what she was getting at. What she really wanted me to do was play along with the report of how things went down, which I'd disagreed with. I quickly weighed the options, determined that no charges would be laid if we just helped this officer out and kept her paper work to the minimum, and went along... Not my proudest moment, but perhaps quite smart.<p>What's my point? You think you know what you're going to do in a situation like that, but the police hold all the cards. Things can escalate uncontrollably. All you need is a peace officer having a bad day (e.g., maybe the wife yelled at him earlier in the day) for things to get really bad. I've seen people get picked on by police when they literally didn't do anything except ask ""Why?"" and often in a polite way. It's quite possible that the author really is the victim here. It's certainly more plausible than the border guard's story. When crossing the U.S. border, I'm terrified to even wish them a good morning/afternoon.

For years I thought <i>I</i> was the crazy one for telling our clients, ""we don't really need to validate names.  if they give you the wrong name, it's their problem; and it's more work for us; and we'll probably fuck it up and make someone mad"".  The answer was always ""do it anyway, it's what we agreed on.""  The client feels like we are screwing them if we make the work easier, even though the end result is a higher-quality more usable website.   Sigh.<p>The comment about developers making work for themselves is also spot on.  I answer a lot of programming questions, and the questions are always asked because the programmer has reached the end of a twisty maze of his own creation.  Turn around, walk, spin around, and try again.  You'll find a better solution.<p>And oh yeah, I do this all the fucking time.  Pick any random github project of mine, and you'll see 8 revisions of the API before I finally pick one that's not retarded.  Even then.  (Side note: I don't change the API after I release.)<p>Anyway, best rant ever.",1269029389

It's quite possible that random chance sank the parent commenter and not anything he did. On average the quality of the Google hiring process may be high but it is far from consistent. They've hired some people I consider incompetent. My own interview process was horrible. A friend of mine (who is awesome) had a challenging interview process and they hired him anyway because they liked the way he thought (that's how it is supposed to work!).<p>They seem to hire good people on average.

But improvisation can also be done with non-random-sounding notes:  Mozart's variations on ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" are very impressive.  The difference being that with Mozart you can still hear a melody.  You'd have to be really good to do this on the fly in a solo, though, which is probably why a lot of the great jazz bands practiced beforehand (it wasn't strictly improv)",1269029025

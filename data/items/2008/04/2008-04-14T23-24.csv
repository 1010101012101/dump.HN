The founder of Intuit once said that 'your competition isn't other companies, but the way things are done now'.  Some companies like to invent ideas about what people actually do.  Therefore: observe how people spend their time, and make something that makes that better or more valuable.  Then you can make sure you're not making something 'actually bad'!",1208217082

1. I do have enough funds to last 6 to 8 months on my own if I had to.<p>2. I'm not sure if I'm going to learn much on the project I am on because now my role is more advisory, but I will interact with potential service providers for my startup.<p>3. I do think that I have issues focusing on two projects at the same time because I like to do a good job on whatever I'm doing. This also means that there is a good possibility of me spending more than 10 hours a week on the project.<p>4. We have been talking to a small set of our future customers, and they can't wait for it to launch. And it needs to launch now.<p>I've made the decision to go 100% on my startup, and not worry about consulting. Someone reminded me how I worked through college and have always regretted it, wishing I would've have just taken a loan and paid more attention, had fun, etc. I don't want to look back at this and say ""If I just did it 100%""<p>Thanks for all your advice and opinions, it really did help.",1208216909

What google has done is quite interesting. By commoditising the application server software, & reducing the cost, it means more Startups can quickly move to the market.

163596,comment,163429,163579,0,0,palish,,,"""Solved"" certainly shouldn't mean ""avoided entirely"".  One way to write good software is to quickly recover from mistakes.  So instead of staring at your code while you triple-check each corner case, you approach the problem from the other direction by testing each code path until you're confident that the code runs as it should for the inputs that matter.  (Be sure to assert for all other inputs).<p>In that light, it is easy to see why it can be good to crash for invalid cases.  Since you don't handle a bunch of failure cases, you end up writing less code.  And since less time is spent in the debugger, more time is focused on the correct task: achieving architectural goals rather than solving structural problems.<p>After you acquire a deeper understanding of the architecture, it is best to redesign (throw away) your previous attempt.  After the second and especially the third iteration you will have written a solid and elegant program in a relatively small amount of time.  Programming is about trusting yourself to make decent decisions based on your current knowledge.<p>As with anything, there is only a finite amount of time to solve a problem.  So if you don't have a lot of time then don't fret if your code isn't perfect (or reusable) as long as it works.",1208215799

163593,comment,163552,163552,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"Comparisons to Google are worthless, primarily for 2 reasons:<p>1. Every logical mind (even within Google) in 1999 would have seen that Google was heading for failure - there was no money in search. They got lucky in finding one -adwords - that worked.
2. Had the timing of their discovery been off, or had the dot-com bubble busted a few months earlier, they would have died.<p>In saying that, they are useless as a measure of anything because they are such an anomaly that they shouldn't be used as a guidepost to success. In other words: If you were to operate the way Google did today, 99 times out of 100 you would fail. They are the exception to the rule.<p>Although, PG's comparison to Facebook is apt, as they're also in the same position as Google was. I'll put my money on them being in the majority though.<p>I did like Paul's point about VC's, but then again, you could extend that to how pretty much any industry operates.

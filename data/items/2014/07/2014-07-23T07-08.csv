8073331,comment,8071438,8073103,1,0,Moto7451,,,"A couple reasons come to mind (not all mine, nor do I necessarily agree with them):<p>For one, US citizens are expected to pay taxes on money they earn outside the US, even if they reside outside the country. This, in and of itself, rubs people the wrong way. In some cases, Canada comes to mind, your US taxes are reduced by what you paid to Canada. This isn&#x27;t the case everywhere. The more people-like corporations become, depending on your politics, the more likely you are to feel like the tax law should treat individuals and corporations similarly. Yes, this ignores a lot of the actual economic realities of corporations, but feelings and politics be damned :).<p>Two, the fact that the corporations in question are housed in the US means that somewhere along the line, there is likely some sort of tax break, credit, loan, law, or incentive program that they&#x27;ve been given to advantage them. After all, what large corporation doesn&#x27;t have lobbyists and large building projects that can get funding from state and local governments. Some industries get subsidies directly from the government (The oil industry&#x27;s subsidy being a popular one for political bile). Additionally, like people, corporations benefit from functioning civil services, roads and highways, and the protection of the military. These are all things that cost money (and no, lobbying dollars aren&#x27;t going to cover that :).<p>Lastly, if you&#x27;re more socialist leaning you likely wouldn&#x27;t mind seeing a social safety net of some kind like a universal government stipend. Large corporate profits seem like an ends to a means in terms of executing that. I don&#x27;t think a majority of US citizens feel like that&#x27;s a great plan, but I&#x27;ve heard it suggested by some very left leaning thinkers.",1406102349

The key to scaling IMHO is to avoid the ball-of-mud where every feature interacts with every other feature, making the design impossible to disentangle and modify sanely. In software engineering terms, we want low coupling. So we choose the right <i>primitives</i> at the lowest level, such that additional requirements/feature requests can be built by composing primitives or attaching add-ons or using a well-defined hook interface or somesuch.

Like when you send an API call with JSON, isn&#x27;t there a standard set of keys that the server is expecting? Isn&#x27;t it nicer to actually write down this set of keys and their expected types in a way that a machine can understand, instead of it just being documentation on a web page?<p>I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s not.<p>Your schema is implicitly defined somewhere in the business logic, and you have to first learn the schema description language in order to translate your application code into schema description code.  And when the application code changes, you won&#x27;t be very excited to adjust the schema again.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s worth the effort and makes development easier, often it&#x27;s the opposite.

What I was trying to say was all the <i>best practices</i> and <i>standard way of doing things</i> are not set in stone and should be evaluated at every instance. Beginners write very <i>inflexible</i> code. When intermediate, they learn best practices and about making it flexible and keeping room for the future. But only after seeing enough projects in production, one will know which flexibilities make sense to the project at hand and which don&#x27;t.<p>For example, some changes even though very easy to implement are very difficult to push in production because of requirement of senior management approvals.<p>Also, best practices depend on the actual environment that you work on. For e.g. In one of the projects, the DBA team had very cool people compared to the server admins who were a pain to deal with even when we had all the approvals. So we decided to keep the configurations in a table and not xml, as changes could be pushed easily!",1406099455

Neither Textmate nor Sublime Text, nor Atom seem to be able to stand up to the two old ones in term of development community and community involvement.<p>Maybe it is a question of novelty. Vim still has unmatched key bindings. Emacs atill has unmatched total flexibility. Textmate had snippets (which now everyone has), Sublime Text has multiple cursors (which is maybe not a big enough improvements over macros to matter). Light Table seemed interesting, but probably too narrow in scope. My hope is that Atom&#x27;s openness will finally allow it to transcend its brethren.

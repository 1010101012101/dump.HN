10639688,comment,10639418,10639418,0,0,_jomo,,,"I&#x27;ve been more and more concerned about Telegram recently. Here&#x27;s a mail I sent them recently covering most of these concerns. Naturally, I got no response.<p>&quot;\nHey there Telegram!<p>I have been an early Telegram user since late 2013 and was highly optimistic that it would become a perfect messenger.\nIt&#x27;s quite perfect from a UX point of view – which is important to gain users – but other things aren&#x27;t that perfect.<p>You claim to be open and secure, but taking a closer look that doesn&#x27;t seem to be true. Your API is open and the client apps were released as open source, but your server-side code remains closed source. It&#x27;s been 2 years now and you still haven&#x27;t open sourced the server. Do you still plan to release it? You say that you will eventually add paid options, which doesn&#x27;t seem to be compatible to open-sourcing the server.<p>Of course one would have to trust you that you actually use that version of the server on your side, which leads to the second issue that concerns me. You advertise being secure a lot, but default chats don&#x27;t use end-to-end encryption and secure chats aren&#x27;t even possible for group chats. Even for encrypted chats a bunch of concerns were raised by much respected people in the security community, I&#x27;m sure you are aware of that and will not brag about that here.<p>I opened an issue on the Android app&#x27;s issue tracker in early 2014 about end-to-end encryption (<a href=""https://archive.is/9SfYt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.is/9SfYt</a>). There have been dozens of comments on that issue, discussing how it could be implemented but there was no official reply by the Android maintainer or any official Telegram account, despite numerous attempts.<p>The Android app&#x27;s maintainer also doesn&#x27;t seem to understand version control / git and commits tons of changes in a single commit and also doesn&#x27;t use tags for versioning. He also doesn&#x27;t merge pull requests but rather includes them in his large commits (thus also removing all attribution). There are also binary blobs in the source code and there are various licensing issues. All these issues have been raised but the Android maintainer doesn&#x27;t seem to care about it.<p>The issue tracker for that app has now been closed by the maintainer and there was no explanation for this. Several people tried several times to reach out to the maintainer, but he never replied. I believe this is a huge problem for a security app, and for open source apps in general.<p>Last but not least, the current version of Telegram on the Google Play Store (3.2.4) is not open source.<p>Of course, client apps don&#x27;t have anything to do with the server implementation, API, or general issues about Telegram. You&#x27;ve linked a Trello board somewhere deep on your website, but the link is broken. It&#x27;s a major issue that there is no way to discuss problems, feature requests, or ask questions to the developers (we don&#x27;t even know who the developers are). There is a community-run Telegram support account and a press contact and there&#x27;s this email address and a Twitter account. Obviously none of these work as a discussion / issue platform, and you don&#x27;t seem to reply to Telegram questions or Twitter.<p>A very good way to fix this is creating an organization account on GitHub and create a repo where you can use the issue tracker and wiki. You could also move the &quot;official&quot; clients to that account to have them at one place and you could use it to open-source or document other things related to Telegram.<p>It&#x27;s also not clear at all who runs Telegram. All your website says is that it&#x27;s financially supported by Pavel Durov and technically supported by Nikolai Durov. Your official apps and AS Networks are registered by &quot; Telegram Messenger LLP&quot; or &quot;Telegram LLP&quot; and your website claims your headquarters are based in Berlin, although no such company seems to be registered in the EU. You are legally required to publish your address and contact information to comply with German law §5 TMG. Additionally, both the LLP&#x27;s and Nikolai&#x27;s address are apparently at (different) British P.O. boxes.\nIs Nikolai the only developer or are there more? How are the official maintainers related to the LLP? Are they paid? Are they employees? Are there any employees at all? Who runs the company?<p>I&#x27;m really trying to not hate you and hope that you are what you claim to be, but it seems like you advertise security and openness successfully, so that the average user and the press buys it, but taking a closer look you seem rather shady without being very open. I feel very sad about this and hope you&#x27;ll improve that.<p>Please shed some light and address these issues, most importantly a public issue tracker / discussion forum.<p>Thank you!\n– jomo\n&quot;",1448675561

10639657,comment,10639398,10639398,0,0,tcj_phx,,,"I was recently arrested for the first time.<p>My girlfriend had ended up in the behavioral health wing of the hospital emergency room when she decided to quit methadone cold-turkey, without any medical support for the withdrawal. When they wouldn&#x27;t let her go after she&#x27;d come to her senses, I went to the courts and obtained an order that the hospital release her. The hospital staff, acting on incorrect legal advice from their staff attorney (who decided to not attend my court hearing), didn&#x27;t want to hear about the court&#x27;s order.<p>I went to the area of my girlfriend&#x27;s room. The windows are one-way mirrors, but she saw me and started tapping gleefully. I showed her the court order, and did a little dance while waiting for the police to arrive.<p>Then the entire security staff showed up to deal with me. The &quot;old man&quot; security guard freaked out when I took out my camera-phone to take selfies to document the situation, and tried to remove my phone from my hands. I backed away while trying to switch my phone to video mode...<p>The wanna-be-cop escalated the fight. Three or four of them wrestled me to the ground while trying to remove my phone from my hands. Eventually I was over-powered and handcuffed. The security guards finally managed to pry my phone from my handcuffed hands. It dropped to the concrete a few feet away, and I got a good view of a boot stomping down to break the screen.<p>The police officer I&#x27;d called for showed up shortly thereafter, but it was six hospital security guards vs. me. The police officer and his superior called the superior court to verify that the case number on my court order was genuine, but it didn&#x27;t matter. My arresting officer was almost apologetic for taking their side. At the booking area, the officer took pictures of my scuffs and bruises, and of my phone&#x27;s broken screen (apparently this is much more than is done for most who are arrested).<p>As I was taking my concrete nap, I thought to contact a facebook-friend who went to Harvard Law School & ask him if he had anyone to recommend. I was released on my own recognizance after spending the night in the city jail&#x27;s holding cell. The next day I dropped $1000 on a retainer, which isn&#x27;t much lawyer-time at all, but it&#x27;s all I had. He&#x27;s been very helpful in helping me navigate the legal system.<p>When I got the police report a month later, I learned that the security guard told the police that I&#x27;d dropped my phone and hit him 3 times when he went to retrieve it. My video is quite brief, but strongly suggests that the security guard was not at all truthful with his statements that got me arrested for assault.<p>The next court date was a pretrial conference, about 3 weeks later. The city prosecutor offered a &quot;disorderly conduct&quot; plea. I signed up for a public defender, who I met after another month. He used to work for that hospital, a long time ago. He said something that was informative, but which greatly irritated me, so I borrowed a few thousand dollars from family for a private attorney.<p>This is going to take a while.<p>It is very hard to protect people from the system. If you ever find yourself getting caught up in something where the police might get involved, remember that video is much more valuable than photos...

Very often shops actually carry some muesli mix, but those are always many times more expensive than just buying oat flakes (I gather that the right term might be &quot;rolled oats&quot;) and mixing them with fruit (and optionally other kinds of grains, nuts etc.) yourself, and almost always I don&#x27;t like them as they don&#x27;t actually contain oats but wheat, contain more dried fruit than actual cereals, or have them roasted and mixed with sugar which makes them crunchy (some people seem to like that) but unhealthy and tends to hurt your gums. I find it quite perverse how forces are set up towards extracting money from you for worse health and, in my honest opinion, worse taste [2].<p>Even in Switzerland those mixes are getting an ever stronger foothold, but you can still buy bare rolled oats easily everywhere. In Canada and England you generally can&#x27;t buy them in the standard supermarket except if you&#x27;re lucky, but you can get them from health food stores, also some unexpected places like &quot;Jamaican Oats&quot; from a Jamaican food store. Some kinds found in alternative places are the inverse of mushy: pretty hard and with a tendency to be bitter, they are still usable if soaked over night though. So, it takes a bit of time to find the right source. There are smaller and bigger variants, this doesn&#x27;t really matter (other than giving a different texture).<p>I&#x27;m preparing them with zero added sugar (if you&#x27;re used to sweet cereals you may want to start with sugar and lower it over time), just oats, milk, yoghurt, fresh fruit, sometimes a small amount of raisins, and nuts, let them soak for a bit (at least about 15 minutes, e.g. while eating some bread, to ensure they are not dry anymore inside), and for guests add some cream for even better taste :).

Also, yoghurt made from whole milk and with no other ingredients (i.e. nature, no sugar or fruit or artificial flavoring).<p>[3] anecdotal evidence from myself: I&#x27;m slim, but put on weight when moving from Switzerland to Canada, but that stopped and reverted after I made an effort to find the food that I was used to, which involved finding oats for muesli, buying bread made from whole grains, (raw) sauerkraut (can be eaten raw with olive oil), etc. (I also felt stressed at that time, which may have had an effect as well.

So what? How does this make them more secure if the device cannot provide the public to the end-user so they can match it to the one they got in the SSH or HTTPS connection before they establish that connection? The problem here is a chicken or the egg one, plain and simple.  You can&#x27;t just ship root CAs on devices which will connect to other devices because you&#x27;d be distributing private keys on the device generating the certificate which could be used by a bad guy to make valid key material.<p>As it stands with existing implementations, if the end users accepts the security warnings and connects to the device, a man in the middle can simply tamper with the encrypted traffic so that when they view the device cert, it&#x27;s the one they see in the connection. This I&#x27;m afraid is the elephant in the room when it comes to device connectivity over protocols utilizing public / private key cryptography.<p>Of course this problem can be solved, but I would propose that it wouldn&#x27;t be cheap in many cases and doesn&#x27;t really solve the problem. For devices with no display output the manufacturer could fire the device up on the product line and then obtain the public after it is generated. They could then print it out or save it to a USB drive and put it in the box with the device. Ultimately; however, the end user getting the device will have no idea what that paper or USB drive is and it will be promptly ignored anyway and browser or SSH security warnings will be accepted just as they are today.\nThe assumption for all of these products should be that they are untrustworthy until made trustworthy, even if they are generating their own unique key material. With that in mind they should be configured on isolated, trusted networks until which point they are secured for environments which require this level of paranoia.<p>The only way to make them secure is if they can generate unique key material or accept organizational key material and then the connections are validated before establishing encrypted communication with the devices. Ideally this means having an organizational PKI program that can issue certificates to devices which are then validated against an organizational root CA or exporting the device generated public and importing it into hosts which will be used to connect with the device.  For NAT&#x27;d or firewalled networks this also necessitates local DNS.<p>This I believe is the conversation we need to be having here.  Are we in fact fooling ourselves on this one?  As I look at the entire market of devices which implement HTTPS and SSH to connect to things like embedded web servers I don&#x27;t see a solution which really allows anyone to secure anything unless you are in an organization with a solid PKI program and the device allows the use of organizational key material.",1448673214

A lot of what he does is &quot;adaptive&quot; for someone in his situation: accept flaws, celebrate chance, don&#x27;t sweat the small stuff. Keep producing. He can seem a bit twee at times and I think that is a problem with aestheticism in general.

Thanks for writing it.<p>It&#x27;s good for Udemy. If their business practices end up costing some content creators 87.5% of list price, then it&#x27;s because the evil and/or lazy forces in the company have gained ground, and this kind of sunshine may weaken them.<p>It&#x27;s good for content creators.<p>It&#x27;s good for consumers. As a potential customer of courses like yours, I was discouraged at seeing their incentivization of cheaper, spammier courses. Why? Because even if education is turned into a product, it&#x27;s is still a &quot;buy-it-for-life&quot; product where quality matters, and quality is the only metric I (and probably many of Udemy&#x27;s shoppers!) really care about. Anything that could result in less noise/spam in their signal is appreciated.<p>It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how Udemy responds.",1448672694

3124718,comment,3122312,3122312,0,0,reirob,,,"After reading through the comments, I come to the cynical conclusion that it is actually Google who is selling Microsoft products (if you consider IP a product). They are not selling it by taking money, but they are distributing Microsoft's products inside Android so that Microsoft can go along and collect the money from the ones who use Android to sell their phones. So what is the ""commission"" that Google takes for selling Microsoft's IP? Well, it allows them to sell their own products which is advertisement. And why are the phone manufacturers willing to pay to Microsoft? I guess because they figured out that it is cheaper to pay Microsoft if it allows them to sell more phones.<p>So it is a win-win situation for everybody except the end-costumers who buy the phone. As I said, this is just a cynical view, which might explain that nobody is not yet going to court.",1318935390

3124716,comment,3124505,3124505,5,0,geuis,,,"I think I'm a bit of a stick in the mud, as far as frontend engineers goes. I can visually see the effects that shaders allow in the Adobe demo videos. They're quite impressive. However, at this time I just don't think this has a place in css. SVG maybe, perhaps DOM api's accessible with javascript, but not css.<p>My thinking is that this is shoveling yet another spec that fellows like me have to learn and support.<p>For years, css2.1 wasn't quite enough to really do what we needed. To do even slightly advanced layouts we had to come up with all kinds of crazy html/css/image arrangements to do things. css3 was a welcome addition finally, especially as its widely supported in modern browsers now. It filled in many of the gaps that were missing.<p>css3 also added some interesting new features relating to animations. We got transitions, translations, animations, etc. The specs on these are fairly simple and really powerful once you learn them.<p>But unfortunately css isn't the only thing we have to know to do our jobs. We have to know html(5) layouts and rules. We have to know all of the in's and out's of how <i>every</i> popular browser implements the layout of html and css and all of their bugs. We've had to learn to use the newer html5 features, almost all of which were welcome. Even here though, we run into insanely stupid cross-platform issues like dealing with media formats for video and audio tags. Can you name support matrix of browsers for video and audio? I can, and it sucks that I had to learn that.<p>And lets also be honest, you can't truly be a well-rounded frontend engineer if you don't have at least a moderate amount of experience writing javascript. These days, you can't just get by only being the member of the team that lays out html & css. You need to be able to write javascript to make our increasingly interactive pages come alive.<p>Not only is javascript a lovely yet tricky language to learn, the bigger issue is dealing with the DOM api's for <i>each and every interactive DOM element</i>. And you have to know those DOM api's and how they differ for the most common browser platforms. Yeah, older versions of Internet Explorer are still popular enough to need supporting and their DOM api's can be insanely buggy and inconsistent.<p>To layer on top of that, now that we have awesome css3 features we also have to learn the DOM api's for <i>those</i> too!<p>At this point, many people reading this might start the valid argument that we have good javascript libraries (ok, only one and that's jQuery) to smooth over lots of those rough bits. Yeah, they help tremendously but its yet <i>another</i> thing that has to be learned to be effective.<p>Another thing is that css is really meant for layout and styling. While I truly love css3 animations and transitions, they're right on the border of needing to be somewhere else. They're wonderful for spicing up a page and doing cool designs that were impossible before but if they were even slightly more complex then I'd start arguing they shouldn't be in css.<p>Finally, getting back to the proposed css filters, I feel those are finally crossing that line. Like I said earlier, I may well be a stick in the mud Luddite but adding yet another css feature that literally lets you run code on the GPU is just too much. Its not layout any more and its moving into something further out than the css3 animation line.<p>One of the few reasons that I am up to speed on all of this stuff is that I've been doing it for years. I was able to learn this stuff gradually as it came out and get pretty good at it. However, if I were a younger version of myself getting started now I might read this comment I'm writing at length and get totally turned off from even trying to do frontend development.<p>I know there have to be others who disagree with my position. I'd love to get some other points of view that tell me where I'm wrong so I can re-analyze my thoughts on this. I'm open to change. Its just one more thing I have to learn.",1318935373

3124709,comment,3124620,3124620,4,0,saurik,,,"In case anyone finds this interesting (as it is so glaringly apropos to this ""Buy Now"" blog post): I ran an A/B test recently of ""Buy Now"" vs ""Purchase"" (which is a drastically different and more subtle question than comparing whether people want to install a demo vs. make a purchase), and found almost no difference.<p>Unfortunately, due to the usage of a multi-armed bandit algorithm (which attempts to ""exploit"" already learned knowledge to not lose sales during the test), my data is somewhat ""skewed"" (in that I have an order of magnitude more tests for one of the hypotheses), but here are the raw results:<p>""Purchase"": 35,715 sales from 3,255,882 impressions (1.097%)<p>""Buy Now"": 4,042 sales from 376,227 impressions (1.074%)<p>If you compare the confidence interfaces with a Beta distribution it is difficult to feel comfortable claiming Purchase is a winner, but that small benefit is why the algorithm kept trying to use it over the other case. Put differently: despite the large sample, I believe that tiny difference is not statistically significant.<p>(Additionally, for completeness, and as this is important for anyone who might care about this experiment: my app had previously said ""Purchase"", so there are likely guides online that tell the user how to buy things, or people may have had memories, which may have caused ""Buy Now"" to be ever so slightly more confusing.)",1318935231

It might as well be that because Haskell is hard, only people with a deep understanding and appreciation of computer science ever venture into it.

Simply listening to them (and their managers / team leads), maybe reading a couple of books on the subject would allow him to understand that in a way a bit of hobby programming simply won't.<p>The downside is that the lessons you learn as a beginner don't automatically scale to larger projects of the sort his development team(s) are working on. I've seen a business analysts who could code a bit, or managers with outdated skills, sell a development team down the river making assumptions based on what they think they know.<p>So yes it's good, but it's good with caveats.<p>Knowing how to develop is correlated with being a good manager of developers but it's not the only way to get some of the skills you need and, at this point in his career, it may not be the best way and certainly won't teach him everything he needs to know.",1318934959

These days I mostly work in python and erlang with a smattering of ocaml but learning haskell had a huge influence on the way I think about software.<p>I find it hard to articulate the ideas that I came away with. Something like 'code should be built out of small, composable abstractions that obey simple algebraic laws'. It's incredible how powerful this is in combination with pure code (which enables easier composition and algebraic reasoning), typeclasses (which make it easy to express the interface to an abstraction) and quickcheck/smallcheck (which make it easy to express and test the laws which the abstraction should obey).<p>Others have written about this more clearly than I ever could.

But here in Asia/India, a very VERY significant percentage of the total PC market is held by ""unbranded"" PCs - about 45% (ref: <a href=""http://trak.in/tags/business/2011/05/17/top-pc-compnies-india-growth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trak.in/tags/business/2011/05/17/top-pc-compnies-indi...</a> ).<p>This is so relevant to the Indian market that it is almost scary. As a yardstick -  for a fresh hire in India's largest tech employer, Infosys, buying a Macbook is almost 6 months salary. Buying an unbranded PC running Linux is about a month and a half salary.<p>Secondly, your assertion that motherboard sales wont be affected is wrong.

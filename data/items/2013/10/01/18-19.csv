I don&#x27;t seem to get those &quot;coders with families&quot; even applying to my jobs. Have they been scared off?<p>Is this happening because it is a small venture-backed startup, so crazy hours/dedication are implied? How do I shake that impression?<p>Is it a function of the skills requested? (1 Ruby data collection and 1 Rails)<p>I would much rather get those experienced coders that will want to work 40 hours. That&#x27;s plenty of time to get a ton done and if they don&#x27;t get enough accomplished in that time it&#x27;s probably my fault as the CTO.<p>Have you guys had any luck with certain methods to reach those guys specifically? I want to somehow express that it is ok to have work-life balance but not end up with lazy candidates. My co-founder and I will of course continue to work those 80+ hours but that makes sense because we are the founders.<p>Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",1380653985

You are emphasizing exactly the problem that is at the base of all current healthcare debacle - medical &quot;insurance&quot; is no longer an insurance - probably wasn&#x27;t for quite some time - it is a byzantinely complex system of payments for various services with wildly varied degrees of necessity, and significantly based on political considerations.<p>>>> You should also cover things that are preventative so that people don&#x27;t end up needing catastrophic coverage.<p>Some people <i>will</i> end up needing catastrophic coverage, that&#x27;s what it is for. But what you are saying people should not have a choice between buying <i>only</i> catastrophic coverage and managing other issues according to their current financial needs and abilities - possibly, yes, taking some limited risk on themselves - and buying comprehensive, but more expensive full-care all-included package. That would make it more expensive for those who were willing to take the risk, since this risk would be taken now by insurance company, and they will want to get paid for it, risk-shifting is never free.<p>>>> Paying for someone to see a therapist and take an anti-depressant is cheaper than paying for inpatient treatment if things spiral out of control.<p>Paying for car maintenance is cheaper than buying a new one. Yet nobody says car insurance should pay for routine car maintenance - those are different things, and people manage to take care of their cars just fine without car insurance paying for it. You&#x27;re again confusing healthcare and health insurance and seem to be under impression that the only way to administer healthcare is under the umbrella of all-encompassing &quot;insurance&quot; policy. My point is exactly that it is not true, and that ACA moving in this direction makes it more expensive, <i>especially</i> for people that otherwise would like to take a bit more risk than average person in order to allow them to profit later.

You have to monitor heap usage and GC pauses and keep manipulating heap size, perm gen size, heap usage that should initiate major GC (forget what variable this is) until you get things as smooth as possible and meet whatever resource constraints you want to meet on your hardware. In my experience, for large datasets ES really pushes the memory architecture of the JVM -- it doesn&#x27;t really perform too well when your heap size is like 30g.<p>After that, you&#x27;ll have to tune merging. The underlying Lucene storage engine chokes when it tries to merge segments that are large, so you have to tune the max segment sizes, etc.<p>Then, you&#x27;ll have to tune your queries -- it&#x27;s not feasible to do a full index scan on a large index so you have to get clever about how you pull data in chunks.

We&#x27;ve got a few projects in the pipeline that you can sink your teeth into right away:<p>Live Debugger\nYou&#x27;ll build a system that helps developers debug requests to the Segment.io API, and whether the request has been successfully routed to all its destinations. The fun part of this one is working at a variety of scale (isn&#x27;t it always?). You&#x27;ll have to build a system which helps devs debug on localhost, but also help them monitor production environments sending 500 requests a second.<p>MapReduce for All\nWe&#x27;d love to have a way for developers to query the terabytes of analytics data stored in the Segment.io data warehouse. Can you streamline the process until your mother can submit mapreduce queries with ease?<p>Data Export APIs\nPerhaps you&#x27;d like to build an API to export analytics data from Amazon S3 (or maybe even Glacier?).

We want you to become the world&#x27;s leading expert on mobile analytics, knowing the business models, industry, tools and problems inside and out.

Which parts of the product need the most love?&quot; You&#x27;ll be in charge of automating as much of that as possible without sacrificing quality.<p>Currently we get about 40 support requests per day. Here&#x27;s the breakdown:<p>35% are variations of &quot;thanks your product is super awesome!&quot; which are fun.\n25% are technical support requests for our main javascript library. You might have to jump on Skype with a Ukrainian developer or a Japanese designer (watch the timezone!) or maybe run down the street to help a local startup.\n15% are technical problems with our mobile libraries for iOS and Android.\n10% require debugging a server-side integration: Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, .NET, or Node.\n5% are completely confused, but we still <3 them.\nand the remaining 10% are hiring, sales and other random inquiries.\nThis kind of analysis should feel natural to you!<p>Your analysis of support issues, feature requests, and customer feedback will be absolutely critical to planning tasks with the rest of the team.

So show me you&#x27;ve tried something and it works, I&#x27;ll collect the details, and over time and hundreds of experiments, we can start to draw some correlations. A few stories and an upcoming book ain&#x27;t going to cut it.<p>What I&#x27;m seeing in the tech community is this rise of, for lack of a better term, dimestore pundits. Some guy gets a big contract for XCorp, tries working with people dressed up like chickens. Now he has a website and a book on how we&#x27;re all supposed to dress up like chickens when we work.<p>It&#x27;s always been like this -- the folks with the megaphones drowning out the folks who plod along trying to spot patterns and share stories without becoming dogmatic. But lately people are climbing on this bandwagon where in order to grow, you should be teaching something. So hell, everybody with a keyboard is now a teacher. That&#x27;s not a recipe for helping folks, that&#x27;s a recipe for generating widespread cynicism.<p>I wish the 37Signals the best of luck in these marketing efforts. I understand they&#x27;re quite awesome. I just get tired of being baited with half-assed conjecture sitting on top of a few anecdotes. Things have changed. The world moves on. We&#x27;re the tech community. We get that. So show me the startups that are changing the world with remote teams. Show me the consulting companies that are killing the competition by using distributed teams. Show me the companies that are clamoring for distributed and remote teams because they&#x27;re finding them so efficient. Show me a bunch of data. Then you can wave your hands around and we can all have a nice sing-a-long about the brave new world we&#x27;re headed into. Otherwise it&#x27;s just self-gratifying noise.</rant>",1380651802

You can link other people to it, for example. &quot;Oh yeah, that&#x27;s a bug, here&#x27;s the bug report [link]&quot;<p>- Developers responsible discuss the bug in said bug tracking software.<p>- Someone eventually marks some kind of disposition on the bug &quot;can&#x27;t replicate&quot;, &quot;won&#x27;t fix&quot;, &quot;fixed&quot;, etc. Bonus points if they can give some rough estimate on fix availability &quot;should be available in next week&#x27;s build&quot;, for example.<p>here&#x27;s how the Apple process works:<p>- You file the bug in a private bug tracker. This bug report is only visible to you (and Apple), so you can&#x27;t link it. When users report bugs in forums the only solution is &quot;I filed it already, but I can&#x27;t link to you, you should file it again&quot;. In fact Apple <i>encourages</i> the repeated filing of the same bugs as a &quot;vote&quot; mechanism.<p>- Apple never contacts you, or anyone else, about said bug unless they specifically need help tracking it down. This is rare.<p>- There is no word on the disposition of the bug in any case. If it&#x27;s fixed, you don&#x27;t hear about it. If they&#x27;re passing on the bug, you don&#x27;t hear about it. If it&#x27;s not-really-a-bug, you don&#x27;t hear about it. The only way for you to know if your bug got fixed is to download each new release and try to repro the bug for yourself.<p>So sure, Apple certainly does fix bugs, but the way they handle bug reports and resolution makes them one of the worst companies to work with from a bug reporting and triage perspective.<p>[edit] Not to mention that fairly major bugs go unfixed for a very long time. If you have a iOS7 device give this a go: go to Calendar (yes, that first-party built-in app), create a new event. Type in a long description - one that exceeds the size of the textbox. Your text now overflows without scrolling and just disappears off the edge of the control. Oops.<p>This bug existed all the way from iOS7 beta 1. Naturally, something this basic was reported constantly on the forums, with the requisite multi-page bitch-fest from devs. People filed bug reports on this, but as usual there was never any feedback from Apple. So beta 2 came along and it wasn&#x27;t fixed, but people kept supposing they&#x27;d fix in the next one. Then the next one. Then the next one.<p>And here we are, iOS 7.0.2 and it&#x27;s still not fixed.<p>Apple isn&#x27;t exactly known for being very on top of their bug-fixing game.",1380651273

(We use cisco webex, does anyone know an open alternative?)<p>For larger meetings we&#x27;ve been experimenting with videoconferencing between meeting rooms in different cities. Since being on video is annoying, maybe this would be an alternative to stand-up meetings? (I&#x27;m pretty sure whatever we use for this is proprietary as well, what&#x27;s a good open alternative?)<p>The point of many Agile practices is to increase communication. How can you best capture the ease of walking 2 cubes over to have a chat with your coworker? If everyone&#x27;s remote you don&#x27;t have as good a natural indication of how busy or available everyone is. If you build something to provide that indication, the boss can monitor it and it will stop working right.<p>If people are talking in the next cube over, I can ignore it or jump in if I hear something interesting or that I can help with. But in some cases the discussions are things that wouldn&#x27;t be discussed where certain other people might be able to overhear. How do you capture when communications should be <i>available</i> to some part of the group without interrupting them (so no acknowledgement needed from the recipient), but hidden from some other part of the group? And without requiring the people initiating the communications to explicitly bother to set this up? This is naturally baked in to physical-world interactions, is it useful enough to try to duplicate?<p>I&#x27;ve heard suggestions of a &quot;virtual office&quot; for voice chat, where you have a grid layout with cubes or conference rooms or whatnot and people have locations on that grid and can hear eachother (or not) based on how close they are. Is there anything that actually does this? Is it useful (or if it doesn&#x27;t exist, would it be useful to have or is it just gimmicky)?<p>From what I understand, electronic text-based communications tend to be archived for a long time for legal reasons. How far does this apply to voice communications, and does VoIP vs telephones make a difference? How far does this affect what is or isn&#x27;t said? I know at work, some conversations only happen in person or over the phone rather than IM or email. How important is this effect, and how does it impact getting work done?",1380650549

What the author forgot is to take by far the most important variable into account: <i>SPEED</i><p>So let&#x27;s quote the author:<p>&quot;The important fact: there is a limit to the number of cars that can pass by a given point on the highway in a given amount of time, and that limit is one car every 2 seconds, per lane. So imagine you are in heavy traffic during rush hour. There are a certain number of cars in line in front of you. Lets pick a point on the road to call the front of the line  say, the point at which you plan to exit the highway. The line gets shorter by one car every 2 seconds. If there are 1,000 cars in front of you, its going to take a minimum of 2,000 seconds for you to get to the front of the line. It doesnt matter whether people are kind and let cars merge in front of them, zipper-style. It doesnt matter how much stop-and-go there is. The simple fact is that it takes 2 seconds per car for you to get to the front of the line, and there are some cars in front of you that have to get there before you do.&quot;<p>Ok this is correct. BUT: I don&#x27;t care if it takes me 2,000s if my exit is 44 miles away (80mph) but I do if my exit is 10miles away.<p>So you drive along at 80mph and there is cars around you everywhere. Do you care? No, you&#x27;re covering distance. It&#x27;s the same as if you were all by yourself on the highway. The distance between cars is absolutely irrelevant and so is the time between cars if you still go 80mph. Nobody would call it a traffic jam.<p>Next quote:<p>&quot;Leaving space in front of your car for people who are trying to merge wont solve anything.&quot;<p>Yes it absolutely does. And it again solves one very very important piece of a traffic jam: Average speed. Leaving space is crucial. It allows people to do two things:<p>- Accelerate<p>- Not having to brake<p>These two are crucial to get speed up and thus resolve traffic jams. Incidentally he linked an article which visualizes exactly this:<p><a href=""http://www.smartmotorist.com/traffic-and-safety-guideline/traffic-jams.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smartmotorist.com/traffic-and-safety-guideline/tr...</a><p>(Section: Merging-lane Traffic Jams, A Simple Cure)<p>You can see on the right side how his &quot;cars per second&quot; is _exactly the same_ than on the left side. Yet, everybody will be much happier on the right side. Why? Because the speed&#x27;s been increased and people in the cars cover ground.<p>Next quote:<p>&quot;Suppose youre on a 2-lane (each way) highway and one lane is closed up ahead due to construction. Now the flow rate of your lane is cut in half (or there are twice as many cars in line in front of you, depending on how you want to look at it). Road signs commonly ask you to use both lanes up to the point of the bottleneck. Thats reasonable advice, but its not going to get anyone home faster&quot;<p>Yes it absolutely does. Why? We are all programmers here so let&#x27;s talk in our lingo: This is our API. Our interface that we agree on. <i>If</i> people follow the interface (rule), <i>then</i> we have people agree on it and we are predictable and prevent braking. This is exactly what we want. Increase speed (with gaps), prevent breaking, be predicable. No surprising cars merging means no breaking and thus increase in average speed which in turn means no more traffic jam.<p>Please, disregard this article. The conclusions are wrong, the assumptions are wrong and the deductions and the terrible advice he gives at the end is wrong.",1380650494

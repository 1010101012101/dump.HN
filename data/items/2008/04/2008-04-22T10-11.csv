Yesterday, I got modded down to -7 for suggesting that a company like 37signals isn't a startup.<p>A startup is a business whose primary aim is growth. If you focus on revenue, you do so at the expense of growth, because people prefer free stuff over non-free stuff.<p>Could someone explain to me why I'm wrong? (I am not saying this rhetorically, by the way. If we assume that this community is as smart as everyone says it is, then I must be wrong.)",1208860475

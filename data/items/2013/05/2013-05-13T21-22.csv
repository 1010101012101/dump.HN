I mean that, generally <i>everyone</i> is lonely in the way Fromm-Reichmann is saying, but because it at a socially-acceptable level, then it looks normal.<p>For example, I've been at parties and places where friends ""hang out"". No one really talks about much. No one is really engaging in anything. The jokes people are saying are not there to connect with someone, and more to fill the air with something to say.<p>This is in contrast with, say, you go to this party, and on an off chance, you start talking with someone. And it feels like a very different experience, like you are fully connecting. You're no longer waiting for the other person to shut up so you can say something. The conversation flows, but the content doesn't really matter. It could be a deep discussion about math or philosophy; it could be sharing some life stories; it could be swapping some of your wild, youthful adventures.<p>You're not going to be able to measure presence of mind. But you know when you are present vs. when you are not.",1368482272

(Will the compiler figure this out? Maybe, maybe not. But if you write the code you want - which in this case you might as well, since the transformation is simple - then you won't have to worry about that. As a general point of principle you should write the code you want, rather than something else that you hope will become the code you have in mind; computers are very bad at figuring out intent, but excellent at simply following instructions.)<p>What are the other bogus suggestions? The overall thrust of the slides seems to me valid: know what's expensive (branches, memory access, mini-pitfalls like the micrododed thing), pick a strategy that avoids all of that, and don't throw away performance. Performance always ends up being an issue; you don't have to carefully preserve every last cycle, but that's no excuse for just pissing away cycles doing pointless stuff.<p>Not explicitly stated, but apparent from comparing the suggested approach to the original one, is that you can't always just leave this stuff to the last minute, when you've had the profiler tell you what's a bottleneck and what isn't. The requisite changes might have far-reaching consequences, and so it's worth giving a bit of thought to performance matters when you start and things are a bit more in flux.<p>A bit of domain knowledge also won't hurt.

Almost everyone who has ever thought about heritability has reached a commonsense intuition about it: One way or another, heritability has to be some kind of index of how genetic a trait is. That intuition explains why so many thousands of heritability coefficients have been calculated over the years. Once the twin registries have been assembled, it's easy and fun, like having a genoscope you can point at one trait after another to take a reading of how genetic things are. Height? Very genetic. Intelligence? Pretty genetic. Schizophrenia? That looks pretty genetic too. Personality? Yep, that too. And over multiple studies and traits the heritabilities go up and down, providing the basis for nearly infinite Talmudic revisions of the grand theories of the heritability of things, perfect grist for the wheels of social science.<p>""Unfortunately, that fundamental intuition is wrong. Heritability isn an index of how genetic a trait is. A great deal of time has been wasted in the effort of measuring the heritability of traits in the false expectation that somehow the genetic nature of psychological phenomena would be revealed. There are many reasons for making this strong statement, but the most important of them harkens back to the description of heritability as an effect size. An effect size of the R2 family is a standardized estimate of the proportion of the variance in one variable that is reduced when another variable is held constant statistically. In this case it is an estimate of how much the variance of a trait would be reduced if everyone were genetically identical. With a moment's thought you can see that the answer to the question of how much variance would be reduced if everyone was genetically identical depends crucially on how genetically different everyone was in the first place.""<p>Johnson, Wendy; Turkheimer, Eric; Gottesman, Irving I.; Bouchard Jr., Thomas (2009).

For example, height is on the order of 90% heritable, yet North and South Koreans, who come from the same genetic background, presently differ in average height by a full 6 inches (Pak, 2004; Schwekendiek, 2008).""<p>The review article ""The neuroscience of human intelligence differences"" by Deary and Johnson and Penke (2010) relates specifically to human intelligence:<p><a href=""http://www.larspenke.eu/pdfs/Deary_Penke_Johnson_2010_-_Neuroscience_of_intelligence_review.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.larspenke.eu/pdfs/Deary_Penke_Johnson_2010_-_Neur...</a><p>""At this point, it seems unlikely that single genetic loci have major effects on normal-range intelligence.

""Our target article was intended to provide background knowledge to psychologists and other social scientists on the subject of heritability. This statistic, in many ways so basic, is both extremely powerful in revealing the presence of genetic inuence and very weak in providing much information beyond this. Many forms of measurement error, statistical artefact, violation of underlying assumptions, geneenvironment interplay, epigenetic mechanisms and no doubt processes we have not yet even identied can contribute to the magnitudes of heritability estimates. If psychologists and other social scientists want to understand genetic involvement in behavioural traits, we believe that it is going to be necessary to distinguish among these possibilities to at least some degree. Heritability estimates alone are not going to help us do this.""<p>Turkheimer, E. (2011). Genetics and human agency (Commentary on Dar-Nimrod & Heine, 2011). Psychological Bulletin, 137, 825-828.

""That heritability depends on the population in which it is measured is one of the most frequently repeated caveats in the social sciences, but it is nevertheless often forgotten in the breach. (For example, it is nearly meaningless for Dar-Nimrod and Heine to note that 'heritability [of intelligence is] typically estimated to range from .50 to .85' [p. 805]. The heritability of intelligence isnt anything, and even placing it in a range is misleading. Making a numerical point estimate of the heritability of intelligence is akin to saying, 'Social psychologists usually estimate the F ratio for the fundamental attribution error to be between 2.0 and 4.0.') The observation that genotypic variation accounts for 90% of the variation in height in the modern world depends on the variability of genotype and environment relevant to height. Among cloned animals with widely varying diets, body size is perfectly environmental with heritability of 0; in genetically variable animals raised in identical environments heritability is 1.0. This is no mere statistical fine point: it means that the entire project of assessing how essentially genetic traits are in terms of measured heritability coefficients is a fools errand.""<p>The full text of the articles at the links, which in some cases focus on IQ and in other cases are more general, will give you more background in the methods and reasoning used by researchers on the topic of human behavioral genetics.",1368481063

Everybody gets lonely sometimes. I would call <i>not having skills to handle loneliness</i> lethal.<p>My starting point for combating loneliness is to start by looking inward -- What skills can I develop, how am I holding myself back -- before looking outward, like what resources are out there. Family, hobbies, travel, sites to connect with others... they all help only if I know how to interact. If I don't, they may make me feel <i>more</i> lonely. By contrast, if I know how to interact and attract people to me, those external resources work without intentional effort.<p>I wrote up my social skills exercises -- <a href=""http://joshuaspodek.com/communication-skills-exercises-6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joshuaspodek.com/communication-skills-exercises-6</a> -- as a resource for other geeky people to use because I think they'll help others like they helped me.

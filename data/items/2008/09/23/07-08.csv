A commodity (in this context) is something that can be purchased from any vendor with very little preference from buyers. Price becomes the only differentiators.<p>The core has always been printing, not content creation. Actually, what is killing newspapers is that most of what they do/did was either a monopolised commodity tied up with printing or simply no longer necessary. What previously made a newspaper a newspaper?<p><i>Classifieds/Notifications</i> They were the only ones that had the ability to make new information available. They competed with each other locally for a piece of this goldmine. Monopoly gone <i>and</i> now unnecessary.<p><i>News Aggregation</i> - Come on. How much of what papers print is printing & delivering what other papers/wires/independent journalists wrote. Well, we don't need them for that anymore.<p><i>""Analysis""</i> - As far as commenting & analysing all that aggregated info, well they can still do that. But you need to compete with professors, grandmas, retired politicians & anyone else with access to Wordpress, an endless sea of them. You need to be very good & papers certainly don't have a monopoly on quality.<p><i>distribution & printing</i> - No longer necessary.<p>What do they do that isn't like that (no longer necessary part of a monopoly)? Their representatives like to point to investigative journalism (first hand research & fact finding) & community binding (everyone reads the same paper). The latter we can do without, the former is a commodity, of sorts. Actually, not always, but doesn't justify the whole shebang - sorry.<p>Bottom line is that 1. online ads aren't worth as much, 2. classifieds no longer belong to them, 3. we don't need them to print paper & deliver it to us & 4. they have competition for content creation. Tough bananas.",1222156704

And I found that Linux had more of everything that I loved about the Amiga: Community, great independent software developers producing innovative and strange things, a culture of teaching and learning, and a focus on openness and interoperability (ARexx was slick).  So, I haven't really looked back (much), but I certainly learned a lot and had a lot of fun with my Amigas.  But I don't feel like the world is really missing anything these days by the lack of a mainstream Amiga product...for a few years in the 90's I occasionally wish for stuff I'd used on my Amiga (the IRC and email clients I used, for example, were awesome and it took years for me to be as happy with alternatives on Linux or Windows).",1222156385

Smaller and lesser known developers would have been afraid of the consequences of possibly being blacklisted/banned/rejected. There would be an uproar bigger than all the collective previous backlash (i am rich, netshare, podcaster, mailwrangler etc.) if Wil Shipley or his products were, and I doubt Apple would be that foolish...<p>I really would have liked to cut Apple some slack because the app store is sort of new, but some of the stuff happening right now is making even the more well known iPhone developers nervous/unhappy/outright pissed off/unwilling to work on any more iPhone applications. Besides, Shipley is right on target in everything he mentions. I'm sitting on a couple applications and ideas just because I know they would be rejected by the app store morality police. Oh well.",1222154314

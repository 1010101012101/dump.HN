I think people don't appreciate how productive Apple is on a per-engineer basis.""<p>The thing is that's not quite right. The comparison there is between the crew maintaining file system support versus the crew implementing a new fs from scratch. The Author pays lip service in saying it normally takes more than one OS release to implement a FS, but still underestimates the effort it takes to make a completely new production ready FS.<p>Yes ZFS is not the be all end all. BtrFS, distributed FS's like Hammer and Venti, as well as the occasional complaint about ZFS are exhibits A-? for that, but that doesn't mean Apple can create an FS of the same sophistication in the 18? months that they release in.",1256468292

Just because someone has access to this information 10 milliseconds earlier doesn't make it ""insider"" info.

When your H1-B expires, they'll have you work elsewhere until you're eligible for an H1-B again. This is based on a small sample (rumors).",1256467429

901478,comment,901101,901189,0,0,caffeine,,,"The biggest barrier for beginners is usually getting an environment working that is transparent, to allow you to get to grips with the actual programming ideas (which, in the beginning, are relatively simple).<p>For that reason, you might consider playing around with JavaScript, where the effects of your changes are just a ""refresh"" away. Get hold of jQuery and play with the tutorials, maybe. (Install Firebug so you can see what's going on in your code)<p>Javascript can actually be a real app since you can store information in an SQL database on the client (in the latest browsers).  My first iPhone app was actually a JavaScript page that stores data in SQLite, and uses a CSS template to look just like a native app (it's a Hacker's Diet implementation).<p>But fnid is right: fundamentally, you need a problem to solve.  It's most fun if you implement something that is directly useful to you.",1256467017

Customers demand that their systems are written in a language that they feel confident they can, in a pinch, take over and hire programmers to fix.  They believe they can do that for C++, they don't know anything about anything else.<p>We also have to put code in escrow for this very reasons. We have to provide a package that can be put on a stock piece of hardware and then build the deliverable.  Then the auditor checks that the code ""looks reasonable,"" at which point the repository is put on some external device and locked in a safe.<p>They believe that if it's in a language they've heard of, and have heard is popular, then they can go out and hire programmers to work on the code if they ever have reason to do so.",1256465954

It's not that he and other high-profile CEOs aren't honest, it's that they are hyper-aware of their words and are most comfortable sharing thoughts they have already had, the particular talking points that they know are ok to repeat in public.

My dad, highly numerate, a car enthusiast, and a pretty good financial optimizer, had one response:<p>Just buy a car you can afford.<p>What he meant was that I should negotiate the purchase price and then write a check. No games. If I felt uncomfortable paying a price, I needed a cheaper car, not a different strategy for buying it.<p>Good advice, I thought. I suspect it applies to travel, too.",1452877198

In practice SIMs with completely made-up IMSIs are even commercially available (idea there is that some phones will not fully boot without SIM).",1452877151

It&#x27;s the political structure around Bitcoin that appear to be killing it.<p>Fixing Bitcoin would be the best solution, but the politics and governance structure aren&#x27;t letting this happen. Aside: As I age I&#x27;m understanding more and more how critical leadership is. All of the pieces are there for Bitcoin to succeed, but they aren&#x27;t organized correctly.<p>The second option is the community choosing to change to a different client, so that by a grassroots movement, eventually the blockchain moved in the right direction. It would likely be a rough transition for uneducated people, companies, and software for businesses that use Bitcoin, but if it can&#x27;t be official, it would have to be something done similarly to XT.<p>The last solution is to switch to another cryptocoin and blockchain entirely. I don&#x27;t keep up with news, so hopefully some of the smaller coins have implemented fixes. This would set back blockchain-based cryptocurrency a few years, though. If the whole community abandoned Bitcoin and moved to Vertcoin or Dogecoin, companies that went out of their way to support Bitcoin might be reluctant to follow.",1452877132

So for every extra $£€ you make, you can give yourself a short-term dopamine hit at the expense of long-term planning.<p>This is true to some extent, but if I don&#x27;t minimally optimize my spending it makes me guilty, not happy. I feel I would be giving the wrong signal if my money went to goods/services optimized for my cognitive biases rather than for actual utility (or estimated utility). The duty of voting responsibly with your money does not go away when you get richer, in fact it even tends to increase.<p>I also disagree with the notion that spending less means resisting the temptation to buy more things, or to settle for things that are worse than the best. It depends a lot on what you want. If you don&#x27;t even think that you could be spending more, if you have a minimalist lifestyle and no expensive tastes, I find it can be quite natural and not at all frustrating to spend less than what you earn, even if you&#x27;re not deliberately trying to save money.",1452877049

10910468,comment,10909454,10909454,0,0,JackC,,,"One thing I&#x27;d like to better understand about cMix is the practical implications for flow analysis attacks (watching who participates in each round and trying to correlate senders and receivers based on participation in the same rounds).<p>cMix seems to accept more likelihood of a worst-case adversary in order to maximize efficiency. For example, the paper says: &quot;Another notable difference between cMix and most previous mixnets is that each mix node knows all senders. This difference does not weaken the adversarial model because the adversary is expected to know all participants of the mixing round, and in cMix the unlinkability between a sender and a receiver is still ensured, by even any one uncorrupted mix node. On the other hand, this can empower cMix nodes to perform other tasks such as end-to-end secure messaging without introducing a public-key infrastructure of the participants.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s true that <i>in theory</i> mixnets are often modeled by assuming a perfect adversary who sees every message enter and exit the net and can perfectly match it to an ongoing participant over time. But I believe that they don&#x27;t claim to offer perfect protection against such an adversary, and in practice benefit from mostly not having to. It seems like cMix makes it easy for a compromised Network Handler, or maybe any one compromised mix node(?), to serve as that perfect adversary.<p>So ... does the design of cMix make it more likely that, in practice, it will have to actually face a worst-case adversary that most mix networks don&#x27;t have to face?",1452876978

This was the important reason for them, and everyone, to escape SourceForge.<p>I mean, if you are honest about it: I can copy all my primary data off Facebook. I know how to do that. You know how to do that as well. But you know what I get when I do that? A copy. I will never escape Facebook without horribly devaluing my own content.<p>Is that the correct decision for friends-only stuff about me? Sure, as that content doesn&#x27;t get publicly linked anyway. For my local political movement? Probably, because that content gets dated quickly and my consumers are effectively being advertised to.<p>Is it the correct decision for a project I expect to be relevant in 20 years? No. I find myself reading things from old mailing lists and issue trackers constantly. Open source projects that have been able to keep a coherent history of their project around long enough that hyperlinks to their issues and posts continue to work 10 or even 20 years later is super important.<p>GitHub is at the top of their game right now. But they honestly add way way way less value than either Sourceforge or Google Code did. Mostly they trick people into using git as if it was Subversion (git isn&#x27;t really designed to ever have two people pushing to the same repository on a common basis) and then &quot;solving&quot; the problem they created (by providing an account manager). They don&#x27;t even model git networks correctly and require the fork chain to be some silly explicit tree.<p>Something is going to come with a good issue tracker that scales to public projects and provides valuable code analysis, and all the really large projects are going to switch. Maybe GitHub will finally decide to solve these problems (though the quick response I saw to that &quot;open letter&quot; yesterday makes me doubtful), but then there will be more problems. Maybe in 20 years git will feel as dumb to people as Subversion, as I remember when Subversion was insanely awesome ;P.<p>If GitHub had a &quot;bring your own domain&quot; option, and preferably some kind of URL router mechanism (for someone migrating from a previous solution) it would look a lot less weird to do important things on GitHub, but otherwise, being able to make a copy of your data is a red herring... of course you can make a copy: no programmer would ever question that :/.",1452876973

10910465,comment,10909886,10909886,0,0,AndrewKemendo,,,"Back in 2009 when I was getting into bitcoin, it was widely described as a &quot;stateless currency&quot; and not just an alternative to Visa or credit cards. Having a background in economics, bitcoin looked to me like a truly revolutionary technology and if it was adopted en masse would change politics forever.<p>The problem however is that a nation&#x27;s currency is arguably the primary source of it&#x27;s sovereignty. Whomever controls the currency primarily used in a nation, controls the nation. So it&#x27;s safe to say that no nation is going to let bitcoin or any other currency take hold for widespread commercial use in lieu of it&#x27;s sovereign currency - that&#x27;s a hallmark of a failed state.<p>In fact that&#x27;s why when regulators declared bitcoin as a commodity it was such a big deal. The US doesn&#x27;t really care because we haven&#x27;t had commodity money since the 1970s, but the idea that if enough people decided that they wanted commodity money, they would arguably have a medium with which to do it with that wasn&#x27;t tied to any state.<p>So as with every product, unless a massive number of people decide to stop using their home currency and start using bitcoin, then bitcoin will &quot;fail.&quot;<p>Whether it pivots to some kind of credit system or not is largely immaterial because of the potential it had.<p>It&#x27;s like if we created Artificial General Intelligence and it decided to just write movie reviews forever.",1452876965

Here are the camps I am seeing:<p>Hearn seems to be saying that Bitcoin right now is <i>not</i>  really decentralized - aka the Chinese firewall problem and so much power already centralized in a few peoples hands.  He also seems to be saying that the motivations for Bitcoin Core developers are not based on good faith technical disagreements, but more about bad faith political disagreements.<p>Fred Wilson seems to be saying that he concurs with Hearn&#x27;s concerns about Bitcoin already being centralized, but would characterize Bitcoin Core developers as having <i>good</i> faith political disagreements and advocates for &quot;hard fork(s)&quot; as a way to resolve these <i>good</i> faith political disagreements.<p>You seem to be saying that, in fact, BitCoin Core developers have good faith technical reasons - nay - <i>empirically validated reasons</i> to believe BitCoin has no real choice and that it can not ever become a visa-like transactional currency without destroying the decentralization qualities that make it so interesting.  I assume you also believe that Hearn&#x27;s qualms about the current centralization are wrong in some way.<p>So that makes for very conflicting stories about what is going on for this outsider to have any hope of judging.  Very interesting though.<p>Can you tell me why the decentralized ledger can&#x27;t just be made more granular so that increasing the block size might make kick out current under-powered nodes, but those nodes could be turned into virtual nodes where under-powered machines could pool resources to establish a virtual node and thus maintain decentralization?",1452876646

It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, except where those with capital can use it to bias the system in their favour.<p>An example is access to education. In the US, the lowest ability quartile of high earners now has a better chance of graduating collage than the highest ability quartile of low earners. From memory it was something like 31% to 29% respectively. The real shame there is the 71% of high-ability low-wealth kids who can&#x27;t graduate college but really should.

Why? Because all properties we care about (availability, uncensorability, unseizability, etc.) derive from decentralization[0]. And at the end of the day we can do everything Bitcoin does faster, better, and cheaper on some alternative consensus system (see: Stellar, Open-Transactions, Liquid) that does not have this decentralization property. Decentralization is <i>expensive</i>. It requires a dynamic membership, multi-party block signing algorithm, which at the moment means proof of work. And proof of work costs hundreds of millions of dollars per year to maintain, and throttles the available bandwidth due to the adversarial assumption and the existence of selfish mining[1].<p>The question is not whether Bitcoin <i>should be</i> a store of value or a medium of exchange. That implies we have some choice in the matter. The question is what level of on-chain utility does Bitcoin actually support under untrusted, adversarial conditions, without losing all properties derived from decentralization. This is an empirical question. The available bandwidth is something that can be determined from the performance of the code in the real world extrapolated to various adversarial simulations.<p>We had two Scaling Bitcoin workshops last year that gave us a data-driven answer: 3-4MB per block, tops. There are potentially ways that this number can be improved (see: weak blocks), and those are being worked on but are still some time from showing results. There are also some assumptions underlying this number, e.g. that we change the validation cost metric, which none of the existing proposals do in a smart way. But the scientific process is telling us right now that with the tools available to us we can increase the worst-case block size to 3-4MB with a better metric without the decentralization story becoming unacceptably worse off.<p>That is the plan of Bitcoin Core. The deployment of segregated witness will allow up to 2MB blocks under typical conditions, and 3-4MB under worst-case adversarial conditions. It will exhaust the available capacity for growth in the Bitcoin network at this time. Meanwhile, work progresses on IBLT, weak blocks, Bitcoin-NG, fraud proofs and probabilistic validation, and other related technologies that might provide an answer for the next increase a year or two later. I&#x27;m hopeful we may even be able to get an order of magnitude improvement from that one, but we&#x27;ll see.<p>No one I&#x27;m aware of is pushing for smaller blocks because Bitcoin <i>should be</i> a store of value and a settlement layer. If I had magic pixie dust I&#x27;d want 1GB blocks and everything on-chain too. But we live in the real world and are stuck in a situation where Bitcoin loses all of its unique properties if we scale much further than where we are at now. And so we must ask the question: what will Bitcoin become, since it can&#x27;t scale on-chain? How can we live with that outcome? The idea of a settlement layer and off-chain but trustless payment networks like Lightning naturally arise from that thinking. The Lightning Network[2] is a way that we can have our cake and eat it too: Bitcoin remains small and decentralized, but everyone still has access to bitcoin payments. Lightning can potentially scale to global usage with a small-block chain as the settlement layer.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://bluematt.bitcoin.ninja/2015/01/14/decentralization/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bluematt.bitcoin.ninja/2015/01/14/decentralization/</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://hackingdistributed.com/2013/11/04/bitcoin-is-broken/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackingdistributed.com/2013/11/04/bitcoin-is-broken/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://lightning.network/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lightning.network/</a>",1452875772

And they need to meet their general operating costs - office space and staff - not just for the workshops but as an organization. They&#x27;ve written about their finances: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/n39/why_cfar_the_view_from_2015/#finances"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/n39/why_cfar_the_view_from_2015/#fin...</a> (you might also find the rest of that interesting).<p>2. Justified for them to charge, certainly. Worthwhile for me to pay, I think so.<p>3. Difficult to say, partly because I don&#x27;t have strong memories of what I was like before attending. I think that post-CFAR, I&#x27;m generally happier, more likely to try new things, better at making phone calls. I expect other changes too. But I can&#x27;t say that these are definitely attributed to CFAR.<p>It&#x27;s also difficult because I don&#x27;t often explicitly use the techniques they teach, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t use them. E.g. about six months ago I went mostly-vegetarian. I realized that for the most part, I&#x27;m just as happy without meat as with it, but there are exceptions. So I let myself have those exceptions, and get almost all the benefits of vegetarianism with few of the costs. This was a form of goal factoring, and I don&#x27;t know if I would have done it without CFAR. But I didn&#x27;t sit down and think &quot;okay, I&#x27;m going to goal factor this&quot;.<p>4. I&#x27;m not sure. This was too long ago, and I don&#x27;t think I saw him super-often around that time period.<p>5. I suspect most of the specific techniques can be found elsewhere in one form or another. They run tests to try to find the best way to teach the techniques. There&#x27;s also value in curation, and in having someone there to help dubug and adapt to circumstances. (&quot;You suggest committing to a specific time to do this, but I&#x27;m reluctant because my social life is pretty unpredictable.&quot; &quot;Sure, maybe try picking a time, but giving yourself permission to change it, maybe up to three times.&quot;)<p>But what they&#x27;re trying to teach isn&#x27;t really techniques. This won&#x27;t do it justice, but it&#x27;s closer to: they&#x27;re trying to teach the mindset that lets you generate the techniques. That lets you say, &quot;okay, here&#x27;s a problem. Let&#x27;s try to solve it. Is this solution going to work? No. Okay, what could I do that would actually work?&quot; and to come up with answers.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any other resources trying to teach that.<p>6. They have an alumni mailing list, but CFAR doesn&#x27;t post to it much as an organization. They sometimes ask for volunteers to help out at workshops, or if someone can help them scope out venues, or for beta testers for classes they&#x27;re working on. Outside that, I don&#x27;t receive anything from them (except automated thank-you emails when I donate).<p>7. Not at all. Some of it came up during conversations, either naturally or deliberately as something I chose for comfort zone expansion. There was also a session of &quot;againstness training&quot;, which was even more optional than everything else, in which Valentine deliberately asked me uncomfortable questions so I could practice being in a super-uncomfortable state.<p>When I said about personal stuff, I just meant that - for example, if one thing I&#x27;d got from CFAR had been &quot;I realized I could come out to my closest friends, but probably not my family&quot;, then I wasn&#x27;t going to make that public knowledge.

I guess the swiss fee is there for the same reason and is not there to allow people to get the majority of their media for no additional money.

Online backup is good too but for quicker or more frequent access, a NAS fills the gap nicely.<p>The other big storage hog is security cam video.  There are occasional reports of burglaries in my neighborhood and sometimes I just like to know if a package was ever dropped off or someone bumped the car while parallel parking.  So I picked up a couple of inexpensive IP cameras and rather than shelling out monthly for some unreliable and potentially insecure &quot;cloud&quot; storage plan, I use Synology&#x27;s Surveillance Station IP cam software to manage recording, playback, and storage of camera footage.  The amount of space on the NAS means I can easily keep a week or more worth of recordings from both cameras and with the actual NAS being stashed away out of easy view, it&#x27;s unlikely to be stolen in the event of a burglary.

Anti-cancer drugs are often severely toxic; even the new spate of immunocentric therapies proved highly dangerous when first administered.  Several early recipients died due to clueless drug administration protocols.  THAT&#x27;s the reason we have Phase I.  Humans usually respond differently to a drug than the animals who have gone before.<p>That said, I think the FDA <i>should</i> approach cancer differently than other diseases, probably by establishing a new experimental model entirely (eliminating the Phase I/II/III system).  Given that canger drugs and patients and protocols must ALWAYS be administered sensitively, circumstantially, and adaptively, the current 3 phase system seems to be serving cancer patients poorly, locking them into ineffective treatments for too long, based on too much emphasis on inflexible trial policy.  Experimental protocols that are more adaptive and personalized are needed.  Of course, this will be very hard technically and insanely expensive clinically.<p>How to begin this?

But an announcement of a laboratory result in cultured cell lines or in mice or some other preliminary model is a LONG way from a demonstration of safety and effectiveness for a new treatment of a human disease. Let&#x27;s keep funding and celebrating basic research, and let&#x27;s keep advancing the frontier in clinical trials on human patients, but let&#x27;s reality-check every step of the way to make sure that proposed new treatments really do good, and really do more good than harm.<p>For perspective on this, it&#x27;s important to note that age-adjusted all-cause mortality has been steadily going DOWN all over the world. Life expectancy at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages is still rising throughout both the developed countries and the still developing countries of the world.[1] Right now, the number-one thing we can do to reduce our own risk of disability or death is to take action on known individual preventive measures that raise likelihood of good health and to set up institutional incentives for doctors and other practitioners to use best-practice means of preventing and treating disease. Steady incremental improvements of many kinds are increasing healthy human lifespan all over the world at all ages.[2]<p>[1] &quot;The Biodemography of Human Ageing&quot; by James Vaupel<p><a href=""http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2860ef54d218ce5ce19abe6a59/dc_biodemography_of_human_ageing_nature_2010_vaupel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_longevity/2013/09/life_expectancy_history_public_health_and_medical_advances_that_lead_to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_...</a>",1452874232

I purchased a new mattress, and couldn&#x27;t fit the boxspring in it. The delivery guys took the boxspring back, and got me a boxspring that comes in two pieces, called a &quot;split boxspring&quot;. It&#x27;s basically two twin boxsprings that you put side by side.

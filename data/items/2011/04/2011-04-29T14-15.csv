While the framework makes it easier to leverage these features(you can still use it with non-managed C++ but it's quite annoying to get working), the Windows kernel is what allows the multiple versions to exist.<p>In the case of .NET, it's the side-by-side deployment of the .NET runtimes that allow multiple versions to be present on the system at the same time.",1304089193

Research on new drugs is a multibillion dollar industry in several different countries. But there is a dearth of well statistically controlled studies of the safety and effectiveness of LSD for any purpose. Indeed, medical research more often pursues the issue of how to help emergency room patients who appear for treatment of psychotic symptoms triggered by illicit use of LSD.<p>On the specific issue of programmer or scientist creativity and productivity, that too is a much researched field, but again there are not well controlled studies showing that anyone increases productivity or creativity in any occupation while using LSD. The checkered academic career of Timothy Leary is instructive in this regard. What research shows makes a huge difference in the productivity and work quality of programmers and scientists is steady deliberate practice building up problem-solving skills and growth mindset, along with accumulation of domain-specific knowledge.<p><a href=""http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/course/6/6.055/readings/ericsson-charness-am-psychologist.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/course/6/6.055/readings/eric...</a>",1304088782

I personally don't know of a single startup that did this and didn't have to fire the guy after a few months (with lots of time and money wasted.) Seriously, not a single one out of dozens.<p>The problem stems from the fact that most seasoned sales/business guys have experience in larger companies, running established teams, which is radically different than working in a startup and having to fill every role yourself in addition to building up the team from scratch. The other problem is, quite frankly, that most of these old sales guys are at a stage in their life where working 60-80 hours a week isn't something they want to do, and so they will be very very difficult to fit into a healthy startup culture where hard work and overtime are required.<p>We hired a former VP sales from a big ($100M+) company in our space. A guy who was a founder at a few successful startups and had a kick ass resume in general. He was even a great salesman. 6 months later and $100k down the drain we had to fire him.<p>My advice is make sure that if you give this guy equity that it vests over a few years with a 1 year cliff, and that if you give him a salary that it's very modest, mostly commission based.<p>Odds are you're going to have to fire him, but if you want to take a chance, go for it.",1304087793

I <i>think</i> I ultimately got the point, but I'm going to share my struggles here in the hope that it will help the author. Then again, maybe it's just me who is completely ignorant of the WP7 ecosystem. I'm still interested though, because I find that lessons learned building for any platform, be it WP7, iOS, Android, Twitter, or Facebook, are often cross-applicable to another.<p>--<p>State your thesis early on and make sure it is clear. I <i>think</i> this is probably the closest thing to a thesis in the article, but I can't tell because the sentence is malformed:<p>While it is indeed possible to make money on WP7 creating a relatively high budget indie game (say anything over $500) will probably not pay good returns unless it has XBL support and marketting.<p>When using parentheses, the reader should be able to skip the information contained therein, and still read the sentence. If we remove the parenthetical information, we get:<p>""While it is indeed possible to make money on WP7 creating a relatively high budget indie game will probably not pay good returns unless it has XBL support and marketting.""<p>I ended up assuming you meant:<p>""While it is indeed possible to make money on WP7 creating a relatively high budget indie game, your efforts will probably not pay good returns unless it has XBL support and marketting.""<p>Or maybe it's this:<p>""While it is indeed possible to make money on WP7, creating a relatively high budget indie game will probably not pay good returns unless it has XBL support and marketting.""<p>I didn't arrive at that last interpretation until I had written this entire post, then came back to proofread what I'd written. This really reenforces my last point: grammar and punctuation matters. I acknowledge that it could just be me as a poor reader. There may be plenty of people who can breeze through the article, but my ability to comprehend the writing was constantly interrupted by the inability to parse the phrasing of a sentence.<p>--<p>Provide context for your reader. With WP7 being so new, it is likely that the reader is not actively developing for WP7, but is considering doing so. Your advice is particularly well suited for them, but there are many points in the article where I wasn't clear about some distinctions:<p>""An XBL game released in any given week will have more exposure to market than a game that is #1 on a popular list.""<p>""The fact of the matter is XBL games get much more exposure both in the market place and advertising of the device, they get even more exposure than the popular games lists.""<p>I don't have any context for what constitutes an XBL game and a non-XBL game, so the contrast between a game released on XBL and one that is ""#1 on a popular list"" doesn't provide enough context. XBL seems obvious enough, but what's this popular list? Is it third-party. Is it somewhere on the phone?<p>It would be useful to preface these statements with a short paragraph outlining the choice you face as a developer: releasing a game on XBL vs releasing on your own.<p>--<p>Grammar and puncutation matters. Grammar and punctuation are like programming syntax. You wouldn't expect your compiler to interpret code that omits important syntactical elements, would you? The same applies to grammar.

The negotiations I was familiar with went on for years, and often focused on minute trivia or sudden left field issues. Looking back, I'm pretty sure many of these things were simple delaying tactics, though that was far from clear at the time. The industry was developing a number of their own solutions (several of which would never see the light of day) and had more or less picked a leading industry platform that was a bit farther behind the first wave. Much of the rest ended up as simple pricing leverage, each DRM or anti-piracy or marketing requirement ending up being used simply to nickel and dime the negotiations to death.<p>In the end, when one major competitor came close to launch negotiations across the industry suddenly became much easier. Another consideration is the industry's significant inclination to punish people who they felt worked against them - and Mr. Roberts most certainly fits in this category.<p>There are a number of ways to interpret all of this, but I wouldn't suggest that these demands should be taken at face value.<p>In this light, I think Amazon's approach of ""ask for forgiveness"" makes a ton of sense.

Personally, I would replace the free plan with a working demo, so people can kick the tires. But definitely lower the free plan to one design.<p>I think you need to address the line that says ""Requires an HTML5 compliant browser."" For one, it's not clear enough whether you mean the <i>builder</i> needs HTML5 or the <i>output</i> requires it. In any event, I think you should frame it by telling the user which browsers will work -- those are terms they'll better be able to understand, especially considering you're aiming for the market of people who don't know what they're doing online.<p>Anyway, there's my two cents.

If it doesn't, you can steal the cookie and log in as a user.<p>Outside of that, the site appears to use a cookie called _sharebymail_session_id, which is scoped the same as auth_token but which is marked HttpOnly, which means it can't be accessed directly via Javascript.<p>In order to really exploit this vulnerability, you would need to find a way to send requests to and read responses from posterous.com, the root domain, since that's where all the functionality is defined.",1304085968

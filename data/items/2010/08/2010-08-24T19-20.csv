  that has a huge impact on carbon dating.
</code></pre>
No, the effect is very extremely small and this has no impact at all. Lets suppose that:<p>* we measure differences of 1/1000th in decay rates (this is reasonable given the differences the article is based on)<p>* the average variation is 1/1000th, otherwise it would have been detected earlier.<p>* the halflife of C14 is 5000 years (to make calculations easy)<p>* we are determining the age of something 20000 years old (carbon dating is only used for ages in that order of magnitude).<p>* the decay formula is y = x(1/2)^(t/tau), where y is the amount of C14 you will measure after <i>t</i> years, <i>tau</i> is the halflife in years and <i>x</i> is the initial amount of C14 we obtained via other means.<p>We measure an amount of C14 that's 2^4 times smaller than current amounts and conclude that the amount of C14 was halved 4 times. If the decay rate was actually 1/1000th larger on average, then we should have conclude that 2^(-4) = 1/2^(t/5005) or t = 20020 years. In other words: the error is as large as the relative seasonal variation, which is quite small already and probably falls well within the regular error bars.",1282679668

In fact, that's probably the biggest hurdle to get over for anyone coming from the business side.  If all you have is an idea and no tech co-founder to share it with then the worst thing you could do is spin wheels trying to find the right partner.

1630907,comment,1629794,1629794,0,0,mian2zi3,,,"One perspective is that physics at this level is purely descriptive.  Hawking, in his response to Penrose in the book The Large, the Small, and the Human Mind, writes: ""[I believe] that physics theories are just mathematical models we construct, and that it is meaningless to ask if they correspond to reality, just whether they predict observations.""  It is a common mistake for people to confuse a physical theory like Newtonian mechanics or general relativity for reality itself.  I feel like an explanation of gravity at this point is a metaphysical question that is outside the realm of science.  It may be that science ultimately comes up with an explanation, but it will be in terms of something else and you will naturally be led to ask, what is an explanation of THAT thing?<p>As for your description ""... two objects attract each other ...,"" this is an outdated, Newtonian way of thinking about gravity.  It involves a ""spooky"" action at a distance.  As I understand it, it is generally thought that the best theories are purely local ones.  General relativity is the proper local formulation of gravity: masses curve space, and all objects move in ""straight"" lines (that is, geodesics) through curved space.  Newton was right about inertia.  There might be more sophisticated ways of understanding gravity in quantum gravity, but that's beyond me.",1282679317

Both of these are experimentally motivated.<p>However, that's not the only way to obtain SR. You can, for example, assume Maxwell's equations (or any of the higher-level electrodynamic field formulations) and postulate #1, and obtain the invariant speed of light as the only valid solution for self-propagating EM waves in free space.

1630867,story,,,2,0,nollidge,"Ask HN: Muggles and wizards",,"I was just reading the Successful Software blog post ""10 things non-technical users don’t understand about your software"", and then ensuing HN discussion, and was inspired to start spitballing here.<p>My idea is: I have always wanted to start some sort of educational website for people like those that Andy describes - that have never used copy-paste, don't understand what files are, etc.<p>To me, the fundamental problem is that most people think computers are magic; that they're turtles all the way down. And this is somewhat a problem of our (programmers and engineers) making. We create these abstractions for users, but when they inevitably break down, we expect them to grok the next level down. Is there a way to break this cycle, to educate these muggles in the Ways of Computation? Personally, I learned because I was self-motivated. I noticed, probably around age 8 or 9, that there was this world inside the machines that could be manipulated by those who spoke the right incantations, and I had the audacity to think I could learn to be such a wizard. Can someone learn these things without such a motivation? Do they need to?<p>I can understand how not everyone wants to be a computer programmer, certainly (because I don't want to be, say, an architect), but can't everyone learn what it is to <i>be one</i>? We all understand, roughly, how an architect does their job, the constraints they must consider, because building physical objects is incredibly intuitive to anyone who's ever stacked wooden blocks. And for me, computation is just as intuitive, but <i>what was the key insight</i>? Was it gradual? I feel like maybe my assembly language and binary logic classes may have been when my feet finally touched the ground, but that wasn't until college. Does it need to take that long? Certainly my learning was in fits and starts--my brain was stuck in procedural BASIC mode for probably a decade before discovering OO and beyond.<p>Another roadblock is that, in some sense, programmers and computer engineers are a bunch of liars. We talk about, for example, object-oriented programming, but there aren't any objects. We just made them up. Our ""object"" is a set of bits, probably not even in a contiguous sequence in memory. And we point at it and call it an object when it looks nothing like all the other nouns. It's an utter deception. We are conjurers, not in any supernatural sense, but in the Penn-and-Teller sense that there's a secret trick to everything we do. Teller's not actually teleporting around the stage; he's just crawling (albeit deftly and with great practice) through a hidden chamber. Gamers aren't blowing up aliens; they're just standing atop a mountain of abstractions designed to fool them (willingly) into having that experience. There's a reasonable explanation for everything happening on the screen.<p>I guess my dream would be to teach computing in a completely non-magical way, to have people understand that the turtles stop, as far as computing goes, at on-off switches. You can't start there, though, because most people would get discouraged by the vast disconnect between ""on-off"" and ""Toy Story"".<p>Anyway, in case it isn't obvious, it's all very fuzzy in my head at this point. I know that I was particularly inspired by the style and flow of guides like Joel Spolsky's http://hginit.com (a Mercurial tutorial), _why's Poignant Guide to Ruby, and Learn You A Haskell for Great Good!, but these are obviously just primers on specific technologies, not a way to learn <i>computing itself</i>, or however you would describe what I want to do. I'm not sure the communication mode would translate.<p>Does this make any sense? Has anyone tried to do something like this before?",1282678608

You can get it down to 30-60 seconds if you have an autodialer, but 90 seconds is a generous estimate even without. So figure 90 seconds per call, 30.42 calls per month per customer, you have 45 minutes per customer per month. $10 for 45 minutes is $13 per hour. $10 per hour labor (a generous rate for US-based English speaking labor) leaves a very thin margin, but still potentially profitable.<p>If you scaled this, you'd want to have a VoIP autodialer system, at which point you'd get down to maybe 60 seconds per call average, which is 30 minutes per customer per month, which is $20/hour revenue, so $10/hour labor would give you $10/hour on top of that to cover everything else. You could do this with call centers, which imposes real estate cost, or you could have a web-based system for employees to connect into from home, which also gives you the benefit of being able to hire them as independent contractors instead of employees and hence not having to worry about their taxes or health care.<p>There's further optimizations you could make. $10/hour is a high rate for paying people to place unwanted phone calls to complete strangers. I know because that's more than what I made doing that job. If you were running a call center of stoned teenagers and college students, you could probably get away with paying them $8/hour to call up subscribers and tell them they're awesome. Yes, most call centers are staffed by stoned teenagers and college students, at least the ones in charge of making scripted, outgoing calls. Well, at least mine was.",1282677500

The old Saturday Night Live 'Stuart Smalley' is an unfortunate social stigma that stopped me from ever taking the practice seriously until I was shown some hard evidence of it's effectiveness (no, I don't have it on hand, you can google as easily as me).<p>So I gave it a try. Then I tried it some more. Over time it really takes a transformation. At first I really felt like Stuart; but that is because I didn't believe the things I was saying. If I kept lowering the bar eventually I could find compliments about myself that I actually thought were true. The good feelings and confidence those smaller compliments gave me helped boost me to higher levels, and up and up, until the point now where I feel an abundance of confidence in most of my day to day interactions that I never had before.<p>Affirmations are really just a mind hack to architect your internal reality intentionally. You DO have an inner reality, so why not try to take control of it? :)<p>EDIT: Oh, but back to this startup.. I like this idea, but I hope they understand the principles behind affirmation therapy as a part of CBT. Simply telling someone they are awesome will have no actual affect if they don't believe what you are saying, so there needs to be a little bit of a day-to-day feedback process to hone in on the target emotions you want to generate. I doubt this much effort is being put in, but I might be willing to drop $10 to find out. :)",1282677465

The experimental evidence supports most aspects of this hypothesis, except that they were expecting a somewhat faster period. Given the facts that the surface of the sun rotates once every 28 days and that our period is caused by the solar core, whose exact rotation rate is unknown, it is not unreasonable to suppose this is the first evidence to show that the rotation rate of the core of the sun is somewhat lower than that of the surface.

They easily make that time only on work time.. not that it helps.<p><i>..they don’t know how to (or even that they can) copy and paste text.</i><p>Some users don't.

In my experience regular office users don't set up or update anything, ever!<p><i>Data storage</i><p>File system hierarchy and network mount points are so far off the average user horizon that you shouldn't bother anyway. You just point to it in the file explorer. Everything else is completely pointless.<p>As for filetypes and converting: ok, that's a valid point. It's a good idea to send instructions with it, as it is a somewhat non-common task.<p><i>The jargon you use</i><p>I agree. Talk the users language, not computer slang.<p><i>You should therefore never put something only in a right click menu or anywhere else that it can’t easily be discovered.</i><p>Please, I beg you. Put stuff where you would normally expect it from your WM / OS. If it would be in the context menu, then put it there. Normally you also put stuff in the menu bar / ribbon / icon bar depending on conventions. Don't try to invent new interface guidelines, you'll probably fail.. horribly.<p><i>Concurrency</i><p>Try not to expose them or avoid it entirely (rework the workflow if necessary). Otherwise build the interface in a way that clearly notifies the user of this circumstance.<p><i>Non-technical users aren’t so confident and won’t try things in the same way.

People also always agree to me in this respect. Doesn't help, they never actually do it, much less spend money on it. Could as well talk to the wall..<p><i>That they should read the documentation</i><p>I totally agree. No one will read your precious documentation.

The article clarifies that the sort of people others resent is the person who is too eager to volunteer for things, thus raising the bar for everyone and creating more work.<p>If someone at your office worked 16 hours a day, making you look bad, even though nobody would reasonably expect you to work that long if your colleague didn't do it, wouldn't you resent them?<p>Unfortunately, it's all relative, so the fact that he's hard-working makes you look lazy by comparison.",1282676710

Here's an quote from it:<p>""I find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that the seemingly impossible is possible. Africa has not done bad. In 50 years they've gone from a pre-Medieval situation to a very decent 100-year-ago Europe, with a functioning nation and state. I would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world during the last 50 years. Because we don't consider where they came from. It's this stupid concept of developing countries which puts us, Argentina and Mozambique together 50 years ago, and says that Mozambique did worse. We have to know a little more about the world. I have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine. He knows everything. He knows the name of the grape, the temperature and everything. I only know two types of wine -- red and white. (Laughter) But my neighbor only knows two types of countries -- industrialized and developing. And I know 200, I know about the small data. But you can do that.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_reveals_new_insights_on_poverty.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_reveals_new_insights_o...</a>",1282676561

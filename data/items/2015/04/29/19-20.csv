9461254,comment,9457507,9457507,0,0,mikeash,,,"I thought it was a bit silly until I saw that he&#x27;s talking about C++.<p>The smart-everything, RAII-everything approach that most C++ uses these days tends to make everything a little bit slow. In other languages, there&#x27;s usually a small number of places that are slow, and everything else is inconsequential. In C++ you end up spending a lot of time spread among a million different bits of code twiddling smart pointers and RAIIing things that don&#x27;t really need it.<p>I completely lost it at this paragraph, though:<p>&quot;If you tell yourself, <i>itâs only a malloc, itâs nothing</i>, and you do this often enough, you will end up with 25000 temporary allocs for a single keystroke.  They may only take 50ns each, but I type 529 characters per minute.&quot;<p>That works out to 1.1% CPU utilization when typing at full bore. (50ns * 25000 * 529/minute = 0.011.) In the abstract, that&#x27;s high. But in a practical sense, it&#x27;s completely irrelevant.<p>Shaving CPU cycles off the keystroke handler of an app that only uses 1% CPU in the hands of a fast typist is a massive waste of the programmer&#x27;s time. This paragraph is followed by:<p>&quot;When these sorts of things are pointed out, people aught to respond by fixing the problem, so that they can deliver a better product.  Instead, they typically start arguing with you about why itâs not that big a deal.&quot;<p>Well yes, because it&#x27;s <i>not</i> that big of a deal. There are better places to spend your time. A product that uses 0.01% CPU while typing at full bore is not noticeably better than one that uses 1% CPU. You won&#x27;t &quot;deliver a better product&quot; by addressing this, you&#x27;ll waste a bunch of time you could have spent building a product that&#x27;s actually better.",1430337374

They&#x27;ll even go so far as to pick out which types of ICMP messages to pass through.<p>The internet at large has been sitting on SCTP for a very long time, because nobody expects SCTP to be able to get through firewalls.

In the past it has been made to run on BSD and Windows through Cygwin, but these need a lot more work before being production ready.<p>It&#x27;s also significantly more flexible than other package managers due to how it can handle multiple versions of the same package in an elegant way.

Originally, the ARPANET end-to-end \n  protocol NCP was a &quot;kitchen sink&quot; oriented toward providing remote \n  teletype-centric access using the &quot;telnet&quot; protocol and the &quot;FTP&quot; \n  protocol to remote machines over a packet network.\n\n  A group of us, interested in a mix of real-time telephony, local area \n  networks, distributed operating systems, and communications security, \n  argued for several years for a datagram based network, rather than a \n  virtual circuit based network. The group involved me, John Schoch and \n  Yogen Dalal of Xerox PARC, Danny Cohen of ISI (now at Caltech, I think), \n  and Steve Crocker, with Jon Postel as a supporter, and Vint Cerf and Bob \n  Kahn as neutral referees.\n\n  UDP was actually &quot;designed&quot; in 30 minutes on a blackboard when we decided \n  pull the original TCP protocol apart into TCP and IP, and created UDP on \n  top of IP as an alternative for multiplexing and demultiplexing IP \n  datagrams inside a host among the various host processes or tasks. But it \n  was a placeholder that enabled all the non-virtual-circuit protocols since \n  then to be invented, including encapsulation, RTP, DNS, ..., without having \n  to negotiate for permission either to define a new protocol or to extend \n  TCP by adding &quot;features&quot;.\n</code></pre>\n[1] &quot;udp and me&quot; <a href=""http://www.reed.com/blog-dpr/?page_id=6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reed.com/blog-dpr/?page_id=6</a>",1430336572

This is demonstrated by the fact that it doesn&#x27;t correlate with statistical evidence.

People holding no degree are vastly more likely to be unemployed or hold a minimum wage, manual labor job. People holding a degree (even a lower tier degree), are much more likely than the no-degree group to have a more desirable job that pays relatively well.<p>There may be many factors explaining why this disparity exists. But certainly one reason is that <i>many</i> companies currently require an applicant have a college degree even for non-desirable entry-level jobs. If you don&#x27;t have a degree, you&#x27;re not even getting your foot in the door.

The reason is that mobile networks have a MAC/RLC layer (talking 3G/4G here, e.g. LTE) and those layers have ARQ (in other words retrans). At times, those re-trans can spike (sudden Signal drop for example). That will blow the RTO on TCP and you get needless TCP retrans. This is where you have to competing retrans  mechanisms flapping.  The obvious fix would be for the mobile operators to terminate the TCP flow at the base station and use the Hybrid ARQ mechanism, although that could happen eventually, but would mean a lot of re-design for them i.e. cost. So if your app is going to be on mobile, it  might perform better using a connectionless protocol depending on the situation.",1430335764

If you run Java-like code on the CLR, I would expect it to not be as fast or have as high GC throughput as Hotspot, especially if the Java code has been tuned to Hotspot - there are particular fast paths for certain operations that kick in, where if your code is a little bit too far from the optimized idiom, you end up 3-5x slower. For regular code, I wouldn&#x27;t expect a big gap between CLR and JVM; a lot of Java code is dominated by pointer chasing because the primary tool of abstraction is a heap-allocated object. C# written in the same way will be bottlenecked in similar ways on cache misses, TLB misses, etc.<p>There&#x27;s a larger variety of JVMs designed for a broader range of hardware, the most interesting to me being Azul and their GC tech.<p>But the CLR gives you some different tactical options. Value types and unsafe code let you do things that are far more expensive or awkward on the JVM. Writing a significant amount of functionality that does no heap allocation is more feasible on the CLR than JVM. Native interop is an order of magnitude easier. The CLR is generally much faster to start up; Java terminal apps don&#x27;t suit interactive use. The library linking story is much more pleasant too, with a single dynamically linked executable referencing GAC-installed assemblies, rather than stringing together enormously long class paths.",1430335557

And quite frankly, that made me shiver a bit for Firefox and (less so) for Chrome.<p>See, what if Microsoft plain-wrapped their browser, made it seamless and ubiquitous?  Perhaps this is what they were envisioning with the original Active Desktop style integration?  (And no, I&#x27;m not talking about Metro tiles, blurgh.)  A successful plain-wrapped browser is like an unstoppable ideology for me, there&#x27;s no name to put to the enemy.  Internet Explorer could be demonized - it had a marketdroid-crafted icon, it had a NAME.<p>I honestly can&#x27;t conceive of what such a plain-wrapped browser experience would look because I like having multiple browser windows and I like tabbed browser windows.  It does need to work something like an application, at least for me.  For that matter, we can&#x27;t continue Fisher Price&#x27;ing up our user experiences, apps like browsers need to be productivity focused and not cater to the 3 year olds and other neophytes.  That Metro Internet Explorer browser experience in Windows 8 was a joke.  Take up way WAY less screen real estate with the browser chrome, cut it out with hip, annoying animations, show me my information and be quick about it.<p>I feel the PRODUCT NAME needs to go - Edge needs to fade away and just be there in the background as a vaguely recognizable, essential, but rather bland and uninteresting part of the overall computing experience.  If Edge did fade into the background and become this trusty thing with its own signature user experience and pleasant signature flourishes or painting style or whatever, then it would more easily make the jump to new devices, autos, televisions, billboards, etc.  The exact same bland, trusty experience would be expected everywhere.<p>I feel egos probably drove this naming decision.

Because I used to work in the fast food industry as a GM. Whenever CA increased the min wage, the first thing our owner would do is ask us how much more this was going to cost us, then he&#x27;d instruct us to cut the number of hours scheduled. Because in fast food, it&#x27;s not like it only affects the workers making minimum wage, it bumps the entire pay scale. So if min wage is raised by $1, everyone working hourly gets a $1 bump. For a restaurant that has say 100 man hours of labor a day, that means $100 extra cost per day right out of the owner&#x27;s pocket. Multiply that by 365 and you have a pissed off owner. He can&#x27;t always raise prices, and labor costs are the largest controllable expense. So what happens is that each store manager is told that they need to make everyone work harder, and they have to cut $100 worth of labor each day. So the survivors get more money, but they get worked harder; the losers get their hours cut, or they don&#x27;t get hired as the positions/hours are not replaced when attrition occurs.

The irony is that through his involvement in JavaScript and Mozilla, he has likely done more for the LGBT community than I have and I&#x27;m part of that community. Should I disregard that incidental impact because of the smaller, intentional impact coming from his personal life?<p>I admire Mozilla as a profoundly transparent and open culture. The CEO does set the tone so the conversation is completely justified but this isn&#x27;t so much a conversation as it is picketing and posturing. I wouldn&#x27;t want my legacy to be reduced to one of the many things I disagree with the world about. I would want people to see the full context of my impact, disagree with me where I went wrong, and respect our differences.",1395953984

But at that point we were only looking to see if the problem we were trying to solve was real - not fit our solution in.<p>Once you know you&#x27;re solving a problem that exists, you can&#x27;t figure out fit by just talking to people - you need to throw out a (crappy) version and let real people play. We don&#x27;t have the time/ $$s to spend months and THEN know we don&#x27;t have a fit. So decided to roll out an MDP in pre-beta cycles called &quot;Omega&#x27;s&quot; (story: blog.germ.io/wtfs-an-omega/). In the last week, we&#x27;ve had over 800 signups and 200 users we&#x27;ve opened access to, so I guess the challenge is to build -> ship -> iterate.<p>The family and friends you talk to before you have a prototype  are the people who&#x27;d <i>tell</i> you they think your stuff is cool, but would never take their wallets out if they weren&#x27;t doing you a personal favor.

I can&#x27;t help feeling that this is like saying there&#x27;s no electrical activity in a battery when it&#x27;s not wired up, therefore the electricity must be coming from somewhere else outside the battery.<p>Mind, I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with his thesis; for reasons of my own I think there&#x27;s something to his notion of brain-as-antenna.

In particular, Deutsch points out that if the universe needs reals that includes a whole bunch of noncomputable numbers, and in fact our favorite model of physics for a significant chunk of history (&#x27;classical physics&#x27;) did require reals and so was noncomputable.<p>I also tend to assume that nature is computable, but I don&#x27;t think these assertions have really &quot;held up for a damn long time&quot;.<p>As well as the fact that we managed with not much of a model followed by a noncomputable one for most of history, it seems to me that there might be a bias towards finding computable models over noncomputable models, which makes any reasoning based on observing that we&#x27;ve found a bunch of computable models suspect.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church-Turing-Deutsch_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church-Turing-Deutsch_principl...</a>",1395953694

Eleanor of Aquitaine was &quot;Aliénor&quot; in Bordeaux and &quot;Eléonore&quot; in Paris. Only with the gradual bureaucratisation of daily life in Europe did this start to change. In some conservative cultural settings, it still holds true: even today Prince Charles is called &quot;Carlos&quot; in Spain or Portugal. Living in France, I much rather have people pronounce the French variant of my name, purely because it flows better and even sounds closer to the native version than their attempts at reading a foreign ortograph. I am always surprised with how punctilious people from the Americas are with the about spellings and variants of their names, although I understand where they&#x27;re coming from.

I was working on some cool stuff, was getting the extra responsibilities I wanted and putting in at least 10 hour days every day. I was learning, and hacking and building at an awesome pace.<p>Until, like a switch, my eyes dried up and I could barely keep them open. Literally in the span of an hour or so I was happily hacking away to driving myself home opening one eye at a time. Since then it&#x27;s been more of the same. Avoiding bad lighting, no more TV, limited computer use.<p>I&#x27;ve seen 3 Opthamologists, some name brand ones, some research clinics. They all tell me I have Blepharitis, which I disagree with (which I know sounds crazy). I wake up with tired, dry eyes and it&#x27;s a battle all day long. I&#x27;ve tried lots of things, low light, low contrast, fish oil pills, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, cold compresses, hot compresses, drops of all kinds, special computer glasses, restasis, books, meditation, etc.<p>To be honest, it&#x27;s been hell. I worry about my future career and it&#x27;s negatively affected relationships. It&#x27;s gotten somewhat better, but it is still a constant discomfort. I just try to keep my eyes relaxed, eye drops nearby, and massage them frequently.<p>So, give your eyes a break once in a while and be more mindful of them. I bet if I listened to my body at the time it would have told me my eyes were strained and I should give it a break.<p>If anyone else suffers similarly, please reach out would really appreciate chatting with people in similar situations.",1395953424

7483304,comment,7479550,7479626,1,0,ambrop7,,,"A common and simple way to treat FP mathematically is by bounding the result with the machine epsion u [1]. For example, given FP numbers x and y:<p>x <fp_mul> y = (1+e)xy ;  abs(e) <= u<p>The u ideally depends only on the FP format and rounding mode. I say ideally because library functions like sqrt may be less precise than the ideal (which is the result being equal to the exact value rounded according to the rounding mode). Note that the abstraction only as long as you don&#x27;t go outside the range of normal exponents (it breaks when you reach infinity or subnormal).<p>EXAMPLE. Suppose we have a FP value L representing a length of something, and want to split it into segments no longer than the FP value M. Assume both integers are small enough to be representable in FP. The answer in exact arithmetic is:<p>N = ceil(L/M).<p>However if we evaluate this in FP, we may get a result N&#x27;<N for certain edge values. Which means one of the segment lengths we output will be greater than M!. So the result of the algorithm is incorrect!<p>We can fix it by multiplying (L/M) with a number sufficiently greater than one before the ceil, at the cost of sometimes deciding to split into one more segment than mathematically necessary. The fixed FP algorithm may then be:<p>N&#x27; = ceil(1.00005 <fp_mul> (L <fp_div> M))<p>After we apply the machine epsilon formulas we come to the conclusion that:<p>N&#x27; = ceil( (1+e1)(1+e2)<i>1.00005 </i> (L/M) )   ; abs(e1)<=u, abs(e2)<=u<p>We then show that:<p>(1+e1)(1+e2)*1.00005 >= 1.<p>This proves that what the algorithm gives to the ceil function is not less the exact value L/M, and that N&#x27;>=N. And ceil() can&#x27;t make errors by definition, assuming the integer value is representable.

Taking that fMRI data alone, researchers used their statistical library to reconstruct the faces their subjects were viewing.&quot;<p>So yes, it will always output something like a face.

7483121,comment,7480706,7481794,3,0,waps,,,"There are people here who come from countries that were the target of America&#x27;s equally fabricated reason to get into WWII. I would love to thank the US government for fabricating that (at the very least blowing one incident way out of proportion). My family has killed people for simply being on the wrong side of that battle, merely to make some profit selling pigs, or repairing plumming. You know what ? They were right too.<p>The problem with Syria is that the government is in the right. Or at least, it&#x27;s less wrong. The rebels want to do religious cleansing of the country and the government wants to survive, and it&#x27;s own ethnic group to survive. Of course Iran, equally being the target of the sunni muslim religious cleansing, supports their not-quite-brothers. Erdogan wants to &quot;help&quot; the rebels because he&#x27;s on the side that wants to do ethnic and religious cleansing in Syria, and presumably because it would distract from his local problems. The problem in Iraq is the same basic thing. The good thing is that sunni muslim attacks in Syria, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan are mostly their actions out of western nations.<p>But please don&#x27;t be so stupid as to think they&#x27;re ok with the US and generally the rest of the world just because they don&#x27;t want to turn a 5-front war into a 100-front one. And also don&#x27;t make the mistake of assuming they don&#x27;t have support in America or don&#x27;t have massive support in Europe. Both from local muslims living there, and from the governments that are afraid of these mad attacks.<p>As for Turkey, what do you really expect the leader of a sunni muslim religious party to do, except declare himself caliph and behave like he owns the world ? What exactly do you think he means when he says that &quot;some&quot; parts of sharia should be introduced ? You think he means to stop at &quot;some&quot; ? Really ? Religious freedom ? Sadly there are hundreds of millions of people who believe doing this is the answer to all the world&#x27;s problems.<p>Please keep in mind that before Kemal Ataturk, Turkey, then the Ottoman empire, effectively the state of sunni islam that so many muslims are trying to recreate, had waged a 1500-year long war against the Europe, Asia and Africa. Then in WWI allah&#x27;s caliph was overthrown, all but declared illegal (you wouldn&#x27;t believe the number of imams killed and threatened in the 1918 - today period), and the war stopped, to be replaced with the cold war. The nightmare scenario is that this original war resumes.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/oct/19/turkeys-abrupt-about-face/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/oct/19/turkeys-abru...</a>",1395951323

So, I remember reading about something called the Red Scare that blackballed people because of their political views. Is that really the way the LGBT community wants to be viewed: Love us or we&#x27;ll ruin your life? People don&#x27;t see things the same way, and that&#x27;s their right.

By comparing the subjects&#x27; responses to the new images, the software in the study presumably did its best to create composite images by pulling from the corpus.<p>So this raises many questions: How diverse were the faces in the training corpus? How close were the new images to those in the corpus? When you&#x27;re looking at hundreds of images to train the machine, are you also unknowingly being trained to think about images in a certain way? What happens when you try to recreate faces based on the fMRI responses of subjects who didn&#x27;t contribute to the initial training set?<p>The implications of the last question are pretty interesting .

Well, to be fair, incubator is kind of a nebulous term.<p>I define incubator as: &quot;entity that charges entrepreneurs for privileged access to ostensibly valuable [x y z]&quot; or &quot;entity that hires so called &#x27;entrepreneurs in residence&#x27; to build companies under its roof in exchange for exorbitant equity.&quot;<p>YC is only superficially similar to whatever you would describe Harlem Biospace as.<p>The essential difference is in how the two types of entities derive value from their offering.<p>The distinction is that [YC, 500S, TechStars] invest in the upside of companies. Harlem [and its ilk] make money per unit of offering sold [units of monthly [x y z] access].<p>The reason &quot;incubators&quot; (the ones that charge entrepreneurs) are usually worse than the YC&#x27;s of the world is \nbecause they adversely select for all the wrong things, as a side effect of their design.<p>Since an incubator ostensibly helps startups win big, why <i>charge</i> per unit [startup]? Why not <i>invest</i> in portfolio upside?<p><i>Per unit charges</i> seem to be a good way of making money in the <i>near</i> term, at a constant rate (might not be sustainable if companies don&#x27;t succeed in the long run.)<p>Upside <i>investment</i> seems like a good way to make money in the <i>long run</i> (assuming you are sufficiently able to (a) pick the right startups and/or (b) influence them to succeed.)<p>So <i>investment</i> seems to signal that you believe that you can do (a) and/or (b).<p>Sure, an investment portfolio may lose money on most of the companies. However, if it has a group of companies of sufficient expected success, one will likely reap massive returns.<p>If the value <i>investors</i> provide is worth enough to attract the right kinds of founders, the expected value of <i>investing</i> in entrepreneurs should exceed the expected value of <i>charging</i> entrepreneurs.<p>In the long run, <i>charging</i> per unit of offering, may signal that the long-term value of the seller&#x27;s [x y z] offering is relatively low when compared to entities that are willing to <i>invest</i> in entrepreneurs.<p>Basically, if you value the <i>unit cost</i> higher than the <i>investment return</i> you are signaling that you (a) can&#x27;t pick good startups and/or (b) you can&#x27;t help a sufficient number succeed.<p>What kind of entrepreneur would want to go to that entity?<p>Since portfolio companies tend to return value later in their timeline, long-term value of offering is what matters. The YC&#x27;s of the world are willing to eat the short-term costs and bet that they will influence some startups to return big.<p>The Harlem&#x27;s of the world are making a constant per unit income, but are unwilling to bet on the long tail equity upside.<p>These incubators are not equivalent to [YC, 500S, TechStars], they are glorified co-working spaces.<p>[Update: If you&#x27;ve read this far, please see the discussion further on the thread. I unfairly characterized Harlem as an &quot;incubator&quot;. Harlem Biospace certainly offers value. I do stand by my comment on &quot;incubation&quot; in the context of consumer internet companies. It&#x27;s a different ball game for capital intensive industries. One aspect of Harlem is that it is affordable lab space that is group funded. Undeniably important.]",1395950815

Sure, you could keep patching the compiled version (not very easy) or use some kind of instrumentation to wrap/modify existing behavior, but if you can&#x27;t easily modify the source of your past work (or just a single revision along the way), then all you&#x27;re doing is piling more patches (in compiled form) on top of old work - not very efficient, and you lose flexibility.<p>In a non-destructive workflow, you may (for example) adjust the color balance of a single object in the scene, keep working, and then realize that the color adjustments are out of place. Since that adjustment is preserved and editable at any time independently of all other edits, then it only requires an adjustment of the parameters - and you don&#x27;t lose any information.<p>If you were to do that kind of edit directly to the pixels (even if they&#x27;re on a separate layer for the object in question), then each time you adjust color/levels/etc, you&#x27;re <i>losing information</i> that was originally there.

I tried out similarly priced Sennheiser in-ear headphones (ie80 and ie800) as well as another higher priced JH Audio IEM model (JH13, iirc), but the 535&#x27;s sounded the best to my ears.<p>I do see that the Westone&#x27;s offer 4 drivers to the 535&#x27;s two drivers, but unfortunately Headroom doesn&#x27;t have the frequency response graphs for them yet. Otherwise, they seem very similar for features & specs (they both appear to use the same ear tips, which is good for finding the one that fits the best).<p>Of course, I&#x27;m lucky enough to live in Headroom&#x27;s home town, so that helps these kinds of purchases immensely.",1395950483

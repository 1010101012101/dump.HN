372920,comment,372758,372758,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"I have to respectfully disagree here, having done a bit of unit testing myself (JUnit, XMLUnit, CPPUnit). I think the better way to approach unit testing is have a resource on your team dedicated to unit tests, that way, one does not have to write unit tests for code oneself has written. I think I sense that is the big gripe, that writing unit tests on top of the deliverable takes time and is ""boring"". I worked at a place where I was on the development team, but my sole task, or primary task at any rate, was writing CPPUnit unit tests. I actually enjoyed it alot personally, found lots of bugs that never would have been found otherwise, and the QA department ""felt better"" knowing the deliverable had been unit tested before being delivered to QA. So, having done unit testing myself, sure I am ""biased"" but I think it makes for more stable deliverables to QA and therefore speeds up the whole QA cycle as a result. But probably ideally I would agree that having a different person write unit tests than the person who wrote the code being tested is good, in terms of not adding more work to an already over-worked developer.",1227358498

372913,comment,372699,372834,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"And the Gmail engineers should add an opt-out ""high security"" mode that checks the referer to make sure the form submission is coming from Gmail itself and not some outside website. This way people who like to use custom/blank referers can ignore this security concern if they want, and all the rest of us can prevent the risk of this problem.<p>EDIT: Or how about just adding an in-line Javascript variable? Say, on all Gmail pages, you could embed this in the page:<p><pre><code>   <script>var SECURITY_KEY = ""918028cd79a5ba47e83e6ba68d036ca3"";</script>
</code></pre>
And then when sending AJAX or form requests in the background, make sure to include that as a request parameter. That way, even if the user has the right authentication cookies, external websites won't be able to fool Gmail into thinking they are Gmail.<p>Really, this doesn't seem like a very hard problem to solve...couple lines of code...",1227356616

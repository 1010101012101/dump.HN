1236209,comment,1235153,1235478,0,0,krig,,,"Oh, absolutely.. it's impossible to predict the future. But yes, looking at the current data the whole argument seems to fall apart: As far as I know, the movie industry is doing better and better each year, and I think the same is true for TV. Reality TV shows certainly represent successful change.<p>I agree that the middlemen are the ones that _should_ be in trouble, just like in the music industry. If successful TV and music can be produced without studios or actually distributing anything physically, the result should be a more direct system. It could be that the change is happening while at the same time the whole entertainment market is growing hugely (more and more people living comfortable lives, devices that make it easy to grab entertainment time where available), so that even failing businesses are growing, just slower than the whole market is expanding.",1270198637

Where is the ""fairness""? I purchased the machine specifically because of the multi-function aspect, including being able to run Linux on it. I purchased the games I wished to  play, both from the playstation store and retail.

1236203,comment,1236048,1236169,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"As if the number of servers using IPv6 mattered the slightest. It does not. What matters is the number of IPv6 servers that can talk to <i>all</i> clients. That means IPv4 clients as well (they are the majority, after all).<p>Being connected to the internet means being able to talk to every single machine on that network. If a computer can't talk to IPv4 computers, then it is by definition <i>not</i> connected to the internet.<p>We can't split the network. If we have to do it to switch to IPv6, then it just won't happen. Ever. To avoid splitting the network IPv4 and IPv6 machine have to be able to talk together.<p>So, as long as IPv6 and IPv4 computers can't talk to each other, we will be limited to the back end servers you are talking about. Until we go beyond that point, IPv6 will stay relatively useless.",1270198100

1236199,comment,1235791,1236004,0,0,sailormoon,,,"I find it quite incredible that so many Americans, mostly from SF, report seeing such things, indeed talking about them as if they're a normal part of everyday life. I have lived in a few places, mostly in Australia and Asia, all of them big cities and all of them with significant homeless populations, and have never, ever seen that kind of thing.<p>What is it about American homeless that they lack even the basic human dignity to find a toilet to take a dump in? Or hell, at least a drain or somewhere their shit will wash away? Are they that disconnected from society? Or is it a calculated thing, like vandalism, revenge against a society they hate? It's nuts.<p>Sure, I've seen people shit in public. Once a friend had severe stomach cramps while walking through a park in central Sydney; she rushed into the bushes to relieve the pain. And while I was living around there I regularly saw women (it always seems to be women) crouching over drains in the street outside my apartment. Hey, I understand, when you gotta go, you gotta go, and severe diarrhoea makes people desperate. That's fine. But never with this total lack of dignity and respect that SF residents seem to experience.",1270197889

Good example why you should date your articles. I met with Cisco a couple months ago and they detailed their IPV6 strategy to us from the service provider perspective. In short: They're throwing a bunch of different strategies at the problem to cover all the bases. It's not an elegant solution. More like brute force with a focus on preserving total interoperability. This stuff is already in the wild today on a small scale. It works. Comcast, COX, TWC, etc all have active deployments and are looking at large scale rollouts over the next year.<p><a href=""http://www.ict-partner.net/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6553/white_paper_c11-558744-00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ict-partner.net/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps...</a>",1270197615

If it doesn't even compile (first and third), is it an interesting bug?  Not to me.  The second is slightly less so, but still not very interesting -- any sane combination of compiler flags will emit a warning about this that you'd have to be an idiot to ignore.<p>Though in 10 seconds, finding any ""real"" bugs would be a joke too -- so frankly I don't really see the point.",1270197542

1236188,comment,1235955,1235955,0,0,jsz0,,,"The rise of cable news is probably one of the worst things that has ever happened to this country. It turns news into entertainment and sport. No mystery why Fox News is popular. The echo chamber of cable news has also dragged down the quality/substance of the network news programs as well. That's where the overwhelming majority of people get their TV news. Even newspapers are not immune. It's terrible that this small but rabid viewership of cable news is allowed to have such a disproportionate impact on the entire news industry. I think CNN would be wise to position themselves as a more serious substantive alternative. I don't see how they beat Fox News at entertainment/sport. I'm actually surprised MSNBC hasn't pulled ahead of CNN yet since they indulge in most of the same gimmicks as Fox News. That probably speaks more to the demographics of these rapid cable news junkies.",1270196312

The trouble is that large organisations are too standardized to ever be truly meritocratic. People are generally banded based on perceived ability, but there must be such variation between those in each band, meaning you are rewarding people of varying abilities the same. This type of system is slow and fails to take in to account outliers.",1270196101
1236183,comment,1236048,1236107,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"It could be more pernicious than that: IPv4, because of the potential lack of addresses, is very good at centralizing the network. For instance, most ISPs don't offer it's customers a fixed IP address. It makes installing servers more difficult. Some ISPs even <i>share</i> IP addresses between customers. It makes installing servers <i>impossible</i>. The result is a more centralized network, where you more or less have to blog and mail through big companies' servers.<p>The stakes are very high. A centralized network provides huge opportunities for analysis and targeted advertisement (read: spying and manipulation). IPv6, by providing an internet address to every device on this planet, is a threat to that model. However, clinging to that model is not directly making money from IP addresses, so the ICANN may not be able to do anything about telco dragging their feet.",1270195900

This isn't a problem for SQL, but suppose I select some stuff, get back into the host programming language, fire off some rockets into space from the Kennedy Space Center, and then insert some data about the launch into the database. This is a <i>big</i> problem, because if the insertion fails because of potential conflicts, the <i>whole</i> thing needs to be rolled back (including the rocket launch), and rerun. A lot of software is written to account for this (i.e. don't perform any external state modification you can't roll back until you've confirmed the transaction is committed), but a lot of software isn't. To really have great isolation <i>and</i> performance, you need to write software this way. For people that don't, we'll support serializable level, but there are very strong limitations as to how efficient this can be.",1270195378

1589953,comment,1589650,1589924,0,0,macrael,,,"But I think you are confusing things. There is no question anywhere as to whether people who use more data can be charged more for that use. The fact that most home plans are all you can eat has nothing to do with net neutrality. So in your example, hopefully the security camera company would be charged a higher fee than a competing company who streamed non HD video. Youtube pays a hell of a lot more to hook up to the internet than I do.<p>The question is whether Verizon can charge a separate fee to prioritize one company's traffic over another. My understanding is that this recommendation partially closes that door for wired traffic but leaves it wide open for wireless traffic. Now fledgling startup security video hooks up their cameras to the web and find their bandwidth artificially restricted compared to the entrenched competition because they aren't paying for the super deluxe plan, or because Verizon has an exclusivity agreement with the entrenched player, or whatever. That is what seems to be left possible in wireless land with this recommendation, and that is frightening.",1281398260

1589929,comment,1587389,1589497,0,0,othermaciej,,,"My family lived in Poland when I was young. We ended up leaving when my father was imprisoned for his political activities (he was involved in the Solidarity movement).<p>Two points of comparison I can give:<p>(1) In America, members of my immediate family have political views that are in some way wacky or out of the mainstream, and we've never worried for a second about prison being a consequence.<p>(2) When we first came to America, we were literally on welfare and lived in a poor/ghetto neighborhood, until my parents learned enough English to get good jobs. Yet this was still a much higher standard of living than what we'd had in Poland, where both of my parents worked as engineers. Much larger apartment, more food, better clothes. No more ration cards for meat and chocolate. Stores that, instead of tiny and half-empty, are giant and piled high with goods. Oranges and bananas just lying around in stores as if they are everyday things, not rare exotic luxuries.<p>(3) On health care - there were many extremely well-trained and competent doctors in Poland. But availability of equipment and medicine was very extremely poor and hospitals were not well maintained by US standards. Also, medical knowledge among typical doctors, especially on rare diseases or chronic conditions, seemed far behind the US.<p>(4) I've been back to Poland a few times since the fall of communism. Conditions have very visibly and vastly improved. Apartments are still tiny, but there's plenty of stores piled with goods, bustling cafes and restaurants, and so forth. Construction going on everywhere. Cars are now mostly quality European, America, Japanese and Korean brands. No more Communist-era junkers. Poland now meets the usual European standard of fresh produce that is substantially better quality than what you can get in the typical US supermarket. Western media is everywhere. Many of the cities look quite lively and vibrant. The city that I think most bears the scars of past suffering is Warsaw - it was completely destroyed by the Nazis (particularly including any historic or cultural buildings) and rebuilt by the Communists. Check out the Palace of Culture and Science for another marvel of Soviet engineering: <<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Palace_of_Culture_and_Science>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Palace_of_Culture_and_Sc...</a>.<p>(5) In the US, where I work in the computer industry, I believe I have a higher standard of living overall than probably even the top party leaders in Communist-era Poland.<p>(6) Math and science education was quite good compared to the US, at the elementary and secondary level, but not at the college level. I think this is a European cultural thing, not a Communist thing, it remains true today, and is true in most European countries. American math & science education in elementary school and high school is a joke, excepting special magnet schools or AP classes.<p>(7) My impression is that the Communist era is somewhat more romanticized in Russia than in other former Eastern Bloc countries. Particularly the more Western-oriented countries like Poland, Czech and Hungary see that period as one of being imperialist vassal states.<p>Overall, there's no way, not even the slightest chance, that I'd trade the ""free"" health care and ""non-existent"" unemployment for the freedom and wealth of America, or even for the way Poland is now.",1281397824

1589924,comment,1589650,1589845,0,0,nl,,,"It's possible that in the wireless space tiered access might make sense. I'm not a wireless engineer but my understanding is that wireless access suffers from overcrowding a lot more than wired access simply because the overall bandwith within a given frequency band is a lot lower than a bundle of optical fibers.<p>Given this limitation I think we should be very careful in saying that a given solution should not be allowed. I can imagine scenarios where tiered pricing models would be very beneficial to most people.<p>For example, imagine a business setting up wireless security video cams. Thoughtlessly, they set them up to record and send video in HD. A few of those pointed at a rapidly changing scene (eg, a road) can chew though a lot of bandwidth. The owner of those cams doesn't care - why should they? They just pay a flat rate and the fact that everyone else's access is bad isn't their problem.<p>If an access provider could charge extra for that traffic then it would give the cam owner motivation to fix the problem.<p>(Yes, there are other solutions - a price per Gb of traffic is an obvious one. But my point is that I'm not convinced other options should be outlawed <i>yet</i>)",1281397699

<i>In short, the economy created by the new progressives can pay off only those at the peak of the employment pyramid — top researchers, CEOs, entertainment honchos, highly skilled engineers and programmers. As a result, California suffers from an increasingly bifurcated social structure.</i><p>This is not just a matter of politics, public v. private sector, and the competing vested interests in California. Those socioeconomic factors are all important, but the elephant in the room is that a very high proportion of our wealth derives from computers and software. We have automated away a great deal of what the labor force used to do, so successfully that many industries have pushed unit labor costs down to the level where only developing nations can compete.<p>Outsourcing is generally blamed for the decline in US manufacturing jobs, but I think that's a symptom rather than a cause. If there wasn't a large pool of cheap labor in Asia, then we'd just be seeing more robots in the US, as is the case in Japan to a large extent.<p>Of course the internet has brought all kinds of wonderful new opportunities. But because the key economic benefits are disintermediation and delocalization, the rewards are distributed very differently. Take Amazon - hugely successful company, clear benefit to the consumer, and a good advert for capitalism generally. Jobs at Amazon: warehouse drone, middle manager, engineer, senior manager. I simplify, of course, but what do you think are the chances for a warehouse drone to 'learn the business' and rise up the ranks? Virtually zero unless they study at home, because the warehouse job consists of picking up order slips, scanning things taken off shelves, and putting them in boxes. The inventory management, purchasing, accounting, and analysis aspects are entirely automated, so you're not going to pick up many skills on the job.<p>This isn't just an internet problem. In my supermarket the checkout is not staffed mainly by people whose job is recite scripts written by the marketing department and to make sure I'm not stealing anything. They wave barcoded products over a laser scanner and announce a total. All the price-checking, calculation and cash dispensing is carried out by a computer, and the job doesn't even require accurate data entry. The job requires so little that it doesn't pay much, and there's no real room for improvement, skill development, or competition. There's no opportunity to become the most efficient and accurate checkout operator; and it demands so little competence that getting fired is nearly impossible. So if you're tired of stacking shelves, don't hold your breath waiting for a chance to try life as a checkout clerk. You could occupy your thoughts with examining what goods sell best in which shelf positions, but display management is largely automated these days as well. You just scan the wholesale box and your scanning wand tells you which shelf section to put the inventory on today.<p>Work as a mechanic? Well, a lot of modern engines are just black boxes now, and your job is about running diagnostics and then either resetting the firmware or ordering whatever the manufacturer's website says you need. Clerical work/bookkeeping? Greatly reduced - spreadsheets take care of all the arithmetic, and even the data entry is increasingly automated. As we all know, writing is a good deal easier with a computer than a typewriter, and there's been a corresponding decline in the importance of writing ability, accuracy in spelling and grammar, and handwriting. For many people now, the most complex tasks they perform at home are operating the microwave and assembling Ikea furniture. Earning a living now requires either long hours in low paying jobs or long hours of study and professional commitment for well-paying ones, so for a lot of people housework and DIY are necessities to be minimized - there isn't the same time or economic freedom to develop ancillary skills for their own sake.<p>So it's not just how we divide the income or the taxes. It's how we divide the work too.",1281397679

Lots of materials science, solar cells, OLEDs, etc, but basically nothing about internet technology...<p>... so we started one.  The club's new Startup Engine series is going to grab trending topics on Hacker News and pull together a panel on them.  Get panelists to answer three questions about a particular topic: what's happened in the past 6 months?; what do we think will happen?; and how should you get involved?  Get meaningful advice from practitioners.<p>First up is mobile applications:<p>* http://www.mitcnc.org/stateofmobile<p>* August 19, 6:30PM in SF (KickLabs, 4 blocks from CalTrain)<p>*  On the panel: Google, Appcelerator, Bump Tech, Dropbox<p>Second up in October is probably: the State of Databases (e.g. NoSQL)?

1589805,comment,1589467,1589467,0,0,photon_off,,,"Here's my honest opinion; it might be a little discouraging, but don't worry, I'm just some kid typing stuff on the internet.<p>First, let's discuss the aesthetics of the site.  The site looks like a real start-up website, and I immediately classify it as ""something I should look into"" rather than ""spam"", ""boring"", etc.  So, that's good.<p>I didn't like the ""feed"" of searches that is the primary focus of the page.  Since your summary didn't adequately explain to me what your service does (well, technically it did, but I just didn't ""get"" it), this stream of searches was rather confusing.  They were all from several hours ago, by people who I'm not the least bit interested in, had no comments, and everytime I would think about clicking on anything it would abruptly move as the next equally annoying search thing faded in.  Also, it's buggy as hell.  It looks somewhat nice, but doesn't show off anything of value.  Rather, it makes your site look like a ghost town.  Sign up for a ghost town?  No thanks.<p>I would suggest to populate your site with some interesting content (even if you have to fake making users to do it), and show me the most interesting discussions.  That would get me interested:  ""Wow! People are actually discussing stuff that others are searching for!""  Rather than ""Uh, a stream of mundane searches?  All several hours old, in no apparent order, with no comments...  what's the point of this?""<p>Another thing I noticed is that I kept wanting to scroll up, thinking that the color horizontal bar was cut off content.  While this was just a minor annoyance, it was still annoying.  I also felt lost, and somewhat betrayed, when what looked like the major navigation of the site was actually adwords.<p>Now, let's talk about the idea.  I don't feel like you're creating something that people want.  I'm not the world's best Googler, but 99% of the time I manage to find what I'm looking for.  The other 1%, I'll try on other search engines, or ask people on FB, whatever.  I also use <a href=""http://www.moreofit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moreofit.com</a> (shameless plug) to search for things if I already have one good example of what I'm looking for.  So, your site is not likely to help me find things.<p>Now, are my search queries something I want as a point of conversation?  Generally, no.  I could only imagine this being useful in some sort of SEO forum where I'm interested in the rankings of the results... in which case I'd just create a new thread in that forum.<p>I'm not convinced at all that ""search queries"" are a topic people want to talk about.  Even if it were the world's most amazing point of conversation, why would I use your site to discuss my search queries rather than the thousands of other already-established and populated commenting systems online?  Why not just post a status update on facebook, or twitter, or post on a forum I frequent, or Reddit, HN, etc?<p>I just think to myself... of all the things that one would want to talk about online, is ""search query"" really at all popular?  And, if so, what technological benefit does your site have that makes me want to talk about ""search queries"" at your site, rather than on any other of 1000 forums?  It's such an absurd concept that in retrospect it's the reason why I didn't ""get"" what your site did.<p>If you could show off some examples of interesting discussions centered around search queries and put them on the frontpage, I might have a completely different opinion, and maybe a ""search query enthusiast"" niche could be cultivated.",1281395121

Probably starting somewhere around $20 for the smallest budgets, and going up from there. We'll set the tier price points wherever there seems to be obvious market segmentation.<p>Really big power users, or agencies who are white-labeling our product, might get a more industry-standard percent-of-spend deal.<p>Our view is that Mom-and-Pops might be wary of a percent-of-spend pricing model. That said, the small SEM shops of dubious quality, who are our real competition, commonly use a percent-of-spend pricing model. So we might have to go with that just to make it comparable. Even if that were true, we'd charge nowhere near the 15-20% of spend many SEM shops charge.<p>So, worry not. You're not going to get used to our product, and then get screwed by us on price.

Heres a quote from the wikipedia page for Standard Oil - ""The company grew by increasing sales and also through acquisitions. After purchasing competing firms, Rockefeller shut down those he believed to be inefficient and kept the others. In a seminal deal, in 1868, the Lake Shore Railroad, a part of the New York Central, gave Rockefeller's firm a going rate of one cent a gallon or forty-two cents a barrel, an effective 71% discount off of its listed rates in return for a promise to ship at least 60 carloads of oil daily and to handle the loading and unloading on its own.[citation needed] Smaller companies decried such deals as unfair because they were not producing enough oil to qualify for discounts.""",1281395082

Of course you should do some warm up sets at lower weights for each lift to avoid injury and work on form.<p>The advise from the book has worked pretty well for me.  I started as a complete novice in April, and I am now lifting around 1.5 times bodyweight on the squat and the deadlift.  (The other lifts have also progress nicely.)<p>I should do more pullups.

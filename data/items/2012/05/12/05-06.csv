3962940,comment,3962292,3962764,13,0,achompas,,,"I really think you have it right: negotiate the release. Firing a month before OP's first year of equity vests is an incredibly low move. It's also suggested (and arguably correct) that OP might have legal recourse (the ""option"") if the company makes it big (which is why founders want OP to sign a release).<p>They don't want a mess if things get big, so OP has little to lose by offering this deal. There's a good chance the founders accept, too, since (a) they're high on their company's prospects, given their thriftiness with equity, and (b) negative press always sucks, and exercising the ""option"" would generate negative press.<p>I'll disagree, though, and say OP should ask for 11 months of vesting--that's what OP earned, after all. It'd be harder to get that extra month, given that OP wasn't there for a full year and the founders have worked to hang onto as much equity as possible.<p>EDIT: <i>Consult with a lawyer when attempting to negotiate.</i> A lawyer can help you get through the process while avoiding any suggestion of extortion, blackmail, etc. (which, unintended or otherwise, will torpedo you and ruin your rep).",1336802347

Why don't you (politely) email them that you are a reasonable person and believe it fairness. You don't expect full cliff vesting per agreement, but a 3.5 month compensation is simply <i>not</i> fair. Counter them something like 8 months worth of equity + expense report. Project a tone that you are reasonable and professional about it, but out of personal principle, you will <i>fight</i> against unfair offers.<p>Give them a hint (but don't say you are talking to a lawyer) that if the arrangement is unreasonable, you'll not just walk away. You'll spend the time and energy to right the wrongs. Give them hints that investors, public laundry, and/or legal means are within consideration (but don't do any of these yet) -- even at the expense of potentially not getting anything at all.<p>I think if the founders are serious about continuing with the startup, they'll think twice about this. What you are asking them is to just be reasonable, so they shouldn't have a problem with it. They would be far more worried about all these things you hint at (investors, public laundry, legal means).<p>If they counter with something -- say 6 months. Take it. Heck, if you do this correctly, you lose no karma, not even the relationship with them.<p>BTW the equity... probably worthless anyway. So, the other approach is to simply move on.

You can't just take the circumstances that women face in tech fields, and switch around the pronouns and have the circumstances make sense, because doing so does not swap out the cultural contexts which reside <i>in the reader's head</i> (which is one of the critical points in the veil of ignorance thought experiment: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance</a> ).<p>There are female dominated fields in which men are rare (nursing and dietetics to name two) and encounter all sort of social awkwardness due to being the minority.

3962874,story,,,1,0,brewerhimself,"Questions and concerns about moving to California for school",,"Im 19, I did 2 years of university (with little success) in Canada, and Im battling the decision of whether I want to go back to school or not. The way I see it, I have 3 options:<p>+ Dont go back to school. Work a steady job making a decent living until I manage to get a job as a software developer.<p>+ Go to a community college here in Florida and eventually transfer to a university to complete my computer science degree.<p>+ Move to California (in the Bay Area) and attend community college there, eventually transferring to a UC school to complete my computer science degree.<p>Each of these options has its own merits in my opinion:<p>+ The decision to not go back to school would allow me to work full time, make a decent living, and focus on becoming a better programmer. The downside would be the difficulty that I would have finding a job for lack of a formal post-secondary education.<p>+ Staying here in Florida means I would qualify for in-state tuition, which would make things cheaper for me. Id be near my mom if I needed any help and Id get to continue to live at the beach. On the flip side, there isnt a huge software industry where Im at. I have yet to meet anyone who shares my passion for developing software and this can make it hard to stay motivated.<p>+ Moving to the valley would put me in a place where I can meet many like-minded people who share my enthusiasm and passion for technology. Graduating from a CCC would guarantee me a spot in a number of UC schools -- with the exception of Berkeley and UCLA, I believe. The only thing stopping me from doing this is that I would have to pay out-of-state tuition and I honestly dont know if I could afford to do that. I already have $30,000 in student loans.<p>If I had my pick, I would move to California. I feel a need to be in the hub where everyone is doing things that are interesting and cool. The computer science programs are larger in California and the school I would end up at if I stayed in Florida (University of Florida) is making a major change to its computer science program that appears to be for the worse.<p>Here are a few questions I would be grateful for if someone could address:<p>+ Obviously, the major issue is money. I could probably save $5,000+ if I took a year off before moving to the Valley, but that would only go so far. My cost-of-attendance for a CCC is approx $22,000 and I think Im eligible for ~$7,000 in need-based scholarships and grants. That leaves about $15,000 that I would need to somehow come up with. What are my options? I know of Stafford loans and Id be willing to take out the most I can if it means getting a fantastic education and being in a prime networking spot, but what else can I do?<p>+ Are there many part-time jobs for computer science students in California? The minimum wage is $8/hr -- just under $1,300/mn before taxes. That would barely be enough to live on here and the rent in San Francisco is significantly higher. If I move then I want to be able to make it on my own. What are my options here? Are there software firms that employ students part-time during the school year (internships included)?<p>+ In your opinion, would moving to California for school be a good idea, seeing as I want to start my career in the Valley? Opinions backed by experience will certainly carry the most weight here.<p>I have a real passion for software and I want to be around people who share these feelings, which is not something readily available where I am now. Im open to any additional thoughts, concerns, or tips that HN has to offer.",1336800501

If you can afford it a lawyer is a good idea.  It doesn't hurt your relationship with your other founders. They clearly consulted lawyers before letting you go which is why they are asking you for a release.  On the other hand don't just use the lawyers to communicate with the other founders but do use them to understand your rights and your situation.  Your co-founders should respect you even more if you stand up for what you believe in and what you are owed.  It may be painful in the short term but generally I find people respect those who stand up for themselves.  If they are asking for a release you have leverage and I don't think it is a big stretch to ask for your 12 months.  One thing to discuss with lawyers is what were the terms of your offer letter.  Was their acceleration?  Are they trying to terminate you for cause?  If so this is really hard to prove in California and its unlikely they would try to do so.\nFinally on the expenses if you have the receipts submit them its another item in your favor.\nIn the end there is often a lot more to these stories than it seems so I am sure there is a lot more going on, but if you keep a cool head and focus on getting to something that is fair you can close this chapter and move on to your next with the knowledge that you got what you deserved and learned some valuable lessons",1336800440

There are two opinions on this issue that are backed by large numbers of people.  One saying inequality increases with our current system and the other confirming that but saying our system ""lifts all boats"" making the poor richer while it makes the rich even more so.<p>I have no problem with debating that point.<p>But this article cites no actual facts.  Not even from his opponents.  He cites ""reports from think tanks"" but rather than presenting facts from those reports and refuting them he attacks the people making the points (calling them ""obfuscators"")<p>More importantly he doesn't spell out a thought process.  Plenty of people write interesting opinion pieces without hard facts by spelling out their thought process and asking people to consider it when they see hard facts in the future.  But that's not what this is and I'd offer his last paragraph as proof of that...<p>""The larger answer, however, is that extreme concentration of income is incompatible with real democracy. Can anyone seriously deny that our political system is being warped by the influence of big money, and that the warping is getting worse as the wealth of a few grows ever larger?""<p>By saying  ""can anyone seriously deny"" he's not laying out his thought process he's simply trying to bully people with an opposing thought process by saying they're fools if they don't agree with him (they may very well be fools but it's unproductive and of no value to tell them that without an explanation of why they're fools)<p>So I go back to my original point.  How does this ""gratify anyone's intellectual curiosity"" as the guidelines say?",1320602316

3203311,comment,3203228,3203228,1,0,Swizec,,,"IANAL, but an option to consider is going to the US for the 3 months a tourist visa allows you. You can use this time to look for work and there shouldn't be any problems as long as you don't actually work ... and there shouldn't be any real problems even if you do work but that's highly illegal and I did not suggest you do anything like that.<p>A loophole exists however. You can open a business in the UK that does consulting for the US job so technically you are employed in the UK and are staying in the US on an extended business trip. These can legally last up to something like 6 months (I think). This should give you enough time to come up with a proper solution.<p>The consulting thing is how developers are usually employed in my neck of Europe because it enables a lot of tax tricks and is generally easier for people. And while this scenario is battle tested for remote work, I am not sure how it actually goes over when you also relocate to the US.<p>Take all of this with a grain of salt, consult with an immigration lawyer before you do anything.",1320602263

3203257,comment,3202255,3202255,3,0,ScottBurson,,,"Historical note: the Lisp Machines had true incremental collection, supported by microcode and hardware.  Words in memory had a tag field, and a certain value of the tag field indicated that the word was ""GC-forwarded"".  When the GC moved an object (it was a copying collector) it would leave behind these GC-forward pointers in each word of the old location of the object, pointing to the corresponding word of the new location.  Subsequent references to one of the old words would automatically indirect to the new one -- note that this is an indirection triggered by the contents of <i>memory</i>, not by an explicit instruction.  The point was, it was no longer necessary to find all references to the old location and update them just to move one object.  (The GC algorithm guaranteed that all references to old objects would be updated eventually, so that the space could be actually reclaimed.)<p>It's hard to do this without hardware support, and even harder on a multiprocessor.  Still, I do recall seeing a paper presenting a fully incremental GC with a very short maximum-pause guarantee.  The problem was (IIRC) that it made such heavy use of CAS (compare-and-swap) instructions that the overhead of these would be unacceptable.<p>I wonder how much effort Intel and AMD have been putting into making CAS faster.",1320601083

Yes, he got the thing working and it even performed decently but he was irritated that if he really stuck with the paradigm of not having alterable state, some small changes to his app's functionality would entail changes in all kinds of places in the source.<p>Happily, Clojure gives you explicitly alterable state and a bucketload of mechanisms for working with those.

3203250,comment,3202255,3202255,5,0,gizmo,,,"> What language systems in existence are using a true incremental or concurrent garbage collector? I know of three: Java, Objective C 2.0 (which just shipped with OS X Leopard), and the .net runtime. Not Haskell. Not Erlang. Not Objective Caml. [...], not Smalltalk not Ruby.<p>Oh, why could that possibly be. Hmm...<p>- Java: Sun<p>- Objective C: Apple<p>- .Net: Microsoft<p>Big companies with the manpower and determination to make improvements to their platforms. All the other languages have either grown out of one-man prototypes or academic projects. Building a good garbage collector is <i>hard</i>. It's difficult because you can't keep track of much data while you're allocating, you can't walk the graph of allocated objects because different threads are modifying the graph while you're working on it. When you then add a constraint that you can never stop the world for more than 5ms at the time it becomes a Difficult Problem.<p>Languages like Ruby, Python, Lisp and Scheme don't have good generational garbage collectors because they don't have the manpower to tackle Difficult Problems. (See for instance the global interpreter lock in Python. It's been 10 years now?)<p>To tackle a Difficult Problem you need (a) a few smart people and (b) get them to work on the problem for many consecutive hours for many consecutive days. Volunteers just can't afford to spend 50+ hours a week for half a year on a problem. A hundred people can chip in weekends and evenings for a year and make no substantial progress at all.<p>This is completely different from the hypothetical ""sufficiently smart compiler"" that is supposed to sense the intent of the programmer and optimize accordingly. A sufficiently smart compiler cannot compensate for bad algorithm design, so the performance differences will always be in the margins. The state-of-the-art in terms of garbage collection is decades ahead of what we see in Python, Ruby, Haskell, Scheme and so forth. The GC problem is simple: spread the computational overhead of garbage collection evenly so that the application doesn't stutter. Simple engineering problem with a concrete and clear goal. Just difficult to implement.",1320600981

They argued that there are two essential behavioural differences between the sexes:<p>1. Women tend to have more intimate social networks than men. (Fewer people, stronger connections).<p>2. In almost every aspect of life, women tend to deviate less from the mean. For better and often for worse, men are bigger risk takers.<p>This second point I find really interesting. Lots of statistical gender differences can be explained by this one fact. Apparently, if you plot male and female behavioural patterns on just about any scale (income, crime, exam marks, etc), women cluster around the mean more than men.<p>Some of the effects of this:<p>- There are more men in prison.<p>- More men run big companies.<p>- Statistically, girls do better at high school. This is because the dropout guys bring the mean mark down more than the high achievers bring it up.<p>The best evolutionary justification I've heard is that humans were polygamous for large periods of our evolution.

Since Im European, I had no expectations that it would have led to a full-time job, given the hassle of getting an H1B visa (in fact, I was already surprised that the company sponsored my J-1 for the length of the internship).<p>After just a few weeks, the company was impressed with my performance (they told me I had already accomplished more than they expected from the whole three months) and they gave me a full-time offer. Compensation, option, benefits, visa paperwork, all there.\nI took some time to decide, as I was considering other opportunities, and eventually accepted.<p>My girlfriend is American (we met in the UK, where we both did our masters), and this was the best opportunity to keep living with her, with a nice, well-payed job in a cool town in the US.\nShe stopped arranging for a post-study work visa in the UK. I refused opportunities with Google, Bing, and two startups. I told all those people I wasnt able to consider any offer, since I had already accepted one (so I thought).<p>The last day of my internship we made the last arrangements for my return.\nI had a conversation with the main engineer, who also mentioned that the company could request a green card for me after a few years on the H1B.

He added that they expected something more from the last part of my internship.<p>Im shocked.<p>No one ever gave me a hint that I was doing something wrong. The founder himself had called me several times to show the prototype I was developing to investors.<p>I cannot stress how unfortunate this is for me.

It doesnt necessarily have to be a startup, I will go for a big corporation if that makes it easier to obtain a visa.\nIm also interested in any subtleties regarding visas: is there a way I can come back as a tourist and apply for jobs?

The great lesson here is that it make sense for a 'vision' to remain unattainable so that in the process of working hard to get to this infinite destination you'll eventually become a great force to reckon with because you would have gone through every needed obstacle; and whilst your mission may undergo momentary changes the vision should remain sacrosanct for several generations to witness and reference to the next generation.<p>Instance 2:\nGoogle, Inc.

Ask Netscape and its ghost what Microsoft did to them during the dot-com days.<p>Lessons 7:\nLearn early to build your product to look totally different and try as much to pretend to be pursuing something different until you are huge enough to fight the giants...at that time you are already in the same club, so you must have grasps every rudiment inherent.

""Just like a man can never 'love' more one woman at a time"", so it is with entrepreneurs starting out with so many products.<p>Lessons 9:\nThere is wisdom in keeping a single or fewer products that you can manage effectively...you will grow fasting when you do few things and become a winner rather than keeping multiple products that could pose a great problem of poor focus.<p>Instance 9:\nStarbucks Inc. & Apple Inc.<p>Business Rule No.10:\nKeep your young business far away from experts for as long as you can, they are ironic pessimist and their theories in most cases are likely to impede innovation...experts are conventionalist that believe firmly in anything status-quo. And innovation means 'breaking conventional rules to disrupt faded games'.<p>Lessons 10:\nUse the fund you are supposed to allocate to experts to hire group of crazy young free thinkers and give them the mandate to legitimately destroy conventional rules at sight with the power of crazy imagination.<p>Instance 10:\nHenry Ford (Ford Motors), Steve Jobs (Apple), Sam Walton (Wal-Mart)<p>Supplementary Business Advice:\nIf you are starting a new business Ill advice you focus much attention, ideas and energy on developing the product first, business plans can come later...business plans cum profitability urge are some of the greatest distraction to building appealing products. Let your product design determine the kind of business strategy to create or adopt and not the reverse. But above all keep your product as simple as possible....that is, kill all levels of complexities so that it appeals to the lowest leveled user out there!<p>Business Rule & Lessons Conclusion:\nAt the end of what you may call retirement from active business make sure that you've served the human race positively by solving parts of the most challenging problems around and if it is done meritoriously the same system will evolve rewards that comes with wealth, fame, and power that may outlast generations.\nMy special appreciation goes to my business idols the late Steve Jobs (Founder, Apple Computers), Henry Ford (Founder, Ford Motors), Ray Kroc (Re-founder, McDonald), Sir Samuel Adedoyin (Founder, Doyin Group Nigeria), Soichiro Honda (Founder, Honda Motors), Richard Branson (Founder, Virgin Group), Jack Dorsey (Creator, Twitter & Square).<p>*JOEL OKAMA YAKUBU (THE NEXT GREAT CEO @ SILICON VALLEY), I'm actually looking for two programmers to join me as co-founders in my new internet project, I'm specifically looking for people that believe in achieving great things in life in the midst of tough challenges, I'm blessed with ideas and I have co-created two products in the past with a partner and this will be my third project.

The problem at the moment is that the world still works in JavaScript, not CoffeeScript.<p>He rightly draws the analogy between jQuery and JS. I spend a lot of my time working on jQuery core, and we have definitely seen the phenomenon described in that blog. Five years ago when jQuery was created, just about every web developer knew JS quite well and understood the quirks of every browser and JS implementation. Now, they just assume that if something doesn't work consistently in IE6 then it must be a jQuery bug, because you know, <i>jQuery is cross browser</i>. People are now programming in jQuery and have given up on JavaScript.<p>If you're a CoffeeScript pioneer you don't see this. You already know the hard and ugly JS things that CS makes easy and beautiful, just like the early jQuery adopters. A few years from now if browsers haven't created native CS implementations but CS is popular, novice programmers will be dealing with the same jQuery-vs-JS dilemma.

I had worked at companies who had to take their system offline when they had the greatest exposure - like getting massive load from the Yahoo front page (back in the day). Citrusleaf focuses on monitoring, integration with monitoring software, operations. We call ourselves a real-time database because we've focused on predictable performance (and very high performance).<p>We don't have as many features as mongo. You can't do a javascript/json long running batch job. We'll get around  to features - right now we're focused on uptime and operational efficiency. Our customers are in digital advertising, where they have 50,000 transactions per second on terabyte datasets (see us at ad:tech in NYC this coming week).<p>Here's a performance analysis we did: <a href=""http://bit.ly/rRlq9V"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/rRlq9V</a><p>This theory that ""mongo is designed to run on in-memory data sets"" is, frankly, terrible --- simply because mongo doesn't give you the control to keep you in memory. You don't know when you're going to spill out of memory. There's no way to ""timeout"" a page cache IO. There's no asynchronous interface for page IO. For all of these reasons - and our internal testing showing page IO is 5x slower than aio; the reason all professional databases use aio and raw devices - we coded Citrusleaf using normal multithreaded io strategies.<p>With Citrusleaf, we do it differently, and that difference is huge. We keep our indexes in memory. Our indexes are the most efficient anywhere - more objects, fea. You configure Citrusleaf with the amount of memory you want to use, and apply policies when you start flowing out of memory. Like not taking writes. Like expiring the least-recently-used data.<p>That's an example of our focus on operations. If your application use pattern changes, you can't have your database go down, or go so slowly as to be nearly unusable.<p>Again, take my comments with a grain of salt, but with Citrusleaf you'll have great uptime, fewer servers, a far less complex installation. Sure, it's not free, but talk to us and we'll find a way to make it work for your project.",1320599881

I had worked at companies who had to take their system offline when they had the greatest exposure - like getting massive load from the Yahoo front page (back in the day). Citrusleaf focuses on monitoring, integration with monitoring software, operations. We call ourselves a real-time database because we've focused on predictable performance (and very high performance).<p>We don't have as many features as mongo. You can't do a javascript/json long running batch job. We'll get to features.<p>The global R/W lock does limit mongo. Absolutely. Our testing shows a nearly 10x difference in performance between Mongo and Citrusleaf on writes. Frankly, if you're still doing 1,000 tps, you should probably stick with a decent MySQL implementation.<p>Here's a performance analysis we did:\n<a href=""http://bit.ly/rRlq9V"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/rRlq9V</a><p>This theory that ""mongo is designed to run on in-memory data sets"" is, frankly, terrible --- simply because mongo doesn't give you the <i>control</i> to keep you in memory. You don't know when you're going to spill out of memory. There's no way to ""timeout"" a page cache IO. There's no asynchronous interface for page IO. For all of these reasons - and our internal testing showing page IO is 5x slower than aio; the reason all professional databases use aio and raw devices - we coded Citrusleaf using normal multithreaded io strategies.<p>With Citrusleaf, we do it differently, and that difference is huge. We keep our indexes in memory. Our indexes are the most efficient anywhere - more objects, fea. You configure Citrusleaf with the amount of memory you want to use, and apply policies when you start flowing out of memory. Like not taking writes. Like expiring the least-recently-used data.<p>That's an example of our focus on operations. If your application use pattern changes, you can't have your database go down, or go so slowly as to be nearly unusable.<p>Again, take my comments with a grain of salt, but with Citrusleaf you'll have better uptime, fewer servers, a far less complex installation. Sure, it's not free, but talk to us and we'll find a way to make it work for your project.",1320599252

First it says that the ""UTC is the time in England minus the day light savings time"", which is technically correct, however it's a bad metaphore to give, especially to people in UK. There are many who think ""GMT includes daylight sayings time"", and so ""UTC = Time in England"" can make people think that UTC includes daylight savings.<p>It's also very simplistic to say that a city is on UTC plus/minus X hours, <i>because</i> daylight savings time messes that up. It's much easier to use tzdata format such as ""America/Houston"", and use a library that uses the tzdata database. Then you never have to worry about when Houston changes from UTC-6 to UTC-5.

You don't want to spend time learning how you need to configure your server when you'd rather prepare for your meeting with that client.And importantly, you have something to fall back on if it doesn't work out.<p>2. Get enough people to take you seriously. I mean really, work on open source, maintain a blog, attend hackathons etc. Build a decent enough profile that another developer would recommend to someone.<p>3. If possible, get paid while you pick up these and many other vital skills. You'll learn a lot on the job and clear your bills. Of course, make sure you're sincere enough to focus on 1 and 2.<p>Young and relatively inexperienced programmer here.

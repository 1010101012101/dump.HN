It checks what he thinks is right, and mixes formatting checks with syntax checks.<p>JSHint is a small improvement, it allows you to switch off rules that Crockford doesn&#x27;t even want to talk about, but apart from that it&#x27;s not a great step forward. Plus, for no good reason at all they decided to rename some of the rules from JSLint, and switch some of the flags, so that sometimes &quot;true&quot; means enforce something, something it means refuse it.

I took some risks by choosing them but thought it could be worth it.<p>For the big company i had to go with java spring mvc + sencha, they didn&#x27;t want to hear of any new tech that would be different from what they were used to. They deployed it in their own infra.<p>Now, the start up project took 3 man month, the big company took more than 7, and a year total before being deployed.\nThe startup only paid an intern to maintain the software,and almost nothing in infrastructure fees. The big company outsourced maintenance to a software service company that proved unable to do even the most basic troubleshooting.<p>I designed and coded the two systems, and i wasn&#x27;t a guru of any specific tech, so it&#x27;s not an issue with the people.

The probability is the same for a modestly-sized group eating a regular diet over the same timespan. Is the morbidity caused by Soylent? Is it caused by a regular diet? Is it caused by uncontrolled variables, or random chance?<p>In an uncontrolled environment, it would be extremely difficult to establish a causal link between Soylent consumption and a particular health outcome, even if that health outcome were so radically more or less prevalent in the Soylent group vs. the general population that it was actually noticed as a trend and people went looking for it.<p>But it&#x27;s far likelier that, if Soylent consumption were associated with a particular health outcome, the trend wouldn&#x27;t be so clear-cut or obvious as to stand out outside of a controlled environment, and people wouldn&#x27;t go looking for it.

If Alice&#x27;s restaurant could handle 5,000,000 covers a night with only 1 member of staff while Zola&#x27;s restaurant could only handle 10,000 then you&#x27;d have a more realistic scenario to compare with the SaaS industry. The benefit of &quot;complexity&quot; is that you are able to do more things with less work.<p>The ideal is to build powerful systems from small, simple processes - if any single stage is trivial then anyone can understand it, fix it, modify it, and so on. With many little processes working together you can do amazing things. A good example in software is a build process - a good system can lint code, test it, uglify it, minify it, push it to version control, watch for changes, reload an output mechanism, clean up a distribution, and push it to a live server if it&#x27;s working all from a single command.

84378,comment,83930,83930,0,0,brianmckenzie,,,"I think Doctorow overstates the awkwardness of ignoring a friend request. People do it all the time, I know I do, and I've <i>never</i> accepted a 'top friends' request.<p>There's a hidden benefit if people use the 'ignore' feature properly: you get a better idea of who your friends are. Someone ignoring a friend request can be very telling.",1196278862

84370,comment,83930,83979,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Easy. Facebook was seen as the in thing on campus. If you had a Facebook profile, you were hip and cool and cutting edge. After a few months in 2004 it got to the point that not having a profile meant people simply forgot who you were (because they couldn't read your profile like they could everyone elses). Obviously it influenced none of your close friends, but people you just met would judge you by your profile and decide whether or not to include you in the future.<p>It was also a great way to find your friend's hot friends and set up a meeting somehow.<p>The fact you had to give them your college email address and a password was no barrier. Heck, not having to choose a user name or design your profile yourself made it <i>easier</i> to sign up.<p>(I can answer this since I was in college at the time it got started.)",1196277375

I'm very glad that Google, with its brains & money, is going into the power business -- but I'm not going to get excited over a press release saying that someday somehow they might make clean power cheaper than coal. I'm waiting for some real results.",1196276720

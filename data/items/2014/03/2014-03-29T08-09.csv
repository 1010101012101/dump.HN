Start building stuff and getting to know people. Look around the internet for books and study your ass off. Maybe move to a college town that has a lot of cs grads and start meeting them/dropping in on cs classes.<p>Think of it this way; You get to save a boatload on student loans while also giving yourself a lot more time to study/create cool things. In my opinion it will also make you more independent and in turn stronger because you won&#x27;t have your hand held like most college students.<p>College isn&#x27;t for everyone but it can, at times, be a much tougher path to start down on. No matter what you decide is right for you though, the number one thing you should be doing is BUSTING YOUR ASS studying/creating things(I really can&#x27;t say this enough). There is no point in making your future harder by being lazy in a time of struggle and uncertainty.<p>So get to it and best of luck!",1396083576

Try fetching electronic document from 50 years ago. What? You don&#x27;t have tape reading machine? You are not even sure which format it is in? Oops.

I&#x27;m actually curious to see how long it would take to fall back down to 0. Mentioning reddit is a good way to get downvotes (as you can see) especially if you highlight this community&#x27;s insistence on just how much better it is than reddit. Using &quot;low/no-content&quot; comments is another good way. That&#x27;s how we distinguish our memes from everyone else&#x27;s: everyone else&#x27;s &quot;don&#x27;t contribute to the discussion.&quot; As if our own memes were somehow high art and reddit&#x27;s the lowest of brows.<p>Of course, my account is more than a year old.

While it would be unlikely that someone has overridden them given that they are core String and Fixnum methods, it is perfectly possible.  E.g:<p><pre><code>  class String;\n\n    alias :old :*\n\n    def * right\n      $store ||= []\n      $store << self\n      old(right)\n    end\n  end\n\n\n  &quot;foo&quot; * 5\n  &quot;bar&quot; * 3\n\n  p $store\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, even with seemingly innocent calls like that, it takes extra work to be able to reuse that memory without a full GC pass. It&#x27;s certainly not <i>impossible</i>, but it&#x27;s not there yet.<p>So I agree with you in principle, but this is one of those areas where the malleability of Ruby objects makes it tricky to optimize.<p>(one possible example approach is to set aside a bit to indicate &quot;has at least once been stored somewhere where it can escape&quot; as &quot;poor mans escape analysis&quot; - if your object is only ever stored in local variables that have no been captured by a lambda, or passed as arguments, then it can&#x27;t escape higher than where it was created, and so you can take shortcuts, otherwise you&#x27;d still need a full gc pass)",1396082089

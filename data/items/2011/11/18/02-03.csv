Great idea eh?<p>The problem was, just about all the recruiters & employers I talked to about it (in Australia) weren't that positive.  Their reasons were:\n* network effects - it only becomes useful once plenty of candidates were in it.\n* many recruiters already had their own database of candidates that they didn't want to share or duplicate.\n* many recruiters needed near immediate response (they had 48hrs to fill a role). Waiting for candidates to respond to a request was a negative for them.\n* some recruiters saw it as a threat and didn't want to support that kind of system.\n* Companies often wanted a full service solution so while this could generate a quality shortlist for them, many wanted hand holding.<p>HR is ripe for disruption but execution is everything.

3250307,comment,3248551,3248551,2,0,mdasen,,,"I see that Vidyard has also increased their pricing.<p>Three months back, Vidyard was offering unlimited videos on their Venti plan (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2913255"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2913255</a>).  Today, they're only offering 100 videos and the price has gone up from $50/mo to $249/mo.  If this is a tool mostly to be used for short videos, it seems a tad on the expensive side now.  If one assumes a file size of 100MB and 100 videos, that's only 10GB costing a couple dollars in storage each month.  Even the 101GB of transfer is only around $15.<p>I understand how it would be difficult to offer unlimited video hosting (as I brought up three months ago).  As a curiosity (if someone from the team is here), what changed?<p>Assuming the same 100MB file size, that means that Vimeo Pro is offering about 2TB of transfer per month and 50GB of storage (enough for 500 videos) for under $20/mo.  In case you're wondering about the math: Vimeo offers 250,000 plays per year which comes out to over 20,000 per month and with 100MB per play you get 2TB in transfer per month.  Are you finding that the average video is larger than 100MB?  Of course, if the file size is larger, the extra bandwidth used would mean Vidyard would be offering fewer viewings of it.  If the video is 500MB, the 101GB of transfer Vidyard offers would only allow 202 people to watch it in that month while Vimeo Pro would allow 20,000 people to watch without overage charges - plus, even at the 500MB file size, the 50GB of storage would still offer space for 100 videos like Vidyard.<p>If I sound critical, I'm sorry.  If Vidyard isn't about storing and serving videos as much as it is about real-time analytics and integration with services like YouTube, that's just what I need to hear.  I'm genuinely curious.",1321583353

Marco compared it negatively to Netflix, but Prime is $6.50 a month and the streaming stuff is just a small part (it was actually added on after--Prime was a good deal before any streaming content). Complaining about free streaming content is not a great way to start a review. How's the streaming content that Apple provides?<p>The size and weight are great, the iPad feels bulky after using the Fire. It's great for reading while holding in one hand, something I don't do much with the iPad because of it's size and weight.<p>I'm not sure why hardware volume buttons would help much, the software controls are always one tap away. I'm not a fan of the only physical button (power)--it's small and on the bottom, but I'm probably just used to the one on the upper right of iOS devices.<p>It's two days old, there isn't a lot of software written for it yet. That's not surprising since most developers just got theirs two days ago. The app experience on iPad wasn't great at first either, remember all the double sized iPhone apps? The focus of the Fire isn't apps, it's Amazon's content. Remember when it was announced and people were guessing whether or not Apps would even be allowed?<p>It's easy to use, arrives configured (and personalized--the Fire knowing who I am when I opened it was a lot better than the ""plug into iTunes"" message my iPad(s) came with) and seamlessly hooks into the Amazon ecosystem.

It seems they didn't like being viewed as frauds and their users being told by LiveDrive not to give them credit card information!<p>Dear [Full Name],<p>We are writing to you in regards to the recent action taken by LiveDrive to close your backup/briefcase account.<p>Backify used to be a reseller for LiveDrive.com's services. Recently we were having some issues with their serive and they were literally unable to provide a solution to our problems. More information about these issues can be read on our homepage at www.backify.com. Tired of the service provided by LiveDrive, we asked them to close our reseller account. It may be noted that at no point did we ask them to close the accounts of our customers. But they went ahead and shut down the accounts of every Backify customer.<p>For every customer's account, we have paid in advance a full year's fee. So, the step taken by LiveDrive to close our customers' accounts without refunding us is totally illegal, and we are considering our legal options at this time. Since your account was already paid fully for one year in advance, we request you to get in touch with LiveDrive and ask them to restore your service. Their customer support email address is support@livedrivesupport.com<p>Additionally, we understand that you may have spent considerable time/effort/bandwidth to upload your files to LiveDrive's servers and by deleting your files/data without any notice they may have violated several laws. We also advice you to get legal help in case you suffered losses due to this sudden termination of service by LiveDrive.<p>Thanks,\nBackify Team",1321582071

6892058,comment,6891311,6891311,134,0,grellas,,,"Why was her diary secret? Well, because she wanted it so. And that should be enough.<p>When it comes to information that any given person regards as intimate about oneself, that should always be enough. It doesn&#x27;t matter that someone else might peruse that information and say, &quot;there is nothing special here.&quot; Why? Because it is not that person&#x27;s judgment to make. There may be nothing special about my exact bank balance or net worth or state of my health or sex life or political or religious affiliations (or lack of affiliations) or any other information that I may consider private but that doesn&#x27;t mean I want that information broadcast to the world only to invite identity thieves, malicious third-parties, political enemies, or anybody else who might bear a grudge or harbor an animus to have a field day with it. But they are just &quot;facts&quot;, you might say. No, in the wrong hands, they are ammunition by which to hurt you if people want and, even if the facts themselves are innocent enough, people have a ready capacity as may suit their whims or prejudices or any other ulterior motives they may have to do you wrong and what may appear as innocent &quot;facts&quot; to one person can easily be transmuted into a vile weapon that can cost you your job, your important relationship, or any other of many things that might be the subject of someone&#x27;s jealousy or other animus toward you (a lifetime of courtroom experience has certainly shown me how easy it is for a motivated adversary to take otherwise innocent facts and twist them into malicious aspersions if they really want to). What is more, even if nobody had <i>any interest whatever</i> in harming me through misuse of that information, it is part of my essential humanity that I can separate that which I regard as intimate (to me) from that which is made freely available for public consumption. There is a reason why the word &quot;vulgar&quot; developed negative connotations over the centuries: it originally meant nothing more than &quot;belonging to the crowd.&quot; Well, crowds can trample on things you might regard as precious and it should be your choice and no one else&#x27;s whether you want to open up important parts of your life for public consumption.<p>If I happen <i>not</i> to want to keep any part of my life secret, well, that is fine too. That is a choice every person can make for himself so long as he doesn&#x27;t go about over-sanctimoniously proclaiming that others must do the same or harming others about him by revealing things that they consider intimate as he opens the book of his own life to the world.<p>It is the same in the business world. One can open-source his own works as a matter of commitment to the idea that all information ought to be free or for any other reason but that doesn&#x27;t mean the law ought to abrogate protections for proprietary, trade secret information that most businesses need to keep confidential information as a matter of competitive advantage. If I am a broker who depends for his livelihood in serving a customer base that it took years to develop, I would be rightly upset if someone came in and simply handed all my customer information over to my competitors. So too would a development team that has invested huge amounts of money and time into a development effort that gives them a significant competitive advantage over others and whose business model turns on keeping that advantage to themselves exclusively. So too would most any company management if its confidential business plans for winning key markets suddenly got broadcast publicly over the web. Examples of this type can be multiplied endlessly and really are self-evident to anyone who has had much in the way of real-world business experience.<p>Again, any private business is free to make a contrary judgment and to open itself up at every level so that it maintains no private or secret information whatever. That is their choice. But, if I want to keep things secret in my business, no one should be able to force me to do otherwise or to try to shame me into believing that I am doing something wrong.<p>Laws and public policy cannot make these choices for us as individual actors but it is essential that they set up a structure to protect those who would seek to keep their confidential information private. How and to what degree that happens in practical execution can be a complex topic in our technological age but the abiding principle, to me, is very clear: privacy is valuable in any society and laws should be shaped accordingly.<p>So, why, then, is this secret? Because the person it most affects wants it that way and the rest of us should respect that person&#x27;s wishes to keep it so.",1386809712

The costs and legal risks are too high - the regulations preclude non-millionaires from rationally accepting the same level of disclosure and disclaimers as millionaires are allowed.

Many kinds of certifications â€“ like college degrees in business/economics/law or the standard tests that already exist to qualify people as a banker/lawyer/accountant/investment-adviser â€“ should serve as adequate proof of competence.

Or, only an amount that&#x27;s less that that already saved in tax-advantaged retirement accounts (IRAs/501ks/etc).<p>Any of those standards make more sense than the &quot;are you already rich?&quot; test.",1386807756

Or more accurately, the investors will just price this into their expected return. Let&#x27;s assume the third founder wins and gets some number of shares equal to the number of shares owned by one of the other two founders. Let&#x27;s also assume, for the sake of illustration, the investors collectively hold 100 shares and each of the founders holds 100 shares. In the worst case scenario (for the investors), those newly issued shares dilute all of the current stockholders equally -- e.g. the investors would go from holding 100/300 shares to 100/400 shares.<p>Well that sucks. But if you bought into Snapchat with the expectation of a 4x return, all that means is that you&#x27;re now getting something closer to a 3x return. Not as much as you hoped -- but it still might make sense from an investment standpoint to hop on.<p>If anything, the actual litigation probably made things easier for the investors. It&#x27;s much easier to price the risk from actual ongoing litigation than potential may-or-may-not happen litigation.

The contents of the site could have been anything -- credit card numbers, blackmail information, etc., etc., and the CA legislature would still have the exact same case that they have -- extortion.<p>I suppose I glommed onto your argument because I assumed (from your other post) that you&#x27;d been following it, but I think that the implications of a &#x27;revenge porn&#x27; law didn&#x27;t actually come into play here, which sort of makes whatever point I had -- that there&#x27;s no purpose for it.<p>Whatever implications the first amendment has here, origination shouldn&#x27;t play a part in it.  If the images are obscene, that can be determined independently of how they were obtained or distributed.  If they violate someone&#x27;s personal copyright, that&#x27;s an independent claim.  If they violate local pornography statutes, that&#x27;s again, a separate crime.<p>What it seems to me is that we&#x27;ve taken a number of things that were already illegal and drafted up a new set of feel-good measures that make them illegal under a different heading.  Perhaps the net result is in sentencing, but that seems about as efficient to me as &quot;hate&quot; crime sentencing, where we&#x27;ll end up with mandatory minimums and such.<p>Anyway, sorry for pestering, you just seemed to have more knowledge on the matter than the Slate article, and I thought you&#x27;d implied that there <i>were</i> free speech implications.",1386806874

A job takes a majority of your time which would really put a damper on my dream.  There are stories of people doing both, but if it happened all the  time, it wouldn&#x27;t be a story.  I&#x27;m not using that as an excuse, I am using it to bring home the point to enjoy and take advantage of the time you currently have without responsibilities.<p>Bottom line is have fun. Experiment with different ideas.  Try to make something cool that people want.  There are more than enough resources to get started.  Just do it.",1386806511

Doing that is neither prudent nor wise, and is also an asshole thing to do. If we can agree on that, I bet everything else will be gravy.<p>Your example about insurance companies is specious. They aren&#x27;t trying to apportion blame; they&#x27;re trying to find any grounds they can on which they can avoid paying out. I&#x27;m also pretty sure that leaving your car unlocked neither excuses its being stolen, nor mitigates the insurance carrier&#x27;s obligation to make you whole, in the slightest.",1386806418

With the addition that, there&#x27;s a big difference between a friend asking to read your diary (who, we&#x27;ll note, was not in the diary, as he pointed out) and a friend (or anybody) asking to distribute your diary to the public.  I think that&#x27;s the main thing most other people are commenting on as well.  There are many levels of private and making something public is not the same as making it publicly accessible.",1386806403

149688,comment,149510,149615,0,0,gruseom,,,"I think it depends on temperament as well as on what kind of system you're trying to build. I could tell you why I love working in Lisp compared to C# - it makes building abstractions so natural and malleable that I feel like a fish swimming in water instead of glue - but it doesn't follow that your experience will be the same. All you can do is give it enough of a try to decide for youself.<p>I know lots of C# programmers who would much sooner give up abstractive power than the list of functions that pops up when they hit the ""."" key. Many are quite happy writing duplicate code as long as the IDE types half of it for them. They don't even notice the duplication. This is not the temperament that is likely to enjoy working in Lisp.<p>If, on the other hand, you feel that you increasingly have to fight with C#/ASP.NET/VS as your program grows more complex, or if you have a persistent nagging sense that it shouldn't have to be this hard, you might like Lisp.<p>Here's a suggestion. Whatever your project is, learn enough Lisp to program a basic first version of it. Resist the temptation to reject what's unfamiliar until it subsides (otherwise there's no point in the experiment). Then ask yourself which feels better.",1206827427

These weren't the biggest names in music, but they were definitely on the high end. This was long before the rise of peer to peer downloads, and even then professional music was not a viable career path. Blaming technology advancements for artists not being able to make a living off of their art is just a scape goat.<p>The concept of a ""starving artist"" predates the rise of computers and transcends all media. The only difference between the music industry and painting, sculpting, writing, or any other form of art is that a myth of past profitability has been propagated in recent years. The (unchanged) reality is that artistic expression doesn't generate revenue streams except for the very few, lucky artists.",1206827220

149670,comment,149091,149503,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"That is EXACTLY my point.  This article would have me believe that writing bad loans caused the credit crisis.<p>As a former quant, I can tell you that my belief is that the practice of improperly securing bundled debt is the cause of the credit crisis.  When everyone began to realize that their risk analysis was off, they discovered that they held bonds or other more exotic instruments that were improperly hedged.  The entire world asked for the same CDS's at the same time.  That's when EVERYONE knew the game was up.<p>BTW, if you are a quant, or if you know your finance, I would be happy to explain why I believe the collapse in the bond market is caused by the asymmetric nature of a lot of the hedging that was going on.  Or rather the total lack of hedging, and by implication, proper risk management.  CDS's, CDO's and indeed derivatives in general are going to have their problems, but that is BECAUSE of improper securitization practices.  We have a USD500 trillion, yes I said TRILLION, house of cards out there because of rampant misuse of these instruments.  The mortgage bond market is just the place where the problems cropped up first.<p>I would be happy to listen to your explanation of how bad loans were the cause, but you will have to have a good explanation for two things.  Firstly, explain why the bundles containing these loans were improperly secured in the first place, given that the lenders, according to the article you are citing, freely admit that they knew these to be bad loans?  Could it be fiduciary negligence?  Secondly, why is there so much trouble in the Jumbo market, (mortgages higher than USD417000), where CRA is not an issue at all, if CRA is the problem they are making it out to be?<p>I stand by my belief that fiscal negligence, and by implication, a failure to exercise the proper fiduciary duty to the companies, lies behind the collapse of ALL of these enterprises.  If you have evidence to the contrary, submit it.",1206825816

The Post is a liberal paper.<p>No it's not. It's owned by Rupert Murdoch (also the owner of Fox News), and it's considered a conservative paper. The Daily News is a more liberal paper. Wikipedia confirms this, though I'm sure you could look for more definitive sources if you want to surf around.<p>Frankly, I would fully expect the Post to try to scapegoat liberal activist groups.<p>> The author, Stan Liebowitz, is ""the Ashbel Smith professor of Economics in the Business School at the University of Texas at Dallas""---not exactly unqualified to speak on the subject.<p>The author is certainly qualified. On the other hand, it's apparent from reading his piece that (rightly or wrongly), he's had this axe to grind about redlining that has left him out of the mainstream consensus for quite a long time. It could be that this makes him uniquely qualified to make an assessment that no one else needs to hear, or it could mean that he's a kook that no one with any sense listens to.<p>Personally, I'm certainly not qualified to say that the article is wrong, because it may be 100% correct. However, I would like to see more evidence than the word of a guy who's been arguing a minority position for 15+ years in a newspaper that is not known for its commitment to balance.",1206825690

The New York Post may run a lot of salacious pieces, but how often does the NYPost run an <i>overtly discriminatory</i> and salacious piece?<p>Remember, this is the paper your New York workers read on the train on the way to work. That's about as mixed a bag as you can get. The New York Post, like every other New York paper, does its damnedest to appeal to the widest possible spectrum. The Post is a liberal paper. You can call it conservative, but only when you're comparing it to the NY Times. This makes the article interesting, and it should at least give you pause.<p>It's easy to take a snotty attitude against reading something like the Post, but the article, which admittedly isn't that great, raises an interesting point. In America we purposefully overlook a lot of things in the name of equality. In underwriting you don't want overlook anything.<p>The financial analysts who failed to analyze this situation are responsible for the crisis. So are the former home owners who defaulted on their loans. And the people who issued them those loans. But when good analysis is restricted by federal law, and bad analysis is incentivized, how much blame can you place on analysts before next placing it on legislation? Regardless of how much blame you assign to the legislation, you must now multiply that manyfold. This is a little thing that has made a big difference.<p>The point is that we have to ask ourselves what level of abstraction we are willing to force onto the notion of a person. Are we willing to turn so much of a blind eye that it throws us into economic recession?<p>This recession is likely to be mild, but deep recessions are a time of great uncertainty. You don't have to read very far back in history to learn that people tend to stop overlooking things when their pocketbooks are empty. Equality, in other words, is a luxury item, and like many of the things we enjoy in America, it's contingent on our economy not exploding.",1206824584

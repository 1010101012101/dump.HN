I know that the Washington Post calling something like this &quot;sophisticated&quot; is kind of ridiculous, and the reporter&#x27;s reaction is only more absurd, but there could be some real motives here.

The view that you must be <i>trading</i> that labor instead of investing it directly in creation is potentially limiting (and is, I think, what you&#x27;re actually seeing and objecting to).<p>We are presently in a situation where our particular skills (which, incidentally, society has poured some resources into developing) are capable of creating things worth owning more efficiently than it can be automated.  That is outstanding, but it&#x27;s not necessarily sustainable.<p>If labor can&#x27;t produce value, then people need to start out with something else.",1371315551

I find this puzzling. What great new ideas have emerged from Facebook, exactly? It&#x27;s just one of multiple very similar social networks that prevailed through better execution and marketing.<p>On the other hand, Amazon has built amazing cloud services - which is impressive, considering that it started as an online book shop.

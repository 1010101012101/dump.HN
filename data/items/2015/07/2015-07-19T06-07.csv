I didn&#x27;t have friends in that city and I was a work addict, which is a very bad situation to perform well and get recognition. A few things could have been done and I&#x27;m certainly disappointed he didn&#x27;t do them. I&#x27;ve left that company two years ago, came back to my home country and created my own company. He takes news often, like other colleagues, but he never admitted that he preferred me out, so I wonder what he really expected. I believe I&#x27;ve mitigated the bad situation by leaving.<p>But I was really asking about the team lead. Even for others, you drive a team by prioritizing a backlog and communicating. But if you do things your employees don&#x27;t like, it&#x27;s the same story, they still have to work hard and perform best.<p>At what moment is leadership involved in being a manager, rather than natural subordination from the employees?",1437289134

I also tend to naturally spread out my knowledge a little too thin on various projects and not really make meaningful progress on any of them.<p>Two things have helped for me - one is to have a useful project in mind for the thing you are learning, so you have a payoff at the end. The other is digging into the details of the thing to really understand the subject - and make a mental note that you&#x27;re implicitly committing to struggle and frustration in exchange for the reward of knowledge. If you aren&#x27;t willing to struggle you won&#x27;t get very far in any subject.

9910274,comment,9909535,9910009,0,0,ablation,,,">> This goes for every sport.<p>Indeed. One only has to look at the recent rash of doping convinctions in MMA (and convenient short-notice &quot;injuries&quot; before fights) following introduction of more doping scrutiny as one piece of anecdotal evidence of this. But across sport, it&#x27;s endemic.<p>Heck, the NFL practically allows doping.[1] And let&#x27;s not forget baseball.[2]<p>The only reason why certain sports receive more attention than others is due to their prior association with doping, in some weird circular logic. The Tour has Lance, baseball as Rodriguez, MMA has Anderson Silva, and so on.<p>But look at soccer. Strange that there is so little discussion about doping in soccer. And strange there have been so few convinctions for doping in soccer. Similarly rugby. They&#x27;re not sports traditionally associated with it.<p>But back to the main topic: the Tour. Yes, some performances this year have been dramatic such as Froome&#x27;s acceleration on that first proper climb. Yes the pace of the tours is still high. It&#x27;s clear the peloton is not clean, whatever that means and however it breaks down. Lance was just the king rat bully who went so far as to - like you say - &quot;ruined it&quot; for everyone else.<p>But I&#x27;m always very sceptical of armchair power analysis as evidence of doping, no matter how interesting it is. We need more stringent independent testing - IF we want the sport to be clean, which is a different matter entirely.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/sports/27iht-nfl.1.9522468.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/sports/27iht-nfl.1.9522468...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23578738"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23578738</a>",1437289091

I&#x27;m really can&#x27;t figure out why you thought otherwise. There&#x27;s nothing in my original comment about constructing artificial water-based computers.<p>>This is where Scott&#x27;s argument kicks in, where the mapping is doing all the work.<p>It is his conjecture that there is no computationally simple mapping, but I see no reason to believe that this conjecture is correct. He certainly doesn&#x27;t give any reason to think so in the paper. And to echo jameshart&#x27;s point, he gives no reason to think that the mapping from chess positions to brain states would be any simpler than the mapping from chess positions to waterfalls.<p>If you find his conjecture plausible for some reason, that&#x27;s fine, but you&#x27;re quite wrong if you think that the paper presents any rigorous mathematical argument. The discussion is much less rigorous and sophisticated than the existing philosophical literature on the topic. (After all, Putnam&#x27;s original paper contained a proof.)<p>>Further evidence of this is that even if you want to sit here and argue that this boulder that is sitting in front of us (metaphorically) really and truly is calculating the state of your mind as well, well, with another equally sensible (and exponential and impossible) mapping, it&#x27;s also calculating mine, it&#x27;s also calculating Attila the Hun&#x27;s, and it&#x27;s also calculating the brain states of the final human being to ever live, and also deer&#x27;s brains and the solutions to world hunger and pretty every other interesting thing ever, really.<p>Yes, <i>that&#x27;s the problem</i>.

Even .net remoting can transparently create objects over the network. It&#x27;s just s bad idea and better to be explicit. Like you say, the performance issues are simply a fact.<p>I&#x27;ve written some telecom stuff and ran the first VoIP oriented 911 service provider. We missed a single call in a year, and we followed up manually on that one (it was during a hard, scheduled, failover, and we were monitoring for call attempts). It&#x27;s mostly a matter of testing and just assuming everything will fail. From having higher and higher level exception handlers, to assuming every connection, server, process -- anything-- will fail and making sure there&#x27;s a failover path available. After that, there&#x27;s monitoring, to try to prevent system wide cascading failures.<p>Looking back over VoIP stuff I did more recently, the availability rate is way, way lower. A huge chunk of the problems were just lack of testing or procedure. It&#x27;s embarrassing, really. After that, lack of limits in order to prevent resource exhaustion was the second biggest problem. Failure of the runtimes/VMs was never an issue, across Windows and Linux, CLR and Mono.<p>How is Erlang going to help with logic errors more than any managed language that discourages state? I don&#x27;t see how crash and retry fixes the majority of bugs. I can see how it&#x27;s better than an unmanaged/unverified language where a single fault trashes the entire process, sure. But against JVM/CLR languages, say?<p>As far as a million lines with high uptime: the Linux kernel is pretty big and haven&#x27;t people achieved high uptime with it?

How is it going to maintain HA while pushing, say, a million packets a second of RTP traffic? Right now I just lb stuff out to various processing servers and call it a day. Even the guys I know that use Erlang, all the heavy lifting is C. Erlang&#x27;s just the signal plane (even then, I wonder how they&#x27;d scale to handling DDoS levels of signaling).<p>As far as I remember, the process distribution part, it&#x27;s just shuttling around serialized function calls over TCP, right?

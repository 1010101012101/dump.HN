The sad part is that there <i>is</i> x86-64 asm for a few variants (exp10l, exp2l, expf, expl), but since these are not C90, people tend to avoid them for more portable versions.<p>So, ironically, it can be orders of magnitude faster to compute a long-double expl() than a double-precision exp().<p>[1] Even the asm contains a lot of extra code to handle edge cases that Intel screwed up, like returning NaN for exp(+/- Inf).",1420289483

8830630,comment,8830363,8830363,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"As someone who writes portable high-performance C++ code for living I see this as no more than a great prototyping aid.<p>Adding a non-trivial system abstraction to your code - be it a file system or a socket/networking API - is always a tricky task, even for the simplest of requirements. For example, Windows API is inherently UTF16, so if you want good performance, you need to keep all your filesys references in wstirngs. But not on Windows, you&#x27;ll need strings instead. If you are to abstract this, you have a choice of either using an opaque &quot;filesystem_string&quot; type that maps to wstring/string (with an API for cross-conversion) or defining, say, an UTF8 API and then doing a boatload of run-time Unicode conversion on Windows. The fun part is that while this makes the filesystem code more compact, it has a negative effect on the rest of the application. The app will either need to deal with conversions to/from &quot;filesystem_string&quot; when serializing/displaying them or the abstraction layer will be busy converting utf8&#x27;s to the native string format. Either way you pay with performance for &quot;portability&quot;.<p>This doesn&#x27;t apply to just this new C++ TS. It&#x27;s the same issue with the existing standard POSIX API as well (fopen/fread/etc). It&#x27;s great for hacking together something that builds on Linux, BSD and Windows, but you&#x27;d typically want to put in your own system interface before shipping production version.",1420289123

8830625,comment,8830363,8830363,0,0,Nitramp,,,"From glossing over the spec, it seems as if this does not include a file system abstraction. Operations are based on `path` objects; there&#x27;s no additional state or context that&#x27;d allow e.g. implementing a virtual in memory file system without support from the operating system, or an additional user context to be used for a networked file system that needs user credentials, etc.<p>In effect this looks a lot like Java&#x27;s java.io.File (modulo some of the design warts in that), which in Java land people are trying to replace with FileSystem and Path (<a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileS...</a>).

8830624,comment,8823174,8827439,0,0,jerven,,,"Flag Day means your project is now stuck on the version of the legacy runtime of your slowest dependency to upgrade. If you have a dependency that is no longer being maintained, migrating away from it is then required.<p>This kind of flag days is why you still see some Java 1.4 around for some projects 8 years after it went into it EOL period! Projects on java 1.5 are relatively rare because they where easier to upgrade to later versions. (Java 1.5 introduced enum as a keyword, 1.4 assert) Java 1.6 and later did not introduce flag days like that for code. I think that the Java team has learned that flag days are very very painful for the wider ecosystem.<p>Something, I am personally very happy with. Because by going slower I think they have started to go faster for us end users ;) The accepted Lambda syntax and implementation was much better than the first proposals and lost nothing in expressive power. Sure it added 1.5 years before we got them, but when we got them we could actually use them right away.<p>In my experience code is kept longer than runtimes. The project I have worked on for the last 7 years was started on Java 1.4 and is moving in production to 1.8 next month. If we had to rewrite a significant part of the code each time a new version came out we would still be stuck on 1.5 today!<p>Sure Java is paying the price of decisions made 18 years ago, but that is the nature of technical debt ;) at least most of this debt was used as an investment instead of wasted.<p>PS. .Net is significantly younger than Java being a late 90&#x27;s language instead of a early 90&#x27;s one.<p>PS. These new keywords in java 1.4 and 1.5 did impact real world code, in one project we moved code from 1.4 to 1.5 and had to rename a package from something.enum to something.enums. Then we ended up with a crippling bug because some incompetent had used reflection to select a class on the basis of information stored in the Database, a class that enum in its name :( So a trivial change using refactor in JDeveloper let to a huge bill in emergency fixes roll backs and SLAs being missed.<p>Being compatible with existing code, while still evolving to the future is of real value!",1420288789

8830591,comment,8823472,8826980,0,0,Dragon029,,," - The targeting helmet has been operational for a couple of years now and has gone through 3 revisions. The 3rd revision eliminated issues of jutter, etc and is now more or less ready for combat.<p>- Onboard lightning strike protection was present, but it didn&#x27;t have an inert-gas generator (it was removed earlier for weight) which fills the fuel tanks with an inert gas as they&#x27;re drained. It&#x27;s not necessary, but it was desired - ground-based lightning tests had it go through 800+ strikes without incident, so all-weather flying is set to be permitted in the next couple of months.<p>- The jet can take hot fuel and has been able to do so for the past 8 years, with it&#x27;s primary testing bases being in Texas and Arizona. The fine-print of it&#x27;s limitations was that its radar, etc wouldn&#x27;t be operate at full power <2 minutes after take-off if it had hot fuel and had been sitting with its engine idling for 30 minutes.<p>- It&#x27;s exhaust doesn&#x27;t melt the deck, but it causes heat stresses in the long term. The Navy already has a new deck coating ready (called Thermion) which eliminates the issue and doesn&#x27;t need to be replaced anywhere near as often.<p>- The turning & acceleration performance is only poor when compared to air dominance fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon or Su-35, or legacy fighters like the F-16 when they&#x27;re stripped of external weapons, fuel tanks, pods, etc that are otherwise required for combat.<p>- It&#x27;s loiter time has never been disclosed yet, but on internal fuel only the F-35 outranges every other western fighter using internal fuel and is competitive in range against them when they&#x27;re loaded with external fuel tanks.<p>- The video uplink function is scheduled for Block 4 of the F-35&#x27;s software; the reason for its delay being that ROVER was only recently overhauled to ROVER IV and because it&#x27;s extremely unlikely the F-35&#x27;s going to be performing CAS prior to 2020 while there are still (relatively-disposable) F-16s, A-10s, etc flying.<p>- It&#x27;s original &#x27;budget&#x27; / targeted price was $50 million. While the jet&#x27;s far more expensive than that, so is every other modern fighter. Even a modern Block 60 F-16V goes for more than $70 million flyaway, while more relevant fighters like the Typhoon, Rafale, etc are over $100 million. As of LRIP 8 / F135 Lot 8, an F-35A with engine is approximately $108 million, with the total cost decreasing approximately 3.5% each year through to 2018 when full-rate production begins and the price drops to ~$85 million, being cheaper than pretty much all of the competition.<p>- The only nation that&#x27;s backed out is Canada, and even then it&#x27;s almost certain they&#x27;ll end up going with the F-35 anyway based on what the RCAF has been asking for.<p>>Yes, but the F-18 is a much, much simpler concept. Carrier-based strike aircraft. Then look at the F-35: stealthy land-based, carrier-based, and stovl aircraft that will perform strike, cas, and interceptor roles.<p>Other than the STOVL and stealth, that&#x27;s exactly what the F/A-18 is, and even then the E/F/G models have tried to utilise stealth to a degree in their forward hemispheres.",1420287249

Perhaps it also depends on how you describe a failure / success from an investor perspective.<p>I&#x27;m citing from W. Draper III&#x27;s book, the Startup Game, &quot;Tim Draper&#x27;s First Six Investment&quot;: &quot;... Tim intoned the name and and fate of each company. The first five, as I recall, were as follows: &#x27;dead, dying, bankrupt, probably won&#x27;t make it, and not so good&#x27;.&quot;\nInvestment No. 6 was &quot;Home run!&quot;.<p>A VC (or LP of a VC) would describe a venture as a success, when it brings a multiple of its initial investment 10x, respectively a better IRR the LP would get in other markets (e. g. real estate, money lending).<p>They also would take the risk to invest in companies with zero cash flow and only a chance of having revenues at some point. So that&#x27;s high risk, while comparing it with\ntargeting small companies with a positive cash flow and with none to small growth, prevented from growth by cash, network or experience of the founders, that would be a nice target for an investor who wants to see a ROI in the next five years and everything which comes on top makes his (paid) investment more valuable. It&#x27;s more like a traditional investment approach. I don&#x27;t only think there is a niche for this kind of investments I would even say that more &quot;companies&quot; / founders are fitting in that description than in the VC criteria.",1420286841

For example we also work on our own Javascript library for building the in-house CMS - <a href=""https://github.com/MailOnline/milo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/MailOnline/milo</a><p>However, Clojure (we also use Node.js BTW) really does work for us. In the 11 months since Jon&#x27;s blog post, the code has grown (I guess 30-40k LOC across several processes) but it also does much more too. I think Clojure helps because it gives more freedom to refactor/factor the code in the way the team want.<p>For example a decision could be made to create a microservice for a commonly used URL or API. Sure you can do that in other languages, but it just seems easier with functional languages, I think because the composed functions seem easier to lift and shift. I&#x27;ve no evidence for this, just gut feeling. I spent years doing Spring/Hibernate etc and really don&#x27;t miss it.<p>We&#x27;ll definitely continue to support Clojure and other functional languages.",1420286736

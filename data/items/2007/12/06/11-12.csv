86569,comment,86422,86563,0,0,marcus,,,"Don't agree with you about #2, if you really are intelligent, control the conversation and information flow.\nYou should be able to gather more information about the business from your competitors than vice versa.<p>Especially when you are still in pre-launch mode and they don't know who you are. Talk to them as a customer/supplier/affiliate, it might be a bit underhanded but Sun-Tzu would approve, you'll be amazed at how much information you can get.",1196941995

86563,comment,86422,86422,0,0,pg,,,"He got 8 out of 10 right.  2 is wrong.  You shouldn't be overly secretive, but it would be a mistake to go so far as talking with competitors; if you're smart, your competitors will benefit more from meeting you than vice versa. 10 is also mostly wrong, though the median startup might do better if they believed it.",1196939735

Which to someone used to the way big companies do things is indistinguishable from watching a child play with matches. <p>Zuckerberg didn't get where he is now by accident.",1196939454

All you can do is learn from it.<p>> All this time spent installing and twiddling with Java on a dev box and on a server is just money down the toilet as far as I'm concerned.<p>Unless you're being paid by the hour to set it up ;-)<p>> Firefox and Sun don't like each other on Ubuntu much.<p>This should be better now - if you search the ubuntu forums or one of the associated ubuntu wikis there should be an install guide somewhere, as sadiq says, it should just be a matter of installing a couple of packages.",1196939382

A recent experience for me  has been creating some plugins for blog software. It's insanely painful making them work reliably with thousands of subtly different sets of platforms/versions/themes/plugin combinations. I've learned first hand from users how much they value it, and I'm not going to give up, but wow is it ever agonizing. I almost pity my competitors for following. <p>There's tons of money to be made in creating Wasabi-like abstraction layers for all sorts of similarly hairy systems. I know I'd gladly pay for ones that would spare me.<p>",1196938917

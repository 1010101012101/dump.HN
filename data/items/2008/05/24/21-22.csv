A typical large company today has more than a /19 allocated to it; if we're really talking about exhausting the TCP endpoint space, that /19 offers 536,000,000 concurrent connections. ISP distribution layers might not do that many <i>packets</i> per second.<p>(1a) If multiplexing is the problem, we can solve that in a subtransport-layer protocol without a worldwide ISP flag day that renumbers the whole world. There are already transports that are more multiplexing-friendly than TCP --- for instance, SCTP, a well-researched telco protocol.<p>(2) IPv6 exacerbates routing problems; it doesn't solve them. Routing table explosion and address space size are orthogonal.<p>(3) If we're embracing our NAT'd future anyways, I'm not sure I care how routable IPv4 are traded, or who has to go ask Halliburton to start paying for their obscene legacy allocation. You decided to work for the ISP, not me. Have fun!",1211666349

What I mean is, all else being equal, how important is the mode of execution?<p>Another question: when is reflection really useful? (I'm asking this because I think it would be rather difficult to create a compiled language which would support reflection, although it'd be easy for an interpreted language.)<p>Thanks",1211666049

And, obviously, the Google SoC.<p>Now strike DARPA, SPAWAR, Secure Computing Corporation and McAfee Research as well --- that's TrustedBSD, a government-funded project that was required to give its code back (the ""McAfee Research"" there refers to TIS Labs).<p>Now strike Chelsio, Dell, Myricom, probably Pair Networks, and Timing Solutions, which is driver code.<p>Now strike Ethon Technologies, Ensure Technology, and Seccuris, companies nobody's ever heard of with no IP to donate to the project.<p>What do we have left? ActiveState, IronPort, Isilon, Juniper, NetApp, nCircle, Nokia, Sandvine, and Yahoo.<p>*    What did ActiveState contribute?<p>*    Did IronPort contribute back its custom filesystem and I/O scheduling code?<p>*    Did Isilon contribute back its kernel filesystem clustering code?<p>*    Did Juniper contribute back its networking code? Wait, I know the answer to that one.<p>*    Did NetApp contribute back its WAFL filesystem?<p>*    Does nCircle even have anything to contribute?<p>*    What did Nokia contribute? I know their Checkpoint appliances run FreeBSD.<p>I sound snarkier than I really mean to here, but I think the list is a bit misleading.

199075,comment,198732,198732,0,0,mindcrime,,,"Most job ads I see say ""Bachelors degree <i></i>or equivalent experience<i></i>""  In those cases, definitely apply even without a degree.  And even if they don't, apply anyway.  A lot of time stuff gets put in job descriptions by copy & paste, or because it's common, not because it's an actual requirement.  Yeah, HR might filter you out for not having a degree in some cases, but you'll get past them to the hiring manager in other cases, then you have a chance to sell yourself.",1211665175

Juniper uses FreeBSD as a control platform, but neither the core functions nor the user CLI are FreeBSD. I'm not sure why I care what IronPort uses.<p>From several years commercial reversing experience, my guess is that even if you lump NetBSD in with FreeBSD (NetBSD is the preferred BSD OS for non-X86 BSPs), you still see more Linux than BSD in embedded and appliance apps.<p>From several years shipping appliance products, I'll also suggest that while there may be apps that FreeBSD excels at (due to a better tuned filesystem and VM), for things where raw I/O and compute are the bottleneck, Linux tends to win.",1211664329

199057,comment,198732,199045,0,0,gruseom,,,"Ok, but I can't resist adding one more! First, it seems we do agree on what's ""pretentious"": not using uncommon words as such, but doing so to sound impressive with one's vocabulary. Also, I brought up Hitchens not to invoke any kind of authority but rather as rich source material for the inventive and pitch-perfect and endlessly entertaining (and, yes, unpretentious) usage of all kinds of words. It seems we agree on most of that :)<p>Lastly, I'd like to add something to this conversation that isn't merely being critical. The thing about less common words is that, often, they are <i>not</i> exactly synonymous with more common alternatives. There are often nuances that, consciously or otherwise, add to the meaning of what's being said. While thinking of this I remembered a brief post from Language Log a while back that I thought was brilliant. It takes several examples of forms that have been claimed to be interchangeable (and thus superfluous), and susses out real distinctions between them:<p><a href=""http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005487.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005487.h...</a><p>There must be a few people here who find language as interesting as I do, and would enjoy parsing out the examples they give. I'd post it as an item to HN but can't think of a title that could possibly convey the point. Oh well, maybe I'll just post it anyway...",1211663559

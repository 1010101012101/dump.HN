There&#x27;s another Planet Money story[0] about the efficacy of just giving money to people.  If you accept that reducing poverty lets people become more productive by applying more of their available effort towards actions that do more than just sustain life, I think this at least puts enough question to that assertion to make it something that needs qualification.<p><i>One possible way to help is to use technology to reduce the need for large corporations, by making more and more things doable by smaller and smaller groups of people.</i><p>How does that account for the increased efficiencies gained from being large, e.g. bulk logistics?  Walmart, split into 5,000 smaller individual stores, would likely not be able to match the prices of Walmart the mega-corporation, even if only due to bulk shipping and purchasing efficiencies (and leverage) gained by the single larger version.<p>Great discussion though, +1&#x27;s all the way up the stack for you and mrow84.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/10/25/240590433/what-happens-when-you-just-give-money-to-poor-people"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/10/25/240590433/what-hap...</a>",1396853819

7544996,comment,7544864,7544864,0,0,pilif,,,"Android needs to fix the way the permission system works. As it stands now, all permissions are asked upfront at installation time where the user has no data available to make an informed decision.<p>Also, the fact that apps only auto-update when the permissions required don&#x27;t change produces all the incentive for app developers to just ask for everything. After all, most conscious users will find something they object to at install time anyways and thus might not install and most people don&#x27;t read the dialog anyways, so not much to lose.<p>But even when android changes to ask for permissions as they are required (which could be done in a backwards compatible way by not throwing exceptions but just pretending that whatever API call you just made has succeeded, but then doing mothing or returning meaningless/no data), this still would not help with a malicious app asking nicely with a legitimate reason (&quot;let me access your SMS to read the login token&quot;) and then using that permission for illegitimate uses (&quot;let me upload all your SMS to my server&quot;).<p>Even with all these permissions, it still boils down to trust and where on the desktop world, this trust was rarely abused, in the mobile world between all the built-in adware and social integrations, that trust is badly hurt.",1396853701

I however think that the issues raised are the same generalist ones being made about business/entrepreneurship in Africa that don&#x27;t go deep enough to address the root causes of the challenges, the solutions successful people are implementing and some possible solutions that are yet to be explored.<p>Before I go any further I would like to state first that I&#x27;m speaking from the point of view of a Ghanaian entrepreneur and not an African entrepreneur because I am more familiar with the situation here at home and I would only be speculating about what transpires in other African nations.<p>Cost of equipment:<p>------------------<p>It&#x27;s true that the duty slapped on the importation of IT equipment makes you wonder what the rational is because I was under the impression that one taxed heavily the importation of luxury goods or items that are manufactured locally to protect indigenous industries. However the market is flooded with used computers/laptops from abroad that are cheap and can get the job done (albeit a bit slower that one would prefer). A core 2 duo desktop with a 15&quot; lcd monitor and a UPS will set you back Ghc700 ($260).<p>But if the cost is still prohibitive then you have to come up with an alternative solution. For example, when I got my first freelance project, I couldn&#x27;t immediately afford a pc so I leased one from an internet cafe and agreed to share the work and revenue with the owner.<p>Availability of learning material:<p>----------------------------------<p>I think IT is one of the few industries where so much leaning resources are available online for free and more so now with the advent of MOOC. If you don&#x27;t have an internet connection at home or a usb modem then go the an internet cafe.<p>PayPal blacklisting:<p>--------------------<p>Now this is a very annoying and unfortunate situation! West Africa is made up of the following countries: Benin. Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa</a>). Of all the listed countries PayPal isn&#x27;t in 4, namely: Ghana, Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Liberia (<a href=""https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide</a>). One of the reasons PayPal doesn&#x27;t want to do business with us is because of credit card fraud which I think is a rather lazy excuse. If Skrill can make it work then really...<p>However iTunes, Skrill, iStockPhoto, Hetzner.de, Linode, AWS, Rackspace, Register.com, Gandi among others all accept visa cards from Ghana so you can get by without PayPal (although you can&#x27;t register your copy of Sublime Text so you have to I&#x27;ve with the annoying reminders or switch to Komodo IDE).<p>Banks here don&#x27;t issue Visa Credit cards willy nilly but you can more easily apply for an international Visa Debit card and if your bank doesn&#x27;t offer one then change to another institution!<p>I&#x27;m going to end this comment here because it&#x27;s getting too long and I&#x27;m running on a UPS (lol) but my main point is that yes, there are challenges but they are surmountable. You either solve them head on or work around them but there is always a solution. And besides entrepreneurship is all about the fun of solving challenges anyway so come over to Ghana and have some REAL Fun!",1396852397

In Rust, the runtime representation of enums (tagged unions) is left deliberately unspecified in order to allow for arbitrary optimizations depending on shape.<p>For example, The Option type in Rust (a.k.a. the Maybe type in Haskell) is a tagged union defined like this: [1]<p><pre><code>  enum Option<T> {\n      None,\n      Some(T)\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNow say I use this like so:<p><pre><code>  let foo = Some(6);\n</code></pre>\nThe runtime represenation of `foo` will be as follows:<p><pre><code>  struct FooRepresentation {\n      discriminator: u8,\n      value: int\n  }\n</code></pre>\n...where `discriminator` is the field that determines whether the value is `None` or `Some`, and in the latter case `value` will contain the associated data.<p>But let&#x27;s say I declare foo a bit differently, using a pointer to a value rather than a raw value:<p><pre><code>  let foo = Some(~6);  // the tilde denotes a unique pointer\n</code></pre>\nNow the runtime representation of `foo` is only a single pointer, and in order to determine if `foo` is `None` it just checks to see if the pointer is null. Rust is smart enough to perform this optimization on any tagged union with two variants where only one of the variants has associated data, and the type of that variant is a pointer.<p>On the flipside, if you want to guarantee a specific data layout then you can use a struct, which have the same layout rules as structs in C.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/option.rs#L150"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/optio...</a>",1396851625

Then in the spring, they launched a weather satellite, the week after I submitted my first assembly language program, which came back with my first bug (I think I had a period instead of a comma), and there wasn&#x27;t any more machine time for high schoolers... \n  Columbia also had a Bendix G-15 which had a head-per-track   rotating drum for main memory: instructions were mostly 3-address: two operand addressses, and a next-instruction address, all from the current track. Much fun to try to lay out the instructions and data optimally.",1396850544

It seems so obvious that there&#x27;s an entire platform to open up here based on this kind of thing, but neither one seems to be interested in doing it. Instead they are privately noodling away, just incrementally building up their own vocabularies which are really pitifully small in the wider context of things. They must both know there would instantly be an explosion in 3rd party support the minute they add useful APIs, and it would be a major selling point for either OS ... I wonder why they are both so reluctant to do it?",1396850417

We have only so much time available to learn new things (as opposed to writing production code), and so you want what you learn to pay off as much as possible long term.<p>You wouldn't argue ""Why don't you just learn every language out there?"", right?<p>The prob is that being a ""pro"" takes a really long time. For example to be a \n""C#"" you need to really dive into the CLR and its internals, be familiar with all of the new features that's been added to .NET in the past years, get familiar with all of the tools out there (VS is basically a topic on its own) and then likely some related technologies like WPF / WCF depending on what you're writing. That's a LOT of learning and practicing for one language, and you probably don't want to throw all of that away long term.",1317070768

I can think of just one suggestion outside of what others have suggested:<p>I'd love it if I could get it as an image instead of CSS.  Since I would only use it for a display and probably not any dynamic text, just a transparent png export of the image would be sweet.  Even a non-transparent image export would be useful (and necessary with any amount of blur on the drop shadow).<p>On my own I can print screen and pull in the text into an image, resize it, and make it transparent but others might not have the resources or know how to do that.",1317070665

We do a lot of heavy algorithms and distributed systems, so we ask that, but it also happens to be what students learn.<p>Running time and Oh, however, in addition to systems knowledge, is extremely important to creating good software in general. If you can't determine how your software will scale with big data, and you can't understand why efficient code that runs quickly with small operations does so, you simply can't write good software.<p>I realize a lot of people on HN take offense at these claims because they've written programs without this knowledge and claim they are self taught.

That said, the first two chapters cover some math which is probably good to know.<p>The book is primarily about algorithms. It touches on data structures where needed to implement or describe an algorithm, but not much more besides (at least in the parts I've gotten through so far). I have not read any good data structures book, but have found Wikipedia to be a very good resource. I suggest avoiding overly language-specific books on the matter--I think that Java books in particular are insidious, but I am little biased in that regard.<p>The best approach would probably be to read through a section about some algorithm, look at what sorts of problems it can solve and then write a simple program to solve those problems.

3040521,comment,3039873,3040440,2,0,rcfox,,,"> the part I'm really curious about is ""From there, you can pretty much combine these rules to analyze many algorithms.""<p>I'm not sure if I'm still misunderstanding you, but here's an example of what I meant.<p>Say, for whatever reason, you want to populate a binary tree with k items of random data:<p><pre><code>    for(int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {\n        int data = rand(); // Let's assume this is O(1)\n        tree.insert(data); // O(log(n))\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe inside of the loop runs in O(log(n)) time because O(log(n)) > O(1). We're doing it k times, so the total time is O(k<i>log(n))<p>Now, if you wanted to do this for m trees:<p><pre><code>    for(int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {\n        for(int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {\n            int data = rand();\n            tree[j].insert(data);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWe already know that the inner loop runs in O(k</i>log(n)). Since we've just added a loop around that, it's easy to see that the whole thing runs in O(m<i>k</i>log(n)) time.",1317067549
3040520,comment,3039873,3040384,4,0,dennyferra,,,"I've been doing this exact same thing to learn. I read an interview question that asked how to sort a linked list. I tried implementing it on my own. Later I looked online to see other implementations and compared with my version. I was a little bummed to see my solution wasn't ideal but it only made me dig deeper.<p>Later on I found some Stanford lectures, particularly Programming Abstractions by Julie Zelenski (around lecture 14). After watching that lecture I was able to classify my linked list sorting attempt as a selection sort. I was pretty excited that I wrote a selection sort without even knowing what kind of sorting I was doing. I have yet to use my newly acquired knowledge at work but I'm now confident I can spot certain sorting algorithms and I'm much more aware of when to use each.<p>If anyone is aware of any other resources like books, online tutorials or videos I would love to hear about them!",1317067525
3040519,comment,3039873,3040286,75,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"The good thing is that most operations on most data-structures (as well as many of the more common algorithms) don't require solving recurrence equations to determine their asymptotic growth, usually our intuition based on counting tends to be pretty close.<p>Sketch out your basic data structures on a piece of paper, then just use your finger to trace out how you could do insert, delete, search, etc  you can usually tell if something is taking O(lg n), O(n), O(n lg n), etc just by counting the steps you take. After you're comfortable with this, sketch it in your head.  You can't forget something that you understand.<p>The point is that if figuring what out Big O is seems like something you have to memorize to recall quickly, then you very likely don't really understand the underlying data structure/algorithm (and as such you rightfully should do poorly on algorithms interviews). Take the time to make sure you really understand what's going on, and everything else should fall into place.",1317067521

For example, if for some reason control-A doesn't work from the keyboard, it's always possible to ""click"" a button that will produce a control-A.

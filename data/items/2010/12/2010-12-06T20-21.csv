But even so, they rolled their native client anyway, because the web client doesn't feel and behave like a native iPhone app.<p>A native iPhone app is property optimized for the screen width, it does local caching (which a web app used on a desktop doesn't need to do), it behaves differently in regards to the control used (which respond to different events), and in many cases it is desirable to get rid of the page metaphor, no request/response cycle, etc...<p>The business logic may be the same, but the UI logic is very different and you don't want something autogenerated because the UI itself is usually a competitive advantage; and assembling it is not the hard part, a lot harder is to come up with a good design or to make your backend stable (I don't know how it happens but when I go to Foursquare 6 times out of 10 their service is down).<p>For instance ... I'm using Twitter a whole lot more on my iPhone because the native client kicks ass. In contrast I use Facebook more on my desktop because the Twitter's web interface sucks (yeah, I'm weird like that).<p>What I'm trying to say is ... companies that want cheap transition to new platforms like the mobile, already have the right tools: the web and its related protocols; which are more ubiquitous than ever. If you want more than that (say, to differentiate yourself from the competition, or just to keep up), autogenerating the UI won't help; you'll have to get down and dirty because the beauty of a good design lies in the details.<p>There's no free launch or silver bullet.",1291668979

Every social network has their own point of view on what consists of your identity. This serves only the providers end goal of providing you a specific value.<p>As a (hopefully) more intuitive approach, my solution helps users organize their identity data into a unified (and standard) model around which they can define ""roles"". To the user, this feels like any other typical social network URL aggregation service (bookmarks?) which users seem to be adopting quite well. The added value from my solution is that they can use this new foundation to promote specific aspects of themselves within a targeted context both online and offline. Additionally, users will be able to receive metrics and feedback on individual relationships to improve future interaction with your audience.<p>My overall objective is to improve personal branding and advertising and see this as a growing niche.

1976734,comment,1976130,1976130,0,0,lmkg,,,"This post makes some sense in the context of Common Lisp as well, because it also has the bottom value NIL, of type NULL, which is always a subtype of all types (type T is also a supertype of all types, making the type system a complete lattice). Lisp's type system isn't as rigid, or as flexible, but the construction of lists follows a similar pattern, and the AND and OR type constructors make the relation between types and partial orders pretty explicit.<p>But, the one thing that sticks out to me is that NIL is a full-fledged value in Lisp, and I've never seen an equivalent bottom type in any Haskell tutorial. In fact, it would seem to violate the strictness of the type system (given that I don't fully understand said type system). Does Haskell have a ""real"" (reifiable?) bottom type, i.e. can your functions actually return bottom in a valid program, or is the bottom value only something that appears when you're doing theoretical analysis of the type system?

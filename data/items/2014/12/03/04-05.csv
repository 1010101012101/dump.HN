It is not too difficult to tell retrospectively.  (Any research that tries to measure competence/success indicators must be using something as its dependent variable, right?)  The line you quote is specifically about the fact that resumes could be meaningful even if her competence assignments were not.  Resumes seem to fail at that test as well.<p>The biggest threat to validity would probably be that different people will be good/bad developers in different environments, and that this effect is very strong.  Then each reviewer could be good at selecting for success in their own company, but they would only agree with each or with aline to the extent that their environment was similar to that of other companies or the ones that aline placed those engineers at.

It is preferable to the &quot;OO is Java&quot; definition that is often pushed.<p>> Sorry, but I disagree. It is. In this very HN thread we&#x27;re replying to, for example.<p>I was presenting what I thought was what really is seen as the benefits of OOP.<p>> Now you are trying too hard. No, it&#x27;s unnatural to speak of &quot;passing messages to objects&quot;. This isn&#x27;t how people understand the real world (except for old ladies who speak to their plants, but they are not the target audience of Smalltalk or Objective-C), and in fact message passing is one of the most alien (and harder to understand) aspects of the OOP abstraction. So alien, in fact, that some OO languages do away with this terminology.<p>Anthropomorphisms are as old as Aesop; heck before we had much formal science, it was are only way of understanding things (reading Plato and Aristotle). Message passing is just communicating with something, you might not ever think &quot;we have to tell that object to update itself&quot; but plenty of people do. Note I&#x27;m not really a big fan of message passing, and it is hardly something exclusive to OO (my colleagues are very much into RPC without an object in sight).",1417582074

Monitor speakers are used nearly exclusively in professional studios as what you are mixing for. Headphones have multiple places in the production process where they are used, but they&#x27;re not the final target.<p>There&#x27;s a few reasons for this. The most pragmatic is that doing so will produce the track that sounds the best on the widest variety of setups - EQed or not. There&#x27;s also not any single headphone out there that is used so predominately that it would make sense to cater to it in specific. The closest might be apple earbuds, but people using those probably aren&#x27;t too concerned about sound quality anyway, so it doesn&#x27;t make sense to mix with those in mind either.<p>From a theoretical standpoint, you&#x27;re not necessarily wrong, but it&#x27;s just not how things currently work, and there&#x27;s not really any reason why it ever would work that way in a professional studio.<p>I make no claim as to what the people making music exclusively in their bedroom are doing, though.",1417581882

8691947,comment,8690157,8691182,0,0,TheLoneWolfling,,,"Hence the reason why I call it a pet theory. That being said, there are potential mechanisms. Take, for example, shot noise at low light levels. The sensitivity of the human eye is ~5-9 photons within a 100ms period - well, actually, down to a single photon, before filtering[1], but 5-9 before a signal is sent. That is well within the realm of shot noise being significant. Or, for another mechanism, we know that triggering individual neurons can have specific macro-scale effects[2]. Although I haven&#x27;t found anything on the minimal random fluctuations to trigger a neuron (15mV? But I do not know the capacitance, and as such that value is meaningless to me), and I suspect it is far above the scale at which quantum effects are significant, we do suspect[3] that neurons employ temporal encoding, and we know that neurons fire relatively often (often 10-100 Hz). As such, &quot;edge&quot; effects, where a neuron is or isn&#x27;t pushed over the edge into firing are a potential mechanism.<p>But as for the rest of it - &quot;in the materialist view, you cannot have any free will or any kind of ability to make a non-determined choice&quot;. This is what I disagree with. Non-determinism arises through (for example) shot noise, and as for free will... The effects of randomness on a system and the effects of &quot;free will&quot; on a system are equivalent. There is no way to tell if a particular decision was randomly decided or if it was the result of a decision by a sentience. Entropy of a signal is at its maximum either when something is random noise or if it is perfectly compressed data - and perfectly compressed data is indistinguishable from noise.<p>[1] <a href=""http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Quantum/see_a_photon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Quantum/see_a_photon.h...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/123485-mit-discovers-the-location-of-memories-individual-neurons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/123485-mit-discovers-the-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_coding#Temporal_coding"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_coding#Temporal_coding</a>",1417581801

8691914,comment,8691654,8691654,0,0,bertomartin,,,"Recently investigating this myself. Mongoid is an Rails ODM for MongoDB. It seems like a nice one to start with as the interface is very close to ActiveRecord. I haven&#x27;t looked at the rest you mentioned, but I&#x27;ve used the relational aspects of postgres; it&#x27;s a great db, but if you&#x27;re thinking about going NoSQL, why not go the whole way? Many serious companies are using these technologies for their businesses, and they seem to have matured over the past few years. A good place to get more information on MongoDB is: <a href=""https://university.mongodb.com/courses/catalog"" rel=""nofollow"">https://university.mongodb.com/courses/catalog</a>. BTW, one thing to be careful of when working with nosql is that you still need to model your data and you can definitely model relationships (just that they usually don&#x27;t support joins at the db level). So, you could go through pretty much the same steps that you would when modeling data for a SQL db, but in the nosql case, it&#x27;s easier to change the schema as you go. So you can imagine an Author entity, with a bunch of Book entities embedded in a single document (MongoDB or other document oriented stores). If later, you wanna add Book to another document, then you can separate Book into it&#x27;s own document and add a relation. The difference with SQL is that you don&#x27;t do joins in the db, but with Mongoid, you don&#x27;t even see this as the relationships are defined in the models, and they&#x27;re pretty much the same as ActiveRecord.

They even take applications from outside the district. There is no &quot;qualifying&quot; for entry. However, as with any school facility, space is not infinite. One of the things that lets charter schools stand out is that they usually have smaller class sizes than the non-charter schools. They are not going to just cram more kids in. So if 1500 students apply for a school that only has room for 1200, then a randomized lottery is performed. I don&#x27;t know how other charter schools do it but ours has the most opening for kindergarten (obviously), very few spots for 1st-4th (only available spots are to replace students that leave the school), a few more in 5th grade (a class size increase allows for more new students) and then back to very few spots for 6th-8th. But the charter does have other provisions that allow for the lottery to be not <i>truly</i> random. It is weighted a little.

8691852,comment,8687804,8687804,0,0,keerthiko,,,"I think chanting &quot;talent shortage&quot; as many Silicon Valley tech companies do is hurting the immigration reform cause rather than helping. Also lobbying to increase the size of the pool makes no sense - it&#x27;s just going to get fill the insatiable desire of body shops like Wipro, Infosys, TCS etc that are the main cause for tech salary undercuts -- by mass importing workers who jump ship asap willing to take low pay.<p>One of the things we really need is for a skilled graduate or immigrant to be allowed freedom of employment. This stops driving salaries down, because employees then aren&#x27;t bound to an employer to get their green card or maintain their legal status (giving the employer freedom to put the salary where they want because of desperation). Yes, the H1B portability exists in theory, but in practice they&#x27;re unusable - with only 60 days of legal unemployed time between jobs, having to secure a new offer before initiating the transfer process, and having any active green card application processes (which can take more than 5 years usually) killed if you transfer, we might as well pretend the portability option doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>I would also like to note this reformed H1B shouldn&#x27;t be awarded to the body-shop-type employers (basically anyone employing over 40% immigrants <i>and</i> over 100 people). Technically this clause exists today, but these body shop companies have a lot of phantom &quot;US Citizen&quot; employees to bloat their total employee numbers and then all the actual staff is imported. Those practices need to be audited more closely at least for the larger companies and curbed.<p>At the very least, I think it makes sense for someone who has spent 4 or more years in US in the capacity of a student to be given freedom of employability a little more easily, without restricting them to having to go to one of very few employees that can secure them a H1B visa now and commit the first 5-10 years of their career at that one place (or leave the country) to stop being treated worse than illegal immigrants.<p>More importantly, I think the process needs to recognize the fact that there is no room for company founders, other than the atrocious O1 process which is expensive and time consuming and subjective. I personally believe anyone who can demonstrate basic intent to create a job and shows qualifications for it (maybe after operation of the company for some period of time) should be given a visa with weird restrictions on salary and job title and whatnot, with an audit clause for every 2 years or something. All the existing visa programs are extremely constrained for most founder circumstances (which are quite varied, because founders are supposed to be about finding creative ad hoc solutions).<p>Disclaimer: Cofounder of a silicon valley startup gone digital nomad because of 2 failed H1B attempts and not being able to justify 2-4 months company-wide paychecks to apply for an O1+lawyer.",1417579402

It&#x27;s entirely possible to survive without working.<p>It&#x27;s also entirely possible to choose to go to college for several years rather than work - the decision to go to work at that point can be as as much an active (and optional) choice as going to college. No one is forcing you to do one or the other, or neither, at that point.<p>And even if you do have to work, you can choose to do the bare minimum to get by, or you can make the personal choice to push yourself.",1403679469

But here&#x27;s the buried TL;DR:<p>* It&#x27;s going to superficially resemble 2014.<p>* However, every object in the real world is going to be providing a constant stream of metadata about its environment — and I mean every object.<p>* The frameworks used for channeling this firehose of environment data are going to be insecure and ramshackle, with foundations built on decades-old design errors.<p>* The commercial internet funding model of 1994 — advertising — is still influential, and its blind-spots underpin the attitude of the internet of things to our privacy and security.<p>* How physical products are manufactured and distributed may be quite different from 2014. In particular, expect more 3D printing at end-points and less long-range shipment of centrally manufactured products. But in many cases, how we use the products may be the same.<p>* The continuing trend towards fewer people being employed in manufacturing, and greater automation of service jobs, will continue.",1403679392

You need to time it right to get enough upvotes, you need to target your audience, you need to be ready to handle the traffic, and your product needs to be in a state that&#x27;s ready for criticism.<p>This is an encouraging story, but to others out there: be careful!

I remember, I hadn&#x27;t taken a single leave in 5 years. I knew many of my senior colleagues hadn&#x27;t taken one in 7+ years. When the mandatory leave encashment period arrived, we ended up with a quite a good chunk of cash.<p>After that the leave encashment policy was amended by the then CFO, realizing what had just happened. The new policy was designed to have a concept of &#x27;leave expiry&#x27;(If you don&#x27;t rest, may be you don&#x27;t deserve rest in the future).<p>I guess the new CFO&#x27;s now realize, &#x27;leave expiry&#x27; policies force the other kind of culture- where every one wants to take leaves which now forces the people who other wise don&#x27;t take leave to take it, because no one wants to &#x27;waste&#x27; leaves.<p>So the most obvious solution is to put in a &#x27;unlimited vacation&#x27;. So that the onus of leave is on you and your manager, if you there is ever a free time in your project you can have that vacation(Which will never come to pass anyway). This way you neither have to pay leave encashment nor have employees who enjoy full benefit of leaves. Instead the company as a whole now has lesser employees taking fewer leaves.",1403679360

They required a $90 per month ARPU - when you factor in business use (many who would be paying in the region of $400 - $2000 because of higher traffic classes, lower contended CVC, business SLAs, etc), home users would only need to average about $60-70 a month (that&#x27;s more than I pay for ADSL that doesn&#x27;t hit 4Mb/s), and that&#x27;s an average which is skewed by the power users (as per the Pareto principle).<p>So the average household would only be paying $30 to $60 a month, which is more than competitive with ADSL when you factor in Telstra line rental.

It is often triggered by changes in hardware availability.<p>Scripts that were developed in the age of stone tablets will change when the tablet and chisel are replaced with paper and brush, and again when the brush is replaced with a fountain pen, and again when the whole setup is replaced with a computer. People will naturally adopt the style that allows them to convey meaning the most conveniently in a given medium.<p>Chinese, Japanese, and Korean were all written vertically from right to left (|||) until only a few decades ago. Now they are very often written horizontally from left to right (≡). A lot of factors have contributed to the change, such as the ease of embedding Western, mathematical and scientific symbols in a CJK sentence, the need to keep one&#x27;s hands clean when writing with a modern pen, and of course the introduction of computerized typesetting.<p>Nobody forced anyone to write horizontally. People just gravitated towards what they found more convenient given the availability of new writing tools. And of course, many artists and calligraphers continue to write vertically when it suits their intentions better. Even better, new calligraphical techniques have been developed to take advantage of unique opportunities that horizontal writing offers.

Unfortunately the Abbasid empire came to an end in 1258 AD and Urdu wasn&#x27;t even around then.<p>I take your point that naskh has been wide-spread. And it is true that it is even in the Indian sub-continent. Sindhi, for example, is a naskh based language. Punjabi, which my parents spoke, on the other hand, prefers nastaliq, and regionally the two places are adjacet. That doesn&#x27;t mean that those people didn&#x27;t historically play around with scripts. They did.<p>However, my piece is entirely about what is going on today. Sure you can find Ottoman era signs in Egypt and the Levant that display Arabic in nastasliq (my readers sent me plenty such pictures), but by and large Arabic today is written in naskh and almost never in nastaliq. Take a look at some of the fonts that the Omani government is playing around with. They are not nastaliq. This is the political aspect I briefly touched upon in the article. I hope you will get a chance to look into the Arabization aspects of the political debates raging in that part of the world. I make brief mention of it by bringing up the fight over &quot;Khuda Hafiz&quot; or &quot;Allah Hafiz.&quot;<p>Meanwhile, the past two or three generations of Urdu readers and writers grew up associating nastaliq and Urdu almost exclusively with each other (thus the jarring effect associated with having to read Urdu in something else). I have plenty of emails testifying to this from people from my parents generation and some people of mine.<p>In short, no one is really talking about ancient Arab history here, as fascinating as that would be.",1403678293

I just want to say I understand your sentiment, but your title and content are filled with some annoying misinformation and discrepancies.<p>First of all, Nastaliq is not &quot;the Urdu script&quot;.  If you even skimmed Wikipedia, you would notice that the script does come oringinally from Arabic (where it is used, but more to your point, sadly not as much in print media, at least from my experience in the GCC) and was later well loved by the Persians, and later different portions of the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan, and beyond).  To call it Urdu script, just because it is popular, and to insinuate that it Naksh is the default script of Arabic (it is not the preferred one, by the way) is a huge stretch.<p>Another point: Naksh was invented by a Persian, but who grew up his whole life in Arab Baghdad and was an Abbasid court vizier in modern-day Iraq.  He did not spend time in Iran (then Fars, as it is known today in Arabic), until he was a tax collector there after growing up in Iraq, and only for a period.  He might have been ethnically Persian, but to call Naksh script Persian because of the guys family background is far-fetched, especially if you know how loose the cultural boundaries between Abbasid Iran-Iraq were (they were part of the empire and people, goods, and ideas freely flowed between them).  It is a derivative of Kufic script, and has strong ties to the religious intellectual history of Iraq (Basra and Kufa were the seat of a massive amount of religious scholarship and still prominent beliefs in Islam; scripts and art were an awesome by-product).<p>Sorry for the rant, but I know this is probably not your field.  As I guy who spent a lot of time studying Arabic and Arab and/or Islamichistory, I get very annoyed at the misinformation peddled by people about Arabic history and culture.

(I&#x27;m assuming your transit authorities are under municipal jurisdiction, like the ones in Canada and the US.)<p>It took us the better part of the last decade, but virtually every transit operator in the Toronto, Ontario, Canada area is now on Google Maps. Not necessarily with real-time GPS, although the transit authorities in more well-to-do municipalities tend to have it.<p>But you have to work with your neighbours to make it a priority. Whenever they ask for comments (hopefully your municipality is modern enough to ask for this through online forms) then fill it out and ask for them to provide Google Maps data.<p>(On the other hand, local lawsuits also had a part in it -- a disabled (blind or deaf, I forget which) person sued a local transit authority saying that not having the stops announced was preventing him from using public transit and won. So every transit authority had to have drivers read out every stop until they could install computers with GPS and LCD displays and text-to-speech to read out all the stops. Once the buses and trains all had GPS and computers on-board, adding real-time tracking was just a matter of installing a GSM modem on each vehicle.)",1403676764

I could write a long, blunt tirade about this.<p>Basically the cards are stacked against these businesses from the day they are funded.<p>Male tech folks make a lot of false assumptions about female focused businesses. For investors it can mean leaving a complicated business model under-funded. For developers it means blindly taking a “cofounder” title in exchange for an equity-heavy compensation deal without thinking through what it means to work on a business you aren’t passionate about, for years, at reduced pay.<p>In both cases, if there isn&#x27;t an early slam-dunk hockey stick marker of success, guys don’t have the stamina to tolerate a female-focused business for very long. They bail. The company never gets its next round of funding. The engineering talent runs for the hills. Its not cool to work on a company for girls, especially a struggling company for girls. So male talent will just split as soon as the going gets rough.<p>Each time the company has a setback, the guys all start to bail. So the company needs to find new talent and appease many people at every little bump in the road. This is hugely costly and results in a lot of unnecessary crisis moments, doubts, and subsequent pivots.<p>The sad part is that a lot of female founders leave startups for good after one failure. I have a linkedin network filled with former female founder superstars who work in humdrum non-tech management roles. Women take the loss on a much more personal level than men do. So every time a female founder is stunted, and then abandoned by her male support network, she may be gone for good.<p>What’s the solution? I’m not sure, but I think it has a lot to do with adding more female investors and developers to the world. That and encouraging more former female founders to come back, mentor and try again",1403676758
7942508,comment,7938606,7938606,1,0,SuperDuperTango,,,"My two suggestions are: learn everything you can about being a good manager and leader where you are now.  Use the time you have as a &quot;new (manager|lead)&quot; in a company that knows you&#x27;re a &quot;new (manager|lead)&quot; to be the eager newbie (just like you probably did when you were a newbie dev).  Find the managers and leaders who you think are good and who have traits that you aspire to have and learn them while you can. Being a good technical manager and leader takes some of the skills of being a good dev, but a whole other set of skills that you generally don&#x27;t need when being a dev.  Finding a good mentor (even if they don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re mentoring you) is something you can more easily do at your current company.<p>When you do look for another job, be up front with the company you&#x27;re talking to.  You may want to interview for a Senior dev position, but tell the recruiter that you want to parlay your experience into being a manager or lead. At my last company, we hired a couple of folks like this, and they almost all turned out to be good managers and leaders.",1403676728

Essentially, many people from families in the higher classes go to school to learn programming because of the prospective earning potential and pressure from their families to succeed.<p>Many of the anecdotes mentioned projects that failed because the developers working offshore had a tendency to build the projects strictly to the specification. Despite the fact that the specification was incomplete or contained assumptions that were later discovered to be false. Ie they built what they were told to build, not what matched the &#x27;real&#x27; requirements of the project.<p>The &#x27;average&#x27; programmer there has little personal interest in the field and culturally they&#x27;re more inclined to respect authority &#x27;do as their told&#x27; not &#x27;do what they think is right&#x27;.<p>A true measure of potential in a programmer can be seen in the willingness/ability to think and approach problems with a high degree of divergent thinking. To look beyond the rules/limitations of a system and discover novel solutions to their problems.<p>Accounting OTOH requires a very high degree of convergent thinking. Meaning, it&#x27;s not only expected but absolutely vital for accountants to work within the bounds of the established laws/policies. There&#x27;s a very fine line between creative accounting to increase the margins and cooking the books.<p>In cultures that put a lot of emphasis on respecting authority and doing what&#x27;s expected, accounting may be a better fit culturally. Especially, compared to cultures that put less emphasis on authority and order.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that there aren&#x27;t talented/passionate programmers in those countries.

7942495,comment,7925162,7928993,1,0,chacham15,,,"I am coming from an information theoretic standpoint. Let me start over: imagine the number writer chooses ANY two numbers completely at random. Knowing what one number is gives NO information about the second number since they were both chosen completely randomly. Therefore, the chance that the second number is larger is equivalent to the number of larger numbers divided by the total (i.e. 50% because a constant number is infinitesimally small compared to the infinity that lies on both sides). Therefore, to suggest that the probability can be swayed one way or another has to violate an assumption that I made in this argument. The assumption that the article makes which violates my argument is the assumption that larger numbers are less likely to be chosen by the number writer than small numbers. It is that crucial piece of knowledge that allows the probability to sway from 50%. That is the whole purpose of the coin flip or the gaussian equation: to reflect that piece of knowledge in your guesses. To take the idea to the extreme, if I know that there are only two numbers then I can win 100% of the time.<p>In conclusion, the point is that this method doesnt work in all, or even most cases; only in cases in which you KNOW that larger numbers are less likely to be chosen than small numbers. Furthermore, how much better than 50% you can do depends completely on how well your approximation function (the gaussian function or flipping coins) accurately reflects the smaller probability of larger numbers. Now if you want to deal with people, the number of ways in which people generate random numbers is so large that I am hard pressed to believe that you can find an accurate enough approximation function that will work across the population. For example, try playing this game with your 12 year old nephew who just learned about million, billion, and googleplex and you are likely to do no better than 50%.",1403676446

One would be the legibility. Of course I cannot judge legibility of writing systems I do not like, but it seems that nastaliq would be hardly readable on a lot of mobile devices and I wonder how difficult learning the ornate script is. I am talking about alphabetization here.<p>Next thing is: I am learning turkish and turkish is written in the roman alphabet. As far as I know, it was written in a arabic/persian script before which was then reformed to use the latin alphabet. As far as I can tell this is today really uncontroversial and using the latin alphabet is actually the more suitable alphabet for turkish and its rich vowel system that is really important for grammar and meaning. Again I cannot really say anything for Urdu, but knowing it is not arabic but afaik a language of the indo-european family I wonder if there are more reasons to use the lating alphabet than just availability of nataliq fonts and rendering engines.<p>As a side note I would add a few observations relating to the cultural/heritage aspects. In Germany, the &quot;Fraktur&quot; was used widely even at the beginning of the 20th century (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktur"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktur</a> ). Some authors, like Hermann Hesse refused that Antiqua fonts would be used for their writings until publishers convinced them that their works could just not be read by young folks. In a way, a lot of people argued against using non-gothic fonts, but in the end antiqua became quite standard. Nowadays we use the lating alphabet (and most people are not concious about that there ever was a switch).",1403676224

It also required packages to be signed, which would&#x27;ve provided some of what is necessary in a model like Nix&#x27;s, and in CoApp, each <i>package</i> is maintained in git, in a separate repository from the original projects. It looks like CoApp is still being worked on, although there&#x27;s little activity - Nuget basically pushed this project to be stillborn, because Nuget provided an immediately convenient solution to the woes of Windows developers, without actually solving package management - the rest of Microsoft jumped on it and CoApp was ignored.<p>Perhaps the downside of CoApp is the requirement to support Visual Studio, and to not acknowledge the existence of mingw/msys, which are really a requirement for building many projects, and the effort to port these builds into VS is non-trivial. I agree that cygwin is not a solution, it shouldn&#x27;t be considered as such as it&#x27;s more like the windows equivalent of WINE. Mingw/msys suffers from nearly all the same woes as the rest of windows, although it now has it&#x27;s own &quot;PM&quot; (mingw-get), which is an improvement over the way things were done before then, mingw-get isn&#x27;t a very sophisticated PM, more like a specialized downloader.<p>This goes against what i just said above, but I think any potential solution on Windows needs to be liberated from Microsoft (and MS specific toolchains) - that is, a solution built around mingw and msys, whereby the mingw base packages become the bootstrap packages for an immutable model, and where those packages can reference Windows components with some alternative means to give them identities other than hashing of binaries - for example, the PM could provide some way to override the requirement of hashes for dependencies, granting that special permission only to mingw packages. The rest of user-land software would be built with mingw.<p>Of course there is conflict here on building with VS versus mingw - the binaries produced by each aren&#x27;t really compatible at all, so the use of both would require a dual build system. There&#x27;s something out there like this - the KDEwin project, which has packages for both toolchains - however, there is still significant work needed to improve the state of KDE on windows, and the PM itself.<p>Nobody is really suggesting that we don&#x27;t use Babel, or that Nix is going to replace it overnight - you&#x27;re absolutely right that getting something like Nix on Windows will take monumental effort, but we&#x27;re sharing ideas for more long-term solutions to packaging problems, which continue to get more complex, and tools like Babel don&#x27;t actually do much to solve that growing complexity.",1403676018

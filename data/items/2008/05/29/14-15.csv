(It's a small group for many diseases but they are out there.)<p>What I am saying is the real cost of treating a broken leg is less than what people with or without insurance pay in the US.  When you seek treatment the hospital / doctors office does a quick ""what are my chances of being paid back"" and then they charge you Total Cost of Treatment * Profit / (pay back%).  So someone with insurance might pay 500$ * 1.2 / .8 = 750$. But someone without insurance might pay 500$ * 1.2 / .5 = 1200$.<p>Now if relative to the rest of the world our system was cheaper or more effective then I would say stick with it but it's not.

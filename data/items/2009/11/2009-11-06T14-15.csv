But it does challenge OP's statement (which I italicized) that he uses as a basis for his conclusions.<p>I fully agree that iterative analysis and development is usually quicker than the waterfall method.  I'm just adding that a little thought <i>each step of the process</i> can make everything quicker.  If you think things through enough (which more experienced people often do better), you <i>can</i> have your cake and eat it too.",1257519562

I've only recently gotten into development (< 3 years) and my biggest complaint about the development world is all the fighting between languages, frameworks, etc. I credit Rails with being the reason I was able to get into development in the first place - it made web development extremely accessible to people like me with little to no app development experience.<p>So all that said, I really appreciate the author's candor. The negative attacks people make against other frameworks and languages really discourage people who are just getting started with this stuff because it casts doubt in their minds about whether or not they bet on the right horse. I may actually play around with Django now to see what it's all about.",1257519555

All these handset makers can compete with each other on pricing, features, performance and design and not worry about the OS or developing their own third party application library. I don't think Android will fully Windows-ize the handset market though because both Apple and RIM are very strong. It could go 20/20/20 with the last 20% being a mix-mash of WebOS, Windows Mobile, etc. I think Nokia will jump on the Android train sooner or later. Maybe Palm as well. The way things are heading I'm not sure Windows Mobile is going to even exist in a few years.

paper about it.

It's common to use a tagged tuple, like { point, 1.5638, -2.4144 }, for informal type annotations, but they're not mandatory.<p>Another significant difference between Erlang vs. Haskell and OCaml is that since Erlang is dynamically typed, it can far more easily accommodate incremental changes without having to stop it. Doing static validation of changing types in a running, <i>distributed</i> system adds major complexity, with many of the same problems as handling schema changes in a database.

Predominantly this is Canada, the UK, and the US. While programs such as the US ""no child left behind"" has been an educational disaster, this has been a problem for years. Schools have a limited, and shrinking, budget. The student population isn't getting any smaller so as an educator your options are to cut funding to a bunch of smart, but bored students, or cut funding to the lowest levels. In one instance you might be denying the next Bill Gates. In another you might be keeping someone from turning to a life of crime.<p>Usually from the same immigrant families, they will complain about the education their children receive in the host country but if pressed to send the children back, even if just for school, most would rather take their chances in their new country.",1257518714

Most code I saw was incredibly bad, written by programmers who knew they would switch groups or companies, or go into management, before they had to seriously maintain it. Programmers I met who worked in an ""enterprise"" were not into their work. Few of them knew of anything outside of their prescribed Java or sometimes C++, or followed anything new or interesting in their field. I could mention something like The Mythical Man-Month, or talk about looking up an answer in Knuth, and get blank stares. Explaining closures to all but a couple was like talking to a wall. This was at a top-tier company, in one of the most prestigious groups in its IT organization.<p>I think real experience and talent as a programmer shines in the ability to find a solution which is both correct and takes the same amount of time to write as garbage. This is not always possible, of course, but I would caution against coding without thinking about this trade-off.<p>In the case of the original article, the author cites the foreign key debate.

The people who really enjoy school math, doing sums, applying equestions, get to university and find it's really hard and abstract and switch courses or drop out.  The ones who might be really good at university style math get bored, disengaged, and don't do math at university, never suspecting that it's completely different.<p>The problem is that school math is trying to accomplish two things at once, and they're at odds with each other.<p>On the one hand, regular people who go on to regular jobs need numeracy and some facility to understand graphs, sums, and to follow a line of reasoning.<p>On the other hand, anyone going on to the sciences needs a good background in (school-type) algebra, some geometry, a little calculus, and some statistics.  Way more than most people need in everyday life.<p>The latter group also needs a glimpse of some cool stuff to keep them interested.  That's why in the UK there are math masterclasses, ""Maths Inspiration"", Further Maths, and other groups that try to get kids interested.",1257517837

QM is a special case of quantum electrodynamics, which is a low-energy special case of the Grand Unified Theory.""<p>Somewhat misleading. The difference between quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics is not really pertinent to a discusion of the limits of quantum mechanics. Most people who are familiar with quantum mechanics will use the term to refer to the whole tree of theories that require quantization anyway (quantum mechanics (QM), quantum field theory (QFT)). The limits of QM is that we are really not able to calculate things in certain energy regimes.<p>Also, it is not really accurate to call QM a special case of QFT because different things are being quantized (particle states vs field states). Certain operators in QFT are then interpreted as particles.<p>Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is an example of a QFT. People postulate the existence of a Grand Unified Theory (GUT), of which QED would be special case. The only evidence of the GUT is a plot that extrapolates the strength of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions over many orders of magnitude.",1257517145

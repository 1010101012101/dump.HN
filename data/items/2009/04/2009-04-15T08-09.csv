Beta tested with advertising community"".<p>Looking at the rest of the claims he makes, nearly all are obvious at the time that they were made.<p>Obvious is defined as ""would another developer given the same problem create the same solution"", if so then there has been no inventive step and the patent should be dismissed.

I've never lived in the Valley, or in any other stereotypical ""tech hub"" though, so I could be wrong there.<p>I'm currently working for what I consider to be a startup in a small town in the UK. We're making software that is applicable to a specific industry, and the industry is <i>very</i> hungry for it. I'm currently the only programmer.<p>What looks like the probable course for us (and probably for other people like us - people starting up software dev stuff in smaller areas), is that once we've sold what we're working on right now, we'll probably move on to doing more interesting things, and form a small software development house of sorts.<p>What we're doing right now would be utterly impossible without the internet, if only due to communication-over-distance issues.<p>I think that the stereotypical ""startup"" is just the start of what we'll continue to see as more and more people realize that they can make their livelihood online. What I'm doing doesn't fit the stereotypical startup mold, but is the type of thing that I think we'll see more and more of, assuming nothing majorly bad happens to the internet or society in general.",1239784038

A brilliant MIT student working 20 hour days on some silly mash-up is not nearly as productive as a slow and obtuse engineer in some large corporation working 6 hours days.  It's the results that count.<p>I would argue the contrary case to Paul's; I think that Silicon Valley has slowed down growth.  They make it a lottery that you can win with having a cool, quick hit.

This project isn&#x27;t really _ready_ yet, but I&#x27;m happy to answer questions.<p>I actually wrote some more stuff yesterday, but since it&#x27;s on HN... just deployed it anyway. I was on a long bus ride home from my parents&#x27; house, and didn&#x27;t have any internet, so there&#x27;s a bunch of notes to fill things out and double check stuff... I have some stuff to do today, but am hoping to clean that up by tonight.<p>Here&#x27;s a sort of synopsis: there&#x27;s been a lot of really great stuff going on in the Rust OSDev space lately, and I managed to get my own little OS going, with a VGA driver and keyboard input. You can see that source here: <a href=""https://github.com/intermezzOS/kernel/tree/original_backup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/intermezzOS/kernel/tree/original_backup</a><p>But then I realized that one of the reasons I&#x27;ve struggled a lot here in the past was the lack of tutorials. And I love writing. Christmas three years ago was when I discovered Rust, started writing about it, and is why I have the job I do today. So I decided this break that I&#x27;d embark on another project...<p>I really, truly think that many high-level programmers could do operating systems development if there were more resources that catered to them. Hence this project. Once it&#x27;s got some polish, I hope that someone who has learned programming through JavaScript can follow along and have their own little OS too.",1451228247

Then for weeks there is nearly no Ops at all (security updates only mostly while the servers are humming) with releases done with Docker push by developers. Adding and provisioning a new VPS takes some seconds (and some seconds later checking), with Consul the stuff running on the VPS usually integrates itself). Sometimes hardware breaks down, then it&#x27;s either setup a new VPS (setup_server <IP> <Role>) which takes around 5sec or mail the hoster if it&#x27;s a DB server with a (mirrored RAID) SSD crash, which takes around 2h to fix all in all. So on average per year I&#x27;d guess 0,2 Ops FTE (which equals 10 weeks a year, which is a lot if you&#x27;re not Facebook and don&#x27;t need to do releases of new app versions). Today ops is relativly easy with a well trodden path, it&#x27;s not 1999.<p>The Salt is of the shelf, with some bash scripts on top to auto generate some config and make installation of a new server one script call.<p>We surely could put endless hours into Ops, playing around with stuff etc. but the benefit would be marginal.<p>Our DNS setup is simple, not much to say, we use DNS Made Easy for failover, we use S3 though I do not consider it &quot;AWS&quot; (S3 is comparativly cheap).<p>I&#x27;ve wondered about Mesosphere with autoscaling etc. but with adding a new VPS in seconds setting up Mesosphere/Kubernetes taking two weeks would take quite some time to amortize.",1451226562

Arts, music, robotics, programming, puzzles and so  much more.  The goal was to help my kids find something to be passionate about.<p>My oldest just graduated with a degree in sociology which is not one of the most employable degrees for an undergraduate. She is working part time in a library and living at home.  She was meant to be a librarian and all that know her, know that about her. She has to be get a Masters of Library Science to be a librarian.  She will have to put in two or so years at the library she works at to go full time without the MLS.  So she stays with us and puts in the time. The good news is that she knows what she wants to do the rest of her life and to be severely dyslexic and be in a library is just awesome. Her mom and I are fine with her living at home till she can be full time since she is a saver and is responsible.<p>And as a person that has had mostly STEM related careers that I have loved, my youngest seems to be moving towards mechanical engineering next year.  I love this about her as it warms my STEM heart.<p>Most important is that both seem to have found their passions. If you love your work you will likely be in the flow some and who can ask for more than that out of a career.  After building several businesses my current employment gives me the opportunity to do what I love (programming and systems integration) and be in the flow.  I could not be happier at work and I want that for my kids. Passion alignment is a great thing.<p>EDIT: And my youngest has some graphic design and art talent which I am sure will help her be a better design engineer.  She was in doubt in high school if she should juggle the art and design classes along with her tech speciality center IT classes.  We supported the extra work simply for the benefit of her love for creating art and design.",1451226303

10797491,comment,10795399,10795399,0,0,saurik,,,"I run an ecosystem of tens of millions of &quot;end users&quot; who are working with a GUI package manager I developed (Cydia) built on APT (using libapt). We stress APT to its limit, with users often using very large numbers (thirty is common, but I have seen well over a hundred) repositories that are often hosted by random people of varying skill at IT (and so tend to be slow or have errors in their metadata; DNS errors and 200 OK HTML error pages abound).<p>We have so many non- and semi- skilled people using APT that if you Google many APT errors, you actually tend to come across people using Cydia as the primary people discussing the error condition ;P. Our package churn and update rate is faster than Debian, and we have run into all of the arbitrary limits in various versions of APT (total number of packages known about, total number of delete versions, total number of bytes in the cache): really, we use APT <i>a lot</i>.<p>1) Despite APT supporting cumulative diffs (where the client gets a single diff from the server to bring them up to date rather than downloading a ton of tiny incremental updates and applying them in sequence), Debian&#x27;s core repositories are not configured to generate these. I can tell you from experience that providing cumulative diffs is seriously important.<p>So, while a 20x speed-up applying a diff is cool and all, users of Debian&#x27;s servers are doing this 20x more often that they need to, applying diff after diff after diff to get the final file. This is an example of an optimization at a low-level that may or may not be useful as the real issue is at the higher-level in the algorithm design.<p>What is extra-confusing is that the most popular repository management tool, reprepro, can build cumulative diffs automatically, and I think it does so by default. Debian really should switch to using this feature: I keep seeing Debian users complain on forums and blog posts that APT diff updates are dumb as you end up downloading 30 files... no: the real issue is that debian isn&#x27;t using their own tool well :(.<p>2) The #1 performance issue I deal with while using APT even on my server is the amount of time it takes to build the cache file every time there is a package update. It sits there showing you a percentage as it does this on the console. On older iPhones this step was absolutely brutal. This step was taking some of my users <i>minutes</i>, but again: that is the step I most notice on my server.<p>I spent a week working on this years ago, and made drastic improvements. I determined most of the time was spent in &quot;paper cuts&quot;: tiny memory allocations and copies distributed through the entire project which over the course of running the code hemorrhaged all the time.<p>The culprit (of course ;P) was std::string. As a 20-year user of C++ who spent five years in the PC gaming industry, I hate std::string (and most of STL really: std::map is downright idiotic.. it allocates memory even if you never put anything into the map, and I can tell you from writing my own C++ red-black tree tools that there is no good reason for this).<p>Sure, maybe APT is using C++11 by now and has a bunch of move constructors all over the place that mitigate the issue somewhat (I haven&#x27;t looked recently), but it still feels &quot;weirdly slow&quot; to do this step on my insanely fast server (where by all rights it should be instantaneous) and frankly: APT&#x27;s C++ code when I was last seriously looking at the codebase was abysmal. It was essentially written against one of the very first available versions of C++ by someone who didn&#x27;t really know much about the language (meaning it uses all the bad parts and none of the good; this happens when Java programmers try to use C++98, for example, but APT is much much worse) and has no rhyme or reason to a lot of the design. It reminds me a little of WebKit&#x27;s slapped together &quot;hell of random classes and pointers that constantly leads to use-after-free bugs&quot;.<p>Regardless, I rewrote almost every single usage of std::string in the update path to use a bare pointer and a size and pass around fragments of what had been memory mapped from the original file whenever possible without making any copies. I got to be at least twice if not four times faster (I don&#x27;t remember). I made the code entirely unmaintable while doing this, though, and so I have never felt my patches were worth even trying to merge back (though it also took me years to ever find the version control repository where APT was developed anyway... ;P). To this day I ship some older version of APT that I forked rather than updating to something newer, due to a combination of this and the gratuitous-and-unnecessary ABI breakage in APT (they blame using C++, but that isn&#x27;t quite right: the primary culprit is their memory-mapped cache format, and rather than use tricks when possible to maintain the ABI for it they just break it with abandon; but even so, the C++ is buying me as a user absolutely nothing: they should give me a thin C API to their C++ core.)<p>If I were to do this again &quot;for real&quot; I would spend the time to build some epic string class designed especially for APT, but I just haven&#x27;t needed to do this as my problem is now &quot;sort of solved well enough&quot; as I almost have never cared about the new features that have been added to APT, and I have back ported the few major bug fixes I needed (and frankly have much better error correction now in my copy, which is so unmaintainably drifted due to this performance patch as to not be easily mergable back :/ but we really really need APT to never just give up entirely or crash if a repository is corrupt, and so they are also critical for us in a way they aren&#x27;t for Debian or Ubuntu).<p>If anyone is curious what these miserable patches look like, here you go... check out &quot;tornado&quot; in particular. (Patches are applied by my build system in alphabetical order.) (Actually, I have been reading through my tornado patch and I actually did at some point while working on it build a tiny custom string class to help abstract the fix, but I assuredly didn&#x27;t do it well or anything. I really only point any of this maintainability issue out at all, by the way, as I don&#x27;t want people to assume that performance fundamentally comes at the price of unmaintainable implementations.)<p><a href=""http://svn.telesphoreo.org/trunk/data/_apt7/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svn.telesphoreo.org/trunk/data/_apt7/</a>",1451225649

Increasing the size of the software industry will naturally result in much greater specialization, with high-skill folks solving the hardest problems and farming out the easier stuff to low-skill people.  Likewise, in the early days everyone needed to know how to fix most things in their car, and car mechanics had to be real experts. Now most car driver can&#x27;t change their oil, car mechanics are following instructions given to them by the car&#x27;s computer without much idea of how those decisions get made, but inside car companies there are guys with deep insight about how to electronically balance your engine.",1451225077

One gap year, okay so that is fine.  But 8 years.  My wife and I are looking forward to eventual retirement and want some control over our bank account.  Eight years would put college payments solidly into my retirement years.<p>So from a practical standpoint cash flow is a consideration.  From a dependency standpoint isn&#x27;t eight years long enough for you to mature beyond financial and emotional dependency?",1451224973

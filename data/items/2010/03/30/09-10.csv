I think it's probably a waste of time by the OP really - like delirium said, they get probably 4-6% of the sale, right? If it's a $12 book (a popular amount for business books), they earn $0.60 per sale. If they cause 10 sales, they earn $6. I would think that it is rare that there are more than 10 sales via an affiliate link on HN but I could be way off. But really - even 100 sales is ""just"" $60.<p>Waste of time if you ask me.",1269943188

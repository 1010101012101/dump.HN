2183249,comment,2181315,2183137,0,0,waterhouse,,,"> <i>Mostly I see polite disagreement in this topic.</i><p>A numerical majority of comments are probably polite, yes, but here are some quotes...<p><pre><code>  ""Your reply is so laced with hypocrisy its disgusting.""
  ""Talk about arrogance...and ignorance.""
  ""I really hope you are kidding. If not this is so typical...""
</code></pre>
Next, you say: <i>""If we're putting words in mouths, it's because those words are the natural conclusion proceeded to upon viewing the actually mouthed words from the opposite perspective.""</i><p>Obviously that wasn't the conclusion of the person who holds this opposite perspective.  If you think their words imply a monstrous conclusion, then either they must be a monster, or their thought process leads to a different conclusion, and if you want to carry out a constructive conversation, you should assume the latter and press them.  Here's a part of my above post that I didn't include, but I will now:<p>--<p>Probably it would help if you a) noticed when you read things into comments (be on your guard when discussing politics or morals) and b) explicitly said so when you addressed a claim someone didn't make.  For example, d3x could have said something like, ""You say that our lives are so much better than theirs, that contact with primitive cultures destroys those cultures, that you'd have to be a flaming idiot to want to live like that....  Do you therefore advocate forcing them to live like us?  [You could answer that by reading the third paragraph of Markham's post--""let them decide""--but perhaps d3x thought that was a sarcastic quip, which I suppose is believable.  Another tip for navigating rocky topics: don't assume sarcasm unless you're quite sure.]  If so, then I've got a lot to say about that.  <insert text of d3x's original post>  If not, then precisely what do you advocate?""<p>And then DanielBMarkham could have said something like... well, I'm not him and I don't speak for him, but perhaps he'd say something like, ""No, I don't advocate that.  What do I advocate?  Well, I don't prescribe a particular course of action, but let's take an example.  A group of people who felt generous might visit them in a boat, set up a demonstration of modern technology on the shore, and offer to teach anything to natives who wanted to learn.""<p>And maybe d3x would reply, ""They'd just stay on the shore, teaching them and getting nothing in return?  Who'd be that generous?  They'd only do it if they had an ulterior motive--to convert them to their religion, to get cheap unskilled labor from them, to trick them into selling their natural resources for much less than they're worth, and everything else that's gone wrong in the past.""<p>And maybe Markham would say, ""Oh, snap, that's a problem,"" or he'd say ""Maybe a rich billionaire who felt charity-minded (or PR-minded) would fund the whole effort, and these teachers would follow through with it because they'd be paid,"" or he'd say ""Dude, doing unskilled labor for a price that's ridiculously cheap to us might look like horrible exploitation to you, but in fact it's better than the lives they currently lead.  The fact that they <i>choose</i> it over their current lives is <i>proof</i> that it's better, unless you wish to argue that you know better than them, which is hypocritical given your earlier argument.""  But this is just me talking now.<p>--<p>Regarding guns: I <i>would</i> recommend being careful and slow about giving them war materials (or the capability to make them) in case one party gets hold of them and attempts to conquer the rest of the island.  But it's not a moral/legal <i>imperative</i>, any more than it is to be careful about introducing college kids to alcohol.  (People may hate you if you do it badly, but they can't really stop or punish you.)  I'll comment that any civilization that advances in science and has access to plentiful resources will eventually develop all sorts of weapons, including guns; and that the developments of fire, bronze, iron, steel, flight, nuclear physics, and many more things all led to weapons as well as productive tools, and I think it was worth it.<p>Disease is the objection I find most potentially problematic.  Also, one part of me says it would be interesting to let them be so we could <i>watch</i> them, <i>study</i> them; another part says that if I knew someone in there, and she was sick with a disease that modern medicine could cure, I would sure as hell want to save her.  Or if I knew someone working his butt off, and I knew I could give him some technological tools that would make it ten times easier for him, I'd do that.<p>I think that's the best way it can happen: if some individual people from one society are connected with some individual people in the other, and they get and use some advanced things whenever they feel the need.  Then their neighbors might see the results, decide they want some advanced things too, and try to work out a way to get them.  Maybe a few families would want to send their (young adult) kids out to the advanced society so they could stay for a while, learn things and get things, and bring them back home.  Or maybe they'd move out <i>with</i> their kids, young children, and raise their family and run a career for a decade or two, periodically sending gifts and maybe visiting their extended family in the old country, perhaps moving back eventually.  You know, this is sounding a good deal like what some immigrants from poor countries to the U.S. do <i>today</i>.",1296920727

2183245,comment,2182303,2183138,0,0,sp4rki,,,"This is very uncommon from blue collar agencies and downwards, but actually an expected service of more upscale agencies and/or freelancer prostitutes. Really expensive escorts sleep with less men in 10 years than really cheap ones in a year or two. Also, it's a given that sexually transmitted diseases are less common in men that belong to the social class willing to spend two thousand dollars for company, therefore they're also less common in the prostitutes this men frequent.<p>There is one thing that you should have in mind though. An escort (whom doesn't mind the unprotected sex) can and will say no to condom less sex a lot of time if the client looks like a shady character that saved 5k for a few months to get the date, when she doesn't know the customer in one way or another, or if she detects the slightest irregularity in the guy's penis' smell or appearance. Condom less sex in upscale operations is a normal thing, but it's almost exclusively done between an inner circle of regular clients, and in some operations all the participants are required to have current blood work and std exams in which they prove they're std free.<p>It's really a game of quality and quantity. The inherent risk is always there, but trust me, you're more likely to get an std from a random hookup at a high scale bar than from the prostitute your governor uses.<p>There are also lower end prostitutes that charge more for condom less sex. This are std and aids infested petri dishes. They're not that common, but are always women down on their luck and are generally addicts.",1296920626

I'm sure this will take time and won't happen over night, but I've had serval web ideas that have been started by companys and plenty more that haven't. So I figured instead of trying to find a tech, I could teach myself and get to work. I love tech and web but never went to school. Its my dream to see my ideas infront of me rather just in my head.

Frequent vaccines are very common for people with cystic fibrosis (which is what I have).  People with CF get sicker and sicker until they die.  It is a slow, torturous gruesome thing.  For me, it became apparent that drugs and vaccines were causing me harm and contributing to my decline.  I worked hard to get off the drugs and I stopped getting vaccines.   I am drug free. The hole in my lung has closed.  I am getting my life back.  Doctors told me ""People like you don't get well.  Symptom management is the name of the game.""<p>For me, there came a point where I had a clear choice between the certain path of doom and the risky path of maybe getting better.  I was so miserable, death would have been a welcome alternative to the future ahead of me.  I felt it was win/win: Either do something really stupid and die quickly or gradually get better.  Both options held more appeal for me than what doctors and all the world were promising me.<p>I can't recall the last time I had a cold.

I will try and reiterate here:<p>* I urge nobody to trust a protest tool that is closed. Where is the source? Where is the documentation on its architecture? The official line is:<p>""It has always been our plan to make the code open source. Security is paramount and we feel it would benefit from being released to the public after each protest.""<p>I'm sorry but retrospective release of source code is simply not good enough. Security software (which this is, essentially) needs to be out in the open from the start. Not after a protest has happened and all data collected. The wider community must be able to audit this software before it can be trusted. No exceptions.<p>* If the security depends on secrecy <i>before</i> a protest, is it dependant on a random seed? Can this seed be extracted from a binary (IPA, for example)?<p>* Sukey has one of the worst pages on ""security"" I have ever read (see <a href=""http://sukey.org/security"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sukey.org/security</a>). To paraphrase:<p>""The team members involved on the security side are a mix of commercial information security experts and computer nerd under/post graduates who love nothing better than a complex algorithm.""<p>That scares me. Complex algorithms are not normally conducive to secure applications. I want to hear about cryptographers - not computer nerds. I want to know what crypto implementations you are using.<p>Continuing:<p>""One of our key team members has technical commercial data security patents in his name and has provided information security consultancy to IBM, Lockheed Martin, and to the NHS.""<p>Let's have a citation then please. Who is this expert and what (where?) are the granted patents?<p>""Your data is safe with Sukey.""<p>Okay, prove it.<p>* How can we prove the application distributed on the App Store matches that which we (hopefully, in future) have the source for? Is there a mechanism for which we could compare checksums - if the provisioning certificates were also published? This needs to be considered. There is more to trust than merely publishing a source tree.<p>Let me finally restate my original point: I commend the effort (and I was once involved in a similar application). However, these are serious concerns that need to be addressed.",1296918189

9216879,comment,9208897,9212444,0,0,kelnos,,,"I don&#x27;t think the problem is that I don&#x27;t understand capitalism; I just believe that the absolute application of it can be harmful in some cases.<p>I&#x27;ll start by saying that I <i>do</i> believe that capitalism is pretty much the best we have right now, and has allowed for greater prosperity than other economic systems up to this point.<p>However, I do think that the public good needs to be taken into account and act as a balance for capitalism sometimes.  Housing is a good example for this, as I don&#x27;t believe the public good is served by allowing property owners to charge as much as they can.  Call that socialist if you want; so be it... I do have some socialist leanings.<p>If we were to repeal rent control tomorrow, rents would shoot up across the board.  Formerly rent-controlled apartments would see their rents go up like crazy. Formerly non-rent-controlled apartments might see rent increases slow, but they would almost certainly not drop, at least not for a year or two.  Demand is still high (and is still getting higher), and the bay area increasingly houses people who really want to live in SF, and are able to afford higher rents.  SF is limited in land area, so, without a massive increase in the housing supply, we&#x27;re limited in population expansion.  With the average & median rent increasing, many people at the low end will be displaced.  SF will become a place where only high earners can live, which means most service workers will need to move out of the city and be bused in, or drive, or just fail to find jobs due to lack of transportation options.<p>That last bit is an example of why I think the public good needs to (through regulation) balance out capitalism sometimes.  Lower-income people being unable to live in SF is IMO a bad thing.  Increasing the number of cars/buses on the road is a bad thing; causing people to live farther away from their jobs is economically wasteful.  Also note that many of the high-income people moving into SF in this scenario will be moving to SF while keeping their peninsula/south bay jobs, further increasing the commute problem.<p>Definitely agree that regulation and new laws do sometimes form a feedback loop as unintended consequences and loopholes are discovered.  But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an excuse not to try, because a lightly- or un-regulated market is not going to help, either.",1426582732

9216844,comment,9208897,9212018,0,0,kelnos,,,"Hey, this all started with a question by someone asking if making your renters unable to afford their rent to fulfill a profit motive makes one an asshole.  I said yes.<p>So what <i>do</i> we do to address the problem at hand?  It sounds like you&#x27;d advocate for a repeal of rent control, because landlords should be able to extract all the profit they can from their properties?  That&#x27;s not going to fix the housing supply issue; all it&#x27;s going to do is turn SF into a rich-people-only city where service workers need to live elsewhere and get bused in every day.  That&#x27;s not a place I want to live, and would be a direct result of &quot;market forces&quot; -- but not <i>really</i>, because government regulation nullifies market forces in many cases.  Rent control is only one part of it... prop 13 and the city&#x27;s byzantine planning process are others, and there are certainly more.<p>So, looking for suggestions?  Here&#x27;s what we do:<p>1. Gut the city&#x27;s construction planning process.  Make it more objective and based on zoning laws and building codes, as well as continuing to include provisions for low-income housing.  Raise (and in some areas eliminate) building-height restrictions.  Also, residents in the area no longer get a veto on new construction projects.  As long as a building proposal follows the rules, it gets a rubber stamp.  No discussion.<p>2. Repeal prop 13 for rental properties, and only allow it to apply to an owner&#x27;s primary residence (obviously this is more difficult since prop 13 is state and not city law).  This recognizes that owning a home gives you an illiquid asset, and fluctuations in property taxes (especially in an area like SF with strongly rising property values) can cause people to need to move.  Homeownership should at least still offer that kind of security.<p>3. Repeal rent control city-wide and replace it with a gov&#x27;t subsidy tied to renters&#x27; income.  This subsidy can be funded with extra tax revenue from #2, and can likely be phased out over several years as rents stabilize and drop.  I expect that rents will initially rise, but will start to lower again after a year or two under the new rules, and even more after a few more years as #1 reduces (and hopefully eliminates) the deficit in the housing supply.  The (temporary) subsidy protects existing tenants until there&#x27;s enough housing to support people of any economic status.<p>4. This is more subjective, but: make it more attractive for landlords to buy out their tenants (or just keep them) than to use shady practices like finding reclassification loopholes and bullying by doing the bare minimum required by law to maintain their properties.  I&#x27;m not sure of the exact mechanisms to do this, but incentives should be aligned so that landlords <i>want</i> to keep good, steady, reliable tenants, even if new tenants might net them some extra cash.  Basically we want to create an environment where landlords are mostly happy to keep their current tenants, but while tenants are also not afraid of the prospect of needing to move.<p>Is that helpful enough?",1426581767

Whether or not they <i>should</i> is another matter, but I think the state of rentals here -- especially among rent-controlled units -- serves only to reinforce the belief that a rental can (and &quot;should&quot;) be as permanent as the renter wants it to be.  And it&#x27;s a feedback loop: people believe this because of renter protections, which causes them to believe and fight for (and often get) even stronger renter protections, which allows their rental status to become even more &quot;permanent&quot;, and so on.<p>Again, not saying it&#x27;s right (or wrong), but I can easily see how the sentiment in SF is that renting need not be a permanent thing.",1426580190

SF is geographically constrained in such a way that there isn&#x27;t really a way to build more housing within commuting distance.  A city like Omaha (or even Berlin) has the available land go up with the square of the commuting time.  SF has the land available for development go up roughly linearly (the valley doesn&#x27;t get much wider until all the way to San Jose)<p>The way to lower housing costs is to increase the available housing as a function of commuting time.  The easiest way to do this is high speed rail.<p>It&#x27;s not a coincidence that all the communities in the valley have fought tooth and nail against high speed rail.<p><a href=""http://www.cahsrblog.com/2011/04/anti-hsr-activism-is-a-rich-mans-movement/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cahsrblog.com/2011/04/anti-hsr-activism-is-a-rich...</a><p>Once it becomes possible to get to SF from Gilroy in 40 minutes, tons of housing will be built far from the city, where land is available and cheap.  People won&#x27;t have to choose between paying a huge premium to avoid a long commute, or spending 3 hours of every day sitting in a car.<p>This is economics 101.  The marginal property is south of San Jose, and the premium for living in SF is about 2 hours * 20 days of commute time a month, which if you are making $200k per year is about $4166 of lost time per month, assuming a 40 hour work week and ability to convert that time into salary (a bad assumption, but this is the actual analysis to figure out how much more prices should be in SF, it just doesn&#x27;t factor everything in appropriately).

The article states it as a given without data or addressing regional effects. There are at least some well-to-do individuals who would purchase non-luxury housing in the North Bay, Berkeley, and the Peninsula rather than SF proper. You can obviously point to activity in  places like the Mission and Bernal Heights, but at least some of the demand for unbuilt SF waterfront condos is going to go to the Oakland waterfront rather than something more inland. You can re-model your home, but you can&#x27;t re-model your neighborhood.<p>Even if gentrification is a given though, the timing isn&#x27;t. SF interest groups are pretty good at slowing things down (whether that&#x27;s new development or a purchase and re-model). Presumably there&#x27;s some difference in utility to the rich of buying luxury housing and buying non-luxury housing and remodeling it (otherwise there wouldn&#x27;t be much demand for luxury housing). That&#x27;s leverage the poor have in extracting some kind of negotiated benefit, like better public transit, education rights, re-distributive taxes, and so forth.",1426579613

To turn that into cash, they have to move.

Prop 13 helps to reinforce that security, delaying the property tax increases to the point where the homeowner would be able to afford them -- at moving time.  It&#x27;s certainly not perfect, but I&#x27;m not convinced repealing prop 13 is the answer.<p>Perhaps a hybrid approach: live-in owners are subject to prop 13 caps on increases, but rental properties are not?

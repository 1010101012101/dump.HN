At that point you can kind of extrapolate the myriad of possibilities available with the paradigm.",1202702234

113202,comment,113057,113131,0,0,tx,,,"Just pay attention to what you are reading. The problem of micro-payments has been voiced many times on YC news, PG himself mentioned it in one of his writings. Yet it took forever for TipJoy to materialize.<p>Why? Because of all the details. When I first saw this obvious micro-payments problem I thought about it for about 30 seconds but did not come up with anything significantly different than PayPal. I moved on, but someone decided to spend more than 30 seconds on it.",1202700664

113200,comment,112899,113170,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Also it depends on how you look at it. By some metrics of ""best"" there are clear leaders. For instance, if your goal in college is to land a job running a hedge fund afterwards, it's pretty clear you should get a Harvard MBA. The title and connections you get from there are far more important than any classes.",1202700519
113199,comment,113184,113184,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"Interesting article.  I'm at Gonzaga University right now, and they're definitely riding this bandwagon.  They've got a campus in Florence and they're working on ramping up another one in the UK and, if rumors hold true, one in Spain.  At the moment it's all European, but that's mainly because they've been opening them near areas where there's a ready supply of Jesuits to teach.  (GU's a Jesuit university.)  I'll be interested to see where this trend goes in the next few years.<p>Interestingly, it doesn't seem just to be Universities that are reaching abroad in the academic/intellectual realm.  A LOT of nations right now seem to be pushing international R&D collaboration.  This is especially true for the Middle Eastern and East Asian countries.<p>Seed magazine has had a several really good articles in the past few issues about various countries looking to forge international research ties.",1202700504

113196,comment,113185,113185,0,0,danteembermage,,,"I think the point is that the utility curve for consumption flattens out a lot faster than people think. The difference between starving and a good cheeseburger is probably a lot bigger than the difference between the cheeseburger and an immaculate dinner overlooking the Thames.<p>Granting that it seems pretty rational to just settle with the four-times pricier television and leave the rest to the grandchildren or charity.<p>There are of course exceptions, e.g. someone really should have talked to Mike Tyson about the diminishing marginal utility of Bengal tigers.",1202699826

113194,comment,113067,113067,0,0,Frocer,,,"I am very glad Yahoo rejected Microsoft's bid.  Personally, I think the bid is undervalued, and Yahoo has too much potential to monetized its massive traffic. Jerry Yang is taking Yahoo towards the right direction -- streamline operation and cutting unnecessary headcount.  And I think next step is to focus on its core strength.<p>Microsoft is likely to bid higher, probably no more than $36-$38/share.  I sure hope Yahoo's board doesn't give in to  the temptation!",1202699097
113193,comment,113122,113122,0,0,thorax,,,"I really want to see this allow sites to integrate TipJoy between their own users. If you offer a small, tiny cut to sites who do this, I think this will grow by leaps and bounds across the net. Imagine if you could leave a tip for some of the crazy cool comments people submit here on TC. I know I'd do it.<p>Encourage other companies to put TipJoy on their sites (by letting them have a percentage of peer-to-peer donations) and everyone wins, especially you.",1202698816

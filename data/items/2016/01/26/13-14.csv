We compiled a large panel data set on executives\nand formed a career hierarchy to analyze promotion and compensation rates. Given\nexecutive rank and background, women are paid more than men, experience less income\nuncertainty, and are promoted as quickly. Amongst survivors, being female increases\nthe chance of becoming CEO. Hence the gender pay gap and job rank differences are\nprimarily attributable to female executives attriting at higher rates than males in an\noccupation where survival is rewarded with promotion and higher compensation.</i>",1453816778

For something thats 20% hollow its also remarkably strong.<p>Its an example of a piece of technology that depends on numerous contemporary things.  You need razor sharp cutting tools to keep the pores open, so it has to be a &quot;post-carbide&quot; era tool.  You need a vacuum pump to fill the pores with oil.

10973344,comment,10972482,10972482,0,0,princeb,,,"Mathematics is hard to learn because the way classes and performance testing is done, there is often only one answer and until you get to the answer the question is not complete. the end state is binary - either the student was successful in it, or the student was not.<p>On the other hand, in a subject like history a student can make good ground towards an answer by laying down fundamental facts and then arguing and reasoning back and forth. Even with minimal facts the student may use some approximate recollection of events and still be able to build an argument. The answer may not be complete, and it may not even be good, but the final outcome has the appearance of being complete, and is often somewhat far from the starting point of nothing.<p>Humanities subjects use assessments that provide intermediate rewards for a student. Mathematics offer no such respite. That is what I believe makes it intimidating. Even worse, some questions have intermediate solutions look extremely hairy, leading the student to believe that he has gone further away from the solution. In such cases, the intermediate step has punished rather than reward!<p>Very often suggestions for improving mathematics pedagogy is to make use of &quot;open-ended&quot; questions that admit multiple solutions (as Marvin did here). I believe most of us who make these suggestions understand the effect that traditional maths questions have on a learner. These suggested questions are just like those in history or literature that allow students to have a decent go at it and still make progress.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I truly believe in the theory (hypothesis) that memorization makes it extremely boring. Until historical accounts are utilized in some argument (during a performance assessment), these are just empty facts to be memorized. And given the wide range of questions that can be asked in a history exam, the effort involved in memory work in history class seem to be more onerous and less rewarding. Yet I have seen students who are gifted in remembering in detail historical events, capable of building logical structures and narrative flow, and they struggle with maths. So clearly they must have committed a decent amount of effort to memorization - but not in maths but other subjects instead.<p>In any case, at the higher levels, rote work in mathematics is extremely important: it is very difficult to pursue an advanced class in probability theory without the basic tools picked up in real analysis, for example (that means all your theorems relating to sequences and continuity and functional analysis and so on). That usually involves some amount of &quot;practice&quot;, thinking and solving problem sets before moving on to more advanced topics.",1453816298

The reason now is that DF is the only party that really takes the average joes concerns seriously no matter how primitive they might seem to many.<p>Today most parties are in line with DF as they have recognized that you can&#x27;t just take in a lot of people and then expect them to become a natural part of society.<p>Denmark has one of the most honest debates about immigration and it speaks volume about the level of political corectness and control over the media in other countries that even though Denmark is one of the countries who take most immigrants and refugees, spend most money on immigration both domestically and internationally and has some of the most extensive rights for immigrants it still had to defend it&#x27;s political line in the EU.<p>Denmark is fairly clear on what it&#x27;s doing.

I personally would have put him straight in the center, as more of a pragmatist. One of the big criticisms he had (from my memory of the Society of Mind lectures) is that some researchers spent too much time trying to find an overarching, simplistic theory of mind (some sort of physics-envy), which would put him in the scruffy camp. I do also remember him saying that trying to replicate the brain was pointless and that people should focus on trying to replicate its function rather than its architecture, which I am assuming is a criticism of the connectionist approaches, which would put him in the neat camp.",1453813445

But math&#x27;s honestly just felt like imitating a machine or a robot. Completely mechanical, it just became a competition of making sure you could make the fewest mistakes in the upcoming exam versus your colleagues.<p>A majority of it is memorisation, which makes it both very easy in some respects, and hard in others.

It basically says that if an algorithm performs well on a certain class of learning, searching or optimization problems, then it necessarily pays for that with degraded performance on the set of all remaining problems.<p>In other words, you always need bias to learn meaningfully. More you have (the right kind of) bias, faster you can learn the subject in hand and slower in all other kinds.   In neural networks the bias is not just the weights. There is bias in the selection of random distribution of the network weights (uniform, Gaussian etc.) There is bias in the network topology. There is bias in the learning algorithm, activation function, etc.<p>Convolutional neural networks are good example. They have very strong  bias baked into them and it works really well.",1453813265

It acts as a button, as well (I'm not sure if it's a soft button, though.)<p>I imagine that, if it <i>were</i> a soft button, someone could write, quite simply, a voice recorder program whose recording was toggled by that button. You could leave music running in the background, with the recorder running in the foreground, then press the button (both temporarily pausing the music at starting the recording), dictate your thought, and press the button again, at which point the music would resume.",1226778980

There could be set up a switch that, when flipped, moved from a ""use/dispose"" model to a ""use/recycle"" (under the literal meaning of the term ""re-cycle"") one. It would, of course, build a small buffer at the beginning so it wouldn't just be spraying the last of your shampoo all over you, but that would be the last of the new usage for the day, and it could last as long as you want--only as dirty as a bath, but in motion!",1226778753

365486,comment,365326,365326,0,0,h34t,,,"I have 'left the fold' of institutional support early and have been battling the devils (and enjoying the fruits) of independence, on-and-off for 5 years.<p>I think there is an enormous amount of amazing potential for ""super-empowered individuals"" to make headway whether in business, technology, or science. Tools are cheap, knowledge is easy to spread. I love being able to travel with a laptop etc. But social reality hasn't caught up yet to support these possibilities to their potential. In particular, I find we need much more social interaction and support than one gets by default as an independence (and this becomes painfully obvious especially after a few months of being out of the institution). We live in a society of solitude. Loneliness has never been so rampant. It is crucial to creative thinking, to memory performance, to cognition, to motivation, to everything. How do we create better environments for this, outside of universities/corporations? Social support is absolutely important and difficult to find. The longer you are away, the harder it is to find.<p>I have more thoughts on this but will have to get to it later.",1226778479

For all they have done wrong, the republicans, with control of one chamber would keep the dems from doing what they do wrong, which for a fiscal conservative like me is a lot.<p>Obama can easily reach out to the other half by acting like the person he ran as (a moderate and at times conservative dem - something he is not), however, he doesn't have to be too liberal with the people running the house and senate. He can let them do his dirty work.",1226778466

365474,comment,364882,364882,0,0,Fuca,,,"Some thoughts about being there (back on rat race as now):<p>- You will feel better right away, what you said about being free its excatly right, and you realize how depressing was being trap on a cubicule kissing ass.<p>- Money is much easier to get, you realize that a salary is peanuts compared with how much you can do on your own if you make it.<p>- Live like a cockroach, the thing about not knowing where or if my next check will come make me realize I could live (and save money!) with half of what I made with a weekly salary, and in the past I was under credit card debt for going out meals and worthless stuff.<p>-You will find out that the urgency and strees to find an income will be a great motivation to make it. That is one of the biggest disadvantages in a job you do not have that feeling and that is probably what really makes the difference on the long run.<p>-Be honest to yourself and decide what you do ASAP, think it thru and once you decide give it all. Be quick on this on 2 things: to see if the field you choose have future and to move to try another thing fast, make sure you go into vocation whatever it may be.<p>-Dont fool yourself into laziness, have an area free of distractions and give it all. Family can suck all your time if you do not have clear boundaries and scheduale.<p>Little bit of my story:<p>- I was lay off in march, decided to sell some products, realized my bussiness model was not possible on the long run (I was not the owner of what I sell, mostly like an employee), but it gave me half of what I used to make on an office, and much better life, lots of free time.<p>If I had the same opportunity, I will have an ""office"" and scheduale, decide on a bussiness for the long run, not just to make money fast, be honest on doing what I liked even if took some time.<p>Good luck making it.",1226777453

365466,comment,365293,365345,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"An ""old"" method used to be to put individual items on notecards.  These could be rearranged repeatedly, with additional cards inserted as ideas were either fleshed out or fit into a larger context.<p>It's writing, but not (yet) writing a linear, not to mention final, draft.<p>I understand that these days some people work in a similar fashion, but with Post It notes.  The advantage being that you can spread them out over a table or wall or similar (walls are then a convenient source or otherwise unoccupied surface area), and they won't be as easily inadvertently jostled out of order.<p>If you are worried about losing a card organization scheme, when they are laid out in such fashion you can take picture(s) in order to preserve a record.  This can also serve as a backup mechanism against losing the cards.<p>It also works for handwritten notes.  You do <i>not</i> need to spend a lot of time on the pictures if that time is not productive.  But the pictures are so easy to take -- one can just snap them at the end of each day or workday.  If your 4 year old randomizes your stack, or you forget your notebook while juggling 3 other things, all is not lost.  If that never happens, all you've lost is a couple of minutes' clicking and some non-volatile memory capacity.<p>Behind all these comments, is the fact that for me, writing long hand is still sometimes most productive.  If the volume of output is less, the concentration tends to be higher.  And it can be accomplished most anywhere, at a moment's notice.",1226776960

It doesn't have feelings or emotions -- it has a big table of pay ranges for people with X years of experience and/or education.<p>Your strategy works if you name a ""negotiable"" number that is higher than what you really want to make, but near the employer's upper bound for the position.  Guess right, and you'll be negotiated down to a number that is mutually acceptable.  Guess too low, and you'll be under-paid.  Guess too high, and you'll be bounced without further negotiation.  No matter what you do, the onus is on <i>you</i> to guess correctly the numbers on the employer's sheet.  That's why saying the first number is bad when you're negotiating with a more knowledgeable opponent.<p>If you've had a lot of success with the ""anchoring"" method, it's likely because you're not coming close to the upper bound of the pay range that your employers had pre-determined for their positions.",1226776575

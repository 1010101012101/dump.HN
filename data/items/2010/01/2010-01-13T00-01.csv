They then explain that this doesn't work because it is proven that customers will buy the ethical option online if it is of equivalent value and price.<p>Being from a marketing background, I immediately pricked my ears at the complaint marketers have at hand wavy economists. Even if we ignore the fact that the value of a product is completely subjective & that it is influenced in many ways on some of which have anything to do with the physical product, getting customers to choose <i>your</i> product when it of ""equivalent price and value"" is the no. one thing a whole heap of companies do.

1048985,comment,1048304,1048304,0,0,cabalamat,,,"> <i>It is a logical impossibility to make a language more powerful by omitting features, no matter how bad they may be.</i><p>What does ""powerful"" mean, in programming lanugages? I can think of three meanings:<p>(1) what it can do. Once a language is Turing complete (call this 1.1), in one sense it can do anything. In another sense (1.2), maybe it can't: I wouldn't attept to write a Unix kernel in Java or a 3-D graphics library in Python because in both cases they are too high level of the task.<p>(2) how easy it is to program in? I.e. the number of programmer-hours it takes to solve a problem in that language.<p>(3) how easy it is to automatically reason about programs written in the language. This includes tools such as compilers, source code coverage tools, etc.<p>Now let's examine the original statement by these 4 criteria. We'll also consider the obverse, i.e. whether you can make a language less powerful by adding features.:<p>1.1 - if a language is already Turing-complete, removing features won't make it more so. Nor will adding features make it less powerful. But Turing-completeness is a trivial sense, as the article points out.<p>1.2 - adding eatures can make a language less powerful in this sense, because it can reduce the things it can do. For example, a big complex language with a large standard library might not work on a simple embedded controller, so in that sense it could do less. Or a language might require a certain model of multitasking that means it can't run on certain OS's (e.g. Java couldn't run on early versions of Windows (IIRC either 3.1 or 95 -- I don't remember the details). Or consider that Java is ""write-once run anywhere""; adding lots of low level features might imperil this.<p>2 -- adding features can certainly reduce power here too, e.g. if you have a large C++ program written by a team of programmers each of whom uses a different subset of the language.<p>3. -- again, adding features can reduce power. For example, in Fortran, an optimising compiler can make assumptions about the code that a C++ compiler can't make because C++  allows pointers to point to anything, e.g.:<p><pre><code>   int foo(int a, int* b){
      a = 1;
      *b = 2;
      bar(a); /* we don't know here if bar is being called
                 with parameter of 1 or 2 */ 
   }
</code></pre>
So I think the original proposition is false in practical terms.",1263341819

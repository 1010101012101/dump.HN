I use FFT only to gain a hint of where to look.  FFT itself, at least in the form that is built into the web audio api, is not accurate enough for a tuner.

7281170,comment,7279261,7279261,13,0,lstamour,,,"As it happens, Secure Transport (edit: on OS X) is open source. I just spent the last hour rummaging through source code ... It was later renamed to &quot;libsecurity_ssl&quot; when it landed on iOS. It&#x27;s been around since OS X launched. They also have a folder with about four dozen regression tests and a test app, not that I&#x27;ve had the chance to inspect either that closely. The tarballs are spread across two folders in the tarballs index: Security (look for multi-MB file sizes) and libsecurity_ssl. The 5-digit numbers appear to be sequential revision IDs, any single-digit numbers seem historical. (E.g. libsecurity_ssl-6 is before libsecurity_ssl-10 rather than after libsecurity_ssl-55471.)<p>It appears they haven&#x27;t posted newer source than this. The most recent timestamp I could find was Oct 11, 2013 in 55471, which corresponds to 7.0 and my 10.9 system has the same version number for Security.framework -- same bundle version of 55471 for 10.9.1 aka 13A581. Previous version numbers don&#x27;t appear to be as well-maintained. I don&#x27;t expect a newer release to be posted until the next OS X release, as the source was only published under 10.9, not iOS. Additionally, there&#x27;s no mention of iOS 7 on <a href=""http://www.opensource.apple.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensource.apple.com/</a><p>I couldn&#x27;t easily find the bug without more to go on, because the code is spread across a few components and really, I&#x27;m not an expert in TLS. It appears to have been largely unchanged from 2000-2006 or so. TLS 1.2 brought quite a few changes, but it was neat to browse through the lines of &quot;FIXME&quot; and &quot;TODO&quot; comments, as well as various diffs between releases. And neat to see how much code today still goes back to 1999-2001, sometimes all they did was add a &#x27;k&#x27; in front of a few variable names or delete the line in the first README saying the server code wasn&#x27;t tested against Windows ;-)<p>It sounds like when 10.9.2 is released, or at worst when 10.10 comes along, you&#x27;ll see a new push of code to the opensource site. We can all diff 55471 against what comes next to see the changes. (If someone&#x27;s already running 10.9.2 and its unaffected by the bug exhibited via curl, open /System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/Info.plist and post the Bundle version.)",1393050510

It is also that the developers who built orkut were very very bright new developers (many just out of college) who lacked experience. The brazilians took over orkut and the developers were unable to make tough decisions; like starting fresh. They also made the friendster mistake; their first implementation couldn&#x27;t scale and by the time the fixed it, it was too late. Furthermore, at the time, google had a policy of assigning managers to cover a very large number of developers and although the orkut manager was very sharp, he didn&#x27;t have more than a few hours a week to provide leadership. The final issue, was that orkut had a huge usage rate and no other service (gmail, picasa, etc) would accept an integration with orkut because it meant having to handle the huge additional load. Google needed Larry to step in and tell people they had to make it work. This is a classic example of a failure of one of Google&#x27;s core development philosophies: &quot;Developers don&#x27;t need management or experience; they can find the right solution using intelligence alone; you should never tell developers what to do.&quot; (full disclosure -- they kicked me out of the group so my opinion is biased; please take that into account).",1393050312

It can be hard to appreciate how much spoken language is a literate society is influenced by writing; much of that is due to the fact that we largely keep our memories outside of our skulls these days. Oral language, especially that which is meant to be passed along, is full of repetition, alliteration, rhyme and pun. If the script is something more like an abjad than an alphabet, the repetition may not necessarily <i>be</i> repetition. That may pose additional serious problems if the language (if it is a real language) is an effective isolate (having no documented surviving relatives). An abjad is hard enough to deal with when you have a Semitic-style non-concatenative morphology (words of related meanings have consonants in common, with the vowels changing), but if there is punning without semantically common roots, then all you know is that you have words close to each other that use the same consonants.",1393049013

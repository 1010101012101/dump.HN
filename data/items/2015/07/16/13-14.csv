9897191,comment,9896689,9896901,0,0,jerf,,,"In the end, a &quot;transpiler&quot; is just a compiler and subject to the same limitations. There is no generic set of limitations that apply to all compilers. Some are very good because they do something relatively easy, like Coffeescript -> JavaScript. I don&#x27;t mean that writing a great Coffeescript compiler [1] is necessarily &quot;easy&quot;, but the Coffeescript language was tightly designed to map directly to Javascript constructs, so there&#x27;s hardly any &quot;limitations&quot; at all; very nearly the entire target language is available to you, and to the extent that there may be JS you can&#x27;t generate, it&#x27;s probably JS the community generally agrees is a bad idea anyhow. Others, like gcc or LLVM, are actually bridging a fairly large gulf now between the source and target languages [2], but do a great job because of <i>massive piles of effort</i> by incredibly smart people.<p>But if you did have to make generalizations, the two big ones are that generally you can have a performance problem if you&#x27;re forced to compile something onto a target with a very different paradigm, and the target just doesn&#x27;t let you have a low-enough level view of things to implement the source language&#x27;s abstractions efficiently. For instance, consider the languages targeting the JVM <i>before</i> invokedynamic was added to the JVM... there was a fundamental paradigm mismatch that bled away a certain unavoidable amount of performance. The other problem you can get is that you may not get slick access to the low-level details of the target language; for instance, take a look at the piles of things that compile to JavaScript and compare how they allow you to use jQuery. It&#x27;s anything from &quot;What&#x27;s the problem?&quot; in CoffeeScript to being a full-on Foreign Function Interface-type call in GHCJS (even if you can get it pre-wrapped for you [3]), a Haskell->Javascript compiler. Both are really two aspects of the same &quot;impedance mismatch&quot; problem.<p>[1]: Look, I&#x27;ll be honest, I consider the term &quot;transpiler&quot; completely unnecessary. It&#x27;s a compiler. Feel free to just keep using transpiler in your reply and I won&#x27;t say anything again. I&#x27;ve had this argument, I bow to the trend, but this old fogey doesn&#x27;t intend to change (and still considers it a serious impediment to understanding to believe they are two different things, despite using the exact same techniques, architecture, tools, mental models... grumble grumble).<p>[2]: My recent previous comment goes into more detail on that claim: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9800231"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9800231</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs-jquery"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs-jquery</a>",1437055173

One thing is about my actions, and the other is about how my actions are supposed to be interpreted by the law.<p>The law is complex, and the interpretation of it is a skill we pay people a lot for.<p>For example. Let&#x27;s say I confess to killing someone, but I claim it was self defense. I &quot;totally did it&quot;, but the self-defense is a complication. Maybe my lawyer sucks, and maybe I killed this person in the wrong state and I&#x27;ll get a lethal injection. Maybe I can afford a great lawyer and I&#x27;ll get out of jail (although not for free...).<p>If the court decides that I acted in self defense, I didn&#x27;t break the law, right? Or would you say that I broke the law and got away with it? The way I see it, my actions may be clear, but the legality of them are in a kind of dual state which doesn&#x27;t collapse into a &quot;guilty&quot; or &quot;not guilty&quot; until there is an actual verdict.

I usually have 2 or 3 topics i.e. Ruby, Systems Thinking, Presenting, that I want to focus on.<p>For each of those focus topics I then:\n- Read a lot! I try and get a book done each week, maybe a second on the weekend. I have worked hard at improving my reading speed and if I really focus when I read (sit down at a desk, remove any distractions, get a nice coffee) I find I can get through material very quickly. While I am reading I take notes, I use these notes later on for writing (see later point)\n- Listen to podcasts/audiobooks, I like to put on an audio book and do a repetitive form of exercise or just walk around, I live in a city with lots of great places to walk so heading out for a 4 hour walk in the evening is easy and I can easily get through an audiobook, I take notes while I walk too.\n- Write about it, if I am learning about something I like to write about it too, this helps me cement the topic I am learning.\n- Do a course or workbook on the topic<p>Apart from the focus topic areas, I am subscribed to the Economist, Bloomberg Business week and various mailing lists, I like to scan through these articles and read any that catch my attention, I feel that having these taps on broader interest areas keeps me from getting too bored or narrow in my field of specialty (which is software).<p>I think the thing that helps me the most though is that I work as a consultant. I move industries (banking, retail, government, biochemical) and technology (c#, java, ruby, javascript) every few months so I am constantly finding myself in the deep end in new fields - this drives me to be on top things and is a good motivator to rapidly learn.<p>I have learned more in my 4 years as a consultant then I did in the 4 years at uni and 3 years working for other software shops.",1437053598

When I had finished my enthusiastic speech, one of the most seasoned instructors in the audience raised his hand and made his own short speech, which began by conceding that positive reinforcement might be good for the birds, but went on to deny that it was optimal for flight cadets. He said, “On many occasions I have praised flight cadets for clean execution of some aerobatic maneuver, and in general when they try it again, they do worse. On the other hand, I have often screamed at cadets for bad execution, and in general they do better the next time. So please don’t tell us that reinforcement works and punishment does not, because the opposite is the case.” This was a joyous moment, in which I understood an important truth about the world: because we tend to reward others when they do well and punish them when they do badly, and because there is regression to the mean, it is part of the human condition that we are statistically punished for rewarding others and rewarded for punishing them. I immediately arranged a demonstration in which each participant tossed two coins at a target behind his back, without any feedback. We measured the distances from the target and could see that those who had done best the first time had mostly deteriorated on their second try, and vice versa. But I knew that this demonstration would not undo the effects of lifelong exposure to a perverse contingency.<p>See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean</a>",1437052493

9896899,comment,9895698,9896638,0,0,globuous,,,"I thought general relativity actually proved that time was a fundamental dimension of our universe [1]. I&#x27;m really unsure because I have never studied general relativity, but I thought it used Reimanian geometry [2] to solve a bunch of things using 4D manifolds [3]. Is the reason you say that a consequence of relativity theory is that time isn&#x27;t exactly a property of the universe because the 4 variables of spacetime are all distances [(c*t, x, y, z)] as opposed to having 3 variables being distances and one time [(t, x, y, z)]? Or is it simply because Relativity proves that time isn&#x27;t universal etc ?<p>> That is, &quot;time&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist, but we created it.\nHonnestly, I very much like the Wikipedia introductory paragraph on time:\n&quot;Time is a measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them&quot; [4]\nI think time is just a measure used when describing dynamic systems (where past, present, and future make sense). Assume for a moment that the Big Bang happened at t = t_BB, and assume that for all t < t_BB, there was absolutely nothing in the universe and nothing was happening. Would time make sense in such a pre-Big Bang universe ? I think time is a fundamental property of a dynamic system because without it, the said system would not be dynamic. I&#x27;m not sure however that time is a fundamental property of the universe. Maybe of a dynamic universe ? In which case time would be a fundamental property of our current universe, in accordance with Einstein&#x27;s theory or relativity, but not in a pre-Big Bang universe such as the one mentioned just a few lines ago.<p>Finally, from the article:\n>  McTaggart argues that time is unreal because our descriptions of time are either contradictory, circular, or insufficient\nI think Einstein would probably agree with him in that time is at least contradictory [5]. Although I&#x27;m not sure they would mean that in the same way. To take McTaggart&#x27;s A-series argument:\n> Specifically, [McTaggart] argues that since every event that occurs will at one time be the future, at another time be the present, and at a third time (and forever henceforth) be past, every event exemplifies or instantiates every temporal property: futurity, presentness, and pastness. Since these properties are mutually exclusive (they cannot be co-instantiated), the A-series conception of time generates an absurdity, a contradiction. If both parts of his argument are sound, then time must just be an illusion; it has no genuine ontological status.\nI disagree with this logic. Notions of past, present, and future are mutually exclusive at any given time t; but events can of course go from future to present to past. It just can&#x27;t be more than one at the same time. Kinda like when you&#x27;re sprinting a 100m race, you can&#x27;t be before, on top, and after the finish line at the same instant. But you can go from one to the other without questioning the notion of distance. The analogy is far from perfect, but that&#x27;s how I see it. I may have misunderstood his argument though.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-manifold"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-manifold</a>\n[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time</a>\n[5] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafele%E2%80%93Keating_experiment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafele%E2%80%93Keating_experim...</a>",1437052036

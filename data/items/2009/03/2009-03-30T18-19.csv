So my first business failed, for a variety of reasons that included the fact that the product didn't fill any real need. If we'd done a bit of market research earlier on, we might have figured it out early enough to adjust.<p>Now, of course, if someone follows all the best bits of ""Getting Real"", they'll have a better chance of figuring out these kinds of problems ahead of time, even without a business plan. But Getting Real is not necessarily all that easy for everyone to follow.

I have many important KiokuDB applications in production.  And they are not toy Web 2.0 things, they are important sites that perform important data analyses.  I don't think any of the logic I had to write to support was particualarly difficult, and it was fewer lines of code than I would need to define my ORM classes.<p><i>The flexibility of the relational model is built on its bare simplicity: values + sets + logic.</i><p>Simplicity is good.  However, software is complex, and complexity has to live somewhere.  Look at git, for example.  The underlying model is simple and beautiful, blobs, trees, and commits.  Wonderful.  But, to make that beautiful model into a revision control system, thousands of lines of code had to be written.  So while simplicity makes the bottom part of the system simpler, it didn't do much for the overall simplicity of the entire system.<p>I feel the same way about object databases.  They are more complex than a relational database (unless you count things like replication and embedded scripting and ... as relational database features, which I don't), but they help me decrease the complexity of the code I see.<p>As an example, when I use an RDBMS, I have to maintain:<p>SQL schema + upgrades<p>ORM classes<p>Logic classes (for abstractions over multiple tables or data stores)<p>Random scripts to query the database and give me munged reports<p>With an object database, I only have to write the logic classes and the random scripts.   The random scripts are <i>slightly</i> more complicated, but not significantly more.  The main app is much simpler, and much easier to test.  I also don't have to hack my data model into the relational model.  (Ever represent a tree in a relational database?  It's a hack.)",1238438932

If you propose adding to this and giving up the benefits provided by these simplifications (simplicity of reasoning, ability to change the physical implementation without affecting the logical one [those not-magic indexes], declarative constraints, declarative queries), you need to have a really good reason.<p>The network model if it means anything is letting you add pointers to the mix and changing how you reason about your data from sets to graphs. This makes it harder to declare constraints, check integrity, update sets of data, access your data in different ways, and reason about your queries.

Oh come on, surely the British share some of the responsibility there, if not all of it. Last I checked, we haven't yet liberated* India, so if Indians consume American media (movies, books, music, etc) then they are actively importing it, by their own choice. And its not like you don't have alternatives in India, with its thriving native entertainment industry.<p>Some countries don't have native content-producing industries, and so you could say that the importing of foreign culture squashes these industries before they can develop. On the other hand, keeping it out is basically censorship.<p>(* This ironic use of the work ""liberate"" is a sick joke that I'm not proud of, but it does sum up the cynicism most brain-holding Americans feel about their government's foreign policy.)",1238436639

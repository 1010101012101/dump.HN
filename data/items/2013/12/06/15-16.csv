You&#x27;re thinking of TestingBot as the customer, so you see one customer replacing AWS with dedicated servers and calling it a cloud.  That&#x27;s not the actual scenario, though.  TestingBot built a cloud for <i>their</i> customers.  They built a way for their customers to offload the risk and costs of scaling their test infrastructures.  They built a simple[1], automated way for their customers to easily scale.  They built a way to share the same hardware among many customers and thus lower costs and improve utilization.  This is a cloud.<p>I also don&#x27;t really agree with your claim that the key attribute of &quot;the cloud&quot; is offloading the risk and cost of scaling.  From my perspective, &quot;the cloud&quot; is primarily about simplifying and automating scaling, thus reducing the human and time costs.  It&#x27;s not just about dumping the cost of physical machines onto someone else.  I see taking less risk on machine purchases as a nice benefit, but not the core purpose.<p>[1] I haven&#x27;t actually used TestingBot, so this isn&#x27;t an endorsement.  I have no idea if they actually do a good job or not.",1386345599

Plus they introduce some platform/API changes intermittently that make their admin UIs kinda buggy. Or you have to change your workflow to integrate with their services (though the APIs for this are usually ok).

This is exactly why it&#x27;s popular in China. It is a currency whose supply is algorithmically limited and theoretically should track global inflation. The world has always had nominal exchange rates and de-facto exchange rates for restricted currencies; but until something like Bitcoin emerged there was no legal way to perform exchanges at the de-facto rates at scale.<p>My big worry with Bitcoin is that the supply is too limited. Currency is subject to manipulation by many forces; much of the job of a central bank in control of money supply is to counteract any intentional manipulation. With unstable prices and a limited circulation value (the total value of all BTC in circulation is only ~$12 billion) it is very open to manipulation by investment banks and hedge funds. Until BTC reaches economic scale, it&#x27;s going to be subject to all sorts of shenanigans; and with no central authority to counteract the manipulative influences, I don&#x27;t know that there will ever be enough trust in it for it to reach that scale.",1386345339

This extended period of glaciations and interglacials together is called the quarternary ice age, also known as the current ice age.<p>Ice ages are the periods in earth&#x27;s geological history when permanent ice caps and glaciers existed at the poles and in mountain ranges. We think of that situation as normal, but it has only existed for the last 2 to 2.5 million years. The high albedo (reflection of sunlight) of the ice sheets at the poles cools the planet down further, so an ice age reinforces itself. In other words, we are now living in a warmer period inside an ice age.<p>There have been other ice ages before, but the last one before the current ended about 100 million years before the first dinosaurs evolved.",1386345103

Searching specific column rather than entire table.</i><p>See the &quot;Year&quot; and &quot;Max Price&quot; examples at the bottom of the &quot;Querying&quot; sub-section under &quot;Operations&quot;, right before &quot;Pagination&quot;. You would do that by adding your own query function:<p><pre><code>    $(&#x27;#my-table&#x27;)\n      .bind(&#x27;dynatable:init&#x27;, function(e, dynatable) {\n        dynatable.queries.functions[&#x27;myQueryName&#x27;] = function(record, queryValue) {\n          return record.myAttribute != queryValue;\n        };\n      })\n      .dynatable();\n</code></pre>\nThen, you&#x27;d invoke the query like this:<p><pre><code>    dynatable.queries.add(&#x27;myQueryName&#x27;, &#x27;hello&#x27;);\n    dynatable.process();\n</code></pre>\nAnd that will execute your query function which finds all records for which `myAttribute` is not equal to &quot;hello&quot;. Of course, you&#x27;d need to bind the above query execution to some user input, like the `change` event of a text field or something like that, and instead of &#x27;hello&#x27;, you could pass in the value of the input.<p>This is a common scenario, so dynatable provides a shortcut to this style of invocation of your custom query functions by passing dom elements to the `inputs` config option. So, you could replace both of the above with this:<p><pre><code>    var dynatable = $(&#x27;#my-table&#x27;)\n      .bind(&#x27;dynatable:init&#x27;, function(e, dynatable) {\n        dynatable.queries.functions[&#x27;myQueryName&#x27;] = function(record, queryValue) {\n          return record.myAttribute != queryValue;\n        };\n      })\n      .dynatable({\n        inputs: {\n          queries: $(&#x27;#my-input&#x27;)\n        }\n      });\n</code></pre>\nThis will now cause the `myQueryName` function to be run on the dataset with the value of the `#my-input` dom element and process the results on the `blur` or `change` events of that dom element (the events that trigger the query processing can be changed via the `inputs.queryEvent` config option).<p>I think this answers both of your questions. If there&#x27;s a different sort of syntax you had in mind for providing an easier or more straight forward way of doing this, please let me know!",1386344683

In the sense of giving money over to someone else for the achievement of a goal, I would see 3 basic categories:<p>1) A donation, however phrased.  In this sense, you are effectively giving money away with no expectations of any future returns of any sort.  It would be for the most part &quot;anonymous&quot;, or at the very least trackable only for the purpose of eventually allowing the recipient to say &quot;thanks&quot;.<p>2) A pre-paid product purchase.  In this case you&#x27;re effectively combining the elements of the &quot;group buy&quot; concept that at least at one time was semi-popular on Internet forums (8 years ago a group of F-150 enthusiasts all got together to purchase Gaylord brand fiberglass bed covers.  Standard price was $1600, IIRC, but by committing to purchase 25 units all at once, we were able to purchase them for $1200 shipped).  In this case you realize that the product delivery will occur at some future date, and that you get your money back/don&#x27;t have to pay if the goal is not reached.  If this goal <i>IS</i> reached, you fully expect to receive the advertised product within a reasonable timeframe.<p>3) An investment.  In this case you are not looking for a product, per se, but you believe the corporation has the potential to make money.  Your investment buys you a share of the company, and therefore a share of future value as well.  Investments carry risk, and your investment could also become worthless, or worth less than the investment amount.<p>Kickstarter seems to mostly attract people looking for #2 above, and most projects have some very low tier to accommodate people who only want #1 above.  I&#x27;m not saying the project owner <i>can&#x27;t</i> or <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> turn a profit, I was just saying that the project backers don&#x27;t ever receive any part of that profit, so they are not &quot;investors&quot; (a term which Kickstarter seems to purposefully avoid&quot;.",1386344630

Companies seem to have gotten to comfortable with the fact that they can easily release updates post-release, and it&#x27;s gotten to the point where they are releasing unfinished software to customers who expect it to be a finished.<p>Major problems with Windows 8 that should never have made it past QA/UAT:<p>1.

The main thesis is that Mac OS did change only incrementally, while Windows leaps chaotically between new features and philosophies. That&#x27;s not true, and in fact the illustrations used contradict the conclusions drawn in the article.<p>For example, when they talk about the introduction of the proto Dock in Mac OS, they say &quot;no major changes in UI&quot;. But when Windows introduces the Start menu and task bar that&#x27;s changing the UI &quot;completely&quot;. Then come the incremental UI refinements and color changes that coincide with new graphics capabilities, again this is heralded as being more of the same for Mac but radically different with each version of Windows. Looking at these screenshots <i>which show similar trends in UI development</i> side by side and coming to wildly different conclusions in the face of those similarities is just a stunning display of cognitive dissonance.<p>The change to Metro would be the only big jump where the article is actually right in asserting a real change, if we&#x27;d be willing to forget the fact that Metro (or whatever it&#x27;s called now) is nothing but a thin veneer you have to get past in order to access the real Windows, which is of course pretty much a clone of its predecessor.<p>All this just to explain a conclusion from an anecdote, a conclusion which the article itself proves wrong unwittingly. Even if we accept that OS X users don&#x27;t buy books about their OS and don&#x27;t rant as much (which I find particularly out of touch with reality), that&#x27;s because there are vastly more Windows users around. Because the numbers are so great, there are also a lot of Windows users who lack the tech intuition but want to learn, so they buy a book about it. OS X clientele is just by and large different.

We developers, geeks, tinkerers, etc. know what an OS is. But to the end user, it&#x27;s what they see on the screen. It&#x27;s what they interact with. That is the abstraction we attempt for the vast majority of users. There is no need for most people know know how something is implemented. They just use it. The same applies for just about every other thing in existence. We use things. We consume things. We don&#x27;t need to know how they are built to use them. Sure, some of us care, but most don&#x27;t. Just talk to non-nerdy types and find out how ignorant (and I don&#x27;t mean that in a pejorative way) they are when it comes to technology.

They don&#x27;t want lung cancer and they don&#x27;t want their kids breathing this crap.<p>That being said, the government is taking steps to address the issue. Specifically, due to an outcry on Weibo last year about having to get PM2.5 numbers from the US embassy&#x27;s twitter feed and iPhone app (twitter is blocked, but screenshots of the iPhone app were pasted on weibo), the government here has started reporting pollution numbers in major cities around the country. So there&#x27;s reporting now.<p>Second, they&#x27;ve forced the state-owned oil companies to retool to start outputting cleaner gasoline, moved big polluting industry out of the cities (steel plants, etc.), closed down barbecue pits, ended the sale of some of the more polluting coal briquettes that used to be common, and are trying to get construction sites to keep the dust down.<p>All of those steps are helping, but not reversing the trend (so far as I can tell or have heard). There is a push to move from coal-burning power plants to gas-powered power plants, but they need to find the gas (via fracking or other means).<p>Is there an outcry? There are certainly people posting about the pollution on Weibo, which is China&#x27;s twitter. There are also plenty of people emigrating to the US, if they can afford it (voting with their feet, even if they can&#x27;t vote here). But I think for people to do more than that, they&#x27;d need to see the government just not giving a damn.

MS has excellent tooling and support, but nobody knows about it. They have Bizspark, which is one of the best startup-focused programs I&#x27;ve seen (literally tons of free stuff for your runway), but once again nobody knows about it. Azure is probably the most innovative, stable, clearly-priced cloud platform in the industry, but nobody knows about it. If you want to write Javascript/Node with full IDE support, Microsoft has you covered, but nobody knows about it. F# is probably the best FP language in existence, but nobody... well, the point is made.<p>The only people that know about the new things MS comes out with are the few of us .NET developers also with a foothold in the Startup scene, and old enterprise companies who bought into the stack back in VB5/C++/MVC days.<p>The other uphill battle is young people&#x27;s view on technology. Most of them would rather platform-hop in the same way people change churches (and for much the same reasons). New = better, and Microsoft = old, so no need to even see what they have to offer. Young people with ample free time have always driven the software industry, and young people want to use things built by startuppy or nonsensical names. &quot;Microsoft? They actually have software in the name? No thanks!&quot;<p>Finally, it&#x27;s an issue of evangelism and online/community presence. Because enterprise is the bread and butter of MS, MS tends to target those kind of people more. It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t try to capture new minds, but when you attend an event where you&#x27;re the lone startup guy among 50 enterprise people, how do you think presentations are going to be focused? When your community seems to be centralized on your corporate domain, are you really going to attract someone who isn&#x27;t willing to type in &quot;microsoft&quot;? New platforms get popular not because they&#x27;re actually better, but because they&#x27;re cooler. Either cooler sounding, there&#x27;s a new type of tutorial (to-dos and 5-minute-blogs are played out, people), or it&#x27;s got a guy with weird hair promoting it, using Jobs-esque language like &quot;beautiful&quot; or &quot;elegant&quot;. Of course it&#x27;s elegant at version 0.9 before it really does anything. Look at Rails now that it actually does stuff.<p>Anyway, mini-rant over. I think MS deserves more attention than they get, but ultimately they dig their own grave by not investing more in capturing that next generation.",1386343109

Had these (alledged) scammers been more modest (40k goal, earlier deadline) they would have gotten away with it.\nBesides, Kickstarter has had several cases of fraud and scam recently, so it looks like their Trust&Safety procedure has not fully matured yet (which is normal since they&#x27;ve recently grown big enough that this is enough of a concern to create a dedicated department). This is a concern big crowdsourcing platforms are starting to face, and for working in the fraud detection space and often discussing these matters with other tech companies I can say it&#x27;s still something fairly new to them.<p>4/ All this discussion is completely besides the original point I was trying to make. Whether this particular instance is going to go through or not, my point was that there is something interesting about scammers in that they seem to (consciously or not) have their own culture and implicit codes, one of which being this very specific type of communication that seems egregious to most of us but could drive better conversion among their target population. I thought this was an interesting/amusing thought, but you&#x27;re free to disagree.",1386342682

We achieves great performance for our use-case by correct schema-design / partitioning of data, and sane use of indexes - which are excellent in MongoDB. If you need to scale large, you need to store the data in such a way that it does not require much resources to fetch them, i.e. you must store the data according to your read-requirements.

What you have to look at is the entire culture, the entire family and community and so on. Perls proposed that in all relationships people could be either toxic or nourishing towards one another. It is not necessarily true that the same person will be toxic or nourishing in every relationship, but the combination of any two people in a relationship produces toxic or nourishing consequences. And the important thing that I can tell you is that there is a test to determine whether someone is toxic or nourishing in your relationship with them. Here is the test: You have spent some time with this person, either you have a drink or go for dinner or you go to a ball game. It doesn&#x27;t matter very much but at the end of that time you observe whether you are more energized or less energized. Whether you are tired or whether you are exhilarated. If you are more tired then you have been poisoned. If you have more energy you have been nourished. The test is almost infallible and I suggest that you use it for the rest of your life.",1386342014

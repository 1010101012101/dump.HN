The little blobs your OS has to upload into memory of your WiFi card, Bluetooth controller, sensors, camera... and that&#x27;s all it has to do with it. The rest happens on completely different CPUs - the ones that live inside your WiFi card, Bluetooth controller, sensors, camera...<p>Even if your hardware seemingly doesn&#x27;t require the blob to be loaded, it&#x27;s most likely because it simply has a on board memory to store it.

Even microSD cards.<p>From OS point of view, the only sensible approach to differentiate between free and non-free firmwares is to ask a question &quot;is it freely redistributable?&quot;.

Then you only reach the small niche really interested in freedom and openness and pretty much nobody else. The costs and prices skyrocket, because you cannot rely on economy of scale.<p>- device that you want to provide competitive hardware to what&#x27;s already on the market, but free. In most of the fields, you will have a hard time to catch up to competitors, as you most likely won&#x27;t be able to get any funding in the way they did. You&#x27;ll have to resort to crowdfunding and probably fail anyway, as a very small fraction of projects like that manages to do anything at all - and they&#x27;re usually the smaller and easier ones anyway.<p>Also, closed firmware blobs don&#x27;t pose any threats - any additional ones that you already have even when not using them, that is. If you have a device that doesn&#x27;t need a firmware to be loaded in order to run, then most likely it already has a non-free firmware integrated on board. For instance: HDD, SSD, SD cards, some cameras, most of controllers like USB or RAID... virtually anything.<p>By calling people like Theo de Raadt conspirators, you only hurt the cause you think you are fighting for. You won&#x27;t change the world by that. You can only change it with small steps, by supporting niche projects like Neo900, even if they had to go for some compromises. What differentiates them from others is that their compromise lies far further than what&#x27;s common in mainstream devices, and only if this iteration succeeds, a new one could in the future, moving that compromise even further towards the ideal state.<p>Having been involved in Openmoko and related communities for quite a long time exactly for the reasons of hardware freedoms and openness, I really don&#x27;t see any other way.",1433618726

A similar system was used on an app that would try to find connection strength between people using sent emails as signal. At it&#x27;s peak the node table had tens of millions of rows, with some of the nodes (users) having thousands of edges each. The main pitfalls are<p>* loading too many edges (10K+) and associated nodes will be slow.
* Traversing nodes in a meaningful way can be difficult.<p>To solve these, the schema has the following indices:<p>On edge table: (`from_node_id`,`type`,`updated`)
On node_data table: (`type`,`data`(128))<p>Since edges rarely change, the first index allows you to paginate over edges by using updated as the order. As long as you request a reasonable number of edges, things should work OK. The second index is needed to get a node given some data, but a secondary use is sorting. By precomputing some score and saving it in node_data you can traverse nodes in that order (this is not currently built but is simple to do in SQL).<p>All this being said, the schema is pretty index heavy so if MySQL is forced to kick some of those out of memory it may lead to a bad time.<p>Thanks for the kind words on the model, I never thought about it being separate, but it makes 100% sense.",1433617237

There is a difference between Option[T] and (T | Nil) that&#x27;s worth mentioning, however.<p>Option[T]&#x27;s are composable. For example, let&#x27;s say we have a &quot;get&quot; method to get the value for a given key, whose type looks like:<p><pre><code>    get :: String -> (T | Nil)

If we were using Option[T]&#x27;s, it would look like:<p><pre><code>    get :: String -> Option[T]
</code></pre>
So let&#x27;s say we have a map, and want to lookup a key (syntax is made-up):<p><pre><code>    let m: Map[String,(Int | Nil)] = make_some_map()
    let result: (Int | Nil) = m.get(&quot;some-key&quot;)
</code></pre>
If result is nil, was the value of the key nil, or was the key not in the map?<p>With Option[T]:<p><pre><code>    let m: Map[String,Option[Int]] = make_some_map()
    let result: Option[Option[Int]] = m.get(&quot;some-key&quot;)

Here result will either be None, in which case the key wasn&#x27;t in the map, or Some(None), which means the value of the key was None.<p>So there is an observable and potentially useful difference between (T | Nil) and Option[T].",1433617218

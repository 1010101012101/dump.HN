While the typical brogrammer is absolutely capable of making lewd remarks, it's unlikely he will engage in aggressive acts, because he is already very successful with women - why would he want to jeopardize that.<p>Like you, I would also consider myself a reclusive geek, and probably like you I wouldn't even consider that kind of behavior, not only because it's wrong and frowned-upon, but because the thought of doing this would never occur to me. Most geeks I know fall somewhere in this spectrum between ""ladies man"" and ""recluse"", but I can see none of them exhibiting the kind of behavior we're talking about.<p>Hence I believe there must be a third group of people who are, for lack of a better term, insane beneath their fake exterior.",1369054798

I'm not certain what it is, but here's my attempt to explain.<p>You say that the inspiration comes from other sponsored bloggers, but there's a difference between what you are asking and what they are asking. John Gruber and Marco Arment have both created useful products. They proved that if they have the freedom to manage their own time, then they will build things that other people want to use. I flipped through many of your blog posts and Tweets trying to get a feel for the type of work you do. I couldn't find anything of value.<p>All I found were number of pop culture references and one paragraph summaries of tiny projects that you gave up on when the time came to implement. For example, Maelstrom was something that was related to Twitter streams. If I'm reading the dates correctly, you appear to have started work on the 18th and then quit the following day, stating burnout after a few hours of programming. Now its the 20th, and you are here asking for money. That is not the type of work ethic that gives me any confidence in your ability to produce valuable content in the future.<p>@Prawn compared this to the million dollar homepage. However, I think there's a big disconnect between the two. That homepage was always explained as an advertising experiment. You are asking for money in the hopes that a few hundred dollars will be the missing key to producing anything of value.<p>It feels smarmy to me (someone who works a 9-5 and still manages to slowly grow his own company in his free time) to see someone who built nothing of value ask for a hand out. Its actually worse than building nothing. There is evidence that you cannot focus on a project for more than a weekend.<p>In all honesty, if your Twitter account hadn't been created back in September, I would assume this is another elaborate test to see how social networks can be gamed.<p>If that all came across as overtly negative, then good. I think that we could all use more positive comments when they are warranted, but I cannot find anything about this that isn't slimy.<p>To be fair, if anyone cares to dig through my own history, it's easy to find that I actually did the same thing at one point in my life. The difference is that I was 15 at the time.",1369053049

Clearly, the darker problem is that there are evidently a lot of men out there who like to engage in that kind of behavior. Showing them that this is not OK only covers part of the issue, the scarier part is that apparently considering women to be less-than-human is a prevalent and deep-running attitude.<p>As an aside, the term <i>brogrammer</i> is probably misapplied here.

When tens of filesystems with sophisticated features completely omit what is one of the most common features used by database users, presumably it's not because filesystem designers are not capable of implementing it but of some more mundane reason.<p>> Not for stuff that's in the DB's page cache.<p>The database has to log what was written. It does use syscalls to write the write-ahead log. Agreed it can save read syscalls. Then again one process sending a query to another process to read something generates even more syscalls than having everything (app+db) all in the same process.<p>You are right about 2. I'm playing devils advocate here jumping around assumptions. I could ask why you assume an OS will use a page per file, you can say Linux does this, I can say why is your OS so heavy and point to Exokernel, you can say that's side-stepping the issue. I could say user-space filesystem having its own page cache; in the end we are talking about the same thing. In the end: the less layers the better.<p>When I look at the kernel I see something like the Berlin wall. A barrier that was there since you were born and which you never asked for.

5737173,comment,5736397,5736889,12,0,cpleppert,,,"jQuery has a considerable performance cost for the abstractions it provides. It doesn't just call the native methods under the hood, it has to provide additional abstractions like chaining by wrapping every returned object into a jQuery object. In a lot of cases these abstractions aren't helpful because you need to understand exactly what jQuery is doing. If you compare the cost of native methods over what jQuery does you easily add 500 lines of javascript code on every method call.<p>Additionally, jQuery may not provide the abstractions you need or want. If you are using a high level framework that manages templating I would argue that you should use the abstractions designed by the framework and not the one-size-fits all ones that jQuery provides. There is a lot of functionality that jQuery provides that may not be relevant at all for you. jQuery animations are one example.<p>Using jQuery doesn't stop you from running into browser bugs. jQuery could help you out with basic things like selection and event handling but modern browsers are already much improved in this area.<p>I very much dislike the spaghetti code that over reliance on jQuery plugins results in.

I'm not above some criticism for Ouya[1], but let's at least keep it in realistic realms and in ways that can be used to improve the product. By the end of this, not only was I not convinced it was a failing of Ouya, even if I were, there was no indication of what Ouya could do better to fix it.<p>They assumed you'd use the controller to move a pointer around on the screen, instead of highlighting different buttons. Have they not played console games? I can think of only a handful of console games that have a free-form pointer, and it's only for the gameplay (the point-and-click adventure game and the ill-informed PC strategy game to console port): the menus outside of gameplay are still direction-driven.<p>Direction-driven, focus-based menus are very easy to build. You could go the very easy way with a state machine, or you could even hack your way through it with a bunch of counters and switch statements. To me, it actually fits easier into the framerate conscious style of programming for games much, much easier than a point-and-click interface, as you don't have to do any hit checking. Not that hit checking itself is very hard, either.<p>Regardless, the menu system should be abstracted enough from the game code that it wouldn't be an issue to rip it out completely and build a new one from scratch. My impression is that this is the real issue. It's not that direction-based menus are difficult to make, it's that it's difficult to make any sort of changes to the type of spaghetti code that game developers and mobile developers and small startup developers (God help us when they come in the same package) write when they naively assume they ""don't have time"" to write good code. This isn't limited to these fields, but these particular types of people tend to be the least matured into their programming.<p>But yeah, be the workman who blames his tools. It's Ouya's fault that you can't write the bare simplest menu style in the field of gaming.<p>[1] The wifi might be slow (I don't know if I have an interference problem yet) and some of the controller buttons get snagged on the inside edge of the faceplate if I press them too hard. The wifi might not be their fault and I can fix the faceplate on my own. Brand new hardware from a brand new company is going to have some rough edges (literally, in this case).",1369051899

5737148,comment,5732949,5732949,1,0,tegeek,,,"IMO currying is a bit advance idea for non-functional programmers. \nIf I were to explain functional programming in 5 min, I would start from Functions and Values.<p>In FP, there is no difference between a Function and a Value. A function can be defined without a name. You can say every thing is a function & a function takes an input and after performing its magic (calculations), it must return you an output. All values are also functions. So technically there is no difference between x = 2 and x = function(){....}.<p>Now when you realize that all values are also functions or all functions are also values, you can pass functions inside other functions.\nTypically in imperative programming your functions only accepts values (like integers, strings etc.) and returns you values. But in FP you can pass functions inside other functions and you can return functions from functions.<p>Lets define a function doSomething(input){ return input } . Now you can call it by passing x where x could be a value or a function.<p>y = doSomething(x)<p>Now if x = function(){ ..} or x = 2, it really doesn't matter for doSomething because doSomething crunches an input and returns it.<p>By learning this technique, you can do lot of ""interesting things"". And Currying is one of those ""interesting things"". Every thing in FP really boils down to functions/values. 5 mins are over now.",1369051513

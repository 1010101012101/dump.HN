Also, to be honest, I wouldn't call Digg a news website, I see very few newsworthy stories on Digg... it's more like a collection of cool links.",1181148591

Squares with the other article on news.YC (forgot the title...) about how a typical VC expects the founders to own 3-10% of the company at a liquidity event.<p>One thing I don't understand: why does <i>any</i> software startup take VC?  10% of $200M = 100% of $20M, but you're much more likely to find a buyer for the $20M two-guys-in-a-garage startup than the $200M startup with 2 dozen employees.  It seems like VC doesn't increase your best-case outcome at all, but significantly decreases the chance that you'll reach your best-case outcome.",1181145998

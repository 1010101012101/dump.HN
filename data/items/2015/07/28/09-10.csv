Besides lacking the obvious biological constraints, digital AIs are not necessarily limited to pure neural networks. AIs can be made up of hybrid systems in which neural networks have access to web-scale knowledge bases, extremely fast and prcecise databases for writing and reading arbitrary data and storing them indefinitly, APIs for running computations that would be difficult to implement in neural networks, and so on. The neural network part of the AI could evolve and learn with having zero-latency, high-bandwith access to several such resources and learn how to make optimal use of them.",1438077500

9960338,comment,9959217,9959217,0,0,malandrew,,,"So I noticed that maternity leave is cited often, but that strikes me as a lesser problem in tech relative to the cost of housing. Raising a family in San Francisco is not a cheap proposition. Rent keeps rising in the Bay Area.<p>Let&#x27;s do a thought experiment.<p>Lets say a man and a women in tech both moved here 5 years ago and each got small rent-controlled studio apartments for about $1000/month. Let&#x27;s say they met and started dating two years ago. They decide they want to move in together. They can forego one dwelling and share a studio apartment, or they can look on the market. They look around for a one-bedroom. Two years ago, a one bedroom is probably going for $2500 a month. Fast forward to today and they decide to have a kid. Everything is great for the first 1-2 years, but by 2017, they feel like they need a 2-bedroom. They start looking around and see that the only options cost about $5000 to $6000 month. That&#x27;s a huge cost of living increase before the cost of child-rearing and is far more likely to drive people (men and women) out of the industry than unfavorable maternity leave policies.<p>In the thought experiment above, both a man and a woman both leave tech in SF together once they are forced out of the area by the conflict between housing prices and raising a family. The different is that the age distribution for men is likely to much broader than for women because of the biological clock. A man marrying and having a kid could likely be anywhere from 27 or so to past 40, where the range for women is likely to have approximately the same lower bound, but a much lower higher bound. I suspect 33 or so. This would suggest that housing prices are more likely to prematurely end the careers of women in tech in San Francisco.",1438074600

Engineers may also work on writing up feature specs so that the technical requirements are met before a feature is started.<p>This contributor will be a strong programmer with a leaning toward full-stack development. Substantial front ends skills are highly desired since most features have some user interface component. A strong working knowledge of Rails, and OOP will be especially useful, as Teespring has a large codebase and effectively architecting our code will enable us to continue to iterate quickly. Experience writing scalable code and queries will come in very handy!<p>We want people with the ability to bring new ideas to help drive innovation. We pride ourselves on IDEAS philosophy: Innovative, Deliver, Empower, Authentic, Scrappy.<p>If you are successful in this role, a year from now you will:\nMentor other engineers, both in your team and across the company, toward technical excellence\nBe an established Pod Technical Lead increasing our engineering efficiency\nHave significant architectural ownership \nBe a known thought leader on what it means to write craftsman level code<p>Our Environment:\nModern Ruby + Rails Stack, TDD/BDD with RSpec/Cucumber, Redis, MySQL, Backbone.JS, React.JS, GO<p>What do we need?\nSenior level software engineer ready to build highly visible apps - ideally in Ruby\nEngineer who can mentor his/her teammates and wants to give back - tech talks, lightning talks, etc.\nWide knowledge of web apps - scalability, growth, mentorship\nExperience implementing Service Oriented Architecture or micro-services\nGood intuition for weighing trade-offs\nOpen Source contributors are preferred<p>What do we offer? \nHappiness is just as important to us as hard work. All startups in San Francisco offer the same perks, but what makes us different is our desire to completely change how the world thinks about apparel and custom e-commerce. That being said, here are the benefits you will receive:\nWorking with talented, collaborative, and entrepreneurial teams\nMedical, dental and vision insurance for you, your family, or pet \nUnlimited paid time off and 9 paid holidays \nGenerous stock options\nFree catered lunch and dinner daily\nFully stocked kitchen with drinks, snacks, and bar\nTraining, career development, and meet up hosting \nFun SOMA office with easy access to Muni, Bart, and Caltrain with commuter benefits\nApple computers and Thunderbolt monitors \nSocial activities, office happy hours, concerts, game room, and endless free t-shirts!<p>Please email your resume to ashley.hearn@teespring.com to learn more",1438074419

9960306,comment,9954936,9954936,0,0,AndreasGalster,,,"As mentioned, if you just go for the Material Design look, there&#x27;s several options, Materialize, MaterialUI & the elements that are on the Polymer site (Please note, they are not part of Polymer, a distinction with which Google is having problems. They want you to see them as two seperate things). Materialize doesn&#x27;t come nearly as close to the &quot;fun&quot; experience as Polymer/React, though it&#x27;s easier to get started I guess.<p>Now, I cannot speak much about the differences between React and Polymer, I&#x27;ve never used React but as mentioned already, React has better browser support. React works great in all browsers right now, whereas with Polymer it is complicated. I&#x27;m saying complicated because the general impression is that Polymer after being 1.0 is not production ready or good yet. This is not true. It is production ready if you only use Polymer. However, it still has issues working together with other DOM manipulating frameworks such as Meteor, Angular, etc. ... This is due to the fact that Polymer heavily relies on polyfilling the shadow DOM specs that are currently only implemented in Chrome & Opera.<p>Their shadow DOM polyfill worked pretty good, but performance was horrible especially in Safari. Which is why with 1.0 they rewrote the polyfill from scratch, now called shady DOM. It emulates shadow DOM in a less strict way, which results in other frameworks not working properly with Polymer as of now. So, look out for a patch that&#x27;s currently in the works for this issue.<p>Aside from that, Polymer works really well in my opinion. I think what&#x27;s imporant to understand though is that React and Polymer fulfill different purposes. Polymer is a very bold undertaking of trying to bring web components right now to your browser. React has a similar approach afaik in the sense that you can easily create reusable components but it&#x27;s just a different technological approach based on what&#x27;s possible right now. That&#x27;s also why React performs better because they don&#x27;t try to polyfill stuff. If you look at the webcomponents and webcomponents-lite polyfills you might think &quot;holy shit&quot;. That&#x27;s some serious effort they put into that. So much polyfilling will hurt performance obviously.<p>React is eventually going to use webcomponents, just like Polymer. So what will be the difference of React and Polymer in the future? Hard to say. I&#x27;m guessing they will be very similar, in fact who knows maybe React will use Polymer, not for the polyfills (which technically isn&#x27;t a part of the Polymer project ... anymore[?]) but rather for the webcomponents sugar coating on top that makes writing web components easier and more fun.<p>Now, your question was what should you use for Material design. If you just use Polymer go for it right now (some browsers will be a bit slower, namely Safari but whatever. Progressive enhancement FTW. It&#x27;ll get better, they&#x27;re working on implementations). If you need to couple it with another framework, carefully do some first tests. If you know you only ship in a few months from now then it&#x27;s probably safe to go with it, since a patch will certainly be out by then.<p>If you want great performance and browser support right now, go for React.<p>If you don&#x27;t care about supporting ancient browsers and want to support only evergreen browsers then choose whatever you like better.<p>As for me, I&#x27;m about to launch my startup&#x27;s site with Polymer soon, hacking some of the issues that are still there when integrating it with meteor.",1438074006

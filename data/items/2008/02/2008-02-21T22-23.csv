In the end, he just runs a site where people can send messages to each other.<p>10 years from now, facebook will be forgotten and social networks will seem even lamer than they do now. They are easy to build, and really they come down to this:
<i>messaging platform (like email except not as well developed)
</i>shared address book that allows you to navigate through to other people's address book (friend list)
*basic personal website where you can easily put pictures and text up and have comments.<p>They consider themselves a platform for apps, but the apps are pretty lame, and just waste time.",1203634363

Applications for me are less about how annoying some of them can be, and how poorly they're implemented.<p>Those that require you to send invites to friends before you can make use of it, or simply requiring you to add the application just to see how someone has ranked you compared to the rest of your friends should get a slap on the wrist.  It kills usability, and it hurts.  I'll never use these apps, I'm just curious to see what my friend is trying to tell me.<p>Then again, at the same time you have applications that say you have a message waiting for you, when it's really nothing more than an invitation from someone else.  Borderline Spam Marketing from your friends.  And when your friends Spam you, what asylum is left?",1203634263

Hopefully you're not just renaming roles already defined by the DBMS?<p>It sounds like you might not be dealing with non-technical business
users here; if you can explain your users a bit better, you can
probably get more help.<p>Otherwise...<p>If you can get spaces into the names, all to the good. Could just be
too restrictive to use one-word role names. Longer names might look
like: [database manager, table designer, table manager, writer,
reader, banned]<p>Or use verbs: [administer, manage, design, write, read, do nothing.] This
allow you to write friendly messages; ""You may #{ role-verb } pages on
this site.""<p>If the database holds, say, web sites and pages, try to find actual
career names; [database administrator, site manager, web designer,
writer, customer, banned]<p>Hope that's some ideas.",1203634093

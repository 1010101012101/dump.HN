3652,comment,3629,3629,0,0,danielha,,,"Unless a company will only have one employee forever, there is no knowledge ""specialized"" enough. If you are exceptionally skilled in something, you can find someone who possess what you are lacking. Especially in an investor's point of view, it might seem dangerous to have a single founder running the show. You need someone to back you at times, and disagree and say you're doing it wrong at other times.<p>Instead of finding exceptions, why not have the statistics work in your favor?",1173651831

3649,comment,3531,3626,0,0,arasakik,,,"So essentially what you're saying is that any assets that the company makes cannot be transferred to me until I am an American citizen? I wonder what the consequences would be if I am an H1-B holder and revenues from moonlighting grew to a point where I could quit my day job. <p>Since I am a Canadian, I also wonder if it would be easier to just incorporate in Canada instead - this does not seem optimal either, as Canadian taxes are incredibly high, and the fact that I own a company there would mean that I would not be able to maintain non-residency status (and thus am not exempt from Canadian taxes) =(",1173651338

It looks like you recently tried to submit a comment that tripped a bug in the software, possibly due to some weird characters in it.  If you can tell us what you were doing, it will help us diagnose the bug. Thanks.",1173650884

This is the root difference in the strategies; we stay in Iraq or Afghanistan because our leaders want to establish friendly governments there. If we left, the people would reject the sham governments we've installed and resort back to something that provides their needs, fundamentally, stability and security.<p>It's a privilege and a responsibility to live under what's considered a ""free"" government, and not everyone can handle that. You can't just waltz in and apply it universally across the globe and expect it to work, especially if the people of these other countries feel it was forced upon them. In these cases, there is too much contention and tribalism among the groups in the constituted nations to allow for a peaceful, useful democratic co-existence, which is one of the main reasons these governments do not form spontaneously in the area. The people there just can't handle that kind of system as it is, whatever your opinion on that system is, either for unwillingness, resentment, or inability, and forcing it only makes the problem worse.<p>You can't take a newborn and try to force it to walk. All that will do is harm the baby physically and harm your relationship psychologically. The capacity just isn't there. Even if you spend lots of money on harnesses and things that keep the baby in a bipedal stance, and cuffs and strings to lift his legs, it's not the same thing, and doing this only stands to worsen the situation overall. If you allow the child to develop these capacities naturally in his own time, everything is good and happy.<p>We have to allow the natural growth of these things. Our puppet governments don't work because the people don't accept them, and they especially will resent anyone who invades their territory to impose a ""better way"" on them. How would the US feel if China invaded and said, ""This is for your own good, so that you can learn the glories of Communism, so that you are free from your oppressive corporatist leaders.""?<p>Do you think, even if China is right there, any American will accept that?

However, as I'm a full-time student without a job, dropping out and not working at Burger King boils down to getting lucky (although I've had a few headhunters call me, so maybe that's a start).<p>The reason I'm so underwhelmed is that in highschool, I really took off with a passion for computer programming. By my senior year, I was fairly fluent in Python and PHP, and I was spending time reading and working my hardest to finish the exercises in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. In addition to that, I started working (and have kept on working) at mastering C, Common Lisp and Haskell. It was somewhere between starting to read ""Godel, Escher, Bach"" and learning the basics of the theory of computation that I also fell in love with mathematics. I was pretty apathetic towards everything related to highschool, but I could take AP classes and get an 'A' with no effort while spending the rest of my time studying things I cared about, so it didn't seem all that bad. When applying to college, I had scores to get into/get noticed by a couple of nice-to-decent range schools (Columbia, RIT, Rose Hulman; my GPA/scores were consistent with the bar for Duke, CMU and others). The problem is, while I had put in minimal effort to get a really high GPA and nice test scores, I wasn't the minority captain of the football YMCA church team thing, so I didn't really stand a chance of getting scholarships at nicer schools. Since I have to pay for everything myself, I decided to enroll at the state university which gave me a nice chunk of cash to attend. Problem solved, right?<p>Fast forward to college, where my first programming class considers 'for' looping and arrays to be advanced techniques, and where showing that you know more than what is taught is actually considered <i>cheating</i>, and I'm burnt after the first semester. The thing is, there are so many things that I don't know (and so many of them are things that I want to learn), so the idea of just 'dropping out' is absurd, since I'm sure there are people here who can help me learn the material even better than if I was doing it on my own. At the same time, every class is a boring trudge that promises me that it's the last boring class I'll have to take and then it'll all be exciting from here and blah blah blah blah. The litmus test I used recently was ""If I didn't have a scholarship, would I pay to take this class?"" I realized that I probably would not pay for a single CS class offered here. I made it through last semester fairly unscathed, but this time around I feel an extreme apathy setting in. My grades are just at the beginning point of slipping - they're not quite terrible, but they're not the high 'A's I'm used to. This is purely due to my lack of interest.<p>What should I do? Should I just drop out? That seems like a bad idea, since at this point I know enough to know I don't know that much at all. Should I switch to something non-CS, and then just study CS on my own while occasionally popping in and picking the brains of the faculty? I'm sure some of you who've been through this exact dilemma are scoffing at me not finding the obvious answer myself through ""soul-searching"", but I really haven't found anyone who feels the same way I do to discuss this with. I've gone for too long without asking for help or advice.",1266466890

The interesting bits of a Mandelbrot set plot are the ones that are on the boundary of the set itself. Remember that the Mandelbrot set is the set of points for which a particular iteration never diverges to infinity. So a point outside the set but very very close will diverge very very slowly: it will take a lot of iterations before you can tell it's outside the set. (The colours you see in a typical Mandelbrot set plot indicate how many iterations it takes.) So, if you zoom really close in then every point in your plot either lies outside the set but takes many iterations to determine that, or lies inside the set (and therefore takes as many iterations as you're prepared to do).<p>So you're doing more iterations, with higher-precision numbers, as you zoom closer in.",1266465940

His illustration of a good introduction uses this principle without identifying it as such (""I argue . . .; I acknowledge . . .""). It is amazing how much more compelling your prose will be simply by making clear that the argument presented is <i>yours</i> and not some derivative rip-off. Putting things in the first person reminds you that you are the one doing the thinking, the asserting, and the substantiating. It also reads much more cleanly and lets you easily avoid the sort of passive-voice flab (e.g., ""It is asserted herein . . ."") that so often characterizes academic writing.<p>I haven't been a student for over 30 years and only wish that I had access to such a helpful guide in my day.

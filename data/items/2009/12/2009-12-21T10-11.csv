I'm personally a huge fan of Slashdot's moderation system - one where there is both a minimum and maximum ""karma"" on a post, and the context of this rating is also recorded (e.g. +5 Insightful).<p>There's certainly room to improve on this model - I for one would like to see a ""-1 Uncivil"". Either way, where Reddit and Digg have repeatedly struggled with designing a sustainable commenting system, Slashdot's has stayed relatively constant for years, and the moderation quality has also been similarly consistent. This is not a trivial accomplishment.<p>IMHO the problem with ""raw"" upvotes and downvotes is that it is very difficult to circumvent the mob mentality, and that this system absolutely fails to scale with the population of the community. IMHO the Slashdot system works far better for large communities than what the competition seems to have going.",1261392803

There is no paradox in automation, just a simple sensationalism desire from the authors.<p>Everyday, there are thousands of accidents in the world(mainly cars) just because human errors,like distractions, and if no automation existed there will be dozens of airplane accidents everyday, given the enormous number of flights.<p>It's not human intervention what is needed, it's just something as simple as a proper error reporting system. If an accelerometer fails and nothing happens, just report :ACCELEROMETER FAILED and problem solved.
That a GPS failed, just report: GPS FAILED, and problem solved. Just change the redundant accelerometer, GPS when in land-port.<p>This is what human beings do, when one eye-ear-inertial information has nothing to do with the other, we got dizziness sick.<p>If someone designed the system badly, is not fault of automation, it's fault of the engineers.

Ignoring for the fact that it won't/can't happen ...<p>I've been in groups where most people spoke several languages sufficiently fluently not to care (and in some cases not to know!) which they were speaking.  Every time this has happened the language in use changed according to the topic being discussed, sometimes in mid-word.  Sometimes one language just makes it easier to talk about something than another.<p>In one book I have read it says something along the lines of:<p><pre><code>    One speaks of love and such trivia in French, of food
    in Italian, of tragedy in Russian, does business in
    German, and addresses the servants in English.
</code></pre>
Although the book itself is a parody, the passage rings true (although perhaps not in specifics).<p>Similarly, I regularly program in AWK, Python, C, C++, and ARM assembler, and I dabble in Lisp, Lua, OCaml and Haskell. In each case I reach for my most comfortable tool for what I'm working on, and it's not always the same one.<p>So I think if everyone were equally fluent in every language, there would be a pidgin arise, a language that is a mixture of the others, possibly with sub-languages for specific subjects.",1261392212

1007536,comment,1006787,1006787,0,0,Estragon,,,"I did a few hundred rounds with lingt.  It's fantastic.  Here's a couple of comments:<p>1) Perhaps there are theoretical reasons for this, but it surprised me that the characters are always presented in conjunction with their pinyin.  I would have thought it would be better to train for recognition of the characters unaided by the pinyin, some of the time.<p>2) It was taking a long time to respond to my input, at times, and this was resulting in input I didn't intend.  E.g., I would go to click ""I don't know"" right near the end of the allotted time, and this would get translated into a click on the subsequent round.  Usually, that click would be in the wrong area for that round.  There were also a couple of times where the answer it offered was clearly wrong, based on what was presented on the screen.  If you want to find these cases, you may be able to get it from your analytics.

Ignoring the many and varied grammatical rules that languages have for a moment and just consider vocabulary.<p>Lets say you need around 3,000 words for a normal day to day conversation (though I suspect that it might be higher). That 3,000 words in Chinese, 3,000 words in German, 3,000 in Farsi. You get the idea. There has got to be more than 2,000 living languages in the world - admittedly some of them have only a handful of speakers - so you will need to remember 6,000,000 vocabulary items.<p>That alone is a nightmare but remember that not all words have direct translations from one language to another, English does not distinguish gender the same way that Arabic does.

How would you comprehensively represent every interesting workload in an analytical model? How would you derive it from real world applications? It is impossible in the general case (halting problem), and really, really hard to do even in specialized cases. If you think otherwise, the field of worst-case execution time analysis awaits your contribution eagerly (try modeling L1 and L2 instruction and data cache interactions in a multicore CPU).<p>Thus, in many cases evaluating different interesting workloads empirically is unavoidable. In  such cases, 100 pages of setup, methodology, and analysis are a feature, and not necessarily a sign of mediocrity. There is a great danger of overlooking substantial flaws in brief descriptions.<p>So, yes, mediocrity can lead to inflated sections, but a good PhD committee will not led that slide.

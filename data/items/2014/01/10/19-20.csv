7038961,comment,7038200,7038200,18,0,seanellis,,,"I am largely to blame for the recent tirade against “growth hacking.” I’ve let the term be bastardized and redefined a lot since my original blog post on it back in 2010 <a href""http://www.startup-marketing.com/where-are-all-the-growth-hackers"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.startup-marketing.com/where-are-all-the-growth-ha...</a> . I wrote that blog post primarily for <i>startups</i> that had achieved product/market fit. The idea was not to replace marketing, but to create a category of marketing activities that have a direct attributable impact on growth. Startups are always on the brink of death. They don’t have the luxury to focus on things like awareness building or to prepare 50 page slide decks on the demographics of the customer. I wrote that a startup’s first marketing hire should have “growth as their true north.” They shouldn’t be outsourcing and managing vendors, the person should be a hands-on “builder” and optimizer of growth programs. In order to help make the concept stick, I put a name to it. On that day the term “growth hacker” was born.<p>I won’t rehash why all this debate is actually a good thing. Read my comment here <a href""http://www.growthhackers.com/dhh-growth-hacking-a-cool-sounding-euphemism-for-making-the-doer-feel-good-about-using-the-same-old-sleazy-marketing-tricks"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.growthhackers.com/dhh-growth-hacking-a-cool-sound...</a> for my thoughts on that…<p>Since my original post in 2010, I’ve been happy with certain evolutions of the term. One is that I think large companies should have a group that is exclusively focused on managing the activities that are directly attributable to growth. Companies like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter have had these groups for a long time. Bigger companies have the luxury of specialization so they can have research departments, PR departments and I think “growth” should be a focused discipline within larger organizations. Part of this group’s objective should be to create a culture of growth across the entire organization and help each department evaluate and measure activities that have a direct impact on growth.<p>“Growth hacking” may or may not be the right word, but it’s the one I used and it stuck.<p>Much as SEO is a categorization of marketing activities that improve a websites search ranking, you can think of growth hacking as a broader categorization of marketing activities that directly and measurably impact growth. In my original post, I suggested that the role should be easier to hire than a VP Marketing, since the scope of focus is actually smaller. I also suggested that some of the best growth people I’ve met have engineering backgrounds. It wasn’t until Andrew Chen’s post “Growth Hacker is the New VP Marketing” that people really began to focus in on engineering skills as a prerequisite for being an effective growth hacker. He also falsely positioned it as a replacement for VP Marketing. I both disagree that it is the new VP Marketing and I disagree that engineering is a prerequisite. A VP Marketing needs to have a broader understanding of all of the disciplines within the marketing function. Some growth hackers will be good for this and some won’t.<p>Lastly, you could easily argue that SEO as a concept doesn’t need to exist because marketing already exists. But SEO is a subset of marketing activities. Growth hacking (to me anyway) is a subset of marketing activities too. The most powerful online marketing tactics often involve exploiting the unique advantages of the internet, which generally require some engineering skills. It’s easier to run these experiments if you don’t need to beg an engineering department for help. So engineering skills are definitely an advantage, but results trump skills.<p>Apologize to all that the conversation will likely to shift to a “defense of growth hacking” for a while. But eventually we’ll be back to the sharing of effective ways to grow the user bases for products that customers love.",1389383908

I&#x27;ve always been under the impression that raising animals is vastly more resource intensive than just feeding yourself on plants.<p>the cows (and other grazing animals in their group) evolved very special stomach to consume the grass (parts of grasses) which aren&#x27;t consumable by predators like humans.<p>The comparison of consuming human-edible plants (or their parts) directly vs. feeding it to cows is rooted in industrialized beef production where corn is fed to cows. Such wasteful conversion of human edible food into more tastier/pricier human edible food allows for higher revenue and larder total profits - people will eat the same calories, beef is just more expensive packaging of it and thus generates more total revenue and profit in the societies which can afford it and want it.<p>>I&#x27;d still expect grain to be even easier to get -- animals are something of a luxury item<p>In normal situation, cows milk is a source of calories _additional_ to the grain as cows are fed on grasses grown where grain cultivation doesn&#x27;t make much sense - short summer, not plain land, etc...

The cows feed today also includes processed waste from other areas of food industry - the quality of this stuff varies greatly from country to country depending on regulations and industry and society mentality about it.",1389383511

I&#x27;d count that as a toolbar. Happened to me just last week when I installed software on Windows 8.1. Chrome definitely is just as prone to infected additions. Count me as surprised.<p>Re: WebRTC, how long has that actually worked? WebRTC is still under development. It if worked in the last few months chances are it didn&#x27;t work the same way before. Chances are it won&#x27;t keep working that way later. It&#x27;s exciting tech, I love WebRTC but calling it a missing feature before it&#x27;s landed for a few months is kind of asking for a bit much, even for Firefox and Chrome (audio APIs, MathML, JavaScript language features, &c). The fact these two browsers interoperate at all is because of a ton of hard work they put into collaborating to make things work. Of course, &quot;work&quot; being defined by what is easiest for their current implementations to change. Still, you probably assumed I was trying to bash WebRTC, I&#x27;m not but it&#x27;s very new tech in terms of the current interoperable feature set. Give it six months and then come back to complain.<p>I&#x27;m glad you solved your Chrome issues with tracing C++ code. Sucks when that happens.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this makes supporting IE entirely impossible and super painful. You have so many fewer variables in play with the IE release cycle that it&#x27;s hard to complain. I&#x27;ve had Chrome bugs that triggered on only certain builds on certain operating systems that took me a ton of work to reproduce. Looks like the problem reported here is not hitting everyone either but it&#x27;s already narrowed down to only a few possible versions and operating systems.<p>To make things worse, Chrome didn&#x27;t have much help on debugging on mobile devices for a long time. It was quite hard to get an accurate rendering and runtimes with complete debugging.<p>The IE VM isn&#x27;t slow here. I just downloaded and tried it to write this comment. I get WebGL and all running in my VM. Not sure what you&#x27;re talking about. Felt fast to me.<p>Anyway... I&#x27;m not an apologist. I build software and honestly most of these rants I see are complete FUD. They show either ignorance about what options are available or the bias of choosing one flavor of proprietary over another.

As far as what&#x27;s right and wrong is concerned, I should be able to leave the door wide open if I so choose. It&#x27;s my car. If someone comes along and steals my car, however, I would call that wrong and the thief is at fault. Obviously, I don&#x27;t want my car stolen (because I need its utility) so I take preventative insurance measures to avoid the potential burden of losing use of my car, talking to the police, and hunting down the thief. But, imho, that&#x27;s my choice and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m actively causing others harm by leaving my windows down.<p>To add some genderism to the fire: if a woman choses to wear clothes that some would consider &quot;provocative&quot; is it her fault that she gets raped because she was inviting undue male attention? Is she simply &quot;asking for it&quot;? I don&#x27;t think so. And I think it&#x27;s a human&#x27;s right to freely express him or herself as s/he choses. If I want to leave the window to my car down, that&#x27;s up to me, the owner of the car. If someone steals my car, that&#x27;s their fault.<p>As far as software security is concerned, I think there are definitely reasonable and unreasonable steps that can be taken in the development of it. But I don&#x27;t expect the developers of the software I use to be on the edge of their seats watching the internet for the every single security exploit that pops up so that they can instantly apply a patch. I do expect them to take reasonable steps to reasonably secure the software, and when something becomes obvious, to deal with it. When I entrust the storage of my personal details with a website, I have certain expectations about how that information is handled, but I don&#x27;t expect it to be 100% impervious to attack.<p>I also think there lies some responsibility with the user to choose to use software they trust (trust being a spectrum, not a binary distinction). For example, I wouldn&#x27;t expect a lot of security from some kind of seedy porn software, and would actually expect the software to actively compromise my system. If I chose to install such software, I think I&#x27;d be partly liable for installing something that is obviously insecure. But I have different expectations from my banking software. I think those expectations, which are relative to particular industries and markets, and which are fuzzy and ill-defined, are partly a user&#x27;s responsibility (but not wholly... I still expect my bank to reimburse me if someone breaks into their database and steals my money).<p>My point is that liability in software security, to me, is a fluctuating grey area, and that the areas are defined differently for different kinds of software which should, at least partially, be apparent (and avoidable) to the end user.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to defend Snapchat or say that you should leave your car unlocked, just that I think these kinds of issues are not black and white, nor that one party is 100% wrong and another party is 100% right.",1389382285

7038766,comment,7037532,7037532,1,0,Futurebot,,,"A general comment on the nature of activism and the political process: one of the goals of activism in the political area is to move both public sentiment (awareness / consciousness raising) and public policy. Now, one of the things to realize here is that this is a never-ending back and forth process, and sometimes the same battles are fought in different forms over time - and this can be incredibly frustrating unless you realize that this is the case. It&#x27;s easy to believe that it&#x27;s like fixing a bug; once you&#x27;ve patched policy/changed the mind of society on a topic, that it&#x27;s fixed forever. Not so. New forms of an idea pick up; your favored policy falls out of favor due to changing events/other beliefs/ideologies/cultures that become popular; a new generation is born that has none of the bad experiences you had, and can have bad policies foisted on them; zombie ideas rise from the grave once more.<p>This can be disheartening, frustrating, even despondency-inducing. I&#x27;ve been there more than once, and activists across the world have probably been experiencing this since the first protest happened outside the first town hall.<p>For those stating &quot;it will do nothing&quot; - it can sometimes be hard to see the distant / second-order effects, but they do matter. Registering dissent matters. Now, I would add that there is a threshold beyond which activism loses its potency (for a variety of possible reasons) and you need to go to the next level (everything from non-violent resistance to revolutions.) In this particular case, we&#x27;re nowhere near that, and by the looks of it, the tide is firmly against the anti-surveillance bloc, so pile on.<p>Finally, I&#x27;d say that the idea that the arc of the universe bends towards justice is wrong; people bend societies towards it.",1389382041

A few years back we did a small monthly ad spend via facebook, basically display ads with very cheap CPM&#x27;s and even then pretty great demo targeting, but poor results. It was cheap and semi relevant so we continued on.<p>In the last 3-6 months many of the Co&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been working with\nhave greatly expanded their FB advertising with CPA&#x27;s on par or better than Adwords Search. It&#x27;s very important to separate branded and non branded search terms on Adwords when evaluating a campaign. Non branded is what matters for evaluating effectivess of Search campaigns.<p>FB has a huge advantage in demographic targeting.  There are only so many relevant queries on Adwords and once you have covered your bases with relevant KW&#x27;s, its hard to profitably scale past that stage.  You can endlessly optimize but the gains are incremental.<p>I agree that buying likes on FB is not great, the exception is if your super targeted by demo and location, and then do friends of friends lead campaigns on top of the newly acquired likes, that can work, but it takes patience and a bit of budget.<p>FB&#x27;s rising stock price is a direct result of their expanding share of advertising budgets.",1389381272

We know that Facebook and maybe Google, too, collect information about people not using their services. They also track their users&#x27; behavior when they&#x27;re not expecting it.

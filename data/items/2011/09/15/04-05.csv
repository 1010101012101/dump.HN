It's expensive, and I doubt there's much evidence about the long-term effects on the students.<p>I'd guess they don't take it far enough to be useful.  When people first experience cold, hunger, fear and exhaustion, most focus on their suffering, and feel helpless.  You can learn to take the discomfort for granted, focus on your actions, and feel proud.  That takes more experience and mentoring than the average student gets.<p>Also, being able to handle the normal stuff is good, but not caring about it at all is bad, and the middle ground can be hard to find.  Tim Winton's novel, <i>Breath</i>, develops that idea.",1316062697

When used as a mobile device, the interface looks like iPhone/Metro. When you are at your desk, you dock it and the interface that pops up on your 30 inch monitor is like Windows 7 (WIMP). And you can also dock it in a range of shells (for lack of a better word) from a 7-inch tablet (touchscreen UI) to a 17-inch laptop (WIMP UI). All these devices you are docking to are just relatively cheap shells. All your data and processing power is on the smartphone.

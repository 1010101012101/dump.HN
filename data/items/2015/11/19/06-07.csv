Women may avoid talking about this stuff because it makes them targets, and they may not need more trouble. Guys can and should talk about this; it&#x27;s our chance to use our gender privilege to reduce the problem.<p>My experience is that for any given feminist statement I get 90-100% less crap than women do. I hear some squeaks from the antifeminists, but very little from the active misogynists and other abusive shitheels. If you&#x27;re right and PG is unwilling to take even mild heat when he could easily do so, I don&#x27;t feel obliged to respect that. Especially after his big talk about him getting all the credit because he&#x27;s more comfortable in the spotlight.<p>If PG really didn&#x27;t want to talk about gender discrimination because Jessica, he could have just said so.

The one or <i>maybe</i> two items that are actually healthy (and by &quot;actually healthy&quot;, I just mean real food; something you can make from a plant or animal without a chemist&#x27;s involvement) have to be picked out from dozens of nearly-identical SKUs that are deceptively labeled.<p>Try this on someone who doesn&#x27;t know you&#x27;re going to try it on them: check the ingredients and values on someone&#x27;s healthy food item that they got at a mainstream grocer (Target is almost the same as Walmart, they just have a more prominent nut section) and see how much sweetener was added to it. My health-conscious buddies usually find out that their premium &quot;super-healthy&quot; green band 100% whole grain wheat bread has added sugar.<p>I actually have bought real maple syrup at Walmart. It was tucked in the very top corner of the shelf and there were only three units stocked. By contrast, there was a whole section of thickened, dyed sugar water syrup on the wall, probably 25 SKUs. Again, the issue is not that it&#x27;s hypothetically impossible, the issue is that 99.9% of the patrons, even those who are intentionally trying to buy a healthy option, are not going to be able to do it successfully. There&#x27;s a reason for that, and that reason is that the grocer, the distributor, the manufacturer, and all the rest of the way up the supply chain, they don&#x27;t want you to be able to buy healthier, because access to more filling, low calorie options means not only that you&#x27;ll be healthier, but that ultimately you&#x27;ll buy a lot less food.",1447914945

Whether it&#x27;s natural or not, I still find it incredibly stupid. The focus on ideas seems wrong in itself. The usual discussions like whether Free Market or Government-Regulated Market are Better‚Ñ¢ are pointless; we should be talking about whether a free-market solution or a top-down solution is better <i>for a particular problem</i>, like determining wages or building a power plant.<p>I mean, the level of absurdity of buying ideas wholesale is obvious to everyone in almost every single discipline besides politics. Static vs. dynamic typing, or Lisp vs. rest of the world, or why PHP sucks are fun topics to discuss, but when push comes to shove, everyone knows that they should use the best tool for the job and get the job done.<p>Imagine for a moment that we&#x27;re tasked with writing a grep-like utility.

If there is a fraudulent transaction of $100, then square has to compensate it with 200 transactions of $100 each. (200 txns *0.5 gross margin). Net effect is not only do they have to deal with low margins, they also have to manage risk very well. And this is not something you accomplish overnight especially as you enter new markets. Personal anecdote: I had $120 or so disappear from my Starbucks wallet a couple of months ago and the merchant had to eat the loss.<p>Lastly, large payment processors get out of this loop because they manage the big (Targets and Walmarts of the world) with the small and over time have fine tuned their risk engine. Square went into it in the reverse order, targeting mom-and-pop stores first (which have low volumes and high acquisition costs) and then trying their hand at large merchants (Startbucks in this case and they lost a ton doing this).

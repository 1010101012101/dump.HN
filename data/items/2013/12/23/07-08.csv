I wonder if, as a security company, they might assess how complying with a request to use a specific generator by default might weaken their products or introduce potential backdoors into their products, even if that method is not known to be flawed.<p>Are they claiming that they received the contract and said &quot;$10 mil just to switch the default? Hell yes! I&#x27;m not asking questions!&quot;. Making changes without question would be a security concern. Making changes with question would also be a security concern unless they have significant confidence that it&#x27;s <i>not</i> flawed and there&#x27;s good reason to switch. It sounds like might have been the case, but if the reason is good then why would someone offer you $10M?<p>And I wonder what their options were in accepting it or not accepting it.

Consider that oasis occupied if either the enemy&#x27;s king is captured, or if your king can camp there for X moves (if your king can camp there, the area can&#x27;t be part of the front anymore, so it is truly yours)<p>I chose an oasis rather than a true stronghold such as a fort or castle because a fort or castle would have to mean the introduction of separate rules for attacks into and out of the stronghold (hm, that might be fun, too.

Then both clients will see the same identicon (&quot;visualization key&quot;, &#x27;cause it will be a presentation of SHA1 applied to zero).<p>However, judging by further manipulation with the &quot;shared secret&quot; key (because MTProto doesn&#x27;t use Diffie-Hellman method of multiplying by  g^ab^-1 or any multiplication by the shared key whatsoever) the multiplication by zero will not happen with client messages and they will successfully flow through the &quot;bare&quot; AES ( and therefore users will think that everything is fine and will proceed to transmitting sensitive data in this mode ).<p>P.

The clothing fashion world shows this most clearly, in that creating knockoffs of today&#x27;s fashions isn&#x27;t even that technically challenging, and yet there is still a &quot;high class&quot; fashion world for those who care to participate in.<p>huh.  That seems like a pretty good scenario to me.   I mean, the current state of clothing is... well, it&#x27;s pretty great for the poor, and for people who don&#x27;t want to spend a lot on clothing.  And people who want to spend a lot of money on clothing seem to be happy, and people who want to pretend like they are spending a lot of money on clothing also seem to be happy,  High-quality clothing that is in good repair but that is used and out of style is nearly free.   so I really don&#x27;t see the problem.<p>My problem is that from what I&#x27;ve seen?  when eating out, there&#x27;s a very dramatic difference between what I get for $5 and what I get for $50.

In many ways better than the diesel jeans.    Of course, I&#x27;m wearing jeans I bought at Costco, and that says things socially, but I&#x27;m pretty okay with that.   They are good jeans.   In fact, I&#x27;ve worn my costco jeans while eating $50 dinners.<p>If I could walk into a McDonalds (or costco) and buy a $5 meal that was functionally equivalent (minus the social cache) to a $50 meal?

If the issuer refuses fraud protection to you for whatever reason your credit rating is on the line if you don&#x27;t pay off the balance. They may sue you, and they may damage your ability to get credit for a long time.<p>In other words, the situation between debit and credit card protection is basically the same: in both cases the issuer will almost certainly protect you, and you&#x27;re screwed if they don&#x27;t.<p>> To hack a debit card, the attacker must intercept both the mag stripes and the PIN that goes with them.<p>This is not true in the USA.

Those are already immutable:<p><pre><code>    var fooString = &quot;foo&quot;;\n    var secondFooString = fooString;\n    secondFooString;  // => &quot;foo&quot;\n    \n    fooString = &quot;bar&quot;;\n    secondFooString;  // => &quot;foo&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWe set the variable fooString to point to a different string, but the original, underlying string <i>hasn&#x27;t changed</i>. In JavaScript, we can think of a string as a <i>value</i>.<p>This is not the case with arrays in JavaScript:<p><pre><code>    var firstArray = [1, 2, 3];\n    var secondArray = firstArray;\n    \n    firstArray[0] = 100;\n    firstArray;  // => [100, 2, 3]\n    secondArray;  // => also [100, 2, 3]\n</code></pre>\nBecause we can change the underlying contents of the array, an array in JavaScript isn&#x27;t a value. It&#x27;s a <i>place</i>: a reference to a location in memory. The underlying value could be changed at any time.<p>But, using Mori, collections are values, just like strings:<p><pre><code>    var firstVec = m.vector(1, 2, 3);\n    var secondVec = firstVec;\n    \n    firstVec = m.assoc(firstVec, 0, 100);\n    firstVec;  // => [100, 2, 3]\n    secondVec;  // => still [1, 2, 3]\n</code></pre>\nInstead of modifying firstVec in place, mori.assoc creates a new vector that is identical to firstVec except for the change we want. We then assign the result to firstVec. secondVec is unchanged. We are unable to go in and change the underlying values because a vector is a value, not a place.<p>The most obvious way to build this would be to deep-copy the entire collection when it&#x27;s changed, but that would of course be way too slow and wasteful — imagine copying a one-million-long array just to change one element.

The card processor historically charges the retailer a smaller %age of the transaction total if they can supply the full track info, since that implies the retailer physically saw the card and so cuts down on ‘card not present’ fraud. Ironic, isn’t it?<p>Historically the pinpad has given the unencrypted data to the POS terminal, where the application is responsible for authorising the card (either over dial up line or internet connection) with the card processor. Note that the POS application typically does not do this itself – it hands it off to a dedicated application on the POS terminal to do that. So in this case we’ve already got unencrypted data going from the pinpad to the POS application to the processing application. Whether the processing application encrypts the data is between it and the bank, but most of the ones I’m aware of don’t (or at least didn’t when I dealt with them).\nNow, modern pinpads have the abilty to authorise themselves directly with the processor without even giving the card info to the POS terminal, but that then requires a pinpad have internet access, with all the headaches that entails …<p>re: storing of card numbers by retailers\nConsumers are lazy. We like being able to return a gift without a receipt, and have the retailer look up the transaction based on the card we used to make the purchase.\nWe also like being able to log in to our favourite website and make a purchase, billing it to the card we used last time. In both cases the retailer has to store the card # & expiry date in order to make this work.\nSure, the retailer can not do this, but how many customers are they likely to lose to the store next door which does offer this functionality? It’s only when something goes wrong that we start complaining about it.<p>re: writing “Check ID” on the signature line of the card\nThe signature on a credit card is not to prove you are the cardholder, it’s to say you agree to the terms and conditions of the card. If the card isn’t signed then the retailer has no way to know that once they give you the goods you will actually pay the card company – obviously you can still not do that (hence all the people in credit card debt), but there’s a difference between not paying the card company when you are legally obligated to, and not even having the obligation. In the first the card company will come after you for lack of payment, in the second the retailer is effectively giving you the product with no recourse to anyone if you don’t pay.\nThe reason most people get away with it is because (a) most people don’t know the rules and (b) most store managers and cashiers don’t want to be the one to enforce it.\nSee <a href=\"http://usa.visa.com/merchants/risk_management/card_present.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://usa.visa.com/merchants/risk_management/card_present.h...</a> for more details.<p>The retailer could quite easily mandate to their staff that all card purchases in store require a check of photo ID, but that takes longer (who wants their checkout time to take even longer?) and puts the onus on the cashier to verify the identity (and the retailer probably wouldn’t want that either).&quot;",1387782299
6953410,comment,6953041,6953315,3,0,cynwoody,,,"Nothing.<p>The difference is that, when fraudsters hit your credit card, you&#x27;re not out any money, <i>ab initio</i>. You call the card company and make them take the fraudulent charge off your bill. If they refuse, they have to sue to get your money. But if the bad boys nail your debit card, your account is dinged immediately, and you have to deal with the bank to get your funds restored.<p>Therefore, you should use ATM cards at ATMs only and only use credit cards to shop and travel and dine out (and enjoy the float and the points and pay in full every month). If your ATM card has a credit card logo (called a &quot;check card&quot;), call your bank and complain, and they&#x27;ll issue you one that is <i>only</i> an ATM card and <i>cannot</i> be used to shop without a PIN.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the Target case is confined to credit cards, not debit cards. To hack a debit card, the attacker must intercept both the mag stripes and the PIN that goes with them. That&#x27;s hard to do, given the way PIN pads work. Reportedly, in the Target case, they did not succeed in doing that.",1387782289

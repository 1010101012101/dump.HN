However, with my limited understanding of the research, I’d somewhat disagree with this:<p>> …author&#x27;s claim that objects aren&#x27;t really there turns out to be more provocative than substantial. The author takes conscious agents as the building blocks of reality, and the conscious agents are still there when you aren&#x27;t looking. They are just a different representation. You can replace the term &quot;conscious agent&quot; with anything.<p>My understanding is as follows: conscious agents, as the foundation, exist unperceived. What we see, however, is not a representation of said agents—not a ‘map’. Rather, it’s a hugely simplified interface to the world of interactions between said agents. As symbols of the interface, objects or even space-time can’t be claimed to exist when we’re not looking.<p>It’s like an API spec that describes various entities and whatever manipulations we can request on them. These Users and Posts don’t actually exist as such, but for our practical purposes they’re always there, helpfully constructed. As API consumer we can fetch a user whenever we need it, but network can be down between our requests for all we know. (A precise map then could probably be raw SQL shell, the complexity of which API hides. I know this analogy is far from ideal, but it somewhat helped me understand some aspects of the idea.)",1436093970

9833134,comment,9831680,9831680,0,0,gizi,,,"When the Greek government originally borrowed their debts, they did so mostly from commercial banks in other EU countries. Therefore, the first Greek crisis was systemically dangerous. It had the potential of dragging the entire EU banking system into the mud. In the meanwhile, these commercial EU banks have been able to offload their Greek debt paper onto their own governments and onto supranational EU organizations. Today, a Greek default would no longer put the EU banking system in jeopardy. It is the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and similar organizations at national and international level that would see a hole appearing in their financial paperwork, if Greece defaulted.<p>Therefore, the point of view of Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, makes a lot of sense. Let Greece simply default and let the current debt holders dump the Greek paper on the open market, where it will trade at cents to the Euro. Inasmuch as Greece finds more money in the future, the Greek government can try to buy back debt paper in order to destroy it. The current holders of Greek paper would indeed lose money but in fact they have lost that money already. If they simply had the courage to let the open market value their holdings, they would see today already that most of the value has already gone. Nobody has any hope of seeing the money back represented by the Greek debt paper. Why not just admit it?<p>Historical lesson: Borrowing large amounts from EU banks is a one-way bet. Their governments will not let these banks go bankrupt and therefore, if need be, they will take over the debt. Since these governments cannot collect the debt either, they will eventually have to forgive the debt.",1436093212

I can&#x27;t claim to be fluent in all of them at this moment, but I can quickly ramp up to a productive level in a matter of a few days.<p>Now if I had to pick three languages, they would probably be something along the lines of:<p>1. C. This language has been relevant for 40 years, and will remain relevant for at least another 40 years. Low level understanding of computer operation is paramount for a lot of advanced tasks.<p>2. Python/Ruby/Lua. A dynamic &quot;scripting&quot; language is very useful to get stuff done quickly when you need it.<p>3. A functional language: Haskell, ML or Lisp. Knowledge of this paradigm will make you a better programmer, regardless whether or not you get to use it in your day job.<p>There are languages I&#x27;d like to add to this list, namely something like Java/C# (a &quot;managed&quot; imperative language).

In fact, experiments with different configurations have led me to start developing large React applications using a system that organizes applications by components like this:<p><pre><code>    src/index.js\n    src/ButtonThing/index.js\n    src/ButtonThing/view.js\n    src/ButtonThing/controller.js\n    src/ButtonThing/model.js\n    src/FormThing/index.js\n    src/FormThing/view.js\n    src/FormThing/controller.js\n    src/FormThing/model.js\n</code></pre>\nThen, you can simply import these components using something like:<p><pre><code>    var FormThing = require(&#x27;../FormThing&#x27;);\n</code></pre>\nAnd you can compose them, with one large component consisting of multiple small ones.  For this reason, I&#x27;ve found it useful with large applications to create a separate library of smaller components that are used in multiple larger components, so I don&#x27;t end up having to hard-code multi-level imports (ie, &#x27;../../../MyUsefulComponent&#x27;).<p>You&#x27;d need to use a slightly different structure with ES6 modules, but the main idea is the same.<p>If you&#x27;re using something like Flux to manage data, you can probably skip using the `model.js` modules and simply stick with a `view.js` and `controller.js` (or however you wish to name it).<p>The way I&#x27;ve done this, all CSS goes into the view.js modules, but you could use a separate style.css in each component.<p>I&#x27;ve found that this organizational approach works great for large JavaScript applications.<p>Finally, regarding testing, with React I&#x27;ve <i>finally</i> been able to consistently apply easy command-line unit testing to DOM code without worrying about setting up PhantomJS or JSDom and struggling to get initial tests working.  It&#x27;s made unit testing much, much easier, and I find I&#x27;m much more inclined to keep a high level of test coverage maintained with React applications than with previous JS applications I&#x27;ve created.  React makes testing very easy (I know AngularJS also is said to offer easy testing, but I&#x27;ve not used it outside of a few small JS applications).",1436091096

In other words, it <i>compiles</i> this DSL into the host language.<p>For example, a macro which defines a parser. Inside it is a BNF (or PEG), a very high level language. Macro must <i>compile</i> this language into Rust, and, since it is a very high level language, there are tons of optimisation opportunities that would be totally missed by the underlying Rust and LLVM because they lack this domain-specific knowledge.<p>Your macro will compile this source DSL in multiple stages (well, because this is the only sane approach to compilation anyway, read about the Nanopass framework for more details). First it will operate on an AST level, do some analysis, error reporting, inlining, may annotate the detected left recursive nodes and binary expression nodes. Then you&#x27;d lower it down into the trivial Packrat building blocks - still a tree. But now you notice that there is a lot of redundant reads from the input stream, and if you flatten this tree into an SSA you can optimise them all away.<p>Alas, after such an optimisation you&#x27;d have to promote it back to tree in order to generate Rust, because there is no `goto`.<p>And this is only one trivial example. In my practice there were dozens such DSLs. For example, same story is with an optimising WAM-based embedded Prolog DSL, multiple querying DSLs, tree walking DSLs (which are essential for implementing macros efficiently).",1436091008

A narrow band of &quot;interesting&quot; is allowed, but not something which triggers defensiveness.<p>Thus, the optimal way to teach the reader is to find a way for them to engage in play with the idea and solve a mystery that unlocks the real information, creating the intentional effort without waking up the rationalization guards.<p>Conspiracy theories act as the foil to &quot;mainstream&quot; propaganda by presenting a story which is just fractionally harder to follow, but not tremendously so; the initial reader effort is basically one of &quot;what if They are lying to me?&quot; Subsequently the reader is showered with evidence that yes, they are being lied to. This point and counter-point effort allows people to remain anchored in a binary, yes-or-no, right-or-wrong framing of events and actions, where their identity and opinions can remain stable and confident.<p>There is an inevitability that a popular medium will hew close to surface dualism. Anything that achieves more in that realm hides something of itself.<p>Another way to think about it is that understanding is concentric - the group in the innermost circle can&#x27;t directly speak to the folks far in the outside. They have to teach the people they&#x27;re adjacent to, first.

When we watch a movie, they explained, we seem to experience a continuous flow of sound and motion as individual frames pass through a projector. The experience would be drastically different, however, if we had the chance to look at the film frame by frame.<p>&quot;This is exactly how my father [Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche] began to teach me to look at my mind. If I observed every thought, feeling, and sensation that passed through my mind, the illusion of a limited self would dissolve, to be replaced by a sense of awareness that is much more calm, spacious, and serene. And what I learned from other scientists was that because experience changes the neuronal structure of the brain, when we observe the mind this way, we can change the cellular gossip that perpetuates our experience of our &#x27;self&#x27;.&quot;",1436090702

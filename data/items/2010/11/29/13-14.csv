Interestingly, I will see him this weekend in Quebec City for the PhD defense of my wife. I agree with you guys that the title is too strong and we have to be careful when interpreting studies. Only few people fully realize that the obesity problem is complex and multifaceted. Nobody is immune. The causes and paths to weight gain are manifold and a narrow focus on the Big Two factors (unhealthy diet and physical inactivity) is not enough. For some people, factors such as short sleep duration, mental stress, socioeconomic status, drugs, etc. can cause weight gain and thereby should be included in the big picture. The main problem lies in the current 'obesogenic' environment that encourages overeating and sedentariness, and people are not able to swim upstream against those strong pressures. A change in the environment is more than needed at this point, because telling people to eat less and exercise more does not really work.",1291038552

I agree that ""international law"" can't be easily defined (and therefore can't be adhered to), and it is not always easy to judge the moral value of an act, particularly without the benefit of hindsight (one of the best known examples being the decision to use nuclear weapons on Japan), but there are other cases where it is clear.

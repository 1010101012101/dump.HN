9042652,comment,9039851,9039851,0,0,wkimeria,,,"I think saying that cars are limited to the citys elites is overstating the case a bit. There are quite a few middle class families with cars. The problem is twofold<p>1: The collapse of the public bus system (KBS or Kenya Bus Service) in the early 90s 
2: The lack of any investment in infrastructure since at least the 70s. There are a bunch of reasons (IMF structural adjustment, corruption, poor planning etc)<p>I&#x27;m kenyan and remember that in the 80s it was relatively quick for me to get to downtown Nairobi, or to School (for anyone who knows Nairobi, I was commuting from South B to Nairobi Primary School). I could either have my parents drop me (they worekd in the CBD and drove there), take a bus to downtown Nairobi and walk to school from there or take another bus to school (I used to opt to walk the 2nd leg and buy these really terrible SciFi books &#x27;Perry Rhodhan&#x27; that were translated to English from German, but thats another story...).<p>In 1980, the bus/matatu ride from South B to Downtown Nairobi (near Standard Chatered bank) took about 10-12 minutes. The last time I did this (in 2010, I needed to get from South B to the National Archives in the CBD so I hopped a #11 Matatu), it took 2 hours, and that was not in rush hour traffic. I could have gotten out and walked there faster (and regularly used to do so in the 80s, but everything is fenced off and over-built). The next day I drove with my mum and same thing (South B to Kariokor), there is literally no way of avoiding spending a large amount of your life sitting in traffic, and it boggles my mind that there are cities that are worse (i.e mexico City)<p>There are simply too many cars for the infrastructure. And in a really bone-headed move, some time ago the government decided to solve this problem by banning public service vehicles (buses and matatus) from the Central Business District, but private cars were allowed. Of course this was so the rich could travel un-impeded. The plan didn&#x27;t last due to the outcry, but that shows you the priorities of the politicians.<p>But if it meets its promise, this app would be truly amazing and useful. And the name (Hakuna Matatu), you have to understand Swahili to appreciate the pure awesomeness of that pun.",1423796321

9042616,comment,9038613,9042369,0,0,patrickmcmanus,,,"Its a fair question but the h2 approach is doing the right thing on balance. The issue isn&#x27;t really computational or memory requirements.<p>The startup phase of a TCP stream is essentially not governed by congestion control feedback because there hasn&#x27;t been enough (or maybe any) feedback yet. It is initially controlled by a constant (IW) and then slowly feels its way before dynamically finding the right rate. IW can generally range from 2 to 10 segments. Whether this is too much or too little for any individual circumstance is somewhat immaterial - its generally going to be wrong just because that&#x27;s the essence of the probing phase - you start with a guess and go from there.<p>Each stream has a beginning a middle and an end. 1 large stream has 1 beginning 1 (large) middle and 1 end, but N small streams have N beginnings N (smaller) middles, and N ends. The amount of data in the beginning is not a factor of the stream size (other than it being the max), it is rather governed by the latency and bandwidth of the network. So more streams means more data gets carried in the startup phase. If the beginning is known to be a poor performing stage (and for TCP it is) then creating more of them and having them cover more of the data is a bad strategy.<p>In practice, IW is too small for the median stream - but there is a wide distribution of &quot;right sizes&quot; so its ridiculously hard to get right.. maybe it is IW=10 and the right size is 30 segments; but that&#x27;s one stream 3x too small- it isn&#x27;t 20x or 50x too small, so when you open 50 parallel tcp connections you are effectively sending at IW * 50. And that does indeed cause congestion and packet loss.. and its not the kind of &quot;I dropped 1 packet from a run of 25 please use fast-retransmit or SACK to fix it for me&quot; packet loss we like to see.. its more of the &quot;that was a train wreck I need slow timers on the order of hundreds of milliseconds to try again for me&quot; packet loss that brings tears to my eyes. One of the reasons for this goes back to the N beginnings problem - if you lose a SYN or your last data packet the recovery process is inherently much slower, and N streams have N times more SYNS and &quot;last&quot; packets than 1 stream does. Oh, and 50 isn&#x27;t an exaggeration. HTTP routinely wants to generate a burst of 100 simultaneous requests these days (which is why header compression when doing multiplexing is critical - but that&#x27;s another post).<p>So the busier larger flow both induces less loss and is more responsive when it experiences loss. That&#x27;s a win.<p>And after all that you still have the priority problem. 50 uncoordinated streams all entering the network at slightly different times with slightly different amounts of data will be extremely chaotic wrt which data gets transferred first. And &quot;first&quot; matters a lot to the web - things like js/css/fonts all block you from using the web, but images might not.. and even within those images some are more important than others (some might not even turn out to be on the screen at first - oh wait, you just scrolled I need to change those priorities). Providing a coordination mechanism for that is one of the real pieces of untapped potential hiding in h2&#x27;s approach to mux everything together.<p>There is a downside. If you have a single non-induced loss (i.e. due to some other data source) and it impacts the early part of the 1 single tcp connection then it impacts all the other virtual streams because of tcp&#x27;s in-order delivery properties. If they were split into N tcp connections then only one of them would be impacted. This is a much discussed property in the networking community, and I&#x27;ve seen it in the wild - but nobody has demonstrated that it is a significant operational problem.<p>The h2 arrangement is the right thing to do in a straightforward TLS/HTTP1-COMPATIBLE-SEMANTIC/TCP.. making further improvements will involve breaking out of that traditional tcp box a bit (quic is an example, minion is also related, even mosh is related) and is appropriately separated as next-stage work that wasn&#x27;t part of h2. Its considerably more experimental.",1423795505

Very natural language, and start/end can be used to qualify all variables that are starty or endy. The biggest problem with the approach is that you have to think ahead of time about what your variables mean, and they might become fairly verbose (so &quot;start position&quot; rather than &quot;startp&quot;). Also, when you get into the implementation, it is kind of tiring to think about what every local variable should mean, so maybe this only really works for procedural parameters and maybe to help define fields.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about this for awhile, but haven&#x27;t put it into a prototype yet.",1423793823

It is probably the first winter that I have consistently enjoyed ;-)  Every year it gets better as I learn what to do and what not to do.  My mother in law has several forms of heat in her house but absolutely refuses to turn it on.  For a few years I was quite worried about her, but I&#x27;ve since realized that she just likes winter.  It is massive culture shock at the beginning, though.<p>Being uncomfortable seems like something you should avoid.  I think this is the general culture of the west.  However, as I have adapted to this way of living I&#x27;ve come to realize that there are 2 kinds of discomfort -- discomfort that injures you and discomfort that doesn&#x27;t injure you.  You can ignore the latter.<p>Perhaps the easiest way I can explain it is through food.  Many people <i>love</i> spicy food.  The spicier the better.  But it hurts!  Why would you do that to yourself?  Similarly, in the US (and spreading fairly rapidly), incredibly bitter beers are getting quite popular.  Some of the highest rated beers are actually hitting the threshold of bitterness that we can taste.  The reason people like these spicy and bitter foods is because along with the pain comes an amazing flavour.  If you could have the flavour without the pain, it wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as nice because it would be cloying.<p>This is also true of cold winters and hot summers.  I admit that my capacity to enjoy 30+ degree weather with 80-90 percent humidity far exceeds my capacity to enjoy 5 degree weather with wind, but both are increasing each year.<p>If you would like to try this, I don&#x27;t think there is any particular need to turn off your heat every day through the winter.  On a day that you feel strong, accept that you will be miserable and turn off the heat.  Then spend the day trying to find good things (you have to try a hot water bottle!!!).  You will probably hate it, but you may surprise yourself that you discover some very nice things.  Just like getting used to hot food, you can try it occasionally and perhaps even start to enjoy it.",1423792856

The red-shift they&#x27;re talking about is not from the initial difference in velocity, it&#x27;s from the wave length being stretched by the expansion of space as the light travels.<p>For example, the wikipedia article about the accelerating expansion [1] mentions things like:<p>> the distance-redshift relation deviates from linearity, and this deviation depends on how the expansion rate has changed over time<p>If the universe decided to suddenly increase in size by 1% over the next hour, all the already-travelling light would arrive with a 1% larger wavelength. If it had suddenly increased in size by 1% a billion years ago, the already-travelling light would get just that 1% larger wavelength but also 1% more travel time for stretching out to occur over.

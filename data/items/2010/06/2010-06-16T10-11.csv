I didn't want to get into it and get off topic but maybe i shouldn't have worded it like that.<p>I think the main reason this isn't pc vs Mac now is that with pcs the hardware plays a much smaller role in the user experience than with phones.  Windows could present a more unified front on lots of different hardware than the current phone ecosystem can. Also in the early days of the windows vs Mac battle compatibility and workplace computers played a much bigger role in the choice.  Those factors let windows get a very solid mind-share foothold even if the underlying ecosystem was just as fragmented.",1276685778

1435199,comment,1434944,1434944,0,0,zmmmmm,,,"The most interesting thing about all this is simply how personally Jobs and Gruber both seem to have taken the competition from Google.   They genuinely seem to feel enormously betrayed by it.  What this tells me is that both of them are now starting to acknowledge internally that Android really is an enormous threat to the iPhone and it is so in ways that they simply can't compete with.  Google is putting out an operating system that is nearly as good as Apple's, runs on any hardware that anyone wants it to and is completely free.   Apple can't hurt Google by undermining it profits because it doesn't make the hardware and it gives the software away.   It really seems like an unfair fight.  But what I think really hurts is Google invalidates Apple's core thesis, that control, power and lockdown are necessary for a consumer friendly operating system. Right as Apple is trying to justify not including Flash by saying it can't work properly on phones, Google is there adding it into Android and making them look like fools.<p>Incidentally Gruber seems to be conveniently overlooking a lot of history here.  Hostilities really started when <i>Apple</i> banned Google Voice from the iPhone.  Prior to that things were pretty friendly, but after that Google realized it couldn't afford to play friendly with Apple - so they enabled multitouch in Android and things went downhill from there.   Although it's a completely pointless and silly game to play if you really follow it back I think there is a very good argument that Apple started this whole falling out.",1276685399

Why would they NOT do it? Apple does not control smartphone market - they control iPhone market, a subset of smartphone market. They have made the product, the supporting infrastructure for it, how are they obliged to allow competition in there?<p>For example, some time ago I bought a Canon printer. There was a booklet packed with it, telling me what inks can be used with it - all were of Canon brand. Now, I know there are some third parties selling inks for Canon printers, and without a doubt they would like to be featured in those booklets, preferably with the notice that their ink is of comparable quality while costing far less. But Canon is not including them - is that a dick move too?<p>Yes, you can happily use X ink in your Canon printer. And you can run X adds in your iPhone apps. But those inks would not be sold in Canon stores. And the same way, Apple can choose not to distribute those apps in their Appstore.<p>Last time I checked, neither iPhone platform, nor Appstore were public domain :)",1276684495

That Apple merely took the gloves off and started taking the fight more seriously. But aggrieved sentiment is written all over Steve Jobs's reaction to Android.<p>'They want to kill the iPhone' -- remember that little gem? How did he know this? Because Android-based products were looking more and more like iPhones. But the reason for the convergent evolution of the two platforms is quite obvious: it's a winning design. It's a ridiculous justification for preemptive retaliation, on par with 'Saddam tried to kill my daddy'.<p>The reason Google decided to get involved in smartphones is the same reason Apple did: the internet. Before the current sheer-slab-of-touchscreen became the recognised form-factor of an internet-friendly phone, we waited years and years for Nokia, SE and Motorola and crucially, the carriers, to give us a device that could freely access the services and content that we knew were all around us. What did we get? Push email. The pressure was building and by 2005 the industry was ripe for disruption.<p>Apple's prestige, combined with the exclusive AT&T deal, was what forced the carriers to abandon their walled-garden ideal and take the internet seriously. The iPhone was an offer they couldn't refuse. Google could not have done that. The problem is that having freed us from the carriers' walled gardens, Apple now wants to take their place.<p>I think Jobs was being just a little disingenuous when he said Google wants to kill the iPhone. What he could have more honestly and accurately said is that Google wants to kill the iPhone OS's chance of achieving a monopoly position. Why do they want that? For the same reason they got into smartphone design: the internet.",1276684136

They already have the right people teaching. We need to fire many of the people who are currently teaching.<p>If you want to fire a big chunk of your teachers, that's fine.  You just need to ensure the people you are replacing them with are better, and you do that by having higher requirements, paying them more, and giving them a better environment to work in.  That means smaller classes, more autonomy, not relying on standardized tests for compensation, and a whole host of other things the US fails at.<p>Let's say you had a big tech company with thousands of mediocre programmers.  You want to fire them and hire better ones, but before you do that you have to ask why you had so many lousy programmers in the first place.  Why did good programmers decide not to work for your company, and how will you both attract them and convince them to stay?  The US seems to think it can get highly qualified teachers by providing working environments akin to code monkey cubicle farms, and they're simply wrong.",1318744513

3116608,comment,3115577,3116353,7,0,jrockway,,,"There is some bookkeeping involved when you want IO watchers and timers, but it amounts to a heap for the timers (""when does the next timer go off?""), calling select with the timeout set for when the next timer expires, and then updating the timer queue when you wake up (if it's because the timer time arrived, rather than because IO is possible).  That's basically why we have event loop libraries, to tie those two data structures together.<p>The critical thing to learn about epoll is event-triggering and level-triggering.  I've seen people write libev code where they make watchers for r and w on a socket, then keep those alive regardless of whether or not they have data to write.  This means their process never goes to sleep, since the fd is always writable and the write callback is called every time the process tries to go to sleep.  They are expecting edge-triggering when ev provides level-triggering.<p>On the other hand, I've seen people using libzmq with libev have the opposite problem.  libev's watchers are level-triggered, but libzmq's ZMQ_FDs are edge-triggered.  This means you really have to know what you're doing to get things to work (but if you treat the ZMQ_FD like you <i>should</i> treat a normal fd, that is, read until EWOULDBLOCK and write until EWOULDBLOCK, it works), and reading an article that discusses how both work could be helpful in getting you to write correct code.  OTOH, the terms themselves <i>are</i> pretty clear.",1318742194

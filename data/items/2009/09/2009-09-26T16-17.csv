The truth isn't something that can be voted on. Does God exist because more people believe in Him than believe in a secular universe?<p><i>The use of pejorative language obscures your content. Like ""fuck that"".</i><p>""Fuck that"" obscures nothing. It's a concise way to say what I wanted to say. I could have said ""I disagree"", which takes twice as long to say and sounds garbled. I think there's a place for the word ""fuck"": It's for saying something very clearly and quickly when there's no need for delay. So, ""Fuck that"" doesn't have connotations. Not in the way that ""That's shit"" does, or even ""Fuck you"".<p><i>Finally: negative scores on a story are still shown... not numerally, but by how gray it is. Thus, the current experiment does not apply to comments with negative scores. I think it would be worthwhile extending it to include those, at least for -1 or -2 comments (for example, by not graying them out til they hit -3).</i><p>I agree completely. As an aside, it's interesting right now watching my comments just in this thread. Once they hit 0 and turn grey, there's a lot of turbulence and they hover around there until they go black again, but the comments here that are in the black have quite high scores. That reinforces my belief that reading a grey comment biases you to think it's a bad comment. So in my mind, the threshold now where a single voter can grey a comment is too low. Setting it to -2 means there'd have to be a three-vote discrepancy between ups and downs, which I think sounds about right.",1253983920

845684,comment,843986,844851,0,0,thwarted,,,"That's an interesting interpretation of what really amounts to a position statement on software licensing, a position that I'm sure most of all already accept and live by.  The base android code is open source.  Google has not open sourced the apps they provide that integrate with their other service offerings.  These apps are proprietary.  Any carrier or handset maker is able to use the android platform, which is open source.  I think it's reasonable to allow, and expect, the same entity, be it individual developers or companies, to provide software under multiple licenses.  Proprietary software is available for open source operating systems run on desktop computers, and Android helps enable that same software ecosystem on cellphones also.  This hardly seems like a reason to NOT get an Android phone, but rather the reason to get one.<p>No one expects any app developer to open source their app just because it is sold or available in the Android Market.  And app developers are welcome to get a carrier or include their app as part of a base install, which is effectively what Google has done as part of being an app developer.  If the carrier pays the developer for that, or the developer pays the carrier for that, or if money doesn't change hands for that, maybe the developer just wants increased exposure and usage of their app that would come from it being in a default install, that's between those two parties.<p>EDIT to add:<p>It's unfortunate that Google is saying that they license their apps to distributors.  What would it take for ROM creators to become licencors?  Alternatively, since Google presumably has an interest in people actually using their apps, that they don't provide a way for users who are using a properly licensed phone/ROM who are using those apps to be installed other than through the base install seems kind of shortsighted.  Some of their apps are available in the market (like the Finance, My Maps Editor, there was an update to the core Maps app that you installed from the Market), but an alternative of allowing the people who should be able to use the apps, because they've purchased a phone with a ROM that is licensed to, update them seems necessary and right.",1253983766

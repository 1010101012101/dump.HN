You can add advertising (like what many sites do these days), you can start charging for 'premium' features (the so-called freemium business model), or you can start requesting donations (wikipedia model). <p>Each of these different montization methods has its own pros and cons and each of them has a potential to piss of users and alienate them.<p>So the question that I have is: what is the best time to implement one of these features? Do you start charging/advertising from the beginning or do you wait for the community to grow on the completely free model?",1193627754

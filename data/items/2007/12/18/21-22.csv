Probably not all places will be safer enough to hold a nuclear reactor, so probably the traditional grid will be still necessary... Think of it like a distributed power plant with a grid which still needs maintenance.",1198014559

The management dashboard checks a data base and includes a warning message if the process hasn't run in the past hour. Since ""someone"" checks the dashboard every 5 minutes or so anyway, action can be taken to restart the background process.<p>But what if, for some reason, no one checks the management dashboard for hours?  I was recently asked if there was a better way.  ""You have 2 options, either (a) upgrade to Unix and reboot once a year whether you need to or not, or (b) run a background process to see if the background process is still running.""  We're not spending any money on (a), so I guess it's (b).<p>Now I need a PHB dashboard for ""someone"" to check every 5 minutes to see if the background process that checks the background process is still running.",1198013436

Popularity is not everything.<p>(It's also worth noting that Objective-C itself may well be as popular, or more so, than most of those same languages.

So great, because capitalism has absorbed artistic practice in some way into its structure, now artistic practice is capitalistic.<p>This makes little sense. It&#x27;s funny to see that capitalist aping of artistic practice is now being regarded as a new era in artistic practice by this guy though.<p>Art has had a fascinating relationship to capital well before capitalism, but to confuse its continuing ability to survive with some kind of fundamental transformation of the practice is kinda silly.<p>Yes, okay: what is art?<p>The answer isn&#x27;t: commerce. No need to go so far back, but just look to cave paintings to discover that these ideas of economy and capital are only sidelines and contextual footnotes to the practice of art.",1420340371

      freeze after anywhere from 5-60 minutes. Only a hard 
      reboot would make them responsive.
    * smart mailboxes no longer live update for me. I just 
      have to trut that the messages I&#x27;ve deleted or moved 
      will be gone when I manually reload the mailbox.
    * replying to calendar events in Mail no longer provides 
      any indication that some action has been performed. 
      (Maybe this is related to the smart mailbox issue 
      above).
    * Calendar will just stop drawing every once in a while 
      requiring a restart.
    * Calendar frequently barfs on event updates and requires 
      reverting to the server version for any hope of 
      reconciling the changes.
    * Safari frequently consumes all memory and all CPU for 
      lighter workloads than I used to run (because I know it 
      will go out of control at somepoint).
    * The background of the login screen frequently has 
      graphical glitches which are likely caused by 
      overwriting areas of graphic or texture memory (this 
      seems to happen on Intel or dedicated graphics cards)
    * iPhoto forced a database update, crashed in the middle 
      of the migration, and corrupted a decade old library.  
      This happened immediately after time machine told me 
      that it needed to start a new a backup and deleted my 
      most recent good backup.

Before that, you&#x27;re just ketogenic.<p>Everything I read, and my personal experience, leads me to believe that the only muscle that breaks down is that which is not used (which is compatible with your general description). As long as you keep exercising during the fasting days, there&#x27;s no reason to resupply your glycogen stores. After about two days, your body will switch to ketones as a fuel source, which will likely alter your body odour and -- if you are not used to it, e.g. the first time you do it, is likely to give you headaches and other flu like symptoms for a couple of days.

They both talk about fasting leading to a depletion of white blood cells, triggering &quot;stem cell-based regeneration&quot; of new immune cells and how this may prove useful when treating cancer patients.<p>The main difference in the two is that the press release does not use the word &#x27;entire&#x27; in its headline and the regeneration aspect was only specified for mice. But, and this is important, the press release does not make particularly clear whether the regenerative aspect was also looked for in humans (was it? the quote makes it seem so). I do not blame the likely time starved writer for not bothering with nuance if the press release itself doesn&#x27;t take the time to be clear. The news article is also better for its attempt at sampling more skeptical views, most &#x27;reporting&#x27; does not go that far.<p>A lot of (most?) science reporting is just regurgitating press releases, if science reporting is poor then press releases can explain the bulk of that shoddy reporting.

I avoided WordPress because I don&#x27;t need plugins or pain of setup, etc. and I wanted to host the blog myself.<p>I used Octopress before and was seriously considering it.  The problem I had with Octopress (and by relation Jekyll) was the effort to create or edit posts. I had Octopress files locally and would publish via sftp to my server. It just felt clunky and became a barrier.<p>I chose Ghost for my blog and the authoring process is awesome compared to Octopress.  Ghost uses Markdown and has a live preview. I can create posts anywhere via authoring on a tablet. Since I&#x27;m hosting it myself I feel like I can put other things on my server if I need to (like D3.js, etc.)<p>Now I&#x27;m no expert on blogging but I do like using Ghost over the past month or so.

It&#x27;s not like decades of DNA mutations are going away.<p>I&#x27;ve done fasts on relatively nothing for over five days.  Early on, you get some &quot;empty-stomach intelligence&quot; where your mind is just more alert because of plenty of oxygen (from not digesting) and probably some evolution that favored apes that got observant and driven when hungry as opposed to lazy.<p>Fasting long enough to get the effects in the paper will use up all your glycogen stocks.  Read wiki on starvation for details, but basically you want to have a small supply of starches to keep your skeletal muscle from breaking down to feed your brain.  About two days in, without some glucose supply, you will unavoidably slow down.  Lethargy will commence when your brain is starving.  It is not euphoric.  It is the world slipping out of grip without you noticing.<p>As long as your taking care of your mandatory glucose supply, fasting over three days or more will lead to a common theme in all nutrition and health papers:  all processes that break things down for re-use are up-regulated and all processes that consume resources are down-regulated.<p>It&#x27;s not difficult to propose that a system composed of mostly brand-new, turned over cells and muscles with all their proteins aligned to the principle stresses is more protein efficient than one resulting from plenty of nutrients floating around like entrepreneurs with too much money.  Fasting would be expected to result in general house-cleaning so that protein that&#x27;s not accomplishing much ends up reallocated to doing something useful.<p>Some examples of where this shows up in scientific papers is the increased sensitivity to chemotherapy of cancer cells when the patient is fasting.  One proposed mechanism was an up-regulation of registration for immune-system induced self-destruction through the normal pathway; a badly functioning protein might go ahead and function sufficiently in the up-regulated pathway.<p>More obvious benefits from fasting are the same as those of anything where you build up self-discipline and also getting in touch with the difference between hunger and a lack of being full; they are much more distinct after a fast.  Cravings for sugar are gone because your hormones for hunger and satiety are all operating properly, as is your pancreas.<p>My favorite way to get empty is to just drink water and/or coffee (black) or tea.  Fluids, no macro-nutrients.  Get some glucose from some bread.  Get some micro-nutrients from some yogurt and rabbit food.  Let the rest slip into the starvation mode.  Stress level and blood pressure will decline into a kind of euphoria as long as you don&#x27;t over-do the calorie starving to the point that you&#x27;re thinking on muscle protein.<p>I&#x27;ve done it.  All the mechanisms have obvious symptoms.  If you are just ketogenic and in starvation, you feel euphoric and completely without variations in energy.  If you are beyond starvation and skeletal protein is being converted to glucose, you piss dark yellow and feel like you&#x27;re on anesthetic.  Either way you lose a lot of weight, your energy will regulate much more tightly, and you won&#x27;t be bothered by hunger, and you&#x27;ll be drinking coffee as nature intended it instead of some holiday special milk-shake.<p>It&#x27;s well-established that reduced calorie diets promote longevity and that the spectrum of metabolic syndrome conditions are associated with all sorts of bad things, so although I&#x27;m not a doctor, I don&#x27;t expect to have any regret about recommending anyone try coffee fasting to put their system through its paces.",1420337654

There aren&#x27;t (afaik) any limit to how many there are. I&#x27;ve had a few (internships, full time job in Seattle).<p>So what is the average experience for a Canadian or Mexican on TN visas to the US? I&#x27;ve been one, and I&#x27;ve known quite a few. Purely anecdotal, but as far as I can tell, we&#x27;re just an increase in the usual supply of developers, which eventually just lowers the average wage of all developers.

There is no perfectly objective voting scheme that would let us avoid this.

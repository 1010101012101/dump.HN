A lot of security scenarios are compromised if you can accurately deliver a small amount of payload from the air into an arbitrary space.<p>I think the FAA would do well to allow property owners, or their designated agents, a free hand to do what ever they want to drones over their property at altitudes below 400&#x27;.

While IPv4 was designed around the (then) new 32 bit processors of the day, the committee that came up with v6 decided to ignore the underlying hardware reality. There&#x27;s no corresponding type in C (or the underlying hardware, without going into SSE) that can store a v6 address natively. It just acts as a handbrake and makes it that much harder to implement. The question should be turned around, why didn&#x27;t they design a protocol that could fit into a built-in type in C? After all, we&#x27;ve only just &quot;run out&quot; of v4 addresses about 20 years after it was first predicted to happen. Going to 64 bit would have kicked the can another few decades down the road, and could have led to a much faster implementation. You can&#x27;t blame the &quot;designers&quot; of C (since there aren&#x27;t any really, it&#x27;s just the CPU manufacturers), it&#x27;s the IETF that ignored the reality of hardware and programming languages.",1444164846
10342304,comment,10340386,10342080,0,0,skilesare,,,"> Except it&#x27;s not hoarded, it&#x27;s reinvested. The consumption of created value is deferred while accruing interest at a market rate. This interest rate is an important signal to the greater economy weather to start long-term projects now or later. If interest rates are too high, big projects will be financed later while simultaneously incentivizing value producers to defer consumption. To me this is the best regulator for why you don&#x27;t &quot;drink the bottle of water all at one time&quot;.<p>Re hoarding:  Some is reinvested.  Much is consumed along the way in management fees, reserve requirements, and financial institution profits.  It is not optimal. The middle men will be eliminated eventually.<p>Re Interest Rate:  The rate is an important signal for bank profits too.  Essential to them in fact.  There are other signals.  And deferring a big project to later may be fine if you are building a high rise in downtown, but delay can be deadly if you&#x27;re trying to reduce pollution, cure cancer, map a genome, ect.<p>> Money is a naturally occurring phenomena amongst rational actors. Any highly marketable commodity that can be expected to be traded at a later date can act as a form of money - for example, cigarettes in prison. I can&#x27;t imagine someone wanting their cigarettes to be prone to dissolving.<p>Have you ever smoked a 5 year old cigarette?  As for other examples, you can make a bet that oil will be $50 in 5 years, many do, and many lose their shirts(and some make a killing). Volatility rules.<p>>I personally wonder if we can trade without money at all. For example, trading digital certificates that represent real-world assets (stocks, commodities). Prices can be denominated in any asset, and payments go thru a clearing house that matches and settles trades in real time. This would let me go to Subway and buy a sandwhich denominated in Apple stock that I payed for with shares of crude oil stock.<p>It is certainly possible...but stock has its own issues.  It is a form of hybrid capital and subject to all kinds of accounting shenanigans.",1444164842

If the 2008 one, it had a lot more to do with the financial side than the actual real-estate side, so changes in the real-estate sales process aren&#x27;t likely to fix that problem. The &quot;primary&quot; dollar value involved in housing-price declines was significant but not really enough to cause an economy-destabilizing financial crisis. But the primary price declines in actual real-estate were multiplied many times over because the mortgages were all piled into heavily leveraged securities, priced based on risk models that turned out to be very inaccurate. That caused a crisis that ultimately involved dollar amounts greater than the total value of all the involved real estate.<p>A loose analogy: if you buy stock with 100:1 leverage, and the stock price declines 10%, you lose 1000% of your original investment.

I think it&#x27;s a disconnect between what users and developers think the product is, and the lack of support contracts or policies in app markets. When a potential buyer is evaluating the value of an app they&#x27;re going to consider how long the app will likely be supported, updated, and fixed. Since the current trend with most apps is a practically indefinite support cycle people evaluate the value of an app with that assumption in mind.

It&#x27;s not talking about affine type systems and Hindley-Milner type inference. It&#x27;s talking about management research masquerading as research on how to engineer software. And that&#x27;s a fraud.&quot;<p>I totally agree with you there. I think a lot of the dispute in my post and yours centers on the definition of software engineering. You&#x27;re applying it as the approach strictly about process, paperwork, drowning in numbers, etc with nothing produced. I&#x27;m applying it to mean any software development activities that apply engineering principles to software with engineering-like results. Computer Science is where a lot of what I&#x27;m citing came from, although CompSci != engineering software in general case. So, I have to have another term and &quot;software engineer&quot; literally means a person that engineers software.<p>Think I need a solution to this problem as it&#x27;s recurring. I&#x27;ve clearly illustrated most programmers, even good ones, don&#x27;t apply engineering fully and leverage what&#x27;s proven. It&#x27;s always a subset, if at all, often with informal approach driving the whole thing. There are groups doing the whole thing like engineering but they&#x27;re rare & not paperwork pushers. If the phrase is irreparably tarnished, I might need to ditch &quot;software engineer&quot; for a phrase that describes the difference between how a group like Praxis does things and how a decent programming shop does it. The difference is how systematic it&#x27;s designed, assured, and documented with every available, proven method put to use plus careful tradeoffs. Need a new terms I&#x27;m thinking because old one caused a huge chunk of your counter-points which apply to the crowd we both can&#x27;t stand but not really the niche I&#x27;m promoting.<p>&quot;Hardware has been able to take advantage of formal methods for much longer than software, because hardware has never been more than a thousandth as complex as software since at least the 1950s.&quot;<p>Partly and often developers are reason. Getting from hand-wired hardware to synthesis, formal methods, simulation, and testing took hundreds of millions in investment with many bright minds. The reason it worked was they noticed common patterns in their designs/implementations, started reusing them in new ones, built verification techniques for them, focused heavily on integration/reuse, and just went from there. Cleanroom was one of many methods that did something similar (but semi-formal) for software in structuring, verification, and integration. Formal verification teams did it again in so many isolated cases covering so many properties and types of software. The Cleanroom, FV, and model-based synthesis results show software development could get as much verification as hardware for sure. Just would take a sizeable labor investment in tooling and libraries plus agreement to simplify implementation and interfaces to facilitate analysis. Not saying that will mainstream but it&#x27;s achievable and can be incremental. At least we&#x27;re getting type systems and tooling, though, from the niche (esp CompSci) that cares about the stuff.<p>&quot;btw, you misspelled &quot;Harlan&quot; as &quot;Harlin&quot;; the poor guy deserves better&quot;<p>Damn haha. He really does. Yes, Harlan&#x27;s methods could be improved. No argument here. An example was how the graph-based models were doing better than hierarchical. Another is executing your code to test assumptions on its dependencies. Point about Cleanroom was that it worked, its style/results were much like engineering, demonstrated many good practices, had empirical evidence backing it, and was a logical starting point that was entirely ignored by developers. And it wasn&#x27;t the only one.<p>Far as FSM&#x27;s: you nailed that one. Almost all high assurance systems used an Interacting State Machine model where FSM primitives were analysed and composed functionally (often CSP style). It was the only proven model in terms of getting results that survived all analysis and pen testing. You can do rigorous formal verification but that&#x27;s high assurance: something you and other readers reject automatically in these discussions. So, I left that off.<p>Plenty of research & products working on different models but they&#x27;re still getting proven out over time. Gotta use what&#x27;s proven for now if I want get the best results.<p>&quot;Formal verification comes from logicians and computer scientists&quot;<p>All true and good examples: I listed some in another comment. Then they or the engineers I refer to put them into practice. Most developers don&#x27;t. Still need a term for the former that won&#x27;t tie into the other crowd you&#x27;ve been describing that stole and tarnished the phrase.",1444164466

Media consumption takes up a <i>huge</i> part of that. And while an individual&#x27;s level of media consumption may rise or fall, it&#x27;s relatively consistent across a large number of people.<p>I have a hunch the author is stumbling onto the problem of media <i>measurement</i>. Basically, as more forms of media are available, we tend to consume more of them at the same time. For example, in the 80s I may have watched TV while reading the newspaper. As we have added more types of media in the form of mobile, video and games, we just add more potential &quot;double counting&quot; (or even triple counting!) scenarios. Also, many of these usage measures tend to be self-reported; and the more dimensions you have in a self-reporting questionnaire the less accurate the results are likely to be when you add them up (rounding error, poor recall of actual times leading to &quot;proportional&quot; times, etc).<p>Media measurement is hard. We still haven&#x27;t figured it out for online advertising, which should arguably be easier than other types of media since we have better mechanisms for measuring things automatically.<p>Things are moving towards the long tail though, so I do expect to see a continued growth in the variety of media available. But if you want to see a &quot;zero sum&quot; media in action, just consider that the average ratings for &quot;Seinfeld&quot; were 21 million viewers per episode. 20 years later, the most popular show on TV was &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; with an average of only 13 million viewers. TV ratings have actually been on a steady decline since the 1950s [1]. So if you give people more options, they will watch them -- at the expense of other forms of media.

Obviously the latter, because we know that there are big differences between people which must be measured if we want to make reliable predictions about the effect of the drug in the rest of the population, while additional blood pressure measurements of a person only reduces variability a little bit and helps only a little (because most of the sampling error was removed by the first pair of measurements, and further measurements leave the bulk of variance unaffected).",1444164226

How can you criticize him for not agreeing with a particular normative judgement? This is not an intellectual or positive failure, it is a normative difference. Moreover, even if this criticism was valid, your assertion that &quot;[w]hen money holds value, it is hoarded&quot;, is probably true (though you use the pejorative term hoard which puts your objectivity into question); however devaluing currencies forces people to &#x27;hoard&#x27; real estate and other physical stores of value, which are actually productive (as opposed to paper or plastic specie which are not very useful).<p>Good points!  I need to lay off the exaggerated vocab.  I think that land is a special case.  Most other things and actually most land these days, do require up keep.  This upkeep is usually provided by the bottom level of society as those with enough resources to &#x27;hoard&#x27; are usually not the ones cutting the grass.  Most things have a built in decay.  Gessell proposed a special system for land that isn&#x27;t really in line with my views on property rights, but clearly something needs to be in place to avoid unproductive land accumulation.  Property taxes work pretty well for this.<p>One&#x27;s actual ability to predict the value of other &#x27;physical stores of value&#x27; well enough to actually use them as stores of value over long periods of time is probably over estimated.<p>>Why not? Apart from this analogy making little sense, there is no reason to believe that one should not spend all one&#x27;s money in a single &#x27;binge&#x27; as opposed to rationing spending.<p>Of course you can spend it all at one time, but generally, the thing you are spending it on did not pop into being at that instant, in the condition of maximum value.  I guess my point is that if we are going to use money as a metaphor for exchanging goods and services, it should be a good metaphor.  Goods and services degrade over time. Money should too.<p>>Again, there is no particular reason to believe this. You seem to be asserting things as true with no reasoning to support your beliefs.<p>Hey! I&#x27;m making the metaphors here. :)  Yes, this is a though exercise.  Play them out to their conclusions.

Here is another way to think of things....If I produce a unit of work today...and I want to convert it to cash.  How long into the future should that unit of work be good for?  I don&#x27;t know that there is a right answer.  I think the line moves as society changes, but I think there is a line.  If I stick that money in the bank, even at 0 interest, in an Ideal Money world with 0 inflation, and live off the state for the next 50 years, should I be able to take it out and buy the same amount of goods with it?  Is that the society we want?  We get to decide the society we want to live in...It is all about aligning incentives.<p>?This doesn&#x27;t make any sense at all. If you were to say that fields being left fallow, machines being unused, or books left on the shelf was a waste of potential utility, you would likely be correct, but small pieces of paper and metal are not of much use to anyone, and not spending them simply increases the value of the money that is trading hands.<p>Tell that to the socially awkward scientist who has a risky, but ultimately valid cure for cancer in his head, but can&#x27;t get financing to save his(or your) life.

All open jobs: <a href=""https://www.stitchfix.com/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.stitchfix.com/careers</a>)<p>We&#x27;re solving some REALLY interesting problems. I just joined as Principal Engineer and I&#x27;m loving it. The business is an advanced algorithms & machine learning recommendation engine applied to a Women&#x27;s Fashion e-commerce / subscription service. In english, we send our clients an outfit every few weeks, our algorithm and our stylists choose the perfect outfit for our customers, and they LOVE it. Just search instagram for hashtag &quot;#stitchfix&quot; and see how many of our customers post happy pictures of themselves receiving this month&#x27;s &quot;Fix&#x27;. Our customer referral to friend statistic is off the charts.<p>On the business side, it&#x27;s a startup but we&#x27;re profitable and we&#x27;re not planning on seeking additional funding. Its amazing to be part of a company that is experiencing so much growth and success.<p>On the Engineering side, we&#x27;re solving some really interesting problems. The Principal Engineer role which I just started is a very interesting type of position. We do not have Product Managers, and Principal Engineers are responsible for a part of the business (I&#x27;m responsible for part of the consumer facing web site). They are responsible for driving the product forward, working with all the stakeholders and then also implementing the solutions. When people hear this sometimes they ask &quot;so what the engineers just sit around and invent features?&quot;...well its not like that. What Product Managers do is talk to all the business stakeholders, customers, consult the A/B testing results, take UX design input into account and then try to put that all together. Of course there is still one key business stakeholder that makes the high level calls, but there is a lot of Product Management type work that happens between that decision that typically falls on a product manager and here it falls on the Principal engineer.<p>There is an entire separate department we call AA (Algorithms and Analytics) They are working on really advanced machine learning recommendation algorithm and with every little improvement of the algorithm they can see real impact of increased sales and increase customer satisfaction.<p>Don&#x27;t let the industry (Womens Fashion) put you off. The smartest, most driven but nicest people work here and you&#x27;ll be doing yourself a disservice if you don&#x27;t at least consider it. The engineers I&#x27;m working with really care about the craft of Software Engineering and this is a great environment for anyone that feels the same.<p>Check out our engineering and algorithms web site: <a href=""http://technology.stitchfix.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://technology.stitchfix.com/</a> and here is our jobs page <a href=""https://www.stitchfix.com/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.stitchfix.com/careers</a>.<p>To reach the hiring managers and recruiting team directly, email tech-jobs (at) stitchfix (dot) com (its not a black hole - it actually goes to the right people.)<p><pre><code>                            ,---.

Etc.<p>There are other schemes which seem permissible (e.g. a group of people agree to buy a house, then they find a renter and split up the rent between them.

This interest rate is an important signal to the greater economy weather to start long-term projects now or later.

I expanded my thoughts on the concept in that comment, but as to wordpress:<p>I bet reddit is just getting crushed with improvements and the engineering team is overworked. It is really easy and inexpensive to test this concept out without losing developer bandwith. wordpress provides a pretty good CMS (obviously bloated, [standard other wordpress criticsims], etc.) but they can get a tight feedback cycle on this idea and it could successful, but if not, will not be resource intensive.<p>I generally wish them the best of luck, they need something to work at a monetization level, and I hope this helps as it likely is not the long term solution.<p>I had a rough first experience with wordpress for a client recently and I just had to vent.",1444162617

If you sell 3 month US Treasuries that you do not have because you think that you are going to be able to buy them later at a lower price, you may have to buy them at 0% if they are called. Second, there are a number of funds that have constrained investment choice. For example, Fidelity has a short term US Treasury fund that must only invest in short term US Treasuries. And, many pension funds and government funds must invest at least a portion of their holdings in a limited set of debt holdings (sometime even further limited by credit rating or in fact by name). Finally, US Treasures can be used as collateral or for hedging as part of certain contracts and/or swap agreements.",1444162591

Like other assurance activities, Extreme Programming just did what was already done, gave it a new name, mixed it with bullshit (esp pair programming), and got it some needed attention.

That&#x27;s on top of specifications, covert channel analysis, pen testing, using only proven components, build system automation, etc that far exceed XP&#x27;s quality regiment.<p>Funny you mention Cleanroom because it was first thing I thought of when I heard the &quot;new&quot; Agile approach. Iterative development, code reviews, usage-based testing for acceptance, verifying each module... Cleanroom had all that. At least they eventually figured it out and it seems competitors in Agile identified XP&#x27;s problems as well.

It is a great website in a very difficult situation due to the community culture (<i>very</i> anti-corporate/advertising mentality), diversity of users and content ownership issues. On a real level, the site is pretty awesome. I want to see them succeed because sub-communities and even the organization have stood for an opened internet and positive things.<p>I think upvoted looks really sleek and I hope it is successful, but they really need a way to monetize and it is a really hard problem to solve. Obviously, using a widely supported mature CMS like wordpress makes it easy to
produce content with minimal effort and cost but that has been reddit users largest gripe. Upvoted is a curator/aggregator built on top of a curator/aggregator, which is weird. Reddit&#x27;s success and problems stem from providing the long tail of content, allowing diverse topics and communities to be covered while allowing globally popular things to float to the top. This means that there is rarely community consensus, so while upvoted has little risk as it is cheap to make, I can&#x27;t see it providing much financial support for the company.<p>In all honesty though, I wish them the best of luck and hope to see them do cool and intersting things in the future. Obviously, improving the search would be a great start because Google is an awesome search engine, but for content discovery and curation, Reddit is doing a great job.
Best of luck guys and sorry about the sarcastic comments about Wordpress and PHP, it really is a good way to quickly test out something like upvoted without significant dev reources and is a good content management system, edit: [if used correctly]",1444162463

I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re referring to about the search space, but the detail isn&#x27;t important - what you say here is not the case.  When dealing with NPC problems, the instances form a landscape that&#x27;s not like rolling hills, but like a mesa with wells and flagpoles.  Most of the time you wander around, broadly speaking at the same level, and then you might, if you&#x27;re unbelievably lucky, fall down a well, or find a flagpole to climb.  But this becomes implausibly difficult as the sizes get properly big.<p>Sampling the space just doesn&#x27;t work.<p><pre><code>  > I do not know if iteratively sampling integers

Doesn&#x27;t work.  Our intuition tends to be drawn from our experience in three dimensions, but it just doesn&#x27;t work in higher dimensions.

I don&#x27;t think that makes sense, so obviously I&#x27;ve missed something.  I don&#x27;t understand what you mean by a &quot;P=NP exploiting solver&quot;.

This doesn&#x27;t make sense to me either.  In a proof one shows that the time taken is always less than some limit, regardless of the input.  One doesn&#x27;t talk about having a running-time limit - that seems irrelevant to the entire question.<p>If you send me an email I&#x27;ll point you at my post when I write it and before I publish it, so you can comment.",1444161968

How can you criticize him for not agreeing with a particular normative judgement?  This is not an intellectual or positive failure, it is a normative difference.  Moreover, even if this criticism was valid, your assertion that &quot;[w]hen money holds value, it is hoarded&quot;, is probably true (though you use the pejorative term hoard which puts your objectivity into question); however devaluing currencies forces people to &#x27;hoard&#x27; real estate and other physical stores of value, which are actually productive (as opposed to paper or plastic specie which are not very useful).<p>><i>Money can be used as a measure of potential utility, but you can&#x27;t just open it like a bottle of water and drink it all at one time.</i><p>Why not?

The offer process itself is also quite simple and can be done online. That said, the one benefit of an open house/tour hosted by a neutral party, is that it lets potential buyers easily assess a house without having a biased seller in attendance. This can also be managed and does not really require a real estate agent. Zillow and similar services like Trulia have a fantastic market opportunity in front of them.",1444161648

People in power always say the militants were too militant and actually hurt the cause - whether it&#x27;s true or not.<p>When you think about it, the only thing the establishment wants is an opposition too weak to effectively stop them. Winning movements almost always have a radical edge. You mentioned Malcolm X, but even Martin Luther King was accused of hurting the cause for black equality by being too extreme.<p>And even if all the militant suffragettes did was make the mainstream suffrage movement look more acceptable, that&#x27;s still a huge impact for a numerically small group.",1444161626

It's actually quite life changing. Last year through blood tests and biopsy I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease. That basically means my immune system attacks my intestines if I eat anything with gluten in it. Even a microscopic amount of gluten is too much, so kitchen contamination is a big problem and if people don't understand it, I will probably get contaminated food.<p>There are 2 iPhone apps that I don't know how I could live without:<p>1. ""Find Me Gluten Free"" - Shows me restaurants that are gluten aware. This allows me to eat out without the fear of hidden gluten in my food. I'm sure there are similar apps for every common allergy, such as peanuts.<p>2. ""Gluten Free Ingredients"" - Has a catalog of ingredients and lists if they can contain gluten or not. When someone hands me a packaged food that I'm unfamiliar with, I can quickly verify that there is no gluten in the product.<p>For people like me, I just can't imagine living without my iPhone. If it were 10 years ago I would mostly be relegated to eating at home or bringing my own food with me when I went out. Now I can even travel without concern.",1338659993

4058648,comment,4058506,4058506,3,0,Shish2k,,,"I don't know how to <i>solve</i> the problem, but I have thought about it; some thoughts:<p>The computing industry seems to keep repeating cycles with local and remote processing - thin terminals and mainframes, then the desktop PC, now ""The Cloud"" is mainframes 2.0, then mobile apps are starting to bring native code back to the user again (although many are tied into the cloud) - similarly, online communities keep alternating between distributed (BBSes + IRC), centralised (myspace, AOL), distributed (forums + IRC again), centralised (facebook + twitter). As such, the churn of users from one system to another is pretty much constant. (There are many reasons for users to move from one system to another, but this is the one that I've seen as an inevitable constant since the internet began, and other reasons are different each time).<p>How does users moving around relate to quality of community though? Perhaps I'm being subjective and biased, but it seems to me that the highest signal to noise ratio happens at the front of the wave, the masses with the pop culture are the middle, and the ocean of spam trails behind. As such, if we assume that users will move from one system to another no matter what, the degredation of community at a given location is inevitable.<p>Taking slashdot as an example - the technical side of it, while not perfect, was fairly good and did a fine job back when a handful of technically-inclined people used it; but when it became overwhelmed with average people, there's nothing the system could do to stop it (I don't think HN is immune to this either, it just happens to be at the front of the wave right now). Also in the case of slashdot, the editors started treating the average people as their target audience, which accelerated the decline...<p>Also, thanks to things like Ubuntu, slashdot's niche of ""linux users"" stopped being a niche, thus opening the floodgates - I find that communities are generally better when you need to put effort into finding them, rather than them being the default that the lazy people go to for a popular subject (note that this isn't quite hipster sentiment - that would be to say the subject <i>itself</i> becomes worse when it gets popular).",1338659731

A high learning curve is what makes people ""new to FOSS"" have difficulty with emacs/vim, not a lack of usability.<p>And Gnome is also a bad example, since it is both usable and has a minimal learning curve. At my last job we set up a crowd of 30 fashionistas (no tech background whatsoever) using gnome with no real issues. Several of them also used inkscape with little difficulty.",1338659707
4058646,comment,4058140,4058140,2,0,mikeash,,,"First of all, how can you rationally hate something? Hate is inherently irrational. Anybody who hates anything hates it irrationally. The title should simply be, ""Engineers hate advertising tech"". The use of the word ""irrationally"" is simply a lame attempt to paint us as being objectively wrong, which doesn't even make sense.<p>Second, I think a lot of people have good reasons for disliking advertising tech. Beyond a certain point, advertising essentially becomes a zero-sum game. The people who see your ads are only going to spend so much money on stuff, and once you've saturated that, the best you can do is move the money around. It's unlikely that your product is vastly better than what people would otherwise find. Advertising can certainly help get the word out about truly excellent new products, but that use is vastly outweighed by simply trying to switch people from one brand to another mostly equivalent one.<p>Because of this zero-sum nature of much advertising, it becomes a race to the bottom. In most markets, if competing products A and B both improve an equal amount, everybody benefits. In advertising, if competing ads A and B both become more effective at selling, little changes. The better ad will continue to work better, but the absolute effect will not change much. (In reality, all ads compete against all other ads to an extent for people's money, but the point still holds as long as you look at all of them.) The trouble is that an ad's effectiveness is only loosely tied to its aesthetic value or utility to the viewer. In other markets, when competitors race to improve their products, the result is awesome products. In advertising, the result is ads that are continually larger, louder, brighter, stupider, more difficult to bypass, more insulting, and more annoying. Companies race to one-up each other's ads and the rest of us are just collateral damage in their war.<p>Ads are intruding on more and more of our lives, including <i>things we pay for</i>. Everybody I know hates sitting through ads after paying $BIGNUM at a movie theater, but somehow the practice has become universal anyway. I suppose it hurts sales less than it boosts revenues. This helps the theater, but it doesn't help <i>me</i>. Tickets didn't get any cheaper when ads went in. For an internet example, take Hulu Plus, which I understand is now showing ads to paid subscribers.<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, ads are probably the single greatest non-government mechanism for invading our privacy today. Ads work better when they're targeted based on personal information, and the result is private companies with vast amounts of information about everybody's browsing habits, held and used in a completely opaque and unaccountable fashion. Ad networks are becoming vast spy networks that just happen to be used for the relatively benign purpose of getting us to buy stuff. And you wonder why we don't like ad technology?",1338659703

4058632,comment,4058087,4058381,4,0,bratsche,,,"> Also stop blogging and fix it if it's a problem<p>In case you don't know who mpt is, he's actually one of a handful of people out there who <i>is</i> trying to fix these problems.  He worked on usability for Mozilla for awhile, and now he works for Canonical.  I used to work on the Ubuntu desktop experience team at Canonical, and I can attest (as much as my opinion is worth anything) that mpt was easily the most valuable person there in working towards usability.  He's not one of the ""make things look pretty"" kind of designers, it's definitely one of the ""functionally elegant"" types.  Part of his work is designing new Canonical-led features in Ubuntu, and part of it is proposing better interaction designs for apps that came from the community; some of that work is then coded by developers at Canonical, or by the upstream project maintainers, or random community developers, and sadly some of it is just put off or ignored.  But the point is, he's the guy who is working to fix design problems.<p>I think the point of his post was to try to encourage more thought towards the design process by the open source development community, and maybe to encourage more non-developers to get more involved in the design process.  He's only one guy, there's only so much he can re-design on his own.  You know, days having limited hours and all.  So if he spends a couple hours doing some ""community outreach"" type blog posts and manages to get even one other person to start working on interaction design then he has accomplished more with those couple hours than if he had used them redesigning a part of some app.",1338659490

The Tarzan paper mentions why this might be problematic and suggests instead a decentralized P2P system, using a mix network with (what you might call) onion routing and cover traffic.<p>The authors claim this eliminates the ""single point of failure"" and the effectiveness of even network-wide analysis. And since Tarzan should be ideal as a drop-in middle-layer, I'd think this would fit an application like BitTorrent.<p>Unfortunately we never got to use Tarzan in our project, so I of course only have the paper to go by.<p>[0] ftp://163.25.117.117/gyliao/iSmart/1-P2P/2-Anonymity%2BIdentity%20Management/Tarzan-A%20Peer-to-Peer%20Anonymizing%20Network%20Layer.pdf

The puzzles are there to watch people think on their feet.  The detailed questions are to see if you're looking at someone superficial or someone with deep knowledge of the subject matter.  The programming challenges are to see if the applicant wants the job badly enough to spend a couple of hours working on a programming problem that can then be used as a showcase for how they write some software.<p>Earlier in my career, I didn't have all those interview techniques in place.  When I started, hiring people was a complete crap shoot and I ended up with some total lemons.  Like the warning labels on products you buy, each interview technique I added to the process was the result of a lame hire that in hindsight, I could have avoided had I used that technique.<p>The last job I had to interview for used all the techniques above.  I found the interview process to be thorough and challenging.  I appreciated the rigor of the interview process since it meant that the people hiring really gave a shit about the quality of the people joining their small team.  I got the job.  In point of fact, if they hadn't had a thorough interview process, I probably would have passed on the job offer since that would have been an indication to me that they were naive and didn't have their crap together.<p>Do you want to send me your $100 via Paypal?",1338657128

This is easy money for most software engineers because they have exactly the skills that will be posted on the ads, criteria that are checked, etc.  I think even your challenge misses the point of the article which is when we post wanted ads we put down such specific skill sets that if we rigidly stick those skill sets, just like our software does, we'll miss the people that can grow into those roles.<p>The irony is that software engineers are so much rarer than everyone else in the market we can easily be hand screened thus bypassing the very software we created.  Finding software engineers is really hard because there are so few so either you don't get a lot of people applying, which makes it easy to screen by hand, or you set the bar very low to get people in the door.  Then you go through 6 months to find the right person.<p>If you aren't a software person its much much harder to find a job because there are so many other people looking for jobs.  You have to compete much harder, downward wage pressure, etc.  Hence the volume increasingly demands automated solutions that make it even harder to get past the screeners.<p>I happen to agree with this article that we do a poor job of specifying the skills that are absolutely mandatory vs. what's nice to have.

From now on, it will be the year that ended March\n2012. The revised calculation also incorporates more-\ncomprehensive data on corporate activity and newer surveys of spending by households and informal businesses.<p>The government also said Friday that its benchmark measure of economic growth will henceforth be based on market prices, not on factor costs. The latter method, which India had previously preferred, tabulates economic activity based on the costs of production, whereas the other method is based on the amounts paid by consumers. Most countries and international bodies calculate GDP based on market prices.</i><p>The base year for any country&#x27;s GDP calculation is normally recalibrated every 5 years or so to adjust for structural differences in an economy - sustained changes in the prices and of goods and services that are not attributed to inflation, which pegging to the CPI of a base year is intended to mitigate. These structural changes in the economy are due to new technology, changes in the production process, changes in social/cultural norms, etc. Anything that affects supply and demand other than price level. So this isn&#x27;t a big deal.<p>The more interesting piece of the puzzle is the decision to move from cost-of-inputs based calculation to an expenditure calculation. This is an accounting problem for any economy that is transitioning from a goods-based economy to a services-based economy. In developing economies, a lot of value is produced outside of the market - eg cooking, cleaning, raising children vs. eating at restaurants, hiring cleaners, hiring nannies, daycare, etc. As more of these non-market goods/services move into the realm of the market, they start to count towards GDP under this new expenditure-based GDP calculation. This can lead to overinflated, overoptimistic growth projections.<p>At the end of the day, most countries calculate GDP using expenditure-based vs. cost-of-production so it means we will be comparing apples to apples when we talk about GDP in the US vs. the UK vs. India. But the real question is: when will we create a better measure of growth than GDP? One that factors in pollution and emissions at the very least is long overdue.",1448996399

You want to minimize that. It&#x27;s also extra fuel, but relative to the total cost of a launch, fuel is essentially free.<p>If you can reuse the rocket, then that becomes much less important. Maybe you spend 10-100x more building engines and tanks and structures than you would if you had a more efficient design, but you get to amortize that cost across many launches, so it&#x27;s much less important.<p>Reuse is, of course, a big if. A gigantic if. The gigantic-est of all ifs. The big question is, &quot;will it work?&quot; If the technology simply doesn&#x27;t work, or if it &quot;works&quot; to get to orbit but requires so much refurbishment that it&#x27;s basically like building a whole new rocket each time (see: Space Shuttle), then it&#x27;s not practical. But if it <i>does</i> work, then who cares if you drag 10x more mass to orbit than you strictly need to?<p>I am very much in a &quot;I&#x27;ll believe it when I see it&quot; mode with Skylon, but to me the objections center around the the hard work of going from theory to practice, and the lack of visible progress with same.",1448996376

MicroProse and Sid Meier disputed this, with Meier saying he&#x27;d never played the board game before designing his <i>Civ</i>, but AH stuck to its guns. Since they&#x27;d published the board game, they argued, and since (they asserted) MicroProse&#x27;s computer game was just a derivative work based on it, all rights to the <i>Civilization</i> name <i>for both board and computer games</i> belonged rightfully to them.<p>They then licensed the name to Activision to use in developing its <i>own</i> computer <i>Civilization</i> games, to compete directly against MicroProse&#x27;s in the marketplace. MicroProse responded to this by buying the company owned by the original <i>designer</i> of the board game, Francis Tresham (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Tresham_%28game_designer%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Tresham_%28game_design...</a>), arguing that if the board game gave anyone claim on the <i>Civilization</i> name it was Tresham, not his publisher AH, and that in acquiring Tresham&#x27;s company they&#x27;d also acquired not just any computer-game rights the board game would confer, but the rights to <i>the board game itself</i> too.<p>AH was in pretty desperate financial straits by this time, so in 1998 they caved and paid MicroProse $411,000 to settle the dispute, yielding to them all rights to the name and stopping publication of the board game. (See <a href=""http://home.earthlink.net/~pdr4455/fah.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://home.earthlink.net/~pdr4455/fah.html</a>) MicroProse then gave Activision a limited license to the <i>Civilization</i> name so they could publish their work-in-progress game as <i>Civilization: Call to Power.</i><p><i>Call to Power</i> came out to mediocre-at-best reviews and sank like a stone, ending Activision&#x27;s dream of taking over the franchise. But MicroProse&#x27;s victory was short-lived, because their own financial situation by this time wasn&#x27;t great either; just a couple of months after the Avalon Hill settlement the company was sold to Hasbro, at which point it was more or less dismantled and became just another zombie brand.",1448995968

10657777,comment,10652979,10652979,0,0,NoGravitas,,,"> This stressful, ongoing debate fuels the seeming paradox of an “endearing” military force. In Japan, where indirect communication is highly valued, cute illustrations have long played the role of tension-breakers and mediators in situations of conflict. Thus kawaii mascots, whether miniskirted girls or bunny-rabbit decoy launchers, are both a reflection of pop-cultural trends and a way to defuse the very touchy issues surrounding the military’s undeniable presence.<p>Contrast this to the way [The Culture][0] dealt with their ambivalence over having to tool up to fight a full-scale war (the Idiran War). They specifically designed their warships to be ugly, and gave them ship class names reflecting the ugliness of their roles (e.g. Gangster, Torturer, Psychopath, and Thug). While depicting your weapons as <i>kawaii</i> is very different from depicting them as heroic/inspiring, I think the Culture&#x27;s lack of euphemism is the better way to go.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture</a>",1448995895

I am taking the example of Kerala , a small coastal state in the southern part of India. This small state in India has made great strides in economy as well as high living standards. I think this has to do with the high literacy rate in the state due to various socioeconomic & political reasons.

But its infant mortality rate is very low, its literacy rate among the highest on Earth, and its birthrate below America&#x27;s and falling faster. Kerala&#x27;s residents live nearly as long as Americans or Europeans.

I don&#x27;t even care if it&#x27;s exposed over CardDAV, I just want to get automatically-added addresses out of my normal user addressbook. A couple of weeks ago I realized that my addressbook had a bunch of contacts in it I didn&#x27;t recognize, so I cleared them all out. Today I checked and there&#x27;s 3 more unwanted contacts.<p>It actually feels very broken to me that FastMail is automatically adding things to my address book without asking me, and without any obvious way to turn it off. I don&#x27;t mind it recording this stuff in a separate addressbook to use for spam filtering and for auto-filling during message composing, but it should not be part of my normal addressbook and should not be coming down over CardDAV for my user addressbook.<p>The reason this is a problem is because I use my FastMail CardDAV addressbook as a shared addressbook for me and my wife (she doesn&#x27;t use FastMail herself but I do), since we use iCloud for our normal address books but iCloud doesn&#x27;t have a way to share addressbooks. It occurs to me now that since I&#x27;m actually using a Family account (for a single user, so I can have a custom domain without having the more expensive plan), I have a Shared address book available and I should just switch over to that (since I assume nothing ever auto-adds there). But it was still a rude surprise to find a bunch of unknown contacts appearing in my Contacts app on iOS.",1448994943

Air at sea level is about one thousandth the density of normal rocket propellants and thus the machinery for compressing that air (inlets, spinning compressors, in Skylon&#x27;s case heat exchangers) is large. Air breathing engines need to be much larger than pure rocket engines of equivalent thrust, and thus heavy.<p>2) Since it&#x27;s the first stage engines, they are large because of that. SpaceX for example has nine engines in the first stage while only one engine in the second stage. If we assume 500 kg per engine, 8 engines saves 4 tons. Since their payload is about 10 tons, they would only have about 6 tons of payload if they flew with all engines to orbit. (Not a very precise calculation I admit.) Why would they do that? And that&#x27;s with rocket engines that have 150:1 thrust to weight ratio. Modern operational air breathing engines have about 10:1 thrust to weight, one fifteenth of Merlin 1D.<p>3) Carrying oxygen isn&#x27;t as big a problem as it seems to be. It&#x27;s denser than water so the tanks are actually small. And rockets already have tremendous thrust to weight as we have demonstrated.",1448994507

I&#x27;m someone who pretty universally supports the rights of others to be themselves, however that might be, and be treated with respect as a human being.<p>That said, the term &quot;safe space&quot; is something I&#x27;ve never personally encountered being used in the context you present it in.  When a group of like-minded people come together in a private space, they don&#x27;t then declare &quot;This place is a safe space for $x people&quot;.  It&#x27;s obvious that everyone present is of like-mind, and those who are there for purposes other than discussion of the topic at hand can be expelled through social means as a consensus action of the group without any need for authority involvement.<p>Meanwhile, I often hear the term &quot;safe space&quot; used by people when they want to take over a shared space to insulate themselves from people who might disagree with them or maybe even be bigots towards them, while in public.  I am not in any way arguing that bigotry is socially acceptable, but it is protected speech, and while it is perfectly appropriate to tell people that their bigotry is offensive, inappropriate, and unwelcome, it&#x27;s not appropriate to ask that an authority come in and forcibly establish a zone <i>in a shared space</i> where-in some speech is okay and other speech is not.<p>My opinion, which I think is largely in-line with the person you replied to, is not one born out of hatred or bigotry, it&#x27;s born out of concern about the death of dissent.  It&#x27;s a concern that our culture is shifting to one where everyone lives in an echo chamber and is intolerant of any ideas not of their own making.  It is perfectly acceptable as a society to be intolerant of intolerance, and that includes both intolerance based in bigotry as well as intolerance based in delusion.  This is not an argument in favor of people &quot;just taking it&quot; when others behave in inappropriate ways towards them, but it is a plea for reason around dissent. Respectful disagreement is not offensive or inappropriate, even though some people may use disrespectful terms in their dissent which themselves are offensive or inappropriate, that does not mean that all people who disagree are inherently offensive.  It is not oppression to disagree with someone, it is oppression to prevent dissenting opinions.<p>Given that so much of the influence and respect people in the public eye have these days is based on the appearance that they&#x27;re socially/politically appropriate, it&#x27;s very clear how claims of victimhood can be used to intimidate.  In some cases, I don&#x27;t have much sympathy for those who have come under fire since they are in a position to clearly state their position and walk away relatively unscathed, but some people unfortunately are not in that situation.  Take for instance, the two Yale professors who clearly argued for school administrators to allow students to define their own standards and for students to have a discussion, instead were reviled unfairly by some students who instead want administrators to use their authority to impose speech controls.  Unfortunately, those Yale professors have less influence with which to save themselves than the administrators who more often come under fire.<p>Perhaps the most confusing thing to me about this whole situation is that in most cases the people calling for &quot;safe spaces&quot; are people who are part of marginalized groups or are saying that they act on behalf of marginalized groups.  The social concepts surrounding free association, free speech, and dissent are there to protect marginalized groups.  It allows them to exist, gather, and discuss their ideas, thoughts, experiences, and feelings and to publicly disagree with people who are in the majority groups and be protected from the oppression of being silenced by authority while doing so.  It seems strange to me that the people claiming to be proponents of marginalized groups would want to take away these protections from anyone.<p>I could write more, but I don&#x27;t think it would lend anything else to the point I&#x27;m trying to make.  If anyone reading this is unable to understand the difference between free association of like-minded people in private spaces vs trying to enforce speech controls on everyone, including those who may not be like-minded, in a shared space, and why the latter might be concerning to many for reasons that do not originate from any personal hatred or bigotry, I will attempt to clarify further.  Otherwise, I hope the above is well-stated enough to put forward that position.",1448994030

One night before gift day I always tried to stay awake at night trying to take a peak at them and their camels. But every time I would fall asleep and would wake up to see gifts already there. Eventually I realized it was all not true (first step towards rationality). I was not heart broken, it was gradual really. And I&#x27;m left with very fond memories of that time.<p>You only get to experience that magic once. I&#x27;m glad I did.",1448993121

Very forward-looking, thorough, consistent, and great for admins of the time. Still the only capability system bringing in revenue. Adapted pretty well to modern stuff but main OS&#x27;s issues & stagnation hurt it as you said. I think the fact that it&#x27;s pricey and proprietary kept the OSS innovation out, too.<p>However, the change to the AS/400 and POWER cost it one of its greatest features: hardware-enforced integrity at the object level. That&#x27;s the feature that would still be giving hackers hell if it was widely deployed. The Intel i432 APX and i960MX had similar property. Interesting enough, IBM actually has secure CPU&#x27;s they&#x27;ve prototyped and even sold to select customers. Would be great if they integrated one with IBM i at microcode, compiler, and OS levels. That plus an optional interface for new customers without legacy crap would be a huge differentiator that might give it new life.",1448993050

The same staff in charge of counseling were also often involved in BJU’s disciplinary infrastructure—in a school where students could get in significant trouble for an astonishing array of infractions, from not keeping their rooms clean enough to going off campus without permission. Students routinely were expelled without notice.<p>>In an uneasy mix of roles, Jim Berg served as both the head counselor and head disciplinarian. But the problem was broader than his particular purview, as victims described an environment where they were afraid to come forward to get help after being raped, because they feared being punished for breaking another rule during their attack. One student who was struggling with the revelation of her childhood abuse told GRACE she was placed on disciplinary counseling after she was caught smoking cigarettes, and Chancellor Bob Jones III attempted to impose an even harsher sentence of restricting her to campus for a semester.<p>>Particularly harrowing was the experience of a student who alleged that her pastor had been raping her since she was 15, and who came to BJU officials when she became pregnant as a result of ongoing coercive sex with the pastor. But because she had lied about going off campus to meet him, BJU kicked her out of school.<p>>BJU officials defended its comingling of counseling and discipline as something that made sense within the school’s enduring adherence to the practice of in loco parentis— the quasi-parental role that most colleges abandoned fifty years ago—but students described its effect as both chilling and retaliatory.",1448993050

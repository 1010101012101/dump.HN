4645289,comment,4645121,4645121,3,0,patmcguire,,,"Slate is typical. Arrogance is pretty much a given in any grammatical/typographical discussion. In the land of the pedants, the man who says ""you and I"" is king.<p>The vim ambiguity is part of the greater English punctuation suckage. If I end a sentence in Jr. or St., am I supposed to double up on the periods on the end, or will that just make me look stupid? I already had a period followed by a comma there, which looks pretty bad, and ""My personal hero is Martin Luther King Jr.."" just seems wrong.<p>Also, I think I'm supposed to write a comma after a quotation, but I would have done that I would have written '.."",'. That's pretty bad, and only compounded by the period at the end. I'm not sure that it's in the right place, either - should it be inside the quotation marks according to the normal rule or can I put it outside the quotation marks to avoid ambiguity? Why is it so difficult just to write a sentence without it going horribly awry?",1350053983

Everyone and their brother has written a basic tutorial outlining how to get up and running with Flask. This is a GREAT post and I do not want to demean it ... however I think that a lot of this can be gleaned from following along with the docs and experimenting with Flask in general.<p>I'd really love to see/hear some stories of others using Flask at a slightly larger scale. For example ... did your startup build their REST API in Flask? Sure, people say it's possible and outline a basic hello-world style REST app ... but in my experience it became a pain in the ass very quick. Primarily because no structure is enforced.<p>After being a Python dev for a long time, building quite a few big Django apps and a handful of tiny Flask apps I have finally jumped ship to Rails. I spent a week experimenting with various Pythonic combinations. Ultimately I had to ask myself ... ""Why am I doing this? What the hell am I wasting my time with this lightweight framework?"" I've built my current REST API in Rails and would not have it any other way. It's been tremendously efficient and performs great on my little Linode in London + PostgreSQL.",1350053030

4645201,comment,4639085,4640737,1,0,Silhouette,,,"Thanks (to both of you) for the replies.<p><i>We're really not just blowing smoke here.</i><p>I'm not claiming you are. On the contrary, I agree your argument, under the right conditions. However, I <i>am</i> concerned that you are generalising way, way too much and you're setting up a lot of naive but entrepreneurial young developers for a nasty reality check.<p>Here in the UK, the vast majority of freelance/contract work isn't the kind of lucrative consultancy gig that various HN regulars seem to be arguing everyone should move towards. Obviously there is a significant amount of high-end consultancy work around, but mostly the freelance market is more about having a flexible workforce, where local businesses can bring in extra resources on demand without the overheads of full employment and freelancers retain a lot more flexibility than full-time employees working for a single employer. The freelancers are often still working with others, it's just for a specific project and with arm's length management etc.<p>Now, please consider that there is usually no way for someone in that position to demonstrate the kind of direct value contribution that is the basis for your arguments to clients that much higher rates are justified. If nothing else, it may be impossible to properly separate the value of contributions from different contractors working on the same project.<p>Moreover, it's all very well arguing that your contribution has raised X for the client (for some impressively large X) and so you are worth a significant chunk of that X in fees, but this relies on the fact that the client can't buy a contribution of equal worth to them for a lower price elsewhere. There are numerous highly skilled freelancers who by their nature are always looking for the next job, and unless some sort of mass unionisation happens or you're talking about an extremely specific niche where literally only a tiny number of consultants could do the job at all, you simply aren't going to be competitive at 10x the going rate. Sure, maybe you're worth it, but that still doesn't help if any of 20 other people with a similar skill set is willing to do the job to a similar standard but for only 2x the going rate.<p>So while I have no objection to pointing out that developing valuable skills and then pitching yourself as a consultant in a certain field can be extremely lucrative relative to being a freelance code monkey, I do think it's misleading at best to suggest that all, or even most, freelance software developers can just put their rates up rapidly and change themselves into consultants in the way that worked for you guys (and to some extent for me, I suppose). The strategy doesn't scale to the freelance software development industry as a whole, and in many cases it would never work if individuals tried to do it alone without taking the relevant part of their profession along with them <i>en masse</i>. Even if it did, it would probably mean doing a very different job and potentially giving up some of the benefits or choices that motivate many people to turn to freelancing in the first place.",1350052823

No spamming.<p>By broadcasting real-time streams via TV you would get a bandwidth ~400 songs/day/channel (a big selection for the time). To me 'subscribing to interest categories' would be exactly like subscribing to a cable channel; and it would give you the legal right to that group of songs.[0]<p>It seems 'TV cable' was definitely a transmission method (very unclear if the phone was an alternative data vehicle or just for control), and AFAIK there was no way of doing anything on-demand with TV cable. To get similar quality of audio via the phone would have taken ages[1], tying up the phone for a long time (+ associated costs). The only problem with the streaming model is that you have to wait for a song to come around. But you would be able to get a newly released song right away on it's first play (and <i>nothing</i> was on demand at the time) so it wouldn't be a big issue IMO.<p>Occam's razor suggests the stream concept is most likely; it fits the existing models and technology much closer. It would have been technically simple to implement and vastly cheaper.<p>--<p>0.

4645073,comment,4640530,4644129,1,0,CookWithMe,,,"You are right, my wording was incorrect. I'll try to put what I wanted to say in the words of Dr. Thomas Puzak, IBM: ""Everyone knows Amdahl's law, but quickly forgets it"".<p>That said, Amdahl's law does NOT apply to problems, it applies to programs: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law</a>
What I was trying to say is that, from my experience, if you take an existing program and try to parallelize it with minimal effort (e.g. parallelize all loops), then you may end up with having a serious percentage of serial code. (Or you don't, because your data is large enough, see Gustafson's law: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustafson%27s_Law"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustafson%27s_Law</a> )
However, if you put in more effort and re-architect the program, you'll usually worry about a lot of problems, but Amdahl's law is not one of them. Yes, you didn't ""avoid"" Amdahl's law (and you can find counter-examples where Amdahl's law is a real concern).<p>I actually heard a talk about ordering in in-memory databases. It basically comes down to Gustafson's law: If your dataset is rather small, the overhead of parallelization (some of which can be attributed to Amdahl's law) isn't worth it, you just do it on one core. But because your dataset is small, it is so fast that nobody cares. If your dataset is large, each core sorts a subset. Then you start aggregating, and the final aggregation is serial. However, because you already have sorted lists, you can use a different algorithm that merges this very quickly (but would perform bad on unsorted data). I can't remember any specific numbers, but the bottom line was that even with a very beefy server that had 4 sockets and plenty of cores, the serial part wasn't an issue in terms of overall performance. Keep in mind that the author talked about a Multi-core myth and not a Many-core myth.<p>Again, I don't argue that near-linear speedup is possible for most problems. Most often it's not. But naming Amdahl's law as the only reason is wrong.",1350050879

No it was just horrible to synchronize both devices with my work and study related stuff (Yeah I know now better that it is a charm with Dropbox).<p>While I was  deciding if I should sell my iMac I decided to sell both iMac AND my MBP. Why, you ask? My MBP was just fine but sometimes I had to carry a heavy books plus MBP with me and this was why my back was hurting. So I decided to switch to something lighter and faster (and yes my MBA is way faster than my MBP ever was).<p>After selling both devices I bought a MBA with 128GB SSD and 4GB Ram and happier than ever before. This was one of the best decisions I made in my environment. And if anything happens to my MBA I will order a new one with thinking a moment about it.<p>Pro's:<p>* It is very fast,<p>* it is light as nothing else,<p>* I have instant-on (something which is really important to me),<p>* I have 5-6 hours of battery life,<p>* Eclipse runs really really smooth,<p>* XCode runs even smother,<p>* and every other development related works just fine (and sometimes I think even better as on my MBP)<p>Con's:<p>* No glass display (I loved it cause it was way easier to clean than a ""plastic"" display)<p>* No keyboard backlight (while this was bothering me at the very beginning, I have to admit that I don't care anymore)<p>At the bottom-line I want to say that unless you are working on really high computation stuff (like 3D rendering or something) a MBA will do it smoothly. I never encountered anything which I had performance problems with. (If you ask me I would wait a second longer in exchange to carry much less weight with me)<p>Disclaimer: I don't play any games and try to escape Flash everywhere possible (cause it lets the fan freak out).",1304018646

Gosh, perhaps they even want to meet <i>other people</i> for lunch! As shocking as it may seem to you, all of these things are entirely compatible with enjoying one's job.<p>At my last job (which I can only I assume I must have hated, although to be honest it didn't seem like it at the time) I almost always went out for lunch, on my own. Sometimes I made a sandwich that morning; often I bought something from the market. I bought a coffee; I took my time. I thought about the problems I was working on, and often, it was the most productive time of the whole day. I figured out the architecture of the applications I was building, and wrote code in my head. When I got back to the office, I sat down at the computer and typed it in. In fact, I'd probably go so far as to say that if I'd been sitting down and chatting while I had lunch, my overall productivity would have dropped precipitously.<p>This is by no means an argument against socialising with one's coworkers; it's not even an argument against having lunch with them.

You go at anytime (in the meal times), take what you want, eat it there or eat it at your desk.<p>You can eat with team mates, by yourself, with friends from other teams, with random strangers or whatever.<p>I <i>love</i> this for several reasons:<p>1. There is obviously the cost aspect (not having to pay for lunch) but for me this is probably the least important part;<p>2. It saves so much time. Other places I've worked, going out to lunch means 30-60 minutes for a lunch break. Here you can eat and be back at your desk, if you want to, within a few minutes. Waiting for elevators, waiting in line, etc are all such incredible time wasters;<p>3. When choosing where to go and what to get for lunch, you're basically asking me to make decisions I don't care about. This I hate. Here I simply choose what cafeteria to go (typically the closest one) and take from the selection. I don't have to decide about where to go, what to get. I simply taken what's (generously) offered.<p>(3) for me is probably the most important. This one applies to software and hardware too and is (IMHO) one of the key reasons for Apple's success: Apple is unafraid and unapologetic about making most decisions for you. These decisions are right for most people most of the time.<p>Joel had an old blog post on this (probably the famous ""Controlling Your Environment Makes You Happy"" one that everyone should read) that said something like this: every option you give someone forces them to make a decision. I would go on to add that every decision has a cognitive cost, which simply annoys the decider if they're deciding on something they don't really care about.<p>Now, on a smaller scale I can see work lunches being a problem. If you need to be there at a set time, have limited opportunity for mingling or your team is so small that if you don't want to get stuck with someone (eg you don't like them or you simply don't want to talk about work).<p>So I see edw519's point.

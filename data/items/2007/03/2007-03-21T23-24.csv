The downward slope for film is slower (more people involved, 100 instead of 10), but headed the same direction. <p>There's no reason, with hundreds of aspiring producers and engineers, that a good band with limited resources couldn't cut a great album for $1k instead of $100k. Given, of course, that the band could find a producer willing to work for the same reasons they want to play.<p>",1174520624

Followed the site & found this site. <p>Interesting points:<p>  - backers are business types <p>  - no tech founders at the head of the table.  <p>  - not transparent (no information on terms, process)<p>The reason YC is an interesting vc prospect is the whole process is <i>transparent</i>. You know the details upfront.  Not so with other companies, why?",1174518134

As an obvious example, the NLP is currently limited in terms of the variability of ways to add things to your shopping list. Adding more variants of that would be easy.<p>The huge amounts of data they're gathering about what people actually use this for is indeed a huge advantage. With that kind of data, they can build a centralised dictionary of common patterns for asking just about anything. Because of Siri's practical orientation, there is no need to build a ""generic NLP engine"" (which is what you're, quite rightly, suggesting is slow to improve). They merely need to improve the effectiveness of the NLP engine they already have, by making it understand more common patterns. That's achievable through expert-system-like functionality that's existed for 30 years.<p>In terms of the voice recognition, that has been progressing steadily for 30 years too, and I imagine Siri will benefit from improvements to the technology base, as others will.",1319630350

It's because command lines are only better for very advanced users and/or people with an exceptional memory.<p>Fact is, with a command line you don't ""talk"" to a computer. You actually program it, with a kind of interpreted language and a plethora of libraries (executables). This means that you actually need to be VERY exact in what you write, you have to remember the ""magic incantation"" in every detail, or it will not work - or, likely enough, disaster will follow.<p>Vocal commands can be useful for the mass for very simple tasks, if the incantation is very easy to remember.

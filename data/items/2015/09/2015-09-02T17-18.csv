The best you could hope for is for companies to loudly prevent themselves in their contracts. Of course they could end up going through commercial third parties, or any other plausibly justifiable loophole when they get serious about increasing earnings. Even if they wholeheartedly break your contract <i>and</i> you <i>provably</i> find out, what was your consideration actually worth - a few dollars? You&#x27;d be in an even weaker position to show damages than you are now with the NSA.<p>The ability to consent/decline is indeed a powerful distinction between corporations and government - I believe our world would be much better if every association were voluntary and we could opt out of things we found harmful. But juxtaposing governments/corporations and arguing against one by wholesale endorsing of the other, especially for something as slippery as data, is a Faustian bargain.",1441216786

careers@ontoit.io<p>Ontoit is a technology startup founded and run by graduates from the University of Cambridge. We work on integrating large datasets into knowledge ontologies using machine-learning techniques and performing parallelised semantic search on big data. The end result of using Ontoit search engine is that meaningful relationships can be inferred between pieces of information. These relationships can be used to perform explicit semantic search through large amounts of data. The Ontoit search engine will assist industries in a variety of fields to find information and explore ideas in an integrative manner. In order to create the proposed search engine, we intend to combine five distinct fields in computer science: ontology engineering, machine learning, natural language processing, semantic search and distributed computing.<p>Ontoit will first focus on developing one application for the movie industry. Our first product will be a semantic search engine to traverse the corpus of movie information on the internet.<p>Here at Ontoit, we develop our entire backend in one programming language, Java. Spring framework forms the backbone of our web services. We develop knowledge representations using stacks of graph databases and technologies. Natural sentence queries are parsed through an engine built using Stanford CoreNLP. Computations are distributed to a cluster developed using Apache Storm. Data crunches for Machine Learning models are parallelised using Spark. We store our data in scalable, NoSQL Cassandra.<p>Our system architecture is designed in great detail with a high degree of modularity and scalability.<p>Ontoit is currently recruiting for multiple positions:
Team Lead, Core Developer, NLP Developer, QA Developer. All positions are full time and we offer competitive salary + significant amount of equity.<p>Please find more details at: <a href=""https://angel.co/ontoitholdings/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://angel.co/ontoitholdings/jobs</a>

(I shed a single tear for your cause.)<p>2. You suggest that &quot;we&quot; (presumably Western Christians) should be afraid of Muslims because the majority believe that &quot;non-believers&quot; should be stoned, etc.<p>3. You present &quot;evidence&quot; that shows that the majority of Muslims that <i>currently live in particular Middle Eastern countries</i> subscribe to those beliefs.<p>4. My retort: where is the evidence that Muslims refugees from those same countries to Western countries, actually believe those things at the same rate?<p>If you give me a poll of Muslim refugees in the USA/Germany/Sweden etc. with results that are similar to the link you&#x27;ve already posted, then maybe you have half a leg to stand on. Until then, enjoy your miserliness.<p>EDIT: It&#x27;s called a reply button. I&#x27;ve made no claims regarding the European countries in your example. Save for Russia, those are majority Muslim countries. Islam in Russia is a special case, with certain regions having dense pockets of Muslims. [1] Cultural assimilation would suggest that immigrants will tend towards whatever mainstream beliefs prevail there, in this case Islam. The same cannot be said for most Western European countries, where irreligiousness or Christian social mores prevail. Are you suggesting that Muslim countries kick their own Muslims out? Do you know <i>anything</i> about those countries?<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Islam_in_Russia.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Islam_in_Russia.png</a>",1441216615

All your story gives us is that there is a new market clearing price for labor at a lower price level, e.g. $P2 < $P. Fewer people are willing to accept labor at $P2, so they <i>voluntarily</i> go without work.<p>This is pretty much just basic supply&demand.

Making better use of interactive conversations does require some planning and discipline, to keep a list of what you need to discuss sorted by person.  But the benefits of that practice are numerous, and increased privacy and plausible deniability is a comparatively minor benefit.<p>A few reasons to prefer interactive discussion to email:<p>- plausible deniability and increased security<p>- reduced chance of misunderstanding<p>- less time spent and potentially wasted carefully crafting the perfect message, because you can monitor your recipients reactions in real time and dynamically alter your delivery depending on which parts are immediately understood and agreed upon<p>- collaborate on the ideas interactively and rapidly, rather than a simple one way transfer<p>Email is good for some things, but it&#x27;s seriously overused.",1441216482

The arguments pro-Hackathon point out that such events are unsustainable and you can&#x27;t expect to do it every weekend, and yet you also start to see Hackathons filling up nearly every weekend in a year and people that try to attend all of them that they think they safely can.<p>I don&#x27;t want to encourage &quot;crunch work&quot; and so I stopped paying attention to Hackathons entirely. Life is too short to burn so brightly on weekends for projects that mostly don&#x27;t matter. I do worry that Hackathon culture encourages more bad software business cultures that think that they need crunch or can survive on crunch and that &quot;everybody is doing it&quot;.",1441216294

The intelligent, educated and high tech India that you talk about and are surprised about has actually existed for ten thousand years now. It has nothing to do with modernity, its just that quest for knowledge is deep rooted in that culture. You mention India where phones don&#x27;t work and traffic jams are commonplace, in other words, India where its inconvenient to lead a modern life, even thats existed for ten thousand years, even during the harshest days of starvation under British rule Indians were reasonably happy and not many people revolted for 250 years (they had to be prodded to do so for the last 50 years). In a way, they were ok with it and had accepted it as a way of life. What in western countries is a huge inconvenience, in India it feels like something that you will get used to eventually. The feeling of its ok to be inconvenienced and still be happy in life is deep rooted in the culture.If you notice, both these things, quest for knowledge and resilience towards inconvenience is needed in spiritual quests, something which India pioneered to the world. India is in every way consistent with what it should be if you look at it its whole existence and not just take a snapshot of its past 100 years and correlate it with what is happening in the world. And thats precisely the reason why I think India will thrive in the coming decades and centuries. It&#x27;s quest for knowledge will propel it forward and its resiliency towards not being inconvenienced by petty things would keep the momentum intact.",1441216276

And they invented a fudge factor to get around this a bit (that still doesn&#x27;t work for all cases) which is to make sure the equations when taken in aggregate do not <i>generally</i> lead to negative expectations for not making a transaction.  This holds in many more cases but still not all.<p>Where does it fail and why does it matter?  Well, the axioms underlying the &#x27;markets tend toward efficiency&#x27; work great in capital markets.  They tend to completely fail when pain or death is potentially involved in a transaction (severe negative expectations) but they may look like they <i>should</i> work and you can find limited cases that <i>do</i> work.  So, basically war or crime or relationships or corruption or or poverty or healthcare or any other of those human interactions pain or death tend to come into play.

If justice and the police scale with the influx, refugees can integrate well and fast, even if their food and home practices might look different. If you let ghettos develop, you have a problem. In your example, the solution is not to let women or gays be oppressed, and not allow sharia courts to supercede the governmental ones. People can retain their views so long as they don&#x27;t actually go on and infringe on the rights of others, if they do they go to jail.<p>Singapore even outright discusses how fast infrastructure and services are growing and sets the amount of immigration for the year accordingly. I suspect if Germany really was willing to take up the majority of the million Syrian refugees (and mass immigration from any other country in distress), it would make sure to invest accordingly and be able to integrate that many as the US has done in the early 20th century [1] (so much for history).

Unfortunately, ADHD is a very poor name, because it really is not about an inability to pay attention. Hyperfocus is very common in people like myself who have ADHD. ADHD manifests itself as an inability to pay attention to things that are uninteresting or not engaging, an inability to change focus when appropriate, and difficulty with time perception and management.<p>Like yourself, until diagnosed, I would have never considered ADHD a possibility because I would regularly focus intently on a programming project or random wikipedia rabbit hole for hours and hours at a time, often skipping meals and staying up until the early hours of the morning. But it turns out these trances of hyperfocus are typical for many ADHD sufferers. There are different flavors of ADHD. I never experienced the hyperactivity that often leads to diagnosis in children.<p>Keep in mind that one of the requirements for diagnosis in the  DSM is impairment in social, academic or occupational function. In my case, spurts of hyperfocus routinely kept me from maintaining healthy sleep, diet, and hygiene routines, and ADHD also prevented me from doing homework and chores that were uninteresting. Unfortunately, there are precious few people who are able to exclusively focus on whatever engages their fancy at the moment. For me, it was debilitating.<p>Check out the video brazzledazzle posted above. You&#x27;ll learn ADHD is way more nuanced than the popular understanding.",1441215909

Stack allocation semantics have to do with when the object is <i>destroyed</i>, which Go does not have any way to control in the language. Value vs. reference types are totally orthogonal. To see how this is true, try creating a value type (such as a struct or an array) in Go and capture a reference to it in an (escaping) closure to defeat the escape analysis optimization.

In some cases, whether it&#x27;s sales or even Hooters, where obviously &quot;gifted&quot; females are sought after, it might be directed at one demographic. Odds are if you are a U.S. company and want to expand sales into China, you would most likely have a predominately Chinese sales team doing it. That&#x27;s just how it works, they are best fit for the job.<p>The view of looking at a company and saying &quot;it&#x27;s not diverse enough&quot; I believe is wrong. If all the people at said company were hired based on merit and best suited for the job, and it ends up being largely one demographic, do you think by using an Affirmative Action style hiring spree will make it better? That is what I&#x27;m saying should not be done. The fact that companies will see they are 20% women, and then when given the choice to hire for a position out of 5 candidates, they are told, get the 1 female in that group. Despite a male in the group is better suited for the position. All in the name of &quot;diversity&quot;. That is wrong and something we need to get rid of. The same is true in a vise versa scenario as well. Fashion is an interesting world that comes to mind. Many female clothing lines are actually behind a male name and designed by males. Many male clothing lines are designed by females.<p>Sure it&#x27;s easy to show a company, or the Navy, that has mostly hired males in the past which now hires more females, improve performance. That is re-balancing previous discrimination. Going forward though, they should not try to right their past wrongs by compensating on the other end, they should simply hire the best candidate for the position.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if my point is getting across. I&#x27;m not necessarily against what you re saying. If i have a start-up and I need to hire 10 people. I&#x27;m not going to say I&#x27;l hire 5 males, 5 females, 3 will be white, 3 will be Asian, 2 will be Hispanic, and the others international. NO. I will hire who I find that&#x27;s best for the position. At the end of the day, if I end up with 9 males and 1 female, and out of the males 7 of them are white, this should not be looked down upon. When I go to hire the 11th employee, the demographics of the previous 10 employees should not matter. Today it seems like people will say, because we have 7 white males, we can&#x27;t hire an additional white male. That is so F&#x27;ed up and needs to stop. It&#x27;s wrong on so many levels. The best candidates in all positions will make the company preform best overall, period.",1441215744

Experienced software developers with CS degrees typically have not used this knowledge in years and need to brush up.  Experience software developers with other degrees or purely self-taught software engineers often never learned these at all -- or in a very limited way.<p>Thus this first type of coding interview is geared toward hiring new college graduates, very strong new college graduates, with a CS degree.  It effectively discriminates against experienced/older candidates.<p>The other type of coding interview is a grueling test on specific languages, tools, algorithms, data structures etc. that the candidate would use in the actual job they are interviewing for.<p>Both types of coding interviews don&#x27;t necessarilly identify the ability to learn and adapt to new technologies or many other skills that are critical in many technical jobs.<p>The coding interviews tend to favor candidates who have both the time and inclination to drill heavily on the typical coding interview test questions.<p>Contrary to the writer&#x27;s comments, there are a large number of non-white &quot;Asians&quot; in software development jobs.

There&#x27;s a huge difference in the price of tokens in different regions, and I wonder if that&#x27;s partially due to manipulation by Blizzard to make tokens less valuable in regiouns like North America where people will pay more money for less gold.<p>But I think you&#x27;re misjudging negative reaction people have to &quot;pay to win.&quot; Maybe I&#x27;m not correctly reading the average player, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so much a matter of Blizzard having to keep up the appearance of fairness. The underground gold market has been around for so long and in so many games that people expect that money can buy in-game currency. There are other games which are designed to be fair like first-person shooters, but part of the draw of MMOs is that they are explicitly not fair. Coming in as a new player, you have to compete against people with significant gear advantages, and there&#x27;s an aspect of this that&#x27;s actually ego-boosting. If you can compete with people who have more resources, not necessarily win but at least operate close to their level, you can feel good about your skill, and when someone else has an advantage, you can excuse it because you know the system isn&#x27;t fair. It&#x27;s the same with games of chance, where you know that some of your failings are attributed to bad luck and not your own failings.<p>Where &quot;pay to win&quot; goes bad is when you feel like you need to fork over excessive amounts of money to compete at all and feel like the game is just trying to squeeze you for money. But the way WoW is designed, it&#x27;s relatively easy to get to the gear level of other players, and what&#x27;s really valuable is having people who you can work closely with. In the time it takes to develop those relationships, you will have more than enough put into the game to have the resources you need to compete. Although gold can be a nice boost and snag a few top-notch pieces of gear, it&#x27;s mostly unnecessary, and the really expensive items are usually vanity items.<p>So the unfairness is actually only a small part of the game which serves to excuse personal failings, and the really valuable resources: friends, time, and skill, are things which can&#x27;t be bought.",1441214372

The English mushed India together in the panic of independence in 1947, but little heed was given to ethnic, religious, linguistic, historic, national, or geographic considerations which is one reason India has had problems with every one of its neighbors since. India as we know it will not survive another 30 or 40 years.

We believe that cloud computing is an amazing technology and that everybody should be able to benefit from its advantages. That&#x27;s why we decided to reduce the price of the C1 to €2.99 per month or €0.006 per hour, effectively reducing the price by 70% compared to the previous price (€9.99 per month).&quot;<p>Why must you say that?

In fact, what we are trying to solve are the following situations:<p>a) In a context where there are a lot of developers and you have worked hard into improve the code style and someone else pushed code that again violates your &quot;implicit&quot; code style. Do you need to correct these bad practices over and over again?<p>b) There are some boring tasks that punctually appear like &quot;refactoring&quot; when deprecated methods appear or developers need to upgrade one external library version (eg. one critical bug appears).<p>Anyway, thank you for your opinion :-)",1441213539

PostgreSQL has had functional indexes since essentially forever: MySQL seems to have only been given a way to simulate this feature two months ago, by the same people who are working on this JSON support. The real question you should be asking is the opposite: how MySQL handles indexing arbitrary JSON content, and the answer is that given how it is only just as of two months ago capable of indexing limited JSON content, the answer is that MySQL has nothing to say on this matter: PostgreSQL has spent decades pushing the boundary on index technology, while MySQL was trying to make multi-master replication possible (the one use case people have where MySQL seems to ever make sense; though it still isn&#x27;t clear that this form of replication is theoretically sound :/).",1433602446

  The First Amendment covers the rights of US citizens 
  Nike is protected by the First Amendment
</code></pre>
He then goes on to say that one would conclude that Nike, being a person, has kidneys according to some medical database.  First, the ontology: why would you join a medical ontology on &quot;person&quot;, instead of something more rational like &quot;human&quot; (you know you&#x27;re going to have medical data for animals as well)?  Second, logical failure: the second statement is not one of exclusivity, you cannot actually link the third statement to the prior two.<p>I&#x27;m sure this guy is very clever, and has plenty of great qualities - but he has built his argument around the failure of logic, when it is clear that he doesn&#x27;t know very much about it.

They tend to ride temporary booms in whatever their specialty is (eg the real estate bubble days), and also peak out at a certain age bracket (their earning power peaks for only a few years out of a long career).<p>If you have this seven year peak earning power: $300k, $500k, $600k, $1m, $600k, $500k, $300k - you&#x27;ve yielded $3.8 million in earnings, paid a likely ~$1.5 million in total income related taxes, and have $2.3m left before life expenditures. You&#x27;re 52 years old, and your earning power has peaked. You have $2.5 million in savings and investments. That has to last the rest of your life and retirement; you spend $10k per month in total life expenses, and have two children, and a decent house with a mortgage; your income will never be much higher than $300k again, and you&#x27;re going to pay ~30% in income taxes on that.<p>That&#x27;s closer to a normal scenario for a $1m earner, than the one where they just yield $1m per year for 20 years and never have a financial care in the world.",1433601720

It all depends on balancing your intake with the amount of energy you consume during the day.  The only problem is that it takes a lot of heavy physical work to use those calories and the exercise regimen that most people assume comes no where near to what it takes to use up the amount they take in.<p>As far as quitting before you actually really start exercising, there was a good quote by Muhammad Ali circulating the other day [1] &quot;I don&#x27;t count my sit-ups. I only start counting when it starts hurting.  That is when I start counting, because then it really counts.

Also we had rather low crime and view people had to worry that they could be poor when they are old.<p>Than came globalization and the notion that the &quot;free market&quot; will be always right and will make things (automatically) perfect. (That was promoted by Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Reagan, to name two early adopters). Than the governments in Germany and all over the world started to bend. &quot;It is the free market, we can not do anything against it&quot; was said by them. &quot;We have to bend our laws to comply with the free market&quot;.<p>So it was going all over the world.<p>What do we have today: All over the world, people get richer ... 1% of the people.

So if for example, you have a family predisposition to a certain type of cancer, then you have no way to find out how to financially plan for the possibility you might also get it, and have to start the medication for it.<p>In the US at least, I still firmly believe that prudently planning for severe medical conditions is simply not feasible, even with &quot;catastrophic coverage&quot;, for families with less than $10M in liquid assets, and $40M in total assets.",1433601265

For CS you have to allow self-reference and that is expressly verboten in ZFC.<p>I assume you are referring to the axiom of foundation which implies, for example, that you cannot find three sets A, B and C such that A ∈ B, B ∈ C, C ∈ A. This is <i>not</i> an obstacle to talking about self-reference, recursion or cyclic graphs, etc. The axiom of foundation keeps the membership relation from having cycles, but it doesn&#x27;t keep you from talking about other relations that might have cycles! Indeed, defining functions recursively is completely standard practice in mathematics, and is formalizable in ZFC with no problem. Also, the most common definition of graph is explicitly in terms of set (a graph is an ordered pair (V,E) where E is a set whose elements are pairs of elements of V)and easily formalizable in ZFC. That you can&#x27;t have ∈-cycles never comes up in, say, the study of cycles in graphs or of recursively defined functions.",1433600629

While Thunderbolt has in theory always been able of supporting external graphics (it’s just a PCIe bus), the biggest hold-up has always been handling what to do about GPU hot-plugging and the so-called “surprise removal” scenario. Intel tells us that they have since solved that problem, and are now able to move forward with external graphics. The company is initially partnering with AMD on this endeavor – though nothing excludes NVIDIA in the long-run – with concepts being floated for both a full power external Thunderbolt card chassis, and a smaller “graphics dock” which contains a smaller, cooler (but still more powerful than an iGPU) mobile discrete GPU.",1433600513

In Ruby it&#x27;s the same: unless you exercise your code you don&#x27;t know if it works. Now, think of a classically compiled language like C and C++: if it compiles, does it mean that it works?

All of the studies have found little to no effectiveness in the death penalty being a deterrent.<p>As for other crimes and punishments I am not aware of any specific studies. Although I would say that for the most part the threat of a jail sentence for any length of time is a deterrent in my opinion. If it were not a deterrent society would see much higher crime rates than we currently do as simply no one would be deterred by the threat of going to jail.

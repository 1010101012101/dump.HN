It's a startup, doing online paid services for foreigners willing to come to Germany. We have employees for each country, native speakers, and it's very hard to find all of them in one city to be able to work in an office space. Therefore we can only work remotely. But we can't communicate, solve problems properly and effective online. We hired some of them from their country, thousands kms distance from Germany. When we hire, we must explain the workflow which is very hard explaining it online. We used:<p>Trello
Skype
Mobile tel
Complex explanations are drawn in Photoshop(!!!) sent via emails<p>None of them were useful and everytime when I hire someone I try to fly there and explain the work etc. Can you please list your favorite tools communicating your remote employees.

3451725,comment,3449077,3449077,1,0,racER,,,"Well, I can't see any specific advantage on using C/C++ as backend of a plain old CGI API. Personally I'd use PHP or something like that, which integrates tighter with the web server. Using C on CGI is propably not very much faster compared to an optimized PHP environment with precompiled (cached) p-code.<p>> ""C programs are suspectible to memory corruption."" (tptacek)<p>Yes, they are, because in C you <i>can</i> do memory corruption, in many other languages you <i>can't</i> (even if you'd want to).
But where do these corruptions most likely occur, when speaking in context of web applications? Yes, in I/O and string operations. And all these can be mitigated with somehow ""safe"" classes - by these I mean not a home-brew string-class, but something like STL (which has proven stability).<p>However, is memory corruption the only security risk? In my opinion, an average C/C++ programmer creates more secure code than an average PHP programmer - just because a C programmer is <i>used</i> to the intrinsic security issues, while the PHP coder won't produce an buffer overflow by not validating input, but leaves eg. XSS or SQL injection holes.<p>Writing a web application in C without preparing for safe I/O & string operations is as bad as writing dirty script code in PHP/Perl/Ruby/...<p>At my company we've written a really big web application (a hosting control panel) completely in C/C++, but for other reasons than execution speed: the runtime dependencies of a sellable web application are pure horror. Neverending CPAN-depencencies in Perl, incompatible function changes in PHP, and so on. With a monolithic app (web server & application logic all-in-one) you just need a libc - that's all.

If someone uses your photo without permission you have not lost the photo so it does not need replacing.<p>What he may have lost is the price he could have commanded for exclusive use of the image, because he can no longer sell/license exclusive use (as it has already been used). So what he would need reimbursing for is the value he could have gained through such licensing (plus any relevant legal and admin fees), not the cost of taking the photo (which might be far a greater amount, or might equally be a far lower one). It is an <i>opportunity</i> cost issue, not a time-and-materials cost issue.<p>The ""cost to make from scratch"" argument isn't really valid either: you have to consider supply and demand of the ""images for license"" market as generating the image from scratch is <i>far</i> from the only alternative option. There may be many photographers out there with similar images at a much cheaper rate - said images may be less perfect for the intended use, but the price/availability difference may make this an acceptable compromise.<p>Of course he has now set a fixed price for the image If you use it without negotiating a different price then this is what you can expect to have to pay when found. It might be a silly price, but that is the price: take it, leave it, or try negotiate something else - simply taking something for nothing because you disagree on price (the position taken by many people when they try to justify downloading a movie or game from an unofficial source) would not be acceptable.<p>Your point regarding only publishing the small version of the image publicly is a valid one, and the only way to protect the exclusivity of the larger format image: but this isn't perfect because once the larger format image is out there it is no longer protected because it may be used in a way that allows it to be copied and reused without permission (any contract with an exclusivity clause would need to be carefully worded to make it clear who is responsible for protecting said exclusive use: who (the creator or the licensee) should be responsible for chasing unlicensed users who have taken the image from the licensee's materials? (the source copied from being identified by the watermark you describe)).",1326289931

In practice, that means rural and less-well-funded schools.<p>There obviously has to be some prerequisites. Perhaps the solution would be a summer school for students without A Level computing. Most universities offer a foundation year for people who want to study engineering or maths related subjects but don't have the A levels required. However, given that you only need to cover under 1 semester of work, you'd be pushed to convince people that because they didn't study a computing A level they have to add an entire year to their degree.<p>Probably the best option would just be to make it a strongly required subject, and cover the basics in less time.

The photos that we received were amazing and we were really happy with the results.<p>I spoke to him on the day of the wedding and he gave me almost the exact same story you've just posted.<p>It seems to me that every industry that relies on technology gets seriously disrupted when the technology becomes cheap enough - printing, publishing, photography and I'm sure there are many more.",1326287316

The biggest problem is that every kind of ""external"" help (like, for example, EU lending money to italian banks at a low interest rate) is only going to help Mafia because they're deelpy entangled inside the italian government and banking system. The only viable strategy would be for EU to lend money directly to small businesses... but that's not going to happen.",1326287293

But the scientists have to publish in big journals to win public funding grants, and the big journals aren't motivated to go open access and surrender their cash cow.<p>So you're not likely to budge either the scientists or the journals by arguing about what's ethical. It seems to me like the best approach is to change the way public grants are awarded. If grants become conditional on you ONLY publishing in open access journals, well you don't have much choice do you? Ultimately this whole game was only ever about attracting the money you need to do your job. Pretty soon the expensive publishers stop getting submissions because they're all diverted to open-access journals.<p>Of course it would never be so easy in reality. There is a pretty entrenched chicken-and-egg situation with science publications, and it will be unavoidably messy to break it.",1326286836

One weekend when nobody was around he decided he wanted more out of the project than research credit, so he let himself into the research lab when nobody was around, copied everyone else's code and took off to get VC funding.  Later he would dismiss the whole thing in typicall dirtbag fashion, ie, ""Well, you know, it's hard to recall who wrote what code, and what counts was I got it out to market first, etc.""  So basically he stole somebody else's work, took credit for it, and then hid behind the legitimacy that financial success brings in this country.",1202741671

I don't think there's anything wrong with setting up your own company and then employing some other people to fill in any skills gap that you feel you might have. Personally I've always found it easier on my own... I make the decisions (for good or bad) after consulting with people, but there are never any issues or deadlocks where decisions can't be made because its down to me ultimately.  Why do you feel you need a co-founder? Just curious and not wishing to start another thread on the merits either way",1202740365

That way the programmer could provide comments as verbose as he liked and the reader could decide whether to view them. They could include links, additional documentation, etc. The code and comments could be viewed in a split-screen, separate windows, etc. Maybe this exists?",1202739341

And for other South Africans (sorry, US here).<p>As a single founder who sometimes feels pressure (mainly from here) to not be a single founder, I would hope to see more posts like this.  I realize the ycombinator is not a matchmaking service, but what better place to look?<p>You don't mention a compelling reason for starting a business other than ""the way the Rand is going"".  Do you have an idea (or even a concept)?  Or are you purposefully not sharing it?<p>Which brings up an interesting question.  If you're a single founder looking for co-founders iN a public place, how much should you share?",1202738822

Plenty of people working in C find it plenty expressive. Is it &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; expressive to choose to express different things? I don&#x27;t think so.

If we were to break down your &quot;requirement&quot; into user stories, I count the following user stories:<p>1. As a user, I want to access this application through my web browser.<p>2. As a user, I want to know how many times I have clicked the button.<p>3. As a user, I want to know how many times the top 10 users have clicked the button.<p>4. As a user, I want the interface to update immediately when I click the button.<p>5. As a designer, I want the ability to easily change fonts, colors and layouts.<p>6. As a product owner, I want the ability to push updates to my users automatically.<p>Your technical requirements all roll up to these user stories. If you wanted to do this as an iOS app, it would be pretty trivial: you could almost build the whole thing in InterfaceBuilder. But the web browser is an abstraction layer we&#x27;ve built because it carries with it certain architectural advantages.<p>The web browser makes simple requirements much more difficult, I will grant you that. But it makes other requirements much simpler: rather than having to provide a mechanism by which to upgrade users&#x27; compiled applications when I want to add a red button and a blue button, I just push the changes out to the server and every user sees both the red and blue buttons. I also no longer have to write network code to connect to a server: my web browser does that. When is the last time anyone wrote a network stack for an application? Everything is REST services and JSON now.<p>Yes, writing web applications is very complex. But that complexity allows us to do things that were very, very difficult only a decade ago. The cost of being able to do hard things easily is that trivial things are somewhat less trivial to do than they would be in other environments.",1404829862

Granted, making a native iOS app can be arguably more expensive than a Chrome plugin, but it also shows where the market is pointing for this particular niche. Not many people I know of would willingly purchase this app to solve a mobile http connection issue they normally would solve with a free plugin for their desktop browser, especially when it&#x27;s going to be a rarely used utility.<p>I think a tiered approach would be a fantastic way to ease consumers into the product. Not only would these developers get a much larger install base, but it would also help the entire app store economy grow more accustomed to more expensive apps, countering the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; effect the author cites as a reason they charge the amount they do.",1404828335

The hateful things that people write are mind boggling! It costs less than a Starbucks coffee yet they feel like I&#x27;ve robbed them blind. My theory is that the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; that occurred years ago when the app stores began are to blame - as developers/companies we had a chance to establish appropriate expectations but blew it. From here, it&#x27;s an uphill battle but I think sticking to our guns (charging for apps) and educating friends/family about the true costs/work effort behind apps is a great first step.",1404828256

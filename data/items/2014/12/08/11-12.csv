Read up on modern digital forensics. Everything you do on a machine leaves a trace and there are ways to recover those traces and put together exactly what you did. That is exactly what Incident Response/Digital Forensics Firms do. An IR firm would never tell you to just reimage a machine when you&#x27;re dealing with an advanced attacker. They&#x27;d want to go through, use the tools they have to identify exactly what happened on the machine and what other machines were compromised before they even started talking remediation. Wiping the one machine that you got an alert on would do absolutely nothing to solve the problem.",1418039929
8716012,comment,8714477,8714477,0,0,rachbelaid,,,"As the author, it may be good that I clarify the goals behind this post.<p>First I&#x27;m glad that this post made HN first page for a second time.<p>I encourage to read this comment because it summarizes well few of the missing features in Postgres about search. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8715624"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8715624</a><p>It&#x27;s not the first time that I get similar feebacks and I understand that &quot;Enough&quot; is subjective notion and maybe I should&#x27;ve pick an other title like &quot;Postgres full-text search for basic search need&quot;.<p>Just to clarify, this post is not against ES or SOLR. This tools are great and really powerfull but obviously this tools will better than Postgres Search. ES / SOLR are tools build to be anly around document store and search and on the otherside the search in Postgres is only one feature in many.<p>I think there is multiple reason when you would want to give Postgres search a go:<p>- You have no experience with ElasticSearch or SOLR<p>- The project is still early stage and you don&#x27;t want to invest time/money in a secondary datastore (eg: ES cluster)<p>- You want to give quickly a search feature (maybe not perfect) in the hand of your user<p>- Team knowledge, you may want to be careful before introducing a new tech to your team and ensure that people understand it. There is nothing worst than introducing a tech and being the only one who can maintain it.<p>The tech world is big and doesn&#x27;t only apply to Startup usecase, I worked in very different environment: Financial institution, Open Source company, Startup and Service company. A thing that I learn is that you don&#x27;t always have flexibility. In some company having new servers is long process and even if I hate you have to do with this constraint then you have 2 choices front of you: You do nothing and wait or you move yourself to offer to your users a workaround solution without any extra dependency ... That&#x27;s what Postgres search can be in some usecases.<p>From my experience, if you are already using Postgres and you find the right documentation (this post try to describe a start to end example) then I think you could get a search working in 1 day of work without any extra servers or resources.<p>I don&#x27;t have any experience with SOLR so I will have to pick ES, but if you never used it then you are going to have loads of &quot;fun&quot;:<p>- Sync. ElasticSearch IMHO cannot be used as a cannonical datasource so you will need to figure out a sync strategy. Some people may argue on that but I don&#x27;t think that ES started with this goal in mind. They may change direction now but still I wouldn&#x27;t store my data only in ES.\n <a href=""http://aphyr.com/posts/317-call-me-maybe-elasticsearch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aphyr.com/posts/317-call-me-maybe-elasticsearch</a><p>- Hosting. In the case that you are not using a hosted ES service then you will need to learn to host and build a cluster and also monitor it.<p>- Learning to use it. After reading ~50pages of doc then you start to figure out how to use type mapping, custom analyser and the 42 ways to do a search query.<p>I can only speak from my experience but it took me ~2weeks to get my head around all this point without any previous experience.\nThe project for which I used PG search and wrote this blog post recently moved to ES. More or less, 1y later and I&#x27;m glad that the PG solution was good enought until now. In our case we needed to support more languages: Japanese, .. and I also wanted to get rid of a bunch of triggers.<p>The results are good and very fast but for english the results are quite similar to Postgres solution. I think that&#x27;s mainly because I&#x27;m using much only ES basic feature, but we have loads of room for improvement which is a good position to be.<p>Now there is few other usecases where you may want to consider PG search:<p><pre><code>  - you are using MySQL and you are using the builtin then moving to Postgres can give your search a bit more power\n\n  - Side project using Postgres and you want to start a search feature.\n\n  - Search on machine output, case where analyser doesn&#x27;t really matter and you don&#x27;t need stemming. Lucene features for tokenization and stemming are great.\n</code></pre>\nTo summarize, I don&#x27;t think that PG search is a silver bullet but it may be &quot;Good Enough&quot; for your need to get you started. Spend 20min and read the post and then maybe it&#x27;s also good enough for you. On the other hand if you know already ES/SOLR and you got the resources then it become less relevant to use Postgres Search. ES/SOLR (tools base on Lucene) are amazing and really feature rich, if you have important search need and long term plan about search then you should look into them.<p>If you are interrested about the PG search and you want to know more about it than I suggest you to have a look to this blog posts. I think that the author did an amazing job.<p><a href=""http://shisaa.jp/postset/postgresql-full-text-search-part-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shisaa.jp/postset/postgresql-full-text-search-part-1....</a><p><a href=""http://shisaa.jp/postset/postgresql-full-text-search-part-2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shisaa.jp/postset/postgresql-full-text-search-part-2....</a><p><a href=""http://shisaa.jp/postset/postgresql-full-text-search-part-3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shisaa.jp/postset/postgresql-full-text-search-part-3....</a><p>I don&#x27;t know if people will be interrested but I thought few times about writing a following blog post &quot;When Postgres search is not Enough&quot; to describe how to integrate Postgres with ElasticSearch with JDBC River to pull content from the DB..

8715995,comment,8714635,8714635,0,0,seszett,,,"I have been experimenting with contenteditable myself[0] (for a small instant messaging project [1]), and indeed I found it quite difficult to use. The problem is you&#x27;re constantly going to be doing things <i>against</i> the browser.<p>For compatibility reasons I have to support a small fixed set of tags (b, s, u, tt basically) but of course none of the contenteditable commands use these tags, so I ended up using selection and range to insert the tags myself, and actively ignoring the browser&#x27;s default shortcuts (ctrl-B, ctrl-I, etc automatically work in some browsers). The API for accessing selection is also different from that of simple input elements.<p>Now, I actually want <i>pseudo</i>-WYSIWYG - that is, I want bold text to be shown in bold, but I still want the <b> tag to be shown in light grey so you know it&#x27;s there and you can edit it yourself. But people can also sometimes post just a &quot;<&quot; in their text, so basically at every keystroke the control has to parse the whole text again, insert whatever tags and apply whatever style might be necessary. Without forgetting the convert back to spaces the &quot;&nbsp;&quot;s the browser has helpfully included in the text.<p>Anyway, what I wanted to say is contenteditable is really not as usable as it could be, and there is a lack in pseudo-WYSIWYG libraries which just allow you to type your text using HTML (or markdown) tags and render them along with the final text.

You don&#x27;t have to handle deletes, which is certainly the trickiest thing to try to keep in sync, but once you have some external cronjob or whatever running your code over all the full text entries, you might as well just make that job insert the data into ElasticSearch.  Most of the difficulty in setting up full text search outside of the DB is creating and managing/monitoring the process to shuttle the data out of the db and into ElasticSearch, and if you are going to do most of the work, you might as well get the benefit, rather than just shuttling the data out of the database and then back into the database.",1418039139

Some are obsolete and terrible, like CORBA or java serialization. Others are gotchas w weird semantics, like Object.clone(). Others are just bad API design--eg the built in IO libs don&#x27;t require a Charset argument. The default is the &quot;system default charset&quot;, which is apparently <i>still</i> the obsolete MacRoman if you&#x27;re on OSX.<p>The most annoying are those shortcomings of the std library that cause extra complexity. For example, the built-in JUL logging framework sucks enough that almost everyone uses log4j or logback instead. But now you have user libraries using incompatible logging frameworks. Enter slf4j, a shim that ties them all together.<p>In my experiemce, Go is a breath of fresh air.",1418038740

Instinctively I understand that that is fucked up, but I can&#x27;t explain why, because I know &quot;that&#x27;s the future&quot;.<p>Part of it. But there are other parts of the same future that scare the shit out of me.\nThe fact that it has accelerated the rate of planetary destruction to unprecedented levels, by making globalisation possible and required. The fact that tech is now controlled by several corporations with mantras like &#x27;don&#x27;t be evil&#x27;, which is telling, because it means that it is possible to be evil with this tech and the amount of evil that can be done is equal to the amount of good that it brings.\nThis tech is godsend for evil people and in many countries, control of the Internet is the most important condition for holding power with an iron fist.<p>Maybe, just like the splitting of the atom, the Internet is one of those things that shouldn&#x27;t have been invented?",1418038425

Griping about the ignorance of others is awfully hard to distinguish from boasting about your superiority.<p>For the vast majority of problems, knowing Knuth is about as useful as being able to quote Tacitus, compose a Petrarchan sonnet, describe the Krebs cycle, or recount the details of Australia&#x27;s 1882 victory at The Oval.<p>You would have had the same blank look if you demonstrated your microkernel operating system, LALR parser, or Needleman–Wunsch-based sequence alignment tool.<p>Why should they care? If you can&#x27;t explain to them why it&#x27;s important, then perhaps it actually isn&#x27;t important for the job.<p>My previous comment objected to the idea that people should be rejected solely because they know esoteric knowledge.

A better argument might be that &quot;web pages should gracefully degrade, and are only using these vendor prefixes temporarily for internal testing development: people who ship production websites that rely on these features are doing something inherently wrong&quot;, but developers can&#x27;t just &quot;fall back&quot; to the standard without doing something even worse than that.",1418037083

8715883,comment,8713270,8713270,0,0,vog,,,"The &quot;this&quot; keyword in JavaScript is a well-known anti-pattern. Although it can be explained with a few rules, it becomes cumbersome quickly.<p>The anti-pattern around &quot;this&quot; is well-known for decades. For example, SICP explicitly mentions that anti-pattern. Of course, it doesn&#x27;t refer to JavaScript, but to some other old programming language which had a keyword with very similar issues. I think it&#x27;s not a hyperbole to say that in this regard, the JavaScript/ECMAscript language designers haven&#x27;t learned from the past.<p>The main issue is that &quot;this&quot; violates lexical context.\nFortunately, the lexical context is easily restored by declaring a normal variable, usually named &quot;me&quot;, and using the fact that variables have always lexical scope in JavaScript (as it should be):<p><pre><code>    var me = this;\n    someFunctionWithCallback(function() {\n        me.something(...);\n    });\n</code></pre>\nAnother workaround is adding a &quot;scope&quot; argument to functions which take callbacks:<p><pre><code>    someFunctionWithCallback(function() {\n        this.something(...);\n    }, this);\n</code></pre>\nOr:<p><pre><code>    someFunctionWithCallback({\n        callback: function() {\n            this.something(...);\n        },\n        scope: this\n    });</code></pre>",1418036533

But the bit about how basic, non-product-oriented research is a distraction and a waste of effort leaves a bad taste in my mouth.<p>Look at one of the cited examples:<p><i>> AT&T had Bell Labs, created Unix, and never made a successful product out of that work.</i><p>Which, sure, OK. But on the other hand, ask yourself where Apple (since we&#x27;re talking about them here) would be today if Bell Labs had never existed. Bell Labs invented UNIX; no UNIX means no BSD, which means no NeXTSTEP, which means no OS X. Bell Labs invented C; no C means no Objective-C. Bell Labs invented the freaking <i>transistor</i>, without which the idea of a &quot;personal computer&quot; would have been utterly ridiculous. These are all fundamental inventions that made entire generations of tech businesses possible.<p>So one way to look at it is Gruber&#x27;s way, that skipping out on R&D means that Apple is &quot;focused.&quot; Another way to look at it would be that Apple is a freeloader. That they cheerfully take useful things that are only available to them due to the generosity of others to build products on, without seeing a need to ever be the generous ones themselves -- to replenish the commons that made their own fortune possible.<p>That&#x27;s probably good business, at least in the near term.

After all, nanotubes are known for many years, and their properties are sufficient for the tether, so in principle it can be done. No, the main problem is with satellites. In fact, asking many times - what to do with existing or future satellites - I never heard a workable answer, even in principle.<p>Just a reminder - every satellite crosses the equatorial plane twice for every rotation around the Earth. Majority of satellites are below the geostationary orbit. So, given enough time every satellite will hit the tether - and even if tether is near-zero width, the satellite isn&#x27;t.<p>One of ideas was to dynamically move the tether - from the Earth, making propagating wave along the tether, which would avoid the satellites. This means we need the good means of watching the space and predicting satellites movements - even small satellites can bring trouble. But that&#x27;s not enough, we might get a situation when we need to perform conflicting movements, considering the current state of the wave.<p>This problem is well known for decades. Attempts to launch satellites from the elevator - and the elevator makes it tantalizingly cheap, so we&#x27;ll want to launch many - will exacerbate the problem. The whole world astronautics will have to adjust to accomodate the elevator - and nobody knows how it is going to look like.",1393395194

The font-variant-ligatures style enables the use of OpenType &quot;liga&quot; and &quot;clig&quot; ligatures, but then the font-feature-settings style overrides that with &quot;liga&quot; and &quot;dlig&quot; (discretionary ligatures).  What that means depends on how your font designer flagged their various ligatures, of course, but the page is explicitly opting into more than just common ligatures.",1393394652

7303232,comment,7302902,7302902,8,0,yajoe,,,"Don&#x27;t have a dog in the fight, but interesting how the uberX page doesn&#x27;t mention specifics of the proposal beyond &quot;put hundreds of drivers out of business and effectively shut UberX down.&quot;  Where are the links?  The specifics?<p>The actual proposal may be found on the city&#x27;s site [1].  It also would help to provide some context for the types of changes, which both an opinionated summary from the local newspaper [2] and somewhat impartial summary from a local tech site [3] do fairly well.<p>For the tl;dr who don&#x27;t want to click away:<p>1. Seattle defines uberX, Lyft, etc as Transportation Network Companies (TNC) and declares all drivers as &quot;for-hire&quot; drivers, which is a legal distinction that means Seattle can regulate them.<p>2. TNCs are taxed at $50k for first year.  Second year is the greater of $50k or .35% of gross revenue.<p>3. No more than 300 drivers may be associated with each TNC (it&#x27;s a permit lottery regime, if you are curious), and each driver can work only 16 hours.<p><i>Yes, that means that each TNC is limited to 300 x 16 = 4800 hours of work per week.  A previous proposal had a limit of 100 drivers [5]</i><p>4. Drivers can&#x27;t double dip: They can&#x27;t both drive for-hire cars and also do uberX on the side.  They also can&#x27;t work for both uberX and Lyft.<p>5. I can&#x27;t find a cap on the number of TNCs that will be licensed, even though that seems to be one of the (perhaps past?) sticking points.<p>6. Rates may either be flat-rate between preset zones OR subject to RCW Chapter 19.94.  RCW Chapter 19.94 [4] defines appropriate measurement devices that may be used with commerce, which I think precludes most cell phones... uberX would need to install meters it seems.<p>Details likely only I will find interesting:<p>1. TNCs have to have valid insurance for all vehicles, and this insurance looks like it is stricter than what uberX and Lyft currently have.<p>2. TNCs must have an office in Seattle that is open and personally staffed all business days between nine a.m. (9:00 a.m.) and five p.m. (5:00 p.m.) with toll-free number<p>3. The TNC shall submit to the Director a report detailing all rides that were requested but not accepted by TNC drivers. The report shall include the location and zip code of each rejected ride.  There are penalties for discriminating against underserved zip codes.<p>4. 30% increase in the total number of taxicabs, including an immediate increase of 8% &quot;today. &quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.seattle.gov/council/issues/taxis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seattle.gov/council/issues/taxis.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://blogs.seattletimes.com/opinionnw/2014/02/14/seattle-uber-taxi-regulations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.seattletimes.com/opinionnw/2014/02/14/seattle-u...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.geekwire.com/2014/seattle-delays-ride-sharing-vote-council-member-says-need-time-get-decision-right/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geekwire.com/2014/seattle-delays-ride-sharing-vot...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=19.94"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=19.94</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.geekwire.com/2013/sidecar-uber-express-disappointment-seattles-proposed-ridesharing-regulations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geekwire.com/2013/sidecar-uber-express-disappoint...</a><p><i>Edit: Formatting and spelling</i>",1393394573

7303230,comment,7299237,7300854,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"Sorry, I miscalculated. I counted whole weeks instead of work days, which is 250 days, so really it should be $520 for $2 a day for 260 days with 2 (full) weeks vacation.<p>Your logic is strange, though. You mention that considering the high cost of living, $14 won&#x27;t go very far. The insinuation, I guess, is that because it doesn&#x27;t go very far, it isn&#x27;t worth much? When really the fact is that since goods and services in SF have much higher value, each dollar you save is that much more important to being able to afford even the basic necessities (like rent, much less food and transportation!)<p>&quot;What you consider&quot; to be a minimal amount of money is what some people consider %3 of their annual income. For you that&#x27;s probably what, $3,000? You can probably afford to lose that and it doesn&#x27;t really affect your life much, which is why you have such a skewed view on what is minimal or worthwhile and what isn&#x27;t. For a lot of people, $56 a month is the difference between having to borrow money from family to pay the rent or not, or having to decide between feeding everyone in their family for the week or not.<p>Hybrid car? Okay, I get it, either this is a troll or you seriously just don&#x27;t consider anyone other than yourself to matter, and thus this idea of saving money is nonimportant to you. But it could be life-saving to other people. Like someone once told me, &quot;Hey fool, this ain&#x27;t no football game!&quot;",1393394530

7303227,comment,7302770,7302916,6,0,MichaelGG,,,"Right but that is probably deceptive. Just like you can mount a network drive and it &quot;looks&quot; like local storage. If you treat that memory naively (even like on 1TB RAM NUMA systems), you&#x27;re in for a bad time.<p>As a reference point, getting a cache line from one CPU to another on the Xeon 5600 takes ~300 cycles, IIRC. That&#x27;s just in a two-socket cheapo machine.<p>It could be considerably worse in this system.<p>I&#x27;m not experienced enough, but so far from what I&#x27;ve dealt with, treating NUMA systems as separate nodes and coding them as such is the best way to deal with things. And it lets you scale out to multiple machines easily, too. But there&#x27;s probably some workloads that benefit from having what appears to be a single memory space. SQL Server, for instance, is aware of the various memory hierarchies and can optimize around it, so it might allow scale-up where scale-out is simply not an option.",1393394521

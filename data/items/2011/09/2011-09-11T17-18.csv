2984314,comment,2983884,2984223,12,0,lukeschlather,,,"Race and IQ are not scientifically precise tools. Both are fundamentally subjective. Why do we say that Barack Obama is a black man and not a white man? If we are to have a logically precise definition of race, both statements are true or neither is. In a genetic context, most African-Americans are just as much white as black. But in a study comparing disease rates among ethnic groups, African-Americans and Caucasians are treated as disjoint sets.<p>IQ is just plain subjective. You would likely get similar results by sitting the designers of the IQ test one on one in a room with someone, and then having them rate the people they talked to by how much they were interested in the conversation.<p>I don't think that Turkheimer is saying that you can't look at race and IQ in a scientific context. What he's saying is that the concepts of race and IQ are more grounded in opinion than fact, and when we see them in scientific studies we should be wary if they are not mentioned in the same breath as other subjective classifications like religion or political affiliation.",1315763912
2984313,comment,2983884,2984250,5,0,yequalsx,,,"In a truly free market system too big to fail can occur.  Bank runs, financial panics and collapses occurred for centuries before governments made explicit or implicit guarantees to banks or other large enterprises.<p>That there wasn't a total collapse of the banking system in 2008 was precisely because of government intervention.  Everyone would have withdrawn their funds from banks had it not been for FDIC.  Imbalances can't be prevented.  What can be prevented is a total collapse and the effects of imbalances can be mitigated.  This is one of the main reasons for the modern interventionist view of governments with regard to market regulation.<p>The goal is to prevent millions of small bad decisions ending up adversely affecting the whole country.  This is my problem with libertarianism.  There is no mechanism for dealing with the scaling issue.  Negative externalities are not dealt with.",1315763908

However, the insertion rules included checking whether a rotation on the inserted node would result in a subtree that could again be rotated by the same rule.  This gave a cutoff ratio of left-to-right counts, below which it didn't make sense to rotate-- and hence kept every subtree pretty nicely balanced.<p>Another benefit to having the node counts-- and this, I think, was the original motivation-- was it made the tree ""binary"" not only for looking up a particular key, but also for looking up the Nth key-ordered entry (which was important in the application).",1315763555

About two years ago I realized that a significant chunk of my time was reading. I would read howtos, api docs, in depth analysis of things, both directly related to my job that day and programming in general. I did an analysis and realized that I was easily reading the equivalent of a 1000 page book a week.  I have since taken efforts to both increase the quantity and quality of my reading, and it has paid off. I actively seek out topics I am ignorant of, and deeper articles on topics that have interested me. I also try to look at tools I don't expect ever to use. In all these cases I just read. This has given me a breadth I hadn't enjoyed before, and I suddenly have access to a whole new understanding when I and my co-workers encounter problems -- ""hey let's look over here for ideas, that field has encountered similar problems""<p><i>DO NOT EVER LEAVE THE COMPUTER IF YOUR PROGRAM DOES NOT RUN.</i><p>I disagree with this.

But as someone who does study complex systems sometimes in my day job, I find <i>that</i> argument for libertarianism extremely unconvincing. Most complex systems you find do <i>not</i>, left alone, function in any sort of reasonable way. They are full of crazy oscillating attractors, pathological feedback loops, more-stable and less-stable states that you (or an actor in the system) can deliberately manipulate it into, etc., etc. ""Well-behaved"" dynamical systems are comparatively hard to design even when you're deliberately designing, and ones you just find somewhere are usually not well behaved.<p>Which makes me particularly skeptical of ""the market just works"" type analysis, which claims that this <i>particular</i> complex dynamical system does not have all those pathologies, and in fact can be analyzed with fairly high-level, aggregate laws like the classical economics analysis of supply/demand adjustment. Heck, even fluid dynamics (another complex system) doesn't work that way--- all our general laws about how pressure/flow/velocity/etc. relate only apply to specific flow regimes, and can have different or even opposite-of-normal relationships in different flow regimes (especially anything turbulent).<p>One argument for why there should be some intervention would be: the classical-economics analysis of how economies <i>should</i> work is an appealing one, but is not in fact how they always work, so the government's job should be to dampen out the pathologies and turbulence that would take us out of the ""normal"" regime where the classical laws do apply. That's sort of the line taken by ordoliberalism. The question would be whether it can, on the whole, do more good than harm. But I wouldn't start from the assumption that what you get without government intervention operates ""well"" or ""ideally"".",1315762862

The message I got out of it is to question my assumptions about the flow of history, most specifically about things that ""everyone knows are true"". For instance, why doesn't everyone know that you have to plan projects in certain ways if you expect them to get done at a certain time? Well, in part because the idea of getting done at a certain time is new to this half century (which is a small amount of time in history) and because the idea of project planning is about as young. Even now those ideas are getting disrupted too by other things that everyone's suppose to know are true.<p>Basically Anathem introduced me to the historical progression of ideas and the constant forgetfulness of that process as its practiced by at least Western society. You can make the argument that academics know that this isn't the case, but I'm not sure that they're not caught up in the same progressive forgetfulness as the ""common person"".",1315762708

2984250,comment,2983884,2984120,1,0,jdietrich,,,"It doesn't matter whether the market is right or not. What matters is that the market <i>is</i>. Politicians routinely forget that. Communism's core failure was ignoring the irrepressible nature of market forces. The same applies to our system of capitalism.<p>One of the core factors that drove the credit crisis was ignoring market forces. ""Too big to fail"" led directly and obviously to recklessness. Bankers knew that they had nothing to lose and everything to gain. In a system where a government explicitly or implicitly guarantees banks, there is little incentive for anyone involved to guard against cataclysmic failures. As we so often do, we privatised gains and nationalised losses.<p>The desire to fix ""market imbalances"" is only that, a desire. The evidence is that most attempts to fix the market only make things worse. If we merely want to be <i>seen</i> to be doing ""the right thing"", then it's reasonable to legislate and hope for the best. If we actually want to improve the world, we must recognise that the market is tantamount to a force of nature.<p>Decades of trying to control wildfires led only to fiercer, more devastating fires. It was only when we realised that fires are a natural part of a forest ecosystem that we began to reduce the damage caused. Attempting to prevent any negative outcomes of a free market is similarly futile.<p>We can't control markets. Khruschev and Breshnev couldn't, nor Greenspan or Bernanke. All we can do is nudge it a little, build a firebreak here, drop a bucket there. Until we recognise that, we're doomed to the cycle of boom and bust that has dominated post-industrial economies.<p>People do stuff. You can attempt to change their incentives, but they'll still do whatever makes sense to them. That's the core of libertarian thought. Accept that lack of control, accept that the drug war can't be won, accept abortion and gambling and credit default swaps, then try and work out how best to mitigate the externalities of those things.

I was supposed to graduate as civil engineer.<p>Now I'm finally getting better, but it took several things:<p>1. Baby steps. Spring 2010 was the first time that I understood that taking less courses means that I have more energy per course. So I started with one, then two, then three. Now I have five ongoing courses at the same time, and I don't (quite) feel overwhelmed. My studies progressed last year at modest speed that is about 1/3 of the speed usually recommended, but my grades improved significantly.<p>2. Seeing psychologist. She told me about the benefits of taking it easy at first. And my friends didn't have to listen to all of my troubles.<p>3. Doing something really interesting. I switched to mechanics. I'm particularly into product development. I really don't seem to mind a single course that is not so interesting if it gets me closer my goal (this was actually  a big surprise to me).<p>4. No TV. But movies with friends is a big YES.<p>5. Getting good IRL friends. I don't feel the need to IRC anymore.<p>6. Clear shift between work and leisure. If I walk 800 meters to school and spend there 8 hours I can count that I get something done. I might check HN few times, but I just cannot browse the Internet for the whole day.<p>7. Might seem counterintuitive, but no work on Sundays. Jews we're right. Having at least one day a week when you just don't do anything productive can boost your productivity a lot. And it surprisingly helps to actually have really good time when you're not working, you might think that it drains your energy, but it doesn't.<p>8. I don't really know if it truly helps or not. But I often think about what I want in life, and how I'm going to get there fastest.<p>9. For some reason, it seems that getting older helps a little. Maybe it's because you get a stronger feeling about wasting your life.<p>10. There is no word ""should"". You either do, or you don't. Sometimes you might do something. Some stuff you haven't yet started, but it's stuff you're going to do, not something that you should do.<p>11. & 12. Make starting easy for yourself and plan what you're doing. I find it easiest to start by planning. So I plan what I do today and I actually start doing it tomorrow. Planning what I'm going to study tomorrow takes like 30min so it's not a biggie. I feel like I have started so it's easy to continue. And I get sense of control of what I do. Planning counts as doing!<p>13. Don't ever plan to grind through everything at one go. Those 14 hour work days are going to ruin your motivation to the next job.<p>14. Get a calendar and a clock. Use them. Then get completely rid of them when you have a day off.<p>Everything here actually just boils down to three things.

Something like a school case.<p>With this hypothesis which are general, balancing the tree (ak. Octree) is a hard misconception coming from BST.
It will be difficult to me to explain here why, but it's not really hard to see it.<p>Take this exemple and my hypothesis: you have a logarithmic distribution of points in 1D (but you don't know it particularly) and you are searching the points in random continuous ranges, then the best tree is a total unbalanced tree.

2984196,comment,2983884,2984120,9,0,SwellJoe,,,"I find it interesting that you use the recent home mortgage crisis as an example of market failure. Libertarians often use it as an example of governmental failure. Markets and governments were involved in the creation and fallout of the crisis...and people on either side want to blame the other. It's actually pretty analogous to the problem Eliezer pointed out about the balance of heredity vs. environment.<p>While the mortgage crisis would not have happened without market forces (+ human greed) and government involvement. The question becomes which of those factors we can alter or remove to make such an occurrence impossible in the future, rather than which factor to blame. From a pragmatic perspective, since we can't remove human greed, the other option is to not implement government programs that make it easier for millions of people who can't afford a house to get a mortgage.<p>So, more government might have prevented the problem, perhaps in the form of education programs for home buyers who only qualified because of the government programs. But, less government could have prevented the problem, as well, since the vast majority of those loans would have never happened without government programs to encourage them.<p>My instincts tell me to go the less expensive route, and let the market decide who can afford a house or not. If a bank knows the government isn't going to bail them out (as would be the case if these loans weren't government-backed), they're going to be more careful about who gets those loans.",1315761181

2984185,comment,2983884,2984120,1,0,jerf,,,"The market did not create the housing crisis. The government fiddled with the market all to hell, with the Community Reinvestment Act, the regulations surrounding the ratings agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's unmarket-like backings of loans, and a hodge-podge of other lesser interventions.<p>When the market was allowed to make decisions about who should get loans, the standards were a lot higher. But it wasn't ""right"" for people to have to put 20% down and have a very solid credit rating, because it discriminated against poor people (and Democratic voters), so the government fiddled until it produced the result it (thought it) wanted, forcing banks to lower mortgage standards until we eventually worked our way down to no-money down ARMs.<p>(BTW, the claim the government had nothing to do with it is to claim that all the regulation like the CRA and Fannie Mae and anti-discrimination all had absolutely no effect at all, in which one must answer the question, if regulations like that are so ineffectual that you can't lay any responsibility for the current crisis at their feet, then why do you think government regulations are the answer to anything? Either they are effective or they are not, but you can't flip back and forth depending on whether you <i>like</i> the effect or not.)<p>The problem is that people think of ""the market"" as a fundamental property, but in fact it is a <i>derived</i> property. The reason why the market tended to correctly allocate mortgages prior to the government's heavy-handed decades-long intervention is the incentive structure. Always look at the incentive structure. If my bank is going to issue me a mortgage, and the government leaves them alone, they are going to take a lot of steps to protect themselves, such as setting the requirements for your credit strength very high, and requiring large downpayments, and generally ensuring they aren't going to be left holding the bag when the mortgage falls through. Alternatively, if they're going to sell that risk, the receiving party is going to want the same due diligence. The government interventions basically systematically tore than incentive structure apart, by allowing them to just dump the mortgage off on Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac, by requiring them to make loans that they basically knew would fail but the government held guns to their head to do it, etc. If I had to pick one thing that really enabled the housing crisis, it was the ability to dump mortgages off on the FMs for what were in actuality above-market rates, then for the seller to be free-and-clear of the responsibilities. Other things may have accelerated it, but that structure guaranteed disaster on its own.<p>No, the market isn't ""always right"", but that's not really the question. <i>Nothing</i> is ""always right"". The question, which is more likely to be right, the market system or the government system? One of the big reasons I tend libertarian is that I empirically observe that the government almost inevitably creates incredibly broken incentive structures where the market <i>tends</i> to create ones that are much more connected to reality. In this particular case, the ""reality"" that the market is much more connected to is the question of ""will X be able to pay their mortgage back?"" I have to use the broad term ""reality"" when discussing it in general, but it actually comes back down to specifics like this.<p>One much also distinguish between ""the market"" being broken, and <i>reality</i> being ""broken"". Yes, mortgage requirements were quite high; that's because in reality it's a huge risk. It turns out the market wasn't broken here, and the efforts to ""fix"" it were the true brokenness.",1315760985

The larger the group, the more complex the system, the longer the system has been in place, the worst the results are. I don't think there is any intervention, nature or nurture, that would change this. To feel otherwise, to me, would be to say that there is a perfect person. That seems more than a little scary.

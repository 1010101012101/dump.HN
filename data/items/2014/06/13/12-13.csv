Two of the core topics are 1) the presence (or lack) of women in computer science / web development, and 2) the respect given to the women who <i>are</i> present.<p>Even if it was unintended, directing a question on an open board to &quot;gents&quot; suggests one of two things: 1) there are only men here; 2) even if there are women here, I&#x27;m not interested in their insights. The first is false (HN does have women, and would be improved with more). The second is disrespectful and would also lead to a poorer results set.<p>I&#x27;m sure there was no disrespect intended on your part. Indeed, I&#x27;d believe you were trying to make the question <i>more</i> respectful.<p>Either &quot;How do you make blueprints for your web application idea?&quot; or &quot;How should I make blueprints for my web application idea?&quot; would carry the exact same <i>intended</i> payload, while removing the gendered language issues.<p>As a follow-up to my earlier point, I&#x27;d really recommend the 37 Signals blog and the writings from Amy Hoy.

The data is simply mutated in place, for performance. The compiler knows in what order it has to update the datacells, so SolScript users don&#x27;t notice any of this. If I say `b = a`, then `a` will be calculated before `b` uses it. (If you want the value of `a` before `a` is updated, you say `b = previous a`.)<p>Ok.

It had 100% of the copier market and was insulated from competition by its patents. It was a large public company <i>monopoly</i>.<p>Google and Facebook, circa 2014, also aren&#x27;t your typical public companies. Google is protected from copying because they don&#x27;t ship a product. Their algorithms are hidden behind a web-API, and they are kept essentially as trade secrets. Facebook enjoys network effects, which provide protection from competition and in antitrust economics are considered a factor that gives rise to natural monopolies. E.g. the Microsoft and Offices monopolies were built on network effects.<p>It&#x27;s obvious why government-sanctioned monopolies, and government and university research labs are insulated from competition. It doesn&#x27;t matter if people copy their work, because they don&#x27;t need to make profits in the market in order to secure their funding.<p>I&#x27;m purposefully excluding start-ups and public and private companies that don&#x27;t enjoy substantial protection from copying and competition.

Which is to say that basically all alternatives to the dominant mode of private transportation—the one car per adult, drive yourself everwhere mode—are complements to one another. Uber makes much more sense in a city where lots of people don&#x27;t own cars than in a city where everyone owns one. And not owning a car makes more sense if your city has some walkable neighborhoods and good transit lines. But conversely, the availability of private-cars-for-hire on demand makes it much more plausible to imagine not making the large up-front investment in a car that would lead you to rely on a car for your baseline transportation needs.&quot;",1402662514

Since then I&#x27;ve sold my car and use subways, trains and my legs to get me to almost everywhere I need and once in a while I use a taxi or car service to get luggage somewhere or if it&#x27;s late and I just need to get home without subway hassle.<p>I&#x27;m deeply considering moving to the Bay Area for reasons I won&#x27;t go into here but I am really concerned that I will need to buy a car to survive.  I spent 10 days there recently and I clocked almost 4 hours a day on the road to various places.  In all fairness I had to commute in from up north (think Santa Rosa) for family reasons but I still had flash backs to my life in Los Angeles and the absolute necessity of having a car.<p>I’m doubtful that if I do move that I can find a commute to work as sweet as my current job.  I walk (by choice) about 9 blocks and subway 9 more and can make the entire trip in 22 minutes anytime of day I like regardless of other commuters.   In SF you have to consider traffic, bus overloading, being in just the right place at the right time to optimize your commute, or just buy a car or just use Uber and get there when you want on your schedule (still fighting traffic but that&#x27;s the driver&#x27;s problem).<p>Having grown up in Los Angeles I used to think SF public transportation was pretty advanced, but having lived in New York and the area here I realize trains, subways and the like are just much more effective here.  My uninformed guess is because trains where ingrained in the local culture investments in subway, commuter trains and the like where easier to justify.  In California the car was able to take hold early because of the sprawling nature of population distribution and since then it’s been near impossible to convince tax payers to build public transportation in face of all the other priorities for public tax dollars.<p>I think the “advent” of the electric car has made people feel they’re “doing the right thing” meanwhile it will not solve traffic issues and will only stall investment in public transportation by another fifty years.<p>I acknowledge the fact that many factors feed into transportation choices (Children, Luggage, Time, Schedules, Costs) but I also think underlying issues in a locality have a greater impact then individual choices.  Walt Disney and Ray Bradbury both tried to fight the “good fight” for years in Los Angeles proposing Monorail systems and you can see where they managed to get.<p>To condemn individuals who use Uber and Lyft is like treating the symptom rather then curing the disease.  Until we have real plans to make better transportation options available to the public they will continue to solve their daily problems using their own resources however they feel meets their needs.

Improved cab service, it was claimed, would let people get rid of their own cars and begin using more convenient, more sustainable modes of transit for most things, resorting to a now more reliable taxi service as a crutch when necessary.<p>Taxi industry bullshit?

Let&#x27;s assume such routes can be only 25% longer than normal routes , on average[2].<p>Combine both of those, we can replace 6X30 minutes car trips , with a single 37.5 minute suv trip, which will be charged $21.87 for 6 passengers, or $3.64 per person.<p>If we wanted to have a similar trip in public transportation, it would probably take around 1.5-2 hours , but might cost $2.<p>And if we compare this to a normal car trip, the uber experience could be much better - you could watch a tv episode on your tablet after a long work day and unwind, instead of the stress of fighting traffic.

Out of necessity, most users must place software usability and capability above ideology. Software like Firefox OS and Persona will never see serious adoption when they can&#x27;t compete with long-established and more functional offerings at the most basic levels, even if these competitors may not be as &quot;open&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s an approach that doesn&#x27;t work for Mozilla&#x27;s offerings that are already well-established, either. Firefox has been hemorrhaging users ever since its developers stopped focusing on truly improving the user experience, and instead focused solely on copying the worst aspects of Chrome (the UI, for example), while neglecting to address the performance and resource usage problems that have long plagued Firefox.<p>Users need software that works. If that means using software that&#x27;s &quot;less open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot;, they&#x27;ll do it without a second thought. Mozilla just happens to often be on the losing side of this reality these days. While &quot;openness&quot; can be beneficial, it needs to be in conjunction with software that&#x27;s at least comparably good to its &quot;closed&quot; competitors. Firefox OS, Persona and Firefox are good examples of where this isn&#x27;t the case, and how they&#x27;re either seeing limited to no adoption, or how they&#x27;re losing existing users.",1402661031

MUNI couldn&#x27;t manage its way out of a wet paper bag, AC Transit tackles increasing ridership by replacing transbay buses with smaller capacity local buses. To get anything done you have to organize across 30+ agencies. Lack of investment in the public infrastructure verses the increasing population. The list goes on...<p>2) People want public transit just not in their back yard. Witness the central subway debacle of it not going all the way to North Beach/Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf. Witness Marin voting not to extend BART to their cities. Witness the Marin SMART line first phase not ending at the Larkspur ferry terminal. Witness the high speed rail link mess and the fact that it&#x27;s impossible to take a train from San Francisco to Sacramento without having to transit through about 3 different systems.<p>So it&#x27;s no wonder that companies are running their own buses or people are looking to alternative services like Uber or Lyft because it&#x27;s their only option for getting around, and as a wise man once said &quot;There ain&#x27;t no getting &#x27;round getting &#x27;round&quot;",1402660928

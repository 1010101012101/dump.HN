6120740,comment,6112683,6113065,1,0,DanielStraight,,,"The entire point of religious views is to provide another way of understanding reality.<p>You presumably believe that science alone can explain reality. And that&#x27;s fine. But many people don&#x27;t, and I&#x27;m not just talking about the traditionally religious.<p>Scientifically, the &quot;love&quot; we have for our children is simply a genetically-programmed strategy for best ensuring that our genes are passed to future generations. It has no meaning.<p>In fact, scientifically, <i>nothing</i> has any meaning. Whether we live or die makes no difference at all, and when someone kills another, the only reason it&#x27;s &quot;wrong&quot; is because society is trying to preserve itself so that individuals can pass on their genes to the next generation.<p>Again, if you&#x27;re OK with this, that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m not going to try to make you change your mind. But hopefully you can understand why others, many others, inform their view of reality with sources other than science.",1375102796

6120683,comment,6119673,6119673,30,0,riahi,,,"Probably not going to get seen in this morass of comments, but I went back and reviewed the CMS data that the article cites.<p>The article used the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) 238 - Major Cardiovascular Procedures without Major Complications.  This is the best guess at capturing the costs of &quot;Open Heart Surgery&quot;.  (CMS only releases data for the top 100 DRG codes).  &quot;Open Heart Surgery&quot; is a term for a variety of surgical procedures done on the heart, including valve replacement, vascular repairs of the aorta/vena cava/pulmonary vessels, and coronary bypass.  These span a wide variety of DRG codes, including 216-221 for valve replacement, 228 (other cardiothoracic procedures with major complications), and 231-236 for cardiac bypass.  Assuming we are comparing the operation known as coronary bypass grafting, then 238 is a decent enough code to use, with the proviso that it&#x27;s not the best source for data.<p>Looking at the numbers claimed:  If you download the Excel file from CMS [1], you can sort by DRG and Provider Name.  Yes, if you search by DRG 238 and filter by Cleveland Clinic you will get $106,385 charged to Medicare.  However, what the article completely leaves out (and anyone in medical practice will assume) is that Medicare simply does not pay the amount covered.  Average Total Payments by Medicare:  $26,898.  That&#x27;s how much Cleveland Clinic gets reimbursed, on average, by Medicare for any procedure included in DRG 238.<p>It gets more interesting when you include all providers and sort by average total payments.  The highest average Medicare reimbursement to anyone for DRG 238 is $54,682; the lowest $13,233.  Another interesting example:<p>In Alabama, at Brookwood Medical Center, DRG 238 covers $111,008 and only reimburses $15,552.<p>These comparisons of the US system to outside countries really need to compare average US reimbursement to their stated cost, because they sure aren&#x27;t funding an army of administrators to get the insurance companies to pay up.<p>In summary, you can get &quot;open heart surgery&quot; in the US (Alabama) for &quot;$15,552&quot;.  I wonder what the Alabama price is if you walk in and offer to pay cash.  If you can get it at the Medicare reimbursement rate, that compares decently to the Indian price.<p>[1]  <a href=""http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Inpatient.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Stat...</a>",1375102252

It&#x27;s not like there aren&#x27;t other examples of dense filters in the working world. We just aren&#x27;t very honest about it with our trainees.<p>The other thing we fail at as academics is helping trainees understand and take advantage of non-academic tracks after grad school, without attaching a stigma of failure to them. There are many, many ways to succeed, have a rewarding and exciting career, and contribute to society as a non-academic with a graduate degree... not to mention the higher salaries! Too many academics treat their trainees as failures if they even initiate this conversation. It needs to stop.<p>Imagine if students entering med school, who wanted to be pediatric neurosurgeons, for example (sub-sub-speciality requiring many post-med school years of study) found out at the end of all their training, at age 35 or 40, that oops, perhaps only 25% of them will ever get the job they want?",1375102219

The Nanded hospital he describes below serves 1,400 villages, about 2.3 million people, with just 9 surgeons (Gawande says that&#x27;d be comparable to the state of Kansas having 9 surgeons):<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/0312427654"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0312427654</a><p>note: <i>It&#x27;s a little OT, but I guess it&#x27;s an interesting anecdote because it talks about how absolutely significant surgical innovation (not just, &quot;good for the India masses&quot;) can occur in desperate situations. I have no idea if that applies to the state of the art of heart surgery in India.</i><p>------------<p>Among the many distressing things I saw in Nanded, one was the incredible numbers of patients with perforated ulcers. In my eight years of surgical training, I had seen only one patient with an ulcer so severe that the stomachs acid had eroded a hole in the intestine. But Nanded is in a part of the country where people eat intensely hot chili peppers, and patients arrived almost nightly with the condition, usually in severe pain and going into shock after the hours of delay involved in traveling from their villages.<p>The only treatment at that point is surgical. A surgeon must take the patient to the operating room urgently, make a slash down the middle of the abdomen, wash out all the bilious and infected fluid, find the hole in the duodenum, and repair it. This is a big and traumatic operation, and often these patients were in no condition to survive it. So Motewar did a remarkable thing. He invented a new operation: a laparoscopic repair of the ulcerous perforation, using quarter-inch incisions and taking an average of forty-five minutes.<p>When I later told colleagues at home about the operation, they were incredulous. It did not seem possible. Motewar, however, had mulled over the ulcer problem off and on for years and became convinced he could devise a better treatment. His department was able to obtain some older laparoscopic equipment inexpensively. An assistant was made personally responsible for keeping it clean and in working order. And over time, Motewar carefully worked out his technique.<p>I saw him do the operation, and it was elegant and swift. He even did a randomized trial, which he presented at a conference and which revealed the operation to have fewer complications and a far more rapid recovery than the standard procedure. In that remote, dust-covered town in Maharashtra, Motewar and his colleagues had become among the most proficient ulcer surgeons in the world.",1375101617

Quality content and discussion, not gaining karma points should be the focus. Keep the number internal.

Doctors are supposed to be very smart, but they&#x27;re apparently unable to write down some sort of bullet point list or short paragraph about the state of a patient for the next person coming in? Good programmers document their code. The equivalent goes for doctors, too.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem like you care much about it (&quot;scientific research&quot;), but IMO it&#x27;s much more likely to put programs in place to help doctors learn basic literacy/documentation skills than to subvert the basic biological truth that staying up for as long as most medical students/residents/etc are forced to do puts them in a state equivalent to drunk driving.

Also if you don&#x27;t have enough doctors? Maybe you should start training more of them, instead of artificially limiting supply. (Residency placement slots are a whole other issue, of course, but still not something that should stymie a first world country so.)<p>I&#x27;ve had way too much experience with rude, sleepy, and grumpy residents who bungled my medical care in the last two years of frequent ER and inpatient stays to have much trust in the profession as a whole. I mean, if you&#x27;re going to charge me $50,000 for your crappy medical care, could you at least not snap at me? Or forget me in an observatory room for over 12 hours waiting for a scan? They &quot;lost&quot; me in the system somehow until a nurse wondered why I&#x27;d been sitting there so long, called radiology, and left the room to bitch them out about forgetting me. Since the doctors couldn&#x27;t be bothered to tell me what they were checking for, I only found out 13 or so hours later that the scan was to rule out a carotid artery dissection. I was in extreme pain the whole time, which they did nothing to even try to alleviate. Incredible lack of empathy.<p>I&#x27;m glad to hear that your hospital has gone to at least trying to adhere to reasonable shift limits; it&#x27;s a sign that at least some people in some hospital systems have decided that policies leading to killing or crippling patients is something that should be prevented, not encouraged.

They seem in all cases to be organizations of human beings with the capacity to concentrate and assert power over other human beings.</i><p>The difference is in the use, origin and organization of such &quot;capacity&quot;. Which makes all the difference in the world.<p>For one, state power comes from elections and laws passed by elected representatives of the majority. Corporate and private interest power on the other hand is arbitrary.<p>Second, the democratic state (however imperfect) was founded to serve the people. And in most cases it was founded BY the people, through bloody struggles against opressors (feudalism, colonial powers, the King, etc). Corporate and private interest power on the other hand is self serving.<p>To put it in another way, &quot;private interests&quot; amount to a dictatorial state (or, to be more presice, to a constellation of dictatorial regions of control). Something people fight to get rid of, and establish democratic states.<p>><i>The difference seems to be in the scale and scope of that concentration and assertion of power.</i><p>Private interests, if left unguarded, can drawf states in scale and scope (and have done so, in tons of historical examples, especially for less powerful countries.

In particular I wonder if patching Scintilla and Lua is really necessary...<p>About opening files and navigating buffers: I must have been a very naive Emacs user because I didn&#x27;t really miss anything basic. I open files by typing the file name, with tab completion. I switch to buffers in two ways: if I have only 2 or 3 buffers, I advance between them; if I have more, I jump between them by typing portions of their their names. To navigate inside a buffer all I use are motions by character, word, line, paragraph, page; jumping to matching parenthesis, bracket or brace; incremental search; jumping to line numbers. All of this is present in Textadept, so I felt the basics were covered. (I am sure that more expert Emacs users will definitely find lots to miss in Textadept.)<p>Indenting of course is much more primitive in Textadept, that&#x27;s definitely true. I&#x27;m used to indenting manually (well, not totally manually: having each newline start with the indentation of the previous one and then adding or removing indentation using tab and S-tab), from using other non-Emacs editors and esoteric languages for which no Emacs mode had been written at the time, so I didn&#x27;t mind that much.<p>The first thing I really missed was eval-last-sexp, so I quickly wrote a basic substitute (since Lua doesn&#x27;t have those easy to match parenthesis around everything, I evaluate either the selection or, if empty, the whole line; that works for me). I have the Lua code evaluated in an environment where the usual print function inserts text in the buffer instead of writing to stdout.",1375100118

Who cares about Bootstrap when people are throwing bananas at a minister in the Italian government because she&#x27;s black?<p>* People don&#x27;t seem to get that you can compartmentalize: I care deeply about politics, but I also like having a high quality tech site that is about tech and startups.  On these threads, people say that if I don&#x27;t want politics on HN, I must not care about politics at all.  Couldn&#x27;t be farther from the truth.  I also love to follow professional cycling, but I don&#x27;t want politics on those sites either.<p>* Way more people care about politics than the stuff that makes HN HN.  If we open the floodgates, it will attract lots of people who will dilute the site.  As noted elsewhere, I think this is something of a feedback loop.<p>* I don&#x27;t like the divisiveness of the subject.  There are frequent posters here who have said they are Republicans, and given their statements on religion, maybe they&#x27;re even in favor of <i>$a_very_divisive_issue</i>.

You can find the same topics discussed all over the internet, in every language.<p>* I think that the site has been &quot;holed below the waterline&quot; by the NSA stuff and the subsequent flood of articles, as well as the &quot;outrage&quot; articles about various grave injustices.

It add a free ""feature"" to your website<p>- Don't repeat the Help / Login at the bottom. It's confusing for me. Everybody is used to logged from the top right corner or somewhere in the middle of the page. Not the bottom left corner ;)<p>- Keep the basic color of the sharing icon. your color scheme doesn't do them justice :) Also, For instance, your Twitter is all blurry after your modified it<p>- For your Sign-up process. If you want to add more ""sharing/social"" feature, it is maybe best to be able to sign-up through Facebook/twitter connect too.<p>- remove the credit cards logo under the Buy now button. They are not very nice looking and just use the basic Paypal button. Everybody know that you can pay through a bazillion ways through Paypal :)  And by seeing the Paypal name they are reassured you are not a ""scammy little website""<p>- Your recipes, batches and ingredients pages look a bit empty. Just add the footer like you did on the about page to promote.<p>Otherwise I like the design and process of your website, About the idea I don't know, I'm just not into brewing myself :)<p>cheers!",1301396385

2382053,comment,2381538,2381538,2,0,ScottWhigham,,,"I don't understand why you would limit yourself to just doing an ebook. If it's such a great book, why cut out a huge chunk of your market (those who do not want/like ebooks)? It seems like it would be trivial to convert an ebook to a printed book.<p>By choosing the ebook route, I think you also cut your profits massively. This is just my own opinion/feelings so I may not be aligned with how others view it, but I don't value an ebook the same way I do a paper book. I won't pay the same, for example. I expect to pay 25% less at a minimum.<p>If your book does what you say it does (""describes solutions to business intelligence software problems (namely, prediction)""), then I'd think the lowest I'd consider for a printed copy would be $60 and the highest I'd think for a printed copy would be $400. Settling on somewhere in the middle is tough but I'd probably choose $75 and start with that.<p>But this is an ebook. I'm not paying $75 for an ebook. I'd pay $40 though.",1301393538

I guess Government is just accustomed to providing 'help' and generally interfering when actually they can be more useful by withdrawing.<p>One thing I'd add is that Government could make it easier for people to live on lower income. For instance, raising the nil band of income tax which they seem to be working on but it feels like that's more Lib Dem pressure. The Cons seem to just want to talk about the 50% tax rate, which means nothing to me. This will become more important as interest rates rise and those with mortgages are further squeezed.",1301392958

Likely the best they could do is throw <i>a lot</i> of cores at the problem (enter Oracle&#x27;s T-5 SPARC).

Given that the author fails in getting into a conversation with the inmates, I find it irksome he feels called to pontificate on the situation, especially when other author have succeeded in having discussions with both gang members and alleged-but-not-actual gang members.<p>I suspect the inmates were wise in not talking to him. Since gang membership is a means that the California Prison System can use to discipline an inmate with little evidence, it&#x27;s in the system&#x27;s interest to describe everyone as a gang member (with Pelican Bay being the punishment zone for anyone so accused). Naturally, extreme insecurity makes banding logical as well - however the questionable part of the discussion is whether the prison is trying to control gang membership (in the same fashion that its questionable whether the war drugs is an honest effort to control drug use).",1410987406

Multiple spreadsheet companies (like Lotus, for instance), multiple Word processors and the like.  Over time, Microsoft Acquired or drove out of business much of the competition by aggregating all of these functions into a coherent office suite.<p>This time around, companies like Github are &quot;liberating&quot; key functionality via acquisition.  I think some of these things will end up like atom -- open source projects that play a key role in githubs core business (yes, I expect atom to replace the in-browser editor on github, so that&#x27;s the assumption I&#x27;m working on here)... while others will be like the extra businesses that Github runs on the side.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is bad, since Easel was acquired by github...

8332291,comment,8330078,8330078,1,0,graycat,,,"Nice visualization of an application of simulated annealing.<p>We should keep in mind that the OP is doing the traveling salesman problem (TSP) in the plane.  So we should recall the nice Karp result in about 1972:  With meager assumptions on the probability distribution of the cities, for any number x, no matter how small, as the number of cities n goes to infinity, there is a simple approach that will come within x% of optimality with probability 1 - x.<p>This simple approach?  Start by connecting the cities with a minimum spanning tree.  Then for the TSP tour, just traverse the spanning tree except going directly to the next city in the tree traversal not already visited.  That is, when following the tree would cause visiting a city a second time, just go directly, not following an arc in the tree, to the next city in the tree traversal not yet visited.<p>So intuitively the value is, for large n, get about as close, about as often as wish, and for small n just enumerate!<p>Intuitively what is going on is that one of the main challenges is identifying the appropriate <i>clusters</i> of cities and, then, connecting the clusters, and the minimum spanning tree tends to find the right clusters.<p>Of course, there are at least two algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees, and as I recall both run in time proportional to n^2.  So, we have a polynomial algorithm that is, for large n, for TSP in the plane, as close as we please.<p>For the &quot;plane&quot;, I meant R^2, where R is the set of real numbers, that is, ordinary Euclidean 2-space.  But Karp&#x27;s approach also works the same in R^m for any positive integer m.",1410987086

As far as I can remember, the key was a bit more than that, but I&#x27;m sure it was including this part.<p>At the end of every iteration (of something involving this loop which I can&#x27;t precisely recall now) the program checks whether it is running under debug mode (essentially makes a PTRACE call and reads its output, the OP also talks about it) If this is the case, it makes a jump to random address, so even if you are just neatly watching the program run under debug mode, you weren&#x27;t going to achieve anything.<p>The next thing that occured to me is to manipulate how PTRACE returns its value, but I thought it would involve some kernel code fiddling and running the program under the modified kernel, which is WAY beyond my ability for now. I didn&#x27;t know how to do it, but later by some very stupid trick I managed to pass this decryption part and the program made a jump to something like &quot;__glibc_start&quot;. I needed to save the altered program and run it under gdb again (I don&#x27;t remember why), but I was using the trial version of IDA Pro which prohibits me of such a thing. After making a few more desperate attempts I gave up.<p>But this &quot;using the code as the key&quot;.. I think spending 14 hours to see this done was well worth it.",1410986754

For example:<p><pre><code>  &quot;The International Sweeteners Association (ISA) says it strongly\n   refutes the claims made in the study: &#x27;There is a broad body of\n   scientific evidence which clearly demonstrates that low-calorie\n   sweeteners are not associated with an increased risk of obesity\n   and diabetes as they do not have an effect on appetite, blood\n   glucose levels or weight gain.&#x27;&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s true that artificial sweeteners have no immediate effect on appetite, blood glucose levels, nor weight gain. None of these are claims made by the study. Everyone is refuting the immediate effects of artificial sweeteners. The study claims that <i>after</i> consuming artificial sweeteners, if you then consume something naturally sweet, the prior consumption of an artificial sweetener alters your glucose tolerance levels.<p>It&#x27;s the equivalent of saying that removing all the trees from around rivers has no effect on fish population because clearly fish don&#x27;t live in trees.

If the study is correct, take one group of people who use diet soft drinks with an overall healthy diet and compare it to another group of people who consume the same overall healthy diet but drink water instead of diet soft drinks, and the group that drinks water should have a better glucose tolerance response than the diet soft drink group.",1410986413

CAT is advertising based on a list of personally identifiable information about your &quot;targets&quot; that you supply, which can include user IDs, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, etc. I can&#x27;t confirm but suspect no limit is required for this since you already have their personal data.<p>As an aside, an interesting use of this system I&#x27;ve seen in the Internet marketing world is to buy e-mail or phone number lists from list vendors and use them to create custom audiences in Facebook. You can&#x27;t e-mail them because that&#x27;s spam and you&#x27;ll be busted very quickly, but using them as fodder for custom audiences on platforms like Facebook is a way of laundering the info, in a sense.

And note the <i>architecture</i> of the code didn&#x27;t actually change, this isn&#x27;t one of those cases where the second version was also radically different than the first so no comparison is possible, it was actually hard to implement in Erlang. Erlang is a very klunky language to work in. Raw Java might be klunkier, but it&#x27;s easily the klunkiest of the languages I use.<p>Erlang&#x27;s clustering, which my code heavily depends on, just sort of breaks sometimes, on machines that are on the same switch, with every bit of hardware switched out over time. It is very opaque to figure out why it isn&#x27;t working, or how to make it work again. Mnesia breaks even more often on loads that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. After 7 years of working with it, at this point <i>even if</i> the solution was just to turn on this one flag somewhere and all my problems would go away, I still would not consider that a positive.<p>I don&#x27;t &quot;hate&quot; it, but I&#x27;ve been waiting for years for a more conventional language that had pervasive microthreading in it that I could use for work. Go is not <i>quite</i> it... I&#x27;d still like the goroutines to be completely isolated, and I&#x27;ve got a handful of other quibbles... but it&#x27;s close enough that I might be able to get out of the hell of trying to multiprocess in most other languages, while being something I might actually be able to get adopted. In general, the company I work for has not been overwhelmed by the effectiveness of Erlang.<p>In practice, the biggest loss of fundamental capability is loss of true asynchronous exceptions, and, well... in practice that&#x27;s only an annoyance, not an OH MY GOSH I WILL NEVER USE A LANGUAGE WITHOUT ASYNCHRONOUS EXCEPTIONS sort of thing. In most cases if you&#x27;re throwing an async exception you&#x27;ve really already lost and now we&#x27;re just discussing exactly how you&#x27;re losing.<p>Every language student should study Erlang, and learn from it, and possibly use it. It&#x27;s a solid language. And there&#x27;s nothing wrong with trying to port some of that solidity elsewhere. (I&#x27;d pick a real DB over Mnesia, though.)",1410985510

8332155,comment,8331474,8332092,24,0,jonnathanson,,,"Indeed. I think it helps to unpack the various claims being studied:<p>1) Carcinogenicity. Do certain sweeteners cause harmful mutations and increase cancer risk? This is one of the oldest and most frequent allegations, especially against saccharin and aspartame. Mostly inconclusive, though both sweeteners have been exonerated at least as often as they&#x27;ve been accused.<p>2) Insulin triggering. Artificial sweeteners may not bear the caloric load of sugars and starches -- but do they trigger the release of insulin, just the same? Again, the jury is still out, but certain sweeteners (aspartame, sucralose, and possibly saccharin) are looking suspect.<p>3) Caloric load. Some sweeteners and putatively indigestible molecules (sugar alcohols, &quot;resistant starches,&quot; etc.) may contain more <i>effective</i> calories than in vitro studies predict them to contain. This is because the chemicals aren&#x27;t digested in the traditional sense, but are fermented and absorbed in the gut. Caloric bioavailability is often different from nominal calorie count. (Indeed, this is the entire principle behind the supposed benefits of resistant sweeteners and starches; those benefits may have been overstated or misunderstood).<p>4) Disruption or adverse selection of gut microbiota. As detailed in this study. While not all sweeteners have been implicated here, this field of study is only just kicking into high gear. It seems reasonable to suspect that molecules fermented by / consumed by gut bacteria could have <i>some</i> effect on flora composition. Many sweeteners fit that criterion.<p>5) Other toxicities. Liver or kidney toxicity, neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption, etc. As with carcinogenicity, the jury is still out. Unlikely for some sweeteners that are not metabolized via these pathways. Possible for others. Most sweeteners (all?) on the market right now are generally recognized as safe in this respect, despite popular beliefs to the contrary. Notable exceptions exist for those with rare metabolic or genetic disorders, such as phenylketonuria (aspartame contains phenylalanine).<p>6) Side effects. Some sweeteners, particularly those in the sugar alcohol family (and sorbitol especially), can cause laxative effects and other GI-related issues. Individual tolerance can vary. Breaking this category out from #4 because the action here can be purely mechanical (i.e., increasing intestinal water absorption).<p>I&#x27;m not a doctor or medical researcher myself.

All apps assume they can do whatever they want in the background, without being shut down.

We can barely even correlate a single given feature of your gut as being related to, say, obesity.  (My partner spent some time in a lab asking this precise question; I will, if I can get a source, give some sort of paper link when I get home from work)  There&#x27;s a lot of fad science around diet and microflora nowadays, but the sense I get as an observer of someone who is in that field, it&#x27;s about as wishy washy as if you asked a computer scientist &quot;what are the leading causes of disk failure.&quot;  We know that if you shove a screwdriver through it it won&#x27;t be happy, but there&#x27;s still tons of debate about the finer points.  (And your gut is WAY more complex than a HDD).<p>So, takeaway from this ramble, do what your body responds well to, and keep to generally &quot;good patterns&quot; of hygene and balanced diet.  Anecdotally, and from many practicing physicians, this tends to work out &quot;ok&quot; in the long run.",1410984184
8332079,comment,8328589,8328589,3,0,davidgerard,,,"WELL I NEVER, See I Told You, Morning Commuter Time (NNN) — British scientists have uncovered why little girls like pink toys. “Women are hardwired to like pink,” says Professor Gene Hunt of the University of Metro, “because their cavewoman foremothers spent their days gathering red leaves and berries amongst the trees.” Later, women needed to notice red-faced babies and blushing boyfriends. Men are attracted to blue because of the colour of the sky as seen when hunting.<p>Women are also predisposed to backstab one another in the workplace and cry in the boardroom, just like the social structures in the cave population as extrapolated from these two bone needles. Being too successful will increase women’s testosterone, giving them hairy nipples and male-pattern baldness. Females joining the hunt may also explain the end of the Neanderthals.<p>IQ test studies show that women have lower IQs on average than men, undoubtedly from lesser need for environmental variation while taking care of the cave. Tests on little boys prove that testosterone correlates with a sense of humour, which is why women just can’t take a joke. Housework has been shown to cut the risk of several fatal diseases, and dressing up nicely around the house is psychologically healthy as it uses the Homo erectus clan maintenance abilities of the female of the tribe.<p>Men are naturally predisposed to sleep with as many women as possible, as proven by lions, whereas women are naturally predisposed to stay loyal to their man and their spawn. Women who sleep around are at increased risk of parasites and death, as proven by cheetahs, who are a pack of catty sluts.<p>In a final crowning achievement, the team has shown that daily fellatio greatly reduces the incidence of breast cancer. Furthermore, regular sexual intercourse is essential to feminine health, but may be injurious if prolonged for more than two minutes or conducted while the man is sober.<p>“In conclusion,” says Professor Hunt, “all of this is top-notch science that you can absolutely rely on. Now get your knickers back on and make me a cuppa.”<p>from <a href=""http://newstechnica.com/2008/10/23/science-reveals-evolutionary-origins-of-gender-stereotypes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newstechnica.com/2008/10/23/science-reveals-evolution...</a>",1410984177

I had a sweet tooth once and it took about a couple of years to even not being able to tolerate it. The weak find excuses, the strong adapt and improve. Just reject anything with refined sugar or fancy new &quot;healthier&quot; sweeteners - do you like sugar more than tomorrow? Cane sugar is not healthier than HCFS (it might be just slightly less harmful). Agave &quot;Nectar&quot; actually has significantly more fructose than HCFS... and it&#x27;s not unprocessed as claimed, and so on.

UI/UX<p>2) Reduce the number of things humans have to do. While all modern hardware can calculate the same things (are universal) they have different security models which can affect how much maintenance the user has to do. Take capability based security, an old idea implemented in hardware in the IBM AS 400. Languages (E, Joe-E) based on it are currently being touted as a way to reduce the risk of malware infection, even if malware does get on the system it can't do much because the language VMs operate under a principle of least privilege.<p>If we are changing the Arch for performance (e.g. fleet) and can't make use of the performance with standard software we may want to change it in this way as well, to take advantage of the system.<p>To give a concrete example of how computer architectures can be changed for the better. If windows had capability based security at the low level it could pass  bits of memory to the user land process by sharing a capability that gave it write access. Then the user land process could populate it, once it had finished and the kernel wanted to read it, they could revoke the the writeable permission.

Yes this is mainly an AI problem, but it also an architecture problem.

Which programs are allowed to try and manage the graphics card drivers, how can the user communicate what she wants in terms of graphics card drivers in a way that the computer will find unambiguous.<p>So yep, UI and UX, is important but it is only one possibly angle of attack, and not the one I'm interested in.

And you'll still be paying access fees to a gateway, or have you found a way around that?<p>As for your 'theoretical fines', the two biggest instances that I remember wrecked the companies involved, the first one involved a company called Dacotah Marketing and Research, one of the largest internet billing companies during the .com boom, the second involved iBill.com, which you could probably qualify as their successor.<p>Both of these companies offered 'third party billing', which is one thing you are at least staying away from.<p>But if VISA doesn't care about blowing 10K+ merchants to kingdom come by fining an IPSP that does not abide by their rules out of existence, you certainly are not going to be felt any more than a gnat would be felt if a car ran over it.<p>They <i>really</i> don't care about individual merchants at VISA or MC, and to work with a large to mid sized IPSP will have a significant advantage in that effectively you are bundling your negotiation powers against the card issuers.<p>This will help during acceptance, charge back issues, merchant account revocation for some imaginary sleight and so on (you <i>did</i> check if you have permission to run those logos, did you get it in writing?).<p>Last but not least, working through an IPSP rather than 'rolling your own', no matter how satisfying is that you get the benefit of a large pool of knowledge on scrubbing and pre-authorization checks to make sure that your customer is legit.

There is only so much time.<p>I also don't make my own computer chips, circuit boards, and so on. I've found it to be un-economical to do so and the same logic is what stops me from rolling my own billing solution.<p>Incidentally, I'm the original author of 'webpay', the software that powered the first major IPSP, so it's not as though I wouldn't have an idea where to start, but some things require a whole lot more dedication than I'm willing to spend on it to do it right.<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/19980507122555/http://mattheij.nl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/19980507122555/http://mattheij.nl...</a><p>cheers!<p>edit: afterthought, you may be talking cross purposes when you compare the $150K that Hearland might be fined to the most common kind of fine, the chargeback penalty.

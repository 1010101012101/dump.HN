For Objective-C, you&#x27;ll probably do better with PLCrashReporter (or possibly KSCrash) which can reliably unwind at the time of the crash because of certain assumptions it can make about ObjC binaries that the more general Breakpad does not make. (Breakpad just captures the stacks to a minidump, which you then unwind later using symbol files generated from your binaries.)<p><i>you usually need to allocate a piece of memory in the heap</i><p>Breakpad preallocates. The ObjC (Mac, iOS) handler included with Breakpad (should you go that route) goes so far as to mprotect the preallocated memory to help protect it from memory smashers.<p>None of this is perfect, but I&#x27;d rather have stack traces than not.

10922564,comment,10913072,10913072,0,0,crdb,,,"I would caution against reading too much in departures of Rocket managers.<p>First, Rocket managers come and go all the time. In my first two years at one of the Asian Rocket companies (I own no Rocket stock today and am not affiliated with anything Rocket anymore), I think I counted 4-5 CEOs. Since I left, it&#x27;s been the same CEO, though. The key thing is that the Samwer brothers have designed their companies to be resilient to any departures; &quot;people should be replaceable&quot; which sucks a bit when you are &quot;people&quot; but is good corporate governance when you are a publicly traded company trusted with billions of dollars. I&#x27;m pretty sure from what I saw that this also applied to Berlin; and since we&#x27;re shortly after the IPO (and maybe the start of the period where executives are allowed to liquidate their equity?) it might be that those who culturally were more comfortable in a privately owned conglomerate are not enjoying the public version. It&#x27;s also common for senior executives to be poached for more money by smaller Rockets, CMOs are in particularly high demand and managing directors find it relatively easier to raise funding and start their own thing (e.g. Shopback in Singapore).<p>Second, there are a LOT of Rocket companies. Some are very successful, others are case studies in problems. Just look at the map: <a href=""https://www.rocket-internet.com/companies"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.rocket-internet.com/companies</a> and imagine that each of these countries will have at least three companies (one fashion retailer, one Amazon clone, and one of several of the smaller concepts like Birchbox or FoodPanda). There are hundreds of companies operating in vastly different countries, legal systems, business models. I&#x27;d be wary of extrapolating too much from one or two examples - it&#x27;s like picking a few YC failures (and I am sure there are spectacular ones, just from the sheer number of companies funded - HomeJoy is the most prominent in my head right now) and saying YC as a whole has failed as an incubator.<p>Third, Rocket is relatively operationally decentralised. Yes, the Samwers visit often, but companies are ultimately left alone to figure things out, even if insights are occasionally emailed around, and even if Berlin has some R&D and obviously runs the financial and legal aspect. I would doubt that Berlin departures would significantly impact the operations of non-Berlin-based companies (which is to say most of them).<p>> The stock was down another 0.2 percent on Tuesday, to 23.33 euros at 1330 GMT, valuing the company at about 3.9 billion euros ($4.2 billion).<p>I&#x27;ve always found these short term stock price tidbits fairly useless. What is more interesting is the long term trend (from a peak of 57 EUR down to 19 EUR) [1] which is strangely not mentioned in the article. Nevertheless, I used to be fairly critical of how the Samwers were running their conglomerate, but thinking back about it, I&#x27;m not sure I would do much better. How would you go about starting 200 companies in parallel in 40 countries? I do not know any other examples of even remotely successful attempts...<p>[1] <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=RKET.F+Interactive#{&quot;range&quot;:&quot;max&quot;,&quot;allowChartStacking&quot;:true}"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=RKET.F+Interactive#{&quot;rang...</a>",1453092317

Most of the positives for Ubuntu come from Debian. The Ubuntu specific stuff on the other hand sometimes breaks core functionality like booting off software RAID being broken in 12.x, which has worked fine in Debian for at least a decade.<p>Generally speaking, a server environment is not the right place to run bleeding edge software. Debian&#x27;s conservatism is quite sensible when it comes to production server environments, and traditionally (before the whole systemd debacle) they were pretty good at prioritizing stability over the feature of the week demanded by more desktop-centric folks. There&#x27;s Ubuntu and other derivatives that can cater to their specific needs without compromising the integrity of the distribution in general. And if you have a specific application that requires a more recent version, you can always make use of a 3rd party repository (that you&#x27;d of course have carefully vetted first), a binary package, or just rolling your own from source. It makes much more sense to take those extra steps for specific applications than take a blanket approach to rolling out new code all over your production environment.",1453092190

No? Well then it means you don&#x27;t need <i>any</i> job, but rather you are in a hurry to select <i>some</i> job that still meets certain minimum criteria.<p>You probably at least require that the job pays well enough for you to support yourself, and maybe others too, and that the job offers you access to affordable medical, dental, and life insurance. You probably also expect the job to have some range of regular hours, approximately 40-50 hours working per week, with an expectation that you do not usually need to work overtime or on weekends.<p>You probably also require that while you&#x27;re working, you are shielded from dangerous situations (e.g. you&#x27;re not writing code while dangling from a helicopter, and there&#x27;s not a hole in the roof over your desk, ...).<p>This is <i>a lot of stuff</i> that you require. In fact, out of the space of all possible jobs, you&#x27;re actually looking for jobs that fit into an extremely tiny niche.<p>These things just happen to be the most common norms around employment in the developed world. We don&#x27;t have to negotiate as hard for them now, and you know why? <i>Because people in the past negotiated extremely hard for them, and refused to take &#x27;no&#x27; for an answer, and led strikes, lock-ins, demonstrations, bargaining agreements, and political diplomacy in order to secure either laws or strong social norms to protect these things.</i><p>When those people approached employment, they didn&#x27;t say, well, I&#x27;m a beggar with few options, so I had better subject myself to anti-human treatment and just take whatever I am given.<p>Instead they said, I am a human being with talent and skill (and if you earned a degree in CS, you have a lot of talent and skill compared to vast sections of the working population). They said because I am a human being, I deserve to be treated with some types of basic respect and dignity and not sold bullshit excuses for anti-human conditions.<p>And now, the battle for employee-protecting laws or social norms (at least for developers) has shifted to be about protection of workplace privacy and productivity (get rid of Agile/Scrum and get rid of open-plan offices) and the respect to be paid fair wage and compensation for your skills (don&#x27;t fall prey to start-up bullshit which argues that you ought to view certain sets of experiences or chances as valuable and be willing to trade compensation to get them).<p>You don&#x27;t need <i>any</i> job. You need a job that meets your goals. When you&#x27;re young you might fool yourself into thinking that sitting in an open floor plan or agreeing to be bound by Agile aren&#x27;t a big part of your goals. Then you realize that managers, executives, investors, and so forth, who put you in the open-plan office and tether you to Agile/Scrum fundamentally see you as commodity labor, perfectly easy to replace, and have stopped caring whatsoever about your career progress from almost the first moment they hired you.<p>It would require a massive, short-term discount factor on your own personal value to make that worthwhile -- such an incredibly self-deprecating amount of discount that it realistically could only be due to a literal emergency situation -- like you need a paycheck today or you will literally die.<p>And I&#x27;d argue that if you have minimum salary requirements, or some fuzzy idea of regular working hours or minimum vacation requirements, then you&#x27;re not at all in a situation where you need wage as a literal emergency necessitating you to deeply undervalue yourself. And even if you did, you could simply compromise on the field of labor, and do something besides CS jobs if you <i>had</i> to.<p>At any rate, I do not agree that simply being young and needing a first job is any excuse at all for being willing to tolerate open-plan offices, Agile/Scrum, or the false promises of start-ups. Just say no to all that shit and you&#x27;ll ensure the first job you get <i>actually helps you</i> in terms of having an actually prosperous software career.",1453091554

[1]<p>But his first assertion (that inequality is not bad) could still be wrong.<p>I think his essay is built on the assumption that people care more about absolute values of wealth and not relative ones. Psychology indicates that relative measures of wealth more directly map to levels of happiness and unhappiness. People <i>do</i> care about relative levels of income as opposed to absolute levels of income, and social cohesion is affected directly by such resentment, <i>even if there isn&#x27;t extreme poverty and incomes are rising across the board!</i><p>In Singapore, where I live, there is relatively strong meritocracy and little extreme poverty. GDP per capita is high, and rising; the government is directly incentivised to create economic growth (their bonuses are pegged to national GDP increases). But ostentatious displays of wealth - made easier, IMO, by social media - have led to rising resentment of the government&#x27;s policies, as well as resentment against the globalised rich who chose to make Singapore their home.<p>I also think economic literature and history is rich with the negative social effects of economic inequality (even if some of it is conflated with bad causes, as pg describes). Elsewhere in this thread tkiley talks about how economic inequality can be seen as a negative externality, which is a good way of describing it, and is, I think, the attitude economists seem to take.<p>While pg&#x27;s essay contains a fascinating call: to imagine a world where we have to chose to live with increasing economic inequality, I do not believe such a world would be easy to live in.<p>[1] To paraphrase his argument, progressive taxation might bring down the Gini coefficient but not necessarily do anything to alleviate poverty if the systemic causes of poverty aren&#x27;t attacked. Better to &#x27;attack poverty and destroy wealth in the process, as opposed to attacking wealth and hoping it destroys poverty as a side effect&#x27;.",1453091203

There&#x27;s a bit of a misunderstanding here, and I wouldn&#x27;t nitpick on it if I didn&#x27;t think it betrayed something about the author&#x27;s point. In some way or other he sees Docker as additional overhead, like a VM. While there obviously is _some_ overhead this isn&#x27;t an accurate picture. As for the overall point of doing everything in a container, according to various sources that is exactly what Google does now, for example. The reason is that containers capture dependencies, and they make for much more fluid and manageable systems. As with most changes of this magnitude there are waves of adulation and revulsion, but overall I think this is the new world.<p>On the elasticsearch point: you can use environment variables inside the elasticsearch.yml file, and you can set environment variables inside a container when you execute it so there is a complete pathway to pipe configuration information into the container. There are really only two things that cause an issue: discovery and disk volumes. Discovery is a problem because es uses udp multicast by default, but there are plugins that substitute other mechanisms for listing cluster members. On kubernetes/GKE we use a fabric8 plugin for this. Disk volumes are an issue just because most container platforms don&#x27;t yet deal well with them. We had to roll our own solution for dynamically attaching replication controllers to GCE persistent disks, but there are some better solutions in the release pipe.",1453090795

What matters is what&#x27;s causing it, and what problems it causes.  If a big multiplier is caused by an atmosphere that promotes innovation, that&#x27;s better than a small multiplier caused by a stagnant environment, which is better than a big multiplier caused by massive corruption and oppression.  Norway, Sweden, and Finland have some of the lowest Gini coefficients in the world, way &quot;better&quot; than the US or the UK -- but so do Pakistan and Afghanistan.  &quot;Where to put the multiplier&quot; is, at best, a secondary question after fixing all of the primary problems, and possibly a completely irrelevant question.",1453089930

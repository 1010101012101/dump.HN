Some fraction of that is effectively uncollectable (it doesn&#x27;t pool into anything dammable in the first place). Another fraction of that is ecologically necessary, to prevent, say, salinification of the bay (see the Aral Sea for a very good example of what happens when you ignore that).<p>Based on the current rude ecological health of the Bay Area, damming any inflow to that would not improve the water budget overall. You might improve capacity, but you wouldn&#x27;t improve throughput, and it&#x27;s the throughput budget that&#x27;s in the negative right now.<p>There&#x27;s another factor, too: municipal water supplies are basically reusable. When you take a wasteful shower, most of that water is going down the drain and into the sewer, where it can easily be discharged ahead of the municipal intake. Getting 90% of the water back is not unimaginable. It&#x27;s lawn-care (~50% of municipal water usage) and agriculture where the water is nowhere near as recoverable.<p>To put numbers on that: the 5.2 million acre-ft that municipal water systems use (excluding lawn-care, itself 4.8 million) comes out to more like .52 million in practice... compared to 34 million acre-ft for agricultural usage. You could double the residential population of California, and, assuming you don&#x27;t add new lawns, with an increase of water usage of just 1%.",1440311545

Most of the jump instructions I see in my disassembly aren&#x27;t unconditional like goto is - if anything, car engines are closer to horses in what they accomplish than, say, jnz is to goto!  Even jmp certainly doesn&#x27;t used named labels, as any goto worth it&#x27;s salt will use - instead you&#x27;ll see absolute or relative address offsets.<p>>> Personally, I do not mind gotos. It feels closer to the reality of how a computer operates.<p>There&#x27;s a time and place to get close to the hardware, but I&#x27;ve never felt that goto got me meaningfully closer.  Of course, my first and primary exposure to GOTO was in BASIC - where it was <i>interpreted</i>.<p>You want to get close to the hardware?  Play with intrinsics.  Open up the disassembly and poke at it with a profiler.  Find out if your algorithm manages to execute in mostly L1 cache, or if it&#x27;s spilling all the way out into RAM fetches.  Figure out where you need to prefetch, where you&#x27;re stalling, where your cycles are being spent.  Diagnose and fix some false sharing.  Write your own (dis)assembler - did you know there&#x27;s typically no actual nop instruction?  You simply emit e.g. xchg eax, eax, which happens to do nothing of note, and label it &quot;nop&quot; for clarity.<p>IMO, you&#x27;ll have more time to do these things when embracing the advantages that structured programming can provide.

Jackson Pollack has been decried as an alcoholic fraud by some, but like Da Vinci, it is the techniques he pioneered as much as his works that are fascinating.

Otherwise humanity would have died out long ago. Quoting from <a href=""http://bwca.cc/tripplanning/waterfiltration.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bwca.cc/tripplanning/waterfiltration.htm</a> :<p>> Thirty years ago, we didn&#x27;t fret about lake-water microbes. We just drank the water straight or spiked it with iodine. Today, that is changed. Many of us grip our water filters and cautiously take a sip. In fact, Giardia and other water-borne pathogens often star in those scary mind-flicks we conjure from bears, bugs, and huge, wind-swept waves.<p>> Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;m not saying that six months of recurring diarrhea isn&#x27;t something to ponder. Just don&#x27;t panic if you swallow a mouthful of lake water. The Boundary Waters isn&#x27;t a New York sewer. Much of the water is clean. The problem is, we can&#x27;t distinguish the clean sources from the dirty ones.<p>> That&#x27;s why I filter, boil, or chemically disinfect the water I use for drinking, washing dishes, and brushing my teeth. On the other hand, canoe-country author Michael Furtman has roamed the Boundary Waters for nearly 40 years, and hasn&#x27;t treated a drop and has never been sick. He&#x27;s not alone. Quite a few Boundary Waters old-timers and wilderness guides drink the water. But they are careful about where they collect it.<p>In any case, my water filter for camping is only a ceramic filter. It doesn&#x27;t change the oxygen or CO2 levels. If TillE&#x27;s proposal is correct, the output after filtering should still be &#x27;stale&#x27;.<p>What you said about well water is true, but my examples were structured to avoid ground contamination. If you collect rainwater, and let it sit for a day, does it taste &#x27;stale&#x27;?",1440309727

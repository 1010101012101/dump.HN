We would log into the computer via terminals and build and test that way. This was in the late 80s.<p>I remember that it was a pretty straightforward architecture, though. Something like 68000, which I knew already, but it was even more orthogonal with respect to addressing modes. I think it had 16 32-bit registers, and you could use any as an address to load data from, complete with offset for easy manipulation of data structures.<p>I do know x86, and while the 8086 was designed by idiots, it's not that hard to get the basics. Segment registers are a PITA, but as long as you're using 32-bit mode and not accessing more than 4Gb at a time, you can mostly ignore them. I've had to deal with something similar in another architecture, and you just end up with abstractions that hide the details as much as possible. Same as coding anything else that's nontrivial, really.",1316804368

3031124,comment,3030515,3030801,16,0,bradleyland,,,"These conversations are inherently difficult to articulate. ""Creepy"" is an adjective one uses to describe how something makes <i>them</i> feel. There's probably a more specific term for words like this. That is, the adjective isn't an entirely objective measure.<p>Think about this conversation for a moment::<p>Dick: I sure do hate strawberries. They're gross!<p>Jane: OMG, you are so crazy. Strawberries are delicious!<p>Dick & Jane: LOL (literally, they have a laugh)<p>In this conversation, neither Dick nor Jane are upset or confused by the other's feelings about strawberries. There is little ambiguity to the fact that the adjective ""gross"" applies only to Dick's feelings about strawberries. Neither feels threatened by the other's feelings about strawberries, because neither of them have any significant emotional investment in the fruit, and their relationship won't suffer as a result.<p>Step back and look at the Facebook Timeline situation. The author finds it creepy. ""It"", is the act of inviting others in to your life experiences on such an intimate level. ""Creepy"" is how the author feels when considering doing so on his own Facebook account.<p>Some people, when they read the conversation about strawberries above will have a visceral reaction about Dick's dislike of strawberries. ""How can anyone dislike strawberries,"" they'll exclaim!? The same thing is happening here with the Facebook Timeline conversation. For some people, the Facbook Timeline is like inviting a complete stranger in to the bathroom with you, and not a bathroom with stalls and dividers. I'm talking one toilet here. Then again, maybe you're in to that kind of thing. I'm not here to judge.<p>The point is that in any sizable population, you're going to have divergent viewpoints on what is ""creepy"" and what is not. Creepy is not an objective measurement. It's how you feel about something. What I don't understand is the author's framing of the issue:<p><i>""Nobodys forced to use Facebook, of course, although for many its pretty much a mandatory part of the social experience. What worries me is the trend of radical transparency and social context throughout the web software industry, where its expected that everyone will share their lives unless theyve got something to hide. On the surface, for white males like me living in California, theres a lot to be said for this on an individual level; dont lie, be up-front, wear your intentions and motivations on your sleeve. But ultimately the decision about what to share has to be the individuals  if you dont feel like sharing something, dont. Radically transparent interfaces are designed in a way that leads to a kind of peer pressure for disclosure: everyone else is sharing information about A, B and C, so why are you being so evasive?""</i><p>To paraphrase, ""I recognize that I'm not forced to use Facebook, but I'm worried about the impending pressure to share."" Taken further, one could say that the author is concerned about the ""implications"" of this. Implications is code for something else though. It's a rhetorical device used to represent a growing dissonance between the author's feelings on a subject and the perceived consensus.",1316804096

3031122,comment,3029887,3030653,5,0,redrobot5050,,,">Eventually the US government will sell back the banks and make some income, so its hardly comparable. Sweden in the early nineties did this and they recovered more than half their money.<p>Compared to what America got out of the space race, the bailout was a complete waste. America got something like 100X their ROI in going into space. Major investments in materials science, aerospace engineering, battery technology, computer technology, their probably isn't a product today on the market that isn't using some kind of ""space age technology"" that ultimately came about because of NASA's space race.<p>So the space race was clearly worth it. The bank bailout is still clearly debatable. I would argue that because the banks turned around and paid out bonuses, that we should have placed the banks into receivership and re-structured them. In our post-bailout system, the banks have grown even more concentrated and reform is pretty much a failure. We're set up to be ""way too big to fail"" next time around.<p>When that happens, we won't be talking about ""getting half our money back"" and saying it was a ""good deal"".",1316804050

3031116,comment,3029887,3030929,14,0,mkn,,,"""Contrary to popular belief, the people in government who make laws and control regulation are not bumbling idiots.""<p>Actually, in the case of the export restriction laws in question, they were bumbling idiots. These laws were passed in haste after there was an accidental disclosure of technology from the U.S. to the Chinese during an investigation of a launch failure. The law is terribly vague, with industry leaders unable to tell even what is covered by it or isn't. Additionally, enforcement responsibility moved from the Commerce Department to the Defense Department, with a concomitant increase in red tape that really only a large prime defense contractor could have the resources to cope with.<p>It would not be too much of a stretch to say that this law would be like outlawing airline travel completely on the basis of security concerns arising out of 9/11.<p>Finally, the arguments that will bring about a much needed change to these regulations will not be economic in nature, they will be arguments about national security. Already there is an international market for technologies untainted by U.S. control. Unfortunately for the U.S., the need for that market is going away as U.S. companies have been isolated for so long, and other nations have been so free to cooperate for so long, that non-U.S. space technology is, for the most part, superior to U.S. technology on cost, reliability, and performance bases. We, the U.S., are losing the larger security war by winning every local security battle with senseless and callous efficiency.",1316803944

The last Hubble repair mission went way beyond the Hubble's expected service capabilities, which was an amazing accomplishment.<p>However, it's <i>vastly</i> more economically sound and safer to bring an aging device down in controlled descent and send up a brand new one with all the latest bells and whistles than it is to send up the Shuttle with a crew and do space walks for a repair and upgrade mission.<p>The shuttle weights 4.5 million pounds not including cargo. The Hubble telescope weighs 24,500 pounds. Most of the cost is getting things into orbit, and when building devices the cost of a second spare is insignificant compared to the cost of the first one. Obviously sending a 4.5 million pound shuttle as payload with crew into orbit costs considerably more and also destroys more of the ozone layer than sending a 24,500 lb payload.",1316803298

Since content is developed for the exams somewhat independently, we have to be able to roll out releases at different speeds per exam, so we needed a solution a bit more complex than just feature flags -- here's the solution I built:<p>We keep a table of feature releases, each with a reference to the exam, a slug to identify the feature and an number from 0 to 100 indicating their status in the release cycle (100 = disabled, 75 = alpha, 50 = private beta, 25 = public beta, 0 = full release, etc.). Then each user is also assigned an integer which indicates the point in the release cycle at which they get to see features (0 by default). When we want to give them access to a feature, we just adjust their release access accordingly. All this is controlled through the admin interface.<p>We then use a helper (in views and server-side), feature_active_for?(feature_slug, user) which returns true the exam has the feature enabled and if the release status is less than or equal to the user's release access, so we can do stuff like:<p>if feature_active_for?(:lesson_videos, current_user)<p># use video template<p>else<p># use plain text template<p>end<p>This has worked really well so far, giving the non-technical content producers and customer support the ability to manage releases as they test content. However, the biggest advantage is that we can now give customers access to features before their public release to build goodwill after support requests and gather feedback. (we've been giving out a fraction of the refunds that we did before the release control)<p>I haven't actually removed any of the feature flags yet (we can reuse the release process for each other exam that we develop content for) but I'll probably remove one when it if becomes an integral part of the product across all of our exams. It would actually be pretty easy to just add to the helper to intercept release status checks and ease up on database requests.<p>This is probably all a bit more complicated than what you'll need, but I hope it helps.",1316803040

3030996,comment,3029872,3030477,29,0,dxbydt,,,"> without lying, cheating, or backstabbing...not have to mislead people, or break your promises.<p>From my time in the valley, I'd say dishonesty, misleading clients, breaking promises, not delivering on time, all of that is very much a part of the sv culture.<p>At Sun, we'd tell all our clients that Microsoft was evil, out to crush us. Our CEO Scott McNealy sent around a famous email about the sizes of MS & non-MS file formats. ""Sun will win"" had 12 chars * 1byte/char = 12 bytes as a textfile, 24 bytes as an Openoffice file, and 100,000 bytes as an MS powerpoint slide! While entirely factual, it was quite a dubious example, considering that internally within Sun, we happily used Wintel machines, used powerpoint for presentations, emailed Word files around instead of PDFs, and dissed openoffice as a piece of junk :)<p>When Java was in its infancy ( 1997-2000 period ), a lot of promises were made & fell by the wayside. Sun was building up its consulting arm, so we'd go out to customer sites and say Yes Java can do this, that and the other. Then we'd come back & Javasoft would tell us, look this feature is simply not part of the forthcoming API. Sometimes they'd get an old wise Unix/C hacker to write C code to do whatever was necessary beneath the covers, and then write a JNI wrapper atop that and thus claim Hey Java can actually do telnet & ftp natively ( Ha!).<p>I had to deal with a lot of graphics code that was routinely promised & arrived DOA. One of the primary requirements for most financial sevices firms was a table widget to display spreadsheets. AWT didn't have one. Someday there was suposed to be something called Swing, and it would have a powerful table API that would rival the MFC widgets in its power. That's what Sun told us, and that's what we as Sun consultants sold to all our Wall Street clients. But the damn thing took so long to build, every firm had their own proprietary table APIs.<p>At GS I worked on something called GSTable ( God those horrible memories make them go away! ) So this godawful GSTable was a homecooked solution to display tabular data. I started with something stupid - create an array of Label ( AWT labels ) and put them in a Panel. This created m x n + 1 components per table - too heavy & memory intensive. Then when Swing came out & didn't have a table, we made m x n JLabel's and put them into a JPanel. Over the summer, a Princeton computer graphics intern coded up a canvas ( just 1 custom Component ) that overrode paint() and drew all the cell contents. That worked so well, GS made the teen a six figure offer while he was still in his junior year. All he'd have to do is maintain that table widget! He wisely turned them down & went on to become a computer graphics heavyweight. Meanwhile, I worked on that GSTable as it went through various iterations, until it was actually capable of displaying rows and columns with different sizes, which was apparently a very common requirement in finance. Then finally the Swing JTable arrived! I was like Hallejulah end of all my misery! But alas, Sun's promises & its deliverable were so far apart. That JTable couldn't display multiwidth rows, the paint code was riddled with scaling bugs, it was a bloody mess. There were actual fuck this and fuck that blocks of code in the repaint...the frustrated Javasoft developer wrestling with repaint math! So we stuck with the GSTable. Then IBM came out with their SWT, you had Marimba with their desktop widgets...but everytime we decided to adopt something as the standard, that company would just vanish into thin air...Marimba decided it wanted to get out of AWT widgets business and stick to push technology so that was that...so many broken promises and toy widgets, certainly none of them worth the hundreds of thousands of dollars in license fees.<p>Everybody likes to paint wall st as a paragon of evil while the poor honest tech genius slogs away in the valley working on the cutting edge of technology. In reality, greed is rampant on both sides, money flows from main st to wall st & from there on to the valley. Everybody's got his fingers in the cookie jar.",1316801895

He played his cards right, came out hundreds of millions of dollars ahead, and then he <i>got out</i>.  He's not in this to control your social life or anything, he just played the Silicon Valley game and got his.<p>The issue is really about the people who <i>are</i> trying to control your social life, and who are trying to convince the sort of people who read Hacker News to use them as a stable, reliable piece of infrastructure for your projects and businesses.

Now, if you have the money to spend, perhaps for a gift, and you don't feel confident that you can find a good typewriter and assemble it yourself, $700 might be worth it to you.",1316801384

3030942,comment,3029922,3029922,4,0,mootothemax,,,"There are a few interesting explanations in a Guardian article[1] published today:<p><i>Heinrich Paes at Dortmund University and colleagues believe it might be possible for neutrinos to move through hidden, extra dimensions of space and effectively take shortcuts through space-time. ""The extra dimension is warped in a way that particles moving through it can travel faster than particles that go through the known three dimensions of space. It's like a shortcut through this extra dimension. So it looks like particles are going faster than light, but actually they don't.""</i><p><i>Another potential explanation for the observation was given by Alan Kostelecky at Indiana University, who has devoted his career to violations of the limiting speed of light. He proposed in 1985 that an energy field that lies unseen in the vacuum might explain the finding. The field allows neutrinos to move faster through space than photons, the particles that make up light.<p>""It may very well be that neutrinos travel faster than light does in that medium. It is not at all unreasonable that that would be the case.""</i><p>[1]<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/sep/23/physicists-speed-light-violated"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/sep/23/physicists-spe...</a>",1316801158

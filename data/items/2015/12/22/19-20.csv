This was added to someones sentence ex post facto, and that is not cool. It is fairly cut and dry; You only are sentenced according to the law at the time you committed the crime. Adding new punishments, no matter how well intentioned, is unconstitutional. I don&#x27;t even have to cite an amendment, it&#x27;s in article 1.",1450814372

I would also maintain that the 100km altitude flight is important - it&#x27;s the internationally recognised boundary of space - and that the &#x27;first&#x27; that Blue Shepherd claimed was valid, since the SpaceX Grasshopper did not cross the 100km Karman line.<p>The important parts are that the flight is of a 1.) reusable, 2.)

We sell, implement and customize enterprise software for large organizations, including public universities.<p>We NEVER provide pricing upfront. This is despite the fact that our software vendors have their prices listed clearly on their pricesheets. We know the price of a user license. But the first time our clients see the price is after we&#x27;ve performed our due diligence, learned the ins and outs of their business, and are sitting in front of their C-level people presenting the final proposal along with the Scope of Work document that outlines implementation details.<p>The reason we don&#x27;t provide prices upfront is because it commoditizes the software and therefore our skills and services. It encourages clients to do an extremely shallow feature-by-feature comparison of the competing products. Doing that makes sense when purchasing commodities such as toothpaste or laundry detergent. You can look at two products at the shelf, compare their features, and go with the one that you think is better based on the messaging on the package (&quot;25% more whitening power!&quot;). But enterprise software is not like that. It is very complex and the price of the software is often only a small part of the final price, which is frankly unknown at the start of the engagement. That&#x27;s why me giving you pricing information wouldn&#x27;t help you one bit (in fact it could make you look bad to your superiors when the final price is several times higher than what you gave them originally).<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: most of our clients LIKE the fact that we don&#x27;t discuss price upfront. They understand that software is a different beast, and its value is dependent upon how well it fits into and/or can be molded into the needs of the business. Only very inexperienced purchasers push us for price, and over the years we&#x27;ve found ways of disarming or at least sidestepping them.<p>The bottom line is that companies who provide price upfront end up competing on price. And history has shown us that that&#x27;s a race to the bottom.",1450813015

Actually, since the national debt keeps going up, and we&#x27;ve engaged in multiple wars since then, a case could be made that we&#x27;re worse off.<p>I could argue against all of these points, but it seems like that would be pointless.<p>> So, maybe what you meant to say was,<p>I would rather lose absolutely everything (including things that have helped me out in the last 20 years like family assistance. the idea is that I have to go by my wits as much as possible) and stay in today&#x27;s USA than step into a time machine with any amount of money to mid 1980s USA. I believe that, just by relying on national wealth, I could become as rich as I wanted to in relatively short order in a way that would have been impossible 30 years ago. You don&#x27;t think the world&#x27;s changed all that much but I do. We seem to lack the shared vocabulary needed for me to convey why I think that way.<p>> ...as long as it&#x27;s in the United States. (Which you did not clarify in the first place.)<p>I did, in another part of the thread. I thought you would have been thoughtful enough to follow the rest of the discussion to get the missing pieces of my argument. A lot of times I&#x27;ll, not just look at the whole thread, but also click to see some of the author&#x27;s other conversations to see where he / she&#x27;s coming from.<p>> So, as a rich person 20 years ago, you&#x27;d move to the nation with the greatest national wealth.<p>Maybe. Depends on how much I have tying myself down there. The aforementioned author&#x27;s great great grandmother had brothers that died in the Holocaust rather than emigrate from Latvia because they had a thriving local business there. Elon Musk brought himself and his family over from South Africa, that&#x27;s how much he believed in national wealth. I&#x27;m not sure I would come to the same conclusions so quickly, and Musk did have a really ugly childhood that he was anxious to escape. I perhaps might have found a local maximum rather than a bigger pond. Or perhaps not. I don&#x27;t have the experience of growing up in an emerging market to draw on to be able to make a real guess. I can only judge based on my current awareness.<p>> I think my friends and family still unconditionally love me. Are you convinced they don&#x27;t?<p>It&#x27;s one of those things you don&#x27;t know until you know. Or you know until you don&#x27;t. Do I think it&#x27;s possible you&#x27;re miscalculating these feelings? Certainly. I do know that you haven&#x27;t carefully considered the full breadth of things that could affect your relationships. What if part of your brain shut down and you became a different person than you were before? Read an article where that precise thing happened recently. What is it precisely that your family loves about you and what would happen if that thing were to be taken away? If you delve into that question, I think you&#x27;d find that each member of your family has different values and would react differently to each kind of stress. You&#x27;d also have to figure out what unconditional love is and how to define the event of that love going away.<p>Things get a lot more difficult when you apply real logic to mushy situations.<p>> the US twenty years ago isn&#x27;t THAT different from the US today<p>I very much disagree.<p>> All the data says you&#x27;re EXTREMELY likely to have the same wealth as your parents.<p>Data does not predict anything. It only describes what has happened. In a certain light. If you examined the data yourself and asked your own questions of it you might come to a different conclusion.<p>> Most of the people stocking soup kitchens are more like me.<p>How do you know this? Have you gone and looked? Have you asked a significant number of them their stories and how they came to volunteer? I&#x27;ll admit my assertion in this regard is probably about as valid as this one. But that&#x27;s how you find out.<p>> Even our beloved veterans are homeless, unemployed, and suicidal.<p>What that means is that the mental problems caused by going to war are worse than we have the ability to effectively help, at this moment in time. But there&#x27;s plenty of research going into things like PTSD so that we can more effectively help these people. Suicide is an extremely difficult problem to solve.<p>> WHY BOTHER talking, if you don&#x27;t ENJOY talking with people who think differently than you? SERIOUSLY?<p>I do enjoy it.

We were told the problems with DOM updates was caused by the old layouts and things like floats.<p>Nobody said that.<p>> So Flexbox was supposed to fix those problems.<p>No, it wasn&#x27;t.<p>> I find myself frustrated that now 8 years after the iPhone the web is still incapable of so many things.<p>Me too.<p>> Here&#x27;s a very simple goal: A swipeable sidebar.<p>You can do it already at 60 FPS. Make an overflow:scroll div and allow the user to scroll it into view. Or even just do it manually with the DOM. It will easily be 60 FPS in existing engines <i>if you animate transforms</i>.<p>> That&#x27;s it. Make that happen. Do whatever it takes. Create another new layout if necessary. Create a new touch spec that&#x27;s faster, if necessary. Whatever. it. takes. And then when the work is done you can point to this new widget and say that the initiative paid off.<p>There&#x27;s nothing to do here, as you&#x27;ve described it.<p>But your comment is actually illustrative of the real problem (at least, what I think it is). We have a ton of ways to do things on the Web. Some of them are fast, and some of them are not. Web developers don&#x27;t realize what the fast paths are (which is not entirely their fault). I think that all of the paths should be fast, and I think that many of Servo&#x27;s technologies (such as WebRender) go a long way toward making that happen.<p>What&#x27;s frustrating is comments like yours that describe things that the Web can clearly already do and blame browsers for supposedly being unable to do simple things. I used to think the way you did—that the Web is incapable of rendering a 60 FPS scrollable view—and then quickly discovered that, if optimized properly, there is actually no problem. What I think the problem with Web slowness is that Web authors don&#x27;t know what the fast paths are, and they use things like jQuery.animate() that hit all the slow paths. That is a problem that I think we are well equipped to solve in Servo due to things like parallel style recalculation, off main thread layout, and WebRender, but it&#x27;s a lot more nuanced than what you describe.",1450811476

Most Uber drivers would prefer to drive for Lyft because Lyft pays more (partially why they&#x27;re losing more money than Uber), but in most markets Lyft doesn&#x27;t have as many riders that use the service. As a driver, you want to maximize time spent with a fare vs. fare-hunting. Similarly, as a rider, you are weighing price vs. time meaning most people will pay more $ to wait less for their ride.<p>Most drivers I talk to drive for both and keep both on, but get more pings on Uber than on Lyft.

Glad to hear the trig article helped (one of my favorite aha moments -- all the trig functions, including stuff like the exotic cosecant, can be drawn together.)<p>I&#x27;m a fan of Tau as an interesting simplifying concept but don&#x27;t think mentions of pi should necessary be removed. My intuition is that radians are &quot;distance traveled&quot; as you go along a circle. Pi is the &quot;neutral to max to neutral&quot; distance and Tau is the full cycle (neutral, max, neutral, min, neutral). Ideally we just think about &quot;distance&quot; and context determines whether we want the journey to be &quot;there and back&quot; or just &quot;there&quot;.",1450810989

Send them a free month offer if they give you the email of 5-10 of their friends likely to need your service.  Or some variation of that idea.  You should absolutely be sending them emails and talking to them regularly as well.  Let&#x27;s say you have 100 active users right now, I&#x27;d be calling the top 25 and talking to the people directly and getting their feedback.  It doesn&#x27;t mean you will implement exactly what they ask for, but the fact you picked up the phone and called them to talk and get their input will go a long way towards building loyalty.<p>If the people signed up are the right audience, e.g. they are engaged and using the product, then get some demographics on those people.  If you didn&#x27;t collect it up front, do a survey, or utilize a marketing company to get you data on those contacts (like Acxiom or other many other providers).  This will give you a profile of the type of people, or companies if it is a B2B app.  Then take that data and do some Facebook or Display ads that are targeted at a similar audience.<p>Also, if you have a free trial of say 14 days, offer to extend it to 30 days if at the time of signup the user gives you 5 emails (names) of people as a referral.  Then you can solicit them.<p>If you are starting from scratch with an already built site, then you need to reverse engineer the demographics of who will be your early adopters and go find where they hang out, where they do their research and what is important to them to make a decision etc.  Then you setup offers where those people are researching (or playing etc), and you get active in those communities.  Also, good time to write some posts on medium and publicize them and start writing some of your own blog posts that you can point people to as well (again promote them places).  In the end, this is a numbers game and it is about getting out there and exposing yourself and your product to as specific of a group as you can to find the right fit.  Then you keep expanding the types of groups you target.<p>Hopefully that helps a little more.  One other comment, Marketing is about doing a series of experiments where failure is guaranteed on a pretty regular basis if you are trying enough.  Marketing is never about getting it right once and never looking back, clients are always changing, and you have to chase and find where they are and find a way to get people to reach into their wallet and fork over money to you.  Failure in marketing is different then failure in say engineering some life critical piece of equipment, in both cases you will learn from failure, but obviously no one dies if you jack up a few marketing campaigns so the relative cost of learning is low.",1450810970

With technical trading all you need is your computer and you. Why would a young person who is skilled at technical trading work inside an investment bank? How can you be sure that there aren't thousands of skilled traders making a killing from home?  Isn't this sort of like hackers?

Take a look at the currency desk, and you'll realize the average age is around 50. Why?<p>Bonds, stocks, exotics -- that stuff is all teachable. Give someone two years and they can learn to work the markets. Currency has basically zero theory surrounding it. The guys who are really good have no idea why they're good at it. It's basically all just trapped in their heads and they can't get it out. That's why the guys who are good at it tend to stick around forever and they end up being much older than the other guys on average.",1189998329
55507,comment,54465,55065,0,0,Shooter,,,"Yes, I have a problem with the source.  I thought that might be your source based on your phrasing and the fact that there are so few that criticize Campbell's research.<p>I won't go out of my way to criticize the Weston A. Price Foundation, though.  People can make up their own minds. I just find it funny that you question Campbell's motives, but not the motives of his critics.    <p>Campbell has spent 50+ years as a scientist, largely funded by research grants from the National Institute of Health, and has arrived at the conclusion that diets low in animal products are healthier.  Since a responsible nutrition researcher is likely to share and promote news that he believes to be both lifesaving and actionable, it is only natural that he would ally himself with other physicians that have also come to the same conclusion (Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine) to spread that message.  PCRM is a great organization, in my opinion, and their membership is composed of some of the leading physicians in the area of nutrition, including the physicians that are the only ones to have successfully reversed advanced heart disease without medication.    <p>The Weston A. Price Foundation claims it is 'unbiased', in contrast to the PCRM.  That is bullshit.  Follow the money to smell the bias.  The Weston A. Price Foundation's membership is largely composed of family farmers, including ranchers and dairy farmers.  Do you think they might be a bit biased on the subject?  You will notice that the foundation's homepage at <a href=""http://www.westonaprice.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.westonaprice.org/</a> currently has logos from eight companies that sponsor their conferences.  What do we see?  A meat company, a seafood company, a supplement company, a publishing company, etc.  Yep, no bias there.<p>By the way, the link you give is for a review of the book ""The China Study"" by Campbell and his son, which is not the ACTUAL published China research study I was citing.  Only a chapter of that book is devoted to the China research study.
Campbell wrote a rebuttal to the review you cite, which is reproduced at:<p><a href=""http://www.vegsource.com/articles2/campbell_china_response.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vegsource.com/articles2/campbell_china_response.h...</a><p>Masterjohn then wrote a rebuttal to that rebuttal...and then Campbell wrote a response to that.  It's all very tiring, actually, because anyone can just look at the research studies in the aggregate and see who is right based on the science.",1189998308

55505,comment,54834,55428,0,0,gwenhwyfaer,,,"Er, what's arrogant or critical about correcting a misconception (that The Fountainhead was based on Lloyd Wright's life) with a reference?<p>As to Lloyd Wright's skills as an architect (if that's what ""superficial, critical statements about highly creative people"" was referring to) - I do not dispute that he was highly creative, nor that he was the first great American architect. But his roofs habitually leaked, and there were other technical problems with his creations. Since buildings, whilst unquestionably being creative endeavours, are not <i>purely</i> expressive in purpose, technical failings are not trivialities; they'd have curtailed the career of a lesser architect.<p>Oddly enough, the same is true in software; there's lots of uninspired but technically competent software, there's rather less beautiful but technically unsound software; and very little code which is both beautiful and sound - but competence can keep a coder in the game even if they have no artistic flair.",1189998129

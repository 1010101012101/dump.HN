Nothing gets my attention more than non-technical people that learned how to code, and even if it's not the world's most brilliant code, it demonstrates umph and a willingness to do what they can for their business and for understanding.<p>Having learned how to code will also give you perspective, even if you're not going to be doing it later in the company. When you've broken your back coding, you'll realize that no feature is ever 'trivial', among other things.<p>It'll make you get along and understand your technical team a lot better.",1300654732

2347383,comment,2346590,2347134,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"1) I think the right question to ask here is, how often is the lack of compile-time checking a problem in practice, and how big a problem is it?  I've worked extensively in both static and dynamic languages, and my experience has been that in dynamic languages, while I do miss static type checking occasionally, it happens quite a bit less often than your parachute analogy would lead one to imagine.<p>Look at it this way.  Programs have lots of important properties.  Some of these we have figured out how to encode as types so that we can verify them statically.  But (although research in this area is ongoing) there are still a lot of important properties we require of our programs that can't be statically verified.  The upshot is, we have to test them.  Yes, testing is necessarily imperfect, but we have to do it anyway.  In my experience, in the course of testing a program in a dynamic language, the kinds of errors that would have been caught by static typing are relatively easy to find by testing; usually, the errors that are hard to find by testing are also well beyond the scope of static typing.  Maybe that will change eventually, though I'm skeptical, but it's certainly the state of type systems in common use at the moment.<p>So the parachute analogy is grossly exaggerated; it's more like leaving your shoelaces untied.<p>When Doel says ""you're depriving yourself of the ability to state and enforce the invariant..."", it's not clear whether he means ""always"" or ""at least sometimes"".  I concede that he could have meant the latter, in which case you're right, my counterargument fails.  But as I've just argued, there are lots of other invariants that we can't statically enforce anyway, and they tend to be the more important ones.<p>2) A table is a bag (multiset) of tuples of some specific type (schema).  When you add a column, the table now has a different type, because it's now a bag of tuples of a different type.<p>Imagine that instead of using a database you keep all your data in a running process of a program written in a static language.  (Let's ignore the possibility that the program or the machine might crash.)  How are you going to structure the data?  To make use of static typing, you need to use collections of records (or ""structs"" or whatever you like to call them).  How then would you add a field to one of these record types?  There's no way to do it without recompiling your program, and there's no way to do that without either losing your data or dumping them to files and reading them back in to the new version of the program.<p>Now, you <i>could</i> store your data differently, by explicitly modelling rows as maps from keys to values.  But what's the range type of your map?  Why, it's the union of the types of the possible data values you might want to store; you've lost static typing for the data values, and will have to check at runtime whether each value you read out of one of these row maps is of the correct type.",1300654666

Sometimes that means melting it down all the way down to scrap metal and then recasting it as other machinery.

Or that desktop workstation that's now too slow for a dot-com knowledge worker might be useful fodder for a Stanford grad student's research project in data mining the web.<p>Or perhaps the most striking example - gasoline was initially a ""waste"" product from the refinement of petroleum into kerosene.

What needs separating out is contracts vs hardware, and prepay vs monthly billing.<p>Smartphones have historically needed handset subsidies to be attractive to consumers, so they tend to be associated with monthly billing and have locked hardware - but locked for the duration of the contract. After the contract has run out, you are then free to ring up your contract provider and have your phone unlocked. You can then swap out the SIM, unlike what you can do with e.g. a Verizon handset. Alternatively, you can visit your local disreputable phone shop and get your phone unlocked directly (i.e. in violation of your contract).<p>The hardware itself, because of the SIMs and relative uniformity of radio bands, is switchable. This is key.<p>You're also wrong about the concept of buying minutes just coming to Europe. Business phone users under contract have long bought minutes. But most phones have been feature phones, and sold in prepay situations, which means that they are unlocked right from the get-go.<p>FWIW, when I got my first phone, it was an unused one that was rattling around in a drawer.

The problem with this is that even though you won't be initially concerned about the competition from Sprint, Verizon, AT&T, and Tmobile as you would be applying yourself to a less mainstream (aka: different) market, there are still many competitors that have 'fixed' the complaints about the big companies who have a head start over you (ie: Boost Movile, Cricket, even Virgin Mobile).  So unless you have an idea superior to these smaller upcoming companies, it will be a very difficult industry to enter in to and raise capital for.",1300652118

Women are thought to be more social, more interested in relationships and connections, better at multi-tasking.  There is also anthropological research to back this up.  Dave Morin of Path introduced me to Dunbar’s Number, proposed by the anthropologist Robin Dunbar.  The number is the theoretical limit of how many people with whom one can maintain stable relationships (thought to be 150).  But Dunbar’s most recent research shows there are different numbers for women than men—that women are able to maintain quantitatively more relationships within every ring of closeness than men.  Knowing that is an important factor if you want to build and stoke social network effects.  More female users will likely help your company grow faster.""</i>",1300651932

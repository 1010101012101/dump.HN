The middle class is being squeezed by rising costs, so your two options are to be perpetually poor (basically limiting you to a life of indentured servitude), or to out-compete your rivals and achieve an upper-middle class to upper class income, and all the perks that come with it.<p>My wife and I struggle with this constantly - income and ability to acquire resources vs. quality of life.  While I&#x27;m struggling through University while working full-time (and trying to find time for vacations, and time with the wife) and looking forward to a life of working 9-5 (more like 8-7 these days), we also think about the toll this takes on people.<p>Not going to lie, we&#x27;ve been looking at various locations where the cost of living is low (actually, more like where you can get by and start a business with a more reasonable amount of capital), and we can basically live a simpler, higher-quality life.

(I am married)<p>> How do you propose to handle Estate planning?<p>Contract law. Before you get married, sign a contract that outlines everything.<p>> Health and other insurance benefits?<p>Nothing to do with government or at least, should have nothing to do with government. The insurance companies can structure it however they want.<p>> Managing the custody of children of divorce?<p>Contract law. See above. Marriage at its heart is a business arrangement. You share resources and work for a common purpose. It&#x27;s almost like you&#x27;re starting a company with a partner.<p>Would you start a business without signing a contract that didn&#x27;t outline not only how the arrangement would function, but what would happen if it were to come to an end? Of course you wouldn&#x27;t.<p>> How exactly do you imagine the government not being involved in marriage?<p>It can be involved in marriage through contract law. The same way it&#x27;s involved in any business arrangement where a contract was signed.<p>In other words, if need be, one party can take another to court over the breach of a contract.<p>The issue today is that the government defines that contract. It specifies who the contract can be between (a man and a woman), specifies what happens when that contract ends, what benefits accrue, it essentially controls everything about that contract ... why not let the people choose what form they want their marriage to take? Why force everyone into the same universal contract that in the end doesn&#x27;t really fit anyone properly because it&#x27;s so unbelievably general?<p>> Because as it stands today, the government is inextricably a part of the concept of marriage<p>Unfortunately.<p>> the government must recognize a marriage in order for the benefits of marriage to work.<p>Resource sharing is by far the greatest benefit and it has nothing to do with the government. Yes, tax benefits and such stem directly from the government ... but that&#x27;s about it.",1428878941

He casts a net into the water and brings up a fishy assortment. Surveying his catch, he proceeds in the usual manner of a scientist to systematise what it reveals. He arrives at two generalisations: No sea-creature is less than two inches long. All sea-creatures have gills. These are both true of his catch, and he assumes tentatively that they will remain true however often he repeats it. In applying this analogy, the catch stands for the body of knowledge which constitutes physical science, and the net for the sensory and intellectual equipment which we use in obtaining it. The casting of the net corresponds to observation; for knowledge which has not been or could not be obtained by observation is not admitted into physical science. An onlooker may object that the first generalisation is wrong. &quot;There are plenty of sea-creatures under two inches long, only your net is not adapted to catch them.&quot; The icthyologist dismisses this objection contemptuously. &quot;Anything uncatchable by my net is ipso facto outside the scope of icthyological knowledge. In short, &quot;what my net can&#x27;t catch isn&#x27;t fish.&quot; Or--to translate the analogy-- &quot;If you are not simply guessing, you are claiming a knowledge of the physical universe discovered in some other way than by the methods of physical science, and admittedly unverifiable by such methods.

(Coincidentally, up until writing our own parser we were using pfff&#x27;s JavaScript parser! Go pfff!). Anyway, here are some other useful things I found in OCaml along the way:<p>Without namespacing, you might be using mutually recursive type definitions like<p><pre><code>  type statement = ExpressionStatement of expression\n  and expression = FunctionExpression of statement list\n</code></pre>\nto do this with modules you need to use recursive modules, like<p><pre><code>  module rec Statement : sig\n    type t = Expression of Expression.t\n  end = struct\n    type t = Expression of Expression.t\n  end\n\n  and Expression : sig\n    type t = Function of Statement.t list\n  end = struct\n    type t = Function of Statement.t list\n  end\n</code></pre>\nOne of the sucky things about recursive modules is that you cannot omit the signatures, however if your modules only include types then there is a shortcut that looks like<p><pre><code>  module rec Statement : sig\n    type t = Expression of Expression.t\n  end = Statement\n\n  and Expression : sig\n    type t = Function of Statement.t list\n  end = Expression\n</code></pre>\nLinks:\nBig real world example:\n<a href=""https://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/3a5b4040b7d2a648f97a06c93d9dc352c3e2b008/src/parser/spider_monkey_ast.ml#L85"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/3a5b4040b7d2a648f97a06...</a><p>Recursive module docs:\n<a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-400/manual021.html#toc75"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-400/manual021.htm...</a>",1428877947

Whether or not global warming is true is utterly irrelevant, because there is simply nothing possible that can be done about changing the overall direction of all those people that could make any measurable difference.  Now - take that &quot;truth&quot;, and apply it to local problems:\nShould I put my plastic in the recycling bin?\nShould I pay more for electricity?\nShould I suffer the annoying blueness of LED lights, instead of the nice warm glow of incandescent?\nWhy should I do what all those lunatics are telling me, and all these new &quot;green&quot; laws are forcing down my throat, when it&#x27;s all just a 100% waste of time?<p>Same goes for conservation (aka: the &quot;fun police&quot;), road rules (would it be more, or less, safe on the roads, if all rules were abolished?  And no, I don&#x27;t mean immediately, I mean after the inevitable carnage that takes place between the &quot;end of rules&quot; and the point where drivers understand about using their brains when they drive. We don&#x27;t have &quot;how not to bump into people on sidewalk&quot; rules, do we?), religious rules (many which make it into real government rules), and so on...<p>So, back to my point: &quot;totally enlightened master&quot; - that&#x27;s the bit that triggered my bullshit-alarm.<p>I&#x27;m doubting any such thing is possible, or at least, not in our modern world anymore.  Knowledge is so vast, nobody could become &quot;finally enlightened&quot; without cutting themselves of from it all. [amusingly, seems I&#x27;ve worked out form 1st-principals the idea behind monasteries?]. Even if you do master enlightenment in one part of your life, that&#x27;s going to conflict with the &quot;stupid people&quot; you inevitably have to interact with, so you then have to somehow master the manipulation and/or tolerance of them, and being, as there are, so many people out there, not all of whom you can reach or influence, and indeed, many of them running media empires or otherwise swamping the conscience of others with bogus crap, you are basically screwed.  You now have to deal with &quot;knowing&quot;, but also &quot;tolerating&quot; those who do not, who also make rules and laws for you.<p>This seems a majorly thorny meme.<p>I am though, super-interested in your &quot;some questions about very simple terms&quot;.  I wonder what you&#x27;d ask?",1428877047

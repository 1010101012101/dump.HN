A fine example is Wall Street and its army of fluffers. They are deeply opposed to government intervention, except suddenly when government intervention is in their favor that&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s not libertarianism; it&#x27;s IGMFY wearing a bow tie.<p>Also, a writing protip: basing an argument on a dictionary definition is an almost universal sign of a weak argument. It means you&#x27;ve given up trying to engage with what other people are actually saying, and are just trying to &quot;win&quot;.<p>And it&#x27;s even worse when you&#x27;re just wrong. If I type &quot;hypocrisy&quot; into Google, the first definition is &quot;the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one&#x27;s own behavior does not conform; pretense.&quot; E.g., the advocacy of (or betting on) independence from or the obsolescence of existing regulatory structures and then turning around and asking for protection from those structures.",1393700378

When stopped on a freeway or on ramp and not in the shoulder, one should never exit the vehicle.

A stalled car on a freeway on ramp is an emergency situation and by not calling 911 the author was endangering the lives of himself, his son, and anyone else using the on ramp.<p><i>edit</i> my first point was a bit off.

The fact that a lot of people like him doesn&#x27;t matter - a lot of people liked Stalin or Lenin or Hitler or Mao too.

Russia is not democratic because it is convenient for the ruling clique, not because of the US. If the US didn&#x27;t exist at all, Putin were the same dictator, maybe even worse at the loss of deterrent - though to be frank Obama administration couldn&#x27;t deter a kid from eating a booger.<p>>>> it certainly assisted the forces which performed an illegal government coup.<p>There&#x27;s no such thing as legal coup, so your insistence on it being illegal is useless - every revolution is illegal by definition, it happens when citizens lose their faith in legal.

Of course they were talking to opposition leaders and of course they said what US would like to see from them - that&#x27;s what diplomats do.<p>>>> As for me personally, being a Russian with pro-Liberty ideology,<p>Voe is for Russia if pro-Liberty Russians spend their time on proving how Putin is a nice democratic leader and US is to blame for &quot;meddling&quot; with everything and making it worse, while denying agency to anybody else completely.

And at what expense?<p>I am looking at Wikipedia:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine</a><p>Ethnic groups (2001)<p>77.8% Ukrainians<p>17.3% Russians<p>4.9% others / unspecified<p>The Russians are concentrated in the eastern-most provinces, and also in the Crimea.<p>Russia has 145 million people, the Ukraine has 46 million people, so in terms of the ratio of people, Russia invading the Ukraine would be a bit like the USA invading Mexico. Russia also has a large per-capita GDP advantage relative to the Ukraine, sort of like the USA advantage over Mexico:<p>Russia:<p>GDP (nominal)\tPer capita\t$15,717<p>Ukraine:<p>GDP (nominal) \tPer capita\t$3,862<p>I&#x27;m using the nominal GDP, not the PPP numbers, because when it comes to war it is the nominal numbers that matter (the fact that your rent might be cheap, or that you can get a haircut for cheap, influences your personal standard of living, but does not effect the outcome of a war).<p>The USA wasted over $1 trillion in Iraq. If the USA tried to conquer Mexico the war would drag on for many years and very nearly bankrupt the USA. Likewise, I suspect a full invasion of the Ukraine would bankrupt Russia. Chechnya is much smaller, yet still caused Russia considerable pain. And also, Chechnya was isolated from Western help. The Ukraine has a border with a country that is a member of the EU. It is true that the Poles dislike the fact that famous Polish cities such as Lwów were stolen and given to the Ukraine, but if it came to war with Russia, it strikes me as likely Poland allow its border to become porous, in the sense that it would be way of getting supplies to the Ukraine. It seems to me likely that the West would be largely united in wanting to help the Ukraine.<p>The substantial expense makes me think that Putin would not want to try to conquer the whole country. If that is what he wants, then he has gone insane. What seems to me more likely is that he wants to seize those provinces that are majority-Russian. This would be a grievous violation of the sovereignty of the Ukraine, and would probably be regarded as a dangerous precedent. Also, if Putin can get away with it, then there are obvious parallels to Hitler&#x27;s 1938 occupation of the Sudetenland (which was majority-German). Also remember that Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s reputation was destroyed when he argued that this one concession to Hitler would lead to peace, when in fact it lead to world war. No Western politician would want to be cast as a modern day Chamberlain, so I suspect many politicians in the West would be inclined to take a strong stand against the partial annexation of the Ukraine to Russia.<p>I&#x27;m trying to think of any major powers that would be willing to support Russia. It has some minor friends: the Serbs, the Syrian government, Cuba, maybe Hungary, etc. But what major power would be willing to support this? Does China have any reason to support Russia in this invasion? I suspect many oil-producing Middle Eastern nations would love to see an economic blockade of Russia, as that would jack up the price of oil.",1393699344

It&#x27;s a real shame we&#x27;ve ended up in a situation where the only API for manipulating the DOM is in js - script tags were not initially intended to be js only. Switching language would be the perfect opportunity to create a proper standard library for the web, by looking at the organic mess which is DOM access, js animation, etc, extracting the good parts, and throwing away all the rest. If it significantly improved dev productivity, and was available as a plugin initially for all browsers, people might be willing to experiment with it.<p>There are political and technical problems with doing that of course, but it would be a great step forward for web development, and is not at all beyond the reach of a big browser vendor.

The innovative device, developed by Dallas tech start-up 214 Technologies, can be ordered at www.getchui.com starting February 27.<p>Chui delivers real time notifications to the owner’s smart phone or computer that include the visitor’s image, name and timestamp, while also offering the option of two-way audio and one-way video.  If the visitor—such as a friend, family member or delivery person—has been “enrolled” by being photographed using either the Chui device or a web or mobile application, the notification will also identify the visitor and unlock a suite of innovative features.   Whether Chui owners are inside their home or business, in the car or travelling overseas, the notifications let them know whenever someone is at their front door.<p>Chui also offers Identity Based Audio that plays personalized messages upon recognition. For example, the owner can record a message telling a friend where a key to the front door is hidden, or a message telling a delivery person where to leave an important package.<p>In addition to playing pre-recorded messages for designated visitors, Chui can spare its owner the hassle of an awkward encounter with its Do Not Disturb feature.<p>Chui can be further enhanced by pairing it with Internet-connected locks and smart lighting systems.  These pairings allow the door to be unlocked, or the inside lights to be turned on, when Chui recognizes an authorized face.",1393698755

Electronic billing aims to make the situation better.<p>DaisyBill manages the entire billing process, both generating and sending the bill electronically and managing the responses about the status of the bill, including when it was paid and how much. As a result of using DaisyBill, practices are paid more quickly and accurately than when they submit bills via paper/snail mail. We&#x27;re talking 15 days instead of 60, 90, or more, if at all.  This makes practices more likely to take on injured workers as patients, an obvious benefit for all parties.<p>You can read more about our service offering at www.daisybill.com.<p>The stack we currently run is Rails 3 on Heroku.<p>We use Git for source control and use Macs for development.

For one thing, it&#x27;s only the narrow, web-constrained definition of &quot;framework&quot; that even vaguely works that way. Second, I&#x27;d argue that, unless the code which programmers debug has been written somewhere until the late 1990s, new code gets written often enough that programming largely consists of <i>writing</i> new code instead of debugging old one. That there are programmers hopelessly churning on the umpteenth bug because someone at the end of the Internet decided to change the format of their JSON objects and the mapping of their HTTP request handlers (pretentiously calling that &quot;an API&quot;) is not a testament to how programming has evolved, it&#x27;s merely a proof that not every change counts as evolution.<p>Instead, the choice of Python over Scheme -- which has been received with mixed feelings by almost every programmer able to write a Quicksort function without googling for compiler errors -- seems to have been driven by related, but vastly different reasons, such as:<p>* There are vast amounts of interactions spread over multiple languages, machines and platforms. Independently reasoning about objects, while essential to programming, is as central to teaching as integration in already existing architectures is. Unlike the early 1980s, when pretty much every new computer meant a new editor, a new set of programs and more often than not, a couple of new languages, being able to reason about existing architectures is incredibly important. Scheme is able to provide this, but requires fairly intimate knowledge of the implementation, whereas Python pretty much gives this away for free.<p>* A considerable deal of modern CS/CompEng research is centered around studying non-fundamental applications. It&#x27;s important to have access to tools that allow people to whip up quick experiments. Whether Python does this better than Scheme is debatable, but Python does arguably score better in terms of integration and, therefore, in terms of being able to glue new fundamental discoveries to practical problems that they solve. Perl does that too, arguably better than Python, actually, but there are lines even seasoned teachers would rather not cross.<p>* Many of the so-called real problems come from more specific fields, are sloppier and can often be less rigorously stated than those for which SICP was initially written. Again, this is debatable, but Python is more universal and easier to convey. I don&#x27;t know how much truth is behind this. I tend to disagree, because personal experience has shown me that this is the argument preferred by the kind of people who think that cool 3D data visualisation programs are a good example of a real-life problem and rotation matrices are a typical example of a useless problem that doesn&#x27;t stem from real life applications.",1393697721

Ok.<p>>Presenting this as if it is some sinister technique freshly invented<p>Well, I didn&#x27;t go into details, and I&#x27;m not an expert, but Color revolutions in ex soviet countries have certain common qualities to them. The main is &quot;nonviolent action&quot; of Gene Sharp. Holding a square for weeks, and waiting for violence to discredit government wasn&#x27;t a normal normal way to make a revolution before this method was used. Other than that there is financing of pro-Democracy NGOs, that work under assumption that there is a lack of democracy(no matter what), and leaders with western eduction or ex-Reagan administration staffer wives.<p>>dictatorship of Putin<p>While I hate Putin and don&#x27;t like Russia generally it&#x27;s too subjective and CNN-like to call Putin a dictator. He definitely has support of pupation, and is adequate to Russian people. And I think the level of democracy in Russia is not important to US policy. Russia is US&#x27;s major geopolitical opponent, one of the few of still independent ones. The US will support revolutions on Russian border no matter how democratic Russia is. Even more, it&#x27;s easy to argue that Russia is not democratic as say western europe or the US, precisely because The US is very capable at overthrowing governments.<p>>a very far cry from &quot;setting up the riots&quot; which you have claimed.<p>While of course US didn&#x27;t set up riots, it certainly assisted the forces which performed an illegal government coup. There is even a recording of ambasaddor Nuland on youtube. Maybe Yanukovich wasn&#x27;t popular in the Ukraine(Bush too at the end of his second term), but he was a legally elected president, and Eastern parts of the country supported him initially. Forces that took over the government lost in the last elections, and (most likely)didn&#x27;t have a chance at winning them next time.<p>As for me personally, being a Russian with pro-Liberty ideology, taking into account the fact that US is meddling with Russia&#x27;s neighbors, still I&#x27;m for these revolutions. I even can&#x27;t wait for one that will take out Putin. Russia must be weak and fragmented, because cultural code is very authoritarian, and if Russia is strong it will create problems not only for Russians but for people all over the world. But it&#x27;s not a position of a patriot. Nor it&#x27;s position of neutral observer.",1393697408

7325292,comment,7322912,7324058,0,0,smsm42,,,"If large players routinely pay top specialists low wages, they will cease to be large pretty soon, since their talent will be leaving for players paying better money and making those players large instead. Some people, of course, are impatient and want their enormous wage to be even more enormous - and now! And they want it while carrying no risk at all. That&#x27;s where politicians come in - delivering other people&#x27;s money while moving risk to somebody else is their specialty. Of course, their primary clientele is the same large players, but minor politicians are not above serving smaller audiences and endorsing extensive and complex regulations that would cost large players a tiny bit of their profits while making compliance so hard that smaller players would find it very expensive to compete. Which is all for good, so politicians can proceed with their good work. At the end, everybody wins - impatient people get a tiny bit of cash from large players, lawyers get a huge pile of cash from large players for managing the lawsuits, large players get higher barriers to entry, politicians get votes for restoring the order and everything is great because nobody ever asks where the money comes from.",1393696870

H1B okay.<p>AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.<p>We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) looking to add one or two engineers focusing on strategy and/or on infrastructure. No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs covering everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<p>Learn more at <a href=""http://amacapital.net/careers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amacapital.net/careers.html</a>, and contact us at careers@amacapital.net.",1393696850

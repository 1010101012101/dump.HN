9470925,comment,9469111,9469612,0,0,leoc,,,"> If you look at Apple&#x27;s trajectory over the last 15 years, you can see the vision was consistently outlined from the very beginning—the Digital Hub strategy (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9046oXrm7f8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9046oXrm7f8</a>).<p>That&#x27;s not really the case though. As Jobs outlined it in that video, the Digital Hub strategy was to sell Macintoshes by positioning them as something you could dock your consumer-electronics gadgets, mostly from third parties, into. It was a plan to sell hubs, not spokes. This strategy had limited viability for Apple, because a typical consumer wasn&#x27;t likely to think &quot;I&#x27;ve just bought this $500 camcorder, so now I need to spend twice that or more on a Mac in order to offload and edit the video&quot;. If they were going to use any computer as the digital hub for their camcorder, it was probably going to be their Windows PC. That&#x27;s probably why iTunes for Windows was such a difficult and long-drawn-out decision for Jobs: because it was a decision to mostly abandon the Digital Hub approach in favour of selling more of the spokes. Then Apple&#x27;s slow and initially reluctant embrace of the &quot;post-PC era&quot; with over-the-air iDevice updates and cloud storage to partly displace iTunes means that it&#x27;s increasingly taking nearly the opposite of Jobs&#x27; 2001 stance: &quot;We&#x27;re clearly migrating away from the PC as the centrepiece&quot; and &quot;We don&#x27;t think of it in terms of the PC business anymore&quot; are things that Tim Cook could say today without really startling anyone.",1430484696

Another factor to consider, if you do really want your Masters now, the bigCo might wind up paying for a lot of it, if you agree to stick around for 1-2 years after they pay for it.

He could be a danger to himself or others. I think you are making it black and white. &quot;If the student wants to stay at school, let them.&quot; It is not as simple as that. Think about it from the other perspective. If he killed himself at school and they knew he had serious mental health issues, people would be way more up and arms. &quot;The school did nothing!&quot;",1430481800

If you have your own solar panels, you need this (or something like it). Even if you don&#x27;t, you can benefit by drawing more power during cheaper off-peak times.<p>2) If lots of people get in on this, we&#x27;ll have the storage capacity we need on the grid to be more dependent on renewable energy. Lack of storage capacity is one of the biggest obstacles to increasing renewable generation.<p>3) If lots of people buy this, the price per unit goes down, and it&#x27;s the most expensive component of Tesla&#x27;s main product, their cars - which are effectively batteries on wheels.",1430481769

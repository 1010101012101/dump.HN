I came to the conclusion that I have <i>almost</i> nothing to lose by applying for jobs and it&#x27;s really difficult to burn bridges by just sending in a resume or a quick email saying I&#x27;m interested in your company.<p>Some of the interviews so far have been excellent and left me really excited about following up with a take-home coding exercise. On the other hand some have left a really bad taste in my mouth. I found it surprising how much I can get a feel for the type of person a CEO/CTO is over the phone. One of my biggest complaints is when interviewers want me to do spec work[1] for their app. That&#x27;s a big red flag for me.<p>My biggest successes so far have come from downloading/signing up for the product or service and spending some time using it. So far interviewers have really enjoyed that and it has led into great discussions about the product and how I would improve it. Furthermore, in remote coding interviews, being honest and saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, could you please show me.&quot; is really appreciated and demonstrates character.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nospec.com/faq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nospec.com/faq</a>",1395241188

The gains that could be achieved by flying even twice as fast isn&#x27;t much compared to the time we could save if we could get to, from and through airports the same way that we move around subway systems: by carrying our own luggage, no check-in, no registration, no reservations, no security, no forced shopping malls, waiting 10 minutes for connections, not several hours.<p>A 2 hour flight, e.g. from NYC to CHI, is often 6-8 hours with all the surrounding nonsense. Getting from Manhattan to JFK, Newark or even LaGuardia is easily 1-2 hours, waiting in the airport, going through security etc. is another 1-2 hours. Getting through the destination airport from the moment the plane touches down and until you are actually leaving the airport with your luggage is rarely less than an hour. And then the transport into the city is another hour.<p>With transatlantic flights it&#x27;s often 14-15 hours or even easily 20 hours if you need a connecting flight in one end, although the connecting flight is &quot;just a one hour flight&quot;, because of all the waiting between flights.<p>Flying is great.

Free bike, but if you don&#x27;t use it or maintain it then it gets transferred to the next person. Only make toast one day a week? Then you get the thing on the day that your usage indicates. Tying this to how much the object is used by peers is a great way to answer the question of &quot;how often should the bike be cleaned or how often should someone use their toaster?&quot;. The idea leads to less waste and more utility for everyone.<p>It&#x27;s not particularly useful to personify machines by giving them emotional states. The toasters in question aren&#x27;t &quot;needy&quot;, they are efficient. The real innovation here is giving an object the ability to take action independently. If I&#x27;m not actively toasting then no amount of analytics or notifications are going to get me to pay more attention to it. Just handle it for me, sell it, upgrade it, downgrade it, replace it with a juicer. Giving me information about my usage is creating more work. Taking action for me is doing me a favor.<p>This whole thing reminds me of Autonomous Corporations [1]. It&#x27;s generally better when things take care of themselves. The Internet of Things combined with intelligent decision making could lead to societies where people have more time and get more benefit from everything around them.

For example, I&#x27;m assuming that with only minimal investment one could produce and submit a series of silent audio tracks. Then one could produce a field of virtualized instances of Spotify and a fleet of bots to &quot;listen&quot; to those tracks. But how expensive would all of that be? And at what scale would the operation be necessary to produce an actual profit, if it could happen at all?<p>According to this article [1] the artist makes about $.004 per play. So, 250 plays comes out to about a dollar and thus 25,000,000 plays comes out to $100,000 which I would consider to be a pretty good outcome for such a quickly baked scam. But that comes out to 7.5 million hours of streaming at 30 seconds per play, and there are what...9000 or so hours in a year? So over 800 years to make $100,000 (pre-tax).<p>Now I suppose it could be ramped up. What if we had 100,000 bots that each streamed a clip for 30 seconds and they ran around the clock. If we play one clip for 30 seconds 100,000 times, simultaneously then we get to 100000/250=$400 worth of plays. So then we could make out 100,000 in about 75 hours. But how expensive would it be to run that many bots all at the same time?<p>Someone please check my math and my assumptions, I&#x27;m sure I did something wrong here.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/19/zoe-keating-spotify-streaming-royalties"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/19/zoe-keatin...</a><p>[edit 1]: also we need to count the hours planning and spinning up the bots in our value calculation..right?",1395240844

Java is intentionally designed to be as close to C syntax as possible, but much easier to get right (garbage collection!).  For a class project, we implemented an object system in Scheme, so I understood OO concepts, again much easier today when it&#x27;s already baked into a language.  Ruby, Python and Javascript don&#x27;t have much beyond what was in Scheme and CL back then in terms of concepts, just maps the same concepts to an Algol syntax.  Prolog concepts show up in various languages from time to time (pattern matching in functional languages seems to match the part of my brain I remember using when writing Prolog).<p>Source code management, IDEs, continuous integration, all things that just make a developer&#x27;s life easier than back then.<p>So, no, frankly, I honestly don&#x27;t think the me of 25 years ago would have much trouble getting up to speed and being productive writing code today.  What the me of today offers over the me of 25 years ago is skills for thinking about big picture design and architecture, building software as part of a team, understanding requirements, estimation and planning.  The technology part, though, certainly isn&#x27;t harder to understand today than it was back then.",1395240800

Who cares?  We work in one of the most diverse fields on the planet.  However, if your blog about Node.js is hosted on &quot;sikh-time.com&quot;, or if you list &quot;homosexual&quot; as the mission statement on your LinkedIn profile, then you are not &quot;refusing to hide&quot;.

That could be an issue for certain religions, such as Sikhs or Hasidic Jews, where outward appearance is a part of it.  However, to clarify... I was not talking about a face-to-face interview, but rather the faceless materials such as resumes and technical blogs that are seen prior to that stage.  Again, the issue is not so much the identity as it is the judgment.

That strategy is not nearly as effective as getting in through a side door - the front door is crowded, and the bottleneck tends to get most candidates ignored. These online applications, with some exceptions, are usually the resumes that get only a few seconds to make an impact - you might lose your reader in the first few sentences (note: I haven&#x27;t worked in big company recruiting from an internal role, but this is pretty widely acknowledged and studies have been released confirming how little time is given to a resume in these conditions).<p>Why do some companies not accept cover letters? For one, nobody wants to read them. Keep in mind, nobody wants to read cover letters OR resumes. They want to have a conversation, and they want to be able to determine as quickly and accurately as possible whether or not that conversation is worth having. This can be quite prone to bias.<p>Most cover letters simply reiterate what the resume says, but in a condensed format, along with some fluff about how hard they work and how strong their soft skills are. It&#x27;s usually fairly pointless, and some companies ask for them as a bit of a test of your interest. Companies that don&#x27;t ask for them likely don&#x27;t feel they are useful, and would rather have their recruiters looking at resumes (and hopefully actually having conversations) than reading traditional formatted letters.",1395240496

I have not been in the industry for 30 years, but I have been programming since a very young age on similar hardware to your Commodore 64. No I cannot translate the skills I learned when writing Basic for that 8 bit architecture directly to the modern web app project I am working on. I can however relate better to memory constrained environments such as Arduino&#x27;s and MSP430&#x27;s. I can say that getting started with a very limited piece of hardware and a very limited language did get my interest peaked to keep exploring what I could do.<p>Later I got into Linux and FreeBSD. While I have never worked with any BSD professionally (other than OS X, but that doesn&#x27;t count), I do think that knowing how FreeBSD works makes me a better Linux user/admin/developer. Certain ideas (kqueue, core system vs packages, etc.) are good concepts to keep in mind when developing for a platform that does not have them.<p>I also learned Turbo-PASCAL and used Delphi for a spell. While not directly relevant, they did have quite an influence on today&#x27;s languages and development environments. NetBeans which I did use professionally for a bit was a far cry form Deplhi but knowing both made NetBeans easier to use.<p>But all that aside, the point of having years of experience is not about enhancing your current knowledge. It&#x27;s about enhancing the process of acquiring knowledge, organizing it, and using it. Someone that knows JavaScript is going to get coded under the table by someone who knows JavaScript, C, Haskell, Erlang, Lisp, Python, etc. In fact I would wager that someone who knew C, Haskell, Erlang, Lisp, and Python but not JavaScript would in the long run beat out a JavaScript expert simply because the penalty to learn a new paradigm is much smaller than perceived, while the benefit of being able to think in a multi-paradigm fashion is a huge benefit.<p>Finally, the mechanic thing: I am comparing a veteran mechanic, with say 20 years experience, including current experience with latest cars vs a mechanic with 1 year experience with just modern cars. I listen to CarTalk, the NPR program, and they had a few very interesting stories on there. For example, there was a woman who called and said that whenever she turned on the fans in her car it smelled like gasoline and it very often happened after she got her car worked on at the dealership. The suggested reason was that when the mechanic worked on it, he put dirty parts on the cowl of the car where the air intake is and some gasoline and oil dripped into it.

Saw the flashing LED?) and then turning on the screen, unlocking the phone, and then checking the notification.<p>For music, it&#x27;s two button presses to get into the music app and and one more to change songs.

Honestly?<p>No offense to Holowaychuk, he certainly does appear to have contributed enormously to the server-side JS ecosystem, but I do not care for JS, so I have not heard of him. This is all assuming he&#x27;s not a collective pseudonym.<p>I agree with the user goldenkey in this thread, and will quote him:<p><i>Most programming jobs are inconsequential bullshit of buzzwizardry and magic frameworks, agile standup chicannery and the dread of dealing with the zesty pimple pricked CS graduate who just loves AngularJS and thinks he can code his way out of a paper bag when he&#x27;s never done reverse engineering. Never made a web scraper. Never messed with shell code or assembly. Never wrote a game hack using hooks/detours. Never written a line of C. Etc etc. Programming is full of happy go lucky adult kids. Real programming is for getting shit done, that&#x27;s all it ever was and will ever be to a seriously learned seasoned programmer. Whether it&#x27;s building something, destroying something, modifying something, binary or source, the seasoned programmer has the skills; but don&#x27;t expect him not to sigh when you bring up your giddiness surrounding menial programming labor for worthless causes; or just plain repeats of the last decade.</i><p>I find it disturbing that &quot;real programmer&quot; is being reduced to a trendy magpie web developer code monkey who goes to hackathons. Lord.<p>Ultimately though, you just have very warped definitions of what this whole thing constitutes. My advice is to relax, keep doing what you love doing and let go of these false ideals.",1395237892

Many states chose not to expand Medicaid, so they will not receive additional federal funding for the program. States that did, however, will.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the law as written, did not leave much of an option for the states to not expand Medicare.

I hadn&#x27;t heard of Unison before, but I recognize the author&#x27;s name from Lambda: The Ultimate, and I suspect that what he has in mind is that any value within the Unison language can appear on any Unison node, transparently.  Instead of picking out exactly which fields you need and then creating new JSONObjects or protobufs for them, just send the whole variable over.<p>I also suspect (being a language design geek, and also having worked with some very large distributed systems) that the reason why this is seductive is also why it&#x27;s unworkable.  I think I probably do spend close to 70% of my time dealing with networking and data formats (and yes, I use off-the-shelf serialization formats and networking protocols), but that&#x27;s because a watch is very different from a phone which is very different from a persistent messaging server which is different from a webpage, and Bluetooth is very different from cell networks which are very different from 10G-Ethernet in a DC.

There are plenty of potential advantages from changing jobs too, depending on the job, so it actually might make a lot of sense to switch.

I used to live in Taiwan, and I have a big bunch of mathematics textbooks from China, as well as some recent math students in my local mathematics classes who grew up in China. Mathematics instruction in China is not at all about memorization, in the sense used in this article. A good book on the topic of mathematics instruction in the United States and China is <i>Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics: Teachers&#x27; Understanding of Fundamental Mathematics in China and the United States</i> by Liping Ma.[1] Her field study, with sponsorship by the United States federal government, made clear that elementary mathematics instruction in China is much richer and deeper and more conceptual than in the United States.<p><i>But the idea of the article is true: When you just memorize, it makes it difficult to apply the principals that you are learning to other situations/problems.</i><p>Yes. To memorize without underlying understanding is no more useful than not memorizing at all. Developing deep understanding of a topic usually brings along with it sufficient memorization of fundamental facts that the problem-solver will be able to solve some problems on the spot, and know when to look things up if needed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematics-Understanding/dp/0415873843"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematic...</a><p><a href=""http://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/amed1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/amed1.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf</a>",1431117802

The idea is before writing a macro, you should try writing it as a function instead. If that is possible, that is usually better, because functions, unlike macros, can be passed around as first-class values, and I think they are easier to debug.<p>You should break that rule only when the behavior can’t be written as a function, such as these cases:<p>• The call needs to avoid evaluating its arguments. For example, the `if` built into the language is sometimes defined as a macro.<p><pre><code>    (if (= (+ 2 2) 4)
      (print &quot;math works&quot;)
      (print &quot;math is broken&quot;))
</code></pre>
If `if` were a function, it would first print both statements, and then return the return value of `print` in whichever branch. By making `if` a macro, it can avoid evaluating the branch that is inapplicable.<p>• The call relies on information about the environment only available at compile-time. Perhaps the macro reads a configuration file on the developer’s computer to decide how to set something up.<p>• You have profiled the program and determined that it is better to run the function at compile-time. For example, you might want to make `(regex &quot;[a-z][a-z0-9]+&quot;)` compile the string to a regular expression at compile-time instead of run-time.",1431117164

The elitism of the public school was to be allowed to continue for a time, if only because so many socialists sent their sons to Eton, but the grammar school was to confer no social advantage on its pupils.  Theoretically at least the path to a university could brand out of a secondary modern school.

The idea is that you give them enough cash that they can be reasonably sure they will find another job before running out, but not as much as you would pay out in salary if they stayed.<p>Imagine your employee base graphed on two orthogonal dimensions: their performance level, and their motivation for working for you.  (In reality, &quot;motivation for working for you&quot; is actually many dimensions, and performance is likely to be somewhat correlated with certain motivations, but this illustrates the point at least.)  The buyout offer doesn&#x27;t affect people who aren&#x27;t financially motivated, so take them out of the equation, and look only at the folks who are strictly financially rational.<p>You can loosely group them into high-performers (those who are known achievers, who always have an offer in hand as soon as they make overtures toward searching), mid-performers (those who pretty much amble along, and for whom the job search provokes intense anxiety, because they typically have to put in 3-6 months of full-time searching to find a new position), and low-performers (those who don&#x27;t do anything and everyone already knows it).  In most companies, the distribution of these is roughly 10-80-10.  You can fire all the low performers; the point of bucketing them into the &quot;low performer&quot; category is that their underperformance is obvious enough that they leave a documented paper trail that makes this unambiguous.  And in a company that&#x27;s run into financial difficulties, the top 10% has probably already left, because they continually get job offers and when your company is going down the tubes, it&#x27;s to their advantage to take them.

If so, the code isn&#x27;t yours to take, and it makes no sense for your co-founders to give away any IP rights (copyrights and potential patent rights).<p>Your narrative tends to cast your partners as distracted by other business ventures, it seems that you are searching for a way to disengage.  If they were savvy, they would not agree to your proposal.  The code base is company property (that is if you have completed the process of corporate formation).  You might believe that your contribution in teh form of code disproportionately exceeds your co-founders contributions.  Had you actually formed a company, assigned the IP to the company, determined the value of each founders contributions in addition to any IP (cash, equipment, space, expertise, time commitments) you would be able to foresee how your co-founders will respond to your proposal.<p>IF I&#x27;m incorrect and you have filed articles of incorporation, drafted bylaws, and executed agreements issuing founders stock, then I suggest you consult with your outside counsel (you know, the attorney(s) who drafted all those agreements for you) to help ensure you don&#x27;t f_ck up the operations of your &quot;profitable home services business&quot;.<p>Suggest you ask yourself the following &quot;why am I walking away from a profitable business?  Especially when I committed to building that business with my co-founders?&quot;<p>Maybe you have realized you don&#x27;t get along and so you want out.  In that case, offer to purchase the code base, and agree to payment terms that provides enough runway for you to generate revenue and pay for the code base over time.<p>Finally, you wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;giving&quot; equity to your co-founders.  You would be issuing equity in exchange for the &quot;home services company&quot; assigning all right, title and interest in and to the code base and any associated IP to your new company.  If your platform is adding value, it makes little sense for them to agree to an assignment.  Instead, they should offer to license it to your new company for royalties, equity, and continued development.<p>Summum Bonum.",1431116226

The vassal had a duty to aid his lord, and the lord had a duty to protect his vassal.  The vassal gave loyalty, and got a secure income in return.  It was a permanent relationship.  To dissolve it, you had to use an axe, rather than a pink slip.<p>Corporate loyalty died when management culture forgot that the company owes duties to its employees in addition to its shareholders.  Defined benefit pensions became defined contribution retirement plans.  Then the employer contribution disappeared.  Health insurance plans dwindled from all medical expenses paid to you paying 80% of the premium, $30 co-pays at every turn, and deductibles that are met midway through the twelfth month of the plan fiscal year, then reset.  Training programs evaporated.  Severance packages got smaller, or vanished.  Even the amount of notice I get whenever permanent layoffs are to occur has become days, rather than months.<p>So there are no more loyal vassals.  We are all mercenaries now.

9513822,comment,9512417,9513502,0,0,swombat,,,"> <i>The lack of structure brings out the worst in human behavior.</i><p>Well, that&#x27;s your experience, and you&#x27;re entitled to it. I&#x27;m finding the opposite. Though describing holacracy as a &quot;lack of structure&quot; seems like a pretty serious mis-statement. Holacracy is extremely structured - way more, and way more explicitly, than most organisations.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like the classic traditional observation that &quot;agile is basically no processes&quot;. Yeah, if you use agile as an excuse to throw out process, you might equate the two. But actually agile (at least at its beginnings) involved a lot more process and rigour than traditional waterfall development. Agile is not an absence of process. Holacracy is not an absence of structure.<p>I guess humans will be humans - which means they will misinterpret, distort, exaggerate, etc, especially when exposed to newness.<p>I have little comment about what holacracy is like to work in, because I haven&#x27;t worked in one. But I started a business that now operates by principles fairly closely related to those underlying holacracy (though the implementation is fairly different). We have <i>less</i> structure than holacracy, however... and yet what I&#x27;m seeing is that quite the opposite of your statement, it is bringing out the best in people.<p>Then again, I&#x27;ve not implemented a fake holacracy for all the wrong reasons. We&#x27;re still in the relatively early days of this sort of culture. There are many more ways to get this wrong than right. Unless the people making this happen are truly committed to creating an open culture, and are doing it for the right reasons (i.e. this is the way they want the business to operate because it&#x27;s good - not &quot;well, this seems like a good tool to get people to be motivated without paying them nyeh nyeh nyeh <i>dr evil laughter</i>&quot;... unless it&#x27;s done right, it will probably be a horrible distortion of what it&#x27;s meant to be. Kind of like what you describe.<p>I think you should consider the possibility that the allegedly holacratic organisation you worked in just got it really badly wrong.",1431115350

9513812,comment,9510806,9513225,0,0,yourapostasy,,,"I agree with you there can be very distasteful aspects of the prepper group, but it&#x27;s like that with pretty much any group of people. The value of what they do and/or the concepts they advocate can be separated from who they are.<p>The further up the ladder of technological development you try to reproduce with prepping, and the longer the timescales of self-sufficiency you work towards, the more you are essentially engaging in an exercise to find out how to reboot civilization to a selected technology level, from another selected technology level. You also find out post-haste that this effort goes rapidly non-linear as you extend those two axes. There are related discussions floating around the Net about what it would take to establish a completely independent space habitat (or extrasolar planetary colony).<p>Due to this dynamic, realistic rebuild-from-apocalypse prepping to current technological levels (or even 1940&#x27;s levels) takes government-scale resources, and a very aggressive low-pass filter on the finances of prepping ensures the population of those preppers who alarm you will only ever be an extremely small and ineffectual group. There are way more imminent threats than this group. As groups go, politicians who vote for the Patriot Act and the increasing militarization of police represent a far more legitimate and immediate threat to you and society than these preppers ever will; anti-vaxxers against, say, polio vaccinations are also far more dangerous.<p>But there are lessons to draw from everywhere and all experiences in life. From the preppers, learning about a measure of self-sufficiency doesn&#x27;t hurt; for many working poor and middle class in the world, greater autonomy from rentier processes in our current incarnation of civilization definitely wouldn&#x27;t hurt. From the politicians, learning the price of centralizing responses to risks instead of delegating responsibility to citizens can be instructive to future generations. Even from the anti-vaxxers, we can learn the value of understanding how to critically assess scientific research on our own.",1431115270

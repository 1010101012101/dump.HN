328426,comment,328177,328177,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, Ted Dziuba always strikes me as pretty much negative about everything.  I don't know him personally, but everything I've ever read by him has been hyper-critical of everybody involved in our industry.  And yet, he's involved in the industry as well (he has some kind of media startup or something, that I don't remember and can't be bothered to look up), and so ought to have a sympathetic view of the trials and tribulations of this life.<p>Attacking everybody and everything just doesn't seem like a healthy way to approach life to me, and whenever I read his articles, I'm tempted to respond in kind and explain what a douche he's being...which is then transferring the unhealthy attitude onto me.<p>I didn't realize uncov was a Dziuba effort, or I would have skipped it.  And next time I will.  Life is too short to spend it railing against everything and everybody, and I certainly don't want to get sucked up into his hate maelstrom.",1223598080
328425,comment,328217,328287,0,0,unalone,,,"Uncov is hilarious mostly when it's exposing just how ridiculous and stupid a lot of the start-up scene is. Dziuba is pretty damn smart, and he makes a lot of good points, and it serves as a great counter to a lot of the TechCrunch-wannabe bloggers out there. I've always enjoyed reading it, and I don't see why a grim economy would make it less funny.",1223598023

The peak in Oct 2007 just barely bested the market peak in 2000, and then like a month later started its slide.

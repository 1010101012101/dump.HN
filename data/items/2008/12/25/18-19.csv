So Python is OO and Haskell is functional, and there are many problems that you solve in an OO style when writing Python and a functional style when using Haskell, and that's OK.  And every once in a while you need to write functional-style code in Python, or OO-style code in Haskell, and that's OK too.  I'm OK, you're OK, we're all OK....",1230231237

409689,comment,408767,408814,0,0,mcfunley,,,"At an old job, I interviewed a few hundred programmers for Windows jobs. Almost every single MSCP could recite .NET esoterica from the test, but could not write a for loop. I am not exaggerating. Eventually I started screening out MSCP's. That test is awful. Getting a MSC* cert is the weak last gasp of the failed professional programmer. It is Rock Bottom. There is nothing left after getting an MSCP, except possibly becoming a comment troll on Jeff Atwood's blog. Nothing makes me more pleased to have left Windows development than the fact that I will never have to have another awkward interview with a ""certified professional.""<p>(I am guessing this girl is legitimately bright--you can't blame a 9 year old for not knowing these ugly facts.)",1230230539

409685,comment,409562,409562,0,0,gyeh,,,"I think part of the fear regarding for-profit aid organizations is this: the pursuit of profit will create an incentive for organizations to follow the money.<p>As a result, more resources would be allocated for the problems in more wealthy nations (ie. cancer), while problems in poorer regions would be neglected (ie. maleria).  The same problem would exist even within a nation through existing class divisions.<p>While this schism already exists today, an increase of for-profit aid organizations/charities will probably exacerbate this divide.<p>In the end, this discussion opens a whole host of ethical issues and philosophical questions.

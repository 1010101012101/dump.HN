The better question is if an systematic testing system for exploitable weaknesses (or a lucky chance finding) could find something like this (either a regression, or a badly implemented new feature) and exploit it -- basically assuming there are going to be errors in implementations.  That&#x27;s understood to be a standard technique in the IC, and a whole industry built around it...  and then, the scale of compromise.<p>There are lots of mitigation techniques for vulnerabilities like this (essentially, devices which are too fast-changing and too difficult to fully trust, but which have to touch sensitive data), but it&#x27;s not as if people can carry around a firewall in their pocket these days, sadly.<p>I&#x27;m certainly re-generating any keys which touched iOS or OSX devices (thankfully very few), and reinstalling OSes, in the interim.",1393077339

7282018,comment,7278214,7281716,5,0,keerthiko,,,"> So can HTML. Would you compare Word to HTML?<p>I don&#x27;t mean to be difficult, but lots of laypeople actually compare HTML and Word for a common purpose, usually for making simple websites. Yes, people actually do generate their front-end page formatting using Word&#x27;s HTML export. Again in that context, it&#x27;s technically comparable (or worth comparing, rather). And they each have their flaws. I have used HTML/CSS for lots of documentation, and experimented with it for styling my resume even though those can be classically considered Word&#x27;s domain. So I actually think comparing HTML and Word is really not that strange for a non-zero number of contexts. Typesetting via &quot;formatting&quot; is a pretty big part of the Word experience, and is a totally worthwhile context in which to compare it to LaTeX.<p>> Customizing LaTeX can be hard, but using it in a straightforward way is no more difficult than HTML.<p>I used LaTeX for every document I created in undergrad, but mostly because I wound up spending hours the first week of every course tuning a document to match the lab report/homework format, and there was a legacy of standards passed down from upperclassmen (ie plenty of nice handholding). After I left college, I&#x27;ve pretty much never wanted to open a LaTeX editor (or Word really, for that matter, because I prefer Google Docs).<p>Typing into LaTeX really is very straightforward, and is far superior for equations and the such, yes. But to start from a blank page, it&#x27;s a nightmare without lots of handholding (or experience) to make your document legible. To some extent, so is HTML/CSS, for lots of things. A lot less so with Word. This is a bit of a contrived example, but I think of this as similar to running a &quot;Hello World&quot; alert window in python+tkinter vs javascript+Chrome on a Windows computer. It&#x27;s amazing how difficult the initial setup and configuration in the python route is (you should try it on Windows if you haven&#x27;t) compared to the &quot;write code, refresh browser&quot; in the js route. Even though the code is possibly less friendly in js, it is actually easier to get up and running with far less handholding. There&#x27;s just so many other things slowing down and making the python+windows experience making it frustrating for a beginner. That&#x27;s how I feel about TeX vs Word.<p>I would bet money most middle schoolers, if given a blank LaTeX editor page and a blank page in Word/GDocs to write just a bunch of math formula (some fractions, arithmetic symbols and some exponents maybe?) would give you something better and sooner with the latter.<p>> In my experience it&#x27;s a lot faster than that.<p>This unfortunately wasn&#x27;t true for me, or for a lot of other people. Maybe large amounts of images, or the wrong image formats, or numerous other causes can make exports slow. I don&#x27;t know the details of why, but it was there, and it sucked. Maybe a side-by-side editor+constant re-render in a custom output format (that&#x27;s optimized for TeX rendering way faster than making a pdf), would be pretty cool, for instance. I don&#x27;t need to export to pdf after every tiny edit after all.<p>> It more commonly takes a minute, not an hour.<p>I&#x27;ll completely admit I got a little overdramatic by that point =]. Sure it&#x27;s more commonly a minute, but it&#x27;s still full of much more &quot;Badness 10K&quot; than I ever had Word throw an Error dialog at me. And in my (weak) defense, I <i>have</i> wound up spending an hour fixing a LaTeX bug from a missed closing brace, and I couldn&#x27;t create the document. and it would have helped if I could have noticed it the moment it happened (as opposed to after my next recompile which took 30 seconds). I feel constant debugging shouldn&#x27;t really have a place in document-writing. Perhaps better error tolerance (a la HTML) and/or debugging would be nice.<p>To sum up: I&#x27;m not trying to put down LaTeX. But it has lackings, which can be addressed. I also wouldn&#x27;t suggest to make LaTeX function like other WYSIWYG/WYSIWYM editor, but to attempt to address the root problem, ie, the feedback-loops times. Lyx tried to do that, but WYSIWYM wasn&#x27;t the right answer (for all the people who still use regular LaTeX editors instead).<p>Well, I actually don&#x27;t even write documents very much anymore so maybe I&#x27;m pretty disconnected from the whole ecosystem for a while, but from what I gather the tools haven&#x27;t really evolved much at all in the last 4 years.",1393076354

Now, that&#x27;s not to say that I shouldn&#x27;t take other things into consideration, like your experience at the time.  Obviously I&#x27;d never expect a junior dev&#x27;s code to look like someone with 10 years experience.  And yes, if you&#x27;re working at a place with terrible coding standards, and for some reason I have access to that code (most of the time those places aren&#x27;t producing open source code), you can explain why everything is static public or whatever.  That&#x27;s fine.

He used the term languages, but also cautioned that they&#x27;re also consistent with different subject matter, different encryption schemes, or possibly just different dialects. He called them Voynich-A and Voynich-B. Interestingly, Voynich-A and Voynich-B are in two different handwritings, though both use the same alphabet and script. Every page of the book is written entirely in either A or B. The Biology and Star sections of the book are written in Voynich-B; the others are written in Voynich-A. The exception is the first and largest section, Botanical, which contains some of each. But they&#x27;re not simply interspersed. The way the book is bound uses bifolios, which are groups of pages folded together, which are then stacked on top of one another to be bound. Each bifolio in the Voynich manuscript is written entirely in one language or the other.&quot;</i>",1393074905

Again, i may be confused by the appearance of the symbols. However the more i look at it, it does look like a code.<p>* On 57v, we can see what appears to be an alphabet sequence in the circles. The sequence is mirrored on the other part of the same circle in the second circle counted from the outside.<p>* Page 66r again has a left-column top-down list of symbols, what looks like a encryption key of sorts.<p>Many clues in the document makes me believe it is unlikely to orginate from america, such as crossbowmen, castles and bath houses.<p>I published a longer write up on my blog, at <a href=""http://martinlindhe.blogspot.se/2014/02/the-other-day-news-broke-about-stephen.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinlindhe.blogspot.se/2014/02/the-other-day-news-b...</a>",1393074238

(I was generating a png from a custom image format.)<p>Because there was so much output, I did a `| head` to keep it manageable. Saw what I was doing wrong, fixed it, reran the command, it seemed fine - but the output image looked exactly the same as it had before.<p>It took me about an hour to realise that once head had exited, the pipeline sent a signal to my program, killing it. The image wasn't getting written until after all the pixels had been processed, so it never got to that stage.",1255096785

871370,comment,870921,871041,0,0,mahmud,,,"Dalai Lama, the slave driver ..<p>Google Tibetan history and see what sorts of ""religious order"" he wants to implement in Tibet. Chinese are an occupying force there, sure, but the Dalai Lama, if he was no the leader of Tibet, would absolutely deserve a coup and summary hanging.<p><i>Earlier visitors to Tibet commented on the theocratic despotism. In 1895, an Englishman, Dr. A. L. Waddell, wrote that the populace was under the “intolerable tyranny of monks” and the devil superstitions they had fashioned to terrorize the people. In 1904 Perceval Landon described the Dalai Lama’s rule as “an engine of oppression.” At about that time, another English traveler, Captain W.F.T. O’Connor, observed that “the great landowners and the priests… exercise each in their own dominion a despotic power from which there is no appeal,” while the people are “oppressed by the most monstrous growth of monasticism and priest-craft.” Tibetan rulers “invented degrading legends and stimulated a spirit of superstition” among the common people. In 1937, another visitor, Spencer Chapman, wrote, “The Lamaist monk does not spend his time in ministering to the people or educating them. . . . The beggar beside the road is nothing to the monk. Knowledge is the jealously guarded prerogative of the monasteries and is used to increase their influence and wealth.”24 As much as we might wish otherwise, feudal theocratic Tibet was a far cry from the romanticized Shangri La so enthusiastically nurtured by Buddhism’s western proselytes.</i><p><a href=""http://www.michaelparenti.org/Tibet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.michaelparenti.org/Tibet.html</a>",1255096766

871340,comment,871158,871158,0,0,nomurrcy,,,"Some users of a (shipped, fairly heavily used) web app we had deployed were getting kicked back to the login screen at random. Sometimes, very frequently.<p>Looking in the logs we could see that these users were somehow losing their authentication cookie and the application was correctly bouncing them to login. So how were they losing their cookie? Assuming it was a bug in the code we searched and searched to no avail.<p>Finally I discovered that the hardware load-balancer our CTO/'IT' guy' had insisted on was the culprit. The load balancer would buffer fragmented requests and re-assemble them before sending them on to the server. Unfortunatly the load balancer had a huge bug in its firmare.<p>If a user was using firefox, on windows, and their request was fragmented such that the first packet contained data up to the end of a header line including the \r but not the \n, so the next packet would start with a \n and then a header name, the load balancer would insert a \n\r between the two packets, thus effectively truncating the HTTP headers, usually before the cookie lines.<p>When I found this bug I couldn't believe that this was actually happening, I thought I was taking crazy pills, but you could run a sniff on the front and back side of the load balancer and see the request go in well formed and come out busted. We ditched the hardware load balancer and all was well.",1255096130

Only I forgot to advance a recordset through which I was looping, so the code never hit the end of recordset condition. It took me some time to notice there was a problem...<p>The fact that I crippled a national SMS network for a few hours was bad.<p>The fact that my company had to pay for each SMS, wiping out out profit for that month was worse.<p>The fact the handset was mine and on my first date with a girl later that evening (whom I later married) my handset kept beeping with incoming text messages (about 96,000 if I remember) was the ultimate.<p>The handset didn't have a silent-no vibrate function (either it beeped or it vibrated or it did both) and the SMS inbox filled up after 200 or so messages meant it took days for the inbox to fill up, me to clear it message by message, then fill up again ad nauseam.<p>Still, I laugh about it now...",1255094787

871286,comment,870240,870488,0,0,elblanco,,,"And how is that use-case unsupported on virtually all other operating systems?<p>One of the nice things (again, IMHO) of the Windows concept (and Linux, and BeOS and <insert any other modern OS> for the most part) is that just because you happen to have a window in focus doesn't mean that the principle OS menus need to completely reconfigure themselves for that one app. The functions of the thing you are working on are supposed to carry around with that object.<p>Under any other possible metaphor, what the Macintosh operating systems have done is madness.<p>>In the physical world, I mix and match media as suits the task, and the Mac mimics that. I don't fill my desk up with a notepad, then hide it and take out a calculator, then hide it and set up my easel.<p>This is the wrong metaphor. The metaphor Apple is using is like separating the pedals, gear shifter and steering wheel from your car, the doorknobs from your house and your office, and all the buttons from your calculator and throwing them into a toolchest that you have to carry around with you everywhere. Whenever you encounter something you need to operate, you open the appropriate drawer in the chest and operate it from there. Need to go get some beer at the convenience store? Open the 3rd drawer and drive your car from inside the drawer. Need to get in your house? Open the doorknob drawer and turn the right one clockwise so your door pops open. Need to use your calculator that you have out? That's the fifth drawer down on the right. Try not to make a mistake while bending down hitting keys, and then bending back up to see if the display on the calc is showing you something you want. Of course it's an Apple toolbox so it's all aqua-ish and shiny with rounded corners and a permanent lens-flair, and it's context sensitive so the right drawer ""just opens"" at the right time so it all appears to ""just work"". But it's annoying as all hell.<p>The interfaces to the device you are intending to operate should be part of the device you are operating.<p>The Macintosh Operating systems have always operated under the assumption of single app focus reconfiguring the toolbars, with clutter from unfocused apps taking up the visual space. I can't even count on all my fingers and toes the number of times I've closed a window in an Apple operating system, but not the App, and thought I was working with an app that was in the background that just happened to have a very similar toolbar - and got supremely frustrated that I couldn't bring that app in focus or do some operation from within the toolbar for the app I very clearly was looking at (and the only one I could see with windows on the screen. The disassociation of tools (methods) from the thing that you are working on (objects) is not only a poor abstraction, it's a usability nightmare.<p>Right now for example, I have my browser open in one part of my screen, a word processor in another, and two file browsers on another monitor. Nothing in the design of my OS is preventing me from copying and pasting from one to the other, or even dragging and dropping items or selections from one program to another. But my OS isn't trying to reconfigure itself to support whatever app happens to be in focus at the moment. But if I want to avoid distractions from the other apps, I can full screen any one of those things and it really is full screen, I won't see anything else on that monitor but that app. On Apple Operating systems it just sorta kinda fits it as best it can, but if the aspect ratio is not quite right or something I'll see other apps hanging out over the edges of my window.",1255094611

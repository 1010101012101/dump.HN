He knows what a block trade is, and how to quote a market. Lewis worked on a bond trading desk, and coined the phrase &quot;equities in dallas&quot;. So it&#x27;s not CFA 1 here for him.<p>To your point: what&#x27;s missing is the hedging costs. The reason block trades trade out of the market is not just that they are &quot;bespoke&quot;, but that there is the inventory hedge risk. It may take some time to build up a position (during which prices can move adversely). And this may or may not need a hedge to protect the holding period (which someone needs to pay for).<p>Various types of trading strategies have very different risk profiles when compared to required inventory hold/periods etc. And this is a hidden source of economics or cost. Hedging doesn&#x27;t always scale well, either.<p>So its very hard (especially as a lay-person) to make inferences about many things unless you are taking into account both profits and risk.

7532698,comment,7532130,7532138,1,0,eshvk,,,"> great culture<p>There is no objective measure of great culture or interesting work. I mean, what is &quot;great culture&quot; to you may not be the same to me. For me, I would rather work in an environment where there is a good measure of self-motivated individuals (who get shit done) with a good balance of thinking towards the future (don&#x27;t experiment too much with a bunch of hipster frameworks that generate a lot of technical debt). And. I like a place that has a great work life balance. On the other hand, there are people who think that great culture means being able to write code in any language, like to work 100 hours a week and who think free food = great culture. Now, I have no problem with that attitude. It is just not my thing.<p>> , interesting work,<p>Interesting work: This is a hard problem. Again, this is dependent on you. If you are fresh out of school, everything may seem interesting to you. On the other hand, maybe you have worked on specific frameworks for a while (say building CRUD apps for a BigCo) and now feel like interesting is working on iOS stuff. Maybe you want to be a full stack engineer. Maybe you want to specialize?<p>> is making money<p>Be wary, if you are at all looking at a startup. Very few of them are profitable. Most will quote numbers about funding, IPOs etc. It makes it hard to understand what 40 million in funding actually means. Does it mean that the startup is going to succeed? What does a 100 billion valuation mean? Does it mean the company is making money?<p>> remote friendly.<p>I think every place in theory is remote friendly for the right candidates. As to whether their culture has ways of workings that make it productive for remote candidates, that is a different issue. If you are a person who is so amazing that you can do your own stuff without face time, almost every tech company will be okay with you being remote. On the other hand, if you are a person who needs to work in a team and work collaboratively, there has to be a culture where the idea that the other person may not be geographically in the same place as you is firmly fixed. E.g. there are small startups in SF where people all come into work at 11 AM and leave at 11 PM. It is a system that works well for them because they all work in sync, talk to each other in person if something needs to be resolved. I like to come to work insanely early, get stuff done, go out and switch off. Some times, I like to get quite time and work from home because I can get a tremendous amount of work done without having to deal with meetings. Again, I wouldn&#x27;t fit well in the environment that I just listed.",1396630504

I suffer from chronic depression and it is not easy to depend on medication every day with no prospect of &quot;cure&quot;. The hardest part is dealing with the stigma associated with it, with people insisting that you are not doing the right thing and finding a way to get over it and free your self from medication.<p>I know that the &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; explanation is a poor excuse for &quot;we don&#x27;t know exactly how it works&quot;. But there are so many progresses done in our quality of living that were done because someone had a hunch and some practical, reproducible results showing that it worked. Think about the practice of washing hands when going from one patient to another in a hospital? When it was suggested, people couldn&#x27;t see a connection with dirty hands and spreading diseases.<p>I lost a son that suffered from a mood disorder to suicide. It  is heartbreaking and it happened when he was apparently getting over the hump of his darkest moments... I have other two children that also struggled with depression and what I found that worked the best for us so far is communication.

Someday...<p>* Run. I run 3-4 nights per week, either along Embarcadero or through Golden Gate Park.

Very fun way to meet new people.<p>* Biking - Go to Roaring Mouse bikes in Crissy Field (<a href=""http://www.roaringmousecycles.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.roaringmousecycles.com/</a>) and buy a bike. Then bike to work, bike to Golden Gate Park, bike across the GG bridge to Sausalito, to Tiburon, to Marin.

Find a problem domain you know something about, and solve that problem. Get out there, meet some co-founders, crank out some code, save the world, and get the cheerleader.

I currently have 3 different ones: a Roth IRA (I used to put in $400/mo, but now only do $200/mo if I can...the next accounts are all automatic though and I don&#x27;t skip those), the 2nd is a 403b (similar to a 401k, but available for people in the public sector) which I put $1000 into pre-tax, and the 3rd is my life insurance/savings account which I put $400 into each month (this is a bit extra on top of the regular premium so it&#x27;ll build value as an additional income source I can tap into down the road). Both 1 and 3 are after taxes and #2 is my only pre-tax one. My savings account right now isn&#x27;t too great partly because so much goes into the future retirement accounts, but I try and put another $300/mo into that if I can, but some months I end up tapping into that due to extra expenses that come up. (Sounds like maybe we should have a separate thread on how much people put away each month and their reasons for doing so :-).<p>I think some of the others are correct though, you can definitely start now in your free time with at least creating some accounts and started to do a little bit (the key thing would be being consistent with those actions...as an example, I&#x27;ve always been an HN consumer, but I hardly ever commented...now I&#x27;m making an effort to add my own thoughts to posts and share what I have to say because I&#x27;d like to build up my karma :-).<p>I agree with your comments though that it&#x27;s hard to demonstrate your skills and capabilities to employers when all you have is your resume and not these ancillary profiles and public information spots that seem to be used a lot in determining whether someone&#x27;s skills are adequate.<p>Since I work in a college IT department I feel like I&#x27;m automatically ruled out because of my background even though I always include a list of the various projects I&#x27;ve worked on over the past 6 years and the increasing levels of responsibility I&#x27;ve acquired.<p>The other negative I have is I&#x27;m probably my own worst critic and don&#x27;t always see my own accomplishments in their best light (I&#x27;ll think to myself, &quot;Self, well you don&#x27;t really have any Ruby on Rails experience so that automatically disqualifies you from all of these jobs, let&#x27;s see what else is available...&quot;. That&#x27;s kind of a self-imposed problem where I need to do a better job of selling myself.<p>Actually right now, even though I enjoy my job quite a bit, all I&#x27;d really want is the ability to tap into some of the knowledge of Silicon Valley to learn new things (by working part-time remotely and maybe sometimes in person with a company) that I just can&#x27;t learn here so I can bring those into my current job and apply them, but there don&#x27;t seem to be too many employers looking for that (though if you know of any, please point me too them :-).<p>Since I&#x27;m way out in stix of SoCal, next to the border, in the desert, in the middle of a mainly agricultural community to have access to all of the good employers/jobs I&#x27;d have to move up to the Bay, which isn&#x27;t too bad (but it&#x27;s SOOO expensive). I don&#x27;t mind where I live so much...I just mind that the learning opportunities I have are so limited (so I end up having to find my own ways to teach myself, but that process is a lot slower than having a teacher, aka a willing co-worker, help guide you).<p>Key takeway though from this thread so far: Don&#x27;t cash out your 401K and possibly put your family in a precarious position. Having a Happy Dad is important, but so is providing for your family. I would start small and be consistent with the activities you mentioned and treat them like projects. While I tend to forget (until I remember)...if you&#x27;re consistent with your actions over a period of time you&#x27;ll be amazed at how much you&#x27;ll accomplish (of course this is compounded by family time, which takes away from the time you could use, but even if there&#x27;s just one day a week that you can have some &quot;Daddy Alone Time&quot; that everyone is aware of, and the wife can be your buffer, then that&#x27;d be a good start :-).<p>Good luck buddy (it&#x27;s tough I know!)",1396630085

The presence of a 100,000 order changes the supply/demand conditions for XYZ. For RBC to expect to sell 100,000 shares at the current bid, it must expect to get something for nothing: to take the price hit for the increased demand of XYZ out of the hide of whoever is holding it right now.<p>Before HFT mania, &quot;front-running&quot; meant something very specific: it was a problem of agency. A client/broker relationship existed, and the broker exploited it by trading in front of their client&#x27;s order. The client had a right to expect the broker to act in their best interests. But the markets as a whole aren&#x27;t a positive-sum system; in the absence of a contractual relationship, nobody has an obligation to act in the interests of anyone else.

She doesn&#x27;t trade with an HFT and instead takes the risk that a buyer never shows up or that the market moves against her. This is equivalent to an add-liquidity-only order. She won&#x27;t be crossing the spread, and she therefore she won&#x27;t pay the bid-ask spread.<p>It&#x27;s the same thing if you&#x27;re buying. If you don&#x27;t want to pay for liquidity you don&#x27;t have to. You state your price, say you&#x27;ll only add liquidity, and when a seller comes along who&#x27;s willing to give it to you at that price, you&#x27;ll be matched.",1396628935

I was a fairly good typist, so I would finish the assignment as quickly as I could and then play games on the computer. The teacher wasn&#x27;t very happy with this and wanted me to continue typing. So, in frustration and boredom, I just typed a bunch of spaces and was quite surprised when it accepted it as correct. I told a few of my friends about this and it quickly spread. The teacher became suspicious of the scores, and I got blamed for discovering the flaw. The teacher then decided she had to watch me complete every one of the typing excercises to make sure I wasn&#x27;t cheating. Luckily for me, after a few weeks of that she let me go back to completing the assignments quickly and playing games. I still wish my school would have had a more knowledgeable computer teacher to push me to do programming excercises or something more productive than wasting that time playing games.",1396628933

Presumably, there are individual biochemical differences in either drug receptor sites on nerve cells or in metabolism of the drug after ingestion that make some kind of treatment difference, but there are not convenient medical tests yet to predict which kind of patient will respond to which drug. When I advise friends about pondering different medical treatments for most disease, my pickling in the research on human behavior genetics in the weekly journal club I attend suggests that you look to what works for your close relatives. If a particular medicine seems to be helpful with few side effects for a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child), give it a try. If a particular drug has been useless for someone closely related to you, for whatever condition you are concerned about, start your search with some other drug. And so on. Eventually we MAY get to a deeper genetic understanding of individual differences in response to prescribed medicines, but we are a long way from that so far.",1396627644

The article &quot;The Biodemography of Human Ageing&quot; by James Vaupel,[2] originally published in the journal Nature in 2010, is a good current reference on the subject. Vaupel is one of the leading scholars on the demography of aging and how to adjust for time trends in life expectancy. A lot incremental improvements in both public health and in medical practice, as well as much better nutrition than in the old days, are steadily increasing life expectancy.[3] This is happening for people of all ages; life expectancy at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages is still rising, and all-cause mortality and morbidity declining, throughout the developed countries of the world.[4]<p>So the monkey research needs to be meshed in with human research that shows that mildly &quot;overweight&quot; (if fit) human beings have better mortality outcomes than human beings of normal weight[5] to tease out what the causation is for health outcomes of different patterns of nutrition. The example of Rimonabant[6] shows that sometimes an animal model doesn&#x27;t adequately predict treatment effects in human subjects.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity....</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2860ef54d218ce5ce19abe6a59/dc_biodemography_of_human_ageing_nature_2010_vaupel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_longevity/2013/09/life_expectancy_history_public_health_and_medical_advances_that_lead_to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box/scientificamerican0912-54_BX1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23280227"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23280227</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19578688"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19578688</a>",1396627357

Store the files in a directory not served by a webserver, and use a small bit of code to read the file and send it to the user.<p>I always run my code such that the webserver has read only access to any directory it will serve. This helps limit exploits since the attacker has no ability to write anything and then have it execute. (Not a panacea of course, if you have a large enough bug, the attacker could write to /tmp then exec the code.)",1338764398

Your comment smacks of condescension but I'm sure you can just provide citations. Your (wikipedia) article contains some arguments based on relative frequency of symbols, but is controverted by studies of modern pictographic languages with similar characteristic (e.g. Chinese.)<p><a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/324/5931/1165"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/324/5931/1165</a><p>You also mentioned the Brahmi script is ""unquestionably based on the scripts of the ancient Near East"". That is also news to me. Could you provide citations, please?<p>The real controversial implication, IMHO, of studying ancient Indian languages is that Sanskrit (used over thousands of years and refined by rigid grammar rules by e.g. Panini 500 B.C.) may actually be the language from which Latin, and hence many European Romantic languages, developed.<p><a href=""http://mutiny.wordpress.com/2007/02/09/sanskrit-mother-of-european-languages-says-prof-dean-brown/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mutiny.wordpress.com/2007/02/09/sanskrit-mother-of-eu...</a><p>That's probably worth diving into, if you are genuinely curious.

4061921,comment,4061770,4061813,1,0,caw,,,"> I've interviewed a guy from IBM before. He insisted on commenting everything and having getters and setters for all of his fields.<p>A co-worker of mine used to work for IBM. He said he commented everything. However, he wrote them in Spanish. So your code comments should be appropriate for the environment :)<p>> Being in a company has a lot to do with how well you get along with people. You're new, and so I suggest that you listen carefully, ask questions about things that you don't understand (otherwise you'll feel like a dumbass next time they bring it up, and you still don't know what they're talking about).<p>Definitely do this. If someone mentions an acronym or project, either interject or remind yourself to ask later what it is. Which one is appropriate obviously depends on the context of the situation.<p>> When you've been working somewhere for a while you also tend to dismiss the problems around you. Make sure you note down all of the things that you find wrong about the place - ask people why these things are they way that they are - it could be a misunderstanding on your part, but it could also be that there are genuinely things that need fixing.<p>There are a lot of things done because ""that's the way they are"" and no one questions that. You should probably question why. Sometimes things are done that way because it was the best solution at the time. However, technology and use cases change.<p>> Make sure you keep a notepad on you - note down everything that you learn, problems that you see etc - it'll come in handy.<p>You can also make notes about people. Where they are in the org chart, what they're responsible for, who referred you to them, and maybe even some of their info, like they're a fan of a particular football team or something. That info can help you make small talk and fit in with the group faster. You'll meet too many people too quickly to internalize it all at one time, so the notes will help as a temporary crutch (don't be a stalker, and don't write anything you wouldn't want anyone to read). Along those lines, sometimes you just have to initiate joining a group. You can't always wait for them to invite you in.<p>> After a couple of weeks you can start acting on fixing the problems that you've seen - if you actively seek to solve problems, then you can become a hero in the company - the guy that made our lives better.<p>This is true. I've seen it happen.<p>> Lastly remember that if you want something you'll have to fight for it. Don't be afraid to disagree with people, but you have to play a fine game when you've just come into the company - you don't want to piss people off, but you also don't want to set the expectation that you're OK with shitty code.<p>We have a philosophy where I work called ""disagree and commit.""  There are too many opinions from too many people to ever work out everything ahead of time. Sometimes you have to just say ""I disagree with this idea, but I accept we've decided to go this way, and I'll give it 110%."" The trick is knowing when to hash it out some more and when to just shut up and get something done. There are many more problems to be solved, and you can't win every battle.",1338762562

4061917,comment,4061568,4061749,5,0,Niten,,,"Likewise, I'll defer to anyone who can present hard data to the contrary, but my intuition is that you're spot on here.<p>I've always been a geek.  When I was 12 my father's coworker gave me a BASIC compiler, and I would stay inside working through introductory programming tutorials while my equally intelligent sister spent her free time with her friends.  As a result, by the time I graduated high school I already had significant experience programming in BASIC, C, C++, Perl, JavaScript, and Z80 assembly language (TI-86 graphing calculators).<p>Now when I got to college I still had plenty to learn about the theoretical underpinnings of computer science, but one thing I noticed right away was that my six-year, passionate head start on programming gave me a massive advantage over many of my peers.  The ones who lacked this advantage eventually switched majors; the ones who had it stayed... and were invariably male.<p>I propose that the phenomenon of so many kids entering computer science and engineering programs with years of self-taught experience under their belts has unconsciously shaped these programs to the point that they are unfriendly to anyone trying to start programming from scratch.  And maybe that in itself isn't a bad thing; if CS programs can assume a certain level of experience from new students, then perhaps they can produce graduates with an even higher level of education.  Generally speaking it's not gender discrimination we see in these programs, it's experience discrimination.<p>If we're to go searching for the cause of the gender gap in software engineering, I think we need to stop trying to assign blame to phantasms of gender discrimination in higher education  or worse, trying to just shoehorn more young women into a career path for which they are not necessarily prepared.  Instead, we need to look at the social factors that lead so many more boys than girls to engage programming at a young age, and discuss what might be done about that.",1338762497

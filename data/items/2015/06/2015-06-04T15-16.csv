The prank went on long enough that people wanted to see how long they could keep it going.<p>It was eventually spoiled when someone from the neighboring company witnessed the new guy entering the 16 digit code and pointed out the code was only 4 digits.

9660089,comment,9658664,9659178,0,0,iamcurious,,,"Yes, instead of seeing time as a point, there is a culture of seeing it as a range. The range is derived from context (how pissed people will be if you are late/how informal is the event). The range might even be different for different people according to their roles. This gives you a buffer to handle many unexpected things. It also allows you to disassociate urgent from important. There are plenty of important things that get done at the expense of arriving late. True, sometimes you have to wait for other people to arrive, but that is expected, so you can arrange your day around it. And when the time comes you know it is okay for them to wait you. It is efficient once you get the hang of it. It is even more efficient now that smartphones are ubiquitous, you can coordinate the range in real time!",1433433172

9660038,comment,9659900,9659900,0,0,pron,,,"Sure, feudalism is a form of decentralized government, but what lies at its very heart -- the core of feudalism, if you will -- is the ability to own people via obligations they make because they have no choice, and cannot free themselves from. Freedom is a continuum, but only a fool would claim that feudalism brings more freedom to more people than a centralized, democratic government. What is often absent from reactionary accounts of history, is how few in number, how incredibly rare were the people who were able to enjoy those forms of government. The manorial system -- feudalism&#x27;s economic system -- is mentioned in the article in passing, but it was only made possible by serfdom, a form of slavery. The vast majority of people were serfs -- had to be for feudalism to work -- and they lived on the brink of starvation so that their lord could eat.<p>Feudalism is a rather natural form of organization that arises wherever there&#x27;s a lack of central governance. In the late 19th century, a form of modern feudalism emerged in the US, under the control of the robber barons. Because of lack of regulation, corporations were able to own people, paying them with non-convertible company currency so that they couldn&#x27;t leave. It was only when the population cried for freedom, with the help of some pioneering journalists, that the US government stepped in with regulation that freed the people.",1433432657

Of course cheating is decently common in all cultures, my point was that I didn&#x27;t feel that cheating was respected as a sign of cleverness in Chinese culture, more that if there&#x27;s just huge pressure on you to get high marks, win, etc., and little focus on other side goals, then cheating is sort of a natural side effect.<p>For example, in high school and university, most of my friends had parents who wanted them to do well grades-wise, but also wanted them to focus on other things like their social life, hobbies, and developing a passion in a specific area.  Low grades wouldn&#x27;t draw any more concern than not socializing much, not having hobbies, etc., and a &quot;well rounded&quot; life with mediocre grades was general seen as &quot;my kid&#x27;s doing well.&quot;<p>Among my Chinese friends, it was more common for their parents to focus on grades above all else.  The parents weren&#x27;t that interested in the side goals, they really just applied huge pressure to their kids to get the highest grades.  The kid could be doing all sorts of awesome things, but if their grades were mediocre, their parents were generally pretty disappointed.<p>I figure it&#x27;s more likely something like this with the Baidu team - major pressure to win, above all else, that would drive the cheating, vs. cheating being seen as some positive sign of cleverness.",1433432605

If you were say, creating the next LinkedIn and you wanted to find the shortest path between two users based on their connections, a graph database would be a good choice.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine you want to see how Fred is connected to Steve, their network looks like this:<p><pre><code>    [Fred] <-knows-> [Bob]
    [Bob] <-isMarriedTo-> [Sally]

Diagram: <a href=""http://yuml.me/6ff3074e"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yuml.me/6ff3074e</a><p>A &quot;traditional&quot; database like MySQL or Mongo makes this kind of query prohibitively expensive and complicated, as it must perform a new join for every connected person in the user&#x27;s graph.<p>Graph databases come into their own because they are designed specifically for efficient traversal of these connecting edges. They typically do this by storing &quot;pointers&quot; on each vertex to its connected edges, so while a normal RDBMS requires something like a hash table lookup to resolve a join, a graph database can simply &quot;jump&quot; to the relevant record via a pointer. This means that things like Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm [0] can be implemented efficiently.<p>However, &quot;traditional&quot; graph databases like Neo4j require everything to be structured in terms of vertices and edges. This is often quite inconvenient, so Multi Model databases like ArangoDB integrate this graph approach with a document store as well, the idea being that if you can keep everything in the same db your app gets a <i>lot</i> simpler, you regain things like ACIDity that you&#x27;d normally lose by using 2 separate dbs, and performance should be a lot better too.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm</a>",1433431647

Providing internet access at testing sites would help somewhat, but if you have grown up in an environment where the internet was not as ubiquitous as some of us are used to, you may not have the Google-fu or knowledge of Internet research methodology necessary to compete with those in wealthier areas.

I think this is at the root of the low-carb approach in which the foods that you eat don’t stimulate your body’s fat-making hormones.<p>If your body is being asked to make fat (through raised insulin levels), it doesn’t matter how many calories you eat, they are mostly being stored and you will continue to be hungry.<p>Low-carb helps you eat fewer calories because more of the calories you eat are available for energy and your body will signal that you are satiated.<p>If you want to go <i>really</i> low-carb, you can go into ketosis, where your body realizes it can also start eating its own fat for energy and promptly does so. Then you are satiated on even fewer calories because your body can get what it needs from itself.<p>I’ve found ketosis to be very reliable and even better, I find I <i>concentrate</i> much better because I’m not so distracted by how I’m going to get my next snack to much while I code.

There is no fallacy standards body that arbitrates normative definitions of fallacies.</i><p>Only there is.<p>The fallacies are what they are because people listed them, gave them fancy latin names, put them up on the internet, and argue about them.<p>Average Joe doesn't use fallacy listings. Neither he maintains them. The ""fallacy"" thing is mostly confined in the ""sceptic"" / ""more logical than thou"" communities on the intertubes. (Of course the starting origin of the fallacies is in actual philosophers and logicians).<p>As for the ""argument from authority"", Wikipedia backs me up on this one (If I'm allowed to appeal to its authority):<p>><i>Fallacious arguments from authority often are the result of failing to meet at least one of the required two conditions (legitimate expertise and expert consensus) structurally required in the forms of a statistical syllogism.[1][2] First, when the inference fails to meet the first condition (inexpert authority), it is an appeal to inappropriate authority, which occurs when an inference relies upon a person or a group without relevant expertise or knowledge of the subject matter under discussion.</i><p>This is what I said exactly, that in that case you do have a fallacy, but it's actually ""appeal to non-authority"" (in Wikipedia: ""to inappropriate authority"").<p>><i>Second, because the argument from authority is an inductive-reasoning argument  wherein is implied that the truth of the conclusion cannot be guaranteed by the truth of the premises  it also is fallacious to assert that the conclusion must be true.[2]  Such a determinative assertion is a logical non sequitur, because, although the inductive argument might have merit  either probabilistic or statistical  the conclusion does not follow unconditionally, in the sense of being logically necessary.</i><p>This is the gist of the other thing I said. Even if the criteria of expertise, non bias, consensus, etc, are met, it is still a fallacy to think that the appeal to authority necessary implies truth.<p>E.g in your example:\nX is a doctor.\nX is unbiased.\nX believes Y on the matter.\nThe medical consensus is Y on the matter.\nTherefore Y is true.<p>Is a fallacy. Consider how the medical community thought of a lot of BS in the past as true, which later was found wrong.",1367834232

That experience has value because you cannot earn it any other way.</i><p>If I put a pound coin in a fire, it doesn't become valuable to put your hand in the fire just because there's no other way to get it. You might, after being burnt, rationalise it as valuable because it had cost you dearly. It might even become a ritual; a way to prove that you were a manly man who liked money or something, <i>'I'm tough, look at me make small gains at massively disproportionate costs.'</i> I don't know. However, beforehand, it would seem insane to value the pound in the fire above a pound that someone else might offer you in its stead without the risk of getting maimed.<p>Difficulty in attaining something makes sense for fashion, because it displays your fitness. However, the worth of things doesn't scale along every axis of value in proportion to the suffering or cost involved in attaining them - and I don't see how the suggested measure is of worth with respect to experiences that have nothing but age to recommend them. As far as experience goes, it seems that the experiences should be worth something for what they give you - whether that be hedons or skills or whatever - and that age is part of the cost you're paying.<p>They're going to cost you something you're never going to get back, a portion of your life, and the return shouldn't just be that they've cost you something.<p>The idea behind age seems to be that it's been pretty darned expensive and they must have bought something valuable with their lives because ... <i>well, look at how much they spent.</i> But that's not how spending works - people buy extended warranties and the like all the time. Maybe they're just bad consumers.<p><i>> Knowledge, tolerance, sacrifice, endurance, and perspective perhaps? When you are 50 you will have some of the same things simply due to the fact that you lived to that age. Older folks are human and make many mistakes just like every other human.

He's never had the opportunity to learn to fight properly because he's never put in the work to find decent teachers and then to practice diligently. He's never really had the opportunity to learn a great number of things about a great number of areas because he's never learnt the pre-requisites.<p>I suppose it's true enough that they show up as potentials if you go far enough down the tree of choices that he might make and might previously have made. That he could have made better choices to net himself wider/more interesting parts of the tree. But he's followed one path through life on which those things didn't show up.<p>Some opportunities multiply as they're seized, and if you never seize them then your range of opportunities is only ever linear with respect to time.<p><i>> If you're having trouble seeing this point of view, compare your abilities and life experience to that of a 10 year old.

6597492,comment,6596038,6596038,2,0,chaostheory,,,"I feel the dislike of Microsoft stems from two major things:<p>1) Its history both when it was dominant and even with recent stuff like trying to force always on DRM with xbone. Techies at large just distrust MS. In MS&#x27;s defense, I feel that both Apple and Google are working their way to the same place, a lot more slowly but surely.<p>2) The difficulty of developing in Windows while not using the MS stack. Sure, it&#x27;s gotten a lot better over the years, but it&#x27;s still not as easy as using OSX or some Linux distro. Even when you do use the Windows stack you get burned, I&#x27;ve known former VB devs as well as .NET devs who were with the Windows 8 transition. Your open source eco-system also really sucks, leading to a lot of unnecessary re-inventions of the wheel, which I don&#x27;t have to do when using other tech stacks. (Codeplex was really too little and too late.)<p>I also think the second point is why there&#x27;s not as much hate for Google and Apple, since their main offerings just work better from the techie perspective.",1382515111
6597491,comment,6597392,6597392,5,0,comex,,,"Why should Apple be suddenly forced to abandon their platform and create their apps on the web just because they connect to online services?  Maps.app is a great smooth, native experience.  Google&#x27;s new WebGL maps are equally smooth in Chrome, which is impressive (the old ones didn&#x27;t come close), but they&#x27;re not native, and they&#x27;re not what Apple has so much expertise with.<p>(I&#x27;m not so sure about iBooks, though; while anyone not on one of Apple&#x27;s preferred Maps platforms can just use Google Maps, iBooks hold purchased content hostage with DRM.  This is why I don&#x27;t use iBooks.  On the other hand, it&#x27;s not like a &quot;open web&quot; app would be a good solution to this, since it would be just as annoying as the app to anyone wanting to customize their reading experience; getting rid of DRM would work better and make it pretty much OK for Apple to ignore other platforms.  Maybe someday...)<p>Note that Apple is working on iWork for iCloud, so it&#x27;s not ignoring the web entirely.",1382515081

I were thinking of a way of somehow not requiring input yet providing passwords without plaintext storage.<p>What would <i>actually</i> work I guess would be storing a hash of <the password, a unique string provided through https auth>. So for the first time the browser would hash the pass and afterwards just provide the pass to the server as a hash without requiring input, acting as a normal pass to the server. However, that would either require some sort of universal agreement among browsers to work, which is tricky to require, or some browser-server protocol in which the browser would only carry such procedure to supported servers. If a supported server is accessed through a non-supported browser, the server itself would perform the hash.<p>Probably too much of a hassle just in name of abolishing plaintext passwords on browsers, but I couldn&#x27;t think of anything simpler. However, fun to imagine :)<p>Obs: This would have the extra bonus of depriving knowledge of plaintext passwords to servers (in case they are compromised, the attacker would not get to try the pass across other services) and preventing password extraction through impersonation of webpages (although this is already guaranteed by https to some extent).",1382512773

It might work if your entire coding team has that innate understanding, but that is unlikely.<p>Sometimes I think that having deep and expert understanding of a language may cause you to create code that other team members cannot understand... not on purpose, but due to your assumption that these are common knowledge (whether they should be or not isn&#x27;t the issue.)",1382512660

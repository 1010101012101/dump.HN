Prior to that the idea that there were fundamental differences wasn&#x27;t toxic, but I fully agree that it was also often taken too far. I consider the current stance a <i>massive</i> overreaction, but there <i>was</i> something to react to. I don&#x27;t think the facts have ever justified current academic orthodoxy and rather fully expect it to be looked back on as something as bizarre as pholistigon, but as we sit here in the middle of it, it&#x27;s much harder to see how bizarre it is.<p>So to me, the revolutionary bit has nothing to do with &quot;new facts&quot;... the revolutionary bit is if it established to the point where current orthodoxy can no longer resist it.<p>And in the meantime, as someone who truly enjoys science in its real form as a permanent, ongoing intellectual revolution rather than a servant of the orthodoxy, the staggering vista of <i>quantitative</i> research this opens up into the diversity (the <i>real</i> diversity, not the political kind) of the human experience is incredibly exciting. There&#x27;s rich veins of knowledge to be mined here with modern technology and techniques.<p>And I&#x27;d make that meta-reply in general to a lot of the other comments... yes, frankly the general gist of this has long been obvious to anyone with an independent mind who takes a look out at the world around us, but if it&#x27;s so obvious, why has the scientific orthodoxy not matched that? The surprise expressed in this article is real. And I mean that as a true question for thought and examination, not mere snark. It&#x27;s a rich question, about science, about how science works, about history, all sorts of things. Books could be written on it, and probably will be.",1399038928

One of the earliest submissions (430 days ago)[1] had well over 100 comments. My comment at the time linked to the full paper[2] by the original authors, which was one of many papers I discussed with professors of psychology (most of whom do their research in the framework of behavioral genetics)[3] that school year in the journal club I attend at my alma mater university.<p>Plainly, basing psychological research on subjects who are mostly undergraduates at United States universities is not a good idea, and there are now increasing efforts to broaden the samples of human beings used to investigate general human characteristics. Cross-cultural validation was considered very important in studies of personality psychology even before this paper was published,[4] for example.<p>Anyway, this perspective comes easily for me, as an American who has lived in a non-Western country for six years of my life (with knowledge of the language, the classical literature, and the traditional culture). Definitely the United States is not the center of the Universe. The study authors referred to people from Western cultures, who were Educated, and who live in Industrialized, Rich, Democracies as &quot;WEIRD&quot; people, and of course that acronym marks out a minority of the world population. I am part of that minority, but I have seen how non-Western, (then) less educated people lived as their country made a transition from being agricultural, poor, and dictatorial to being industrialized, rich, and democratic, and along the way the local culture changed as local conditions changed.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5282343"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5282343</a><p>[2] Henrich, J., Heine, S.

7685541,comment,7679822,7684227,2,0,userbinator,,,"Right, I was assuming x86 (since that&#x27;s what Linus was describing). Indeed it is true a lot of older RISCs had MMUs that need a lot of &quot;hand-holding&quot; in software. I think it&#x27;s fortunate that x86 didn&#x27;t go this route, as evidenced by the increasing cost of context switches, since that basically requires flushing the pipeline and switching to a completely different instruction stream, while an automatic TLB, like a cache, doesn&#x27;t interfere when it misses -- an OoO/superscalar design can continue to execute around it, if there are other instructions that don&#x27;t depend on the miss.<p>A software-managed TLB involves switching contexts and executing instructions in a TLB miss handler (the fetching of which could cause cache misses too), then switching back to the instruction that was interrupted. Compare that to just internally dispatching a memory read or two more, and you&#x27;ll probably see why soft TLBs seem to have fallen out of favour; even if context switches could be done with no overhead, that extra cost of fetching, decoding, and executing instructions can&#x27;t be recovered. (As that old saying goes, &quot;The fastest way to do something is to not do it at all.&quot;)<p>Looking a bit more into it, MIPS is the most widely-used CPU that still has a &quot;soft TLB&quot;. The other popular RISC, ARM, is automatic like x86.",1399037703

And even though it seems reasonable to say<p>&quot;The relative purchasing power of the money in the test is significant within cultures, let alone across cultures.&quot;<p>I am not convinced that is correct.  A quote from the paper describing the study [1] suggest that the amount of money is not crucial<p>&quot;Indeed, in the UG, raising the stakes to quite high levels (e.g., three months’ income) does not substantially alter the basic results. In fact, at high stakes, proposers tend to offer a little more, and responders remain willing to reject offers that represent small fractions of the pie (e.g., 20%) even when the pie is large (e.g., $400 in the United States). Similarly, the results do not appear to be due to a lack of familiarity with the experimental context. Subjects often do not change their behavior in any systematic way when they participate in several replications of the identical experiment.&quot;<p>The point of the article is that it is the norm to conduct studies where participants are selected from the same non-representative sub-population, and that this methodology is heavily biased.

The only reason we can communicate successfully on radio is because someone is regulating who gets to use what and how. The AirChat proposal mentions using the Yaesu FT-897D for test transmissions.

If the FCC didn&#x27;t set aside radio frequency bands for non-commercial use, this project would be infeasible because the radio bands would be in use already. The FCC and its ilk is the only real reason that ham operators can operate - the frequencies have been set aside for licensed amateur use.<p>2) &quot;transmissions are anonymous&quot; but only in data - radio location is as old a location technology as radio itself. Many GA aircraft still use radio beacons as fallback when GPS and VOR signals go down. It&#x27;s simple, anybody can do it, and unless you&#x27;re on the move, you will be found.<p>3) &quot;We don&#x27;t give a fucking shit about prohibitions over the use of encryption. fuck you NSA.&quot; And yet it&#x27;s probably not the NSA who will care the most, but the FCC (ironically the group with the specialized equipment vans capable of finding you). Worse, if too much non-licensed, encrypted communication happens over radio (especially the frequencies reserved for ham radio), it&#x27;s possible that the FCC will revoke the non-commercial use of the airspace, which would cause a whole host of other problems. That frequency space (which includes a number of harmonic frequencies throughout the radio spectrum from ULF to UHF) is ridiculously valuable, because it&#x27;s a finite and highly contested resource.<p>I applaud the concept and idea, and cringe over the consequences and ignorance thereof.",1399036109

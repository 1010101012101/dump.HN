Engineering or science is a far more common background among national leaders in Europe and Asia - and this may turn out to provide  a massive competitive advantage over the US in the future.  Thomas Friedman in ""the world is flat"" mentions this possibility a few times.<p>I voted for Barak, and I'm happy to have him as my president.  But actions speak a lot louder than words.

(paraphrased)<p>--<p>When he was a graduate in an MBA program he invented a program that would allow students to upload papers over the Internet to their teachers.  He showed it to some schools and VCs and they wondered why anyone would need that.  However, a teacher thought it was a great idea, and Blackboard was born.<p>He tried to raise money from several VCs, but they turned him down.  “I went to 50 meetings with 50 different VCs and I can assure you VCs do not invest in companies that are looking for money to develop their product.”<p>They found an investor that was a friend of a friend’s brother’s sisters’ wife’s husband…  they heard he might invest in the space, and kept harassing him until he said yes.<p>Early on they found another company doing the same thing (a bunch of graduate students as well) and they merged together doubling the size of the company.<p>For him it was all about sales.  To get started they gave away the product to 2 schools.  Then sold it super cheap to 2 schools.  From there they sold it to ten at full price, and so on.<p>If you can sell it once, you can sell it ten times, if you can sell it ten times, you can sell it 100 times.<p>A lot of teachers approach him and say “I really want to come work for you.  The online education space is the future.”  He asks two questions: can you program?  Can you sell?  If you can’t do either then you don’t bring any value to the company.<p>The product is never finished.  When BB started to grow, they had competitors with better products.  It didn’t matter.  They outsold the competition (and eventually bought them out.)<p>FB, Twitter, Google they won the lottery.  Companies can win the lottery too.

538808,comment,538464,538705,0,0,jrockway,,,"Well, let's think about this in more detail.<p>Let's say you have two types of data, customers and orders.  Customers have many orders, an order belongs to a customer.  This is easy enough with a typical relational database.  You have a customers table and an orders table.  You can join the tables and ask questions like ""how many customers spent more than $300 last year?""<p>Now let's consider the graph/object database equivalent.  You have two classes, Order and Customer.  A Customer has a set of Orders, and the Order has a customer.  (Cycles are fine, this is a <i>graph</i>, not a <i>tree</i>.)  Creating an order works with some method like $customer->new_order_for('some pants').  You store this in the database, and the graph structure is stored and indexed.  (Usually, object databases index on class name, but you can always specify other conditions.  This makes it basically equivalent to the relational database.)  Note that this structure works very well; the in-memory relationship is the same as the in-storage relationship.  You can also write the same query as with the relational database.  Get all customers, find their orders from this year, and sum the totals.  (Instead of writing SQL, you would just write a script here.  You can index things like the order year to speed up the query, as well.  Otherwise, it's O(n), but so is the relational database without an index.  There is no magic after all.)<p>Anyway, there is no lack of flexibility with the graph database.  If you want to query your data, you can.  It's just less convenient, since you have to write a program to do it, instead of letting your database management engine do it.  (This is actually not true in general, AllegroGraph has a querying engine based on prolog.)<p>Back when I did data warehousing, we had to move all our data from the web app servers to a warehousing server in a specialized schema so that some GUI software could manipulate the data.  Even though we used a relational database, we had to convert anyway.  Using an object database would have made the app code simpler, and the warehousing code equally complex.  So I think that would be a gain, not a loss.",1238434782

I think DHH nails that aspect of it.<p>But, how feasible is it to start companies this way? Sure it may have worked well for them and it may even work incredibly well for your business. As hackers though, we know that just because something worked once, twice or 500 times doesn't mean it's the truth or will always work.<p>It's best to be prudent wherever possible and do some research into your market and pricing strategies. I'm not saying go off and create 5 year business plans, I'm just saying it definitely deserves some of your time cycles.",1238434714

We decided to take some French classes together for fun. She was much better able to communicate in general. I can read/write French okay in a formal way. When speaking though I tend to stumble trying to think through rules in my head. In contrast, I took 4 German classes in college.

538776,comment,538464,538464,0,0,mattmcknight,,,"I have run into serious issues with the document based approach. Imagine a domain where you have several different types of documents. You still end up doing joins. In the example the author gives, doing a query to get you all of the unique tags can be slow. Or, if they are dates, trying to get a max(date) can be tricky. The biggest problem though, is document size. For a complex domain, there are big tradeoffs between keeping the entire graph in the document, which is slow to read, or creating a variety of document types, which brings you back to joining.<p>A hybrid approach can give you a little of both. For most of the kind of applications I build, I use relational databases, but I dump a denormalized view of the data into Lucene for searching and such and use a caching layer for most reads.  This way I get some document type performance on many operations, but still have the normalization and simple transactions of a relational model.",1238433399

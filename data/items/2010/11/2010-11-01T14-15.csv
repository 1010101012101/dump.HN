Four if you struggle, but that's it.<p>What people are talking about here is usually the US system, where your PhD path includes Masters classes. You get a Masters along the way (I have mine in a drawer somewhere), but this is incidental along the path to the PhD. It takes 2-3 years to get those classes out the way, then you're all research. The system is the same as you are describing, except that Americans don't tend to split them up in their heads.",1288623567

But there are a fair number of shirkers too, who use this as an excuse to bypass the system.<p>I remember once I was teaching a class, and one of the students sprung this on me: he claimed he had some issues with the tests and the time required was too short (in reality, my tests were always designed such that if you knew the material you could ace them in 20 minutes; if you didn't, you could sit there for an hour. And they were open book, open notes, so no memorization required).<p>So the next test came, and I told him: take as long as you want; I'll be here. The test started at 6pm (it was an evening course). Most of the class left in an hour or so. But he stayed. And I stayed with him. I did my reading, etc. Finally, at 1AM, he gave up and said he was done.<p>The next day, he dropped the course.",1288623434
1856664,comment,1855588,1855588,0,0,JBerlinsky,,,"Coming from a current college student who spent his entire high school career doing this: it is very possible, but it isn't about your skills. It's about who you know.<p>I was very lucky. When I was 14, I ran into a very nice person, Mike, from South Carolina through a PHP forum that we both frequented. He had no idea about my age until I told him a few months after we started working together.<p>Mike had recently been laid off from his full-time IT job, and was getting into the swing of freelance development, much like I was trying to do. He and I explored business models together, shared ideas, and tried to encourage each other's success. When I told him my age (he asked a tax question), he was dumbfounded.<p>Mike's career quickly took off. He found an affiliate marketing company looking for an awesome PHP developer, and is currently making more than enough to live off of. However, he has absolutely no time for other jobs, nontheless to learn new programming languages. As a result, he sent any excess work my way. Since I am young and have an aptitude for this kind of work, I quickly learned whatever tool(s) were necessary for the job. Ruby, Objective-C, Python...I've had clients for tons of programming languages. (Unfortunately, this means I have to use good 'ol Google for a refresher on every one, but it gets the job done.)<p>It's all about who you know when you go into this at a young age. Make good connections now; spend a little bit of time asking questions and making personal connections. The opportunity cost of ""wasting time"" on forums and sending e-mails WILL pay for itself in the long run. Trust me.<p>I assume you're still in high school, and I can only encourage you to stay in school and take AP classes, especially AP Calculus AB/BC and AP Physics C. They'll teach you how to really use the critical thinking skills that you need to succeed in this business. That, and, if you plan to attend college, take AP Chemistry, because general chemistry will kill any free/development time you have in college. Additionally, whatever college you attend probably has a student employment system for their web development; check it out. I know the University of Michigan has a CAEN web team, which I am a part of (well, technically, I'm on the database team, but it's close enough).<p>Best of luck, and feel free to shoot me an e-mail!",1288623341

1856655,comment,1856068,1856140,0,0,Lewisham,,,"I had exam anxiety back when I was 17/18, I pretty much panicked during an exam. We were being tested in national university entrance tests twice a year, with the ability to retake previous ones in later sessions, so the workload and stress was immense by the end. I sat down, read the paper, and was completely unable to string the words I was reading into coherent sentences in my head. I got counseling for stress, and thankfully I was able to take the exams as intended.<p>Exam anxiety is real, but the university already had procedures in place about how to deal with that anxiety. Something is wrong, however, when a student only claims exam anxiety after the fact. You know you're anxious about exams before that point. If you are under stress a single time, you know it then. The student already failed that exam once. If the first time he/she was anxious, it should have been reported then. If not, they had a fair shot at passing that exam.<p>The decision of the dean to change how the exam was to be dealt with is not brilliant, but somewhat OK. It's the upgrading of undergraduate coursework to be doctoral level that should be smelling bad. Messing with the way the exam was to be delivered was simply the smoke from the dodgy fire that was burning underneath.",1288623244

If you already have a set of potential customers then reach out to them and validate whether they need all the features which you are planning to include in the first release? - If the features (the basic set) is less than what you had understood then you need to check how much money you need to get it out to the users.

1856623,comment,1856327,1856327,0,0,tobtoh,,,"Interesting article - but I can't help but feel it's written with a big dose of 20:20 hindsight. Obviously Iridium didn't succeed and if you were doing it again and knew what you know now, you would do things very differently (as the article explains). However, back in 1990 when Iridium started, I think a lot of their decision were not necessary ignorant.<p>In 1990, Iridium probably did have a good solution to a problem in <i>1990</i>. The article mentions that the waterfall model was a bad development model to follow - yes agree - but whilst 'agile' development concepts existed back to the 60s, it really only started becoming more mainstream in mid 1990s (the term 'agile programming' wasn't even used until 2001). So the waterfall model was probably a reasonable model to take back then.<p>""No Business Plan Survives First Contact With A Customer"". Again in the age of release early, release often, this seems to make sense. But when your product is global satellite  coverage, how do you break down your product into something that could be released early/often? I guess you could possibly launch one satellite and see if people would subscribe ... but like the Net, a one-node network would be of very limited value and reach.<p>I agree that the frozen business plan was the critical reason in their failure. Even a regular survey of potential customers would have shown that the price difference was too great for rapidly diminishing benefits.<p>But I don't agree that their initial solution was necessarily bad or that the waterfall model was inherently bad based on 1990s knowledge.",1288622762

If they don't then move on. In 2006 I had a mechanical engineering intern that worked for my company (manufacturing) about 10 hours a week. Once he graduated, he came to me for advice about which jobs he should apply for. At that point I had to choose between paying market rate or losing a guy that had the right talents and experience, who was already up-to-speed with our company processes.<p>I decided to keep him, and doubled his pay to do it. He wasn't twice as good as he was the day before, but we were at the point where company growth demanded a full-time engineering presence and he was the best choice for the job. My other alternatives would have been to spend a lot of time recruiting to find another engineer that would need to be integrated into the company and paid market rate anyway. Perhaps I was underpaying him as an intern, but the workload he was given was not demanding and we were exceptionally flexible with his hours and schedule. We also financially supported his Formula SAE team at the University. He ended up staying for three years and then going back to school to get a PhD.<p>As for your concern about being treated as an intern, don't worry. If they increase your pay they will certainly increase your workload and responsibility. After all, they are now paying for it. With founders leaving the company you could end up one of the most senior people in that division.",1288622676

This leads to valuations that are highly speculative (lot's of risk involved), and funding terms that reflect this.<p>For your case, much of the mystery has been removed.  This also reduces the possibilities of crazy-high valuations, but also gives you a lot more power in the negotiations.<p>My guess would be you might not be the traditional VC big investment big speculation kind of deal, but might look attractive to the lower-end of some of the super-angel sized deals.

We weren't made to blurt out every one of our feelings and observations to the community at large. Instead, we share this piece of information with this person, ask this other person for advice, listen in on these other folks when they talk about X, etc.<p>The is the natural way of being human -- to use a phrase from the movie, it's the social experience.<p>Every technical solution I've seen so far fails to include this contextual nature of communication. It's too much of a pain for folks to pick certain people for certain kinds of talk, and it's all so much a pain in the ass (compared with the old way of physically moving from one group to another)<p>Oddly enough, this was first noticed with TV back in the 1950s. Up until then, conversations were small and cliquish -- the natural order. TV brought in the idea of ""universal"" communicating in a way that radio, plays, or newspapers didn't. Suddenly everybody in the family was in the room when Lucy got pregnant, or when Opie killed the bird with the slingshot.<p>Of course, nobody bothered much complaining back then, because, after all, back in the 1950s what kind of radical information was going to be on TV? And nobody complained (much) when TV got into a lot more controversial issues in the last couple of decades.<p>But now it's not TV -- it's <i>us</i>. It's our lives, our pregnancies, our sorrows, etc.<p>I think people need the contextual nature of communication -- it makes society function. But I don't see any technology solution on the horizon that easily and naturally facilitates this. And yes, if it happens it might just be the next FB killer. But that's a big ""if"".

With extreme fandom, Apple is less concerned about negative feedback.

1856484,comment,1856068,1856268,0,0,roel_v,,,"The standards are being lowered for several reasons. One is that the university gets paid per student they graduate (in most countries in Western Europe that I know about). Another is that politicians feel they need to raise the % of people with degrees in their region/country so they pressure universities to 'accommodate' students as much as possible. Couple this with top positions in universities increasingly being given to non-academics, but rather bureaucrat politicians who get these positions as a reward for years of service to their party and in these roles fill the last few years until their retirement with a cushy, well paid job in which they mostly try to run the university as a company (not being hindered by the fact that they know nothing about actually running a business), and you get every lower academic standards.<p>And then finally, and this may not be the majority of cases but I've seen this happen from very close myself, a part of the problem is the many exchange students who come from developing countries and pay big bucks for their studies. These people have sometimes scraped together everything they and their extended families have to go to the West. If they fail their program, to them it feels like they might as well have been executed on the spot. There's no way they can go back to their countries without a degree. I've seen people on the brink of suicide over the thought of failing exams and having to go back (yes, other ('native') students also get exam anxiety, I'm not dismissing those).<p>So imagine being a professor and having to grade a thesis of a guy that is only a few years younger than you are (these students often come after several years of working and saving), with a wife and a family to support. You know he doesn't live up to the standards of the program. You also know that everybody else knows (academics at universities in the area) so nobody's going to give him a postdoc anyway. So there's no real harm in giving him the degree, at least not until 'the work gets out' and all diplomas devaluated. The student will most likely be going back to where he came from, where he's going to be welcomed as a genius and offered a cushy government or consulting job. All in all, <i>there</i> he's still going to be quite good, at least compared to the other people at the places that would hire him (yes there are very bright Indian, Chinese etc. students who are just as good as any Western student, I'm not disparaging Asians in general - I'm talking about this specific subset of 'academic refugee students').<p>And then consider that if you fail this guy, you know you're basically doing the equivalent of a 'thumbs down' in a Roman amphitheater. That's a tough decision to make. I know, this sort of factors shouldn't come into play, but that's easy to say from behind a desk far far away from this situation. I've seen people seriously struggle with this dilemma, and I've seen choices being made in both directions. It's heart wrenching, and it makes people think several times before accepting a next student who may turn out this way.",1288620664

It related to flikr, which started as some kind of social-type site for young girls (IIRC), then evolved to a gaming site, and then to ""flikr"".  Originally, what we know as flikr was just a simple way for people playing the game to share photos online, then the photo sharing part got way more traction than the game part.<p>The basic lesson at the time was a version of ""release early, release often"", react to user experiences, and if you have money in the bank, keep throwing ideas against the wall until something sticks.<p>So, I don't think there is a whole lot to ""learn"" from similar sites, other than pay attention to your users and try new things.  One thing to keep in mind is that a user base of any appreciable size can be very valuable, so if you do pivot, try to make it fluid enough that you can somehow carry existing users along with you.<p>If your sites are stagnant to the tune of a couple dozen users and monthly traffic that barely registers, IMO you are not pivoting, you are starting over.",1288620640

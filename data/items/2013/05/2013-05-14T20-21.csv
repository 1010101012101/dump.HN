I recommend you look into legal disclosure or e-discovery products.  Not right or wrong, but that's the design assumptions backed by a bunch of lawyers in govt and private sector.<p>The example is incomplete.  In messaging systems, Party A uses Party B to send messages, which may be useful for a court case.  The government may reasonably subpoena Party B to produce Party A's records since they may not want to alert Party A that it is under investigation.<p>If Party B (the service provider) has any feature that makes use of the content of Party A's secrets (read: url-checking, auto-loading thumbnails, indexing for search, some types of routing, etc), then there is little ground for Party B to argue it can't decrypt Party A's records for the subpoena.  Further, Party B may become a co-conspirator if it keeps incomplete records or destroys records too quickly.

5708055,comment,5707619,5707619,10,0,ender7,,,"The author assumes that there is a linear relationship between the amount of money that a creator has at their disposal and the resulting ""production quality"". So, once Jenna Marbles starts making some real bank, out come the camera crews and director and post-production effects and...<p>No. There is no path from Jenna Marbles to the traditional kind of television that the author is used to. They're just...different. Jenna has a specific way that she likes to create things and more money doesn't necessarily change that.<p>To make the kind of TV that the author imagines, you need to drop some money up front. Let's be charitable and say $300,000 for a pilot. Needless to say this is out of reach for almost 100% of the content creators on Youtube, so it's unsurprising that the content that has risen to popularity within Youtube has its roots in methods that cost essentially nothing.<p>Now, there are some interesting exceptions. The Lizzie Bennet Diaries [1] was nowhere near a ""real"" TV show in terms of budget but it had writers, production staff, and hired actors. Vice produces a lot of content that seems like it could fit into a normal TV program [2] -- almost. There are some other interesting shows that are sort of half-way there (well, more like 1/10th of the way there) in that they actually have production crews and do things like post-production (see: Wil Wheaton's Tabletop series [3]). I'm sure there are a ton of other examples.<p>So, the community is sidling up to high-quality content, but it's still unclear exactly how they're going to get there. By my estimation, to create a ""TV-ready"" drama, you'd need at the very least 100k subscribers paying $3/mo. Obviously no one is going to sign up for something if they're never heard of you, so you've got to make some free content that people love, then maybe make the jump via a Kickstarter? Or will true ""channels"" appear that bring the money and the subscribers and that then fund the shows of their choice? This is a really fascinating time for video content -- I'm excited to see how the economics end up playing out.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisuGP2lcPs&feature=c4-overview-vl&list=PL6690D980D8A65D08"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisuGP2lcPs&feature=c4-ov...</a><p>[2] (Warning: NSFW) <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsUH8llvTZo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsUH8llvTZo</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4F80C7D2DC8D9B6C"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4F80C7D2DC8D9B6C</a>",1368564826

5707790,comment,5707019,5707709,35,0,tiredofcareer,,,"You are correct. Go's remote imports are dangerous for long-term project maintenance, but the feature is still useful for quick, throwaway projects.<p>Go badly needs two things:<p>1. A best practice that dictates that you never import from remote repositories in production, long-term code; the feature is fine for one-offs and experimentation, but the article summarizes only <i>one</i> way this style of work can lead you in to a maintenance world of pain. What happens if the repo you're importing from Github is deleted? What do you do for fresh clones? You're going to end up changing the URL <i>anyway</i>. I feel the Go community has kind of glossed over this (and I <i>like</i> Go).<p>2. An equivalent of CPAN or PyPI, which you could then import from in concert with a tool to manage those dependencies, a la:<p><pre><code>    import (
        ""cgan/video/graphics/opengl""
    )
</code></pre>
This model works for CPAN, PyPI, and so on for a reason, and that reason is avoiding several of the dependency/merge hells that remote repos can create. CPAN provides Perl a lot, such as distributed testing in a variety of environments. I personally think such a thing is necessary for long-term maintenance of any software project that utilizes third-party libraries. This is one of Google's oversights in Go, because they have an (obviously) different take on third-party code. Here's a good case:<p><i>Developer A checks out the code clean. Five minutes later, developer B checks out the code clean. In both cases, your ""go get"" bootstrap script fetches two different commits, because in that five minutes, upstream committed a bug. Developer B cannot build or, worse, can build but has several tests fail for unknown reasons or, even worse, the program no longer functions properly. Developer A has none of those problems. In a world with a CPAN-like, developer B can see that he has 0.9.1 and developer A has 0.9.0, developer B can commit ""foo/bar: =0.9.0"" to the project's dependency file, then everybody else doesn't suffer the same fate. In the current world, you're either massaging your local fork to keep the new commit out, or any other troublesome, non-scalable approach to this.</i><p>Building large software projects against a <i>repository</i> never works. You need tested, versioned, cut releases to build against, not master HEAD. It only takes one bad upstream commit to entirely torpedo your build, and you've now completely removed the ability to qualify a new library version against the rest of your code base. Other people are suggesting ""well, maintain your own forks,"" so you're basically moving merge hell from one place to another. I, personally, have better things to do with my time; I've seen (Java) apps with dozens of dependencies before, and keeping dozens of repositories remotely stable for a team of people will rapidly turn into multiple full-time jobs. Do you want to hire two maintenance monkeys[0] to constantly keep your build green by massaging upstream repositories, or do you want to hire two feature developers? Exactly.<p>I've started writing a CPAN-like for Go a couple times but I'm always held back by these threads:<p><a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/golang-nuts/c-s4_uxamf8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/golang-n...</a><p><a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/golang-nuts/-UG-lF_Ey-o"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/golang-n...</a><p>The second one highlighting how difficult Go is to package as a language -- my personal opinion is treat Go just like C and distribute binary libraries in libpackage, then the source in libpackage-src.

The city also had large depots of military supplies, and was a key center for shipping.<p>Looks like a military target to me. They just lacked the foresight not to locate such assets within a civilian population. Sadly, the US does the same thing.<p>Granted, Nagasaki didn't seem to have quite as much in military assets but it is listed it had 9000 soldiers in the city. Sadly that came nowhere near the number of civilians in the city, which included a number of POWs. I wouldn't have picked it as a target.<p>But if you want to demonstrate the destruction caused by a weapon in an effort to force surrender, you don't bomb a soft target. You unfortunately bomb the biggest target you can. During WWII firebombings of entire cities was a common practice. That is common in total war scenarios.<p>Personally, if I were in a position to have some influence on the matter at the time, I would have said the same. I would have nuked any military target of suitable size and hoped that it would suffice to force surrender.<p>But, as I stated elsewhere, this discussion has little to do with my initial complaint of stating the US is the only country to use nuclear weapons in anger with no context to explain the reasoning behind it.",1368562727

5707714,comment,5704860,5705776,49,0,teej,,,">  FooCorp made numerous attempts to improve their business relationship with Bob, despite the risk of annoying Bob. They can justify this by pointing to observable evidence that, if they mail 100 Bobs, statistically Bobs actually do start using the FooSoft, and (anecdotally) their customer support team gets emails and blog posts saying ""Thanks for being so attentive to my needs!!1""<p>I can say from experience that <i>this is exactly this line of thinking that lead to Zynga's viral behavior on Facebook</i>.  It also contributed to it's downfall.<p>The problem with this analysis is that it assumes a zero cost to an unopened email.  It reductively sets this cost as ""the risk of annoying Bob, who won't use us anyway.""  It's not as simple as that.  Misusing any communication channel causes channel fatigue.  This is what happened at Zynga.<p>At Zynga, we had a better understanding of our outbound messaging than nearly every other company in existence.  Messaging, clickthrough, A/B testing, new users/activation/retention/revenue/virality by channel.  We ruthlessly weeded out poor performing messaging with those that performed the best.<p>But when the question came up of ""is this too much?"" it was always cast aside.  The reasoning was the same - on a macro level, users are responding to our messaging positively.  Why would you send less, when sending more has a clear business benefit?<p>The issue is channel fatigue.  Over the years, our CTRs would drop across the board.  Some of these were step-function drops caused by Facebook changes, but it turns out that most of the difference over 5 years was due to Zynga's abuse of the channel.  Every message that they sent to an uninterested user causes that user to trust the channel less.  Every pink cow notification causes them to check that shiny red icon a little bit less.<p>Now, for email, there is no chance that you would send enough email to kill the channel for everyone, it's just too big.  Because of that email works differently.  Every crappy email you send has a cost, and that cost is measured in <i>deliverability</i>.  There is a network of email providers, email distributors, and other companies that deal in ""who's email actually gets sent"".  Every company & domain gets rated on their spaminess, and the worst get cut off from the email ecosystem.<p>If you're abusing the email channel, some of your email will get marked as spam.  Email providers use this data, along with others, to determine if your email should end up in the inbox.  What's also important to note is that individuals can have a huge effect on deliverability.  If I'm an annoyed Bob, there's no reason for me to blog about it or go to social media.  I just have to mark your emails as spam and drop a note to your email distributor to tell them that I think your email practices are abusive.<p>A ""marked as spam"" rate of 0.1% is good.  That means that every ""mark as spam"" event counts for a lot.  It only takes one annoyed Bob to put you on the email spam radar.<p>This is 2013, we have the ability to measure the effect of a single, extra email.  We have the ability to predict our chances of reviving a user who hasn't engaged.  We have the ability to make a statistically significant guess about who could re-engage and who we've lost.  We should be getting <i>smarter</i> about email when we scale up, not <i>spammier</i>.<p>Weebly can do better than this.  And if email is important to the business of Weebly, they should do better.",1368562393

5707682,comment,5701436,5706564,1,0,talmand,,,"I would say their war tactics and public statements leading up to the nuclear bombings would suggest that surrender wasn't in high regard with the people that counted. Especially among a military with a warrior mentality where surrender was considered shameful. These were people, including civilians, that would throw themselves off of cliffs to avoid capture.<p>The US military warned the populace numerous times that their cities would be firebombed. I would assume this was an effort to push towards surrender. Why else warn them? No surrender.<p>Before the first bombing the Japanese government was told to surrender. No surrender.<p>After the first bombing, a demand to surrender was made. No surrender.<p>The second bombing and another demand to surrender. Around five days later the Emperor finally told the people of Japan that surrender was necessary. Know why it was almost a week later, even though they were told more were coming? Because the Emperor wanted to stay Emperor.<p>That's the part that people don't seem to understand. The nuclear bombings were not intended to convince the Japanese populace to surrender, because many might have on their own without the bombings. Even many in the military might have been willing to surrender. It is said that Yamamoto despaired attacking America from the beginning. But more than likely, none of them would have surrendered until the Emperor told them to do so. In the end, the nuclear bombs were to convince the Emperor to surrender, not the people. Even facing this threat of total destruction he still held out for his own selfish reasons, and even then claimed he was doing it to save mankind. The simple fact this statement of saving mankind came from a military leader who's policy seemed to be maim, torture, and kill anyone that wasn't Japanese is one of the most brazen attempts at spin that's ever been tried.<p>Never mind the fact that the Soviets were ready and willing to invade. You can ask the Germans how that went for them.<p>Now, I've heard of this thought that there are examples of the Japanese willing to come to a peace agreement. But suing for peace is a different matter than total surrender. Peace agreements with the aggressor often have a problem of leading to future conflicts when the peace agreement no longer holds true. Ask the Koreans how they feel about their ""peace agreement"" with the never-ending threat of war, as comical as it may seem.<p>Think of the times; America had suffered huge losses in men and wealth to fight two massive fronts in a war they didn't start. Don't forget the millions, I'll say it again, MILLIONS, of people that died at the hands of the Germans and Japanese. The war in Europe was mostly over and the only reason for that is because Hitler was dead, many Germans fought to the bitter end even though it was obvious they were going to lose. No one wanted a repeat of the ending days of the European theater in Japan. The people around the world wanted that crap to end as soon as possible. You have to understand that the Allies at this point had built up such hatred for the Japanese that many would not have a problem whatsoever invading and killing every man, woman, and child of that small island nation. It would have cost dearly to do so, but it would have been done. The likely outcome is that the Japanese people would have become the human equivalent of an endangered species.<p>So all this talk of they could have done this, they could have done that, or whatever else all has the benefit of seriously strong hindsight.<p>I agree, nuclear weapons were not needed to end the war, but considering the other options, it was probably the best choice at the time.",1368562085

have access to the e-mail address or SMS number that the receipt is
sent to.  That Square has access and will offer the customer the
choice of using a previously used receipt destination, could be seen
as a great convenience for repeat customers, or a privacy issue -
you decide.  For details, see:<p><a href=""https://squareup.com/legal/privacy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://squareup.com/legal/privacy</a><p><a href=""https://squareup.com/legal/seller-agreement"" rel=""nofollow"">https://squareup.com/legal/seller-agreement</a><p>The Stand appears to be an entry in the niche of minimal POS
(Point-of-Sale) setups, perhaps as an answer to an upgrade desire: 
""I like Square, but I need something more like a cash register.""<p>It does seem to solve a security issue by tethering the iPad to the
counter, which anyone whose phone has been stolen can readily appreciate.<p>I am surprised that the signature process is not done by tilting the
device toward the customer and letting the screen display rotate. 
Perhaps Square is aiming more toward upscale retailers with great
expanses of customer-facing counter space (who would also be more
likely to pay the 2.75% transaction fee.)  Perhaps the choice of white hardware is based on the same approach.",1368561730

The higher the intensity, the better you must be at doing the exercise properly. Since you seem to have started working out using high intensity, I assume you did not know how to properly do it. High Intensity is not recommended to beginners. It is a special form of workout. This is why they mention this in the article:<p>""caution should be taken when prescribing this protocol to individuals who are overweight/obese, detrained, previously injured, or elderly or for individuals with comorbidities. For individuals with hypertension or heart disease, the isometric exercises (wall sit, plank, and side plank) are not recommended.""<p>Obviously, for beginners, something with less intensity, and a higher tolerance for mistake will have better results. While you learn how to properly do exercise, and build a core foundation, that will later allow you to move to high intensity. The reason you would want to later move to high intensity, is for either lack of time, in which case, you will need the shortest workout with the highest fitness accomplishments. Or for improved oxygen flow levels and decreased body fat, which high intensity is often better at than other types of workout, no matter how much of it.<p>The workout described in this article, is one routine, you should not be doing it ad vitam eternam, it serves as an example, and you already need to be in a certain fitness level to perform it properly.",1368561708

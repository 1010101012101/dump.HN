Much easier to figure out when someone's started a conversation.<p>I also cleaned up the chain display page.  Now when you look at a chain page, a chain link only shows up if it has a post with more than 10 letters.  That way, you can always read interesting content from other people without seeing blank chain links.<p>Removed the not-safe-for-work chain from the front page. ;)<p>I've accentuated some little things.  What do you all think about the redesign?",1188013238

No.<p>Well, you can bullshit only so much in FB before your friends call you on it. And who knows you better than your friends?! So I'd be more worried about being fed bullshit during an interview than looking at a social site.<p>",1188012870

46499,comment,45698,46471,0,0,staunch,,,"AdSense was at least partially an acquisition. Video became YouTube. Froogle is largely a failure. Considering how many programmers Google has your argument that they're good at producing stuff in-house is pretty weak. They're great at scaling and running stuff, but so far they don't seem to be very much better at creating new great things than any big company is.

I think you really have to watch/read lots of Sagan or do some deep thinking to really fathom how empty it is.

It's that they can recognize and attract other great hackers to work for them, and that they're respected enough that those other hackers will give their best effort and not cynically slack off.  You think that Jobs could have attracted Burrell Smith and Bud Tribble and Andy Hertzfeld alone if they weren't working with Woz?  Or that he could've hired John Lasseter at Pixar without Ed Catmull and Alvy Ray?",1188011192

6258789,comment,6254482,6254482,3,0,alexepstein,,,"Im the author of the Forbes piece. I elaborated on the issues in a recent post I submitted to the Tesla forum in response to many of the criticisms raised here. You can read it here or pasted below. <a href=""http://industrialprogress.com/2013/08/22/the-tesla-debate/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://industrialprogress.com/2013/08/22/the-tesla-debate/</a><p>The fundamental question being argued on both sides is, as I see it, whether the government should severely restrict fossil fuel useand, as part of that policy, promote electric cars as an alternative.<p>In my view, because cheap, plentiful, reliable energy is so important to technological and human progress, and because fossil fuel technology is essential to providing that caliber of energy for a long time to come, governments should absolutely not be restricting fossil fuel use. (For those interested in seeing how this case stacks up in an open debate, see my recent Stanford debate with Sierra Club Senior Director Bruce Nilles.) Making this case requires addressing concerns about climate head-on, which I did.<p>Perhaps the most neglected benefit of fossil fuel energy is in making us safer from the climate. Our cultural discussion on climate change fixates on whether or not fossil fuels impact the climate. Of course they doeverything doesbut the question that matters is whether it is becoming safer or more dangerous. Here, the data is unambiguousin the last 80 years, as fossil fuels have increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere from .03% to all of .04%, we have become 50 times less likely to die because of climate-related causes. Give thanks to the proliferation of climate-protection technology (climate control, sturdy homes, weather satellites, drought-relief convoys, modern agriculture), which are made possible by fossil fuels.<p>Most of the posts on this forum assume that climate change is a basis for government action, but none even attempted to address my case about the actual effects of CO2 emissions on climate safety. The underlying data here place an enormous burden of proof on anyone claiming future catastrophe. And that burden cannot be met as the catastrophic climate models are demonstrable failures at predicting climate. (As I will argue later, even if there was a big problem, advocating solar as the solution would not be logical.)<p>Other posts on the forum assume that the finite nature of fossil fuels implies some sort of necessary government support of electric cars. But basic economics tells us that the price of the finite commodities involved in every mode of transport will signal if and when a change is necessary. (Note: price is more important than energy efficiency. Energy efficiency is just one form of resource efficiency, and often not the most important. If youre admirer of solar, note that an excellent solar panel is 20% efficientshould that disqualify it?)\nGiven that electric cars are currently a tiny, luxury, resource-intensive niche of the transportation market, it is odd to assume that all the resources involved will smoothly and economically scale globally. We have no idea, just as we have no idea whether there will be a revolution in coal-to-liquids or gas-to-liquids will mean superior hydrocarbon fuels for hundreds of years to come. Or even whether synthesizing methanol from biomass and burning it using standard internal combustion engines will be more efficient than powering cars with energy-intensive batteries. If were free to choose along the way, we dont have to know in advance.<p>Although I do not believe that CO2 emissions are a problem, even if it was the public approach of Elon Musk, Tesla, and much of Teslas following would be counterproductivebecause any constructive approach requires taking on the leading opponents of cheap, plentiful, reliable, non-carbon energy: the environmentalist movement.<p>I am an adamant supporter of nuclear power and hydroelectric power, as are some of you; the environmentalist movement is the leading opponent of both forms of powerthe Sierra Club being a particularly egregious example. These organizations are the ones who made nuclear power uneconomic; without them, there is a strong case nuclear would have won out worldwide on the free market. (For more on this issue, see my pro-nuclear Facebook page, I Love Nuclear, as well as Petr Beckmanns classic The Health Hazards of NOT Going Nuclear.<p>Elon Musk should use his public position to every anti-nuclear group. Instead, he endorses their empty promise that solar can power our civilization. Thats why in my article I focused on solarthats what Tesla assures us will replace the fossil fuels it opposes (but uses).<p>To be solution-oriented means to advocate the best optionsand that could also include geo-engineering, also opposed by environmentalistsnot just the politically correct ones.\nTo be solution-oriented in this context also means to look for global solutions that would actually work. In my article I cited the fact that globally solar and wind produce less than 1% of the worlds electricityand that must be backed up by a reliable source, usually fossil fuels. Several posts on this forum took me to task because their Teslas run on a higher percentage of solar and wind. No one addressed the point about requiring backupusually 100% solar means a reliable source of energy is providing 100% backup (which doesnt scale). And more broadly, no one acknowledged that solar/wind is a luxury good. Its very expensive and it scales very, very poorly. If were talking 80% global CO2 reductions, the fact that your particular Tesla uses X% solar is completely irrelevant because few can afford it and the solution wouldnt scale if more could.<p>If you believe that catastrophic global warming is the problem of our age, then the solution is to take a hard line against the environmentalist movement and look for global solutions on the scale of the problem. It is not to, forgive me, be self-righteous about your Tesla.<p>I bring up the self-righteous point because I very much admire the Tesla, and I think it deserves to be supported in a spirit of pure enthusiasm for technology and humanitynot defensiveness and partisanship.<p>When I write an article trying to convey that the Tesla S is testament to the unacknowledged virtues of fossil fuel energy, and the response I get in the Tesla forum is to be labeled a hater, that is partisan.<p>It is also partisan to dismiss me because I support fossil fuels. A few people wrote me off for wearing an I Love Fossil Fuels shirt to a Tesla store, or period. Well, I do love fossil fuels and the fossil fuel industry and I came to that love honestly, for reasons that I hope are clear. (For more reasons, read my book.) I believe it was an incredibly appropriate shirt to wear to the Tesla store. Incidentally, it was not premeditatedI just happened to be wearing it at the Fashion Island mall, but Im glad I did.<p>I hope that clarifies where Im coming from. If youre interested in learning more about how to think about environmental issues from a consistently humanist, technological perspective, I hope youll take a look at my book and my essay The Industrial Manifesto.

And the only place to get those experts is from the industry.<p>This is a very key point.<p>One of the ways that the Navy&#x27;s nuclear management agency (NR) has tried to avoid the problem of regulatory capture is that they train their own experts in addition to pulling experienced personnel from the nuclear-powered fleet.<p>Those who have never been underway but still understand nuclear power and administration are typically thought of as a bunch of pompous no-fun assholes... but that&#x27;s their <i>job</i> and they do it well. They have little to no ability to be empathic with ship&#x27;s crew as they&#x27;ve not been underway and dead tired and all that... and so it&#x27;s that much easier to demand that the <i>right thing</i> is done instead of the easy thing.<p>It&#x27;s not enough just to train your own experts though.

The haziness of procedures, lack of basic rights, intimidation, no accountability of state officials -- we&#x27;ve seen all that until 1989.

I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s so much to do with a &quot;full blown OS&quot; versus just having a lot of hardware and not knowing what to do with it. The reverse is also terrible, when they spin up a new hypervisor-driven VM for every single puny network service.<p>The simplified model you&#x27;re talking about is cloud computing. It doesn&#x27;t matter if your hosts are virtual or not, the point is having an abstraction layer that manages resources for you so the client application doesn&#x27;t have to care.<p>Virt comes into play when you&#x27;re tailoring your servers to your application. Example: Are you really i/o bound? A thousand 1Us with 4 disks each will deliver more iops than a couple dozen beefy VM host machines, and possibly [read: probably] cheaper than a high-performance SAN. Or, do your services just need segregated resources? LXC (or openvz) will provide that regardless of your hardware, so that may be a good fit too.<p>The adage &#x27;the right tool for the job&#x27; refers not to the most expensive tool, or newest, or the most flexible, or the most anything. It&#x27;s just the tool that fits right. Could you use a crescent wrench to remove lug nuts from your car? Probably. But it&#x27;s not the right tool.",1377192992

Granted, I&#x27;ve done a handful of terrible interviews (either because of the questions or because the interviewers weren&#x27;t prepared), but I think <i>good</i> tech interviews are very productive. I&#x27;ve been on both sides of the table: from the interviewee&#x27;s side, a good interview allows you to show off your strengths and show the team how you work; from the employer&#x27;s side, it&#x27;s important to get inside the candidate&#x27;s head and see exactly how they work and how the solve problems.<p>Now, a good interview isn&#x27;t one where you ask question about the technical details of a language or a framework or how HTTP works or anything like that. Sure, good technical knowledge is necessary for most positions, especially senior ones, but information is really easy to pick up as you go, whereas real talent is not. Good interviews ask more broad, open-ended questions. &quot;If you wanted to build X, how would you build it?&quot; &quot;If your app was really slow, where would you look to fix it?&quot; &quot;What do you think about framework/language/tool X in relation to tool Y?&quot; Etc, etc. These kinds of questions let you really get into the candidate&#x27;s head and figure out if he&#x27;s a good fit, while still allowing him room to go in a different direction and play to his own strengths.",1377192416

Keep in mind this is not the final disposition of the CFAA claims.  This is an order on a pre-trial motion.  It just tells us the Court intends to consider those claims along with the others _if_ the case proceeds to trial.  (There is always the possibility the case may not get there.)<p>The Court vociferously rips through 3Taps&#x27; arguments for dismissing the CFAA claims.<p>Anyone who is net savvy who has ever encountered the CFAA has no doubt pondered the problems in its vague, non-technical language and then in its (to no one&#x27;s surprise) capricious application.   The 3Taps case stands to be yet another example of the CFAA&#x27;s flaws on parade.<p>Do the Courts see gross deficiencies in the CFAA&#x27;s language and how this can affect the CFAA&#x27;s application?  If yes, would they rather deal with them now or just leave them for another day?<p>Consider what this Court says when faced with the question of what constitutes &quot;without authorization&quot; under the CFAA.  Note this is when the computer in question is otherwise open to the public and lacks any access controls such as password protection or approved originating IP addresses:<p>&quot;To be sure, later cases may confront difficult questions concerning the precise contours of an effective &#x27;revocation&#x27; of authorization to access a generally public website.  This Court cannot and does not wade into that thicket, except to say that under the facts here, which include the use of a technological barrier to ban all access, 3Taps&#x27; deliberate decision to bypass that barrier and continue accessing the website constituted access &#x27;without authorization&#x27; under the CFAA.&quot;<p>A &quot;thicket&quot; indeed.  And we shall let it grow.  I often see the word thicket used to describe the problems with patents.  And we all see how those problems have played out so far.<p>Since access authorization and its revocation are apparently difficult standards to pin down in the computer context, just for fun, if you&#x27;ll join me for a small thought experiment, I invite you to take a different angle and look at the CFAA in a &quot;new&quot; light.<p>The second sentence of the Order defines the applicability of the CFAA in no uncertain terms:  &quot;The CFAA imposes civil and criminal liability on &#x27;whoever... intentionally accesses a computer without authorization... and thereby obtains... information from any protected computer. 18 USC S.1030(a)(2)(c).&quot;<p>This is quite broad in scope.  Anyone with an ounce of computer network savvy can see that.<p>It&#x27;s also very general in terms of who it protects.  There&#x27;s no mention of who the presumed victim might be.<p>What if the protected party is an individual consumer?  Might the CFAA protect individual persons, and not just entities like governments and companies?<p>Let&#x27;s assume the consumer has a computer.  Let&#x27;s further assume the computer stores information.  Sound plausible so far?  Let&#x27;s further assume the consumer tries to protect the information on the computer.  Still with me?  OK, now let&#x27;s assume that information has value to some third party.  I don&#x27;t want to limit the reaches of this thought experiment by giving examples (with which you might find fault), but in the case you just cannot fathom a scenario where a person wants to protect information stored on her computer: assume that some companies want access to her email address book or web browsing history and she would rather keep that information private.  Finally, let&#x27;s assume that the consumer wants to revoke the authorization of certain of these third parties to access the information, but the determined engineers employed by these third parties opt to bypass the barriers that the consumer puts up and obtain the information, perhaps by stealth.[1]<p>Hopefully, if I&#x27;ve done a decent job, you can see the CFAA could, at least in theory, under this Court&#x27;s very general statement of the law, be used by an individual to protect her information stored on her computer from companies who proceed to access it without her authorization, in addition to, as in the 3Taps case, protecting information of a company like Craigslist from competitors who wish to access CL&#x27;s information without CL&#x27;s authorization.[2][3]  If not, pay no mind and resume your usual train of thought.  Who wants to bet this case gets settled out of court?<p>1. You might ask how the consumer would go about revoking authorization.  Does she need to send cease and desist letters?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  I&#x27;d argue whatever she does it needs to be clear.<p>2. CL&#x27;s protected information is of course information submitted by individual users.  And see 3.<p>3. The weakness of CL&#x27;s case, from a copyright infringement perspective, is, according to some commentators, that the information CL is seeking to protect is not created by CL but by users, who may or may not have transferred enforcement rights to CL.  Here is another issue to consider: Did the drafters of the CFAA care whether the complainant has any rights to the protected information?",1377192153

It&#x27;s lonely for anyone who values social connection. Unless you work on your own, the workplace is a bad environment for sleep.<p>There are also potential health concerns for certain polyphasic sleep schedules. Most polyphasic sleepers don&#x27;t sleep a full ~8.5 hours in a day. Your body uses sleep to refresh your body and keep the body (particularly the circulatory system) running strong. On my schedule, I started by sleeping about 5 hours. I was monitoring my blood pressure, and while it remained within a healthy range (I was in my mid twenties) the variance was much greater than it was on 8.5 hours. When I went to sleep late at night, my BP was quite low.<p>The long-term health effects aren&#x27;t well known - there aren&#x27;t many people to study, and a clinical trial would be all but impossible (people would likely not adhere to it). We can make some guesses, though. For one thing, you&#x27;re altering the way melatonin and cortisol work in your system. Messing with your body&#x27;s chemical and hormonal balance usually doesn&#x27;t turn out well for health.<p>We have one group to compare with: people who work night shifts. Studies have shown they&#x27;re at increased risks for <i>heart problems, ulcers, obesity, depression, some cancer, other gastrointestinal diseases</i>, and possibly more. (Just Google it or use Scholar: <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=night+shift+workers+health"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=night+shift+worker...</a>) I certainly experienced depression.<p>There are other things that are just annoying. As someone else stated, coffee is a bad idea, and so is alcohol, and I enjoy both. Most people will have to decide between holding to a schedule or attending others&#x27; events. You&#x27;ll probably either eat worse at night or have to cook more. Nothing is open when you&#x27;re awake. The list goes on.<p>I don&#x27;t recommend it, but if you DO think you want to try it, still, here are some suggestions:<p>-You must have a completely dark room to sleep in during the daytime.<p>-Avoid coffee and alcohol. In fact, cut coffee and alcohol out before you change your sleep schedule. Doing both (especially if you rely on coffee) will be quite a shock.<p>-To adhere to the schedule, you&#x27;ll have to think of what you&#x27;re going to do when no one you know is awake. You need to schedule things.<p>-Don&#x27;t forget to schedule social things. I tried to be wake up before 7 PM when many social things seem to start.",1377192055

If you have state that has to be saved from I/O operation to I/O operation then you have to store that somewhere. In Go you would store it in the goroutine stack; note that allocating a goroutine stack requires an allocation. In Node you would store it in the callback environment, also requiring an allocation. In theory an optimizing JavaScript engine could reuse the same captured variable environment across multiple closures if it&#x27;s the same, resulting in the same asymptotic performance as Go.",1377191401

The assumption was that, if you didn&#x27;t want it broadcast on the nightly news, you didn&#x27;t say it on the internet.  It didn&#x27;t have anything to do with the NSA.  The assumption was just that the sysadmin would read your e-mails and monitor your chats if she was bored.  It came down to the whole &quot;my hard drive is my property and I have the right to read any e-mails stored on my property&quot;.  However, it&#x27;s clear that societal mores have changed, so I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s any more unreasonable to expect privacy in front of a cop.<p>For instance, maybe I don&#x27;t want the government to have video of me at a urinal.  Of course, cops are human, so they&#x27;re going to have to use the bathroom.  When the cop enters the bathroom and stands waits in line for a toilet, did the government get a right to record my urination?  Heck, can I record other people at the urinal, or are those surveillance rights reserved for just the government?  Can stores setup bathroom cameras?  Okay, I&#x27;m getting unreasonably sarcastic here, but I had thought the obvious solution would be to have the cops turn off their camera when they go to the bathroom. However, the public opinion seems clear that we don&#x27;t want the cops to have an off switch, so I&#x27;m a little confused no about who gets to record me in the bathroom.",1377191296

An entrepreneur in my not-so-humble opinion is someone who is on the corner selling bottles of water. An entrepreneur is the guy who came up to me in the Home Depot parking lot yesterday and offered to fix some scratches and dents on my car for $15 but hustled me to $40. An entrepreneur is someone who has taken risks, stood in the face of being homeless, had a rough childhood, and has become shaped into an entrepreneur by the influencing forces in his or her life.<p>An entrepreneur is NOT a 23 year old who decides he has an idea and wants to see how it works out. An entrepreneur is NOT someone who spends all day attending networking events and attending events like Stanford eBootcamp or living off VC money.<p>Going to med school doesn&#x27;t immediately make you a doctor.

6258356,comment,6256311,6257768,12,0,zeidrich,,,"I have been really focusing on my motivation and willpower lately.  I used to have a very similar scenario to what you describe.<p>What works for me is this:\n1) Recognize that my willpower is limited, like a muscle it can be exhausted and needs rest.\n2) Recognize that when I&#x27;m listless that it&#x27;s not a moral failing, it&#x27;s essentially my willpower being exhausted.\n3) Never feel guilty for that feeling of listlessness, instead use it as an opportunity to rest.\n4) Pay attention to what types of rest work most effectively.\n5) Never try to override this rest unless it&#x27;s seriously important. (And not everything can be seriously important).\n6) Recognize that you don&#x27;t need to feel driven to get things done.  You need to do things to get things done.<p>When I exhaust my will, I suck at maintaining priorities. I drive on feelings, and unless I can work myself up into a stress-filled frenzy, I&#x27;m going to do the things that I&#x27;m not supposed to be doing.  However, if I do work myself into a stress-frenzy, I&#x27;m going to be working erratically and inefficiently and generally be a giant pain to be around.  A lot of people live in this state to cope with these problems. Drugs, caffeine, distractions, over-exaggeration all help you maintain it.<p>When I&#x27;m working comfortably with motivation to spare, I can choose a task and do it.  I can make a plan and stick to it. I&#x27;m very efficient relatively speaking. The most noticeable thing though is I&#x27;m a lot less emotional about the things I&#x27;m doing.  I&#x27;m not angry or irritated, but I&#x27;m also not really excited either.  That&#x27;s not to say I&#x27;m not passionate or really interested, but I&#x27;m calm.  The sort of emotional outbursts are stressful, and just being under stress drains my will.<p>The biggest difference I&#x27;ve noticed though is that when I&#x27;m able to work myself down into that calm motivated state, I&#x27;m less affected by trepidation and apprehension.  I don&#x27;t feel guilty about the things that I have been putting off; part of that is because I&#x27;ve committed to not feel guilty, but a large part is that I&#x27;ve got some control over my feelings.  When I&#x27;m stressed and my will is exhausted, I hate myself for the things I haven&#x27;t done.  When I&#x27;m motivated I will pick something that has been cast aside for 3 weeks and just do what needs to be done, not feeling guilty or shameful, just continuing.<p>The more I can keep myself in the second state, the easier it is.  I don&#x27;t get as stressed, so I&#x27;m less likely to fall back into the first state.  So ultimately, the real challenge is how to get back to the calm motivated state when you&#x27;re in the stress-frenzy state.<p>The simple thinking is that &quot;I want to get stuff done&quot; so you push yourself to work harder and frustrate yourself that you are failing.  But that generates more stress and makes it harder.  The less intuitive path is to let yourself rest, and not let yourself get frustrated and stressed about it.  Stop procrastinating and start resting.  The difference between procrastinating and resting is really just that in the former you&#x27;re worrying yourself over the things you&#x27;re not doing.<p>I&#x27;ve always had up and down moments.  In my down moments I can be useless.  So instead of trying to never have down moments, I try to make the most of them instead of struggling with them, and never spend my up moments regretting them.  Over the long term this has lead to my down moments being not as bad, not as long, and less frequent.",1377190944

The police and prosecutors will be more than happy to show video evidence in court when it justifies police actions -- it is pretty hard to raise doubts about the claim that a suspect charged at the police with a knife when the police have a video of it happening.  When the police show up in court and claim to have forgotten to turn their cameras on, the defense gets a big boost -- &quot;<i>Convenient</i> that you forgot to turn the camera on just before beating my client into a coma, yet you did not fail to turn it on in your previous 30 arrests.&quot;",1377190934

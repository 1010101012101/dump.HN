7387536,comment,7382390,7385225,2,0,fallous,,,"Oh yes, we have globals on an, erm, &quot;global&quot; basis.  As a bonus, this codebase was originally written to be entirely flat-file driven and later database bolt-ons for large portions were merely backups for those files.  Of course, being dependent on flat files the code helpfully avoided any use of OS-provided locking and instead implemented a lockfile system that checked for existence of lockfile, if not exists then wrote that file and proceeded to modify the data file (and never appended, just rewrote).  If the lockfile existed, it checked for existence 10,000 times and if the file was still there, it deleted it and then proceeded.  Because counting to 10K takes a long time on a computer.  And because nothing could actually create a lock between the time the code checked for existence vs creating its own.  And because anything any other script is doing that takes more than counting from 1 to 10k is worth writing, so just overwrite.  And that slow script would never overwrite your write. <i>sigh</i><p>The most amusing part of that last bit was presenting concurrency tests that showed any concurrency > 1 insured corruption (because the C-level who chose the original contractor/employee refused to believe the actual logical argument of its faults) and still having to deal with arguments about how &quot;it hasn&#x27;t happened yet!&quot;  &quot;Your house has never burnt down, yet you own insurance.  And as an aside, I will note that it has happened on several occasions.  You&#x27;ve just never had to actually solve it and your prior monkey kept you in the dark about it.&quot;",1394650723

You can&#x27;t rewrite history when history is replicated along several repos.<p>Of course you can. Your local repo and the remote servers you have access to are malleable and can manipulated however you&#x27;d like. I happily force push when the situation calls for it.<p>However, it <i>does</i> place a burden on everyone else who fetches/pulls from that repo and so one need to take that into consideration. For major screwups (like the 50gb file accidental checkin from the article), it&#x27;s very, very good that this can happen.<p>For one of my projects I&#x27;m using git-multimail[1] on our &quot;master&quot; repo and it handles force pushes brilliantly (sends out emails with a list of commits removed/added). This is a great way to communicate with the rest of the team when you have a rewrite-after-push culture.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/mhagger/git-multimail"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mhagger/git-multimail</a>",1394650717

Every day?<p>This is a genuine question, please bear with me. I follow several high-traffic mailing lists, and I use e-mail as my primary means of Internet communication, because I started using it back when ICQ wasn&#x27;t all the rage yet. But they&#x27;re all tidied up and filtered. Checking my e-mail in the morning takes, what, five minutes, plus 10-15 minutes or so of reading messages from the mailing lists that I actively read because they&#x27;re really important for my work. Every couple of days or so I spend maybe another thirty minutes skimming the other mailing lists, but <i>an hour</i> of e-mail is pretty much something that I&#x27;ve never done. Do various service-related e-mails pile up, like Facebook&#x27;s neverending stream of notifications? If so, why is this news-worthy?<p>I regularly hear about it, and regularly hear that Gmail is particularly adept at dealing with this. I don&#x27;t use Gmail; I have an old account there, opened when it was still invitation-based because every techie had to have one of course, but I&#x27;m not really sure about what else it can do other than, you know, filter messages. Are there any additional capabilities here?<p>And, Interwebs, please don&#x27;t take this the wrong way -- I&#x27;m not trying to put up the smug l33t h4x0r attitude who doesn&#x27;t understand how kids nowadays misuse computers, I&#x27;m really trying to understand how people use e-mail nowadays.",1394650193

Eventually some C-level management changes along with a couple of years of my insistence that delusions to the contrary we did not in fact have any in-house design talent, the company decided to finally address the woeful usability of their product and hired a usability/design firm to create a new front-end.  Given that most of the original code entwined presentation, models, views, and sewage plumbing completely this was the opportunity to re-architect with the caveat that we wanted to limit the scope of that effort to purely customer-facing areas, because the homebrewed in-house &quot;CRM&quot; was at least as craptastic as the customer side of things but was a much larger codebase and dealing with a ground-up change was a recipe for disaster.<p>So in effect we have two systems running in parallel, with rational database design and separation of concerns on the customer side along with duplication of data into the older database to minimize impact on the internal stuff.

7387380,comment,7385955,7387153,2,0,kefka,,,"> Yes, but bandwidth = speed, so all else equal, a wider allowed bandwidth produces greater speed.<p>That&#x27;s not quite true. It&#x27;s Bandwidth + encoding = speed . And there&#x27;s tons of digital encoding schemes: ASK APSK CPM FSK MFSK MSK OOK PPM PSK QAM SC-FDE TCM for starters. And those would allow you to pick up and decode using any old computer running a HDTV usb capture card that can go into raw mode.<p>> Maybe in a perfect world without anyone else competing for the frequencies.<p>Nobody would bat an eye if I was to start doing UAV control over 145.50-145.80 with a 20KHz bandwidth . I&#x27;d just hop on the local repeater and announce that is what I was doing, and have a radio listening in priority mode to it. If I heard of any anomalies, I&#x27;d shut it down and investigate what&#x27;s going on.<p>And I have no LoS issues and 2M usually has a nice noise floor. Obviously that doesn&#x27;t quite apply at night, but just stay vigilant in not harming others.<p>> Note about radio control that, over decades of time, the command & control frequencies have been going up. There&#x27;s a good reason -- the original 27 MHz scheme was unworkable for multiple reasons, but one of them was limited bandwidth.<p>Tubes and early silicon made access to the lower frequencies tenable. Of course the lower frequencies will fill up first. So, it does make great sense, for higher bandwidth using services, to use high frequencies. That&#x27;s why I said the video could be on the 2.4 GHz spectrum, whereas the command can be on 144MHz.<p>I&#x27;d also consider going lower, making AM more usable. For command frequencies, NOT having capture* is a great deal. That&#x27;s why control towers mainly use AM and digital modes/CSMA variant.<p>*Capture is an FM phenomenon, where the strongest FM signal that hits a receiver is the only signal the receiver can hear. The receiver is literally captured to that station. AM does not have that, and what you hear is the jumble of every station in range. Just tune at night on AM and you can hear this.",1394649312

And the relationship between votes and helpfulness isn&#x27;t strongly correlated.<p>In short, helpfulfulness isn&#x27;t quantifiable. So it all comes down to why you post.<p>One more thing. Having posted in this and other fora for more than twenty years, I can report that some people only vote, and others only read for content and never vote, and the two groups are only loosely associated. I&#x27;ve noticed that some posts get wildly upvoted or downvoted but without many comments, other get lots of comments with few votes.

The only problem with &quot;pure&quot; Agile is that it doesn&#x27;t scale past 10 or so developers. If you&#x27;re developing a sufficiently complex product, you need process. You need specs that can be distributed to other teams so they can build around the planned changes your team is making to its module.<p>This can be done in a pseudo-Agile way and coupled with a continuous integration process, which is what most companies call &quot;Agile&quot;. Releases get cut every few sprints, so the product guys are happy. Developers hate it because all process that interferes with coding is bad, but it&#x27;s still better than a traditional 6 month waterfall cycle.<p>It&#x27;s not really Agile if you&#x27;re being a purist, but it&#x27;s a good compromise that keeps the business happy with the visibility they get while still releasing code on a relatively short cycle. There will always be process in any sufficiently large organization, since we all have different opinions on how to do things but we need to be on the same page.",1394648809

Specifically property taxes, business license taxes, local sales taxes, and charges for local services. None of the taxes that you mentioned Google paying would directly fund the maintenance of Dolores Street.<p>Google does pay some of these local taxes, because they have a small office in San Francisco.

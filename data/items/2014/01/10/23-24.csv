If you happen to care about users&#x27; welfare as well as about your &quot;positive ROI&quot; -- in other words, if you see them as people rather than as tools to be manipulated in a way that brings you the most benefit -- then their annoyance and/or confusion is a reason not to use the technique. (It might be outweighed by that &quot;positive ROI&quot;, but it&#x27;s a reason.)<p>2. Even if you do see your users only as tools for increasing your profits or mindshare or whatever, annoying and/or confusing them may have bad long-term consequences. They may stay on your site longer right now, as you intend -- but they may also be that bit more likely to abandon you for some other site that doesn&#x27;t annoy or confuse them so much.

Another thought -- although I don&#x27;t generally touch 3d rendering, or know enough to know if it&#x27;s possible off the top of my head -- is something like cross-process pbuffers: you render into one, and composite the result to the screen from another process.

Fedora is great for the desktop, but I really like &quot;Enterprise Linux&quot; on the server side.  I basically abandoned RedHat after the RHEL/Fedora split.  Went to Gentoo (to unstable at the time) for a bit, Ubuntu, then CentOS during the late 4.x releases.  I will pretty much stick with CentOS from here on out, why?  Well enterprise customers who what support can get it, people who don&#x27;t can easily use it, and those that don&#x27;t want to pay now but know they will need to later will have an easy path forward.  And its nice to have a major release that will remain stable and patched for a 7 year haul.  Some folks seem to be concerned like this is a bad thing, RedHat has been a model citizen for open source.  The amount of work they do in backporting fixes for people who need to remain on a version for whatever reason is huge.  On top of the fact that they make most (all?) of their own software freely available as well.  There is really no advantage for them to do anything to CentOS other than keep it doing what its doing, but faster.",1389397790

Where things start to get crazy is that 4K is now the standard for movie projection in commercial theatres and creative professionals of all stripe are clamoring to produce content that takes advantage not only of the pixels but all the qualitative properties that photographers, illustrators, animators need. For me as a photographer, having a 4K camera is a wonderful thought in terms of resolution but if the display can&#x27;t integrate into my workflow to match my printer then it is not so useful. It is this referenceability issue that makes it possible for Sony to sell 10,000 dollar reference monitors for television production.

Housing density is low in most places, so &quot;working-class&quot; people get pushed out of &quot;nice&quot; areas, so they need to commute.  Commuting is bad because transit is bad:  there isn&#x27;t an interconnected, pervasive mesh of transit with capillaries reaching into neighborhoods and arteries connecting cities.  We&#x27;ve got Bart and Caltrain, but they&#x27;re each for the most part single corridors, and the local transit doesn&#x27;t link up well with it.  So, taking public transit costs lots of time and money.  The alternative that people have is to drive, but there are too many cars on the road, so driving takes lots of time and money.  The result is that people feel like they don&#x27;t have anywhere to go.<p>I&#x27;m not sympathetic to the argument &quot;I&#x27;ve lived here for NN years so I should be allowed to stay living here as long as I want, realities of economics aside&quot;.<p>I wonder if it would help if there were a governing body between county and state that comprised &quot;the bay area&quot;.  Individual cities and counties have to strike deals between each other to link transit, with all the usual crappiness that politics entails.  If a few counties (or cities that aren&#x27;t in the same county) have a disagreement, do they have any place to air their arguments aside from the state level?  People in LA don&#x27;t care about the bay area&#x27;s transit problems.  People outside the major metro areas (central valley, far-northern california) don&#x27;t care about the bay area&#x27;s transit problems.<p>Part of the problem is that low density begets low density:  all those cars need a place to be parked all day while their drivers work, so we have ~40-50% of the space in cities devoted to roads and parking.  Further, low density makes mass transit economically infeasible.<p>I don&#x27;t have a solution to offer.  I can&#x27;t see a way from where we are to the bay area I dream of, given the state of the economy and the politics involved.<p>Conclusion:  we should collapse the bay area into a point mass.

7040311,comment,7039043,7039270,18,0,stephp,,,"I&#x27;ve been considering what interested my 11-year-old {female} self about programming. The question keeps popping up, and the only answers I&#x27;ve seen are so vague that I feel something of a moral obligation to offer my own specific insight.<p>To put my experience in context, I didn&#x27;t know a single soul interested in programming IRL. So the only way I could have come to it is from a deeply genuine place.<p>In my adult life, I&#x27;ve heard many men talk about their excitement for coding/programming at a young age, and it is almost always about the love of simply building things. Because building is fun.<p>Unfortunately, my experience could not have been more different. Reflecting on my thought processes at that age, I remember it being entirely about 2 things:<p>1. Expression. Nothing could have sounded more dull than building aimlessly-- I wanted to DESIGN. (My definition of this being &quot;carrying out a specific communicative purpose through look and function.&quot;) I wanted to make a website that demonstrated my tastes and values to my friends. (Which is likely why I went straight to websites and not desktop software.)<p>2. Social dynamics. Similar but different to the aforementioned point, I wanted to actually affect other people with what I was making. As a young girl, that typically meant impressing potential friends and boyfriends. I had a poetry site at one point. I made sites for a fake band my girl friends and I talked about forming. I had tons of blogs. I really should have segued into games at that time, as that would have fallen in the same category, but sadly I did not.<p>That said-- while I know every human being is different, I was what you&#x27;d consider a &quot;girly girl.&quot; So I believe the difference between myself and a young boy was quite pronounced in a stereotypically feminine direction-- which is where one should be investigating a subject like this, in my opinion.<p>Though a different topic altogether, in case anyone&#x27;s interested in how this all played out in my adult life, I wrote an article called &quot;That Time I Declared Programming ‘Not My Thing’ and How to Turn Fear Into Action&quot; which can be found here: <a href""http://www.fairgroundmedia.com/turn-fear-into-actio"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.fairgroundmedia.com/turn-fear-into-action</a>.",1389395523

I had been drafted into this tutoring program in high school to help kids pass the big standardized test in Texas.  During a lull one of the teachers there, Mr. Vega, started chatting with me.  He saw that I was messing around with programming on my TI-83.  He said something like, &quot;Oh yeah, there&#x27;s lots of money in computers.  You should learn more about that.&quot;  And I mentioned that I had thought about taking a computer science class, and I had even thought about borrowing a textbook from the CS teacher to read over the summer.  He said, &quot;Oh yeah, you should definitely do that.&quot;  And so I did.  Looking back on it, it&#x27;s funny.  I somehow felt like I needed permission to learn programming.  But I kind of did.  And he gave it to me.  Just a tiny bit of encouragement was enough to get me on the path.<p>I guess the problem is ladies never get that tiny bit of encouragement.  Which suggests the problem might be shockingly easy to fix.  Just say, &quot;Hey, you.  Try programming.  Seriously.&quot;",1389395523

We just launched a landing page for a new product we&#x27;re developing and I thought that this could be a good opportunity to introduce ourselves to the HN community. The page I&#x27;m linking to is an MVP for a cloud-based calculator app designer that we hope will eventually replace Excel for the times when people want to build number-crunching solutions for use by other people. We&#x27;ve been doing spreadsheet-like calculator apps for some time now in the e-health industry -- calculating drug dosages and calculating the optimal nutrition for infants born too early. (My partner is a doctor with a Ph.D., which helps when you want to get into e-health.)<p>Along the way, we have built a lot of technology that makes building these kinds of apps very straight-forward. (It&#x27;s the Calcapp platform, allowing formulas to be described and user interfaces to be built using an XML-based language.) Along the way, I realized that the key is to enable people who are proficient in their domain but who are not software developers to create these kinds of apps. These folks are often comfortable with tools like Excel and use Excel to build their solutions. Thus the need for a cloud-based app designer taking the place of the XML language I designed, something that people used to Excel would be comfortable with. The MVP is an attempt to validate that there is a market for this kind of technology and to get useful feedback that can help us shape Calcapp Creator.<p>We&#x27;d like to get feedback from the HN community on the effectiveness of the landing page and on whether you believe that the idea itself is feasible.

But compassion and moral principle cannot be the main motives for leftist activism. Hostility is too prominent a component of leftist behavior; so is the drive for power. Moreover, much leftist behavior is not rationally calculated to be of benefit to the people whom the leftists claim to be trying to help. For example, if one believes that affirmative action is good for black people, does it make sense to demand affirmative action in hostile or dogmatic terms? Obviously it would be more productive to take a diplomatic and conciliatory approach that would make at least verbal and symbolic concessions to white people who think that affirmative action discriminates against them. But leftist activists do not take such an approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs. Helping black people is not their real goal. Instead, race problems serve as an excuse for them to express their own hostility and frustrated need for power. In doing so they actually harm black people, because the activists&#x27; hostile attitude toward the white majority tends to intensify race hatred.&quot;<p><a href""http://www.churchofeuthanasia.org/resources/fc/unabe2.html#c"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.churchofeuthanasia.org/resources/fc/unabe2.html#c...</a><p>I think the aim of making the tech industry friendlier to women is better served by continued outreach efforts, rather than making an example out of individuals arbitrarily.",1389394832

How do you think they make all those billions of dollars / year? Why are they providing you with free Gmail, Maps, and high quality search results? The answer is that they sell you to their customers. If you are in gmail and sent your mom an email telling her what kind of printer cartridges to buy, don't be surprised if you see an ad about printer cartridges. They indirectly sold your data ""interested in printer cartridges"" to their ""real"" customer -- the company that makes printer cartridges and is looking for someone to buy them.",1309802240

DRM or any type of copy-protection introduces complexity to reduce this basic functionality. Reduced functionality makes a product less useful to the user.<p>You could also say that lower cost versions of Windows 7 are crippled from the user's perspective. Parts of the OS are disabled so Microsoft can sell multiple editions at different price points. Functionality that exists is purposely reduced (crippled).<p>To use your example of Steam: it still disallows certain types of copying. It provides additional functionality, but Steam without DRM would be more useful to the end user. I could create my own offline back up copies and share copies with people not on Steam, etc. Obviously, this might be considered bad behavior for economic/ethical reasons but the functionality provided to the user is strictly reduced by the DRM.

I mean, I thought the whole point of a functional language is that there are no side effects and every expression returns some value. How is ""pure"" distinct from ""functional""?\n</code></pre>\nOh, no no. Pure is not required for functional programming. Functional programming is mostly defined as the ability to pass around functions as 1st class data types. In fact, I noticed on your GitHub you do some Python. Here is functional programming in Python:<p><pre><code>  # Sum a list in Python using FP\n  items = [1,2,3,4,5]\n  function = lambda x, y: x + y\n  reduce(function, items) # => 15\n\n  # The equivalent in haskell:\n  foldr1 (+) [1,2,3,4,5]\n</code></pre>\nPure is a stricter form of functional programming, which Haskell enforces.<p><pre><code>  edit: BTW, Haskell DOES have a steep learning curve, and the inherent recursion breaks my brain. Even simple things like:\n  `combos = []` `combos = combos + 'foo'`\n  hurt, because counterintuitively (to me, anyway) this winds up in infinite recursion. I'm very used to OOP so this sort of thing is hard on me. I'm old though.\n</code></pre>\nYou're stepping now into the ""lazy"" aspect of Haskell. You're allowed to have infinite recursion in Haskell because it is only evaluated when needed. I don't really want to get into it here since there are many resources online about it :) But this also isn't inherent to functional programming or pure function programming.",1309800083

Switches are the bane of most electrical engineers because they cost a lot and they have a finite lifetime. So generally they are thing that is going to 'kill' the product. And because they are both mechanical and have moving parts (in the non-capacitive variant) when they break the users just push harder trying to get them to work and that can crack traces on the circuit board and end the life of an otherwise working piece of gear.<p>Capacitive buttons can be 'tuned' (which is to say one can adjust how sensitive they are) somewhat depending on their antenna design and the ambient conditions. What is really hard for them is in a high emf environment (think lots of fourescents and shag carpets) there is so much charge available at your fingertip that even turned waay down they fire with the barest touch, reverse the circumstance like a modestly humid day out in a field somewhere and they are lucky if they can see your finger at all. If you're finger is wet (and thus charge will tend to distribute more evenly around you body) they are nearly worthless.<p>I recently saw some interesting 'piezo' buttons where they were effectively capacitive buttons but covered by a bit of piezo material so that you had to push on them to get them to activate. But while better in many ways, the cost difference between a button that is just a trace on the PCB (essentially free) and one that has a bit of piezo material in it (even if it only costs 2 or 3 cents) is easily someones salary when you're activating 500,000 devices a day.",1309799547

To celebrate July 4th, and because we could, we hired a special forces translator to help us create a version of our app designed for American military workers in Afghanistan (all 94K of them).<p>Many folks in Afghanistan have their iWhatever's with them, so we figured there are a lot of people that could use it, since learning some of the language can help immensely in building trust and rapport.<p>We took the Defense Foreign Language Institute's ""Survival Guide"" for Dari, (about 50 pages of PDF files) and then had the translator update the content and then record audio for each file. It only took some minor changes package it into our app. The biggest change was disabling the ""Slang Slider"" for many of the phrases- we want to make sure someone knows exactly what you mean when you say ""Don't shoot!"".<p>If we included all of the phrases, we couldn't get the app to fit under 20MB without doing something nasty to the audio quality (and if its over 20MB you can't download it over 3G). So we split it up into two- one version is for people in medicine, and one is for everyone else.<p>In total, the app includes over 750 phrases, 1600 dictionary entries, 600 word-bank entries, and articles about the local culture.<p>They're the only free apps we have right now (unless you count Pirate?).If you know someone over there, it could be useful to them:<p>Dari Version: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/triplingo-dari/id446506749?mt=8\nDari Medical Version: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dari-medical/id447155027?mt=8\nProduct Page: http://www.triplingo.com/products/afghanistan<p>Oh, and uh... happy 4th!",1309799262

The reason it seems fuzzy is that the modern US government likes to offload its regulations onto corporations and other entities. In the interest of ""protecting"" children, they subject online service providers to penalties for allowing children access. In turn, these services must restrict access by children in order to protect themselves from the government.<p>Thus, although the direct object of the action is Google -- a corporation -- it really is an act against the nanny state.",1309799215

The supply sites that do exists have really terrible web presences and they still do much of their business with paper catalogs.<p>Most of the stores don't have items categorized more than one level deep nor by the properties of the item. There are all sorts of options for something as simple as an anvil or a pair of tongs.<p>God help you if you need handle hardware. You have to go through 40 pages of little, crappy pictures of items to find what you're looking for.<p>When you go to checkout, you're lucky if you can complete your order without reloading your cart a half-dozen times.<p>Then there's the whole quality thing. There are vanishingly few reviews on these sites. If you could aggregate reviews on similar items, it would be great.<p>But a problem with aggregating reviews is that a certain part might be imported from China on one site and the same part might be laser cut in house on another site.

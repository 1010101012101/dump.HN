1881180,comment,1880334,1880964,0,0,jacobolus,,,"You can’t escape UI work in math, either. The comprehensibility of the notation system is crucial to forward progress. Which makes it unfortunate that a lot of mathematical notation ends up being unnecessarily arcane, taking ideas that make perfectly clear sense graphically or intuitively and mangling them into an impenetrable tangle. And I don’t think there are enough serious challenges to bad notation: if a notation has worked for a few people trying to prove things, others too often accept it and move on.<p>Some of the complexity may be necessary in the name of precision, but a lot of the time it’s simply a design failure. Part of the problem may be that it doesn’t seem like mathematicians get any real training in notation design or abstraction communication. Theorem proving exercises in school almost always stress rigor over clarity of explanation: proofs in homework are always either correct or not correct, and what is tested by them is students’ comprehension of existing notation and previously developed abstractions, but there is no exercise which tests students ability to invent <i>good new</i> abstractions or notations.",1289184759

If you tell him that he is missing ""a LOT"" you're giving him encouragement for him to leave that relationship to live the single lifestyle that is completely overblown by the media.<p>It's easy to tell people they are missing the best part of being in their twenties, when in reality it's not all that it's been made up to be, as the only thing it really contributes to one's life is a false sense of accomplishment.<p>Here's another golden nugget for the grandparent: Everyone talks about the single lifestyle, but that's a lifestyle suited for a really small fraction of the people that supposedly tell you it's the next big thing. You need a boatload of social skills that a great percentage of people don't really have, you need to be sort of successful at the moment, you need to have a way with women (which is something that comes from a boatload of experience), and you really need to have at least a couple of friends that are living it large as well.<p>I've seen friends make this exact same statement, that they are missing out and that they think they should leave the relationship they have and try the single lifestyle. It always blows up in their faces. In contrast, the two friends I had that really lived this lifestyle at the same time I did both realized they where going down fast and now one is married and the other one is engaged.<p>If there is one advice I can give you GP. If you have a couple of friends that tell you it's the greatest thing ever, the threesomes, the challenges, the satisfaction of bedding that model, etc... realize one thing, for every one of those men, there are hundreds (if not thousands) that won't achieve the same experiences, and the one's that do generally burn out pretty quickly. If you were single, I'd tell you to try it out and see what happens, but you're not and it would be a mistake to try to live it up just because. If you're happy with your significant other, don't sweat it, it's a lifestyle not worth your while.<p>Hell most people that do live it up like this don't do it because of a life choice, they do it because it's the only thing they have ever known, and it's a thing that just happened.

Couldn't some sort of user based distributed network be used for authentication? I mean we trust compilers and code patches (which do see many eyes) that we then load onto our PCs. Why can't we trust some similar mechanism of authority that is user based.",1289182202

I don't quite remember whether he also claimed that the alcohol actually <i>inhibits</i> the gluten-forming action of the rest of the water.<p>Clearly more data is needed. Or perhaps some primary-source citations, but they don't taste as good.<p>As for the soup phenomenon: It could well be a temperature thing, and I will put my vodka in the freezer next time and see how that goes. But it could also be a flour thing, I suppose. Every flour has a different protein content, every region has its favorite mix of flours (in the south, for example, you can actually buy the flour that makes Southern biscuits famously soft and tender), so unless we set out to use the same weight of the same flour we're going to tend to see different results. (My flour is King Arthur unbleached all-purpose, by the way. I'm not sure of the extent to which King Arthur is a national brand.)",1289182151

I found this computer half destroyed at a junk sale and spent a few hours and about $50 refurbishing it to usable condition.  Wouldn't have been able to afford it otherwise.  The HD was missing, so I threw in an old one.<p>Laptop - Asus 8JS.  Geforce 7700 graphics, 2Ghz Intel Core Duo, 2GB RAM, 120GB HD.  14"" screen with 1440x900 resolution (looks photorealistic on some games).<p>OS - Ubuntu 10.10 as primary.  Standard low-maintenance Linux, though occasionally I have to custom install something that has gone stale in the repositories.  I also have mostly unused Windows XP and Vista boots.<p>Code editing - Eclipse or Gedit.  I have rudimentary knowledge of VIM and painful memories of Emacs.  I code in a whole slew of languages and generally find that I'm either okay with the really simple text editor (Gedit) or want code completion and automated testing (Eclipse).  I also like to put SVN repos into a Dropbox.  It's a free way to keep my code private but still have it backed up and synchronized between computers.  I've used Git and Bazaar, never in a way that convinced me they were truly more advanced than SVN.<p>Web Browsing - Firefox.  Tried Chrome and Opera, and I think I'm just more used to Firefox now and can understand its quirks.  I was using Phoenix 0.4 back in high school, and people thought I was crazy.<p>Phone - was pretty uninterested in phones until Android came out.  Now I have an HD2 (that's a WinMo phone) that I'm hacking to run Android.<p>Sound - anything I can salvage.  People throw away tons of audio equipment.  I have a huge pair of Tannoy speakers that look like they could power a rock concert.  I think I have a usable amp for these, but I'm still figuring out how to wire everything.",1289181935

The laptop is run-of-the-mill, and the desktop is a dual Q6600 with 8GB Corsair and a couple 2Tb WD drives, housed in a gorgeous Lian-Li brushed aluminum 12-bay case and 3 24"" Acer monitors (cheap).  Keyboard is a Logitech G19, Mouse is a Logitech MX-9000.  Speakers are the little volume icon speakers from art.lebedev (they were a gift, but they're cool, and don't sound bad at all).

Newer stuff is mostly either Django behind either Apache or Nginx or, more recently, most of my stuff is with Tornado/Twister/Nginx (Twister is my management framework).<p>Databases: MySQL, MongoDB<p>The newest project I'm working on (Plum) is using the following: Nginx, Tornado, Python, Celery, RabbitMQ and MySQL & MongoDB and Memcache.  Steve built a beautiful MySQL / Memcache abstraction layer he calls BPEngine that acts as our ORM, but in addition that, it also populates / expires / manages keeping memcache seeded & updated, as well as kicking off requisite tasks into celery for some of the backend work.<p>That covers almost everything I can think of.",1289181928

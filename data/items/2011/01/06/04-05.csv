2074077,comment,2073737,2073737,0,0,noibl,,,"In a lot of the comments around this lately, people have been saying that this is something Google can fix, or needs to fix.<p>I would suggest that the content farms' success in gaming specifically Google's algorithm was an inevitability (whatever the current state of the arms race) and the only thing that will weaken the effectiveness of their techniques is to expose their business model to a greater range of algorithms. If you have three or four search engines all working on slightly different principles, it becomes a lot harder to game them all with the same content, even if gaming any one of them would be trivial. In other words, competition in the SE space at the algorithmic level is something we sorely need to see.<p>In parallel, my suggestion for one new search engine to add to the mix: a crawler for unsubsidised content. That is, the results consist solely of pages that don't carry advertising of any kind. This wouldn't exclude ecommerce sites but would exclude most kinds of affiliate marketing. Subscriber-only sites could pay to be indexed at a flat rate, though guaranteeing that this fee wouldn't affect rankings might be tricky. Alternatively a journal-access style of subscription model could see the SE paying the content site owner when one of its paying users consumes their information.",1294289872

There was once a democratized web era when that actually worked -- when millions of people had their little Goecities pages and were linking the cool stuff -- but in the modern era it's 99% consumers who cast no votes, and the last 1% is extraordinarily incestuous circular link love: Marcos links to Coding Horror who links to Daring Fireball who links to Scoble who links to Marcos, etc.<p>People with neither information or authority end up being the credible authority on matters they have aren't authorities on. Scoble a few years back pointed out the fact that according to search engines he was the most important Robert in the world. That is a frightening concept.<p>We will move from an era of search engines to an era of expert engines. Many of the questions I used to ""ask"" Google I now ask of Wolfram Alpha, and its approach has turned out to be quite useful. Expand that computer knowledge more broadly, and improve the human syntax parsing. and we'll have a winner.

Mainly because I am a total food geek.<p>I have to say that yes, getting started is a pain, and yes, the easy way seems, well, easier, but better food is a HELL YES reason to overcome the first two.<p>Just like your startup, starting to get a healthy kitchen going requires a lot of investment before you start to see any outcome.  Deep Breath.  You're going to need to go... Shopping.<p>But, once you're boot strapped with supplies, regular top ups is all that's required.  I feel better when I eat crap less then I eat well.  It's sorta annoying, but not once you get into the rhythm of it.<p>Provided food is a great idea if it's good quality.  Providing junk at the workplace just exacerbates the issue.  That said, it's not too hard to prepare extra meals at home and bring them to the office, especially if you can convince your founder/self to install a chest freezer.  Sure, fresh stuff is usually better, but don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.<p>Microwaves rock when you don't use them as a magic-1-button-make-hot machine.  You can cook grains, make sauces, steam things and even do some poaching in a Nucleonic Oven, as long as you're not totally impatient.

2074057,comment,2073832,2073832,0,0,Loginid,,,"First off, don't beat yourself up - 20 min is good. Just make sure that 20 min work periods are punctuated with 5 min break periods.<p>I have ADD (not ADHD), but here is what works for me.<p>1. Drugs - After much resistance to the idea as well as near exhaustive experimentation with alternative therapies, I tried Concerta and was amazed at the results. On the night of my first dose I had what felt like the best sleep of my life.<p>2. Awareness and understanding of the symptoms - If you are like me, you are not procrastinating because you lack focus -- you are procrastinating to achieve focus. You are effectively self-medicating with adrenaline. The resultant constant anxiety about both not working and upsetting your wife keeps you sharp as well. You still are going to need the 'fix', but strive to get them from either drugs, or different behaviors.<p>The solution for me was to strategically fill all of my 'free-time'. It sounds like you have a wife and kids, so this should be easy. Lean into being a good husband and father. Block out dedicated family time where you are focusing on them and not stray thoughts about work. It is the 'limbo' state where you are present at home but thinking about something else that is the killer.<p>Make sure that this time is centered around an activity - not TV/Computer. Cooking. Washing dishes. Doing Laundry. Playing with the kids (for real). Painting the guest room.<p>This does 2 things: it keeps your family happy, and leaves you just enough time to cram in work when it is time to work. Too much time on any one task will put you in 'limbo'. I'm sure that your problem isn't just at work, I'm willing to bet that you are not making a habit of being present in the moment. Off hours practice being present at home will only help things.<p>Also, it sounds like you know that boring problems make you procrastinate. It may be worth looking into ways to make boring problems interesting...<p>3. Administrative Pre-Planning - I know that trying to work around anything that could derail my attention is not going to work. The solution is really as simple as removing the possibility for those distractions to occur.<p>Seriously - Restrict your internet access with site-blocking , headphones to keep co-workers away (even without music - I can't listen to music / TV when I am trying to work). Whatever your triggers for 'limbo' are, acknowledge them and make sure that you have no chance of being exposed. Not ever.<p>4. Unwavering Planned Routine - This doesn't work without #2 and #3. I could never stick to routines because I needed the rush that I got from a chaotic lifestyle. When you turn it around, you can get almost the same rush by being optimally effective at any one time. You can race the clock for your fix. If you have to decide at any given time what to be optimally effective at, you will deliberate and go into 'limbo'. Pre-planned routine is a good way of overcoming the impulsivity and reduced long-term executive-cognition that is characteristic of the condition.",1294289539

2074046,comment,2072200,2074007,0,0,brc,,,"Why?  Why is that disturbing?  This is a genuine question.<p>It doesn't disturb me one bit.  As long as each generation is relatively wealthier than the prior one, I don't care about the spread within that generation.<p>My grandfather died of pneumonia at age 56 due to a lack of oxygen and antibiotics at the hospital. They didn't have enough money to paint their house and instead used old tractor sump oil. My parents, when married, didn't have hot water or a toilet inside the house.  They had never travelled more than 200 miles from their place of birth.<p>My kids have access to better health, leisure, education, food and housing than even I did, which is not that long ago.<p>This continual improvement in wealth amongst my own family is proof enough that the very rich aren't impinging on what really matters, which is improving living standards for the majority of people.<p>Paraphrasin PG in one of his essays - it doesn't disturb me that Mozart was 1 million times more musically talented than I am, or that Tiger Woods is 10 million times better at golf.  Their ability and success doesn't impede on my life at all - if anything - it improves it.  It's not unfair (in any real sense) that Federer can play tennis very well and I can't hit the ball to save myself.  So why is it unfair that someone has talent at making money and can make a million times more money than I can?  In a free society, (apart from a very tiny minority who steal or lie their way to it) the only way they can get (and stay) rich is by providing excess value to everyone else.  That's true whether you are kicking a ball, trading stocks or building software.<p>Nobody has ever successfully convinced me why wealth disparity in a free society is a problem.

Then cur_len_ + str_len = 2147483647 + 1000 = -2147482649 < 1024, so the first if passes, and my data gets copied to the heap past the end of the allocated buffer.<p>This might crash the program in this case, but if I have more memory and can control all parts of the URL, I could arrange to only write a few bytes over, change headers used by the allocator, and exploit the system.<p>It took me longer to write this comment than it did to find something dubious in the codebase, so I'd strongly suggest auditing the library carefully before using it.",1294288957

It took many years for Einstein's theory to get sufficient proof as to be accepted.  Einstein himself said something like ""You cannot solve a problem from the same level of consciousness that created it"".  I think it is reasonable to assume that our current medical assumptions are part of the problem when it comes to autism, which has reached ""epidemic proportions"" according to some articles.<p>I am not suggesting a path of nihilism.  I am only suggesting that I recognize that the reasons I do things and the thinking I use to make such decisions doesn't look very ""logical"" to quite a lot of people.  This is highly likely to be true for people arguing from the ""scientific"" position.  Yet, we are all human, even scientists, and thus even they have their biases, shortcomings, etc.  I made the choice I made not due to anecdotal evidence but due to a track record of success:  These people were helping me get concrete results in terms of a health problem for which ""science"" would like to write me off and consign me to a slow, torturous death as my only due in life.  These same people had strong negative views of vaccines.  I went with the folks who were getting me positive results.  My other choice is to go along with conventional treatments for my condition.  Everyone who does that gets gradually sicker and sicker until they die, usually at a young age.  Science claims it is not killing them, it is their genes that is killing them.<p>To me, that position lacks logic -- but the overwhelming belief is that it is true, so that makes me a lone nutcase.  And it is usually a hopelessly lost cause to attempt to point this out when everyone ""just knows"" they are right, science and doctors are on their side, and I am ""objectively"" wrong, nevermind the results I am getting.  Those results can be easily dismissed as ""anecdotal"".  I didn't get well to impress anyone or make any kind of point. I only did this to get my life back (and give my kids a life of their own).  So it is mostly not worth arguing about.  Those folks who do not believe me cannot be convinced.  The fact that it is a done deal weighs nothing in their minds.<p>Peace.",1294287656

Eating the same thing every day gets real old real fast;<p>3. There is an investment required in cooking in terms of equipment, etc;<p>4. Cooking takes time between shopping, cleaning and the actual cooking. That's time that could be better spent doing many other things.<p>5. Even getting something for lunch can be a huge time sink and minimally takes half an hour unless you're eating out of a hot dog stand right outside your office.<p>This is why I'm a huge fan of companies providing a cafeteria or some find of catered meals. Of course, this requires both being a certain size and obviously costs money but, I would argue, the cost is well worth it in terms of:<p>- variety of meals\n- not needing to shop, cook or clean\n- time saved in not going out for lunch and other transit\n- time that can be spent talking over work-related stuff while eating with your colleagues\n- other intangible benefits such as the team-building aspects of socializing with your colleagues<p>These benefits are so huge I think that it'd be worth having everyone chip in to pay for something like this and would probably be an economic form of eating.<p>Now I'm lucky enough to work somewhere that has almost legendary catered meals (Google), which must cost them a fortune (eg dinner was steamed mussels, beef stroganoff, garlic whipped potatoes, green beans, steamed broccoli and a pineapple and blueberry salad, and that's just what I had) but IMHO they make their money back in terms of employee satisfaction and saved time on all of the above things.<p>Fact is I have more variety of food than I'd ever cook myself (or probably even buy).<p>That of course is a cafeteria type situation. Like I said, on a smaller scale, catered meals are a cost-effective doing this on a smaller scale.

Suppose you don't know Lisp, but you've seen many respectable people such as Paul Graham and Steve Yegge describe how great Lisp is for metaprogramming. This doesn't mean that you know the fact ""Lisp => great for metaprogramming""! What you know is the fact ""Many respectable people think => 'Lisp => great for metaprogramming'"". This is an important distinction! It means you probably shouldn't talk about Lisp and metaprogramming, and if you do talk, you should make sure that you deliver the right fact, i.e. ""I've heard that Lisp is good for metaprogramming"", not ""Lisp is good for metaprogramming"".<p>> What I fear is looking incredible.<p>I'd rather that you fear <i>being</i> incredible (which it appears you are).<p>A resource that helped me think much more precisely about what I know and the level of confidence I have in that is the rationalist writings of Eliezer Yudkowsky.

Combat is one strategy that could prove beneficial (since you avoid the cost of mining/production by just taking it from their wreckage), but with minimal effort, you should be able to outrun/avoid most of these 'pirates'.<p>2) By employing some sort of hosted code, you can organise some sort of a market for code snippets/components, encouraging people to share what they have done in a variety of ways, on teh basis that profitting from it being used by others outweighs the cost of others using it against you.<p>3) It doesn't need all that complexity to start, or even in the same game.  But the complexity helps to some extent by making it harder for a single abusable game mechanic to control the whole system.

I like the idea of a turn based strategy game, with ~30s per turn.<p>Create a point system. How points are won doesn't really matter, but make it something interesting. Point reset every week. When they reset, the person with the highest amount of points gets to make a new ""rule"". This could be anything from a new ability for a unit to a change in the way the physics work. It (obviously) has to be tested and verified, but would be deployed relatively quickly. This process iterates for as long as desired.<p>Obviously a number of iterations will cause problems of complexity eventually.

That means you have to research the job/company/ask questions before answering the recruiter.<p>You can`t change an industry.

The advantage is the host could make modifications to the game mechanics itself (just like any other game).<p>The alternative would be to develop the server with the 'cloud' in mind. Meaning, there would most likely only be one large game server that perhaps managed 'instances' of matches. The advantage here is that you avoid fragmenting an already small pool of players.",1279814556

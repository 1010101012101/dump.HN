Getting this functionality in git is great. And it&#x27;ll mean a huge step forward in collaboration tools for game developers. You pretty much can&#x27;t avoid big binary files when making games - and so far they&#x27;ve been stuck with SVN or Perforce (or the more adventurous ones are trying out PlasticSCM, which apparently is pretty nice too, but is proprietary and doesn&#x27;t have a big ecosystem around it like git does). I hope this can lead to a boom of game developers using git.",1443729591

10314205,comment,10311654,10312918,0,0,mleonhard,,,"I downloaded the paper.  It does not credit the highschool student&#x27;s discovery.  The authors take credit for the discovery themselves:<p>&quot;Recently, we reported that waxworms (the larvae of the
Indian mealmoth or Plodia interpunctella) were capable of
chewing and eating PE films, and two bacterial strains capable
of degrading PE were isolated from the gut of the worms, i.e.,
Enterobacter asburiae YT1 and Bacillus sp. YP1. During the
same research period, we found that mealworms, the larvae of
the mealworm beetle or Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus (a species of
darkling beetle), which are much larger in size than waxworms
(typically approximately 25 versus 12 mm in length), can eat
Styrofoam as their sole diet.&quot;<p>They seem to have duplicated the 2009 highschool student&#x27;s work.  Here is the highschool student&#x27;s abstract:<p>&quot;The observation that mealworms might be able to feed on styrofoam sparked a curiosity to answer whether mealworms could digest styrofoam, and if so, how could they remain alive. First of all, these mealworms were fed in different kinds of food to insure the mealworms can digest styrofoam. The results showed that mealworms can indeed feed on styrofoam only. The hypothesis of this study is that microbes inside the digestive tracts of mealworms are responsible for the decomposition of styrofoam. To further test this hypothesis, microbes from the digestive tracts of mealworms were cultured at 37 C in LB medium under anaerobic conditions. There were many kinds of microbes isolated. From those microbes, a kind of bacteria forming red colonies was confirmed responsible for decomposing styrofoam. The growth conditions and strain characteristics of the bacteria forming red colonies were further examined. These results imply that the red bacteria isolated from the digestive tracts of mealworms may shed light on solving the serious environmental pollution caused by styrofoam.&quot;<p><a href=""https://apps2.societyforscience.org/abstracts/project.cfm?PID=MI020&Year=2009"" rel=""nofollow"">https://apps2.societyforscience.org/abstracts/project.cfm?PI...</a>",1443729502

The reason Google and Apple TV devices have a bad Amazon Prime experience, I suspect, is because they want a huge cut of revenue from Amazon Prime viewership (just as they expect a huge cut of revenue for anything sold on their platform), and they aren&#x27;t being reasonable about getting it. The notion that these services can be profitable, can pay creators a reasonable amount, and can be offered at a fair price to consumers, while <i>also</i> paying massive rents to the platform owners is questionable, at best. If your margins are razor thin, having a company demand 30% for that last mile to the customer is probably not sustainable.<p>Amazon is not faultless, but it is bad actors all around in this situation. Somebody needs to break the 30% model. I don&#x27;t think this move from Amazon will do it for the industry as a whole (though Apple and Google might work on a compromise specifically with Amazon), but I understand entirely why they&#x27;re doing it.

I remember a few years a go here in the Netherlands there was a price war going on between supermarkets and the producers were caught in the middle, and as a result of ever-dropping prices they did start to complain that it was anti-competitive to allow supermarkets to also be producers as in an ideal market it would be impossible for the producers to offer the same price-point for the same products.

Tempo Automation | San Francisco, CA | On-site (remote on a case by case basis)<p>Tempo Automation is a venture-backed robotics start-up that is building the quick-turn electronics factory of the future. The goal of Tempo is simple and delightful; we want to make hardware development happen at the pace of software development. Our process starts with our website where we ingest customer designs, perform design for manufacturing reviews, price circuit boards and components, and automatically generate a quote. Once a customer is happy with their design our factory swings into action using a mixture of our own proprietary robots, traditional manufacturing equipment, and good old-fashioned hard work.  Using this model Tempo is already delivering prototype circuit boards in the Bay Area in as little as three days. We are seeking talented and hardworking engineers, technicians, and operations people to help us radically change electronics manufacturing. Current open positions include the following:<p>* Senior and mid-level &quot;back-end&quot; and &quot;full-stack&quot; software engineers. We are a Django/Linux/Python shop.<p>* Junior and senior roboticists in both software and mechatronics. We&#x27;re a ROS shop!<p>* Software Operations<p>* Factory Operations and Logistics.<p>* Generally Useful Graphic Designers<p>* Assembly Technicians<p>* Office Manager<p>A full list of positions can be found here: <a href=""http://www.tempoautomation.com/home/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tempoautomation.com/home/careers</a><p>For more information contact us at : careers [at] tempoautomation.com<p>Note: as a policy Tempo Automation does not work with recruiters, ever.",1443727602

It&#x27;s a competitive business and the same deals pop up in more than one place.<p>I used to get eye drops and vitamins on Amazon, the everyday price at CVS is higher than Amazon but they regularly go on sale at CVS and I do just as well by just timing the purchase. I&#x27;m in CVS all the time anyway.<p>I haven&#x27;t made a major purchase like a TV this year but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d do fine if I waited for a specific sale or the general holiday season deals.<p>And sometimes I just don&#x27;t buy something at all. I started out not wanting to buy from Amazon because of how they treat their employees and business partners. In the process of rethinking that I also realized I don&#x27;t need to be buying so much stuff anyway. I used to throw in items so I&#x27;d qualify for free shipping on $25 (now $35) orders. Now I buy fewer things, only when I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll really use them. Instead of building up a backlog of books I&#x27;ll get to someday, I buy one when I&#x27;m ready to start reading it.<p>I bought a pair of $8 earphones from Best Buy and got free shipping for it alone, at Amazon it would have been $6 but shipping would have been extra unless I bought more. The cost of Prime amortized to my number of purchases would not be a good shipping rate. (I&#x27;m not interested in the other Prime benefits.)<p>I&#x27;ve found that dropping loyalty to any one retailer gives me the best overall experience and/or the best deals.",1443727061

Thou art avenged!&quot; but decided to stay away from the link bait. That and I hugely admire Linus. I actually think they were both right.<p>For those who don&#x27;t know, I am referring to the epic smack down that occurred many years ago between Tenenbaum and Torvalds over microkernels:<p><a href=""http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/appa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/appa.html</a><p>I think Tenenbaum was right from a theoretical, academic point of view, but Torvalds was right from a pragmatic ship-it-now point of view. He was also right from an early 1990s point of view.<p>Linus was right because monolithic kernels are easier to build and faster for monolithic system use cases. In the 1990s, individual commodity computer systems were really not fast enough for extreme multi-tenancy beyond maybe multi-purpose use within an organization. This is the sort of multi-tenancy Unix was designed for: a box used by, say, a team or a university department. For this use case a monolithic kernel makes sense for performance and simplicity reasons. The advantages of microkernels just don&#x27;t matter much, since the box generally has one admin and all the users are trusted. Messing with the kernel is not a big deal.<p>But then Moore&#x27;s law happened. Now just about anything above a Raspberry Pi is fast enough to host <i>lots</i> of stuff. Big servers with dozens of cores can host hundreds, sometimes even thousands of services. While they only take up single racks, these machines are &quot;main frames&quot; in the classical sense and can easily see diverse work loads belonging to multiple clients. It&#x27;s incredibly wasteful to single-purpose these machines and let them sit idle.<p>So far we&#x27;ve hacked around this with virtualization mostly, but virtualization is heavy and ugly. Think of it as a thick microkernel that runs a bunch of other whole kernels as services.<p>On huge machines the advantages of microkernels really shine. You can extend the system without having &#x27;root&#x27; in a global sense. Crashes of individual system extensions don&#x27;t bring down the whole machine. Everything is multi-threaded to take advantage of lots and lots of cores. It&#x27;s even possible to run system services in jails where they only have access to the resources they need so that a compromise (e.g. buffer overflow) in a driver does not permit compromise of the entire system.<p>So in the end I think Moore&#x27;s Law has turned the debate a bit toward Tenenbaum. But Linux has so much momentum I doubt it&#x27;s going anywhere. Instead I think we will see Linux evolve toward being more microkernel-y in the areas where this is most desirable. Network virtualization is one such area. Another is security zones. Soon we&#x27;ll have really secure containers, allowing Docker multi-tenancy, etc.<p>But I wouldn&#x27;t count out alternatives either. There&#x27;s an opportunity here for something like Hurd if they could ever get that thing really moving. (Get the Hurd moving... huh huh huh...)<p>Edit: Torvalds was also right because Mach, at least at the time of the debate, was pretty slow. Mach is still not the best microkernel design.

In this case they also adjust the lighting in scenes with less motion as it has less effect on the contrast of the image.<p>In general all of these tests will &quot;cheat&quot; because there is no way around it, you can measure the TV usage while playing content from the built-in antenna with 50% brightness and 10% audio, and you can test it while streaming 4K video over wifi while recording a show from you setup box using the HDMI in to a USB attached storage at full brightness, in 3D 120hz mode.<p>The difference in the power usage in that case will be quite insane.<p>The problem begins with the whole grading system, people want to see the green A on anything they buy because they assume it will be of higher quality, this plus moronic testing and standards is what will push any manufacturer to cheat under any circumstances.<p>But when you brand TV&#x27;s with AC&#x27;s, Fridges, Washing Machines, Heaters etc. with exactly the same A++ to G when A it self isn&#x27;t even green don&#x27;t expect manufacturers to not cheat, it&#x27;s a quite a big hit to get a yellow/orange/red marker on your product and it&#x27;s not some minor detail that is hidden in small text it&#x27;s marked very clearly usually it&#x27;s bigger or as big as the image of the product on that details page/sticker they have by it on the shelf.<p>The power consumption of TV&#x27;s is pretty much meaningless the powered consumption shouldn&#x27;t be tested at all just the standby power which in some cases is quite insane even for A rated TV&#x27;s, this isn&#x27;t a multi KW device like an air conditioning or heating which has quite a bit of impact.<p>Oh and just to make it clearer they actually do not measure the standby power consumption of TV&#x27;s at all for this rating which is actually probably several orders of magnitude more important because my Sony Bravia which is rated A+ barely powers down in standby mode vs lowest brightness since even in standby it&#x27;s connected to the network and does some voodoo while it should be well off and it like probably every other TV out there is probably on only 10% of the time at most.",1443726764

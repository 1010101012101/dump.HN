You have to file electronically, and then call the customs office on the phone, giving them a small window for your arrival. You used to just be able to have ATC advise customs of your ETA.<p>It&#x27;s to the point where when I need to go to Windsor, Canada, I will often overfly the Windsor airport, cross back into the US, land at Detroit (either Metro or City airport) and rent a car to drive back into Canada. If I just overfly Canada but takeoff and land in the US, it&#x27;s still a domestic flight and I avoid all the hassle.<p>I&#x27;m sure if I did it more often that it would become routine and seem less arcane and fraught with peril, but I only have occassion to do it a couple times per year, max, and Detroit is really close to Windsor anyway, so it&#x27;ll stay a mystery for me until I go island hopping the Carribean.

The flight plan is also useful in case you get into trouble, since it contains the identifying information for your plane, the number of people on board, and for instance the safety equipment on board. So if you crash, the search-and-rescue people know what to expect.<p>Depending on the system the place you&#x27;re flying to uses, filing the plan might be filling a web form. At least in Finland you could also do that via a phone call or with radio.<p>If there are customs and passport formalities between the countries you travel to, you will need to taxi your plane to a &#x27;customs control&#x27; parking lot on the airport so that the customs people can check it. On some small airports this may require alerting them ahead of time so that they&#x27;ll actually be there.<p>You probably also have to have a radio and a transponder on the airplane.<p>Between some countries, like the EU/Schengen area, flying between countries is pretty much the same as flying inside a country. So the requirements mostly depend on airspace restrictions in the area you fly. Between other countries things may vary. For example, back then I was told that it is quite impossible to fly from Finland to Russia since there was essentially no GA in Russia.<p>(disclaimer: it has been nearly 10 years since I flew last time, so some of this may be incorrect or outdated)",1392894569

While it&#x27;s true that more accidents happen with small GA aircraft, it isn&#x27;t really the dangerous activity non-fliers make it out to be. When accidents do occur, it&#x27;s almost always due to some very poor decisions made on the part of the pilot - taking off over wight, bad weather/icing, shoddy maintenance, etc.<p>I started out with GA flying and later became a flight instructor, then moved on to flying small turboprops (into some very treacherous airports), and now fly jets with an airline. I&#x27;ve never known anyone personally who has been killed or injured in an aircraft accident. Even flying for an airline, I&#x27;m baffled by the sense of danger some passengers feel by going up in a large jet.<p>Here&#x27;s a startup that&#x27;s trying to reverse the decline of GA flying - OpenAirplane.com. They launched last year and have caught on pretty quickly. It&#x27;s a universal rental checkout for GA pilots, such as the OP. Get checked out in, say, a Cessna 172 in Detroit, and you&#x27;re set to rent a similar Cessna 172 in Florida. The requirement for a checkout at each operator from which one wants to rent can be a roadblock for would-be renters, and this solves the problem. The company has the backing of most major aviation insurance providers and even Cessna Aircraft Company.",1392894393

But what makes you think that bands will be able to turn a profit when everything is free? Where there is no scarcity, there is no price.</i><p>There you go again. (I'm very sorry that you're getting picked on in this thread, but you're throwing up a straw man that's very conveniently simple to argue against.) Your assumption is that the <i>current</i> model of music - the broken one - is the only <i>possible</i> model of music. It's not. There are certainly solutions to be had. The problem is that the RIAA is not taking said solutions.<p>The company to root for is the company that figures out a model that works for bands <i>despite</i> pirating and an oversaturated market. Thinking there's no hope won't help anything.",1235051555

A 4 continent around the world ticket costs about $2000 and be sure to pick a good airlines network for the destinations you want. Or just pick two or three places and stay there 4 to 6 months at a time, or longer.<p>You can definitely spend time on your future projects while traveling, many places have free wireless internet. We used to hack on BBS systems, so even 512k Internet can let you do a lot of stuff. If connection stops working, go hiking or canoeing or off to meet a pretty girl/guy/whatever you like.<p>Oh, I second that other advise by inerte:<p><pre><code>  > - Pay some debt close family members have (parents, brothers)\n</code></pre>\nTry to minimize the potential emergencies of close ones, you don't need to pay them off completely but get them in a path where they can restore themselves to financial freedom. This is happening a lot already. Beware, don't bail out anybody on mortgage, specially if highly leveraged, they have negative equity, or have interest-only mortgages! There are laws to protect them and your money will get wasted for nothing. Perhaps help them <i>after</i> they file bankruptcy (IANAL.)<p>Whatever you do, have a good time! :)",1235051422
487237,comment,486755,486755,0,0,giardini,,,"If you don't own a home then buy one. Buy it as a home, not as an investment, so the smaller the better. If possible, buy a home in an area that has no homeowners' association and associated fees. If you don't, you will eventually regret it. You could buy a ""fee simple townhome"", which means it's small (condo-size) and has no association fees.<p>The reason I say buy not as an investment is because the real estate market hasn't nearly hit bottom yet and won't for another two years. Until then investing significantly in real estate would be a mistake. So buy something modest that you like in an area that you like.<p>Cash is king right now. Being in Canadian currency is good. Read Nassim Taleb, who presciently suggested years ago that we avoid investing heavily in the stock markets; they're too risky. Instead put ~90% into absolutely safe investments and then bet the remaining 5-10% in long-shot positive ""black swans"" (e.g, high technology and biotech ventures with long odds but incredible payoffs). Most often you'll lose but, when you win you'll win huge, more than enough to cover your losses. To understand his suggestions, you'd best read his excellent book, ""The Black Swan"".<p>And I assume you've split your money into various accounts so that you are insured against any losses should your bank go out of business.",1235051210

As you can live on the interest, perhaps the free time is more important than the money for now?<p>Sounds like a good time to invest in yourself.  First: a small vacation (a few weeks, ~$2-5k) to really relax.  Next: maybe some school if there were other things that piqued your interest before, but never had a chance to study.  If not school, maybe not a bad time to just pick up some books and hedonistically blowing weeks on whatever you want to study :-)  If anyone asks, call it market research.<p>Congrats!",1235050071

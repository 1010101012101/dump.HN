What the government said was true and what the tech CEOs said was true, yet they seemed to contradict each other. This was a case of careful politicking from all sides.<p>The thing that confuses me, is did the CEOs really think this contradiction would go in their favor? In other words, did they think no one would call them on that and they would be able to get away with it? Their statements attempted to seem very forward: &quot;Our company &#x27;never&#x27; granted &#x27;any&#x27; backdoor access&quot; etc. But as a result of that feeling so contradictory to the statements of the government, it necessitated further prying.",1370667519

So if your app supports one version of a given extension but your toolkit supports another, you can&#x27;t predict which version of that extension you will get.</i><p>Easy solution: open multiple connections.  Resources can be shared between connections.  (You missed the <i>actual</i> problem with X11 here, which is its current limit of 256 clients.  But that&#x27;s easily fixed with an &quot;X12&quot;.)<p>> <i>III) Many years ago, someone had an idea Mechanism, not policy. What did that mean? It means that X has its own X-Specific drawing API,</i><p>That&#x27;s not at all what that means.  &quot;Mechanism, not policy&quot; means the X11 core protocol leaves things like window managers and clipboard selection unspecified.  (The ICCCM spec takes care of this.)  This is sound design.<p>> <i>it is its own toolkit like GTK+ or Qt.</i><p>Wow, not at all.  What do toolkits have to do with drawing primitives?<p>> <i>It defined the low-level things, such as lines, wide-lines, arcs, circles, rudimentary fonts and other &#x27;building block&#x27; pieces that are completely useless on their own.</i><p>Don&#x27;t like it?  Ignore it and use GLX.  X11 is extensible for a reason.<p>> <i>Media Coherence. Whats Media Coherence? In its simplest terms... Your browser window? That&#x27;s a window. Your flash player window on youtube? The flash player itself, displaying the video, is a sub-window. What keeps them in sync? Absolutely nothing. The events are handled separately and right now you just pray that they don&#x27;t get processed too far apart.</i><p>WTF?  This is exactly what the Sync extension is for.<p>> <i>Please generate me a config file........Please actually USE this config file. Why?? Eventually fixed by making the X-server only use a config file for overrides and making it know and have SANE defaults / auto-detection.</i><p>This is an argument against XFree86, not X11.  <i>Nothing</i> about X11 dictates XFree86&#x27;s strange configuration mechanism.<p>> <i>Who&#x27;s ever had problems with multiple monitors under Linux?

If your distro is broken and doesn&#x27;t ship with a decent configuration tool, <i>that will be a problem with Wayland too</i>.<p>> <i>The window tree is a complete mess. Under X every input and text box was its own window which was parented by the window above it.</i><p>Why?  Nothing about X11 dictates you must design programs or toolkits like this.  Methinks you&#x27;re confusing &quot;X&quot; with &quot;Athena toolkit&quot;.<p>> <i>Its a nitpick, but its also a valid concern... Under X11, the global pixel counter is 15bits.

X11 <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> care about window types <i>by design</i>.  The ICCCM and EWMH specs are where these things are  by design!  defined!

5843816,comment,5838670,5842256,4,0,colmmacc,,,"I&#x27;d say that the advice is outdated, but I&#x27;ll try my best to explain and you can decide.<p>&quot;Bailiwick&quot; is the term used for the namespace a nameserver is considered authoritative for. If example.com is delegated to ns1.example.com then all of the DNS names ending in example.com are in-bailiwick. foo.example.com, bar.example.com, foo.bar.example.com and so on. If example.org is also delegated to ns1.example.com, then names ending in example.org are also considered in-bailiwick for that name-server to return.<p>When example.com is delegated to ns1.example.com there&#x27;s an obvious circular dependency; how can ns1.example.com be resolved without first resolving example.com? The way that this is solved is by using glue records. A glue record is when you tell the name-servers for the parent zone (.com in this case) what the IP address for ns1.example.com is. That way the com servers - when asked about www.example.com can say;  &quot;actually, you need to ask ns1.example.com, and by the way here&#x27;s the IP address for ns1.example.com&quot;.<p>With an in-bailiwick delegation and glue record in place, a query can get all the way to the server it needs within 2 or 3 queries.<p>Now, if example.com is delegated to ns1.otherdomain.net, the delegation is out of bailiwick. Now when the resolver asks the com server for www.example.com it gets a response that says &quot;you need to ask ns1.otherdomain.net&quot;. But the resolver doesn&#x27;t know the IP address for ns1.otherdomain.net. So now it has to put the original query on-pause and go and resolve ns1.otherdomain.net. This is part of why resolvers are called &quot;recursive resolvers&quot; - they have to recursively resolve all dependencies.<p>Of course ns1.otherdomain.net could itself require out-of-bailiwick recursion, and the process could get quite lengthy. That&#x27;s why some guides recommend against it - especially when managing you&#x27;re own DNS; you may as well make everything in-bailiwick.<p>So how do we manage this? A few ways;<p>Firstly, there&#x27;s no reason that managed DNS customers can&#x27;t use in-bailiwick names anyway. Route 53 customers, for example, are free to create their own names that resolve to their Route 53 name-servers and to use those names. For a real world example, if you &quot;dig amazonaws.com&quot; you&#x27;ll see that we have four names ; r[1234].amazonaws.com that actually point to regular Route 53 IP addresses.<p>Secondly, the nameserver names used by large providers are usually well cached. At Route 53 we host a lot of customers domains, and many many domains refer to each name like &quot;ns-22.awsdns-02.com.&quot;, so for that reason the names are usually very well-cached, even if your own domain is low-traffic.<p>Thirdly, we chose TLDs that are large, popular and well-run. .com/.net are operated under a single contract by verisign, so if you do; &quot;dig allcosts.net @g.gtld-servers.net&quot; , you&#x27;ll see that our .com and .net customers actually get the benefit of two in-bailiwick glue records (we have two nameservers that end in .com or .net). Customers with domains ending in .org or .co.uk get one each.<p>Fourthly, our nameserver domains are themselves exclusively delegated to in-bailiwick names, for example if you do; &quot;dig awsdns-50.net. @g.gtld-servers.net&quot;, you&#x27;ll see that all four of its nameservers are handled as glue-records. This limits the amount of recursion a resolver must do to just one level deep.<p>Our goal here is to be able provide a simple easy-to-use set of names that work well and are robust regardless of the customer&#x27;s own domain of choice, without having to maintain hundreds of nameserver names in every single TLD.",1370666114

Nixon signed the Banking Secrecy Act requiring banks to report suspicious transactions to the Treasury Department to fight organized crime.  This was held to be Constitutional in California Bankers Association vs. Shultz.<p>2.  Carter signed FISA, in a bid to <i>contain</i> Nixon-era domestic wiretapping.  Under Carter you also see the rise of FBI Swat teams and expansion from there to local police forces.<p>3.  Reagan asks for and gets a drug exception to Posse Comitatus, allowing the military to be directly involved in enforcing domestic narcotics law.  Reagan also expands on Carter&#x27;s SWAT programs by forming the outright military arm of the FBI known as the Hostage Rescue Team (involved in both Waco and Ruby Ridge, working aside the military in both cases under the drug exception to Posse Comitatus).<p>4.  Clinton asks for and gets the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which provides for most of what was in the USAPATRIOT Act.  Clinton Asks for the rest and a bill written by Biden fails to pass.  Clinton also asked for a terrorism exception to Posse Comitatus and this also failed to pass Congress.<p>5.  Bush, in the wake of 9/11, signs the USAPATRIOT Act into law, and embarks on Nixonesque wiretapping of Americans.  Seeks to hold Americans without trial.<p>6.  Obama sucedes in getting the Bush-era wiretaps legalized, and argues that Americans suspected of being in terrorist organizations can be killed anywhere in the world without trial.<p>The point is that 9/11 was not a tipping point.

5843810,comment,5843352,5843550,3,0,zaroth,,,"I think this article shows exactly how two-faced the denials made by FB and Google really are. The NYT is talking about PRISM here, which is implemented via FISA.<p>While it&#x27;s possible that NSA does not have &quot;completely unfettered&quot; access to all Google/Facebook/Microsoft databases, it&#x27;s obvious that they have direct access to a system which provides real-time data. For example in the case of monitoring Skype conversations (voice, video, data), email, and web searches, of a previously identified target. Yes, they sign off at the start, and then they let the system RUN.<p>Of course data is sent &quot;automatically&quot; and &quot;in bulk&quot; but by themselves these words mean little to nothing. I think the question is do they even bother identifying foci for the search? For Verizon &quot;meta-data&quot; they didn&#x27;t bother, they just suck it all up. Note well, that URLs are considered &quot;meta-data&quot;, even though in most cases they fully describe the content. Note well, GPS location of your phone is &quot;meta-data&quot;.<p>A true and honest debate about whether we want to live under this type of &quot;total surveillance&quot; would require a <i>lot</i> of education for the average American to understand what these systems are truly capable of. Senators Wyden and Udell have been whispering warnings for years, but even they are gagged by FISA. It&#x27;s so insulting to hear Obama claim he welcomes debate on the subject, while he continues to obfuscate the true scope of the surveillance.<p>If the PRISM slides are accurate about the &quot;2 degrees of separation&quot; then even targeting an individual at the start is meaningless. 2 degrees of separation along what axis? You think it&#x27;s just 2 degrees of &quot;sent mail&quot;?  There are spooks who do nothing but think about this shit all day long... &quot;Two degrees of separation&quot; could mean the warrant automatically broadens itself up to 2 hops from the foci, based on any &quot;contact&quot; along:<p>- Outgoing / Incoming email<p>- Facebook, Skype, Google Groups, contact lists<p>- IRC channel members<p>- Common web searches<p>- Common URLs visited<p>- Common brick & mortor shops visited<p>You can taint a LOT of people with only 2 degrees of separation if you starting thinking along multiple dimensions of contact.<p>It&#x27;s specifically this &quot;social network&quot; which the FBI is interested in.

However, people who believe homosexuality and gay marriage is wrong tend to also believe that it somehow <i>does</i> affect them in an indirect way - that it means fewer children will be raised in a good home, or that it contributes to a decline in civilized society or something. Remember that we also regulate other things that affect us in indirect ways, eg. hard drug use and sales, prostitution, etc. so it is not out of the question to regulate a choice that has indirect negative effects on society. Now we could (and I have) argued with such people until the cows came home about whether or not this is truly the case, but if we establish that it is <i>not</i> a choice, we can sidestep this argument entirely.<p>Because if it&#x27;s <i>not</i> a choice, it&#x27;s a physical trait, like race or height. And we have established pretty well as a nation that we definitely <i>cannot</i> legally regulate people&#x27;s behavior based on their physical traits, even if it <i>does</i> affect us. For example, think of the Americans with Disabilities Act - having to put in wheelchair ramps directly affects the owner of the building negatively (she has to pay for the ramps). However, we don&#x27;t question this law because being physically disabled isn&#x27;t a choice.<p>TL;DR I agree with you that even if it were a choice, it is not one that affects me and therefore cannot be regulated. But if we can get more people to understand that it is <i>not</i> a choice, we can skip the entire debate about whether or not it&#x27;s a choice that affects others and just treat each other equally under the law.",1370665137

 CL-PPCRE is a portable regular expression library for Common Lisp which has the following features: 
It is compatible with Perl. 
It is pretty fast. 
It is portable between ANSI-compliant Common Lisp implementations. 
It is thread-safe. 
In addition to specifying regular expressions as strings like in Perl you can also use S-expressions. 
It comes with a BSD-style license so you can basically do with it whatever you want. 
 CL-PPCRE has been used successfully in various applications like BioBike, clutu, LoGS, CafeSpot, Eboy, or The Regex Coach.<p><a href=""http://weitz.de/cl-ppcre"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weitz.de/cl-ppcre</a>",1370664339

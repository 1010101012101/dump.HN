Alternatively, if you have content you want to remove HTML from before displaying, don't generate rich DOM nodes for that content, immediately stick it into a TextNode and insert <i>that</i> into the DOM.  Per the example in the OP, div.textContent will remove the ""first level"" of HTML, and leave what looks like tags, as the characters are unescaped.  So just display this as an actual TextNode.  It will show the <script> string in-line (I say string here, because it's not actually a tag, since it's in a TextNode), but that's actually the content the author intended by having it escaped in the input.",1349416603

When you are reading from the same location over and over again (most notable cases are linear algebra functions, filtering in signal processing), reading from DRAM is going to be costly. This is solved on the CPUs by having multiple layers of caches.<p>Early generation of NVIDIA gpus did not an automatic Caching mechanism or could not for CUDA, I forget) that could help solve this issue. But they did have memory available locally on each compute unit where you could manually read / write data into. This helped reduce the overall read/write overhead.<p>Even when the newer generations have the caches, it is beneficial to use this shared / local memory. Even when the shared / local memory limits are hit, there are alternatives like Textures in CUDA, Images in OpenCL that are slightly slower, but significantly better than reading from DRAM.",1349416526

4615794,comment,4615602,4615602,99,0,kevinalexbrown,,,"Here's my shot at ""the most revealing job interview question"" (not looking for a job, I do neuroscience in a separate area):<p>The review explains why the rapid action of ketamine excites so many researchers:<p><i>The discovery that ketamine rapidly increases the number and function of synaptic connections has focused attention on synaptogenesis as a fundamental process for the treatment of depressive symptoms and also suggests that disruption of synaptogenesis and loss of connections underlies the pathophysiology of depression.</i><p>This excites researchers not because ketamine itself would be used to combat depression, but because depression is still extremely symptomatically defined, making it difficult to design treatments for. That's roughly how it's diagnosed in the diagnostic manual used by most psychiatrists: check off a list of symptoms, if you have enough, you're depressed. It's like going to the doctor and explaining that your stomach hurts and they say ""well, looks like you have abdominal pain, here's some Advil."" Treating the symptoms would be great if only there were a happiness dial in the brain. Indeed, the effect of most anti-depressants is often demonstrated prior to a mechanistic understanding of <i>why</i> they make many patients feel better.<p>Recently there has been substantial evidence of ""synaptogenesis"" - the formation of new potential connections between neurons - from multiple treatments, including ketamine. So now we have this new picture emerging: depressed patients tend to have atrophied and ""less-connected"" neurons in some brain areas, and some drugs can reverse it, in particular ketamine can reverse it quite rapidly, and it works in rodents as well as humans.<p>That makes it very amenable to study. The way this often works in the lab is the following. Take some rodents, subject them to unpredictable stress to get them depressed, then give some ketamine. It makes them better. Euthanize the rodents, slice the brains, and note that the non-ketamine ones have less dendritic spines in certain areas (""potential input points to a neuron""), but remarkably, the ketamine ones have more in those areas.<p>The most important step comes next, where you try to find out what ketamine is actually doing, since, again, there's no happiness dial in the brain. Create strains of ""knock-out"" rodents, where you block the production of certain chemicals or proteins you think ketamine might affect by altering their genetic composition. This step is crucial, because it allows you to find out <i>which</i> effect of ketamine is providing the benefit, because there are many. You can do this both by observing both behavior (does the ketamine not improve mood in the genetically altered rodents?) and in physiology (does the ketamine still increase synaptogenesis in the altered rodents?).<p>In the end you can kind of work out a map of sorts: ketamine does X things to the brain and Y in X are the ones that are important, sometimes in certain combinations. Then you can start creating intelligent drugs that pinpoint those important processes, to avoid the unfortunate side effects of drugs like ketamine. Moreover, you now have a better <i>physiological</i> understanding of depression, instead of just a symptomatic one.<p>To put it in machine-learning language, it's like going from ideal observer analysis like mutual information, to an actual parametric model where you understand the distributions themselves.",1349415273

4615750,comment,4615602,4615602,11,0,starpilot,,,"> In their research, Duman and others show that in a series of steps ketamine triggers release of neurotransmitter glutamate, which in turn stimulates growth of synapses.   Research at Yale has shown that damage of these synaptic connections caused by chronic stress is rapidly reversed by a single dose of ketamine.<p>There's burgeoning evidence that depression is tied to a lack of neurogenesis (creation of new brain cells), which may also be tied to serotonin levels. Some believe that the reason SSRIs take weeks to have antidepressive effects, even though serotonin levels are restored almost immediately, is that it takes a while for that to stimulate new brain cells. It's far from certain though that serotonin has anything to do with depression or neurogenesis. The atypical antidepressant tianeptine (currently unapproved in the US, but widely used in western europe) apparently reduces serotonin levels while boosting neurogenesis, the study of which is summarized well by Stanford neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky [1]:<p>>  tianeptine prevented many of these stress-induced changes. These included the spectroscopic alterations, the inhibition of cell proliferation, and a significant increase in hippocampal volume (as compared with stress + vehicle animals). Of significance (see below), tianeptine did not prevent the stress-induced rise in cortisol levels.<p>The restoration of hippocampal volume is important because it's been shown that low hippocampal volumes correlate with emotional abuse in adolescents [2] (also by Yale researchers). This was breathtaking for me - bad parenting literally causes brain damage.<p>Special K and tianeptine aren't the only efforts at curing depression through neurogenesis. Neuralstem [3] is testing a drug in humans to treat major depressive disorder by restoring hippocampal volume, with a controlled study to complete early next year. That is the only new drug I'm aware of. Regardless, the serotonin model of depression, the one which produced Prozac etc. isn't the last word, and it's looking more likely that a dearth of new synapses may be the culprit in clinical depression.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC60045/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC60045/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.medpagetoday.com/Pediatrics/DomesticViolence/30029"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medpagetoday.com/Pediatrics/DomesticViolence/3002...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.neuralstem.com/pharmaceuticals-for-depression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neuralstem.com/pharmaceuticals-for-depression</a>",1349413698

It&#x27;s also obviously part of the thought process while developing anyway, so I don&#x27;t see the same value in this as you do. There&#x27;s a cost to having a full IDE anyway and it&#x27;s more sensible to get the features you do want (auto-completion, etc.) from plugins and then not using a IDE.<p>Even if you want these things, there are better ways to go about this instead of making a whole gargantuan interface to get a couple of features.<p>I&#x27;m not usually one to tell people what they should be working on, but time could be spent on this instead:<p><a href=""https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode/wiki</a><p>(See also this for how to get in-source error information and type checking, if needed:<p><a href=""https://wiki.haskell.org/Emacs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.haskell.org/Emacs</a>)",1440575871

But that is discussed already enough in the threads here. So I want to add a new point.<p>Should she trust such a contract and its maker? I think even if you are a little brain damanged and unable to read you should have some basic ability to determine if you can trust someone. I mean he came to her home and gave her food. That basically screams &quot;I want to F<i></i>* you&quot; in one way or another. And when next he introduces some opportunity you can know exactly that this is where he&#x27;s trying to cheat you. It&#x27;s basic survival knowledge to recognize that. If you are a young white man, you might not have experienced such kind of situation before, but this structure of getting tricked is very common and not too hard to recognize, no matter where you go or what the trick is. After getting cheated a few times you recognize it as easy as a red light on the other side of the street that stops you from crossing over. If that girl doesn&#x27;t have that much brain capacity she can&#x27;t live alone. And if she has she certainly must learn to recognize that.",1440575805

10121681,comment,10118109,10120571,0,0,Dn_Ab,,,"Time reversibility exists in quantum mechanics because observables are self adjoint operators. Closed systems evolve unitarily. In simpler terms, you can think of it as the requirement that maps preserve distances and are easily invertible. We need this so that the information describing a system (which we can still talk about in terms of traces), remains invariant with time.  In the classical sense, the corresponding violation leads to probabilities not summing to 1! We clearly can&#x27;t have information shrink and for pure systems, dropping distance preserving maps leads to a really awesome universe (I believe this also ends up highly recommending L2). We literally go from a universe that is almost certainly near the bottom end of the Slow Zone of Thought to the Upper Beyond (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep#Setting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep#Setting</a>).

I can fit upwards of 50 tabs in a window before I have to scroll the tab list. This is great for managing big research or documentation sessions without the squinting in Chrome. The APIs necessary for tree tabs are not yet in chrome, although there is some discussion now of a sidebar API.<p>2. Vimperator: this extension provides a very powerful vim-like interface, including a .vimperatorrc file. I don&#x27;t use any more of the advanced features like that, but it is excellent for keeping my hands totally on the keyboard as I switch between Tmux splits, vim windows, and my browser. There are several vimperator-inspired plugins for chrome, some of which are passable. However, vimperator is a lot faster than Vimium, and the interface is more concise and vim-like. A big difference is the UI for opening links: in Vimperator, you press `f` to enter follow-link command mode. Each link is assigned a number by page order; you filter links by typing letters, and can follow the first link by pressing `enter`. So to submit this text form, I would press `esc` to return to normal mode from edit mode, then press `f`, and then type &quot;rep<enter>&quot; to filter links to reply, and then click it. It&#x27;s rather natural, and easy to click the right link.<p>In  Vimium, each link is assigned two letters (which are easier to type than numvers), but you can&#x27;t filter links. There&#x27;s a lot more squinting at the little labels to type the right thing. Plus, it&#x27;s easy to fat finger the link text with no recourse.",1440573168

He seems to regularly admit that he didn&#x27;t expect to be leading (in his bizarre Trump-speech style). If that&#x27;s the case, then initially he was in it just to stir the pot, and for the free publicity.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t believe half his positions are real. I&#x27;m pretty sure the anti-immigration / wall building positions were mostly to fire up the excitable wing of the Republican party, to charge up an emotional issue. It instantly shot him into the spotlight, because many of the other candidates were trying to avoid offending latino voters and or trying to acquire their votes. He was a Democrat for a long time, and was pro-choice for a long time, then magically completely switches positions. I&#x27;m skeptical, I think it&#x27;s far more likely he&#x27;s happy to pretend to hold various positions as convenient. No different than Hillary and Obama switching positions on gay marriage when it was ideal to do so.<p>I think if it came down to it, and Trump couldn&#x27;t be President, he&#x27;d much rather be back running his businesses, or on TV somewhere. Perhaps doing a new variation of his show. Anything else not only takes him out of his element, but would be stressful and time consuming with little upside (in regards to what Trump seems to usually wants: money, brand building, publicity).",1440572783

10121513,comment,10121089,10121089,0,0,bad_user,,,"As disclaimer, I&#x27;ve been a Scala zealot for the last 3 years. On Clojure vs Scala, usually comparisons are kind of unfair I think. As somebody interested in FP, I tried Clojure first. And FP being all about immutable data-structures, pure functions operating on immutable data-structures and dealing with side-effects explicitly by means of abstractions such as the I/O Monad, I expected to see that in Clojure, seeing how people describe it as being very FP.<p>And it was like a big WTF for me seeing how for example everything in Clojure is a Var that can be changed. And eventually I got it, I mean Clojure is a LISP and it&#x27;s meant to be compiled by a REPL and the unit of compilation is not a file and this is in LISP&#x27;s tradition and so on and so forth. But it&#x27;s still a WTF given its usual characterization. Even in Java classes are completely immutable (until you start manipulating bytecode of course) and you&#x27;ve got &quot;final&quot; declarations. You have no &quot;final&quot; in Clojure. And this is actually a pity because it (probably) means that those persistent data-structures can&#x27;t be implemented in Clojure, as &quot;final&quot; on top of the JVM comes with a pretty cool contract in the Java Memory Model that you need. And then instead of Scala&#x27;s implicit parameters, that are actually very explicit and type-checked by the compiler, in Clojure you have package-wide vars or refs that people manipulate as a poor man&#x27;s dependency injection mechanism. And state changes are usually done by mutating atoms. Well that&#x27;s cool, in Scala people also do that, but in Scala you also have a mature implementation of the I/O monad and monad transformers if you want it, or various FRP libraries. And I&#x27;m sure that Clojure has plenty of libraries, but overall I feel that in Scala the ecosystem of design patterns <i>borrowed-from-Haskell</i> is more mature.<p>Scala provides mutable variants of its data-structures in the standard library. But that&#x27;s not extra rope to hang yourself, because in Clojure the use cases still exist and people end up using Java&#x27;s mutable data-structures instead. In Scala the blend of OOP and FP can sound overwhelming, but it&#x27;s actually the healthiest blend of FP + OOP to ever come up in a programming language. And in Clojure, just because you can&#x27;t declare a class, that doesn&#x27;t mean that OOP doesn&#x27;t exist. It does and the blend is not healthy. This is why &quot;reify&quot; and &quot;proxy&quot; exist and are used quite frequently. And things like clojure.lang.ISeq are a Java OOP interface and not a protocol. Basically Scala is trying to make the best of OOP, whereas Clojure considers it a necessary evil of the host platform that it can&#x27;t get rid of. Pick your poison.",1440572650

Great, configure JUL then.<p>I took a totally baroque project setup (they just don&#x27;t know WTH they&#x27;re doing) with some JUL and some log4j, piped everything into SLF via the bridges, then configured a log4j backend (which I&#x27;m confortable with) and now I&#x27;m the only person in the project that actually has control over their logging and configures it to log into nicely separated files for application output, SQL statements and so on :-)<p>In an ideal world we&#x27;d all just use one log system, but Sun screwed that when they created the very unnecessary JUL back in the day.

In short if you have a special talent or skill it shouldn&#x27;t give you any social leverage. I don&#x27;t disagree with that but I will tell you one thing. The world will never, and I mean never ever &quot;work&quot; like that short of the personable interactions between close friends and family.

7731247,comment,7731022,7731228,10,0,sillysaurus3,,,"Hi Paul.  Sorry, I didn&#x27;t mean to write a conspiratorial comment about Google.  I meant to call attention to the fact that every textual conversation you&#x27;ve ever had has probably been logged, and just because our legal and cultural framework presently frowns upon digging through those logs, that may not always be the case in the future.  The logs will persist even after our cultural norms change.<p>So it seems important to come up with a technological solution to the problem of how to communicate without all of it being logged.  It&#x27;s a difficult problem because it&#x27;s hard to get other people to actually use whatever you come up with.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that TextSecure&#x27;s browser plugin will take off, because if it&#x27;s as easy to use as email and as powerful as email, it could have a very tiny chance of becoming the next popular communications platform. At that point no one would have to trust any company to preserve privacy, which seems valuable.<p>EDIT:  I&#x27;m confused why my comments were moved to the bottom of this thread, because they don&#x27;t seem offtopic.

The key difference between systemd vs the existing userspace, and Linux vs Minix, is that there&#x27;s ~50 years precedent of loosely-coupled being the winning design paradigm in the long run.  This is because a system made of loosely-coupled components allows the user to add, remove, and swap out parts independently of one another without having to drop the whole OS, thereby gaining the ability to adapt the OS to a changing set of requirements with minimal cost.  Tightly-coupled systems do not have this advantage, and it makes them brittle in the face of change.",1399869878

Hand-written letters converted way better than printed, IME (I used an online service to get them written, since my handwriting is terrible).<p>One of my favorite tricks was to include something slightly heavy in the envelope (I&#x27;ve used keys and pairs of dice), with enough weight that it would be delivered as a &quot;package&quot; rather than a piece of normal mail.  This makes it stand out from the rest of their mail, it&#x27;s a practically guaranteed open. You tie it into your letter copy somehow: &quot;unlock the potential of the web&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t roll the dice with your website&quot;.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s corny, it sticks out in peoples&#x27; brains, and they&#x27;ll probably call.<p>You can get miscut keys for free at Walmart, Home Depot, etc, just ask for them. It helps if you bring a kid and say they need them for a school project (or if you can&#x27;t find a kid, the employee will most likely sell a good number of them to you for $5-$10).<p>Another tactic I&#x27;ve used with varying success is to have 3-4 fake LinkedIn accounts (grow them for a few months before you start), and then when you have some cold leads (you should be connected to them via your real account), start using the accounts to tell people they really need to upgrade their website (one every few days or so). Roughly a week after the last message, hit up the lead with your real account and let them know that you&#x27;re running a special deal on a full website redesign, and that you&#x27;re starting out with your LinkedIn network since there&#x27;s limited availability.  This one netted me 4 contracts in a month a little over a year ago, with maybe a total 15 hours of work (creating and growing the accounts was the most time-consuming part, and I still have them if I ever wanted to repeat it).<p>Finally, one sales tactic that I&#x27;ve always wanted to use (but haven&#x27;t gotten around to using yet), is to suit up and rent a Lamborghini for a few hours, and drive around town making high-pressure, high-profit deals. &quot;You could have a car like this&quot;, etc.  Who&#x27;s going to say no to a handsome guy in a sharp suit with a Lambo?

Another 10-15% are historical dramatizations or are arguably straight science rather than history (for example, &quot;The Universe&quot;).<p>The Nazi aliens and such pay the bills that keep the serious stuff on the air (although &quot;Pawn Stars&quot; gets a lot of viewers, yet actually includes a lot of serious history content, so there is hope for making money without resorting to aliens or ghosts).

He became the world expert on division.  He found that if you recoded to the redundant base -1, 0, 1 then number encodings could be found that had lots of zeros which he could optimize over and speed the division up.  There were other sequential configurations he did special things with as well.  You wouldn&#x27;t believe the amount of theory he deduced from studying the redundant encoding problem and its application.  The result was SRT division.  He was the R and I can&#x27;t remember who S and T were.<p>SRT division was implemented in the Illiac II.",1399867321

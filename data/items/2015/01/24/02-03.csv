Then, build the core fan community, yourself elsewhere to the extent that the core community continues to support you knowing why they support you there and don&#x27;t primarily support you via your &quot;brand-building&quot; channels.<p>Cheap/free distribution for indies via various corporate entities is something that didn&#x27;t exist as it does 10 or 20 years ago. This is the unstoppable future. Get ahead of it vs twisting, with angst, in its wake.<p>Previously, artists bowed down to record labels. The new &quot;labels&quot; were bound to fill the digital void. She, and other artists, can carve a better direct-to-fan relationship in other mediums by using broad spectrum as a funnel into the core fan community.<p>Then there will be niche services that grow to help cultivate that fan+ model and someone in there will dominate or be swallowed by the behemoths.

8938659,comment,8932950,8937191,0,0,stolio,,,"> It is expensive to drive for a living - so expensive, in fact, that it was not a living until monopoly pricing was forced by government regulation.<p>This was done in exchange for stability in price, stability of service and other benefits i.e. we&#x27;re getting something for our money.<p>> The excess capacity of vehicles owned for personal transportation is huge. I don&#x27;t want to repeat myself, so I&#x27;ll link to another thread discussing Uber (and friends) where I participated that makes my position very clear[0].<p>I glanced through it, I don&#x27;t find the argument convincing.<p>> They are providing significant competition in an industry which has seen consumer-harming regulation for a century.<p>#1 Is it consumer-harming?  #2 if it is, does it harm consumers more than it benefits society at large?<p>The medallion system has limited the number of cabs on the road which minimizes the pollution and congestion they cause, it also makes sure they pay their fair share for things like road repairs since they&#x27;re using a public good for commercial use.  Because the cars are generally awful shades of yellow or orange pedestrians, cyclists and other cars are safer as well.  These are things that benefit society as a whole.<p>Believe it or not, many people like to know ahead of time how much a cab ride is going to cost so they can plan accordingly.<p>At the end of the day Uber is going to regulate the market using their market power to whatever extent they can.  They simply aren&#x27;t going to bring an efficient, competitive market place where everybody wins.  You don&#x27;t get valued at $40 billion when all you have are easily substituted assets (it&#x27;s an app, a brand, and some logistic management software) unless you have a long term angle of somehow making massive profits which according to basic economics <i>are assumed to be impossible in healthy markets.</i>",1422068199

Some systems will require large &quot;seeds&quot; to boot up depending on how advanced we are at a particular point and how long can we wait for booting. Then as soon as it boots it will start receiving updates on how to improve itself, otherwise it would be terribly outdated by the time it starts exporting computing. What we choose to colonize will probably depend on the specifics of the system, like solar power output, material availability at planets, etc. There&#x27;s a question on what kind of information the seeds will produce too: improving themselves should be largely redundant with the improvements made by the colonizers, which would be streamed to the new planets.

If Lyft and Uber talk to each other about gutting prices to put cabs out of business it&#x27;s illegal.  If they read the same econ books and independently come to the conclusion that it&#x27;s the best thing to do, it&#x27;s legal.<p>We regulate the cab industry to insulate it from this type of thing, because once the high prices and bad service that come with market concentration happen it may be months or longer before better options become available.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_pricing</a>",1422065101

What started off as a good thing (a contrast to consumerism and receiving whole products and whole systems from others, as other commenters have suggested) has been raised in value far beyond the worth of anyone who does not &quot;produce&quot; &quot;tangible&quot; &quot;things&quot;...<p>...the author being an excellent example, what with her being &quot;only&quot; a professor of engineering. She is &quot;building&quot; generations of makers, an activity valuable in its own right, and yet others feel the need to somehow tag her as a &quot;maker&quot;, a label she rejects, in order to somehow validate her work.<p>The broader point is that we do a poor job of recognizing the inherent value in many roles - not financial, necessarily, though we fetishize that as well - and that we therefore run the risk of distracting worthy occupants of those roles with our &quot;only one way to contribute&quot; dogma.",1422065087

By far the majority of SE jobs in these places are in IT departments writing line of business software. These are Java and .Net shops usually and anecdotally it seems they pay from $60-90k.<p>The companies where engineers are profit centers -- web startups and software companies, etc -- are desirable and attractive. Importantly, these are usually high margin businesses. In competitive markets, these companies meet engineer scarcity with attractive pay and equity packages. In places like Chicago, for every opening at 37 Signals you have 5 applicants from places like Crate & Barrel.<p>This is unfortunate especially because even here in SF I think engineers are not yet paid what they are worth. I reach this conclusion by looking at the margins of software companies and profitable internet companies. You can clearly see the value software engineers are creating.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m sure there are thousands of highly paid software engineers in the greater Chicago area. it&#x27;s a very big city and there is a lot of money there. Hell there may be thousands of highly paid engineers in finance alone. Chicago is certainly the heart of trading in this country. I&#x27;m generalizing.",1422065043

My hours were highly irregular - the shortest day I worked involved getting in at 4:30, out at 7:30 (to be fair, I was stuck at the DMV) and the longest involved getting in around 10:00 AM and out at 2:00 AM the next morning.  Average was probably about 10:45 - 7:30, sometimes time-shifted to be more like 1:30 - 10:00.  8-9 hour days were fairly typical, and it was only at crunch times that it would go up to 14 hour days and weekends.<p>My role was also one that was pretty amenable to sprints of intensive working followed by periods of rest.  I did a bunch of prototyping and working on high-profile, tight-deadline projects, and there was naturally a bunch of downtime in between them.",1422064961

You are being part of the problem here. HN can only maintain the kind of relationship with commenters and posters that you talk about if as someone in the tech industry, you don&#x27;t attack your competitors. Doing so brings you to the same standing as the kinds of people commenting that you say are ruining the site.<p>I&#x27;ve seen you post several times all in regards to this CoreOS stuff and NONE of it has been constructive. I think you need to take a step back and understand that HN is a public facing site and that the things you say here have a very real impact on how people view you and your product. Essentially you are harming your company by posting things like this.<p>Take CoreOS going their separate way as a teachable moment rather than an attack on you (even if behind the scenes it was?) and learn from it. Move on and build a great product by seeing your weak points from your competitors and learning, not by posting bile that you so willingly claim against others. If what you are building is as amazing as you want other people to believe; show them through your actions and by building an amazing piece of software. There&#x27;s plenty of room for competition in a quickly emerging market. Essentially, if you can&#x27;t say anything good then you are only harming yourself.",1422064954

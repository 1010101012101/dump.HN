Silicon Valley -- it can actually be a plus even if it folded.  In other places, nobody wants to touch you if you've had a failed venture.<p>Ironically, without a diploma, your best options for getting a job at someone else's company happen to be in the same locations that are best for starting your <i>own</i> company regardless of diploma.  Google probably won't hire you but another startup will, because <i>they</i> don't have diplomas, either!  They just care if you are smart, <i>and get things done</i>.",1209243374

A better example might be something like Second Life - there is no way that could have evolved the way most open source software evolves now.<p>Some things just require immense dedication and concentration from a large amount of people from the very start - and in an open source project, you can't get that until you have a sizable project already done.",1209242067

Ohh well it won't cost me a job.<p>I wonder if people not working on open source games has anything to do with it costing money to eat.  (For you open source folks, money is a closed source system the mean government forces us to use so they can lock the entire population into one way of doing things.  People with healthy self esteem feel comfortable charging a fair bit of it for their skills.  Heard of it?)<p>But since you brought it up.  I played quake what, 8, ten years ago.",1209241263

For me getting a better life meant going surfing as much as possible.<p>I can't imagine throwing everything for my startup, I already left behind my friend, familly and my ex-girlfriend, I won't kill my way of living standard too. I suppose it is legitimate for other people to seek a place on other criteria like where I find VCs or other people like me or mountain, or night clubs etc. and do their venture for a living.",1209240386

However, those who make it out will be better swimmers than those who stay in the kiddie pool, that's all.<p>> but I think most of those billionaires would have been as successful or even more so if they'd have spent the time to finish school.<p>Dropping out can be a necessary condition due to timing reasons alone.  Gates dropped out of Harvard because he was worried about missing his chance to make it big in the computer industry.  There's also the non-trivial issue of losing your most energetic years as a young adult (18-22) by spending them on something other than your life ambition.  Not to mention, if you aren't interested in college and <i>force</i> yourself to do it, that may well have such a spirit-crushing/soul-numbing effect that you kill off your own motivation to the point where you lose your drive to DO your own company.  It depends on your personality.<p>I think for the most part, ambition to take over the world as an entrepreneur is incompatible with jumping through <i>anyone</i> else's hoops, including sitting in class and doing what someone else tells you.<p>So it's not that dropping out makes you a world-changer, but staying <i>in</i> is frustrating to the ambitions of world-changers.<p>If you look at the Forbes 2007 list of richest Americans who didn't inherit their wealth, you get 1. Gates (college dropout), 3. Adelson (college dropout), 4. Ellison (college dropout), 5 and 6. Brin and Page (grad school dropouts), 7. Kerkorian (8th grade dropout!), 8. Dell (college dropout), 9. Allen (college dropout).  Only Warren Buffet at #2 didn't drop out of school at some level, but he was already established in business before he went to college, and only went because his father pressured him into it.  He hated it.  (I left out the Koches because they inherited Koch Industries.)<p>The causal effect is that the same thing that drives them to be successful also drove them to drop out.",1209240315

After all, you said it yourself: x86 is really RISC at its core anyway.<p>The ""economies of scale"" argument has nothing to do with the technical merits of the chip design, it has everything to do with the fact that every PC save PPC Macs has used an x86 chip for decades.<p>Architecturally, x86 does have disadvantages.  It's been designed over the years to maintain backwards compatibility -- meaning it's still living with mistakes that were made decades ago.  There are a lot of reasons why its unlikely that Apple will start manufacturing custom chips to run OS X, but none of them are because x86 is a great chip design, or that it would be impossible to design a custom chip that would run OS X well.",1209240023

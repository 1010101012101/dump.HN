When the Nexus One came out, it had an 800x480 display which was higher than most devices at the time, it had a 1GHz processor which was considerably faster than competitors, a 5 megapixel camera, 512MB RAM, etc.  This new Nexus S doesn't seem to improve on that formula much: same processor speed, RAM, megapixel camera, screen resolution.<p>Plus, I think there are more compelling options for T-Mobile right now.  Both the myTouch 4G and HTC G2 have HSPA+ allowing for much faster speeds than the HSPA that the Nexus S will come with.  Plus, I feel that the 2-color-per-pixel model that Samsung is following with its AMOLED displays makes the devices a lot less useful for my primary purpose: text.  AMOLED displays don't have the smooth text that is available on all non-AMOLED 800x480 class devices.<p>The Nexus One was a big leap forward.  It doubled the specs we were used to seeing on processor and RAM, was higher-res than anything except the Motorola Droid, and it included a top-notch camera for the time.  The new Nexus S seems like it's playing catchup and is, in fact, not as nice as competing devices.<p>Now, not having to deal with (Samsung|Motorola|HTC|LG) for OS updates and not having their or (Verizon|AT&T|Sprint|T-Mobile)'s crapware installed on it would be really nice.  I guess (for me) I'd just rather get a device that supported HSPA+, had a 3-color-per-pixel display, more RAM (the myTouch 4G has 768MB), etc.  The hardware isn't severely lacking in any way, it's just the type of hardware that was average for a phone coming out in July of this year.",1291653518

How many of these [US based] hosting providers would agree to a contract with wikileaks given that distributing classified US documents on US servers by a US business is likely a crime?<p>I'd expect very few. At the very maximum, something like 1 in 10. But we're not calling for boycotts of rackspace, right?

That's because when say Alice brings up a better way/library/tool, she's acting as a layer of abstraction.<p>You don't immediately get to see the internal processing Alice is doing to decide which library to use and why it is the best choice for your specific task.  All you see is her output: ""here's what you use in this situation"". This isn't about knowing trivial details of libraries.  It isn't about rote learning.  It is the practical application of knowledge borne out of experience.<p>That experience is what is being rewarded, not the memorization.  How to tell the difference? The best developers come with introspection tools: they are able and very willing to explain the reasoning behind their recommendations in detail.",1287428384

You only have a few moments to really capture someone's attention these days and you have to use every gun in your arsenal. Techies (like myself) tend to downplay or outright denigrate marketing and sales tactics, but there is a lot of truth to them that we would do well to follow.

1804629,comment,1802876,1804243,0,0,lsc,,,"right.  but the old internet... the way it used to be was that there was no real difference between a ""client"" and a ""server"" - an IP address was an IP address.  Yeah, for most people, the Internet is the web, and that's enough.  And nat works great for that.<p>The problem with enforcing this idea (that you have ""clients"" with private addresses behind a NAT and ""servers"" with public addresses)  is that this won't be able to change.   Doing peer to peer gaming, filesharing, video chat, etc... through multi-later (or carrier) nat is very difficult.   It works through our home NATs right now, well, sortof, because there is one public IP for 2 or 3 computers.   Upnp  and other tricks can usually handle getting through a single layer nat with only a few private IPs behind it.  If your ISP owns the nat and has hundreds of people behind the same v4 public IP, or in a double layer nat, where the ISP gives you a private IP behind a nat (that obviously doesn't support Upnp) suddenly this is going to work a lot less well.<p>Now, you can solve the problem by just making everything client-server.   Want to video chat or game?  each person needs to connect to a server with a public IP and talk through that server.   It's doable, but it means that the Internet the next generation grows up with will be a different sort of network than the Internet I grew up with.  This network will be one where you are either a ""server"" or a ""consumer""<p>Some people say we've been moving in this direction for a long time, but this doesn't make it any less sad.<p>(also note... it's not just nerds that get screwed... if anything, gamers will get screwed more than nerds.  Nerds can get VPSs that work just fine for most anything a nerd would want to do.   VPSs, generally speaking, make shitty game servers, though.)",1287427904

Mobile Google has turned <i>Trivial Pursuit</i> into a typing competition.<p>I'd also question the use of the phrase <i>modern culture</i> here. In nonliterate cultures memorizing facts didn't just pass for smart, it <i>was</i> smart: An unmemorized fact was an unrecorded fact.

We used an invite only system to introduce artificial scarcity and drive buzz on Twitter (each new signup got five invites to use). After six months we launched to the public and started charging for private repos. Because we had such a great beta period, we converted a large number of users that day and were making money immediately! For the next several months we put every dollar that we made into the company bank account and let it accrue.<p>One year after inception I was faced with a choice: take a full time position at Microsoft (Powerset had been acquired) or quit and go full time at GitHub. We were making enough money at GitHub to pay low salaries for the three cofounders and we decided to Hire Scott Chacon at the same time. So we went from zero to four full time salaries in one day, a year after starting it on the side.<p>Over the next six months we incrementally raised salaries for everyone as we hit specific revenue goals. So about 18 months after inception we were making decent salaries. We also hired Tekkub to do full time tech support in this timeframe. Our next hire was Melissa, our office manager a few months later.<p>As far as revenue at these milestones, we were always profitable. We only hired when we had the money to do so. For the first 18 months we didn't carry much balance in the bank account. We used it to hire great people.<p>Being a subscription service means that recurring revenue is extremely predictable. We've never had a month where revenue has dropped, and we can predict the increase in monthly revenue quite accurately as well. Growth has been surprisingly smooth (not spikey).<p>We now make money from GitHub.com, GitHub FI, Training, the Job Board, and merchandise.",1287427136

While there were events named ""panics"", before Quantitative Easing was even a buzzword, they oddly resemble their central banking modern day equivalents, primarily because they were/are caused by the same reason - Government meddling in/with the money supply.<p>I won't go through them all, but they faced the same problems we face today, and the same actors are the cause:<p>In the panic of 1873, lots of railroads had been financing up to the hilt with debt because you couldn't lose money building railroads (or houses, right?) and they lobbied the government for easy money policies (non-convertable notes, issuing more currency) so that the value of the greenback would drop, making their outstanding debt worth less in <i>real</i> terms.<p>Then the supreme court ruled in <i>Hepburn v. Griswold</i> in 1870 that ""Legal Tender"" (non-convertable US notes) was unconstitutional as per article 1 by a 5-3 vote. That shook up the market for the greenback, which was already trading at a heavy discount to gold dollars. But, don't worry, sure to create fear in the markets, President Grant appointed two new Republican judges (one open spot, and another spot created by a Majority member retiring post-vote), who quickly overturned that decision in <i>Knox v. Lee</i> by a 5-4 vote in May 1871.<p>Add on top of this divide between wanting Gold backed dollars vs US non-backed ""greenbacks"", the money supply doubled as new banks opened and loaned out too much. According to Murray Rothbard:<p>""The panic of 1873 was, not to initiate a great depression, but to cause bankrupt- cies in overinflated banks and in railroads riding on the tide of vast government subsidy and bank speculation.""",1287426434

There is a wealth of knowledge that exists at HN and I’m hoping some folks can steer me in the right direction with my dying startup because at this point I’m not sure what to do?<p>About three years ago, my friend and I thought up an idea for creating a ""social network for traders."" He had worked in finance for one of the biggest forex brokers and was a trader of foreign exchange.<p>A few months into his work, he realized that this company, with its millions of clients, was missing a critical component that clients constantly kept asking about ""can I communicate with other clients regarding certain positions or trends in the market?""<p>Coming from a web development/IT background, I immediately got to work on creating a small prototype of what we both envisioned to be a forum for currency traders to come and discuss their strategies, trades, tips and suggestions on choosing brokers, etc. etc.<p>The website was simple but as we put more effort into it, we realized there wasn’t any real competitor to a website that caters to an international community of traders at all.<p>We figured our ideas are on a much bigger scale and we decided to proceed further and bring our ideas to fruition. What started as a hobby and then a venture soon turned into a business.<p>Six months into it, we picked up an angel investor overseas (coincidentally, one of my buddy’s clients who was interested in such an idea). As money rolled in, web development expanded dramatically. We outsourced all the dev work to India, having two firms work around the clock, we hired mathematicians to help with formulas, and hired graphic artists. We managed teams of workers and went through countless design phases and formula tweaks.<p>The overall premise of the site expanded from a simple forum to a world wide community, where traders can interact and compete with other traders by predicting the weeks end financial markets.<p>Today, our weekly competitions, allow traders to pick from various local or world markets, and try to predict how that respective market will close. Besides forex, we include other markets such as futures, U.S. markets and world markets.<p>Each prediction is graded based on a unique scale according to our internal algorithm. The scale ""tiers"" are provided on the website in layman’s terms to make the user understand how he can earn or lose virtual dollars (which in turn, can be redeemed for real-world prizes).<p>In the short team, the momentum was flowing and we were convinced that we were on the up and up. We had enough money for development and knew what we needed to spend to get to where we wanted to be.<p>Then in 2009, our investor backed out half way into the process leaving us with no money left for marketing (we originally wanted to leave 60% for marketing and advertising).<p>Today, we still believe in our idea but ever since the money dried up, we found ourselves not being able to market the website properly and in turn leaving it stale and hope that word-of-mouth will help. Development is more or less complete and we have active users trading but the momentum is gone and in a way so is our motivation.<p>The easy answer is to say ""keep working at it"" but it is difficult especially when time is so valuable (we are in our late 20’s and life is becoming more challenging i.e. jobs, women, money, etc.).<p>What does an aspiring entrepreneur do now knowing that his idea can still work but has no motivation to continue without short-term incentives?\n---",1287426230

It is just a bit different and it looks different externally.<p><i>Lisp has a 2-stage syntax.</i><p><i>The first stage is the syntax of s-expressions</i>, which is surprisingly complex. S-Expressions provide a textual syntax for data: symbols, lists, pairs, strings, various number formats, arrays, characters, pathnames, ...<p>The first stage is implemented by the 'reader' and can be reprogrammed by an ancient API to the reader via read tables.<p><i>The second stage is the syntax of the Lisp programming language.</i> This is defined on top of s-expressions and is really a syntax over data structures (not text). This Lisp syntax deals with: data items, function calls, special forms (thirty something) and macro forms.<p>This syntax stage is implemented as part of the interpreter/compiler (EVAL, COMPILE, COMPILE-FILE) and can be extended by writing macros, symbol macros and compiler macros.\nIn earlier dialects it could also be extended by writing so-called FEXPRs, functions which get called with unevaluated source code (-> data in Lisp).<p>So, we get a lot of complex syntax due to special forms and macros. It just looks a bit different, since the data syntax is always underneath it (unless one uses a different reader).<p>For example a function definition would be:<p><pre><code>   (defun foo (a b) (+ (sin a) (sin b)))\n</code></pre>\nThe syntax for that is:<p><pre><code>    defun function-name lambda-list [[declaration* | documentation]] form*\n</code></pre>\nWith more complex syntax for 'function-name', 'lambda-list' and 'declaration'.<p>Lambda-list has this syntax:<p><pre><code>    lambda-list::= (var* \n                    [&optional {var | (var [init-form [supplied-p-parameter]])}*] \n                    [&rest var] \n                    [&key {var | ({var | (keyword-name var)}\n                      [init-form [supplied-p-parameter]])}*\n                      [&allow-other-keys]] \n                    [&aux {var | (var [init-form])}*])\n\n</code></pre>\nNot every valid Lisp program has an external representation as an s-expression - because it can be constructed internally and can contain objects which can't be read back.<p>Not every s-expression is a valid Lisp program. Actually most s-expressions are not valid Lisp programs.<p>For example<p><pre><code>   (defun foo bar)\n</code></pre>\nis not a valid Lisp program. It violates the syntax above.",1287425870

1804472,comment,1803751,1804361,0,0,Xurinos,,,"<i>For UI elements it is OO hands down.</i><p>I was thinking about this assertion on a walk, and I realized that this is just a matter of opinion.  I can see it apply if you were programming with Tk.  The same goes for Gtk, but when you add glide, the UI construction becomes declarative, and to be honest with you, I have preferred that style of UI construction over having to figure out my arrangements by pencil and paper.  I would say that for 90% of your cases, you are not writing a truly dynamic UI that requires OOP to construct things.<p>When we talk about responding to events, we respond with functions.  Presumably, we bury those functions in random placeholders, like a class dedicated to the callbacks, but they are still just functions that describe how to behave.<p>When I do web programming, I find myself with a mixed approach: HTML and CSS (declarative), javascript with jQuery (OOP and functional).<p>jQuery is an interesting use case of the blending of OOP and FP.  Consider that when you make changes to objects in jQuery, a jQuery object is returned.  Thus, you can chain things like this:<p><pre><code>   jQuery(element).action().action().action();\n\n</code></pre>\nThis is actually an improvement over typical OOP as implemented by people who do not understand the benefits of FP, and it reinforces the fact that OOP and FP are compatible, not some kind of opposing forces.<p><i>In you example I have to package up the functions</i><p>Packaging issues really have little to do with OOP.<p>Yes.  One way to do that is with a class.  Another might be a package or namespace.  Organization is a social issue.  What you described is not a strength of OOP.  In fact, the way most people I have seen do OOP is bulky because they are trying to mitigate this packaging issue: they try to put everything into one single class that is easy to share, as opposed to breaking it down to its logical parts with multiple classes.<p>Take a simple textarea widget, for example.  Let's say you want to extend it to have a spell-checking feature.  You extend the class to be TextAreaWithSpellChecking.  The typical poorly designed resulting class will include the spell-checking code as opposed to implementing spell-checking in a separate module.  It is easier to send the single class than multiple classes, right?  Where should the spell-checking live?  The answer is not about OOP or FP or other approaches/tools.  It is about how you choose to abstract and break things apart.",1287425293

The main thing seemed to be that everyone knew each other; the crew had worked together before, and the flight agent who checked their IDs knew them. I would not be surprised if the flight agent was given pictures of the pilots as well as their names, though, which would probably provide the greatest security (identity verified by a trusted third party, the airline, without any chance for the pilot to interact with the verifying document, as happens with passports or other ids. If you never get to see it, you can't tamper with it).",1287425148

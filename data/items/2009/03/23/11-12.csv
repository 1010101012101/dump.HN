528386,comment,524314,524314,0,0,daemin,,,"In some way I think you need some form of middle-like management once an organisation gets beyond a certain size. I know Joel Spolsky has mentioned it and I agree with his reasoning. (<a href=""http://www.inc.com/magazine/20080901/how-hard-could-it-be-how-i-learned-to-love-middle-managers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inc.com/magazine/20080901/how-hard-could-it-be-ho...</a>)<p>I can even see it at the startup I'm currently at. Even though the CEO/COO's door has always been ""open"", it's been harder and harder to enter it as the size of the company has increased. It's not a physical barrier, although the C*O's are busier now, but a psychological one in most cases, where once is (I don't want to say it but) afraid or cautious in disturbing the busy individual.<p>That being said the quality of the person being the manager is probably the most important detail. I can see that in the company I'm in. In the group I'm in we have a really good manager, one that's able to gather our grievances and ideas and present them to the higher ups. While the other group has a pretty lack lustre manager. The difference in morale, job satisfaction, and employee retention are striking. But none of these managers have an MBA.",1237808806

So all one needs is the GreaseMonkey platform to act as a holder, and existing GM scripts can run straight off, without modification.

Every building contractor in New York knows you request bids from five or ten plumbers before you award the contract. If a plumber said, ""I'll do it for $x, but if you shop around, deal's off,"" the contractor would laugh his head off and throw the plumber out on the street. Nothing sends a stronger message that an offer is uncompetitive than refusing to expose it to competition. And that's for a $6000 kitchen installation. Getting $10 million in funding for a business is the biggest and most important deal in the life of a company.</i><p>(<a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/VC.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/VC.html</a>)",1237806466

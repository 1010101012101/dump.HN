It&#x27;s income to them they receive without working, it should be taxed higher because those who work for their money should not be taxed higher than those who simply have it given to them.<p>>  I worked hard to earn those things,why would the government want 85% of their value??<p>Yes, and that&#x27;s yours, not your children&#x27;s.  The only person you can give large sums of money to tax free is your spouse; to everyone else, that&#x27;s new income and it should be taxed, and large sums should be taxed heavily because inherited wealth is anathema to democracy.<p>You can&#x27;t have a functioning democracy and allow capital accumulation to the elite in such large sums that their children become kings with the power to buy politicians and affect law without having the benefit of having worked for that money and really understanding what it means to not be wealthy.<p>> On what basis and logical reason? To make my children &quot;less lazy&quot; by doing so??<p>No, to stop them from destroying society.<p>> They can mind their own children - I will mind mine.<p>You live in a community and it&#x27;s not all about you and yours; try not thinking about yourself so much and look at the bigger picture. Inherited wealth is bad for society, earned wealth is good for society.  You earned your money, keep it; your children should earn their own on their own.",1403798356

Sometimes it may be justified, but it also very often conveniently ignore that the &quot;targeted civilians&quot; may themselves have been insurgents or terrorists or infiltrators who were legitimate targets.<p>It&#x27;s a popular excuse whether or not it is true, because assuming your attacks go well, it gets very hard to find out the truth when everyone involved has been conveniently killed.",1403798287

Maybe the copyright, maybe just a license. There&#x27;s usually something along those lines.&quot;</i><p>Publications usually allow the writer to retain IP ownership, but with an exclusive license granted to the publication for a certain period of time. For instance, &quot;Joe Writer agrees to license to PublicationMagazine the exclusive worldwide rights to the work for a period of N days.&quot; Depending on the contract, many publications will also want the right to sublicense or syndicate the work during their license period, but will compensate the writer X% of syndication revenues.<p>I&#x27;ve never written for HuffPo, and I have no idea how their process works. I do, however, think it&#x27;s a raw deal for any writer to contribute for free on an ongoing basis to a successful, for-profit publication. Not that there&#x27;s anything illegal or immoral about that, per se. It&#x27;s just that the writer is selling his time and product very short.

One thing to consider is that the biggest threat is from the &quot;omnipresent&quot; companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc, because they&#x27;re the ones who have a 3rd party presence nearly <i>everywhere</i> on the web. Tracking someone&#x27;s <i>entire</i> web history is a lot different than tracking 1 out of every 100 websites they go to, and the &quot;big players&quot; are the ones who are most likely to actually be scrutinized.

You can&#x27;t choose to stop being a slave. At any point, you can choose to stop paying taxes (either illegally or by ceasing to earn income). If you had adequate resources, you could live off of the land entirely on your own and keep all of the fruits of your labor.<p>At many lower incomes, there is no income tax bill due whatsoever. So you&#x27;re saying the government is enslaving the wealthy to a greater extent than the poor? And you honestly think that?  The government represents the will of the people, via democratic action, we set our own tax rates. So the &#x27;people&#x27; are enslaving themselves? I don&#x27;t think that makes any logical sense whatsoever.<p>Call income tax &#x27;theft&#x27; if you must (a comparison I still disagree with) but slavery doesn&#x27;t hold up and distracts the conversation.",1403795119

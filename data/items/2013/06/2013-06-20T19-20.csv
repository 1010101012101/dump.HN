Will each person will have their own little piece of the codebase that nobody else touches? If so, then why have a nightshift? Why not just have everyone work in the day, since it&#x27;s all in parallel anyway?<p>Because that way you can fit more people in the same facility? Otherwise, it will be unused for 8 hours each day (being optimistic).",1371758370

5914519,comment,5913119,5913596,1,0,thatswrong0,,,"> You would have to be astoundingly incompetent to make a socialized system more expensive for the USA.<p>Well we do spend more per capita on education than any other nation (and not have results to show for it) and education is dominated by the government. Our government is astoundingly incompetent. And I see no reason why the government would magically make healthcare cheaper just because it would get EVEN MORE involved.<p>> Pretty sure your federal government can recognize human rights, and ensure they are respected.<p>If this is what you&#x27;re referring to (in Article 25 (1)):<p>> Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.<p>Constitutionally, no. Most of this should be (but of course isn&#x27;t, given that we have Social Security, Medicaid/Medicare, TANF, etc.) left to the states. All powers not explicitly described by the Constitution are left to the states per the 10th amendment in the Bill of Rights. And personally, I would be fine with this. I would rather not have the monolithic and inscrutable federal government we have today. I would prefer to leave it to the states whether or not they want to recognize the U.N. Universal Declaration.",1371758314

I’ve never had a strong opinion on suing over inaccessible sites since I’ve never run into a public site I’ve had to use that was completely inaccessible. The issues I’ve had with accessibility have been more with software. If I was going to suggest anyone be sued at this point it would be Microsoft. While there desktop OS is accessible neither Windows Phone 7 or 8 is. I could give them a pass on 7 especially if they knew it was a stopgap measure. Windows Phone 8 shares common code with Windows 8 though. One would hope this includes accessibility API’s but Microsoft has made no statements that I can find about whether they will ever include screen reading software in Windows Phone 8 or at least provide an API so someone else can.",1371757679

We should in fact increase spending on big projects and push for the hard things that traditional short term capital doesn&#x27;t want to touch.  Things like AGI, Space Colonization, things like Sonny White&#x27;s Eagleworks, things that could transform our society in short order.  I would love it if the real dreamers like Paul March and James Woodward got sizable funding for their work on Mass Fluctuations and their work on the origin of Inertia, Eric Lerner got some money to work on Focus Fusion, Kirk Sorensen could really build and engineer his Liquid Fluoride Thorium reactors on a large scale and countless more less known scientists and visionaries got to pursue their ideas full time and with significant funding.  A well functioning Government and visionary investors if they focused on people like that could really move the ball forward for our society and the world.

I was fortunate that I grew up just as assistive technology was becoming widely available and fairly easy to use. In 1955 a translator would have to spend a lot of time learning to read and write braille. They would then have to read a print book and manually retype it in braille. Given this it’s understandable why Braille was not something that was pushed in the public school system. By the time I started school anyone with basic computer literacy could scan in a book, open the file in a translation program and print a braille copy out using a braille embosser. While this technology isn’t cheap I was fortunate enough to go to a school that could afford it as well as having parents who advocated for me.<p>I think some of the issues this person had were caused by having some vision. Because I’m totally blind it’s pretty clear that print won’t do me any good and major accommodations have to be made. When you have some vision it’s difficult for others to understand what you can and can’t do, especially if that changes as your vision gets worse.<p>I have an issue with the only 10% of legally blind people can read braille statistic because it is not made clear what the population of legally blind people consists of. Often times being blind is in addition to severe mental handicaps. If someone can’t use the bathroom on their own then learning to read books is low on the list of things that are important. In addition braille may not make sense to elderly people who recently lost their vision. If their fingers are no longer sensitive enough to read braille then should they still count in the statistic? Older people who have lost their vision also have prior experience reading print material. This means that with the prevalence of text to speech software it may not be worth learning braille if they already know how words are spelled and how to construct a sentence.",1371757265

5914374,comment,5913135,5913135,7,0,hooande,,,"Some thoughts on this:<p>1. Surprising to see an article on innovation that mentions Kickstarter only as a footnote. One of the reasons we lack innovation is because we&#x27;ve let one group of people, big name venture capital investors, to decide by themselves what&#x27;s good and what isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s important to note that the modern &quot;VC&quot; investment model had very little to do with the major innovations of the 20th century. Some of our greatest inventions came from government laboratories, people working on their own without organized investment and corporations who acted like VCs by internally funding good ideas. Modern VCs only appeared around the 80s to give us derivative works that succeeded by added branding to existing ideas. The beauty of Kickstarter et al is that we have a much larger pool of people to tell us what&#x27;s good or bad, but it does no good if we keep looking down on crowdfunding as venture capital&#x27;s weaker sibling. We need to focus more on &quot;how much good do they do&quot; than on &quot;how much money did they raise&quot;<p>2. Another reason we don&#x27;t have much innovation is because &quot;Inventor&quot; is no longer a job title. Back in the days of (my hero) Thomas Edison you didn&#x27;t need a VC firm or a trendy office to justify your intentions to make something new. You just did it, with no particular funding or social organization. People decided to dedicate their lives to the pursuit of making new and original things. Now it&#x27;s so important to be a part of the &quot;startup community&quot;, important to have social validation from big name vcs, important to never say no to any amount of money. Until people can declare themselves to be Inventors without all of the other trappings, we shouldn&#x27;t expect unbounded innovation from them.<p>3. This line struck me &quot;...one guy saying that they were going to do these crazy things like ship a phone with no keyboard running a real OS and require everyone to buy a data plan.&quot;<p>Another reason we don&#x27;t innovate any more is because minor changes to an existing product now count as the the most significant innovations of our time. I understand that we need heroes and Steve Jobs is one of them. And a lot of people like the iphone. But Thomas Edison invented recorded sound. Tesla harnessed electricity and energy beams. Freaking Ben Franklin invented the concept of a lending library. And the best our generation has is something about a phone OS and data plan?<p>We can&#x27;t expect the next generation to be true innovators when we direct all of our hero worship at people who make small improvements to existing ideas. Yes, this may mean one of your heroes too. But if we can&#x27;t even make the sacrifice of focusing on those who actually do invent new things, how can we be expected to be so creative ourselves?<p>Finally, innovation isn&#x27;t completely dead. People are working on fusion reactors, warp drives and brain interfaces. Their efforts just don&#x27;t draw as much attention of big VC investments or the work of big name entrepreneurs. The biggest things that innovation is lacking are things that our society can provide.",1371756931

Three or four glasses of 30ppm silver in water over the course of 24 hours and I quickly recovered. It is very effective in vivo for some things. Is there peer reviewed research behind this? Probably not. But after reading Ben Goldacre&#x27;s Bad Pharma, I&#x27;m of the opinion that my anecdote carries as much weight as the industry&#x27;s research.",1371756602

5914257,comment,5911893,5914110,1,0,shawndumas,,,"it&#x27;s an understood economic principal:<p>&quot;At the end of the 19th century, economist Vilfredo Pareto discovered that wealth among a population is not normally distributed. Rather, it seemed to have the form of a power law P(k) ∼ k−γ.<p>Figure 2a shows the distribution of wealth in 2011 among the richest people in the US in a log–log plot. The distribution is quite skewed and somewhat resembles a power law. It also illustrates that the richest man in the US, Bill Gates (rightmost data point), is about 30 times richer than the average of the next 400 fabulously rich Americans. It&#x27;s natural to view such a skewed distribution of wealth as both unethical and unjust.<p>The difference between the normal distribution of length and the power-law distribution of wealth is precisely the skewness: If Bill Gates were a length, he would measure more than 300 miles from head to toe. How can the occurrence of that extraordinarily broad distribution be explained?<p>In the case of wealth, one can seek an explanation in terms of human economic actions and greed. That approach seems fine at first. But the same broad distribution was discovered early in the 20th century to represent town populations in a country (figure 2b). In the case of towns, population growth, commerce, and migration are among the factors likely to shape the distribution. Power-law distributions appear in other diverse settings and, as is the case with wealth and town size, have seemingly disparate causes.<p>Species among genera (figure 2c), which should have something to do with biological evolution.<p>Word frequency in a novel (figure 2d), which should have something to do with how you write a book or how the human language arose and developed.<p>Surnames in a country (figure 2e), which should have something to do with the country&#x27;s society and history.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.physicstoday.org/daily_edition/points_of_view/just_and_unjust_distributions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.physicstoday.org/daily_edition/points_of_view/jus...</a><p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/nov/11/occupy-movement-wealth-power-law-distribution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/nov/11/occupy-m...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_index</a>",1371755989

To say Balanced is inferior save for their Payout speed is not true. Their differences become more clear when you are operating as a marketplace.<p>It’s been stated before, and I’ll reiterate, Balanced’s merchant account underwriting for marketplaces is performed via their API.  This means the marketplace retains complete visibility into the account signup process. With Stripe Connect, you are redirected to their website, which means your potential user may or may not ever make it back to your system for whatever reason.<p>During merchant underwriting, Stripe Connect requires each merchant to create an account on their system with their own username and password. This means they are free to access their account on Stripe outside of your system. While good for the merchant, it might not be so for the marketplace trying to ensure all transactions continue to run smoothly.<p>Also, because each merchant account in Stripe Connect is separate, the marketplace does not gain any economies of scale when it comes to pooling together all credit card transactions for volume pricing purposes. Balanced has a single escrow account that all funds are held in and does offer volume pricing based upon that.<p>In my opinion, Stripe’s focus originally seemed to be on the individual merchant and have recently made changes to make them more attractive to marketplaces. However, Balanced’s approach has been to offer a more complete solution for a marketplace, while still allowing for all the same features to be used as a single merchant.",1371755845

If I plan on spending any amount of time on a website that has one, I immediately edit the css to add display: none because otherwise it&#x27;ll drive me crazy.<p>It&#x27;s a waste of space and it makes it much much harder for me to read on my laptop.

I switched to Vibrams 4-5 weeks ago and I'm enjoying some pleasing results.<p>For example, prior to using Vibrams, I could only run for 10 minutes or so before my ankles and hips started to hurt. (This was almost certainly due to poor technique as much as the ""hard strike"" cushioned by my trainers.) Now though, I'm actually enjoying running again. I can do 30-40 minutes, and it's my fitness - or lack, thereof - that makes me stop rather than joint pain.<p>I can only think that having so little cushioning on the foot forces better technique (I'm certainly aware that my running stride is now much shorter and that I'm lighter on my feet, too).<p>It took a couple of weeks to really get used to them and adjust both my walking and running strides accordingly, but now I feel as though I can run like a kid again rather than a puffing middle-aged bloke.",1287403192

Captains of ocean liners ?<p>I used to visit the US on a very regular basis, a few years ago I decided I'd had enough of the insults and the power trips these TSA types go through, I'm very happy that someone with some visibility finally has enough of it and steps up.<p>What bugs me a lot more is all the people that stand by and let it happen. That's being complicit to some extent.<p>That war on terror was won long ago. But not by who you think.",1287399811

There are actually a number of different types of paypal accounts, each with their own set of rules and features. Paypal --very intentionally-- tries to confuse people by not clearly listing both the various types of accounts and the various risks associated with them. They also very intentionally do _EVERYTHING_ they can to get your bank account credentials.<p>For example, in your situation, there may have been a somewhat hidden link to ""other payment options"" but of course, the only default you saw was ""enter your bank account number."" Paypal pulls this shit constantly, and all it takes is one wrong click (or less than careful reading) to trap you into an endless page reloads of ""please enter your bank account"" nonsense. --It's extremely scammy and they use every anti-pattern in the book, heck, they probably wrote the book.<p>I should also note, NEVER use a bank account debit card with paypal or online. These are also another way your bank account can be completely drained by attackers or less than honorable businesses.",1287399688

They are uniformed, they carry clear identification badges that can be verified easily, and they probably know half the people working in the airport. You can't expect them to be groped several times a day for no good reason just to do their jobs.",1287399664

398955,comment,398692,398692,0,0,byteCoder,,,"A new religious war is breaking out before my eyes: web apps vs. native apps on the iPhone.<p>The reality is that there are lots of native iPhone apps that should be web apps. Right now, the web apps don't quite pay as well.<p>I believe what we're ultimately seeing is the rise of the native/web hybrid application. These are a class of web-like applications that can run in disconnected mode:<p>* views use HTML/CSS stored locally on the client<p>* handling of requests from the views is done within the client itself, or dispatched externally to a web API<p>* sophisticated data structures can be persisted on the client (in mysql, text files, etc.)<p>* more sophisticated processing than typically occurs in your standard web app<p>* better access to native hardware features<p>The technologies are coming together: Adobe AIR, UIWebView/iPhone SDK, Android's WebView, etc. to support this. I'm looking forward to it.",1229381945

398936,comment,398685,398685,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"It is pretty hard for someone not deeply immersed in the particular jargon of the debate to understand what Lessig is trying to communicate in his public statements. For example, this quote from Lessig's testimony to the Senate Commerce Committee is quite ambiguous:<p>""As I testified in 2006, in my view that minimal strategy right now marries the basic principles of “Internet Freedom” first outlined by Chairman Michael Powell, and modified more recently by the FCC, to one additional requirement — a ban on discriminatory access tiering. While broadband providers should be free, in my view, to price consumer access to the Internet differently — setting a higher price, for example, for faster or greater access — they should not be free to apply discriminatory surcharges to those who make content or applications available on the Internet. As I testified, in my view, such “access tiering” risks creating a strong incentive among Internet providers to favor some companies over others; that incentive in turn tends to support business models that exploit scarcity rather than abundance. If Google, for example, knew it could buy a kind of access for its video content that iFilm couldn’t, then it could exploit its advantage to create an even greater disadvantage for its competitors; network providers in turn could deliver on that disadvantage only if the non-privileged service was inferior to the privileged service.""<p>I understand how someone could misread that statement to support the view that Lessig is opposed to tiered content-provider access. I certainly did not get the point that Lessig wanted me to get when I first read his statement.<p>That said, journalists should try to get these things straight.",1229380569

There are probably a half dozen caches involved in every request you make.

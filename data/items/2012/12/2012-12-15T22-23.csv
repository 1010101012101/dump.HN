Dare I call it ""revenge""?<p>My career started with six years in a legacy development ghetto. I started looking for work in the tail end of the dot-com crash, and the only thing I found after months of searching was a position doing Pick database development. It was a mistake to take that job, but I really wanted to get out of my parents' house. Pick developers are an interesting breed, like a cross between mainframe die-hards and ravenous DBAs. And here I was, using things like ""functions"" and ""templates"" in my code like some young thing who just wants to jump on the latest trends.<p>One shop had an middleware app that put a web-based GUI on top of the Pick database. I got called into my boss's office and told to stop putting &nbsp; in my pages because it confused the other developers. At another job, the sysadmin refused to install risky open source things like CURL or wget on the server, and Pick had sockets by then but no HTTP library, so had to write my own HTTP client in PickBASIC so we could talk to a partner's API. It was like being stuck in the 60s, only without the drugs. I was writing green-screen apps...in 2005!<p>Anyway, the point of all this is that my resume was tainted at that point. I could quote Stroustrup with my eyes closed, but nobody would bring me in for an interview for anything other than Pick because that's all my ""professional experience"" entailed. That changed when I put $1000 of my own money on the line and got Java certified.<p>My first Java job quickly morphed into a PHP job, and now I've been in that world for seven years. There's lots of cowboy coders slinging PHP, you know. Don't know if anyone's ever pointed that out on HN at all. Version control, classes, prepared queries, frameworks...I've been fighting uphill battles over those for years. Yes, prepared queries were controversial because they're ""slow""!<p>Now that my wife is out of school, I finally have the chance to go & do things my way. I'm giving freelancing a try. I set up my own Git server the other day. I do commits every time I'm done implementing a feature, and it's so damn satisfying -- almost orgasmic after nagging my co-workers for years. I develop on my laptop, not on the production server. I write clean, well-documented code. I use templates to keep HTML out of my code. I'm branching out into Ruby on Rails for a side project and probably some of my client work.<p>It's stressful as hell, but at least I'm making things I can be proud of, and the product of my work reflects well on me as a developer. I'm actually enjoying programming again.",1355612023

Like AttributedMarkdown or Slash, you define NSAttributedString text styles in code.

You just associate your styles with tag names you define, and write your text in a pseudo-XML syntax using those tags. This is good for defining tags with semantics suited to your particular domain.<p>Second, FTCoreText doesn't use UIKit's NSAttributedString attributes. It uses the more powerful CoreText NSAttributedString attributes, which have been present since iOS5 at least. They are more powerful in one important way: only the CoreText string attributes support defining tab stops.

The solution requires a server which can manage keys without being able to read them. It does reduce the strength of the system to a strong passphrase or series of passphrases (and there are ways of making the UX for this less horrible than it currently is in most places) but that's still way better than anything we have right now--it essentially reduces the attack vectors available to someone with <i>root access to the server</i> to those available to everyone on the internet for any other service right now (ie. brute force).<p>(3) I agree, no one will ever convince Google to encrypt Gmail.

The client would be able to perform deeper searches within a particular date range by decrypting messages in that range should it be necessary.<p>So yeah, the world of encrypted email already exists but it sucks. Yes, making it easier involves reducing security somewhat (not even close to ""rendering it useless"") but it also provides a level of privacy that should have been expected from the get-go. <i>Nobody should be able to run a search on every word I've written to anyone in the past ten years but me.</i> The fact that nobody outside the crypto-nerd community uses existing client-side encryption has more to do with the poor usability of existing solutions and general (changing) assumptions about the privacy of email than anything to do with police warrants.",1355611331

4926497,comment,4925974,4925974,7,0,jmillikin,,,"(disclaimer: I'm employed by Google, though not in anything related to Gmail)<p>The article quotes Vint Cerf as saying that encryption isn't being used because it would inhibit advertising, but I think that's incorrect. There is no obvious reason why ads couldn't be selected client-side, with the text of a message sent to Google over an encrypted connection and not stored.<p>In my opinion, there are at least three much more significant reasons why Gmail won't support end-to-end encryption:<p>1) It puts a huge barrier in front of new users. Instead of picking a username and password, now they have to create an encryption key, have a (strong!) password for the key, install client-side software to manage it, keep a backup of the key, and keep backups of their email in an encrypted form (with yet another strong password).<p>Can you imagine any ordinary person going through with all that just to read email?<p>--<p>2) User-managed encryption would be a support nightmare. Imagine: your grandmother buys a new laptop, and donates her old beige box to a local school. After getting home, she tries to check her email. Except she can't, because the encryption keys were on her old computer, and now they're just noise on some platters because the school's IT guy wiped the drive.<p>Would you want to be the customer support agent who had to tell her that her email was gone forever, and that she would have to make a new account with a new address?<p>This is why no major company encourages users to manage their own encryption keys, and why every company that does will never become a major company.<p>--<p>3) Google's primary value-add to anything is search. That's their brand, they are the company people go to for finding stuff. End-to-end encryption means that Gmail can't do search any more, and then what's the point of even having Gmail? Even if you could somehow convince users that it's worth putting up with all the extra hassle to protect their email, you'll never convince a company that it should scrap one of its most successful products just because a fraction of a percent of its userbase thinks its existing security features are insufficient.<p>------------------------<p>Here's another thought. The world the author describes, where people install special client software to manage their keys and read their email, ALREADY EXISTS. If people actually want to, they can download Thunderbird and GPG and set up their keys and treat Gmail as just another IMAP/SMTP service. It's an annoying process, but the only ways to make it simpler would also render it useless by reducing the security.<p>So really the author isn't asking for Gmail to support encrypted email, <i>he's asking Gmail to stop supporting un-encrypted email</i>. Hands up if you think this will ever happen.<p>The fact that nobody outside the crypto-nerd community uses existing client-side encryption support is strong evidence that most users consider the convenience of provider-readable mail to be more important than protection against police warrants.",1355609577

Not all of them of course but enough to notice the drop on facebook activity.\nHas anybody noticed a similar trend, or is it just anecdotical?. I don't know if it is the pain to use facebook on the phone that makes the people use a simpler app.(note: I am spanish)",1355609363

If you crossed it fast enough maybe no part of the brain would have enough time to realize it was isolated?

We're still writing brittle computer code that crashes a compiler upon a single slightly misspelled constant name or missing comma, where the intention would still be crystal-clear to any human programmer.

Reasons why:<p>1) Current path to comments page is inconvenient: click tweet -> go to article -> copy article title -> open new tab -> go to news.ycombinator.com -> ctrl-F -> search for article title -> click the little comments link under article title (all nearly impossible from mobile browser)<p>2) Only downside is one extra click to get to article: click tweet -> click article title on comments page<p>3) Comments are often more interesting than article itself<p>4) More traffic to the comments would grow the community and drive even more interesting discussion<p>Another option is to provide two links in each tweet.  I think that is an uglier option than the beauty of the simple ""title, link"" format currently in use.<p>Startup-mindedness involves realizing when there are annoyances in life that could be solved.

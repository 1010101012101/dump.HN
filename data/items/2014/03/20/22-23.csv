And as someone who specifically and directly <i>moved</i> from one city to another because I didn&#x27;t like the local policies (school district, in this case), I&#x27;m a straightforward and simple example of someone who left one social contract for another and paid for the privilege, thanks.<p>(If I repeat the word &quot;wrong&quot; a few more times, will it improve my opinion?)<p>The mistake of both libertarians and liberals in these loud arguments is that they focus on the top (national government) where the real social contracts start locally.  If you start to build up a system of local social contracts; well, if it quacks like a government, it&#x27;s a government, even if you&#x27;d rather call it a Homeowner&#x27;s Association with Guns.",1395356372

7439468,comment,7438569,7439325,5,0,mindslight,,,"It seems like you&#x27;re mixing another comment of mine with what I wrote above. For what it&#x27;s worth, I like Louis CK&#x27;s approach - it looks like a great post-copyright business model.<p>But your original comment is orthogonal to working within the system. Saying that companies have to &quot;protect their trademarks or lose them&quot; is indeed true in the strict legal sense. But a company could legally &quot;protect&quot; their trademark by issuing yearly licenses for token compensation for products that they consider different enough, but the law might not.<p>By taking the strict legal definition out of its narrow context, you imply that a company has no choice but to act a certain way, when in fact there are specific people responsible for its behavior. We should not allow these people abdicate their reasoning by promoting the idea that the expected corporate action is the only possible course.",1395356359

It is an explicit attempt to silence non-traditional media by the government. They have been working on controlling the traditional media (TV, newspapers, etc.) for a long time.<p>Recently, social media has been making a bigger impact, hence the explicit play. Current administration sees itself in an existential struggle and willing to do anything to stay in power.

I wrote &quot;undeniable&quot; because it is a fact--not a conjecture, opinion, or item subject to debate. Government funded and government run research programs created our space-age technology (literally) and the internet, and fueled a great percentage of the other developments that have advanced our technology so rapidly in the last several decades.<p>Private companies (whether held privately or publicly traded) are mainly creatures of fear and risk aversion--even the ones that are relatively less so than others. There&#x27;s nothing especially &quot;bleeding edge&quot; about SpaceX or Tesla, or just about anything else Musk has been involved with. Historically, it has usually taken a great thrust by the government to make big advances, whether through subsidies (i.e. corporate welfare) or direct involvement (NASA/DARPA).",1395356117

It could be true that Musk&#x27;s projects in the long run could have do more good for humanity in the long run, but also in a different sense. How is colonizing Mars, or having electric cars does more good for a whole continent that hasn&#x27;t solved dozens of problems well below any technological/energetic one? What I&#x27;m saying is, it might do more good for the developed world, but not for Africa. Bill Gates was right when he criticized Google&#x27;s balloon internet project. What the african population really needs is different. To say otherwise is to be too removed from the real, basic, almost elementary problems that are still present in the continent.<p>(edit: I meant no offense to the parent with my first sentence. But I&#x27;ve been to Africa, and I live in a 3rd world country with some very, very poor regions. Space programs have very little effect on life there.)",1395355522

This means no need to write a recipe, <i>less</i> worries about security, and more freedom for your users to use whatever libs they deem necessary (assuming such freedom is allowed).<p>- If running images directly is not doable for security reasons, your users could use Dockerfiles [1] which still allow you the benefits of Docker but with the ability to review all commands used to create the image.

Now that I can see the workload I see that it is 100 million keys for the entire cluster of 330 nodes?<p>That is 8 terabytes (n1-standard-8) of RAM for 18.6 * RF gigabytes of data or am I wrong? The entire thing should fit in the page cache assuming compaction keeps up. There are no deletes so no tombstones. On an overwrite workload I don&#x27;t know what the space amplification will be and whether you will actually run out of RAM for caching.<p>90% of people who read a benchmark aren&#x27;t going to look at it the way I do. They don&#x27;t have a cost model that says how fast things should be and how much they should cost. I do and when things are fitting in memory I have a different a different set of expectations. If I am looking at the wrong instance type please let me know.<p>For the workload you described Cassandra shouldn&#x27;t be doing random IO. I would expect there to be three + N streams of sequential IO. The write ahead log, memtable flushing, compaction output, and N streams reading tables for compaction.<p>All the write IO can be deferred and rescheduled heavily because fsyncs are infrequent. Reads for compaction are done by background tasks and shouldn&#x27;t effect foreground latency.<p>If read ahead is not working for compaction (and killing disk throughput) that may be something that needs to be addressed. Compaction should be requesting IOs large enough to amortize the cost of seeking. Page faults in memory mapped files don&#x27;t stop read ahead and I think that the kernel will even detect sequential access and double read ahead. For a workload like this with no random reads you could configure the kernel to read ahead 2-4 megabytes and the page cache would probably absorb it fine.<p>For the workload you described the only fsyncs would be the log (every 10 seconds) and memtable flushes/compaction finishing and that would normally be so infrequent as to not move the needle on overall IO capacity (although obviously it consumes sequential IO). You set trickle fsync so we are still talking about 10 megabyte writes.<p>Granted there are many things I don&#x27;t know about Cassandra. I&#x27;ve plumbed a lot of it, but it isn&#x27;t my day job. Using a 24 gigabyte heap and a 600 megabyte young generation is questionable to me. I think Cassandra can do better, and I also think there are several tools that would do the same job with 10-20x less nodes by exploiting the fact that they never have to do random reads from disk.",1395354028

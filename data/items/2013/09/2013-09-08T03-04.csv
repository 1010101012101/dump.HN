Until now that was the best thing they had. Fortunately, new technology opens new doors, and they are willing to walk through them. [1]<p>Psychiatry is a very young field, but it is very necessary.<p>Positive psychology is also a relatively new field which focuses on making patients happy, rather than diagnosing their problems, which seems to be major nitpick you have with psychiatry. Of course in some cases medicine is required simply due to physical malfunction.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-harold-koplewicz/dsm-mental-health-research_b_3247960.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-harold-koplewicz/dsm-mental...</a>",1378612770

Neither a spam filter nor contextual advertising are inherent to private communication.<p>What is relevant to private communication is that it is <i>private</i>. If I CC larry page on a &quot;private and confidential&quot; e-mail to my lawyer, Mr page is a party to the conversation. It is no longer &quot;private&quot; nor &quot;confidential&quot;. If every e-mails sent to a g-mail account is by default cc&#x27;d to Mr page, none of those communications are &quot;confidential&quot;. By (statute) law, the senders are forfeiting attorney client privledge...by &quot;opening&quot; the communication to a thrid party. Its google&#x27;s stated position that  person sending an e-mail to a g-mail account has a no &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot;. And this is what that means. This means that google (wants to) treat your mail like Mr page is reading it, and it believes that users are in <i>fact</i> waiving their expectation of privacy by using or communicating with g-mail recipients. That includes presumably senders of mail who have not agreed to g-mails T&Cs (ie, who presumably do not have reason to know what they entail).<p>It is the insertion of an active third party <i>into</i> the communication which is a problem.  Its a problem because it damages the inherent idea of &#x27;mail&#x27; as a sender-recipient private relation (post office =/= an active recipient). And from here, the problems start.<p>In any event, I think you are missing the legal abstraction at the core of the analysis. Its not a problem you can wish away, nor is it one you can trust current statutes of case law to protect into the future. That is the nature of &#x27;reasonable&#x27; modifiers; they are ultimately contextual.

Studies have shown that about 75% of patients treated with antidepressants make a recovery. This is a miracle of modern medicine.<p>The idea that treating depression is a &quot;loose and abstract field&quot; is absurd. Millions of patients suffer from a range of similar systems. They get treatment, those symptoms are gone. There is nothing abstract about it. Yes, patients react differently to different medications, which is true for thousands of non-psychiatric conditions as well. In these cases, doctors also use trial and error.<p>Public figures against antidepressants are no better than Christian scientists who encourage patients not to seek treatment for cancer.

NSDateFormatter is fast enough and you should never replace it for anything else unless you know for sure that it&#x27;s a problem. Well that goes for any optimization. In my particular case, it was really a bottleneck, and the time difference of 100 seconds vs 7 seconds meant a user will not have to wait for 93 seconds during the initial import step. I am not suggesting we start getting rid of NSDateFormatter as it is a very valuable tool which we use for any and all date formatting ourselves, just not during massive imports anymore.",1378609618

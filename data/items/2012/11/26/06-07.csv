It's not about comparing indirect calls versus direct calls, it's about comparing indirect calls against no function call at all.<p>For example, imagine a function that multiplies two matrices.  If the matrices are statically typed, the resulting function would only need to allocate the result.  If the matrices aren't statically typed, you need to dispatch on the type of each element in each matrix.  That will take <i>much</i> longer.<p>Yes, there are ways around this in languages with dynamic dispatch.  However, my point is that LLVM won't do it for you.",1353912944

Progressive real estate taxes, luxury taxes on vehicles, expensive types of clothing or jewelry, etc. wouldn't deter purchases much, but would raise money.<p>The most awesome tax I have ever seen is auctioning short license plates (done in the middle east and Hong Kong) -- pure profit for the state, and artificial scarcity created by the state.  In fact, it's ""better"" for me to own the ""1"" license plate if everyone knows I spent $10mm on it than if they thought I got it by being lucky.<p>(In general, I'd like to see more VAT + poll + etc. taxes vs. income or investment taxes.

However, they're much more concerned with fairness and being abused by third parties, since they aren't as constrained to succeed or die.  It is better for an employee of a government entity to follow process 100% correctly and ultimately fail than to take a calculated risk outside of normal process and fail, even if the expected return on the riskier path is far higher, or odds of failure lower.  Startups are exactly the opposite, since they die by default.  Big businesses are somewhere in between -- a new product failing usually won't kill the business if it fails cleanly, but could if enough corners are cut.<p>The ultimate difference between private firms and government is that a private firm which is seriously screwed up will go out of business.  A government agency can continue being dysfunctional for a long time (e.g. the Office of Thrift Supervision).

They're taken out of my check and I work with what's left.  I never think ""oh man, they're taking my money"" any more than I think ""oh man, I totally deserve to win the lottery"".<p>I do think there's something about earning money through investments that makes paying taxes ""feel"" more like your money is being taken away from you.  It's not automatically deducted.  It's not there every week.  Sometimes you lose money.  You have to pay it all at once.  Taxes are not part of the mental calculation of how much you made on that sweet stock investment.  I think that's WHY the rates are lower.  People just feel like the rates SHOULD be lower.  But it's a psychological effect.  When I look at the economic effects of the current tax scheme on a large scale, it seems to me that this kind of benefit is just a giant tax dodge.<p>Let's say that the tax rate is structured in a way that the cost of doing productive ""work"" with your capital is 30%, but the tax rate for just shuffling the money around through a bunch of investment vehicles is %15.  Well, you've suddenly got a free %15 to play around with.  And if you only need to return %10 to be considered a pretty good investment, then it seems like you really can't fail as long as you've already got enough money to play a different game than the rest of us.  But those guys are already orbital, and the rest of us can never achieve escape velocity.

You read the article and he's making straw man arguments about billionaires stuffing their cash in mattresses because their taxes are too high -- nobody is arguing that. The real problem is that taxation is economically distortionary and the higher you raise the rates, the greater the distortion. Because taxes are only due when assets are sold (and in the meantime the owner is collecting asset appreciation on the portion of the value that would have been due in taxes), capital gains tax encourages investors to hold their existing assets rather than seeking out more economically efficient ones. It encourages them to invest in more stable assets that can be held for a long period of time to defer taxes, rather than taking a risk on a startup that could cause tax to be due sooner when there is an IPO etc.<p>Or the tired numbers about how the rich are a lot richer now than they used to be and their taxes are lower, without providing evidence of causation rather than correlation. I mean sure, the richest might have 4.5X as much as they did twenty years ago instead of 5X, but is that really the big problem? Or is the real problem the regulatory capture and Wall St. shenanigans that allow the rich to double their money every five or ten years while Main St. loses their retirement fund to the same stock market?<p>At the same time, everybody just <i>assumes</i> that if you want to collect more tax money from the rich, raising the capital gains tax is the way to do it. Or the same with corporations and corporate income tax. But both of them are way, way too easy to avoid and for the same reason -- they depend on measuring profit, and it's gotten to be trivial to make an entity look unprofitable on paper. Raising the rates won't help that, it'll just push more people into tax shelters.<p>If you want to tax the rich and corporate entities then you have to tax the stuff they don't have a choice about doing. Sales tax, but the tax is paid by the seller not the customer. Income tax, but the tax is paid by the employer, not the employee. If you want to do business you need employees and customers, so they can't avoid paying taxes with shelters and loopholes. That's how you tax the rich.

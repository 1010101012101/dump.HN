Rather, the Red Army was for <i>internal</i> security, a force that would be capable of putting down individual nations/nationalities without ever having the logistical-political ability to carry out a successful coup.<p>And that sense it was very successful: they certainly had the ability to stop countries from leaving the Warsaw Pact and republics from leaving the USSR but Gorbachev ordered them to stand down. Even the coup attempt at the very end of the Soviet Union, (which involved high-ranking elements of the CP, KGB, and the military, not just the military) collapsed almost immediately. And if the KGB and the party hardliners had not been involved, it never would&#x27;ve even been attempted.",1452365947

For a lot of serious game devs, a language with a forced GC is often a no-go, for good reasons or bad, so that immediately eliminates a lot of potential candidates to replace C or C++. The only objections I frequently see people have with Nim once they look deeper into it are on syntax (not so much on indentation as on the symbol identifier rule -- case and underscore/dash insensitive except for the first character), current usability (not being 1.0), and expected longevity. Basically the same objections to Rust. (I think Rust can convert a lot of C++ game programmers eventually, I&#x27;m not so sure it can convert a lot of C game programmers because of the additional mental complexities in the name of safety, a low priority on a game dev&#x27;s list.)",1452365782

10872366,comment,10865748,10871439,0,0,azakai,,,"> I think the Dart team made all the right moves<p>They did do a lot right. But two big things that hampered adoption, I suspect, are<p>* Working on Dart in secret for a while and unintentionally revealing it to the world in a leaked email. This made it look threatening from day one, since the email seemed to imply covert plans to replace JavaScript. The impression may have been partially wrong, but given those circumstances, there was a negative initial impression.<p>* Intending to ship the Dart VM in Chrome, despite no interest - and some opposition - in standardization from all other vendors. That worried a lot of people in the web community, both because of policy reasons (vendors shouldn&#x27;t ship that way; it&#x27;s even against Google&#x27;s own Blink principles) and technical reasons (the intent was to polyfill in other browsers, but semantic differences - e.g. in numeric types - meant that was risky). In the end Google didn&#x27;t ship the VM, despite years of massive efforts towards doing so, but the damage was already done.<p>And some more minor things that I think were problems as well:<p>* Dart&#x27;s syntax looked &quot;Java-esque&quot; to many people. Java isn&#x27;t in fashion anymore. Yes, the goal was be a familiar and natural language, but it achieved that goal primarily for Java devs. Which is a large group inside Google, of course (hence other projects like GWT and Closure Compiler), but in the larger web dev community, &quot;looking like Java&quot; is a downside.<p>* The already-mentioned semantic differences on numeric types between the VM and the polyfill. Calling it &quot;undefined behavior&quot; excuses the difference, but the risk of web compatibility remains - undefined behavior makes more sense for a source language like C or C++, where you ship binaries, and not for the shipped code, especially on\nthe web. As far as I know, this was never resolved, because harmonizing those semantics had too much of a perf hit, despite attempts to optimize things. Perhaps there was too much optimism in early days that this could be achieved.",1452365602

Urbit&#x27;s central thesis is this: The fact that Google, Twitter, and Facebook control the modern internet is proof that literally everything about computing from the way network addresses are resolved to the execution model to the silicon to what we call the fucking equals sign, is deeply, fatally, irredeemably flawed and must be completely thrown out and reinvented.

I know for example there are some USB drives with SandForce controllers. But the reality is the USB stick market is quite price competitive. They tend to use bargain basement NAND quality.

I mean, if society were to collapse I&#x27;d probably die pretty quickly as I have no clue how to survive in any kind of &#x27;nature&#x27;.<p>But then, as a disability become less visible, or harder to understand, we have a tendency to not be so lenient.<p>So at some point on the spectrum we might have Lupus, which (afaik) is understood but not visible. We might sometimes get frustrated at the limitations of someone suffering from this, but we still see them as adults (<a href=""http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christ...</a>).<p>Then there&#x27;s ME, which has for a long time been treated as a psychosomatic issue. It wasn&#x27;t/isn&#x27;t well understood and the symptoms appear somewhat randomly and seem to be just &#x27;tiredness&#x27;. A family member of mine had this and sometimes I noticed it was difficult for us, the family members, to sympathize and not feel like she was a bit whiny and childish.<p>And then we have something like depression, personality disorders, or developmental disorders, which very often causes intense frustration, or anger in the surrounding people. I know a few people suffering from ADD, autism, and bipolar disorder, and they get very little sympathy.",1452365241

Before we purchase one, I&#x27;d like to take the opportunity to buy a programmable one so I can mess around with it, too (and teach the kids to program it).<p>EDIT: Ideally, I&#x27;d like something like this, but programmable/hackable: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MNG37C2/ref=s9_simh_gw_g21_i1_r?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=desktop-1&pf_rd_r=01GMYMFRR2QNC3AT5DG0&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=2079475242&pf_rd_i=desktop<p>Thanks!",1452363757

Modern OSs like MacOS, Windows, and desktop Linux are presumably intended to make using computers easier. Each new release adds reams of new code implementing new features intended to improve ease of use. Yet the net effect is often negative, because the sheer amount of code added makes the overall system significantly slower.<p>Meanwhile, new programming languages abound, presumably to make programmers&#x27; lives easier. But these developments often completely lose sight of the users. Python is easier to write, but a program written in python uses 1000x the CPU and memory resources of a program written in C. It does the job, but slowly, and consuming so much that the computer is unable to do anything else productive. Meanwhile, it&#x27;s questionable whether programmers&#x27; lives have been improved either, because they spend too much time chasing the next new tool instead of growing expertise in just one.<p>As for marginal efficiency gains - that is only a symptom of the latter developer problem. E.g., LMDB is pure C, less than 8KLOCs, and is orders of magnitude faster than every other embedded database engine out there. It is also 100% crash-proof and offers a plethora of features that other DB engines lack. All while being able to execute entirely within a CPU&#x27;s L1 cache.

Pricing of black is on average 10-20% below normal taxi&#x27;s. All driver&#x27;s I&#x27;ve asked have said that they prefer uber for mainly 3 reasons:<p>1. Control over when they drive<p>2. Higher utilisation (which in extension should be a big driver for Uberpool)<p>3. Friendlier/less troublesome passengers<p>Some actually bought (nice) new cars (Mercedes/BMW) and explained me a bit more about the economics of buying a new car and how it made sense for them while driving for Uber. Many I spoke to share the car with another driver to get more rides done per day.<p>As such, I wouldn&#x27;t assume that most drivers don&#x27;t account for the  total cost of ownership.

At worst, the US giant Google is equivalent to what China has done. At best, it&#x27;s better, because the US government didn&#x27;t have to meddle quite so much to force such growth to occur.<p>So I don&#x27;t really see how Baidu is some terrific example of IT flourishing. If anything, Google, Facebook, and the companies that will follow their inevitable fall are noteworthy.<p>And if you don&#x27;t like Google, you have alternatives for every one of its services.

I believe you are correct, though I have not yet had a chance to benchmark it.<p>It seems like there are a few different &quot;shortcuts&quot; that pre-load the kernel into memory (like `qemu -kernel`) from different tools.  For example, I know also of `kvmtool` used in the clear containers project[1].<p>I&#x27;m not sure if all of them choose multiboot[2] as their standard and it&#x27;s not clear how much of a traditional boot could or should be pushed into the hypervisor.  `kvmtool` prepares a 64-bit environment with the Linux &quot;zero page&quot; structure instead of multiboot.<p>From a unikernel perspective I think this is an interesting question to ask, because typical CPU setup including page tables (direct map is common for such a simple kernel) and segment registers, etc. will likely all be boilerplate.  It will almost certainly be faster to preload the CPU and memory than to do it at boot time.  (At the cost of reducing the number of hypervisors that can boot the kernel)<p>[1]: <a href=""https://lwn.net/Articles/644675/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lwn.net/Articles/644675/</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/multiboot.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/multiboot...</a>",1452362598

For too long, the scientific community has been content to leave the justice system to its own devices. Letting it carry on as a scientific backwater, like nutrition or social science. Consequently, police have technology without any idea of how to use it, or more importantly how to understand its limitations. For example, forensic experts are routinely allowed to testify about random match probabilities as if they are equivalent to the probability of guilt, even though in practice lab error dominates the random match probability as a source of error.<p>This is an area where technologists can succeed where their colleagues in the physical sciences have failed. It is easy to pass off quackery as reliable forensic methods. It would be a disaster if, e.g., it was as easy to pass off quackery as legitimate data forensics. The only way that can be prevented is if the legitimate practitioners, the institutions that represent the mainstream of the profession, are vocal in calling out the charlatans that use unreliable methods.",1452362438

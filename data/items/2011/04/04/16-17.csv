2407373,comment,2406292,2406951,1,0,rick888,,,"""While the data itself is free, or very cheap indeed""<p>The data isn't what you are paying for.  You are paying for the years of experience and creativity involved with creating the album. Also, this isn't really for you to decide.  The market decides this.  It's been forced upon the artists and the record labels by people illegally downloading and copying music, but this isn't the market.<p>""Look at IT for a moment. For nearly every commercial IT product out there, you see free alternatives.""<p>We aren't talking about a band like Metallica coming out and competing with Metallica with free music.  We are talking about making copies of Metallica and competing with the music that actually costs money.<p>""Yet the commercial stuff turns decent profit. Some companies sell services for the free product and make a decent buck.""<p>This is one of the only ways to make money with free software, aside from donations and advertising.  Good, free software has only been around for 10 years.  Eventually, it will drive the cost of commercial software down to nothing.  This is why I stopped selling applications and moved everything to services.<p>""And, perhaps surprisingly, developers of free software also manage to get jobs and gigs. Both ecosystems thrive. Musicians can -- and sometimes actually do -- follow that way too.""<p>I'm glad you mentioned developers, because there is another consequence of having so much free software.  Because there is so much free software out there, most businesses don't really need engineers anymore.  The difficult parts of the software are already out there, for free.  They just need to hire someone to make custom changes to it, which can usually be done with a much less-experienced developer at a much cheaper rate.<p>Most business owners aren't tech-savvy enough to realize this right now, but as the younger generation starts to own more businesses, it's only going to get worse for developers.  I've already started seeing this.<p>The hypocritical part about all of this is that if mass amounts of companies started ignoring the GNU license and putting code in their proprietary apps, many of the same pro-piracy people would be talking about ""theft"" and ""stealing code"".  I've seen this with pretty much every discussion about a company violating the GNU on HN.<p>""Now you were telling us the album prices weren't inflated? And don't even get me started on product bundling -- where you'd have to buy an album with a dozen songs to get one or two decent.""<p>No, I'm saying people used that as a reason why they were pirating and now that you can get albums at a very cheap price, piracy hasn't stopped or slowed, it's only gotten worse.<p>""where you'd have to buy an album with a dozen songs to get one or two decent.""<p>Somehow instead of not buying albums, people continued to buy them at this price..as if it was a matter of life and death.",1301936387

On the tools side, as several people have mentioned below, we are releasing a new IDE this week called Titanium Studio.  This release will address two critical areas that you identified in your post: debugging and overall tooling stability.  The IDE itself is based on Aptana Studio, which has several years of solid development behind it.  Sample projects, code completion, and other frequently-asked features will be included.  Titanium Studio ships this week.<p>Certainly there are other areas in your post where we can improve.  Know that we are making investments in all of the areas you describe and we certainly appreciate everyone's support as we grow the platform, the community, and the supporting infrastructure behind it.<p>Thanks again for your feedback<p>Best Regards,<p>Scott Schwarzhoff\nVP, Developer Relations",1301936324

2407320,comment,2406655,2406655,57,0,grellas,,,"I don't know details about the patent portfolio upon which this bid was made so as to comment upon it specifically, but I can make a couple of observations about Google's strategic approach to patents:<p>1. Google is definitely <i>not</i> ""anti-patent,"" either philosophically or otherwise. At the heart of its business is the PageRank patent, which is assigned to Stanford with exclusive license to Google. Even within the last month, Google got a patent for its ""Systems and methods for enticing users to access a web site,"" i.e., its ""Google Doodle"" (see <a href=""http://ipwatchdog.com/2011/03/25/google-patents-the-google-doodle/id=15873/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ipwatchdog.com/2011/03/25/google-patents-the-google-d...</a> for an overview on this). And, of course, the blog post involved here very carefully delineates and distinguishes patents that foster innovation (presumably good) and others that are primarily gained to foment litigation, in particular ""low-quality software patents.""<p>2. Of course, Google is involved in a current, major fight involving Oracle's assertion of both copyright and patent Java-related claims against its Android technology. Google is a powerful adversary to take on, and it is blasting away quite skillfully seeking to invalidate the Oracle patents in that suit on <i>Bilski</i> grounds that they constitute ""abstract ideas"" and not bona fide patentable subject matter (see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1899156"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1899156</a> for a summary of relevant issues in that case). But no powerful litigant ever bets solely on how a court might interpret some nebulous body of law such as what constitutes patentable subject matter. As matters now stand, should Google lose on that issue, it has very little in the way of defense against such claims. Perhaps the patents upon which it is bidding will give it a practical way to attack Oracle so as to bolster its defense but, again, I don't know about the immediate portfolio or whether it even relates to the Java-related claims. That said, however, I am certain that the Oracle litigation, at a minimum, has spurred Google to consider this issue very carefully and to determine that it needs these tools very badly so as not to be exposed in the future to patent broadsides to which it has no answer other than to point out how weak the relevant patents are - which may be no answer at all in the real world of patent litigation. Hence, this patent portfolio bid has either an immediate aim in mind (Oracle litigation) or a long-term aim with the same strategic view in mind (cover yourself against flim-flam patent claims that might hinder Google's future ability to innovate).<p>3. The FTC recently issued a comprehensive report on the need for patent reform, and one of its main points concerned so-called ""non-practicing entities"" or what it has chosen to call ""patent-assertion entites"" (PAEs) or what is commonly known as ""trolls"" (see HN discussion here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2303980"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2303980</a>). These are patent holders who do not use their patents to produce things but rather use them solely for licensing and the concomitant litigation that inevitably follows against those who decline the licensing ""offer."" In reality, the PAE idea is much more complex than merely that of a shakedown racket. All sorts of large tech companies routinely gather up all sorts of patents for which they have no plans to innovate but which are vital to their business strategies, either to be used to attack rivals or to defend against them and whether for good or for bad motives. In making this bid, Google is basically acknowledging that it needs to arm itself in this department. This is neither inherently good or bad and could be used strictly for protecting Google's ability to innovate or it could be abused down the road, all depending on future choices to be made by the company's management. It is certainly a double-edged issue.<p>Groklaw recently ran a piece answering the question ""what's blocking innovation in America"" and answered it with ""IP laws"" - this in turn led to some sparks flying here at HN as some, like me, defended IP in general while saying that it needs to be reformed and (many) others taking the more radical view that IP laws generally are to be castigated (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2210469"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2210469</a>).

You need to make sure your use case is covered in the Kitchen Sink example.  If you can't take those pieces and put together what you want to build than you shouldn't bother with Appcelerator (the documentation is pretty useless)<p>2.  You need to buy support.  The community is non-existent but the staff support is pretty good.

They are more expensive to manufacture than the good old squirrel cage induction motor, but synchronous machines in general are more efficient over a wider range of output rotational rates than induction machines, have somewhat better failure modes, and are much easier to start up.<p>In many cases, it's cheaper to (try to) solve these problems with smart drive electronics, i.e., add additional complication to the cheap part of the system rather than to the expensive part. But for the highest output machines---multi-megawatt generators, for example---synchronous machines remain king.<p>There are some other fun things you can do with motor drive electronics. A lab mate of mine in grad school wrote a cool thesis on using the iron in an induction machine as an electric transformer in such a way that the motor drive and power converter could be controlled independently. In essence, in a Y-connected three-phase system, the motor is insensitive to 3rd harmonic content in the drive signal, so you can pass energy through the air gap in the 3rd harmonic and rectify it on the other side to turn your induction machine into the magnetics for a power converter.<p><a href=""http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/28691"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/28691</a>",1301933444

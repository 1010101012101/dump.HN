It is hard for me to believe that someone who doesnt understand SQL can be a competent ORM programmer.<p>The system I mentioned was well designed with hundreds of tables, multiple replicated database servers, dozens of web servers, caching and all that.  The problem was a specific case where knowledge of SQL was able to produce a 50x performance improvement.<p>I think SQL essential to learn because it bends your mind.  You have to think in terms of sets instead of sequential processes.  Just like functional programming and BNF are mind stretching.",1314737953
2943223,comment,2940552,2942521,2,0,Dn_Ab,,,"Oh right I see. But don't you think introducing matrices as a type of transformation between vector spaces is too much too early? One reason maths is so difficult is that our brain simply has no point of comparison to bootstrap the concepts with. You just get used to it over time with effort. Starting so abstract would leave many people lost at sea.<p>But then again, a lot of why matrix algebra was so confusing at first is it all seemed so arbitrary. Just memorizing a bunch of boring human calculable unmotivated algorithms. I get angry thinking about it. It wasn't till I read about how they came about in 1800s and studied linear algebra did they start to make sense.<p>Maybe maths beyond basic probability,geometry and algebra - which can be readily motivated to everyday life - should not be taught to everyone.

As a techie, I know that uneasy feeling when you're about to pick up the phone to dial someone. We all know if you wait until you're NOT embarrassed to show your target market for feedback, you've waited too long to get feedback.<p>So here's my no-strings-attached offer: If you have a barebones prototype / MVP, I'll use that to test your target market for you. I'll talk to at least 5 people, max 10, for free.<p>If you haven't yet made contact with a single person in your target market, simply testing it with as little as 5-10 people will at least uncover the top 3 major objections that you might want to think of addressing. All the things Customer Development & Lean Startup champions for early stage startups when you're still finding a business model.<p>That's it.

Do you know what to do when you actually have a sales person reporting to you? What would the sales guy be doing on his first day? I'm that very early 1st sales guy (where I'm also helping you figure out the sales process).<p>This can be a very time consuming activity, if you've done any of these initial interviews, you know they can be as short as someone hanging up on you, or as long as a few hours.<p>Minimum criteria:<p>* At least an MVP that you're embarrassed of to test with. Could be a landing page.<p>* At least have a hypothesis of what the customer's problem/pain is<p>* Give me a list of 5-10 people's contact info to call up or email (usually sales people focus on converting leads into sales, but someone still has to send them the leads to hit up in the first place)<p>* Specific for this offer, I can't do B2B and/or long sales-cycle stuff where you have to navigate the corporate org chart (time constraint). Maybe in future. My goal is to help as many very very early stage startups as possible.<p>If you're pouring your blood and sweat by coding day and night ... you owe it to yourself to at least say ""I know people are going to love what I'm building, but let me just check-in with real live customers real quick""<p>Hit me up and let's talk to see if I can help!

The purpose of government is to serve the interests of <i>people</i>. Rhode Island is a legal fiction delimited by imaginary lines; you and I are real people.

No one actually decided to establish a federal democracy in North America and divide it into states, different people from entirely different countries just happened to colonize different parts of the continent without ever intending that New Amsterdam and Jamestown would ever fall under the same American government. The Constitution was a political compromise based on the fact that thirteen of those colonies broke away from the mother country and needed a federal government.

This is probably a good average city for America - not too big, not too small.

You don't need to ban all communication, to remove privacy in practice.<p>Crypto is currently usable in practice.  Its a bit hard for many users, but its doable, especially with modern VPN implementations.
If any encrypted tunnel is allowed, you can put all your traffic through it, and no one knows whether you are surfing banned websites, or working on the corporate VPN.
And you can be pretty confident your modern crypto implementation isn't going to be broken.<p>But steganography <i>isn't</i> really usable, in practice.
If nothing else, the government can do traffic analysis, and see suspiciously large traffic volumes going to a small collection of servers (which are accepting the steg'd communication, and proxying your requests, presumably).<p>And even if the traffic looks like normal HTTP, with images in it, that's simply not good enough to use, in a regime where the secret police can arrest you if they suspect you are trying to hide your traffic content. And they will be able to find users, because eventually the servers accepting steg'd traffic, which the population are using, will become known.<p>So, while I think it'd be very hard to remove the ability to send small amounts of text data, from the Internet, I think it'd be possible to make private communication unworkable, in practice, for most people.<p>I don't see how this would be worked around, without building a massive distributed network of computers that all accepted and routed steg'd communication; something like if every webserver would accept, and onion-route, incoming steg'd traffic.<p>That doesn't exist, so I think their initiative will work, if they push it enough; hopefully rules like this remain isolated to relatively repressive regimes, and not gain widespread adoption; the widespread commercial use of encrypted communications is probably the best defence against global crypto bans.",1314736148

In response, then-graduate student Sweeney started hunting for the Governors hospital records in the GIC data. She knew that Governor Weld resided in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a city of 54,000 residents and seven ZIP codes. For twenty dollars, she purchased the complete voter rolls from the city of Cambridge, a database containing, among other things, the name, address, ZIP code, birth date, and sex of every voter. By combining this data with the GIC records, Sweeney found Governor Weld with ease. Only six people in Cambridge shared his birth date, only three of them men, and of them, only he lived in his ZIP code. In a theatrical flourish, Dr. Sweeney sent the Governors health records (which included diagnoses and prescriptions) to his office.''<p>Source: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/09/your-secrets-live-online-in-databases-of-ruin.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/09/your-secrets...</a>",1314735627

If users add the cert to the ""trusted"" list they won't get the warning anymore.",1314734645

2943017,comment,2942627,2942914,3,0,ansy,,,"This has been forwarded before and I agree with detractors to this kind of thinking.<p>First, HP is a big company that has much better ways to turn money into more money than making something people are unwilling to buy at a reasonable price.<p>Second, growing the webOS ecosystem in this way founds it on false principles. Everything that seems to work when you're selling for a loss, might not work at all when you're selling for a profit. Just imagine if HP started off selling a $99 TouchPad, blowing out the doors, piling up billions in debt, and then found out everyone wanted an iPad when the price went up to $500. Oops.<p>The best modern example of this I think is Groupon. Groupon has been growing like crazy by taking a huge loss. For every dollar it takes, two dollars go out the door in the form of advertising and client acquisition.<p>Groupon is already of questionable value to some businesses. When the time comes for Groupon to fix its profitability the value proposition may be lost entirely.",1314734607
2943016,comment,2941886,2942924,2,0,dcaldwell,,,"Maybe we should reword that.<p>The thinking behind that is that the really small nonprofits that we work with are generally relieved to find out that they can still use their domain name on their business cards and brochures and email and just forward the domain to their Bellstrike subdomain.<p>As a general rule most small nonprofits aren't techies, don't know the difference between hosting and a domain name and don't know what a 301 redirect is or that it's even possible.  That being said, we'll certainly talk about rewording that so that it's clearer for the tech oriented audience and doesn't seem misleading.  That's a pretty easy change :)<p>We do plan on offering a domain masking service like Flavors.me, Carbonmade, etc. where they won't have the need to do a 301 redirect.<p>Thanks for the feedback.  We just launched today so we're glad to hear your thoughts so we can make corrections.",1314734603

The system encourages this behavior. The logic is completely flawed: If you don't use the money, then you obviously don't need it.  Next time you won't receive the full amount from your grant.  When your grant is millions of dollars over a few years, you end up having a lot of very nice dinners paid for with money that was meant to be used for research and education.",1314734437

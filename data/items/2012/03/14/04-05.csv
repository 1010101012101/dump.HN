They're not going to stand by and let Facebook and Twitter own the login authentication process the same way Google currently owns the website analytics process.<p>Any user can create a context-specific throwaway identity on the net, and Gmail used to be an easy way to do that.

It has no business prosecuting wealth creators like Martha Stewart (remember also that it came close to doing the same thing Steve Jobs, with the backdating ""scandal"").

3701756,comment,3700277,3701128,22,0,6ren,,,"Clayton Christensen's ""The Innovator's Dilemma"" was motivated by DEC getting killed.  He claims that DEC was a victim of a disruption: a new technology that offered something that didn't seem to be a threat, become successful in other markets and eventually improved enough that it was threat - then it was too late.  There, the old technology was minicomputers; the new technology was workstations.<p>The new technology isn't perceived as a threat because it is not as good and will never be as good in the old market.  It manages to survive in a different new market (because it really can't compete in the old pond). As it improves, it never catches up with the old technology - but it becomes <i>good enough</i>.  That is, the old technology has also improved, and is definitely better - but the old market doesn't care for that extra improvement. You can see there are a few things that have to happen for disruption to occur.<p>One of the reasons for Google's 20% was to try to prevent this kind of thing, but it never worked out.  Some business types redefine terms, so that ""invention"" is a new technology (make something), and ""innovation"" is a new business (people want).  Google's made a lot of stuff, but most isn't wanted and didn't create a business. They aren't innovations.  Closing down businesses that aren't making enough to move the needle is the classic mistake of disrupted businesses: Christensen suggests setting up separate, autonomous business units (even separate businesses; startups), with limited resources, that <i>will</i> get excited by small wins - because new disruptions start small.  (YC is pretty much doing it right...)<p>However, right now, Google is fighting for its life. At the beginning, facebook didn't seem threatening - or at least not <i>that</i> threatening. Then again, I'm not sure that Google ever could win this fight; social is such a different kind of business.  Perhaps the best that google could hope for is to settle back into owning search forever.<p>My only disappointment is that google didn't manage to transform its internal inventions into innovations.  I'm not saying it's easy or that I could do better, it's just that unlike winning social, it seems <i>possible</i>... and who knows what new disruptions might have come from that?<p>As it is, Google seems closer to Xerox: one fantastic invention/business, invents the future, makes no money from it.",1331698576

3701753,comment,3698637,3700632,1,0,beagle3,,,"Excellent points.<p>> Compulsory licensing for trademarks doesn't make sense; their purpose is to ensure that the consumer knows who manufactured the product. If you can't exercise control over the people that use your trademark, it's useless.<p>Perhaps it is wrong to bundle trademarks with the rest of them. The consumer protection angle is what makes them different than the copyright and patent monopolies.<p>Trademarks are sometimes used defensively - only Google Inc can lay claim to be the device you use to ""google stuff"". However, they are sometimes used offensively - e.g. Cisco vs. Apple on the iPhone trademark, and the still ongoing Apple vs. Chinese-company-whose-name-I-don't-know iPad trademark.<p>The ""use it or lose it"" status of trademarks makes the current situation a little better than patents, but still, offensive use of Trademark should cost the user in proportion to their benefit.<p>A really crazy idea: ""compulsory hostile trademark takeover"" - you'd be able to take over anyone's trademark for 100x the value they assign to it (And on which they pay 1% tax or whatever). e.g. I can register a trademark 'iJoke' for $75, but if I want to keep it, I need to say how much it is worth to me on my tax return and pay 1%. Let's say I declare $1M. Then I need to pay $10K in tax, and Apple can forcibly take it away for $100M (paid in advance, in escrow) and waiting 12 months for me to lose my trademark rights (although they gain shared trademark right away). A non-government ""eminent domain"", if you will. Might also work well against domain squatters. Same underlying idea: make cost-of-carry proportional to value.<p>> Patent litigation is too expensive for small firms and too cheap for large ones; figuring out how to fix this would be a big win. That can be done by adjusting the actual cost, the outcome probability, or the judgement amount. Time until judgement is also a big factor.<p>I agree, although I have no specific suggestion about how to adjust that. In Finland, traffic tickets are a percentage of your yearly income, with a minimum but no maximum. So a speeding ticket isn't cheap even for big earners - a $60K ticket happens a few times a year. (They are still cheap to people who already have a fortune but not come, though).<p>Perhaps there's someway to make that depend on value too -- e.g., there is a progressive tax on income to be able to sue; e.g. when you sue someone, you pay 0.01% of your yearly income for every day in court, whether you win or lose. So 2.5% if you spend every workday in court suing people. Obviously, court services are more valuable to you if you have more income.<p>> This system doesn't address the problem of submarine patents, that are kept hidden for years until a lot of firms are unknowingly infringing, and then get sued for large damages. It needs to address how a company knows whether or not it needs to license a patent for its technology. Perhaps holding a patent on a technology should give you ""clear to operate"" approval, and existing patent holders must review and challenge patent applications before they're granted.<p>On the contrary. Now you'd actually have an incentive to do a patent search, and lock down low fees by private agreements so that they cannot be inflated later the way submarine patents are used today.<p>Although it might help to codify this somehow; e.g., if you hold a patent, declare value $1M (paying $10K/year to maintain). I offer you $10M upfront for 5 years license (Twice what you declare it is worth). You decline. I document my offer, and use it anyway, paying only the compulsory $1M/year for the first year. On the 2nd year, you declare it worth $10M (in an attempt to extract more money from me). I'll have to pay up or stop using it. But <i>you</i> can get in trouble with the tax authorities for (allegedly) reporting a much lower value.<p>Basic ideas:<p>1. Tie cost-of-property-carry to real world value<p>2. Use tax authorities to coerce everyone into estimating values sensibly and defensibly.",1331698427

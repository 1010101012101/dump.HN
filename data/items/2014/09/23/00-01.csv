8353523,comment,8352032,8352032,1,0,d0ugie,,,"I am bipolar. Right now I am in a fluctuating depressive episode I am trying with my several drugs to escape without, and this is tricky, without flying into mania. Usually I am on top of this - happily married, good job, good life, haven&#x27;t been psychotic in many years. Episodes generally minor in depth or elevation, brief, and few and far between.<p>But right now I am not on point and it&#x27;s affecting my job, and my perception of how good it is and possibly a major decision I might make under the influence, if you will, of too little or too much serotonin, whether or not to jump ship in pursuit of greener pastures or some strong paranoia that I will be fired or that my team&#x27;s project will get canned.<p>I am disengaged, not enjoying it, disengaged socially from my team, I am way behind in my email (work and personal), I ducked out at 2pm today to go lie in bed, I am unsure if I am dissatisfied because I have good reason to be or if my perception is distorted by the depression.<p>My Zoloft kicked in last week and I felt as though I had the best and most productive two days in a row, following two sick days I felt compelled to take. So another challenge is to figure out whether my suddenly improved impression of my job was distorted by hypomania. Bipolars need to be careful with SSRIs, but a calculated risk for me now.<p>Bipolar is dangerous to disclose. But I fear I may be testing my boss&#x27;s patience and disclosure would buy me latitude <i>but</i> I&#x27;d only do that  concealing that I am struggling with manic depression, rather just garden variety depression. Or with levity, that I have a tummy ache, but in my mind.<p>I guess I&#x27;ll try to correct myself medically and keep my mouth shut, and consider having this in my back pocket if I leave early one too many times. Though my boss and team are smart people, and many people have some familiarity with mental illness, so my money&#x27;s on his already knowing I have a few screws loose. Which might be why he didn&#x27;t inquire about the nature of my sudden illness, instead being quite accomodating even on my request for second day. I&#x27;m grateful for that, though I can&#x27;t help but read into that.<p>One thing I envy about gays, in addition to their charisma and fashion sense, is how much less trapped in their closet than I am in mine (or so I suspect). Gays don&#x27;t have a reputation for going postal. People fear bipolar folks even if they are &quot;high functioning&quot; and treated enough to blend in. I guess I would too in their shoes.<p>Wow that was long, sorry, but my sudden  loquaciousness is a sign I may be escaping my depressive episode in this therapeutic comment box. Thanks, Hacker News! ;)",1411433903

At first you need debugging symbols to pinpoint the problem, then you need to read the source.. it all takes time. E.g. you need to learn about dbus-monitor and dbus calls and need to grasp some internal concepts of systemd if something goes wrong. It takes time and patience you usally don&#x27;t have or don&#x27;t want to spend on such details. For comparison i.e. FreeBSD rc is only shell-scripts: <a href=""http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?rc(8)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?rc(8)</a><p>I don&#x27;t want to say that one is better than the other but the latter is for most folks far easier to debug and modify than the first.

The long story about this can be found in the books <i>The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy</i>[1] or <i>Visible Speech: The Diverse Oneness of Writing Systems</i>[2] by the late John DeFrancis or the book <i>Ideogram: Chinese Characters and the Myth of Disembodied Meaning</i>[3] by J.

8353511,comment,8351482,8352239,3,0,inthewoods,,,"Did you read the complaint?<p>&quot;The facts indicate that the basket option structures examined in this investigation were devised by sophisticated financial firms to allow clients to circumvent federal taxes and leverage limits. The structures rested on two fictions. The first was that the bank, rather than the hedge fund, owned the assets being traded in the designated option accounts, even though the hedge fund bought and sold the assets, was exposed to all significant risks and rewards, and profited from the trading, with little input from the bank serving as the nominal owner of the assets. In \neffect, the structure purported to enable the hedge fund to purchase an “option” on its own trading activity, an arrangement that makes no economic sense outside of an effort to bypass federal taxes and leverage limits. The second fiction was that the profits from the trades controlled by the hedge fund could be treated as long-term capital gains, even for trades lasting seconds. That fiction depended upon the hedge fund claiming that the profits came from exercising the “option” rather than from executing the underlying trades. In fact, the “option” functioned as little more than a fictional derivative, permitting the hedge fund to cast short-term capital gains as long-term gains and authorizing financing at levels otherwise legally barred for a customer’s U.S. brokerage account.&quot;<p>So the complaint is that this was fictional derivatives used to mask ownership of the underlying assets and thereby avoid taxes. I&#x27;m going to do some more research but it does sound shady.<p>Earlier, the complaint points out that the IRS has already identified this as abusive behavior but has not acted:<p>&quot;While that type of option product was identified as abusive in a public memorandum by the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) in 2010, taxes have yet to be collected on many of the basket option transactions and its use to circumvent federal leverage limits has yet to be analyzed or halted.&quot;",1411433596

Also if the slaves are pulling the sled to the right, why are half of them looking left?<p>The posture is all wrong for pulling on ropes, whilst the posture of the single person pouring water is more natural.<p>Would a single water pourer be enough. If not why wouldn&#x27;t they have used the &quot;stacked&quot; technique they&#x27;ve used elsewhere to show there were more than one?

A switch from non-structured to structured data provides a significant advantage, and indexes are useful. At least I had too many times grepping a multi-gigabyte log file. Sure, relatively modern (RFC5424) syslog protocol has structured data too, but in my experience most software had never bothered to use it. So, forcing a switch through introducing another protocol that has structured data baked-in isn&#x27;t a too terrible idea.<p>My only issue with journald&#x27;s binary log files is that they&#x27;re of homebrewn custom format, that&#x27;s not accessible by any standard means. Plain text files aren&#x27;t directly readable by humans, too, but we have cat, less or alike tools to pass such data to terminal (sometimes an iconv is required, say, if log entries contain filenames that has characters outside of ASCII range), and those tools are available on every modern OS out there.<p>Personally, I think, a compromise that&#x27;d satisfy me (YMMV) would be either an industry-standard log format (like, maybe, sqlite - it&#x27;s fairly simple, universal and omnipresent nowadays) or, even better, storing data in text files, but having accompanying binary index and metadata ones that store non-human-readable stuff (like hash chain - bet, no sane human would ever check cryptographic log integrity by hand) and provide additional information for faster machine access.<p>But the heck journald is a tightly-coupled part of into systemd instead of being a separate project is beyond me. I can&#x27;t reject that systemd has some good things about it too, but it&#x27;s too terribly monolithic and unhackable compared to mostly-scripted init systems.

One of the things this post criticizes, and Poettering criticizes, is the BSD-inherited daemon() function. Being curious, I looked at the function&#x27;s implementation, both in FreeBSD&#x27;s implementation, and glibc&#x27;s implementation. FreeBSD&#x27;s implementation handles pretty much everything the daemon writer themself would want to -- it sets the signal handlers and masks appropriately, double forks, creates a session, sets PIDs unless you tell it not to, and changes to the root directory unless you tell it not to. Glibc&#x27;s misses important steps, like the signal manipulations, tries too hard to create a typical null device, and otherwise completely misses the point.<p>The biggest problem I see with system is that the developers don&#x27;t play well with others. Instead of working with various parties, like the glibc maintainers, to fix deficiencies elsewhere, they expect developers everywhere to drop what they&#x27;re doing to redesign how their projects work, when they work just fine for the many, many other unix architectures out there.

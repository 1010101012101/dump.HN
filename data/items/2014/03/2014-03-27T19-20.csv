The right clip shows the reconstruction of this segment from brain activity measured using fMRI. The procedure is as follows:<p>[1] Record brain activity while the subject watches several hours of movie trailers.<p>[2] Build dictionaries (i.e., regression models) that translate between the shapes, edges and motion in the movies and measured brain activity. A separate dictionary is constructed for each of several thousand points at which brain activity was measured.\n(For experts: The real advance of this study was the construction of a movie-to-brain activity encoding model that accurately predicts brain activity evoked by arbitrary novel movies.)<p>[3] Record brain activity to a new set of movie trailers that will be used to test the quality of the dictionaries and reconstructions.<p>[4] Build a random library of ~18,000,000 seconds (5000 hours) of video downloaded at random from YouTube. (Note these videos have no overlap with the movies that subjects saw in the magnet). Put each of these clips through the dictionaries to generate predictions of brain activity. Select the 100 clips whose predicted activity is most similar to the observed brain activity. Average these clips together. This is the reconstruction.<p>With the actual paper here:<p><a href=""http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982211009377"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982211...</a>",1395950346

7482983,comment,7480094,7481931,1,0,tgb,,,"I do not understand your description in terms of push broom scanners. Scanning is done by a linear array of sensors that detect at varying angles that go off perpendicular to the angle of motion of the satellite. Imaging in the direction of motion of the satellite is done by physically moving the satellite - which of course is happening quite quickly. This is like looking through a slit in a door frame - you move the light sensor perpendicular to the slit to see the objects inside (except not a perfect analogy: it would be more like carrying the doorframe with you as you move so that you need to move x distance to see something x distance from what you were first seeing). The image is being taken orthographically along one direction. So for the red sensor to see what the green sensor is currently seeing, the satellite must move forward by a few inches so that the red sensor is above the same spot as the green sensor was earlier.<p>This is not how traditional photography works. There is actually a one-to-one correspondence of motion of the sensor with displacement of the imaged object (in one direction). This is similar to how a &quot;photo finish&quot; is done [1]  Since the satellite moves much faster than the plane and the displacement between the sensors is small, it seems that the plane should not have traveled very far.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish</a>",1395950123

The purpose of IP-protection tools (DRM) isn&#x27;t typically to limit the availability of a product-- it&#x27;s to limit possession of a product such that the quantity possessed is equal to the quantity purchased (the attempt to minimize piracy).<p>There have been cases where companies have tried to artificially induce scarcity--I recall that during the release of a certain Battlefield game, EA&#x27;s storefront had temporarily &quot;sold out&quot; of digital copies--and in that case, the same DRM-based distribution tech that was designed for IP protection was being used to induce scarcity.<p>In other words, if ten people are trying to purchase your product, IP enforcement means you want exactly ten copies to exist.  Inducing artificial scarcity means you want fewer than ten copies to exist.<p>It&#x27;s hard to find examples of artificial scarcity in the digital world, which is what makes this somewhat interesting to me.

I&#x27;ve installed it and then quickly got rid of it as soon as I noticed it ran an 80mb process in the background of which i couldn&#x27;t tell if it was downloading torrents or not. A headless torrent client is nice, but not if you can&#x27;t see what it&#x27;s doing.<p>The <i>cool</i> thing about this though it is that the api can connect to uTorrent (v3.3+)/BitTorrent client and that that&#x27;s completely working in production already (at least on windows systems)<p>Just last week I&#x27;ve reverse engineered the protocol and made an angular.js implementation of this that removes all the dependencies to backbone and cleans up the code, separating UI-elements from the actual communication service.

I myself drive from SF to the Peninsula. I don&#x27;t recommend it. Public transportation is not an option for most people purely because of the lack of geographical coverage they offer. For instance, I can&#x27;t use caltrain or bart because I don&#x27;t live downtown and it takes 40-50 minutes to get to the train by bus.

Limited partners in a fund this size are usually pension funds (CalPERS), university and not-for-profit endowments (Harvard, Brown, MacArthur Foundation), and maybe high-net-worth individuals.<p>So A16Z raises commitments of 1.5B from all of these people who have a lot of money that they want to grow. Those people deploy their capital to VC, to Hedge/PE funds, to timber, to public markets, to bonds, etc.<p>A16Z aren&#x27;t actually given a pile of cash though, instead A16Z does capital calls on an as-needed basis. Then A16Z deploys that capital to startups and other companies over the life of the fund (often ten years with some extensions).<p>Most venture funds operate on something like a &quot;two and twenty model&quot; meaning that every year they get 2% of the funds value for operating expenses. In A16Z they have a huge staff of designers, recruiters, BD experts, etc, that help their startups. The 2% goes toward things like that.<p>The 20% is carry, which is earned as a percentage of net income. So let&#x27;s say that A16Z invests 5M in a company on a 10M pre-money valuation. A16Z owns 1/3 of the company. The company sells for $30M the next day to Facebook. A16Z now has $10M dollars.

5512066,comment,5510914,5511995,15,0,ndespres,,,"You're wrong about this.<p>-dairy animals can be chosen based on their long-term milk production (my goats haven't been bred in 2+ years and are still giving more milk than I know what to do with, and when they are finally bred we have other uses for males around the farm).<p>-I hatch my own chicks and the males are not ground alive (or tossed in trash, or euthanized, or whatever). My chickens get as much love as my dogs do.<p>-Of course it's impossible to produce meat without killing an animal, but it is very much possible to produce meat while caring about the animal immensely and ensuring its quality of life is never compromised (save for the last instant). It is the hardest thing in the world- and it should be. Raising my own animals for meat has changed the way I consume other meat (or rather, the way i DON'T consume other meat) unless I'm sure it has been handled, beginning to end, with the same care and concern that I give my animals.<p>Humane meat is possible without being elitist, expensive, and inhumane, and I take personally your accusation that there's any convenience in it. Attitudes like yours are just one more factor that a small farmer has to deal with in this uphill battle against backwards attitudes towards meat raising and I'd appreciate it if you'd cool it on the propaganda!",1365433184

With 100s of millions of domestic people-flights a year we're bound to see a small number of absurd events, like airline employees in a bad mood (not uncommon) pushed over the edge by virtually nothing. Of course I'm not defending the ridiculous removals, but I'm trying to put it into perspective.<p>I flew a lot as a child in the 80s, and every now and then I'd see someone kicked off a flight. It was usually for drunkedness, but my point is the right to remove a passenger at the airline employee's discretion has existed for decades. I know Seinfeld is fiction, but there's a pretty funny episode from 1995 where the pilot kicks seinfeld off a flight because seinfeld had kicked him out of his comedy show earlier that weekend.",1365433170

I can see how maybe some outdated code or a bunch of hacks could make a site designed for IE6 look just a little funny here and there but I don't see how it would be a lot of work at all to make a site made for IE6 work in a modern browser. As far as I know, the only reason large companies don't upgrade is because they have a bunch of infrastructure that's totally unrelated to websites that stop them from upgrading. Basically, the IT department sets up the entire company's computer systems a certain way and then resist upgrading anything so they don't have to do a lot of testing, more patching, and generally adapt to the new tech after they've tuned their infrastructure just so.",1365433091

All navigation to domains outside the allowed list would trigger the default (modern) browser to open the link instead.<p>This effectively would make IE6 not a web browser, but just another <i>runtime</i> for ordinary installable software, which just happens to run mostly by loading external code from the web. (Sort of like node-webkit, actually.) Microsoft could re-brand it, with their usual flare, as the ""Legacy Intranet Services Application Framework"", and tout it as a ""transition tool"" for any enterprise ""lagging behind.""<p>All the people needing IE6 for something could safely upgrade to a new OS, knowing their old web-apps would continue working for as long as LISAF is supported; and all the people developing for the web would be released from the burden of seeing IE6 <i>outside an Intranet</i> ever again.",1365433053

5512052,comment,5511815,5511815,25,0,mindcrime,,,"I'm sorry, but this whole article is based on a completely unfounded premise - that being the premise that you're not ""committed"" to your startup unless you've quit your dayjob and are working on the startup fulltime. But there's no basis for asserting that, and it is - quite simply - not true.<p>It's not ""shooting yourself in the foot"" to work on a startup while working a dayjob, it's called ""funding your startup with your dayjob salary"". And if you don't have a pile of capital just lying around waiting to be spent, or aren't (interested in|willing to|able to) raise outside capital, it's essentially your only choice.<p>And why exactly should I care about ""stringing along my present employer""? I show up, do the work I'm asked to do, and they pay me some amount in return. What I do on my time is my business.. If my performance drops, they are welcome to fire me. If anything, this should be seen as a call for employers to recognize their entrepreneurial minded employees and find a way to leverage their talent to do something entrepreneurial <i>within</i> that firm. Better yet, invest in the employees startup and tell them to get out and work on it fulltime. Now that's a win-win for everybody.<p>But don't think you get to call who is or isn't a ""real entrepreneur"" based on who has or hasn't quit their dayjob. If anything, the folks doing it ""the hard way"" deserve more respect and recognition than the people running around acting like raising a round was an end unto itself, and who seem to think that the point of a startup is to raise money (as opposed to making money).",1365433048

There's a relationship between the <i>number of expected hashes per new block</i> and the difficulty. That tells you <i>something</i> about the hash rate, but not the rate itself. Actually, it tells you something about the <i>number</i> of <i>unique</i> hashes being tried per new block (in expectation). And for some applications, that may, in fact, be what you care about.<p>Specifically, the appearance of new blocks is, if you like, a random variable with an exponential distribution. You can, in principle, estimate the rate parameter for this distribution using the difficulty and the timestamps in the Bitcoin log, but it's not straightforward. The last time I got into it, I was halfway through building a Bayesian estimator for the rate parameter using the log before I had to give up and move on to real work. I'll do it soon.",1365432995

store of value. When bitcions are bought, people are
transfering ""real"" value (USD or any other government backed
currency) into the Bitcoin system where the value is being
held. When they sell Bitcoins they are removing value from the
system.  Due to supply (limited) and demand (increasing), the
amount real currency needed to purchase a unit of Bitcoin is
going up.  This transfer of value can be due to hopes of
appreciation (speculative investment, possibly causing a bubble)
or lack of faith in a base currency (hedging wealth, as is
happening in Europe).<p>Since our monetary systems are now based on little more than
unbacked faith and look to be failing in various ways, people are
looking to put their wealth into something they feel they can
trust and that might have more of a future than current fiat
systems. Given the decentralized lack of control of Bitcoin and
the rise in the current lack of trust in the offical financial
systems, the rise of Bitcoin makes as much sense as the present
rise in the value of gold, a traditional hedge of value and
original currency backer. Now that people are now used to storing
value in non-backed, faith based monetary systems, Bitcoin is the
first fiat monetary system that has no ruler, and people are
transfering their government backed faith based store of value
into it. It can be thought of a democratic store of value, and as
more people believe in it the more value it will have.",1365430773

""Currency"" is a really, really big word, but at its heart, currency is any medium of exchange. There are myriad microcurrencies that are out on the market now, of which Bitcoin is just one.<p>However, the difference is that Bitcoin has been primarily commoditized. People aren't using Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, by and large. They're trading dollars for Bitcoins in a hope to get more dollars back in the future. That's an investment in an asset, not a currency trade.<p>Now, to confuse things further, there is a FOREX market which allows you to (if you so chose) speculate on currency.  By and large, these currencies fluctuate within the FOREX based on their respective purchasing power at that time (there's a <i>lot</i> that goes into this--I'm simplifying). The thing that makes the FOREX unique is that you can trade any currency with any currency in it. It's not a commodity market, wherein you need to sell your commodity to trade for another one.<p>Bitcoin <i>wants</i> to be a currency, but <i>is</i> a commodity. Until it becomes a viable (viable in the sense of macro-level use and acceptance) medium of exchange, it will only be a commodity.

But ""Trade secret law is grounded in unfair competition principles, ... [so] First Amendment defenses to trade secret claims are most likely to succeed as to those who did not participate in misappropriating the information, who acquired the information lawfully, and who seek to make public disclosures as to matters of public concern. In exceptional cases, preliminary injunctions may impinge on First Amendment rights even when defendants are in privity or have wrongfully acquired the information.""<p>This isn't just ""what's your secret method for cheaply polishing ball bearings."" It's clearly a ""matter of public concern,"" and that does help enormously. But your first amendment claims would improve even more if the person distributing the information neither trespassed nor broke an employment contract.<p>Also note that the California Supreme Court has made it a jurisdiction least likely to apply first amendment to trump trade secret law, thanks to DVD Copy Control v. Bunner.<p>It would be advisable for any prospective documentarians to pass off any collected information to a local news station (rather than just youtube). Don't tell the network how you got it or develop any long term relationship with them. Make sure they have media liability insurance. Then maybe lay low while they fight the case, which they'll probably have to appeal all the way up. That'd set up the model case and the money to fund it.<p>Even short of that, though, as a ""matter of public concern,"" this may be one of those ""exceptional cases"" alluded to above.

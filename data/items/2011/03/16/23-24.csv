2334465,comment,2333276,2333276,0,0,reduxredacted,,,"My advice from the perspective of a remote worker:<p>Rule #1: Communicate directly, precisely, and clearly.<p>It's not about how <i>hard</i> someone works, when you're managing remote workers, in that it's not about how many hours (to be clear: too few or too many).  You have absolutely no way to micromanage their time, so you must set expectations at the project level.  ""Feature/Component X needs to be done by day Y, and if that deadline is going to slip you need to let me know as soon as you see that happen so that I can plan accordingly.""  You might have someone who gets Feature X done on day one and slacks off the rest of the time.  But you got what you wanted.<p>If you expect them to be available and contactable at certain times of the day, state it clearly.  If you don't care <i>as long as the job gets done</i>, don't hold them to certain hours and state that clearly.<p>Rule #2: Remote workers, especially ones who are new to working remotely, can tend to feel ""left out"" or ""lonely"".  This is, in my opinion, the equivalent of the manager of remote workers feeling like their workers are not completing work in a timely enough fashion.  In an office environment where you can toss a piece of paper at your boss, you can get constant feedback.  In a remote environment, that's impossible to replicate completely and dangerous to try to replicate for people who write software (where interruption kills productivity).  Whenever there is a lack of communication, both parties tend to jump to the worst possible conclusion.  The manager assumes the employee is being lazy, the employee assumes his manager is incapable of handling remote workers and is looking to fire him at any moment (so some of that slack time is spent getting the resume together and shopping it at alternative places of employment).  Back to Rule #1.<p><i>I know it could be a motivation problem ... maybe I just need to challenge them on their speed...</i><p>Yes, but do it by giving them clear deadlines, not by questioning their lack of motivation.  When the work is completed <i>properly</i> and on-time, ask for feedback about the deadline to ascertain if you were being too reasonable or very unreasonable.  When it slips, say these words: ""What do I need to do differently to ensure you can reach the deadline next time?""  This is a nice trick.  If your developer says ""nothing, I just needed more time"", you can carefully launch into questions about (1) whether or not they have the right skill-set, (2) if they're having difficulties with the remote work arrangement and how that can be solved.  You sound like a pretty decent guy who would give his employees a good deal of slack if they're <i>just a little slower</i>.  Work that angle a little bit, but be careful to not allow that to be something that can be taken advantage of.<p>Consider a Skype video call on occasion.  Video calls just ""feel"" more connected.<p>Just to add a little perspective to my advice:<p>I work remotely.  Three days in a remote office, two days from home.  My bosses have ranged from being on different continents to being as close as six hours drive away.  My ""remote office"" is 7 people, none of which work in my division.  I was new to working remotely six years ago, prior to which I had a ""boss two cubicles over"" sort of working arrangement.  It took a little while to adjust, but I had a very good manager who who managed both his local and remote employees this way (some of his staff start work at 5:00 AM, some start at 10:00 AM, he doesn't care as long as <i>the work gets done</i>).  I also write software all day, sometimes as part of a team, sometimes as a lone developer.  So use that when deciding to take my advice.  My situation may not fit with your circumstances.",1300319008

Better: this one involves unacceptable risks derived from inadequate engineering. A nuclear reactor that requires an external source or energy to dissipate the (prodigious amount of) energy it generates after shut down is stupid. Sorry to all engineers involved in this, but I can't find another word. Maybe adequate cooling would make the reactor cost twice as much. Maybe it would take up too much space. Or maybe it would require the reactor to be impossibly compact. Or big. I don't care. If it doesn't work (and it's quite clear this one isn't) it's because the design is not ready. It may not be your fault - it may be so due to what the client demanded, both in cost and space constraints, but that's what professional ethics are for.

You have criticized my approach without understanding it.<p>> Specifically, two programs that parse the same grammar would likely need to do different things at different times in the parsing process. [...]  But any ""general purpose"" parser library more or less has taken the code and fully compile it - turn it into an AST or the equivalent and then let the programmer deal with the results<p>Actually, that's not what Gazelle does.  If that were the best you could do, I'd agree with you.<p>At its lowest layer, Gazelle offers <i>event-based</i> parsing.  It's like SAX, where the approach you have described is like DOM.<p>The way you would remove a single ""i"" tag from a string is by registering a callback that gets called when ""i"" is encountered, and another callback that gets called when the corresponding closing tag is encountered.<p>And once I've optimized Gazelle to generate really fast machine code, I doubt your ""single loop"" is going to beat me.  For example, did you know that with SSE you can do 16 byte-wise compares in a single instruction?  Are you going to put SSE instructions in your ""single loop""?<p>Finally, your ""single loop"" is probably not going to correctly handle the case where the ""i"" tag is inside a CDATA section, and is therefore not actually an ""i"" tag at all.  This is the biggest problem with ad hoc parsers -- nobody seems to realize how incomplete/buggy they are.<p>> Wait! People write programs manually too instead of automatic program constructors. It might be OK.<p>I think a better analogy would be: you would know C compilers weren't good enough if people were always writing in assembly instead.  Writing a parser manually instead of using an abstraction like a CFG is like writing in assembly language.",1300318295

2334380,comment,2334311,2334311,0,0,swampplanet,,,"No its not. Right now our corporate tax rate is 2nd only to Japan. What is happening is corporate flight from the US. I get emails every day proclaiming the low tax rates of Costa Rica and Panama. Heck even the UK's rate is almost half the US. Ad to that certain states like California and New York. So not only do the wealthy get taxed personally but also on their businesses. This is double taxation.<p>When the top 5% of the population pay over 80% of the taxes it is ludicrous to say they have a low tax burden. This doesn't even get into the question of lower taxes for capital. Perhaps if we looked at the entitlements which are growing all the time as this article points out, we would see why the tax burden is too large for everyone. (well not the 50% who pay no taxes at all).<p>The real deficit debate is how big of a government do we need not if the rich are paying their fair share. That debate is over, they pay more much more than their fair share.",1300317172

2334363,comment,2333469,2334239,0,0,zmmmmm,,,"My interest in Go stems from its potential to replace C as a systems programming language.   Basically, it seems like everything that has been tried for improving upon C has failed.   However this is not because C doesn't have problems, rather it's because every replacement has been trying to achieve other things at the same time and has introduced complexities that made things worse.<p>So I think it's interesting to have a language that is finally being built with the primary purpose of being better than C at systems programming.   My main issue however is the lack of support for Windows.  One of the main points of a system language and the reason C dominates is that with enough hacks you can make it portable to anywhere.  I can understand the Go folks probably don't have much interest in or use for Windows (or resources to support a port) but honestly, in my mind that's just incompatible with the stated goal of being a ""systems programming language"".",1300316870

I remember when you first came and floated the idea, and the top comments were that g0atbutt was a ridiculous name for a tech reporter.  You ignored all that talk AND GOT IT DONE!!<p>Talk is cheap.  Anyone could SAY they are going to compete with Google, Facebook, or the whatever the biggest player in the game is.  It's a whole lot harder to do it.  You came out and boldly proclaimed that you were going to start an alternative to TechCrunch and you are well on your way to doing this.<p>My one constructive criticism is that you spend some time getting more comfortable with your interviewee and with yourself.  I've never met Andrew Warner but he's comes off as being very charismatic while being genuine at the same time.  I can't imagine anyone watching him and not liking the guy.  Part of this is probably his natural personality, but a big role is because he also comes EXTREMELY prepared to his interviews.<p>I don't have any tips for you on increasing your charisma, but I will say that your on air persona is an important part of your brand/product and there's a certain something that's missing there although I can't name it.<p>I expect to see you reaching greater and greater levels each month!<p>Go GoatButt!",1300316827

The problem with the ""release everything"" approach is that there is so much data generated every day that it would be impossible for anyone to make sense of it.  When journalists or other non-technical people try to analyze raw data or scientists' communications on their own they are very likely to mis-interpret or emphasize the wrong things.",1259539199

It just does the things it wants to do without following any directives from Microsoft or being afraid of what Microsoft might do. Go ahead and use Windows, that's fine. Google supports it with their products -- and sometimes, supports it first, and exclusively. Look at the Chrome browser. If lowering the cost of a laptop by $50 means more people can have one, then that's good for Google -- more (potential) users. It's not about hurting Microsoft at all. Similarly, if very capable, open-platform phones are the norm, there's more ""mobile internet users"".

In the past we had ""yo your family didn't share anything this week, share some stuff"" emails every week. We analyzed it and it generated a lot of pageviews. I thought it was complete rubbish, since it was annoying to get one of these a week; Jason thought it was great for getting traffic. We're still not sure how to deal with the activity problem, but we're looking into it.<p>> <i>- The biggest complaint is ease of use. Many members have left the comment ""Enter a comment..."" because they clicked the ""Add Comment"" button before entering their text.

That's interesting. Perhaps we'll underline the family name and see how well that works. The only ways this won't work is in special cases like weekly emails or something.<p>> <i>- Although it's possible to attach text to a picture, it's not apparent how to attach text to an album, or if you even can.</i><p>Like a description thing? We wanted to keep it simple, but this is a pretty valid oversight. Adding.<p>> <i>- People have figured out how to post pictures or text, but not both in the same posting.</i><p>Hmm.

You might want to consider a giant sign, ""In order to come back here to Ramamia, just click any link in any email from us.""</i><p>Good idea.

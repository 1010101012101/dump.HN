I'm happy to sit down with them for a few hours and do some basic work, but put the burden on them. It works great for me, because I get to do a little design education, still get paid, and focus my time on more lucrative projects. It also can pay dividends when clients come back to me later for more work or other design changes.<p>To put it in a more uncouth way, 99Designs and WooThemes take the pain-in-the-ass clients and get them out of the way.

When you narrow the search, you find established values.  Digitized classics go for $0.99.  Novels are about $9.  Textbooks are similar to their dead-tree counterparts, at $60+.  Serious reference works can be thousands.<p>Run of the mill technical books clock in in the $20 to $40 range.  I'd aim for that, and go high or low within there.   And as a new author covering a widely-known process like agile, (opposed to the landmark work on a popular language), low would probably be best.<p>How much the book saves a business is immaterial.

In a consumer's mind, why wouldn't then _everything_ else, including the Marketplace apps, be free. It doesn't help matters that Rovio's runaway blockbuster cultural gamechanger shared timesink app Angry birds is free on Android (albeit with ads).<p>2) The blatant, flagrant, rampant, money-maker shaking heaps of copyright theft and IP violations that make it to the top of the Marketplace lists.

How could I entrust my credit card with a service that allows GPL violators and copyright flouters to rise to the _very tippy top_ of the charts?

You have an Ideal Customer Profile.<p>Then you say, they will need my product when they do z. Those are the triggers. Meaning person has problem and knowledges problem and is actively looking for solution and at the set of a trigger they will do this.<p>So that now moves us into demand harvesting stage caused by a trigger (not demand generation which is missionary convincing a person they have a problem).<p>All good. Now all that was easy. The real hard part is reach. How will you find these folks?<p>Google is not enough. How will you access the hubs, the well connected early adopters to try your product/service and do word of marketing/referral for you for free?<p>I find in most of my sales jobs, reach is always the issue. Marketing is usually clueless. So I need to usually figure out clever ways to identify and reach this market.<p>Example from a recent consulting job. Mechanic wants to focus on Minivans since they are constantly used and constantly need repairs.\nOk who drives minivans: moms.<p>Ok which moms will be hubs early adopters? Moms that are on committees that will tell others so that will we will get word of mouth.<p>How to we do reach these moms - through their hair stylists.\nWhat. Huh.<p>To go after your hub early adopters you need to find the people they will listen to and trust.<p>These high influential moms that will tell other moms are usually in charge of groups and constantly need to maintain their appearance. They regularly go to salons. They trust their hair stylist more than they trust their husbands.<p>Great: We designed a campaign to have hair stylists at select locations to try the mechanic's services at a deep discount. Immediately after trying our services, we gave them discounted coupons to give to 1 or 2 of their clients.<p>Then the these high connected (more like switches than hubs since they become to a number of groups) early adopter moms a chance to try us and subsequently tell their friends. Essentially the clairol commercial tactic with a twist.<p>Hope this helps. No time to make it shorter.<p>tldr: pick the one that easiest to reach the well-defined market that can purchase your product/service. And that has easily identifiable highly connected early adopters. This will make marketing easier and actually doable.",1301939173

2407566,comment,2405579,2405579,3,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"The article is part of an old problem:  How to connect 'research' with 'business'.<p>I respond with:<p>(I) Summary.<p>(II) Details on Reasons for Failure.<p>(III) Examples of Solutions.<p>(IV) Opportunity.<p>below.<p>(I) Summary.<p>Quite generally, there are many ways to make a mess and fail, and this is true also in connecting research with business and has a very long history.<p>There is also a long history of success connecting research with national security, public health, and business.<p>Net, the main issue is, are results of research really wanted outside of research?  The usual answer is, ""Not only no but hell no!"", and that's the main reason for failure.<p>(II) Details on Reasons for Failure.<p>One level deeper, the main reason people outside of research don't want research is that they feel threatened:  They would rather just keep doing things the same old way that has been doing well for them (people not doing well can't afford research!) and not risk it by being 'upstaged' or 'disrupted' by research.<p>Also a researcher with good access inside a successful business organization can be seen as a 'loose cannon on the deck' that might understand the 'secrets' of the success of the business, use research to find a better way, and start a competing business.<p>The usual situation in business is:  (1) Organize like at Ford 100 years ago where the supervisor knows more and the subordinates are just to apply labor to the ideas, direction, and work of the supervisor, (2) pay everyone relatively little, thus, making sure no one feels free to take any risks at all, (3) evaluate everyone on very narrow criteria of getting the present work done with severe consequences for any deviations and, thus, for anything new, ensure no upside and a lot of downside, (4) for anything new inside the organization, kill it off ASAP, (5) for anything very new or advanced outside the organization, f'get about it.<p>So, net, the only one in the organization with any freedom to do anything new is the CEO, and generally he is too busy just running the existing business and not technical enough to do or supervise anything like 'research'.<p>Inside a business research lab, usually the goals are at best a mess.  So, the path to the business bottom line is not wanted or not clear, but the usual academic criteria do not apply either.<p>So, without good criteria, the organization is vulnerable to the long, standard list of organizational dysfunctionalities.  E.g., the place can become a 'caste' system where the head guys defend themselves with 'cliques' based on incompetence, race, gender, ethnicity, etc., and all the non-manager ""worker bees"" are expected to keep quiet and out of sight and maybe just publish papers or patents.<p>So, usually big business organizations just will NOT 'innovate'.  This is a problem, but its 'flip side' is an opportunity central to 'Hacker News'!<p>(III) Examples of Solutions.<p>Again, one of the crucial points is for the people in the business actually to want the results of research, and at times there have been solutions at AT&T Bell Labs, DoD, NIH, CDC, etc.<p>One solution has been illustrated at Renaissance Technologies run by Jim Simons:  He is a good mathematician (Chern-Simons), long Chair of the math department at SUNY Stony Brook, and at Renaissance sometimes paid himself $2 billion or so a year.  Once the Brookhaven National Lab people wanted to collide some gold atoms to create a 'quark plasma', couldn't get the money they needed, so Simons wrote them a check, maybe $20 million or so.  So, he wanted the results of research, had a reputation for hiring mathematical physicists from Russia, and was not threatened.<p>Another example has been Westvaco Paper:  They specialized in 'specialty papers', e.g., milk cartons and table tops.  Basically they have regarded themselves as an 'applied chemical engineering' company.<p>They had a research lab between DC and Baltimore:  Each six months the lab submitted its budget to the NY HQ, and HQ always wanted to increase the budget, and Research always said, ""No."".<p>Why?  My old notes have:<p>(1) The research group worked only on problems of their own choice and did not accept problems assigned to them.  Generally in research, problem selection is both important and difficult, and here the real experts did the problem selection.<p>(2) Projects started by the research group ran from about two months to about two years.  Only about one project in ten led to an implementation.<p>(3) When research believed they had a project worthy of implementation, they would approach the General Manager (GM) of the appropriate operating group and make their proposal.  The decision to implement was up to the GM.  Here we see some the importance of having the business organization involved in the implementation.<p>(4) If an implementation was made, then the financial value was measured by careful auditing.<p>(5) For the first three years of implementation, half the financial improvement was credited to the operating group and the other half to research.  After the first three years, all the improvement was credited to the operating group and none to research.  Also, the GM's bonus could be affected by these results.  It did help that most of the GM's were Ph.D.'s in chemical engineering.<p>(6) With these rules, the research group returned to the company, long run, about three dollars for each dollar in their budget.<p>So, that's one way to run an industrial research lab.<p>(IV) Opportunity.<p>For the 'Hacker News' community, the flip side of the sad, old situation is a new opportunity:<p>(1) Find a problem where a much better solution should lead to big bucks.<p>(2) Have the founder, CEO do some research to get a much better solution, good enough to be much better than anything else and advanced enough to be difficult to duplicate or equal and, thus, provide a good 'technological barrier to entry'.<p>Note:  IMHO, for the relevant research for 'information technology' the key is not 'computer science' but selected, advanced topics in pure and applied math.<p>(3) Implement the solution in software and offer it to users via the Web or cloud.<p>(4) Buy a nice yacht, rinse, and repeat.<p>For the research part, the main training for research is the Ph.D.  The difficulty of Ph.D. programs shows that learning how to do good research and doing it are not easy.  Thus, hopefully, the founder, CEO doing the research has a good, relevant Ph.D.  This way, no one in the organization is threatened by the research that helps start the organization.<p>Once again, the ways big organizations find to make messes can be corrected by entrepreneurship.<p>So, don't curse the big organizations.  Instead, use their problems as an opportunity to be a successful entrepreneur and buy a yacht.",1301938581

His strategy is weak because he's trying to hit a home run at his first at bat while learning the game. His understanding of the economics involved is very weak because not only does he not know how to price his book he states ""You have to have a good editor and some good, knowledgeable friends who are willing to severely criticize your work."" So he doesn't recognize (or perhaps he does but hasn't internalized it) the value that is brought to the book by the editor (who quite reasonably might want a cut, just like the back up band gets paid if they help you do an album :-)<p>I suspect he may end up bitter and disillusioned if he is not careful.<p>A 'healthy' way to work this would be to write the equivalent of articles on the areas that he is a subject matter expert in, that are short 1500 - 2500 words. Something that can help him develop his writing voice and let him seek out and evaluate the effectiveness of various authors. Self publish these for free or a modest sum (like $0.99). The goal of this stage is to build up an understanding of what it will take to actually write your books.<p>Next once he has some experience and a good set of tools take take the top 10 articles he self published and organize them with a greater structure and updated to the current standards as a 'composition' book. This, if he has any audience at all, he can sell for $3 - $5. Surprisingly to some, but people will buy his articles again when they are put into this format. (magazines do this all the time they sell 'best of' books from magazine articles). He will also pick up new readers by word of mouth with other folks.<p>Not guaranteed of course, he may find that his writing is not well received.

2407559,comment,2402817,2406134,2,0,rosenjon,,,"I agree that IP belongs in a category of its own. Real property ownership lasts effectively forever. Intellectual property, in the form of patents, are temporary monopolies under the current system. So there are already distinctions.<p>It is indeed difficult to decide what is truly ""innovative"" or ""new"". The patent system defines the criteria for issuing a patent as novel, non-obvious, and useful. These are very broad standards, and were much more applicable to physical invention than information technology invention.<p>In my opinion, the patent system needs an update for the 21st Century. Those involved in developing software and information based technologies need to collaborate on a set of rules that set a high bar for issuing a patent, and a set of guidelines that streamline the application process for the U.S. Patent Office. The issues involved are usually highly technical, and rather than have a bunch of software engineer working in the patent office, it would make sense to force the applicant to prove via the application process that the product deserves protection.<p>Personally, I think that pure software should be copyrighted, not patented. If there are hardware and software components, that is the only time that a patent should be considered. Ditto with genetics. You should not be able to patent the information for a gene. It may be reasonable to patent the tools used to discover genes, assuming they are not straight derivatives of naturally occurring enzymes.",1301938491

And when it goes wrong (you reach whatever your limit is) then things tend to fail in less than ideal ways.  Tools around memory usage are also quite poor, so while performance gets optimized memory seldom does.  And a culture of cavalier memory usage doesn't help either -- too many people are borrowing memory to get performance, compounded in the case of an application that is typically an aggregation of many people's work.<p>The amount of code involved in systems is also continuing to go up, so that the amount of memory you use before you've done anything (but when you've loaded up all the code) is getting constantly higher.  In the world of static/compiled languages this might not be as notable as there's a clear sense of ""code"" and ""data"" -- Python has no such distinction, so if you don't share anything then you don't share <i>anything</i>.<p>WRT speed-vs-latency -- definitely related, but most benchmarking seems to specifically remove latency from the benchmark and instead test throughput.  E.g., tests frequently throw away the slowest run, even though abnormally slow runs exist in real programs and can have an effect.

I learned Photoshop and got pretty decent with it in terms of what I could do, although I was far from able to design anything beautiful.<p>Then I learned there is a much better way for us developers: buying templates.<p>If what you want is to have a decent design for your site, but you can't afford or don't want to wait for a professional designer, buying templates is the <i>best</i> thing you can do. You can get a beautiful-looking template for as little as $10-$20 dollars, and they'll be much better than you could hope to accomplish with limited time.<p>Also, if you're looking to just throw up a website quickly, I'd look into getting it set up with WordPress + a commercial template. It will take you 3 hours to get a beautiful-looking website up on the net, and you can always copy the design (and the design's code) if you want to make a web-app with the same theme. This is what I use for all my sites - a quick WordPress site with a theme from WooThemes, and a web-app (sitting on a subdomain) with the same theme, copied from the original template.<p>Resources:<p>WooThemes - beautiful and very easy to use themes for WordPress (and a few other CMS', I believe). <a href=""http://www.woothemes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.woothemes.com/</a><p>ThemeForest - also great themes, available for WordPress or as just plain html/css/js files you can play with. <a href=""http://themeforest.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://themeforest.net/</a><p>ThemeForest Admin Templates - I just learned about this one. ThemeForest templates, but that are specifically designed to serve as an ""administration interface"" for a webapp. In other words, if you're building a web application, these themes have <i>everything</i> you need. I haven't used one yet, but I'll definitely be buying a theme from here the next time I build a webapp. <a href=""http://themeforest.net/category/site-templates/admin-templates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://themeforest.net/category/site-templates/admin-templat...</a><p>Oh, by the way, if you're interested in learning Photoshop just for fun, I really recommend the Lynda videos - <a href=""http://www.lynda.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lynda.com/</a>.",1301937584

2407448,comment,2406335,2407151,1,0,drallison,,,"Growing plants to burn is a renewable energy source (or can be).  The plants grow, using energy from sunlight to convert CO2 from the atmosphere into burnable material and oxygen.  This burnable material, can later be burned to generate energy.  Fossil fuels release CO2, the carbon for which which has been sequestered from a previous era.  Since CO2 levels have been rising, it is clear that the ability of the plants to re-sequester the carbon from the released CO2 has been exceeded.<p>When comparing the costs of nuclear versus other energy sources, it helps to consider the cost per kilowatt from each source and to include all of the impacts.  For example, what is the cost of coal fired electricity generation?  What is the cost, in human lives, of acid rain? of decreased fisheries, of pollution, of global warming, and so forth.  I believe, when you consider all of the costs--economic and social--that nuclear power comes out pretty well compared to conventional fossil fuel generation.   I also believe that many of the so-called sustainable renewable energy sources, when critically examined over their full lifetime, do not fare well against convention sources.",1301937360

MVP (Model View Presenter) has been in vogue in the GWT world lately, as a result of Ray Ryan's seminal Google I/O presentation in 2009 and all of the open source projects spawned by it that attempt to reify the patterns therein (one of which is MVP).<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/events/io/2009/sessions/GoogleWebToolkitBestPractices.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/events/io/2009/sessions/GoogleWebToolk...</a><p>As presented by Ray, the diagram of MVP shows that the view never speaks directly with the model object, and always uses the presenter as an intermediary.<p>I wonder, what is the difference between this idea and how MVC is practiced in the Cocoa universe?  The present article talks about how it (Cocoa) uses the mediator pattern to accomplish the same thing.<p>Look, for example, at the diagrams in the fairly famous Stanford CS193P lectures:  (the Lecture 1 PDF at the top of the following page)<p><a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/downloads-2010-fall"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/download...</a><p>If you go to page  38 in the slides, or therabouts, you see a fully dressed-out diagram of how MVC is practiced in iOS, including all of the various communication mechanisms that the view uses to get to the model via the controller as a mediator.  (Even the event bus, NSNotificationCenter, is used as a channel between the model and the Controller - not between the model and the view.  Same with KVO.)<p>Incidentally, there is a Stack Overflow question discussing this very conundrum, and I don't feel that any of the current answers are very compelling.<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/353646/design-patterns-for-apples-cocoa-frameworks-mvc-mvp-passive-view-where-is"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/353646/design-patterns-fo...</a><p>To me, Cocoa MVC smells like MVP.

The internet is a wonderful place.<p>1. Indeed, Gladwell pushes the idea of a 10,000 hour goal quite heavily to the point he seems to want to make it a mantra.\n2. I understand Gladwell's point much more so now than when I wrote this piece two years ago (Jan. 6, 2009).<p>There was a comment last month (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2262619"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2262619</a>) about using an annual calendar to encourage yourself to work on a task (or whatever). I went out and got one and have been using it as suggested in the Seinfeld article.<p>After a month, with most of the days ""x'ed"" out, I realized the important correlation between a dedication to routine to get better (or even the best?) at something.

I refuse to believe that ""bright"" and ""very bright"" individuals are in the range mentioned in the article.  Maybe the ""dumbing down"" of society has been instituted  through the mindless activities that humanity participates in like watching t.v. or movies.<p>As social networks have taken over the internet, live social interaction has diminished as well.  Humans need live social interaction for personal development, they don't need to see/view social interaction on t.v., in a movie, or online.  There is neurological reaction that occurs when you meet someone for the first time.  This can not be duplicated through viewing/obtaining the action from the outside.  There is an electrical transference the occurs when shaking someone's hand, or giving them a hug that cannot be obtained through ""poking"" someone online.<p>I agree with the article that drug use by more intellectual people would be higher in the fact that there is no escaping the mind.

I hear what you say, and that's an important consideration when translation this to the real world.  You can get the same short-cut performance by adding a single line:<p><pre><code>    int find(int a[], int size, int val) {
        if (size<=0) return -1;
        int lower = 0, upper=size;
        while (upper-lower>1) {
            int m = lower+(upper-lower)/2;
          
     ->     if (val==a[m]) return m;       <- Inserted line

            if (val<a[m]) upper = m;
            else          lower = m;
        }
        return (val==a[lower]) ? lower : -1;
    }

  > Binary search has poor cache locality of reference.

Absolutely, and for that reason there are many variants that can be devised, and then tuned for different cache considerations.  I remember writing a version that measured the system cache performance every hour or so and adapted its parameters accordingly.",1300981341

2364513,comment,2364263,2364433,0,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>Something I've always wondered: assuming all other things (connections, community, alumni, funding, etc.) being equal, does YC win out over other ""incubators"" simply because of Hacker News?</i><p>There are at least two ways the HN online community could provide an advantage to YC and the YC-funded companies. I will mention the one that is most salient to me first: it seems to me that HN is an interesting online community in its own right. The guideline for submissions<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p>that a submitted link should be one that ""gratifies one's intellectual curiosity"" raises the tone of discussion here and brings together a lot of smart people. That, in turn, provides the first introduction to the startup community and first introduction to YC to many readers. (I discovered HN, and then YC, by reading Paul Graham essays on pg's website, and occasionally following the link over to Hacker News. I don't have a strong enough tech background to contribute to many of the threads here, but I have gradually figured out which topics--mostly mass media reporting on science or education reform--are topics to which I can contribute based on my own personal background.) I tell young people I know who are interested in entrepreneurial, high-tech business opportunities about Hacker News. They learn here about YC. At least a few of the young people I know in my town are doing serious development (which leads to coding posted on GitHub) of software-as-a-service solutions for problems they encounter in their own work. They intend to seek out YC first when they have formed co-founder groups and developed a business proposal. So I think one YC advantage that derives from HN is that YC gets early proposals from a lot of highly motivated entrepreneurs who might not otherwise have even known about early-stage funding. And the YC application form discloses an applicant's HN user name, so HN users have the chance here to establish thoughtful reputations by their comments, and YC has the mutual chance to better understand its group of applicants through each applicant's behavior here, a win-win in adding information to the appplication process.<p><i>YC startups (quite rightly) get on the front page easily, which obviously drives a lot of traffic.</i><p>You were mentioning the issue of whether a YC-funded company tends to get more visibility here on HN. Reasonable minds could differ, but I actually think that the first advantage I mention above is more powerful than the advantage you mention in your question. YC-funded startups do get much visibility here on HN, but they are not alone in that visibility. People here upvote posts if they are interesting, whether the company is funded by YC or not. The submitted post makes clear that being visible here on HN is an advantage, because readers of HN include venture capitalists and other people in the industry who can help a new company make funding and market connections that will  help the company grow. But I think many of us, even those of us who are aware of which companies are YC companies and which are not, cheer on and upvote posts about any interesting new company (or new inchoate business idea), so the exposure advantage is not quite as strongly skewed toward YC companies.<p>I'd be glad to hear from other participants what they think about this.",1300981194

That's not an interesting question to ask.<p>The question worth asking is, how can I disambiguate between scenarios like startups being attracted to YC because of presumably greater access to HN's front page and HN creating startup founders who then go with YC as the path of least resistance? How do I distinguish between various possible correlations and causations?<p>(I can think of one obvious approach: survey YC-funded projects and see how many founders were on HN before they were founders, and how many got on HN after becoming founders/YC-funded.)",1300981176

When I went for jobs I was mainly interested in commission. However if the sale took long that is not good enough. You can have the commission stagger - matching the sales pipeline stages. This meaning - they get x for number of potentials in that have been qualified, y percentage for that have been demod, z for starting eval, p for finished eval, q for proposal, w for closed, and t for getting referrals. You get the idea.<p>Selling to big orgs is painful and time consuming. However if you can find something that they already are buying, partner with those folks since their sales reps are already in.<p>Always look for a personal stake when selling. The best way someone described it is like buying like you would do for yourself except it is someone else's money so even less diligence is needed. You have to work on literature to answer all the thoughts in their head that makes this a near risk free proposition. This means answering concerns from the CFO and how it compares with existing solution, and how to incorporate it so they get the full benefit.<p>I hate distributors in general. They do very little to make sales. Instead go with a value added reseller. They have the feet on the street. Plus if you treat the valued added resellers are you sales rep clones, they will sell and sell. Go for a reseller that is number 3 or 2 in the industry. They have something to prove. Then train the sales staff yourself. This means real practicing and providing excellent marketing collateral and support for questions. The marketing collateral does always ned to be fancy - remember they will not be fired for not using your product. Most places have inertia and they have more to lose than gain by switching to you no matter how much they save the company or make the company. Always find out how the switch will personally impact them - now they have real motivation.<p>PS in terms of English, I liked ""Niches to Riches"" book about benefits pieces. it is more B2C but remember folks are folks. It helped me tremendously. She is  PR consultant.<p>Another sales book recommendation if you in a established market:
The Wedge: How to Stop Selling and Start Winning

2364441,comment,2363628,2364327,0,0,trotsky,,,"Bernanke has regularly referred to ""Core Inflation"" when discussing inflationary pressures. You can see his use of it as recently as Feb 3, 2011 in his speech to the National Press Club: <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20110203a.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke2011...</a><p>The Fed's version of core inflation is the core PCE price index as you stated. The ""core PCE price index [...] excludes the more volatile and seasonal food and energy prices"" [1].<p>While you may reasonably take issue with my wording of ""quite narrow"" as I perhaps wasn't choosing my words carefully enough, core inflation/core PCE certainly isn't ""the most general measure of inflation that is theoretically possible"". I assume you weren't meaning to refer to ""core PCE"" - but never the less it is clear from federal reserve speeches that it is this measure that has been playing significantly into federal reserve monetary policy.<p>Core inflation makes sense in trying to smooth out seasonal or short term moves. However, the effects on global food and oil commodities that are traded in US dollars seem to far exceed any seasonal or short term influences. In that case discounting food and fuel influence on actual inflation rates seems unwise.<p>Bernanke seems to be acknowledging this. The WSJ reported on the 13th of March in an article titled ""To Avert Criticism, Fed Avoids Saying 'Core'"": <i>Now, Mr. Bernanke is taking another tack in his public communications. In two days of testimony on Capitol Hill earlier this month, the Fed chairman never uttered the words ""core inflation"" while explaining the central bank's aims and policies.</i> [2].<p>As a side note, as I've noted I'm in no way trying to put myself forward as an expert on these subjects. I get a significant amount of my financial news and analysis from the WSJ and Marketplace (public radio) (and Morgan coverage, which admittedly is not particularly hawkish here). I'm not above admitting that I could be making some serious mistakes, so if you'd like to suggest better sources of information I am all ears.<p>[1] <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Personal_cons...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704893604576198703033844010.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405274870489360457619...</a>",1300980194

It made sense - when you were worried or anxious or happy, you felt something right there.<p>Then later when medicine was invented, the heart was a pump. It moved, blood flowed, obviously its a pump.  Also not quite right - it also measures blood components, gives feedback to and accepts from the brain, has glands and enzyme responses - so lots more than a pump, more of a synthesis organ with many functions.<p>So now the brain is a computer. See, I was going somewhere with this!  And 'consciousness' is just an algorithm. Its obvious, especially to computer programmers.<p>I think that there is more going on than that.  Because when I'm asleep, somebody is not 'at the wheel', and when I'm awake I'm fully present and thinking, and sometimes thinking about thinking.<p>Behavioral algorithms can simulate this up the wazoo e.g. Watson, and what you have is a puppet, not something that is really thinking or conscious.<p>Oh, but they say, when we get a computer big enough/complex enough, it will spring into consciousness and then you'll see!  Talk about mystical thinking - if a big computer thinks, then a small one thinks but just smaller. And that is clearly not the case - I tried asking my pocket calculator what it was thinking, and it just said 5318008.

There's obviously no blinding (as he's subject and experimenter) which makes it almost certain that as he knows the hypothesis he's looking into and the measure is subjective, he's going to either subconsciously or consciously push the data towards proving or disproving it based on his preconceived ideas.<p>He talks about randomly choosing (possibly sloppy language but if you choose in any way it's not random, regardless it's not clear) and he's failed to adjust for or control any other variables that might influence sleep like, oooo, alcohol or caffeine or stress or a whole bunch of things that will make more of a difference than standing on one leg which given the relatively small data set is a pretty big deal (again some of this may depend on the method of randomisation).<p>And then the variation is within fractions of one percent (the scale showing 99 and 99.4) which given that the measure is subjective is essentially insignificant.<p>Please, please tell me that this is a wind up about how people believe anything scientific looking and trying to get people to stand on one leg for lulz rather than something serious?<p>Given that what he's doing is basically exercise and that linking sleep and exercise makes some sense, it's not a totally stupid hypothesis, but his experiment proves nothing.",1300979371

I guess the value is that he's found a simple workout that gets the results he needs in eight minutes a day with no equipment.<p>It would be interesting to find out if he would get better or worse results through cardio instead of working a muscle to exhaustion, and whether or not it is important that the legs be that muscle.  Some people suffer from restless legs syndrome which keeps them from achieving deep sleep, and maybe exercising the legs is countering this.<p>(I wish there was some way he could experiment that wasn't subject to the placebo effect, though, which makes the results moot when applied to anyone else.)",1300979302

There are far less risky ways for an exchange to rip off its customers with out their knowledge, such as front running.

You admit to the realpolitik of the TPP and you admit to how it is try to sabotage China&#x27;s self-governance (re. intellectual property, which they are MUCH better off without). But you aren&#x27;t doing so with the point of view of admitting the bad parts of the TPP. You actually think these are good things.<p>In fact, your entire post is downplaying the negative impacts of the TPP and trying to end on an up note &quot;it&#x27;s good! It&#x27;s necessary! &quot;Navigating future global financial and international policy options&quot;! &quot;Major strategic opportunities&quot;! You never list even one! Not even in this response. &quot;I believe that the TPP is important for the future economic viability of the United States.&quot; Not a single justification for that. You just keep repeating it, instead. That&#x27;s the Big Lie method. Keep repeating it until people start to believe it.<p>> I believe that the TPP is important for the future economic viability of the United States. I included some reasons why in that post, and also in other branches of the discussion. I would also be willing to discuss further here.<p>You included NO reasons in that post, and no reasons in this one, either. Eventually, in another post, you state that you think it will help &quot;the dollar, US bonds and Western financial institutions&quot;. Western financial institutions! Those are the people we want to help now? The people who caused the global economic crisis and got away with it richer than ever?<p>All of your posts in this thread fit a pattern. You respond to some criticism about the TPP, and you say &quot;I agree!&quot; Then you ignore it and say that the TPP is good. Every post. Repeating it. Repetition. The Big Lie.<p>If you agree with all of these criticisms, how can you then state that you think it&#x27;s a net positive? Wait, you say right here: &quot;It is, however, a keystone effort to establish a primary trade treaty in the region at a time it may be otherwise denied from.&quot; It almost seems like you think that ANY treaty in Asia would be a good thing. Any US influence at all. And you agree with all the criticisms, and they just don&#x27;t matter to you. Give up democracy and give up sovereignty, and give corporations their power over national governments. Who cares? We get a treaty out of it. And just getting that makes losing everything else worth it.<p>> Certainly I do not provide evidence in the prior post that single issue voting is harmful.<p>Being a single issue voter, while not without drawbacks, means that you can focus your vote on that single issue. And this issue is more important than <i>anything else</i> right now. So single issue voting on this one issue, if the voting is against it, is actually a very good thing.<p>You won&#x27;t agree with any of that, though, and I don&#x27;t care.

1. He had contacts because he was essentially a recruiter but working through the govt. (that got me a trial period leading to a full time job)   
2. He got me up and across town every Wednesday for 9am and told me a thousand times how smart I was gave me the confidence boost I needed to see through the jungle of BS that is jobhunting.<p>My point being: don&#x27;t negate any opportunities because they look bad at first glance.

This can be useful in providing correlation data across all visitors in aggregate, such as which browser you should make sure your site supports most of the time.<p>In other words, there exists some data in aggregate that is valuable to all of us, but the cost is a loss of privacy for smaller sets of personal data.<p>If individuals don&#x27;t want certain behaviors analyzed by others, then they shouldn&#x27;t use centralized services which exist outside their realm of control. These individuals would be better off using a &quot;website&quot; that is hosted by themselves, inside their own four walls, running on their own equipment. A simple way for SpiderOak to address this is to put their website on IPFS or something similar.<p>I appreciate the fact that SpiderOak is thinking about these things.

In the US, NBC airs a select few races in their entirety (Monaco, Canada, and the US GP), while NBCSN shows the rest of the races live as well as tape-delay full-race repeats.  NBC can be accessed over-the-air for free, but NBCSN is typically an add-on to a cable bundle, so you&#x27;re paying $60+/mo to have access to that channel for (if you&#x27;re only an F1 fan) at most 12 hours of content a month.",1449590018

As others have noted, for a company the size of ESPN the salaries of a few high profile personalities are mostly negligible.<p>2) Same thing with the Grantland shutdown -- the site was never realistically expected to be a money maker, it was essentially shut down because the departure of Simmons made the site&#x27;s future unclear, and ESPN decided to get out of the pop culture business and fold the sports writing back into their main site.<p>3) A lot of ESPN&#x27;s cutbacks are because they (foolishly) forecast their finances on the assumption that subscriptions would continue to grow.

Even with cable folding, those networks are still going to be paying billions for TV rights.<p>That said I agree with the overall gist of the argument that valuations are going to drop when the cable money starts drying out.

And no, what I said doesn&#x27;t support the claim of Gizi because showing someone can destroy or damage a company does not show they can run one excellently, or that a high paid CEO will run one better than someone who is willing to work that job for substantially less.<p>Here is an article that shows that higher pay only increases performance until a point, then performance drops:\n<a href=""http://eganassociates.com.au/high-ceo-pay-inspires-better-performance-until-it-doesnt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eganassociates.com.au/high-ceo-pay-inspires-better-pe...</a>\nThese results came from data that compared CEO remuneration to average employee remuneration.  This directly contradicts what Gizi was proposing, because the real world data shows a negative correlation between CEO pay and performance after a point.

Yet when things go well, the CEO gets bonuses for things that may have had nothing to do with them.  Random fluctuations are wrongfully attributed to CEOs, and they get hefty bonuses for it as well.

Or a Marlboro ad most people did not care to look at. Everyone could have just gone to the copy shop and hang it on their wall, but noone did so. It was not very valuable. Now Price enters the room. He does something simple, and people are willing to give him a lot of money for it. It&#x27;s not because of the original work, but because of his work.

Mozilla doesn&#x27;t have a fundamental problem with display advertising on the web, but we do have a problem with the privacy intrusions associated with invisible trackers.<p>This comment is not directed at you, but is a more general take from your statement. With the state of the web we&#x27;ve had for quite sometime, I think the distinction between advertising on the web and privacy intrusion doesn&#x27;t exist (barring very few exceptions). Most advertising platforms specialize in and indulge in privacy intrusions.<p>I know only of The Deck (deck network) that does not track users. And that&#x27;s used only in a minuscule amount of sites that most non-tech people may not even encounter it.<p>Additionally, advertising has also become very heavy (in terms of bandwidth), distracting (how many ads can you even show until it becomes irritating and impossible to get to the actual content?) and annoying (just stop it with the popup layers, prompts and auto-playing videos with or without sound).<p>The entire user experience is completely ruined on many sites because of the insane amount of ads present. Nobody seems to care about this aspect at least until they get hit by ad-blockers. Not even large and popular tech sites do anything about user tracking (Ars, I&#x27;m looking at you and other popular sites).<p>Even if they do care, some or many are unable to change things.

Fighting back with ad-blockers despite &quot;collateral damage&quot; is probably the best way forward since the ad industry is not really stopping and changing things effectively or quickly.",1449588195

Most large retailers only store the full credit card information for seconds while they process the transaction, when the transaction is complete it is discarded.<p>What the criminals are targeting is the card terminals themselves.

I just want to understand... why would a recruiter for a militant (likely illegal) organization use a government-owned public platform?<p>The only possible reason for a recruiter to join is if there are potential recruits there. With USPS, a recruiter would have the ability to send mail to John Doe or current resident. There is some kind of targeting available as well. But that is besides the point. The main problem is how do we get everyone to be on this new public platform?<p>I think if we can get enough people to sign up for this public platform, it could be feasible. There are still privacy implications of such a public utility though. When you connect to the service, it can keep track of at least your device ID (trivial with apps) and your IP address. Assuming everyone is on this service, the service could reliably track who you are with at what times.<p>I understand that there already exist &quot;shadow&quot; profiles for me on various networks . However, I do not like the idea of an online identity that is connected to my real, legal identity. what if someone else gets a hold of my account while I am away for a few days and starts posting pro Sinn Féin propaganda on it? Will I get flagged for terrorism? How do we know handle all these false positives?

You seem to want a perfect plan to go solar.<p>If you look at predictions for renewables from a few years ago you will find out that they are all - no matter who you asked - largely wrong. I remember that not that long ago nobody would have expected that prices for onshore wind and solar would go down so rapidly. On the other hand offshore wind was often praised as the tech that would make renewables cheap. The opposite has happened. Onshore wind and solar got cheaper in a speed that even the most outspoken renewable advocates hadn&#x27;t predicted, offshore wind is one of the most expensive ways to get renewable energy.<p>Basically today there is not a single country that largely relies on &quot;new&quot; renewables (wind + solar). Denmark comes close, but they are small and interconnected with neighbors that have a lot of water power capacity and pumped storage.<p>I think it is pretty much impossible to predict which techs will work out in a future grid that will need a lot more storage tech.

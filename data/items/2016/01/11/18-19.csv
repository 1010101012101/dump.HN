10882377,comment,10880694,10880694,0,0,camelNotation,,,"I think our difficulty comes from the fact that we are unable to admit how exceptional we are. There is a fad at the moment, and it&#x27;s been ongoing for a century or more, to assign a degree of banality to the biological classification of the human race.<p>The obvious problem we all have with this is that we are the ones doing the assigning. I&#x27;m reading articles like this on a machine designed and built by humans with, if nothing else, the ability to process mathematical equations at a speed far beyond any normal human ability. We do things that are so obviously exceptional and unique that to classify us alongside chimpanzees due to DNA similarities strikes us all as absurd (because it is).<p>When the article points out that you wouldn&#x27;t assign a separate genus to an animal just because it uses tools, they&#x27;re missing the fact that the difference between a bird using a stick to fetch a seed and one that doesn&#x27;t is absurdly simplistic relative to LANDING ON THE F--KING MOON. At some point, perhaps something that doesn&#x27;t factor in for other animals should be factored in for us due to the extreme amounts of difference between my DVR recorder and the special rock a chimp uses break open a nut.<p>To me, this comes across as biological tunnel vision. Since the differences between other animals fall into simpler categories like appearance and genetics, biologists don&#x27;t want to introduce something like &quot;behavior&quot; into the mix for fear of it complicating the process. The problem is that in the case of homo sapiens, behavior is an unbelievably big deal.",1452538772

10882368,comment,10874992,10874992,0,0,spion,,,"I think we haven&#x27;t completely figured out software development yet, and its a bit of a mess :)<p>Yes, this is typical of today&#x27;s software development process. The codebase may be good in terms of code quality, but it sounds like it doesn&#x27;t have the best architecture.<p>Unfortunately, good architecture is extremely hard. The architect has to really think about the problem and come up with abstractions that are simple, intuitive, orthogonal, self-consistent, universal, not overwhelming, programmable (not configurable) and stand the test of time<p>Simple -> means that abstractions should only represent one thing. A rule-of-thumb test is: if you ask yourself what does this abstraction do or define, it should be a single item (not a list)<p>Intuitive -> abstractions that resemble existing abstractions that are in common use, as well as things in the real world. (or in the problem domain) For example, its possible to reuse a File abstraction for many things. Another example, UI classes should mirror things that are shown on the screen; in simulations classes should mirror the things being simulated, and so on.<p>Orthogonal -> abstractions should either introduce new functionality, or combine multiple functionalities into one - never both at the same time. For example, a function that reads settings from environment variables then calls another function with those settings is often likely to benefit from split into 2 functions: one to read the variables and another to glue together readVariables and callOtherFunction.<p>Consistent -> an abstraction should have laws that are never contradicted (they&#x27;re factual, never changing), and users should only rely on those laws and no other properties. The best examples of this can be found in Haskell&#x27;s standard type class tree.<p>Universal -> an abstraction should apply to all cases where possible. E.g. all mappable things should be mappable in the same way (Arrays, Tasks, Observables, etc) and all parts of the program should be able to take advantage of that<p>Not overwhelming -> The human brain can keep track of up to 10 concepts at the same time. The architect should keep this in mind and properly compartmentalise abstractions in a way that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm. The fewer things you need to keep track of at the same time, the better.<p>Programmable, not configurable -> Whenever possible, good code is programmable, not configurable. For example, a chart plotting function could take  a detailed configuration object that contains a description on how to format the labels, e.g. { decimals: 1, units: {1: &#x27;m&#x27;, 1000: &#x27;km&#x27;}}, could allow the user to pass a formatting function that takes the number and generates the label text. The second one is always more flexible and extendable.<p>Some of these properties may sometimes be at odds at eachother.<p>A note about microservices: they&#x27;re popular because they enforce some of these properties somewhat: most small services are <i>simple</i>, the API (interface) is given some thought to make it <i>intuitive</i> and <i>consistent</i>, they nudge towards <i>orthogonality</i> as inter-service dependencies have a much higher cost and are therefore avoided... However they have some downsides (e.g. they favour <i>configurable</i> instead of programmable, as its somewhat hard to pass code to be called by the microservice)",1452538719

Roses are &quot;traditional&quot; on Valentine&#x27;s Day simply because they ship well. Really really well. Roses are practically indestructible, and can be grown in Kenya, go without water for a while and still look great when they&#x27;re rehydrated. Other flowers (Lisianthus, for example) don&#x27;t appreciate being tightly packed into boxes and living without/with little water while they&#x27;re hanging out in the dark.

Tor can&#x27;t rely on either of those circumstances: It&#x27;s prominent and breaking into it is a one-stop solution to attacking many valuable targets.<p>2) Many organizations with large amounts of resources, from state intelligence agencies to law enforcement to security vendors to ISPs, would like to find solutions to hacking Tor security inexpensively.<p>3) True security is very difficult and expensive. For Tor, this is taken to an extreme by #2. Does the Tor Project have the resources to implement bug-free software (e.g., the kind that flies passsenger planes)? Certainly not. Can they find and fix bugs as quickly as the attackers described above find and exploit them? Certainly not. I&#x27;m not criticizing them; they just don&#x27;t have the resources.<p>4) Assuming the underlying concept of onion routing is secure, there still are plenty of targets for attacks such as implementation and all the other code Tor relies on (e.g., almost all of Firefox for the Tor Browser, encryption algorithms, your OS, etc.). Attacking a Tor user doesn&#x27;t seem impossible.<p>Based only on the theorizing above, and not knowing about Tor&#x27;s actual implemenation, I fear that we&#x27;re lucky if Tor still is expensive to attack. Of course, any smart attacker with an exploit will publicly complain how hard Tor is to hack.",1452538321

Everything is a lot more simple than my traditional bank (Lloyds), they&#x27;ve clearly put a lot of effort into the app UX which I value. They&#x27;re very responsive, both via support channels, and on the discourse forum we&#x27;re all in.<p>There are a few issues. One is a tradeoff which can&#x27;t really be fixed - all transactions are &quot;online&quot;, allowing them to do push notifications and live fraud checks. For some card machines, particularly when using contactless, this can substantially increase the time it takes for the card machine to process the payment.<p>Most of the issues though seem be caused by their card issuer - rather than interfacing with the card networks directly, they currently go via a company called &quot;GPS&quot; (pretty sure it&#x27;s <a href=""http://www.globalprocessing.ae"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalprocessing.ae</a>). This seems to add notable latency to some transactions, as well as causing a couple of limitations on how you start using the card. I expect all of these problems will be resolved once they issue cards directly.<p>I haven&#x27;t used the card physically outside the UK, but I have done a number of non-GBP transactions online and they all worked fine - with good conversion rates. A number of people on the discourse forum have used it outside the UK and it looks as though they didn&#x27;t have any problems.<p>Support is good - generally very quick responses in-app (they use Intercom), and they&#x27;re very active when it comes to the extended discussion in the discourse forum. A few of the blog posts came about as a result of those discussions.<p>One cool thing is that almost every single screen of the app allows you to give feedback in various ways - flagging merchant details as incorrect, providing suggestions, and letting them know how urgent upcoming features are.<p>Having good APIs is pretty important to me also - although I haven&#x27;t used them yet.

Would you make that statement?<p>This one covers a lot of actual research, but mostly on the relationship between overtime and worker health and safety:\n<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2004-143/pdfs/2004-143.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2004-143/pdfs/2004-143.pdf</a><p>I don’t find much to argue with here.  I don’t dispute the premise that working very long hours can have a health impact in some cases.<p>It was interesting to see the clear step function in the leading graph of average annual work hours by country with the US at ~1850 as the highest of the mostly-western countries, but Thailand, Hong Kong, and South Korea in a distinctly different class, topping out at ~2450 for South Korea.  That made me smile, because one of the Samsung people we work with referred to us at the Oculus Dallas office as “honorary Koreans” because of how hard we work.  I do note that the chart in the Economist link with more recent data has them still at the top, but down to ~2100 hours in 2012.<p>A couple interesting (unrelated) counterpoints from the studies:<p>Sokejima and Kagamimori [1998] observed a U-shaped relationship: as compared with 7 to 9 hours of work per day, higher risk (for cardiovascular problems) was associated with both shorter hours (less than 7 hours a day) and longer hours (more than 11 hours a day)<p>Nakanishi et al. [2001b], however, published the opposite results: white collar workers reporting 10 or more hours of work per day had a lower risk for developing hypertension when compared with workers reporting less than 8 hours of work per day<p>There are some small bits directly discussing performance:<p>3.2d Extended Work Shifts and Performance\nTwo laboratory studies reported deterioration in performance with extended shifts.\nIn contrast, four field studies reported no differences in their performance measures during extended shifts.<p>3.4b Very Long Shifts and Performance\nA study in Ireland by Leonard et al. [1998] reported declines in two tests of alertness and concentration in medical residents who had worked 32-hour on-call shifts. They reported no significant declines in a test of psychomotor performance or a test of memory. A New Zealand survey of anesthesiologists linked long working hours to self-reported clinical errors [Gander et al. 2000].<p>I glanced at the other links, and they look potentially interesting, but non-responsive as far as giving actual data showing that working more than 40 hours a week makes you less productive.<p>Perhaps there is confusion about my position, so let me clarify:<p>Average productivity per hour will decline with extended work.  The highest average hourly productivity could be with shifts as short as six hours for many people; I have no particular thoughts on this, as I have never had reason to care to optimize it.  An assembly line job that is embarrassingly parallel with minimal communication overhead may well be better served to have shorter shifts and more workers.<p>Total net productivity per worker, discounting for any increases in errors and negative side effects, continues increasing well past 40 hours per week.  There are a great many tasks where inefficiency grows significantly with additional workers involved; the Mythical Man Month problem is real.  In cases like these, you are better off with a smaller team of harder working people, even if their productivity-per-hour is somewhat lower.<p>This is critical: it isn’t necessary to maintain performance on an extended shift to still contribute value.  Productivity per hour can deteriorate, even precipitously, and still be non-negative.  Only when you are so broken down that even when you come back the following day your productivity per hour is significantly impaired, do you open up the possibility of actually reducing your net output.<p>There are cases where the consequences of an increased error rate can be a dominant factor -- airline pilots and nuclear plant operators come to mind.  I had to work under FAA mandated crew rest guidelines while operating the Armadillo Aerospace rockets, and I made no complaints.<p>I believe most research that people glance at and see “declines in productivity with longer hours” are talking about declines in productivity-per-hour, and people jump to the incorrect conclusion that you can get just as much done in less time.<p>You called my post “so wrong, and so potentially destructive”, which leads me to believe that you hold an ideological position that the world would be better if people didn’t work as long.  I don’t actually have a particularly strong position there; my point is purely about the effective output of an individual.  If we were fighting an existential threat, say an asteroid that would hit the earth in a year, would you really tell everyone involved in the project that they should go home after 35 hours a week, because they are harming the project if they work longer?",1452537509

I started programming for the web in the late 90s.  At first, it was a jumble of <i></i>P languages (JSP, ASP, PHP) and a database connection, kicking out HTML, with an odd bit of javascript.  It got more organized, with libraries and cookbooks.<p>Then, an interesting thing happened.  In 2004, the java web programming cookbook became obsolete, but everything was a framework.  Struts was the first one.  Then, an explosion.  Struts, Struts 2, Spring MVC, Tiles, Wicket, Tapestry, followed by DI frameworks like Spring MVC, Pico, Google Guice, and lots and lots of ORM frameworks, Hibernate, iBatis, JPA…<p>Programming, for me, became miserable, as in, I didn&#x27;t want to be a programmer anymore, because everything was insanely complicated, and not in a good way.  Not complicated like fascinating data structures and algorithms, more like, complicated in that it is insanely difficult to write a to-do list.  As another college of mine (who passed a notoriously difficult CS curriculum at Berkeley) said, &quot;reading about spring DI makes me want to turn off my computer and go home.&quot;<p>Rails, to me, was truly wonderful.  Even rails was a bit tricky to pick up, since I was used to a very loose way of doing things (Java, Servlets, JDBC, and use a library and/or figure out everything else as it comes up).  But it was worth it, it kept things organized, and most importantly, simple was simple, and enjoyable.<p>I went through a blissful time where things were good for me again, and now?  I haven&#x27;t felt this way since 2005, but it&#x27;s been 10 years, so yeah, I guess we&#x27;re due for another massive disruption.  There is a ticker on the web counting the days since the most recent release of a javascript framework.  Ember, Angular, React… you know, they&#x27;re the product of very intelligent people, but simple isn&#x27;t simple anymore.  Remember &quot;agile development with rails?&quot;, which fictitiously took us through a meeting with a client where we built software right there in the moment?  Long gone.<p>I&#x27;ve said this a few times here on HN - I expect all this to be swept off the coffee table with a great crashing sound.  Just as I had no idea rails was in my future, something else like that is in my future too.  Right now, I wish I&#x27;d had the courage (maybe even the anger) to stick with the older stack and get things done, and refuse to get caught up in something so chaotic.  No, that doesn&#x27;t mean refuse to change, it means refuse to change unless it makes a lot of sense.<p>My tenuous prediction is that isomorphic ruby (and other languages) transpiled to javascript will change web programming so much that the Javascript framework chaos will most likely end with a very different and unanticipated approach.",1452537136

To get enough acceleration to be useful, you usually need an amount of thrust that&#x27;s more like 1.2x your mass.  For example, the fully loaded Saturn V weighed about 6,500,000 lbs and the first stage had 7,650,000 lbs of thrust.<p>So your fully loaded B-52 (~265,000 lbs) needs around 320,000 lbs of thrust from the rockets.  This is more than double the amount of thrust produced by the jet engines.  By the time you&#x27;ve accounted for your rocket engines, strengthened the airframe to survive the rocket thrust, and added a reaction control system (to turn around for deceleration), you&#x27;ve lost a good chunk of your 35 tons of rocket fuel.<p>It&#x27;s about this time you realize that even 35 tons of rocket fuel is a laughably small amount.  A single space shuttle main engine is a bit more powerful than what you&#x27;d need (~420,000 lbs of thrust), but it&#x27;s good enough for ballpark numbers.  It will consume 35 tons of fuel in about a minute... meaning your mission profile is probably something like 30 seconds of vertical acceleration, 15 second horizontal acceleration, 15 seconds horizontal deceleration.  Not enough to take you very high or very far.<p>It&#x27;s not that we <i>can&#x27;t</i> do it, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s woefully inefficient.",1452536809

But if it&#x27;s due to the protocol nature, then maybe it&#x27;s time to look for a successor (we aren&#x27;t using WEP anymore, right?)<p>The attacks on Tor are largely in the form of:<p>A) Outright implementation flaws [e.g. Software bugs ]<p>B) Malicious actors deploying Tor nodes [e.g. On July 4 2014 we found a group of relays that we assume were trying to deanonymize users. They appear to have been targeting people who operate or access Tor hidden services. The attack involved modifying Tor protocol headers to do traffic confirmation attacks.\n <a href=""https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay...</a> ]<p>> A traffic confirmation attack is possible when the attacker controls or observes the relays on both ends of a Tor circuit and then compares traffic timing, volume, or other characteristics to conclude that the two relays are indeed on the same circuit. If the first relay in the circuit (called the &quot;entry guard&quot;) knows the IP address of the user, and the last relay in the circuit knows the resource or destination she is accessing, then together they can deanonymize her. You can read more about traffic confirmation attacks, including pointers to many research papers, at this blog post from 2009:<p>Pretty much the only defense is to control the entry nodes you use yourself by:<p><a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#EntryGuards"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#EntryGuards</a><p>> Restricting your entry nodes may also help against attackers who want to run a few Tor nodes and easily enumerate all of the Tor user IP addresses. (Even though they can&#x27;t learn what destinations the users are talking to, they still might be able to do bad things with just a list of users.) However, that feature won&#x27;t really become useful until we move to a &quot;directory guard&quot; design as well.<p>Its an inherent problem with a low latency anonymity network that is really an open research problem.<p>However, controlling your entry nodes has a different problem:<p>1) It pretty clearly links you to you entering the tor network via a consistent sent of nodes.<p>2) Capturing these nodes via the DC and warrants/legal action has been done in the past. As any is going to be able to find these nodes since they are no longer randomly selected...<p>3) Once you are actively targeted you are just as vulnerable.",1452536484

Why are they doing this? It looks like they&#x27;re reinventing things over and over again. It looks like they are doing some things worse (than I would) on purpose! What puzzling behavior! Perhaps there are some interesting incentives causing them to do this... Perhaps there are good things that result from this behavior... Hmm let me think about it. They must be very strong reasons if so many developers are engaging in this curious behavior.&quot;<p>Now imagine the author in the field:<p>&quot;Just grow hands and pick that thing up you dumb birds!&quot; (JavaScript has an anemic standard library)<p>&quot;Why are you all trying to break an acorn open in different ways? Standardize on something you idiots!&quot; (If there were one true way that instantly convinced everyone, the variety in library design would go down.)<p>JavaScript development has a lot more to do with path dependence than perhaps other more modern languages do. The language itself doesn&#x27;t constrain your strategies in the way, say, Java does. You can create object/class hierarchies, or you can use closures to encapsulate private state.<p>You can use jQuery to manipulate the exact piece of the DOM you&#x27;re interested in, but maybe different oarts of your code clobber each other&#x27;s changes. Or you can use virtual DOM techniques to create the DOM you want in one go, but spend more cpu generating a diff.<p>You can use grunt which is purpose built for assembling js projects, but requires learning a big configuration language. Or you can use gulp which is &quot;just JavaScript&quot; but is more complicated to configure.<p>My point is that the JavaScript ecosystem doesn&#x27;t have all the answers yet, and they&#x27;re looking for them. Closures, prototypical-inheritance, async io... this language is pretty unique and there isn&#x27;t a template to go off of. (What other language has a DOM? What the hell is that?)

They have an incredibly rich mental model, allowing for adaptations that would be risky or impossible to program into an autonomous driver. For example, when lane lines are missing or obscured, human drivers will often follow the car in front of them... unless they observe erratic behavior that might indicate the driver ahead has lost control. What&#x27;s &quot;erratic behavior&quot; is a judgement I wouldn&#x27;t expect near-future software to be particularly good at.<p>Of course, there are areas like reaction time and feedback-based control where autonomous drivers will always be vastly superior to human ones. Which is why it seems to me that the safest option in the medium term is likely to be (as it is today) an increasingly software-assisted human driver. This is the primary reason I&#x27;m down on the chances for wide adoption of fully (or mostly) autonomous drivers in the next 5-10 years: Human + computer will be a safer, more reliable alternative. The active participation of the human will fall off over time, but I think it will be a much flatter curve than many enthusiasts expect.",1452535941

Git tools are increasingly ubiquitous and easy to find. While a good Wiki engine has a concept of document versioning it can vary from Wiki system to Wiki system, whereas the git repository history logs and annotation tools are well standardized and provide multiple choices of options of tools to browse such things (both programmer-centric and some more &quot;friendlier&quot; tools). You can edit the git repository online in Github and the tooling isn&#x27;t all that different in experience from a Wiki to a less technical contributor, whereas a technical contributor can also grab the git repository using a tool of their choice, edit in a friendly environment (IDE/emacs/vim/etc) of their choice.<p>Simplicity to fork can also be important, and beyond just the Github-provide &quot;fork&quot; option, but in general of push/pull communication between &quot;wikis&quot;. Wikis typically are stored in bespoke database schemas and import/export from and between them can be a pain. Git is entirely built around (programmer) collaboration and has protocols for pushing/pulling between repositories. This can make it easy to fork repositories, of course. (Compare to, for example, the Wikipedia world where when sections are &quot;shut down&quot; just about the only well clustered option to preserve them is often Wikia with its somewhat complicated import process of the peculiar MediaWiki XML format and some use of mostly documented public APIs. For smaller Wiki engines than MediaWiki sometimes the only way to migrate data is a raw database dump.)<p>Further more, at the intersection of &quot;ecosystem of tools&quot; and &quot;simplicity to fork&quot;, a wiki like this on Github is &quot;just a folder with a bunch of Markdown files&quot;. Push it to Github and Github builds all your Markdown for you and displays it (and allows you to edit it) in a nice, easy way. Push it to Bitbucket or Visual Studio Team Services or Gitlab or any number of other providers and you get much the same web-based view. You get some choice there between definite competitors. You could add a table of contents and turn it into a Gitbook or Leanpub book (and other less well known competitors in the book from a git-backed folder of Markdown files space). Furthermore, you can always just grab the git repository locally and build the Markdown yourself (again, using any number of command line tool options or IDEs that you prefer to use).",1452535806

You have to remember that it’s only a few hundred years, if that much, that artists are working with money. Artists never got money. Artists had a patron, either the leader of the state or the duke of Weimar or somewhere, or the church, the pope. Or they had another job. I have another job. I make films. No one tells me what to do. But I make the money in the wine industry. You work another job and get up at five in the morning and write your script.</i><p><i>This idea of Metallica or some rock n’ roll singer being rich, that’s not necessarily going to happen anymore. Because, as we enter into a new age, maybe art will be free. Maybe the students are right. They should be able to download music and movies. I’m going to be shot for saying this. But who said art has to cost money? And therefore, who says artists have to make money?</i><p><i>In the old days, 200 years ago, if you were a composer, the only way you could make money was to travel with the orchestra and be the conductor, because then you’d be paid as a musician. There was no recording. There were no record royalties. So I would say, “Try to disconnect the idea of cinema with the idea of making a living and money.” Because there are ways around it.</i><p><i>You have to remember that it’s only a few hundred years, if that much, that artists are working with money.</i>",1452535801

Since every hg client has to be able to inter-operate with any hg client from any other machine, regardless of whether it&#x27;s been updated or not, it makes sense to retain old functionality, so that newer clients can still talk to older ones. I believe rsync also does a similar thing, where it has some kind of system to figure out the highest version of the rsync protocol supported by both sides, and newer rsync versions support all the old versions of the protocol. Emacs is not in this position. Multiple versions of Emacs can always inter-operate as long as they can all read and write text files.",1452535268

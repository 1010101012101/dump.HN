See here: <a href=""http://www.lawmart.com/searches/difference.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lawmart.com/searches/difference.htm</a><p>tl;dr: Trademarks are more to do with logos and branding, their intent being to allow a company to distinguish themselves in a market with a certain identity. Violations of Trademarks are usually linked to consumers being mislead into believing a product is from one company when it is in fact from another.<p>T-Mobile does not own a copyright for Magenta. They don't own Magenta. If I want to make Magenta chairs they have no say. They would never receive a Trademark on black, however.<p>If you start making magenta phones, it's reasonable to assume that the average consumer would confuse them with the already popular magenta phones being promoted by T-Mobile, and this might damage their brand, given that your phones might not work to the same standard.<p>It's generally not good to form an opinion of topics before you actually obtain a relevant amount of education. It can lead you to making yourself look really stupid.",1313600399

Part of the fundamental reason managing python packages is such a pain (or perl packages, or ruby packages, etc) is that they're installed once for the whole system.<p>Virtualenv allows you to sandbox all your packages in a directory local to your development/deployment environment.  You no longer need to install anything on the base system, and you can have multiple virtualenvs side-by-side.  In addition, you can copy a virtualenv from your build environment to your production environment by just copying the directory.<p>This gives you huge wins in versioning packages, testing out different versions alongside each other, and being able to strongly validate that what you tested in your staging environment is the same thing that got deployed to your production systems.<p>In general, I'm a very strong believer of pushing _everything_ your production environment relies on to a single directory on your production system, rather than installing it on the base system.

So, one has to ask, what is Groupon's retention strategy for all this wallet-share they are grabbing?<p>Vendors and customers who are of the mindset to avail themselves of a Groupon-like service are driven by the value of the deals. There is no inherent loyalty to the voucher provider, or automatic lock-in of mindshare. If vendors and consumers can get a better deal from someone else, they will.<p>So, while Groupon, LivingSocial and the rest may currently enjoy decent margins, what prevents them from being locked into a race-to-the-bottom of razor thin margins as the markets saturate? To my mind, having the largest list of emails to spam with targeted offers is not a sufficient defense against this. It just slows the attrition.<p>So, then the question is, if there is nothing that prevents a race-to-the-bottom, aren't the companies that maintain the highest operational efficiencies (and profitability) - not the ones that grab fastest the most of the ultimately indefensible lands - going to be the ones that prevail, in the end?<p>And, let's not forget, this land grab strategy is/will be failure unless Groupon can actually raise the capital required to actually <i>stay</i> in operations and see through to fruition.",1313599545

In particular, the government was forcing lenders to accept more risk (viz sub-prime borrowers) than they would otherwise have done. Also, the lenders themselves incorrectly modeled their risk exposures.<p>None of your objections:<p><i>what about information asymmetry? What about borked incentives? What about just plain stupid? ""I played golf with the guy so I'll buy it""? ""I know these instruments are crap but I'll sell them to my clients to get them off my balance sheet""?</i><p>hold any water:<p>Information asymmetry (also, incorrect information as with lenders in '08): This has nothing to do with the efficiency of markets. The efficient market hypothesis depends on actors behaving rationally to achieve their goals. That does not mean that those actors will always be correct. For example, in <i>The Myth of the Rational Voter</i>[1], Caplan describes how it's actually rational behavior for voters to vote <i>irrationally</i>: the benefit of the degree they can sway the election is far smaller than the cost of acquiring sufficient knowledge to determine what candidate would most benefit them.<p>Bad incentives: it's the incentives (see ""Invisible Hand"") that make things work properly! To the extent that the incentives are wrong, these are the regulations, the aberrations that make things deviate from the free market. In your '08 complaint, that was the Congress forcing lenders to take on borrowers that would not normally have qualified. It also comes from externalities, places where our laws prevent the free market from completely accounting for the costs of an action. For example, because air and waterways are held in common by the government, without a real owner, there is nothing capturing the cost of pollution. Thus, incomplete property rights leads to market failures. If the government got out of the way, the market <i>could</i> resolve it (see ""Coase Theorem"")<p>Stupidity: as separate from your other points, well, there's no such thing -- at least not that we can perceive. Mises shows that (a) each person acts to maximize his own utility, and (b) it's impossible for outside observers (and frequently even the individual himself) to know what ends he is attempting to achieve. Thus, if your hypothetical golfer places some personal value on the relationship with his golf buddy, it may be perfectly rational for him to spend extra few bucks buying from the guy. And you and I certainly aren't privy to enough information to decide that it's not so.<p>Fraud: your Yankees example seems to be an example of fraud, and thus can't be considered a free market transaction. Fooling someone into a transaction is no different from forcing them into a transaction.<p>That said, research in psychology and econometrics has shown that people do systematically misconstrue very large or very small values, leading us to sometimes choose differently from what we really intend. The only solution to this, of course, is to formally model the problem to enable us to act rationally. In this day and age, such models are de rigeur, but -- as I note above -- the investment in the models itself has some risk: we're balancing correctness against cost to develop and feed the model. As with the rational voter, this can lead us to ""rationally irrational"" behavior, but this is just a meta-behavior of the free market, not an indictment of it.<p>Moreover, there is no way around any of the issues that you cite. All of these things can be applied equally -- if not more -- to government regulators (see ""public choice economics"", ""regulatory capture"", etc.). Why would you want to give power to entities who won't be able to use it any more wisely than the people themselves?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Action"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Action</a>",1313598767

2895862,comment,2895444,2895601,9,0,mdasen,,,"The question is whether this is a fad or not.  Companies always try new marketing tricks.  The type of marketing that stays is the marketing that benefits the company.<p>This type of group buying is relatively new and lots of companies (small and large) are testing it out.  They're willing to chance making a bad decision to see whether it works or not.  The question isn't whether Groupon is getting a decent cut, but whether companies are going to see this as a long term part of their business in the same way that other marketing techniques are.  Businesses might find that they try it out, lose money, don't get repeat business, and it becomes another thing that no one uses in a couple years.<p>Groupon's business is that it has a mailing list (basically) of people looking for deals.  That's the service they're offering businesses.  At what point do deals of 50% off or more need such publicity?  So, even if they become the 500lb gorilla and group-deal marketing isn't a fad, how likely is it going to matter?  I'm not saying that it doesn't matter, but truly great deals tend to be spread (I'm remembering an Old Navy one that half my friends posted on Facebook).<p>Beyond that, there's a danger in marketing to people specifically looking for deals - and specifically people looking for deals that don't require much hunting.  Companies spend a lot on price discrimination (getting people who will pay more for a product to do so).  Companies use coupons that people willing to pay more will ignore or forget about, they sell different editions of products to get the back of your head saying, ""I can't tell a difference, but am I going to be disappointed if I buy the cheaper one?"", etc.  If Groupon becomes <i>so</i> popular, there is also the risk that the deals will become easy to the point that you aren't getting extra marginal business to people who might not buy your product, but rather lowering your average price since so many people are on it.  In fact, using a less-known deal site might be beneficial since it could grab the people who really wouldn't pay full price while flying under the radar of those who are just casual deal people.<p>The worst thing might be if the government decides that Groupon is selling gift certificates.  Gift certificates are regulated including things like expiry dates.  Right now, there's the possibility for me to spend $20 for $40 of goods and forget to redeem it within the (usually) short redemption period.  That might change as Groupon gets bigger or one Groupon user decides to sue over the expired ""gift certificate"" and a judge sides with them.  In fact, at least in Massachusetts, Groupon the gift certificate law would seem to apply since it includes merchandise credits and ""and any other medium that evidences the giving of consideration in exchange for the right to redeem it for goods, food, services, credit or money.""  I haven't looked over Groupon's filings, but that seems like it would impact on their business - either by taking more money from them or the business depending on who keeps the revenue from non-redeemed cards.  And even if it's the business, that means a change in how willing businesses are to sign up.  I'm sure businesses are keeping track of how many sold to how many redeemed.<p>I'm not saying that Groupon is terrible or won't become valuable.  However, there are pitfalls.  ""Group buying"" might be a fad.  Businesses might not find it in their interest to give Groupon half of the revenue or might find these lazy deal-hunters not in their interest.  Larger size could become a hindrance as the larger they get, the more it will affect average sales price rather than just marginal sales price.

Let's do letters, colors, etc. And of course as soon as you trademark a color, it implies that you've trademarked all the individual colors that make it up. Thus a trademark on the color white (#FFFFFF (c) (tm) Igor Partola, all rights reserved) would give you all other colors.<p>[1] <a href=""http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/color-the-next-limited-resource/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/color-the-next-limited-re...</a><p>EDIT: Fixed silly color theory mistake.<p>EDIT2: s/copyright/trademark/g",1313597055

If both employer and employee <i></i>agree<i></i> to that, it's fine.<p>The point is, if you hire someone full-time for $X, you probably expect something like 40 hours a week out of them. If they just stop showing up 4 days of the week without talking to you, it's the same as if they somehow managed to withdraw 5 times their salary from your bank account without talking to you.",1313597023

If you want to make claims like that then actually make them, don't just wave your hands.<p>You're arguing over the degree of something which is just silly. Either both count or neither counts. Who cares if 10% of Chrome's code is proprietary and 15% of Safari's code is proprietary, or vice versa? If one counts as an open source browser then so does the other.<p>The important pieces that actually deal with content are all open so I would count them both, but that's just me. If you want to draw lines and make it sound scientific then you better show us some numbers. You don't get to draw imaginary lines because you just think that's where a line should be, if Chrome is more open tell us how.",1313596927

2895777,comment,2895444,2895444,7,0,spanktheuser,,,"I'm not terribly impressed with this article. It rehashes the thinking of HN and other bloggers without adding anything new - other than the HBR logo at the top. I guess that's important for  people who let HBR tell them what to believe. And the following point just seems completely wrong to me:<p>>> And unlike the very few successful companies that scaled before they were profitable (think Facebook or Amazon), Groupon's business model does not benefit from significant network effects.<p>Can someone explain how Amazon's consumers benefit from network effects? Amazon is a great business, but it's not more valuable to me because other HNers shop there. And then there's Google. Another company that experienced tremendous growth and unprofitability before finally turning on a fountain of cash. They would also seem to be a case where there's no obvious network effect fueling their growth.<p>There's good reason to be dubious about Groupon, but I'm pretty disappointed by the quality of the debate in many cases. Groupon's business model is really simple. They'll be OK if the life-time value of their subscriber base exceeds the money spent on customer acquisition (ok, and some operating costs). There are plenty of useful metrics we can use to forecast their likelihood of success. Data like offer quality, merchant churn, subscriber acquisition costs, revenue per customer, unsubscribe rates will determine their fate. Everything else is just a sideshow.",1313596880

I am thinking about making it ad supported but while we have a lot of solutions for mobile, I could not found any solution for the Desktop. I am thinking about using AdMob and loading its web code in a little webview in the program. This would work on both mobile and desktop but I don't know if it is allowed. Anyone knows better?<p>Any developer using some Ad solution for the Desktop? Anyone knows if loading the web code in a web view inside a program is allowed? (I don't see any info about this in their terms)<p>I know this is not a coding question but a developer strategy question.

Although I can see the attraction.  It's nice to simplify things to a level where a human being can actually have the answers with a high degree of confidence.<p>Both the tea-party-hayekians and the linked paper fall into this trap..  what about information asymmetry?  What about borked incentives?  What about just plain stupid?  ""I played golf with the guy so I'll buy it""?  ""I know these instruments are crap but I'll sell them to my clients to get them off my balance sheet""?<p>A friend was telling me at his old job, they actually worked in season tickets to a luxury booth at Yankee stadium into a very significant tech purchase.

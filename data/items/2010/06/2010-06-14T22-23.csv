1431300,comment,1430785,1431283,0,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""They should be announcing cool awesome features no other device has got.""</i><p>God no. Apple has rarely ever introduced any features that is simply unheard of on other devices. That is not Apple's core strength: their strength is doing the same things everyone is already doing, but doing it better, making it more accessible and usable, and giving it sleekness and sexiness that it simply did not have before.<p>Apple is never at the very forefront of raw functionality, it's at the forefront of accessibility and usability.<p>Even now, it's fairly well acknowledged that Apple's copy/paste is the slickest/easiest implementation out there on a mobile device. They were late to the game (and admitted themselves as such) but they did it better than the incumbents.<p>I'm not sure where this Apple hate comes from, with the ""hur hur hur Apple plays other people's inventions off like their own!"" - this has rarely ever been the case.",1276556170

(Hey! Startup idea). The first entry in each column becomes the data field. The program is smart enough to take a sample data from each column, and use that to auto-pick the best data type. (Also re-checks a random sample periodically and re-defines data type if necessary). Bonus points for creating excel templates for consistency ('actions template', 'to-do list template', 'known bugs'....etc. Last one was a joke) and for easier definition of relationships between different spreadsheets (like for like data comparisons and relationships as long as the user enters the right info in the right cell). Now that Office has migrated to the web, this could be entirely web-based.<p>People's workflow visually to them remains exactly the same, which would overcome the biggest obstacle - unfamiliarity and resistance to change. Non-techies who need to make a list of customers, processes or actions don't know or think about headaches they are creating for themselves or others down the line. It's only the technically literate who would appreciate the problems of consistent, clean data, version control etc. This solution would begin to answer some of those problems.",1276556031

1431291,comment,1430156,1430156,0,0,edash,,,"I've tried lots of different phone systems and still haven't found a good solution yet, but hopefully my experience is instructive:<p>RING CENTRAL: RingCentral provided a toll-free number for me. Their interface is awful and they're just generally not that innovative, but they accomplished the task for $15 / mo or so. I wouldn't use them again, but only because there was no ""wow.""<p>GOOGLE VOICE: Google Voice is hit or miss. The connection is spotty, the dial out sometimes just doesn't work, there's a slight delay in the connection when answering etc. It is promising as a personal product, but nowhere near business quality. I've tried on two occasions...and both times got frustrated and needed to switch. Contrary to what others have said, you can have a phone assigned to two Google Voice accounts, but one must be marked ""home/office"" and it won't be able to send or receive SMS messages. It's confusing because I'm sure they're trying to avoid this use case.<p>GRASSHOPPER: I have been using Grasshopper for 3 months after hearing recommendations from Jason Fried and Mixergy. I find their interface to be really unintuitive and difficult to use.<p>They have great support, but I had to rely on it too often. I called 5-6 times to set up basic Google Voice functionality (route calls to my cell phone, have voice mail). The Java program for recording your voicemail greeting was wonky and broke often. The recording was poor as well. They encourage you to hire voice actors to do the work, but I want my voicemail to sound like a human, not a radio robot. They should simply allow you to upload an MP3.<p>There's no good way to dial out. With Google Voice you can log-in to the web app or use their mobile app. With Grasshopper, the only way to dial out is to call a number first, then dial the number you want to call. With this approach, sometimes connections were refused that were later successful from my cell phone. Nice people and I love what they're doing with Chargify, but I plan to move to something else...<p>TWILIO: I considered Twilio and will most likely use it for other aspects of the business (click to call, sms follow-up). But I ultimately decided it was better to use a solution designed for this purpose rather than spend developer resources making Twilio work for us. It will be cool to see applications built upon Twilio that solve problems like this.<p>LINE2: Line2 looked interesting, but recently had crippling DDOS problems and is iPhone only. It also seems best suited for a single person consultancy rather than a company.<p>ONSIP: I recently decided to make the move to OnSip. They were also recommended by Jason Fried. Since they are essentially just providing virtual PBX via SIP, you can choose from a wide selection of phones, apps from third party developers etc. So I plan to purchase an office phone (with a cord!) and use that during work hours. When I'm not in the office, or for off-hours, calls will be routed to my cell phone and I'll use an iPhone app to dial out.",1276555889

This comes to 114 dpi at the 30 inches away that I just measured my screen at. And yet when I pick a small-but-generally-readable font, I can see that for example the leftmost leg of an 'm' looks different than the other two.<p>So I would say you want sufficiently high resolution that pixelization artifacts aren't visible, which means that adding or subtracting one pixel from a one-arc-minute item leaves it still at one-arc-minute. Maybe 2px/arc-minute would do this well enough, maybe it would take 3. But 1px/arc-minute still permits visible artifacts.",1276555887

I also don't think that this graphic novel is offensive - it looks interesting, well written and well drawn. It is certainly art, not porn.<p>However I can't see how Apple can curate for quality without also curating for taste. To run a store like this no doubt means employing hundreds of young testers and a bunch of draconian policies.

To do it in a way that will not enrage prudes, governments, religious types, anyone who wants to bash Apple for any other reason etc is something else entirely.<p>To set up a good 18+ store in this way will be nigh-on impossible without either dropping all rules (and therefore all quality) or risking the wrath of the moral majority.<p>Having the occasional piece of genuine art rejected to walk this fine line is no doubt seen as a reasonable compromise.<p>I hope that Apple can fix this - but I'm not sure they will be able.",1276555136

When she says 'man' it is shorthand for an adult human capable of rational thought. If the human in question is not capable of rational thought (infant, retarded person), then most of Rand's theory does not apply.  It consists of <i>qualified</i> universal claims, all depending on the nature of the organism (on a case by case basis, but we generalize for convenience).<p>Meeting an overwhelming foe in war is an ethical emergency where there is no good outcome, just a choice of bad ones. As such, do whatever seems to best protect that which you value most, either fleeing or fighting (or even dieing to save others) could be moral decisions. These are not the problematic parts of Rand's philosophy, the rules themselves don't change - but they are in fact the problematic parts of almost every other philosophy I come across: ie. the unhelpful focus on emergencies and exceptions, rendering the 'answers' irrelevant to everyday life. See Rand's essay 'The Ethics of Emergencies' for more on this.<p>You say the concept of the individual is wrong but just as morality only has meaning to the living, <i>this very discussion</i> only has meaning if it involves conscious, self-aware individuals, so there's literally no point entertaining any idea to the contrary (even though I'd like to point out that molecules still exist as unique entities even though they're made up of quarks).<p>Also it's irrelevant whether there is a hardwired survival instinct in place or not - as I said the whole thing rests on a conditional premise, a choice.

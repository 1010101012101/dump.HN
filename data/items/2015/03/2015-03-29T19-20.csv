I pay for 120 mbps but when connected via cat 5 it only reached 90 max mbps which would fine considering when using a wifi router it only reaches around 30 mbps. I have moved around the wifi router but it doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference. The technician told me the 120 mbps that I am being charged for is for for direct access and wifi won&#x27;t reach 120mbps. I complained to customer care saying if I go to the grocery store and pay for 120 items, I expect to get 120 items, not 30 items. I told them they should tell people upfront that 120 mbps is when you are plugged in directly since most people use a wifi router but this still doesn&#x27;t make sense to me since they can easily downgrade you to, say, 6 mbps without a problem.<p>Does anyone know if this OpenWRT works?

For people you don&#x27;t know personally, the right attitude is benevolence (unless and until a particular person gives you a good reason to avoid them.)<p>Maybe some people say that I could live by that standard with the GPL, but my own judgement is that I (as well as the people and things that I care about) am far better off without being encumbered by it in the slightest.",1427656092

9286017,comment,9285245,9285808,0,0,cheatsheet,,,">  Computer generated art tends to lack this trait, and this, I think, is why it feels less valid than human-made art.<p>I could not disagree with you more.<p>Most of traditional contemporary art for the past 100 years have been art pieces and products that are meta-critiques and meta-dialogues of the current understanding of Art, conversations between artists... These things attempt to explore what Art truly is. Some aspects of post modernism have taken it to the point where everything is absolutely meaningless, others as a caricature or commentary on post capitalist society.<p>Yves Klein painted things blue and this is art. Rothko painted squares, except more notable (to me, at least) were the namings of his paintings, most called &quot;no. #&quot; and such. Dali put drawers and pom poms on the breasts of classical Grecian figures, and let us not forget about Dada - whose chief goal was to destroy Art, only to become included under the category of artistic movements.<p>Aesthetics has been discussed for centuries, and at core, is a philosophical question. It shares many characteristics similar to computer code and classical logic, once you&#x27;ve abstracted layer on top of meta layer, until you really are scratching your head, wondering what the symbols you&#x27;ve generated actually mean.<p>As a painter for 20 years, and as software developer / computer scientist for 15, I rarely see anything besides an image of a thing when I walk into a museum. In computer code and mathematics, I see much, much more, and whatever it is that code communicates to me is infinite and entangled completely in my being and my nature.",1427655962

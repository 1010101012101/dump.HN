Ruby <i>looks</i> a lot like you could come to it from Java and know most of it, but metaprogramming actually takes a long time and a lot of work to really figure out.<p>Similarly, Ruby has many different little variants -- Rails, Rake, various sorts of DSLs -- and that adds significantly to the time to learn it.<p>Really learning Ruby is learning several similar languages, which makes two years a much harder number to achieve.<p>C++ could easily have been like that if it had different constellations of features that were routinely used in different ways by the same programmers.  Imagine if there were a whole ""C++ tools"" subculture that used templates extensively but differently, along with one or two other nontrivial features (say, multiple inheritance and exceptions) used in specific ways with specific non-compiler-mandated rules.<p>You'd have to learn, in effect, about another programming language's worth of material to program fluently within that subculture.<p>Ruby has several of those.",1320457734

Productivity increases due to workers shifting their workloads to the optimal times of day.<p>Perhaps some workers perform better over the span of a day if they take a 4 hour break in the middle for a main meal, quick sleep and some social activity? Perhaps others perform better if conducting their work in one contiguous block?<p>Some people like ordered, repeatable and structured schedules.

Let's draw a classic management-consulting two-by-two matrix:<p><pre><code>  GENIUS-JUDGEMENT       GENIUS+JUDGEMENT

  AVG-JUDGEMENT          AVG + JUDGEMENT
</code></pre>
The author's argument is that the column on the right trumps the column on the left: Judgement is important, even if the genius-with-poor-judgement is some kind of CS demigod. However, he doesn't actually say that lack-of-genius and lack-of-judgement are correlated, or that he'd turn down a wise genius if such a rare and precious being fell on him from the sky. You've gotten the unfortunate impression that he's saying that, but that's an artifact of trying to use two examples to describe a fuzzy multidimensional space. (I mean, really, even two dimensions is a painfully naive approximation, except of course to a management consultant. ;)<p>Of course, if the original blog post used my four examples it would be as dull as... management consulting. The moral of this story is that writing is hard. You have to leave some ambiguity, and trust the reader to fill in the gaps, and hope the gaps are not too large, and that your sly invocation of the trendy-yet-pragmatic NoSQL user in the penultimate paragraph helps people take the hint.

3198458,comment,3198087,3198406,3,0,wallflower,,,"A very smart developer who I respect once said something like: when you are young, you have lots of energy and want to learn/use the latest technology. As you get older and gain more experience, you start to see the patterns. It's not about the technology, there are repeated themes and solutions. But when you start realizing this and have accumulated 7 years of experience, you may be transitioning out and wanting to begin starting a family. So the people who might be most qualified might be wanting to leave the intensity of coding for the relative stability of management.<p>So perhaps n years of experience is a cludgy filter for the relative graybeards who understand that technology is just a tool, not an end in itself.",1320455243

It also helps that she asks exactly the right questions and receives the right answers.<p>How many devices do we expect to have?
Well, we hope to sell 500 in 12 months.
How often will they need to report in?
Roughly once an hour.
How reliable is the network?
Itll use WiFi, so fairly reliable.<p>In reality, sometimes you ask these questions, you get very accurate answers and based on that, you pick some technology that you believe will spot on address the problem. You might even make the judgment call that you have enough wiggle room to include one or two new concepts you've been curious about, that are yet still very relevant to the task at hand.<p>Then something happens mid-project and it turns out that what was originally <i>requested</i> wasn't actually what was <i>needed</i>. How many times has that happened?<p>Two possible conclusions in these situations, for either developers:<p>- the ""rockstar"" either looks like a god, for having foreseen some problems, or he'll be the guy who brought a tank to a knife fight.<p>- whereas the ""great developer"" will just look incompetent, or she'll just be, well, great.<p>Judgment is a nice trait for a good developer, but it is subjective. There are some hits and some misses.<p>What I believe makes a _great_ developer is the fact that they might work to push their own boundaries, which is the reason you're interested in them in the first place, but most importantly, when they do, they stand by their work.<p>I can't embrace a definition of a great developer, where the primary quality is to avoid causing trouble for the company, the project, the team or their boss. That has almost nothing to do with the discipline. You're describing a ""great employee"" or a ""great team player"".<p>The exact description of a great developer given in this article might absolutely not work in other environments, where developers are required to push the envelope and think outside the box. In such context, your great developer might be thought of as mediocre at best.",1320454804

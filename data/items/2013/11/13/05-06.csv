But, you know, if you&#x27;re kind of in a &quot;I want the convenience of eating my food from a pre-mixed sack&quot; mode, it&#x27;s not illogical that you may be less social with your mealtimes. &quot;Hey, bring your sack over to my place and we&#x27;ll gulp them down in 5 minutes together!&quot;<p>><i>It&#x27;s kind of like aging: because it kinda just happens, we have accepted it as a normal thing.

6723630,comment,6719487,6723469,1,0,yetanotherphd,,,"We usually call the immediate effect (in this case on interest rates) partial equilibrium, and the &quot;full&quot; effect including all flow on effects, &quot;general equilibrium&quot;.  And there are models which include dynamic and random effects (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium - DSGE - models).  Can&#x27;t tell you much about them apart from the name :-)<p>Anyway it seems like messing with debt contracts is a bad way to change the interest rate, if that&#x27;s all you want to do, since that is precisely the lever that the Federal Reserve controls anyway.",1384322361
6723629,comment,6723219,6723524,6,0,HarrisonFisk,,,"Doing compression on the ZFS level is significantly worse than InnoDB compression.<p>InnoDB has a lot of really smart optimizations which make it much better than just zipping things up.  Included are the modification log (so you only have to re-compress occasionally) and a dynamic scaling ability to keep compressed pages in memory rather than always decompressing.  These optimizations are really only possible with an understanding of the data.<p>I would only consider ZFS for something like an append-only data warehouse type system.",1384322342

Without being so dependent on a job, more bargaining power would be on the side of the employee, so I presume there&#x27;d be a huge rise in part-time employment, and workers&#x27; liberties.  So most of the restrictions you&#x27;re associating with employment would potentially be much less repressive than they are today.",1384322306

You should have focused on what it can do now and the vision of what it could become and then spent the second half on the open source aspects of it.<p>You could have also added a steady cam scene following someone around their home and watching their environment change with them. e.g.<p>Someone is sitting on the bed reading a book and the nightstand light is on. They get up and move to the door and lighting comes on in the hallway as they walk towards the kitcken lights turn on behind them until they get to the kitchen and get a snack. Then reserve the process until they get back to the bedroom.<p>This kind of stuff looks like the perfect application for Prolog.

The reason external dependencies are a problem for me is that they take away my ability to control my system.  If I have to hack together something to use it without the servers, then that&#x27;s a marginal improvement over having to reverse engineer the protocol on the wire, but it&#x27;s still <i>really</i> customer unfriendly.<p>Anyone who buys this system and makes it central to their home&#x27;s operation (as intended) becomes exceptionally vulnerable to the decisions of the people who control the servers.  Even if the developers&#x27; interests always align with my interests, I&#x27;m still vulnerable if their system gets hacked, if they go bankrupt (and shut down) or if they are acquired by a company with a different management perspective.<p>It would be like buying a car that has to check in with Lexus every time I want to start the engine.",1384322205

Someone writing native C code wants threads and low level currency primitives. Javascript is fundamentally unable to model that, and Javascript as designed for the browser does not model synchronous blocking either (XHR sync and dispatchEvent notwithstanding)<p>I feel like both PNaCL and asm.js are a kludge in search of a problem. I just don&#x27;t see either of these winning over say, DICE to implement Battlefield 4 in a browser, or Valve for the next Half-Life franchise. Triple-A developers don&#x27;t want to leave performance on the table, and running your code inside of a browser virtual machine, even a C-based sandboxed one virtually guarantees that.<p>Asm.js might be vitally important for a platform like Firefox OS, but I doubt either PNaCl or Asm.js will ever be something the drive by web bothers with, because the kinds of applications that need native levels of performance are also the ones native developers are most likely to do native platform specific ports for.  That is, having to recompile and port from Win32 to OSX to Linux is worthy tradeoff vs losing 20-50% performance off the bat, not to mention the different purchasing behaviors of Web users vs console or native mobile users.",1384321877

It goes against common sense, Gates says. Most parents dont choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die.<p>If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,says Melinda.<p>In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn.

I agree that all else being equal, there&#x27;s every reason to believe that this sort of change would produce a new static equilibrium, at least in terms of debt itself. (My doubt is more about the net effect on the economy as a whole, as debt seems to be a matter of some debate even today. The dominant economic thought seems to be pretty comfortable with it, I have to admit I&#x27;m coming around to more of a &quot;Black Swan&quot; sort view where I think the dominant consensus is overvaluing it, which interestingly also accords with a lot of historical thinking on the topic albeit not with that amount of mathematical backing.)",1384319265

6570145,comment,6569792,6569792,4,0,grn,,,"I live in Poland, went to school here, and definitely cannot confirm the claims made in the article. Half of my education happened in the reform school system that the article mentions and almost everyone agrees that it&#x27;s much worse that the previous one.<p>High school in Poland used to be a preparation for further education at university. It ends with a nation-wide exam called matura. The reform greatly reduced the number of other types of schools. It has two effects. First, it&#x27;s much harder to find a skilled worker because there are much less workers trained. Second, the general level of education at high schools dropped significantly. It had to drop because otherwise many of the new pupils wouldn&#x27;t pass the matura. Notions of a logarithm, exponential, prime decomposition has become foreign to pupils. No one has heard about a derivative or an integral for more than a decade.<p>Of course all the above is a generalisation. There are some great schools with teachers who really want to teach their subjects instead of just formally completing stages of the government-mandated education program. Unfortunately they are in minority. I&#x27;m really concerned about quality of education that my children will get in this country. Home schooling is an option though an expensive one.",1382079365

Rather, it increases the amount of RAM you can use before the system moves from the &quot;acceptable performance&quot; regime (minimal swapping) to the &quot;dismal performance&quot; regime (lots of swapping).  For things like running Rails apps on a relatively small VPS, or getting the most out of a limited-RAM machine like an Eee PC or Raspberry Pi, this is very important.",1382079350

6570139,comment,6569690,6569855,4,0,seventytwo,,,"Thanks for the feedback! We&#x27;re just starting out and this is an excellent stress test for us... Any other concerns or comments are greatly appreciated.<p>Alliteration and portmanteau are a given for something like this. However, we designed the site to be able to handle submissions like foreign words, obscure English words, and also completely made-up words. Additionally, the scenarios don&#x27;t necessarily need to be word-less lexical gaps! They can describe something which may already have a bunch of words associated with it - the WFT platform being used, in that case, as a voting (or popularity contest) system for the existing slang. Last, to counter the practicality of UD, WFT has the ability to search based on the scenarios and keywords. Once our databases are bit more filled out, users will be able to come to the site to search for a situation and see the most commonly-used (or most clever or whatever) words for that.<p>I do agree, however, that it may take some effort and some tweaking of the site to encourage something more than the lowest-common-denominator submissions from the general public. Then again, there&#x27;s a trade-off there between improving content and alienating potential users.<p>Thanks for the feedback though! Lots to think about!",1382079320

Per the article&#x27;s title, it is refuting Apple&#x27;s claim that it &quot;cannot&quot; access iMessages, and on that basis, I think it&#x27;s entirely valid. Apple put out a statement earlier this year:<p><i>For example, conversations which take place over iMessage and FaceTime are protected by end-to-end encryption so no one but the sender and receiver can see or read them. Apple cannot decrypt that data. [1]</i><p>I didn&#x27;t read the article as asserting that the encryption is broken or poorly designed, simply that if compelled, Apple could indeed eavesdrop on iMessages, which contradicts the above statement. The author explains this explicitly:<p><i>In fairness to Apple, most other commercial messaging systems are also vulnerable to man-in-the-middle or similar attacks mounted by insiders. The difference is that few if any of those other providers have issued public statements claiming the messages sent over their services can be read only by the sender and receiver.</i><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.apple.com/apples-commitment-to-customer-privacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.apple.com/apples-commitment-to-customer-privacy/</a>",1382078993

None of them is finished, or in a &quot;correct&quot; state. I would start something, to stop it half way through in order to start something else. I would sit on the computer to work, and start gaming a few minutes later. . .
But lately, within 3 weeks, I popped up my first android application on the store; without any prior knowledge on database, webscrapping or anything else I needed to build the app.
The difference? The users. A friend of mine called me saying : Hey, I do that every morning, and the current way of doing it is a pain. I am sure you can do something for me.
And magically enough, I got motivated, working my arse off to get the first version finished. Since it is on the market, I got 60 recurring users and growing. And this keeps me motivated. I put hours on the project, just because I get feedback.
So the conclusion: Do something that someone asked you to. Get your users first, start working afterwards. Don&#x27;t be alone.
If you don&#x27;t have users, then join a project that has already started, in order to code with someone and get some interaction.
I think that for a good 90% of us, what keeps up working is the passion for solving problems others have.
Hope this helps :)<p>The updated version is that I am currently having 700 daily users, everyone is really happy on the store (4.47/5) and I keep working on it daily.<p>Hope this helps :)",1382076686

Smaller spreads, more counterparties, faster execution -- these things cannot possibly hurt.<p>Note that I am talking about the concept of HFT.  It&#x27;s true that there are shady operators who abuse rules and undertake things like quote stuffing.  I&#x27;m not here to defend any of that.<p>> So you got your order filled in 5 milliseconds instead of 6 milliseconds. So what? You&#x27;re a person.<p>Still a net benefit even for just market orders.  Limit orders benefit much more from HFT, particularly the stop-hunting variety.  I think of the randomized price action as similar to quantum noise.  No one really knows to the nth decimal what the price should be, but it wanders around where the money thinks it should be.<p>So that noise can help trigger your limit trade at exactly the price you want, whereas the false placidity of more granular enforcement is less likely to hit your limit.<p>Now let&#x27;s look beyond just me and consider that some firms get more relative benefit from HFT than I do, and that these slivers of benefit sum across market participants.<p>> And stocks without enough liquidity to get to a penny spread? The HFTs don&#x27;t like those stocks, because the &quot;F&quot; is not &quot;H&quot; enough for them to participate. The very nature of HFTs is that they prefer to participate when there is already plenty of liquidity.<p>Of course -- this should not be surprising in the least to anyone paying attention.  The reason HFT practitioners participate is to attempt a profitable strategy.  Liquidity is the side effect, not the goal.  So while it&#x27;s fair to say they provide liquidity to the market, or even that providing liquidity is the role they play, it&#x27;s neither their duty nor their motivation.<p>Similar to how commodities speculators provide counterparties for nervous farmers, they are guided by the invisible hand and not by duty.",1382076497

The service fee is the same between iDevices, leaving the up-front cost as the only apparent price discriminator.<p>It may be &quot;stupid&quot; for a customer to pick the slightly-cheaper 5C when considering total costs, but there is a market that places greater value on the extra $100 due at sign-up than on the superiority of the 5S over the 5C, and that is a market in which you and I do not take part.",1382076182

They woo this crowd with a stripped-down array of high quality stock-keeping units, and high-quality customer service. The high wages produce the high levels of customer service, and the small number of products are what allow them to pay the high wages. Fewer products to handle (and restock) lowers the labor intensity of your operation. In the case of Trader Joes, it also dramatically decreases the amount of space you need for your supermarket ... which in turn is why their revenue per square foot is so high. (Costco solves this problem by leaving the stuff on pallets, so that you can be your own stockboy).<p>And Walmart is the exact opposite of those things: It thrives on selling poor people everything they need and can afford, and they need lots of cheap labor to do everything a Walmart store needs to do on a daily basis.",1382076082

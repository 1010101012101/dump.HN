85058,comment,84988,84988,0,0,kmt,,,"BS.  I reply to all most of the time, because usually there was a good reason why people were on the distribution list.  Also I find it quite annoying if I put someone on the list and a responder omits them.  Happens mostly with people who lack enough email experience or etiquette or are just not smart enough or careful enough to think what they are doing and the author of the article seems to be among those.",1196445172

In exploratory meetings your objective is very different than what it was in your first meeting with a partner at a fund. In your first meeting the objective is to get a VC interested enough to have you in for a second meeting. As a result, in the first meeting sharing too much information can be a mistake, if it distracts a VC from the big picture. This isn't the case in an exploratory meeting...",1196444814

What do you mean by 'players' - like, WinAmp / WMP / etc. or like other members of the site?  I use Amazon's music store, so that's kind of interesting to me.<p>\*Edit: I intermittently get ""t61.flashplayer.init is not a function"" error.  It prevents me from listening to music.

Forum posts are obviously going to be archived, and examined, and remain public.
Chat-rooms seem more of a grey area to me. I can see enormous use to archiving and mining the data, but on the other hand it does look slightly creepy being able to search and find some inane conversation I might have had months ago when I was in a silly mood.",1196443230

None of it was application-level programming until the Software Engineering track in senior year.  And you didn't have to have a full working program to pass either; it was enough to just show you made an effort.<p>I'd rather see a university that promoted the idea of letting self-motivated students do their own thing instead of just turning education into a checklist of required classes and credits.",1196442475

Storytellers and actors are experts at crafting personas and switching their minds in and out of them, but it's not an activity that's restricted to artists. Everyone does it.<p>I have an authorial voice when I write on HN. It isn't the same as the voice I use in the rest of the world. For one thing, I don't speak in carefully edited three-to-six paragraph essays.<p>I'm also a different person to my wife than I am to my coworkers, a different person at a funeral than I am at a blue-collar bar, and a different person when I'm healthy than when I'm in chronic pain.<p>This isn't some kind of lie. It's how human personality works: Your personality isn't some Platonic ideal that lives alone inside your head; it's embodied in flesh, conditioned on environment, and constantly retuning itself in reaction to society.<p>Your example undermines your point. Richard Feynman <i>deliberately adopted</i> a variety of public (and private) personas and switched between them depending on the circumstances. For example, he consciously adopted a different persona in front of a general audience than in front of other expert physicists. He <i>explicitly discusses</i> this in his book. After winning the Nobel Prize he would try to give a seminar, and they'd stick him in a huge auditorium full of everybody in town, and he'd feel so guilty about putting on his experts-only talk that he'd switch into his general-audience mode and give a general-audience talk. But he missed being able to give expert-level seminars so much that he started <i>giving seminars under a pseudonym</i>. Yes, he invented a handle. Very hackerly of him.",1282013966

I don't have any experience supporting myself on less (as before I made it to that tax bracket, I was living with my parents)  but I imagine the transition from\n$1/day to $2/day is even more dramatic.<p>Granted, my experiences living in that income tax bracket without parental support were mercifully short, but there's a pretty dramatic difference between making $10K/year and making $30K/year.<p>Also, I think your perceived earning ability has a lot to do with comfort levels.  Right now, I'm paying myself maybe $30K year... but I think it'd take about 20 minutes to get a $100K+/year job, if I could convince someone I was ready to work for them rather than for myself, which I think makes me quite a bit more comfortable than I would be otherwise... I have a safety net.   Maybe not quite as much of a safety net as a couple million in the bank, but it's still a pretty cushy net, and I use that net from time to time.  No matter how badly I fail, I know I can go get a cushy job that pays me far more money than I need without requiring me to work that hard.",1282013933

Using those bounds you can think about the limits to which reasons for crashes are not reflected, based on size of the time series of crashes.<p>I always think of efficient markets as an idea like a frictionless surface, an invalid, simplifying model to make the mathematics tractable.  So the question would be is the market close enough to efficient that well understood crashes are reasonably well reflected in it, most of the time: implying you should be thinking about something else.<p>I guess I should not believe in efficient markets since I work for a large active fund manager.<p>Our definition of ""weakly efficient"" is different that the paper you site.  Our definition is ""close enough to efficient to make exploitation infeasible"".  And I can't simultaneously believe in that, and believe in our products.",1282013868

In fact, my willingness to blame these atrocities on the men at the top if anything exonerates the people of these countries--I don't collectively blame the German people for the Holocaust so much as I blame the individual leaders of the Nazi cult.<p>FDR was many things, but he wasn't a totalitarian thug who ordered the execution of prisoners. If he was, the US likely would have been no better than its enemies. And the US did happen to commit atrocities during the Second World War as a matter of policy, just not against POW's or occupied territory.<p>Now, let's be clear on what you're asking for. Any order to plunder, torture, murder, <i>or</i> rape either prisoners of war or the people of an occupied nation issued by any military branch of Japan, Germany, or the USSR.<p>""Military"" does narrow it down a little bit--for instance, the only part of the SS that was really ""military"" was the Waffen-SS, which was separate from the SS departments that ran the concentration camps or rounded up the Jews. So I'm going to take the liberty of counting any state organization, including the SS and NKVD, not just the military itself.<p>Germany: If you're going to deny the Holocaust you're a very silly person and I'm not going to answer you.<p>Japan: Let's just start with Unit 731. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731</a> That's not the end of it, and it's barely the beginning, but all you asked for was an existence proof.<p>Russia: The Katyn Massacre (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre</a>), was carried out based upon orders signed by Stalin himself to murder Polish POW's and residents of Soviet-occupied Poland.

I agree that any of those titles you listed are very likely highly interesting, but exactly what is ""interesting"" is subjective. In no way did I mean to suggest books you enjoy to be inferior.

I doubt many people would consider Beethoven's 5th symphony inferior music, yet no one would consider it to make Billboard Music's top 20 list anytime soon, or more youths than you can count on one hand blasting it from their cars. In this way you can see what I mean is not inferiority, but rather a broader appeal to the overall market. To put it another way, operas make plenty of money, I'm sure, but I doubt their revenues compare with even low grossing movies. Would I like more people to be into reading, or operas? Yes, but that's not how things are.

It's very hard to notice absence of an indicator as a sign of danger, especially if there are are many normal situations where it's fine for the indicator to not be there. Imagine this design for a car engine warning light:<p>- Normally it's always off.\n- Whenever you turn left, it goes on if everything is fine.\n- However, if your engine needs service, then when you turn left, the warning light stays off.<p>Do you think this would do a good job of alerting people to engine trouble? Your suggestion is the same thing. It's hard to train yourself to notice the lock icon <i>not</i> appearing, even if you are very security-aware (which most users are not).<p>3) If the user has a bookmark, Top Sites/Speed Dial page, or URL autocomplete entry for the SSL URL to their bank, it's hard to redirect them to vanilla HTTP.

HN is all about startup culture -- building, iterating, and constantly exposing yourself to market forces to see what works. It's the basic principle that everyone here lives and works by.<p>I happen to share that opinion, but perhaps my opinion might have added value because I've spent years in the DC nonprofit world you mentioned. And I can say from experience that the non profit structure as it is conceived by most organizations today is detrimental to innovation and success. Non profit advocacy is broken. This is obviously a huge topic, but I will quickly just comment on your specific situation.<p>Your startup is a content play, right? Never mind the subject matter. Sure, it's about do-gooder environmental stuff, but at the end of the day, you have to play by the same rules as all other content providers. Whether you like it or not, you are competing with HuffPo, TMZ, I Can Haz Cheezburger, etc etc. You are competing for people's attention. Going the non profit route just seems like a way to fool yourself into thinking you are insulated from market forces, when there's truly no insulating yourself from them. So why fool yourself. Expose yourself to the market, it will make you better and will give you a clearer and quicker picture of what works and what doesn't. The idea that things that make the world a better place shouldn't have to play by the same rules is BS. That's just a good way for an organization to die a slow, clueless death.<p>My two cents.

In ""telling you what to do,"" Google would just be acting as an extension of your will—accessing all the same information you would access, and making all the same choices <i>the same way</i> you would make them. Just because the choices of what to do would come from the external world (and thus be determined) rather than from your mind (and thus ""feel"" more like you are in control of them) is no reason to reject those choices: they are still yours, even if they are determined.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism_and_incompatibilism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism_and_incompatibili...</a>",1282010589

Unfortunately the ratio of purchases to review seems to be about 70 to 1, at least for this app.<p>2. Dice roller was taken although die roller I think is open. I'll try to tailor the name,description, and keywords to more heavily trafficked related search terms. I did include some game names in the description which seems to help with search some.<p>3. I have a free version with iAds waiting for Apple review now. I'm hoping that will help supplement the revenue and also drive sales to the paid version. $10-20 CPM sounds great. I'm from a web background and traditional website CPM is nowhere near that.",1282010571

For this particular product I'd say it's even tougher.  A dice roller is simply not a mass market product.  So most of your advertising dollars are going to be wasted on people who don't care.<p>Asking sites for reviews and maybe even finding some D&D-type sites that would be willing to look at it and review it would be your best bet -- and just takes your time.<p>An ad-supported version may help visibility, but don't rely on iAds alone.  The fill rates are not high enough.  Alternatively, if there's a simple way to make a Lite version without giving away the whole thing, that can also be a way to get increased visibility.",1282010563

The name kind of says it all: Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected.<p>My friends were stationed in bases inside Iraq and never really had to do any &quot;off road-ing&quot;.

You can give me any data and tell me in what favor I need to give my inferences and I will get it out of the same data.<p>So I wont suggest to go with this conclusive analysis, rather look at the raw data and make your own sense.<p>Something about Marketing: You see one really cant compare A company with B company if their market and their strategies are different. Yes, they do intersect at some point and we need to see who wins at the intersection.<p>Example: \nApple is into: Computer + phone + mobile OS + Computer OS etc.<p>Apple V/s Android:\nWhen you compare Android with Apple: Compare iOS: And you will see that iOS is targeted to only a specific segment of society. Wherein Android is like a mass product. The reason Android is having higher market share is because in the third world country it is available as cheap as: 70$ V/s Apple (Iphone C) at  550$ (Both not on contract).<p>(Note: Android wont disrupt apple. These industry maturing will. With players having expertise in different domain come together to create final product. (Reference: Product interface) )<p>Apple V/s Samsung: \nSame story as above: Samsung is spurred across the segment (mass product) and hence claims to be having higher market share. Which is right. It might be more profitable.<p>Its like: Class / Higher Profits  V/s   Mass / Scale      =     Apple V/s  Samsung\n(Note: Look at it from a business perspective not user, and we see Samsung is a better model given current stage of market)<p>But here is an important learning: &quot;Elephants Cant Dance&quot; You see Apple is now a BIG established Brand. They have Brand equity (Reason they can charge higher prices).  Their Market segment is fix and they cant afford t dance / change now, to say Mass / Scale. It will hurt current market (Existing customer) sentiment. Though iPhone 5C was an attempt to try and gravitate towards Lower end market.<p>Back to Clayton theory:<p>1. He talks about theory as Lenses. Which doesn&#x27;t necessarily indicate that what you see through that lenses is right or wrong. You are free to choose some other lenses as you deem fit.<p>Looking through the lens of disruptive innovation: I will side him.

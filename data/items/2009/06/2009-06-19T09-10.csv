664889,comment,664815,664870,0,0,Tichy,,,"However, except for the AppStore, are there any portals that are really that good on bringing in customers? Granted, I have checked Kongregate for a while, but by now I don't feel much like going to their site just to see if they have any new games.<p>I am much more likely to play another game if it comes up as a recommendation on HN or maybe Twitter or something.<p>There are also different kinds of games. Maybe the average crappy flash game is a hard sell (and I went to the PopCap site which was mentioned as the star of flash gaming in the article, and I still don't think those games are very good - though maybe calling them PopCrap would be a bit too harsh). But some multiplayer browser games might be in a completely different category, people might join because their friends join and so on.<p>Game can fulfill a need, too - which is also why many people get into games development, because none of the existing games satiate their needs. It is just that the need for yet another desktop tower defense or tetris clone might be on a sharp decline.",1245405528

664887,comment,664552,664800,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"That's absolutely right. So you want to deter everyone according to the severity of the ""crime"", right? Why do you want to deter poor people more than rich people? The damage is the same. If you punish one person with life long poverty and the other with a small reduction of pocket money, you won't achieve what you want. I don't want wealthy people speeding just because they can afford it as their speeding is just as dangerous as everyone elses.<p>It comes down to the concept of cost that you are using. What is cost? Dollars? I don't think so. It's how much of your living time you have to spend in order to pay for something. That's what fines should be related to.",1245405154

664883,comment,664721,664835,0,0,pieter,,,"With Apple's tools, they use a separate APN for tethering. This is like having another router (you can have another APN for MMS, for instance). All your iPhone traffic gets routed through your normal router, but the tethering traffic gets routed by your iPhone to the tethering APN.<p>AT&T can then see from their side how much data you've put through the normal APN and how much through the tethering APN, and charge you accordingly. This is also how some of the other iPhone carriers charge you per MB, or give you a monthly xGB limit.<p>The tethering hacks you see now just make the iPhone use the 'normal' APN for tethering traffic, which AT&T can't distinguish so easy. They might still be able to do it with deep packet analysis, but that probably costs a lot of money and might not be worth it.",1245404863

664873,comment,664866,664866,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I think there are two pillars on which to base such a decision.<p>1) What domain knowledge do you have and what do you like to do?<p>2) What's changing in the world and in the markets.<p>I'm convinced that personal knowledge of what's lacking in a particular business domain is invaluable. If you have that knowledge you know what people want and that trumps everything else.<p>If you don't know anything outside technology itself you could read the paper and look which sectors are in turmoil. I think the best sectors are the ones that are most mature and the ones that are least mature and growing fast.<p>The reason why the most mature are interesting is that the competition is weak. The competition there are the slowest most bureaucratic behemoths you can imagine. Look at why Apple or Google (or Skype to some degree) could so easily topple the powers of the media and telecoms industries. These industries are very mature, very slow to react and very convinced of their old broken ways. Or look at what happened in the airline industry. That's what you want.<p>[Edit] Just one example that I have come across recently. I don't know what it's like in the US, but here in europe the postal services are broken. We used to have state monopolies that were slow and didn't innovate but package delivery worked.<p>Now, the sender often contracts private delivery companies like DHL and they optimise exclusively to the sender's benefit (that's their customer after all). I received a computer from Dell recently. I was told to wait at home from 9 AM to 6 PM. That's outrageous. If I missed the delivery they would try again on the next business day and if that didn't work the package would go back to the sender. They knock, wait for 30 seconds and then they're off. If you're in the bathroom, that's your fault. You cannot collect the package anywhere. That's a broken system that needs a new business model and new logistics ideas.",1245403707

664870,comment,664815,664815,0,0,patio11,,,"There are a few issues here, and together they're major components of the stock explanation why I advise people to not get into games development.<p>All portals, including BigFish and the Apple AppStore, want to own the relationship with the customer.  You, the developer, are an interchangable cog in that plan -- you can always be replaced.  The customer comes to <i>their</i> storefront, <i>their</i> name shows up on the bill, the customer thinks they are doing business with <i>them</i>.<p>This is about as conducive to building your own brand loyalty as it would be if I grew up listening to Californication by Best Buy.  Want to develop a mailing list, a following, upsell users into other products of yours that they'll find interesting?  Well, that is going to be a little hard because the portal wants to do all these things and they'll actively prevent you from doing them.<p>To add insult to injury, you have to pay the portal 60% of your sale price.  (The portal will phrase this, of course, as ""We're generously going to allow you 40% of <i>our</i> sale price.""  Always remember, it is THEIR customer.)<p>Now, why would anybody put up with this?  Well, to be blunt, most programmers suck at marketing and think they can't do it themselves.  The portals do not suck at marketing and have distribution nailed.  Thus developers get in bed with the portals and, well, its all over but for the crying.<p>You are much, much better off if you sell software on your own website, assuming you can get people to actually visit it.  This is another reason why I warn people off of games: the ways I know which are really viable for small software publishers (SEO and CPC advertising) really really suck for games.  People don't search for software, they search for problems and solutions to problems, and nobody has a hole in their life that they know only a dragon-themed match-three game can fill.<p>Oh, the natural dynamics of games (constantly increasing asset quality expectations) plus the incentive of portals to drive volume by maximizing selection through stomach-turning churn rates means that the sales vs. time curve for them looks like walking off a freaking cliff.  This is unfortunate, because you can't do the ""fire, adjust aim, fire again"" learning process that categorizes most successful small software development.  And, since you're not building a brand or a list, you aren't really developing any assets which can be used to make the next product more successful or less of a crapshoot.<p>On pricing: far too many people who play games have expectations for truly staggering development budgets to justify minor expenditures, and that is ignoring the large contingent who will steal the software given half the chance.  Getting $2.50 on a product which took $100k of implied labor (a man-year for a single senior developer, not really that hard to imagine for a game) is just painful to think about.<p>Back in the real world, because you're addressing problem-sized holes in people's lives, you can charge more.  A LOT more.  I think at least a thousand people have bought Bingo Card Creator for $30.  I get to keep about $28.85 of that, less expenses.  The math gets more attractive than $2.50 a unit in a hurry.  (Not to mention that $30 is, ahem, fairly cheap.  You should see developer tools or B2B.)<p>Meanwhile, I get to keep a bit of a springboard towards future products and, of course, improvements.",1245403207

I've noticed the main emphasis and primary factor for success is deciding which markets and industries to go into.<p>My question is, if this is true, where do I begin this process of doing research on markets and industries?  Of course googling and possibly paying commercial services for data is one method, but as a first time entrepreneur attempting to go into new markets and industries, I find it very hard to really find concrete information, data, and whether or not it really is the right time and idea to go into a specific market and industry.<p>Are there certain markets and industries you would recommend?  Right now financial concerns (living expenses, financial barrier to entry for a specific market/industry) are not a problem, but obviously going into a market with a lower barrier of cost would be less risk, especially for my experiences of creating a business.",1245402975

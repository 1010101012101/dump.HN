Although that makes sense for things like a license to drive a car, I don&#x27;t think it makes sense for teaching since teaching (in my opinion) is an art. It would be silly to provide licensing for people to practice art or a similarly creative endeavor.<p>Admittedly anecdotal, but I&#x27;ve asked a few teacher friends if graduate school has made them better teachers and all have answered that it hasn&#x27;t. Rather, they would insist that it&#x27;s a more organic experience of learning through teaching over time and experimenting with the medium. Perhaps it&#x27;s just that teacher education in America is fragmented and ineffective but I think it&#x27;s just the nature of most art that the skill can&#x27;t be acquired in an academic setting.<p>To me the ultimate effectiveness measure is if parents choose to send their kids to that school or students sign up for that class voluntarily.",1419814736

I can&#x27;t emphasise this enough.<p>Based on my own experiences, one school we were at had terrible teachers and an average principal ... and terrible results.  The other school was progressive and built confidence into everything the students did (eg. a school fair fund-raiser was completely organised and run by ALL of the primary school students).\nI now live in an area with one of the highest academic performance relative to the wealth of the families, Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (ICSEA).

Mandarin is great- loads of fun to learn and speak. My problem is that I meet a lot of highly skilled professionals who don’t do more in China because knowledge of Chinese is often held up as an “obvious” prerequisite. I have met countless people who move here and waste a year with flashcards instead of making things because they are convinced that being bilingual will make them successful in China (hint: it won’t). Investing your time in doing things the Chinese can’t do very well will make you successful in China- and there is no shortage of bilingual Chinese.<p>You can get the Mediatek MT6260 (or just about anything else) without speaking Chinese, by using Google/Baidu/Bing Translate and relying on the spectacular patience of Chinese people for these things.

Of course- but should you give up on doing things in the amazing development environment of China just because you don’t have a gift for languages? Certainly not.<p>That being said- Bunnie is the Man",1419814322

When you post a card you infect a few people who are closest to you.<p>Then those people see it as a card, and decide whether to swipe up to infect more people close to them, or swipe down to ignore.<p>If you make something popular and people tend to swipe up 25% or more of the time, it slowly will spread across the world.<p>I live in Sydney, so with a faily dense userbase here, the first infections are in the same city. However if you live somewhere without any users nearby the infections will go further geographically to find the nearest 4 or so people.<p>The more success you have with infecting people, the more your infection index goes up, and so the more people you infect when you post or swipe up.<p>In addition there are comments on cards. If you make a comment you get subscribed to the card and altered on further comments. You can unsubscribe from a card when this gets annoying.<p>==== Expect to see ====<p>► Memes copied from other sites. This leads to popular cards complaining about this, and saying to not upswipe memes.<p>► More memes.<p>► Even more memes.<p>► Inspirational quotes, mostly cliche but sometimes something new.<p>► Pet cats, dogs as expected.<p>► Pretty women, boobs, etc.<p>► Holiday photos.<p>► A small amount of politics.<p>► Screenshot of a plague card, which someone else takes a screenshot of so you get a recursion. Those are really boring now!<p>► More Memes.<p>► Vary rarely inappropriate things - NSFW, porn, hatred etc. The system seems good at self policing that kind of rubbish.<p>==== What is it for ====<p>In my opinion it is for mindless entertainment. The same way you may hang out on Facebook for an hour because you are bored. This fills a boredom hole and can get addictive, especially with the gamification of rewards (higher infection ability) for creating new messages and getting to argue with strangers about pointless stuff.<p>For this reason alone I decided to uninstall.",1419813351

8808032,comment,8807290,8807290,0,0,shalmanese,,,"I think there are two separate viewpoints, both useful, neither true, that can be used to understand the structuring of stories. The viewpoint espoused in this article is that there exist certain timeless structures, imposed by the form that inextricably results in a type of output. And that the job of a writer is to discover these forms and work within them.<p>There&#x27;s another line of argument, made by Steven Johnson in Everything Bad is Good for You, where viewers are trained by the media to read texts in a more sophisticated fashion. As viewers become more media savvy, the desire for surprise causes a constant creative arms race as structures that were once avant garde becomes commonplace, then tired, then old fashioned.<p>The A/B plot mentioned in the article is only about 40 years old (starting with Hill St Blues in 1981). Prior to that, television comedy followed a strict single line for fear of confusing the audience. Nowadays, it&#x27;s not uncommon to see a sitcom go up to E plots. What&#x27;s allowed them to do that is that television has developed increasingly dense visual shorthand that allows them to speed through a plot even faster, allowing for more story to fit into those 22 minutes.<p>Previous constraints on syndication meant that characters were required to remain in a stasis throughout the entire run but season long and series long arcs are now becoming the norm with even relatively retrograde sitcoms like The Big Bang Theory engaging in long term plotting.<p>If you look towards the cutting edge, you start to see people playing around with the traditional three act structure in interesting ways to keep the form fresh. How I Met Your Mother plays around with time and memory, sometimes establishing the conclusion at the front of the episode and then uses flashbacks to flesh out the central conflict in reverse. Louie routinely fits 2 or 3 stories into a single episode or stretches a single story across multiple episodes. Arrested Development S4 was an overly ambitious attempt to build a single, series long story, told and retold from multiple perspectives. And one of Girls&#x27; most polarizing episodes, One Man&#x27;s Treasure (the bottle episode where Hannah has a tryst with the rich doctor) was hated by some precisely because it rejected the standard formula and resolutely avoided going for a climax and resolution.<p>Such techniques follow the standard adoption cycle, first appearing in cutting edge, low rated comedies aimed at early adopters before eventually gaining widespread appeal and mainstream success before becoming hacky and relegated to shows for children and old people.",1419812964

8807977,comment,8806143,8807239,0,0,curun1r,,,"@ $99.99, the cost of posting that material free online is probably pretty close to zero. Every download does not represent lost revenue. Only those downloads that take the place of purchases do. How many people torrenting a movie would be willing to pay $99.99 for the BluRay? Not many. Those downloads become a lot more relevant as the cost of legally consuming content drops.<p>The thing that I&#x27;ve been continually amazed by is the industry&#x27;s fascination on eliminating or limiting people viewing their content without paying. This is a meaningless metric and one that puts them at odds with their customers. If they had, instead, focused on increasing the average amount that each person spends on content, they&#x27;d not only make more money, but they&#x27;d be in the business of giving customers what they want and they&#x27;d truly be taking advantage of the zero marginal cost of their product. As long as I&#x27;m spending as much as I&#x27;m willing to spend on entertainment, the industry should want me watching everything they produce. The per-view or per-piece-of-content profit is only meaningful in a world where each copy they sell costs them money. When me viewing a piece of content costs them nothing, they should only be concerned that I&#x27;m paying for content, not that I&#x27;m paying for each piece of content.",1419811663

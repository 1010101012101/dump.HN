1881309,comment,1880908,1881190,0,0,tzs,,,"Yes, he meant no NULL anywhere. The relational model as originally formulated by E.F. Codd did not have NULL. It was only much later that some tried to extend it by adding NULL (or even two different kinds of NULL).<p>In Date's book ""Database in Depth"" he gives some wonderful examples of how NULL in SQL breaks things. One I recall involved a couple simple tables and a simple question about the data. There were something like half a dozen or so reasonable ways one might write a query to answer the question--and there were many different answers depending on the exact query.<p>""Database in Depth"" has been updated and refocused more on SQL, and is now called ""SQL and Relational Theory"". He sums up in the latter book the problem with NULL thusly:<p><pre><code>    To sum up: If you have any nulls in your database, then
    you’re getting wrong answers to certain of your queries.
    What’s more, you have no way of knowing, in general,
    just which queries you’re getting wrong answers to and
    which not; all results become suspect. You can never
    trust the answers you get from a database with nulls.
    In my opinion, this state of affairs is a complete
    showstopper.</code></pre>",1289188349

The ease of mixing content means that many sites get it wrong (including Google sites, to our shame) and the lack of ubiquitous SSL (again, including some Google sites) imposes that on others.<p>So, I suppose that `we don't consider it a problem' is roughly correct regarding warning dialogs: the answer is not to mix content. The problem is that it's clearly too difficult to do that. (The inability of networks to cache public resources over HTTPS is also an issue and possibly one which we'll address.)<p>Lack of SSL on the Chart's API is a new one, but I'll look into it now that I know that it's a problem.<p>As for the rest of the problem: fixing stuff is hard.

I mean, he could loose his job, while for me, the worst that would happen is my friends would tease me a bit.<p>Really, ""what you would be willing to do when other people are watching""  is often a reasonable ethical shorthand for 'the right thing'   -  allowing people to (optionally)  release the recording of their interaction with law enforcement would go a long ways towards reducing abuses by law-enforcement.<p>On the other hand, what I'm really afraid of is getting put on some secret list, and video taping doesn't protect me from that.",1289188095
1881295,comment,1880467,1880467,0,0,Udo,,,"No amount of ""sensitivity training"" and related measures will change the behavior of psychopaths. The reason big companies have harassment seminars and rules of conduct is not to prevent this from happening, they need this to cover their asses legally when it does happen, and if at all possible to send a message to their employees that they better not be covering this shit up when the time comes.<p>Converting the open source community (or any community for that matter) into a paranoid kindergarten isn't gonna do anything besides make people miserable. Almost everyone already knows that this kind of behavior is not within the normal range of human interaction, no training necessary. And I suspect those who do not know this to begin with cannot be trained to reliably behave acceptably and normally, no matter how much effort is put into this.<p>Psychopaths don't need to be educated, they need to stay at home and take their meds.<p>If all that holds a guy back from acting like a retarded, violent asshole is a bunch of rigid rules and the threat of public shame, his true self will come out eventually no matter how much you invested in sensitivity training. Personality disorders cannot be treated with awareness campaigns. It's not like these people have somehow just missed the memo on how not to mistreat others and are then magically socialized once that information has been provided.<p>On a side note, I'm sick of (and kind of surprised by) this notion that all men are supposed to be like this by default and just have to restrain themselves all the time so as not to degenerate into drooling monkeys who rape everything in sight. And it's not just women putting this theory out there, I've seen quite a lot of male creeps on LifeJournal threads ""confessing"" to this kind of personality over the last few days.

It may not be sexual assault in the legal sense when the TSA does it, but that's partially because you can be said to have consented. If someone else is ""forcing you to consent"" (quoted for oxymoronicity) then that is a different thing altogether, and given the extreme attention the law pays to sexual harassment in the workplace it would not surprise me that while the government and the TSA agents are indemnified, your company may not be.<p>Actually, let me refine that to merely point out that one could plausibly file a very expensive and uncomfortable-to-your-employer lawsuit over this; I wouldn't guarantee victory, but I wouldn't guarantee defeat, either.",1289187896

It looks almost identical apart from a VERY distracting list of of your friends' Facebook profile pics down the left hand side, and equally distracting ""unread"" counts from your Facebook and Twitter feeds on the right.<p>The oddest thing is that this browser seems to <i>require</i> that you log in to Facebook to start it -- at least, I didn't see a cancel button. The next time Facebook has an outage that's going to be really interesting (also, I can imagine people who work at Facebook QA will confuse the hell out of it).<p>The bookmarks bar is disabled by default. Instead, your bookmarks are integrated into the ""about:blank"" page, which is an interesting idea. However, I am a heavy user of bookmarklets (delicious/tumblr/awe.sm), which need to be in a real bookmark bar to be able to work, so I needed to enable the bookmarks bar, a setting which is a little buried.<p>The Twitter client is activated by hitting the ""unread tweets"" button on the right hand side. The client is full-featured if a little rough-edged right now -- but if I'm in a browser already, why wouldn't I just have a tab with Twitter's excellent web client open? Likewise the Facebook client. It's maybe saving me one click, but if I have my Facebook/Twitter tabs closed it's because I'm trying to get some work done, so the unread counts don't help.<p>There are some interesting potential features in here, though. The right-hand side allows you to add feeds for other websites, which is a potentially powerful idea. The integrated sharing tools are extremely slick -- maybe if they provided a way for websites to automatically integrate their own sharing tools I wouldn't miss the bookmarks bar so much.<p>I'll give it a few more hours, but my initial impressions are mixed at best.",1289187841

We plan on working over the weekend on this recovery, and hope to have more news for you shortly.<p>As of 22nd Oct 2010 data recovery is STILL ongoing. The Western Digital Caviar Green 2TB drive that failed has chemical degredation on the surface making the data recovery much slower and harder.
All going well, we will have the older backups making sense soon, and will be back up to speed.<p>As of Nov 4th, we have been unable to bring the site back up yet, due to the discovery that the older backups bring brought online would end up with a number of users being unable to access their games due to copy protection issues.

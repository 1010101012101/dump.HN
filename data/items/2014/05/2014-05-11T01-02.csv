It was simple, add a tap to the fiber coming into our network (we had redundant fiber connections to our particular little niche of a network, and conveniently, there were taps on the market that would aggregate the traffic from both fiber connections), pipe it to a monitoring server and run the logging + monitoring tool of your choice.<p>My boss barely understood what I was doing, his superiors certainly didn&#x27;t know anything about it.  We were not part of what would be considered the university IT department either -- we were just some random organization within the university.  Who knows how many different people on hops above us were doing the same thing.  And I was capturing the full traffic (not metadata) of people who would normally take even <i>extra</i> offense at this sort of thing going on.  Not because the traffic contained SSNs or credit card details or something like that, but because the traffic was sensitive in a more private, personal way (I can&#x27;t go into the particular details any more).<p>Unfortunately, this brief story doesn&#x27;t have a juicy ending.  I didn&#x27;t do anything nefarious with the data.  I didn&#x27;t use it to spy on anyone.  I simply used it to watch out for attacks against services on our network -- I thought I was doing something positive for the users of our services.  But reading the parent post made me pause for a moment and consider that all these things I&#x27;m reading about and taking issue with in the news today (the NSA, eavesdropping, etc), that I did something similar, albeit on a much, much, smaller scale myself, many years ago when I was younger and more naive.",1399772606

7727371,comment,7726923,7726923,37,0,tzs,,,"&quot;Tort reform&quot; can seriously screw over people, because the parties that tend to favor tort reform (by which they mean greatly limiting the ability of people to sue and/or the amount they can win if they do sue) also tend to favor limiting government regulation and oversight. That can leave nothing to compensate for the removal of the deterrence factor that the threat of lawsuits provides against bad corporate or professional behavior.<p>A sad example is provided by Texas. Protection against bad doctors was provided in Texas by three things: the Texas Medical Board, malpractice suits, and hospital managers. The legislature greatly limited the amount patients can win in malpractice suits, and they made it so hospitals cannot be held liable for hiring incompetent doctors unless the plaintiff can prove the hospital knew the doctor was an extreme risk and ignored this--and they made it so the plaintiff usually cannot get access to the documents that would be needed to prove this.<p>This shifted most of the burden of protecting Texans from bad doctors to the Texas Medical Board, which was not designed for that. It was more designed for licensing and ensuring that doctors keep with standards, not for investigating bad doctors. The Medical Board was not given any more resources to deal with this new and heavy workload, and so bad doctors could practice much longer than they would have been able to before the legislature decided to do their tort reform.<p>This article on the Dr. Christopher Duntsch case shows who wrong this can go: <a href=""http://www.texasobserver.org/anatomy-tragedy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.texasobserver.org/anatomy-tragedy/</a>",1399771517

McD coffee in an insulated cup is still nicely hot by the time I get to work. When I make tea, or coffee with my Aeropress, I use boiling water right out of the kettle. I agree with GP, coffee should be HOT.",1399770323

Most of these sources claim that their temperature is &#x27;industry-standard&#x27;. I haven&#x27;t been able to find an origin for any of these claims beyond the Specialty Coffee Association of America [0], who claim a standard &#x27;cupping temperature&#x27; of 200+-2 degrees F.<p>Can anyone provide a <i>reliable</i> source for whether or not there is a standard temperature for coffee (and what that temperature is, if it exists)? Obviously, a certain degree of variance is expected based on the time between brewing and serving - if the variance really is ~50 degrees F, I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with that answer if it&#x27;s sourced.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.scaa.org/?page=resources&d=cupping-standards"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scaa.org/?page=resources&d=cupping-standards</a>",1399770251

McDonalds was grossly negligent in serving their coffee at a temperature well above necessary, hotter than anyone in the industry. Starbucks won&#x27;t even brew your coffee that hot (if you ask for anything over 180 degrees they may say yes, but won&#x27;t actually do it).<p>Much of these cases is based on reasonable expectation. Would you ever expect your coffee to be so hot that it could melt your skin? No.",1399770157

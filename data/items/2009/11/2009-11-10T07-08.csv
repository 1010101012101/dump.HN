932651,comment,932385,932385,0,0,marcamillion,,,"This is cool. Sounds like you hit on an annoyance that HR managers/administrators have probably be struggling with for a long time. Especially for the companies large enough to have a headache, but not large enough to create a custom software solution.<p>Care to share some info on how this was created? Some of the technologies behind it, how long it took you, any insight would be cool. Would also love to hear how the launch went - e.g. a nice blog post with some interesting follow-up statistics on all sorts of HN related metrics would be nice to see.<p>I like how easy it is for me to know immediately what it is and what problem it solves.<p>Me, personally, I find the green on white copy - right below the main centerpiece of the main page - a bit hard on the eyes. Maybe that green could be a SHADE darker - so there is more contrast?<p>Just being nit-picky here, I feel like some of the copy is a bit wordy and some of the word choices are a bit awkward. E.g. 'Personable Time Off'....what on earth is that? After looking through the site, I get what you are going for, but I am not sure if that is the best way to say it.<p>The interface definitely looks nice though, and for the most part the copy is relatively easy to read.<p>I am also struggling to decide whether or not there is too much information on the main page. At first, I was like 'Whoa!' this is a lot, but I realized that you are just saying the same thing many different ways without me knowing you are saying it many different ways until I understand everything - if that makes sense. So I guess in a way it's good, because before even moving from the first page I understood what the app is about, but I would have preferred if the same could be explained without so many words.<p>Just my $0.02.",1257839507

Why should a writer's legacy to his children be less than a grocer's?  If he had created a bank, an advertising agency or a law firm, these too might have outlived him, and no one would question his right to pass his stake down to his family.<p>I don't necessarily <i>buy</i> that argument, because income from creative works is purely residual in nature, and has no special value in the hands of anyone but the original author (except for whatever a publisher can continue to milk from it.)

932636,comment,932313,932462,0,0,ejames,,,"I think you overestimate Apple's competence... or, more specifically, the breadth of the fields to which applies.<p>Apple is very competent at making things for consumers, and not particularly good at working with developers or corporate IT.<p>I tend to agree that the App Store is being used by Apple as a tool to market more iPhones and not as a way for the iPhone to become a successful software platform for developers.  But I think that's more because Apple is flailing to figure out how exactly the App Store should work; remember that it wasn't originally planned to exist at all.  Companies need practice at managing developer ecosystems in the same way that individuals need practice at any other skill.<p>I feel that Apple made the App Store without really predicting or understanding how it would work out.  When it turned out to be a great marketing tool for the iPhone but not a very good platform, Apple used the ""There's an app for that"" slogan.  Making the hardware attractive to consumers was the App Store's strongest feature... naturally enough, for a system built by a company that earns alls its money by making hardware attractive to consumers.<p>When all you have is a hammer, only the nail-shaped parts of your product ever really get done.

Perq comes from our own fruitless search...""<p>should be: ""Perq was inspired by our own need...""<p>* Not so much text on the main page. As another commenter said, I don't want to see a list of every feature that you provide. <i>If</i> I'm interested in your product after the first page <i>then</i> I'll want to see a detailed feature list.<p>* Take the pop-up that comes up when you click ""View Details"" on the Tour page, and embed it into the page.

932625,comment,913993,914587,0,0,SeanLuke,,,"As a computer science professor, I have to say that this misreads the article.<p>Oh sure, computer science, and especially certain subfields like software engineering and languages, reinvent the wheel all the time.  A new fad comes in and its proponents are too egotistical, or too lazy, to be bothered realizing it's the same as an old fad.  This happens largely because the literature of computer science is exceptionally broad and not very deep.  But this is hardly special to CS: it's common practice in engineering.  More to the point, it doesn't have anything to do with what the author was on about.<p>What the author was talking about is the tendency, in mathematics, for the entire field to become balkanized into small groups with little interdisciplinary crosstalk and a disturbing degree of inbreeding.  Many departments consist of specialists who cannot, or will not, talk to one another about their work.  Sometimes no one understands what anyone else is doing or talking about.  That's the claim anyway, and I have no reason to doubt it from what I've seen myself.<p>Computer science is <i>nothing like this</i>.  Even computer science theory is highly interdisciplinary, application-oriented, and accessible to the mainstream CS audience (or at least to CS academics).  In my department, I can talk to every single faculty member, reasonably intelligently, about what they are doing and how it is relevant to others.  I can read their papers and more or less understand them.  And I'm not some kind of uberprofessor, quite to the contrary.  It's just that the field isn't very deep yet.",1257837261

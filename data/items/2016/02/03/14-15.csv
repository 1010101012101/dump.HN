How would you want to host it and customize it?<p>Would you want any social features besides roles and permissions? Such as quoting content from others, or pingbacks or something?<p>Finally, generate static files or just cache heavily?

IATED has the potential to do really bad things if insecure.  Letting a malicious page read random files on your file system (or worse, write them!) is the obvous vector.<p>* I would want to support the same platforms: Linux, OS X, and Windows.  But each platform has very different requirements. Windows users are going to be confused if IATED is purely command line driven, for example.<p>* What language should I write it in. I have several false starts, with the current &#x27;master&#x27; branch being JRuby.  But depending on the JVM seems horrible.  &#x27;golang&#x27; is pretty new and maybe the way to go.

It is a further development of Wendelstein 7-AS. The purpose of Wendelstein 7-X is to evaluate the main components of a future fusion reactor built using stellarator technology, even if Wendelstein 7-X itself is not an economical fusion power plant.<p>The Wendelstein 7-X reactor is the largest fusion device created using the stellarator concept which was the brainchild of physicist Lyman Spitzer. It is planned to operate with up to 30 minutes of continuous plasma discharge, demonstrating an essential feature of a future power plant: continuous operation.<p>The name of the project, referring to the mountain Wendelstein in Bavaria, was decided at the end of the 1950s, referencing the preceding project from Princeton University under the name Project Matterhorn.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendelstein_7-X"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendelstein_7-X</a>",1454509317

But the main limitation is &quot;delta V&quot;, or the effective speed change you can achieve with a particular quantity of fuel.<p>The Mariner 10 trip did it in 5 months, which is reasonable. The article doesn&#x27;t mention Mercury at all. A minimum-fuel trip to Mars is estimated at 3 years, I believe.<p>Wikipedia:<p>> Another reason why so few missions have targeted Mercury is that it is very difficult to obtain a satellite orbit around the planet on account of its proximity to the Sun, which causes the Sun’s gravitational field to pull on any satellite that would be set into Mercury&#x27;s orbit. Furthermore, spacecraft naturally accelerate as they approach the greater gravitational pull of the Sun, but must slow down for orbit insertion, so this entails considerable fuel requirements. This is different with superior planets beyond Earth’s orbit where the satellite works against the pull of the Sun. Therefore, reaching an orbit around Mercury requires especially expensive rocketry. Mercury&#x27;s lack of an atmosphere poses further challenges because it precludes aerobraking or the use of a parachute type device.[3] Thus a landing mission would have even more demanding fuel requirements.",1454508064

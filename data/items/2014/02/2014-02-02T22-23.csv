7167987,comment,7167719,7167893,7,0,_delirium,,,"As far as income taxes that&#x27;s true. However the NFL&#x27;s current nonprofit status means it avoids taxes that most other entities (individuals or businesses) would have to pay even if not profitable, such as sales tax. Many (most?) states allow nonprofits to show a tax-exempt ID number at places like Wal-Mart or at hotels, and have sales, occupancy, and other taxes removed. The motivation, I believe, was to provide in effect a subsidy to the work of organizations like the Red Cross, by reducing their expenses.<p>That can be solved at the state level, however. The states do not <i>have</i> to defer to the federal government&#x27;s classification of 501(c) tax-exempt organizations when choosing who to exempt from state taxes. They could adopt a more stringent state-level definition. Or they could still defer to the federal categories, but a more restrictive subset. For example, a state could limit tax exemptions to 501(c)(3) charities (which have more stringent requirements), and not exempt 501(c)(6) organizations like the NFL. (Considering what kind of stuff slips into 501(c)(6), this is probably a good idea beyond just the NFL case.)",1391381984

7167956,comment,7161901,7165687,3,0,belorn,,,"The argument you put forth has already been done against the case of used car salesmen/saleswomen. The argument is that those people rely on reputation to sell successfully, and thus reviews from previous buyers will fill in the gap of information asymmetry to new buyers.<p>If the customer collects the critical information about the product from other buyers before purchase, information asymmetry can always (even with used cars) be removed. However, the buyer must also in practice be able to assess the value of a product through examination before purchase. If consumers in the general case do not inform themselves by reviews and shared customer experience, information asymmetry will happen.<p>So when a game is released with horrible user reviews or below working condition, they still tend to sell perfectly well. Even in cases where the developers themselves has admitted the poor state and given refunds, the games sell perfectly well. In a world with information asymmetry in games, Simcity and Rome 2 can be commercial successes, and even Ride to hell sells copies.<p>If you believe that there is no information asymmetry in games, how do you explain the discrepancy between reality and theory?",1391381443

We use phone numbers of SMS, but really we use individual address books, stored in devices, or synchronized with central repositories. We use names to identify people and have to work hard to ensure that our address books are not filled up with duplicates created because we used a one-off email address, or phone number and the phone wasn&#x27;t able to merge it with an existing contact automatically. We have identity providers that can only represent a small portion of our identity, real names on Facebook and Google+, but cannot resolve that back to our phone numbers or find the best way to contact us at any given time. Presence, which was the real promise of IM and XMPP (and SIMPLE if you must)  is not integrated. I cannot determine before hand whether somebody is available to talk on the phone, would prefer a text message, or if I should leave a push voice message they can listen to at their leisure.<p>Even calling a company with a well designed IVR is still a confusing waste of time, when the device I am calling that system from is smart enough to contain any identifier or proof of identity that the called party would need, the protocols are artificially limited to phone numbers as identifiers. There is also no out of band solution to this problem, or the the problem of selecting what department I would prefer to speak with about a problem without navigating a menu that the interface on my device is not really designed to use.

Storing data in a scalable and secure manner is not an easy problem, but the business model of these kinds of companies kind of rely on making it seem like an easy problem, leading people into horrible implementations without guidance or often even the tooling required for security.)<p>Now, clearly: that didn&#x27;t keep you from being successful, so nothing I&#x27;m saying should detract from the &quot;lesson&quot; here being learned, even by your specific example; but, this is a <i>bug</i> in the way people interact with product marketing that depresses me to no end daily: that people who wait to include <i>critical</i> functionality--not something optional like &quot;object counts&quot; but something absolutely core to the value proposition of &quot;manage your application&#x27;s data without running your own server&quot; such as &quot;user login&quot; and server-enforced permissions--in the end can often get screwed by being &quot;beaten to the customer mindset&quot; by someone who decides &quot;engh, unimportant&quot; and decided they could &quot;iterate&quot; on security or safety features once already deployed :(.",1391381158

Some sites will ask for at least 8 characters, mix of uppercase and lowercase, one occurence of non-alphanumeric character and the password is at least certain length. Some even go as far as no repeating characters or max password length (8-15 characters).<p>While the intention is great, it makes password so hard to remember and people are less likely<p>2. every website runs its own password management. How the heck can I tell website X is actually hashing my password and doing it correctly? I can&#x27;t.<p>Persona - single identity is probably the way to go. Adding multi-factor auth will be great. But again, I argue that password by itself is not entirely broken. If the attacker can access the database directly by ssh into the server, then there is also a possibility that the app server can be compromised and therefore alerting app code is just a finger tip away. This is the highest level of attack and the story is over at this stage.<p>I personally think password is not entirely broken. It has value. By itself it may not be as strong as having multi--step authentication. Authenticating yourself with key-only, or device-key only is the worst thing ever. It&#x27;s like running EC2 instance. If I delete the instance&#x27;s key off my computer, I will cry.<p>So keeping infrastructure secure is important. Multi-factor authentication on the server side is critical.

7167807,comment,7166564,7166564,1,0,adregan,,,"I switched from teaching to development (front end) in the last year. My background is in literature and I taught poetry at universities in America (adjunct) and I taught general lit. at an international school in Japan for a few years. Even though I loved teaching, I quit for a few reasons.<p>- I gave serious thought to what kinds of projects I&#x27;d like to be working on in 5 years, and discovered that I wanted to contribute to society on a larger scale—I wanted to affect more lives.<p>- Teaching didn&#x27;t allow for constant iteration. I couldn&#x27;t test out new ideas as quickly as I would like. If I blew a lesson, I&#x27;d have to wait another year to try and make it better.<p>- The institutions felt slow to adapt and change, and there was constantly push back when I tried to do something different.<p>- I completely understand the feeling of burning out—it&#x27;s very real for teachers (and students)—but the worst feeling that comes with teaching is how sad it is every year to say goodbye to your students after spending so much time investing in their well being.<p>I really enjoy front end development and user interaction, and on top of that I find programming creatively satisfying, but it was hard to figure out how to get my foot in the door, so here&#x27;s the approach I took.<p>Stay focused—once you start getting down the rabbit hole, try not to get distracted by all of the cool stuff you find. I was constantly tempted by other languages and platforms (iOS development always looks so great), but I really wanted to be a front end dev (I was getting back into it after years away), so I had to put on blinders and really focus on the core front end stack.<p>Learn your tools—finding out the baseline of knowledge for the field you want to enter is paramount, but so is learning how to use the tools. I think having grunt in my toolbox has been paramount in allowing me to level up quickly—learning best practices by osmosis.<p>Don&#x27;t let being a teacher work against you—After years of trying to teach students to appreciate weirdo obscure lit, I learned to pay attention and ask better questions. I learned that my first instincts about how to do things was usually wrong, and I had to be willing to kill my darlings. For me, this skill manifests itself when architecting UI or thinking about user experience. Using software for the user is like learning something new. How can you set the user up to succeed. This is taken from my cover letter:<p>&quot;What a teacher or a developer/designer should do is help a user recognize patterns and give them enough information to fill in any gaps and reaffirm what they already know. However, it&#x27;s difficult to know where you should begin, when you should take a step back and simplify an abstract concept. That&#x27;s why a teacher or a developer&#x27;s main task is to observe, ask questions, and take feedback—to swallow one&#x27;s ego and remain flexible.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;ve been teaching for more than a week, you know how to swallow your ego and take feedback. On top of that, you&#x27;re likely very patient. These are strengths you developed via teaching.<p>A further strength you&#x27;ve developed is the ability to _teach_. Developing is ripe with teaching opportunities. You likely write great documentation, great code comments, and do so in a way that is very complete without making someone feel as though you&#x27;re talking down to them.<p>You&#x27;re also pretty good a planning a project. I always felt that 80% of good teaching was due to adequate preparation. I&#x27;ve been honing this skill and taking advantage of my tooling to help me architect my projects. For example, assume you&#x27;re working on a project which will be used in multiple instances. The core will remain the same but the outward manifestation will change from instance to instance. Good planning beforehand will likely aid you in maintaining that project in the future (so you don&#x27;t have forks on top of forks).<p>And I&#x27;ll return to patience. Teaching is probably the hardest job in the world, and you&#x27;ve learned to be patient. This is a huge asset. Play it up.<p>You&#x27;re not going to try to convince these companies that you&#x27;re a good fit despite your experience teaching but because of it. Apply for positions where they will see a real benefits from your teaching experience. Perhaps something where your work will interface with users. You probably won&#x27;t enjoy a job where your work exists behind the scenes and is largely esoteric. You&#x27;ve got that education itch to scratch, and it probably won&#x27;t ever go away.<p>You need someone to take a chance on you; make the conversation about your strengths (of which there are likely many).<p>(One caveat: I quit my teaching job before I had a programming job and spent a few months trying to bring my skills up to an appropriate before applying to positions. This was a very scary time, but in the end it paid off. It was a big leap, and it worked out, but nerve wracking nonetheless)<p>Good Luck.",1391378664

For a company who can&#x27;t afford a full-time CTO, however, having a virtual CTO means that they get access wealth of experience that they&#x27;d otherwise never be able to afford. A startup who&#x27;s business is based on technology in any meaningful way absolutely needs someone to fill that role—you can&#x27;t (or shouldn&#x27;t) just trust that a run-of-the-mill contractor is going to deliver what you think you&#x27;re getting, and you probably aren&#x27;t qualified to determine whether they are or not.  This is the main reason outsourced projects end badly. Having a virtual CTO isn&#x27;t as good as having a technical cofounder, but its a damn sight better than having no technical members on the team at all.",1391378515

The study of sex is a massive field in evolution, and it is not a young science.

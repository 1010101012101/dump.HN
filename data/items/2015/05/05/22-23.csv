9495523,comment,9494169,9495211,0,0,shredprez,,,"Fitness and fatness have a subjective relationship with beauty, but there is an objective relationship between extremes in weight (from over- or under-eating) and health. While the exact relationship is a little different for each of us, eating too much or too little is unhealthy for everyone.<p>Which is why this notion that weight can only be criticized or celebrated in the context of beauty is nonsense. You can be both beautiful and deeply unhealthy. And that&#x27;s what weight really is, a health issue. Hijacking genuine conversations about health and turning them into philosophical conversations about beauty is intellectually dishonest. It&#x27;s easy to dismiss subjective opinions about beauty. It&#x27;s difficult to address society-wide failures with weight management.<p>If we eradicated behaviors like starving and binging, issues of unhealthy beauty standards would nearly evaporate.

9495515,comment,9493407,9494788,0,0,RogerL,,,"I would say an answer of &quot;yes&quot; is a huge red flag. A good CEO needs to understand risk/reward. VCs are investing in risky things, and thus distribute their cash amongst hundreds of start ups, fully aware that most will go to zero. It doesn&#x27;t matter because 1 will go to $1 billion.<p>OTOH, family usually can&#x27;t afford to lose what they give. They make emotional decisions, not financially rational ones.<p>If a CEO can&#x27;t distinguish those entire distinguish those entirely different cases I doubt their financial acumen. You go to VC for moon shots, to the bank for proven business models, and to family and friends to build a family &#x27;lifestyle&#x27; and asset heavy businesses (asset heavy so you can recoup some of the money if your business fails).<p>No one rational should believe that their startup will succeed no matter what. We know, with certainty, that it almost certainly <i>will</i> fail. It&#x27;s a flutter - a bet on a fabulous future (fabulous in terms of success, making a difference, huge wads of cash, whatever).

I happen to be homeless and I know there are other people here who are struggling in the present -- pleas for help sometimes show up here by people in real trouble -- and I know there are people here who have been homeless in the past.<p>As a nation, we need to work on putting together a better social safety net and we need to work on making a whole lot more affordable housing available. I don&#x27;t recall the exact figures off the top of my head, but the number of available affordable housing units is some relatively small percentage of demand. This is in part because of the way taxes and financing and things like that are structured. It is in part because we have done away with a lot of affordable options in a lot of places, like SROs and boarding houses. The types of places young single people used to live largely no longer exist.<p>As a nation, our track record for caring for our children really sucks. This is a very poor policy that hurts the future of our country. We are churning out relatively large numbers of people with terrible childhoods and then wondering why so much fails to go smoothly. We are grinding up a very high percentage of future citizens and then expecting them to somehow solve it themselves. Aside from any moral concerns, this is just a terrible thing to do to ourselves as a nation. We are flushing a great deal of human capital down the toilet by caring so little about the welfare of our children.<p>Edit:<p>From the end of the article: <i>This also means that we need to de-stigmatize homelessness, so students in need will self-identify and get the help they need.</i><p>This is part of why I am open about being homeless, although I know that in the short term it hurts me. I would probably be taken more seriously here and other places if I weren&#x27;t open about being homeless currently. I was one of the top three students of my graduating high school class. I have about six years of college, including an AA and 2 certificates and I am a few classes short of a bachelor&#x27;s. But I realize that my lack of housing is something that convinces many people I am simply incompetent and I get dismissed and they move on. And that needs to change if things are ever going to improve in this country. As long as people figure homeless folks are merely inept, they aren&#x27;t going to try to get at the real roots of the problem, like sky high housing costs.",1430865501

In the late 1700s there was sufficient level of education to make people think critically and consider alternatives, plus a great deal of philosophical understanding.  Probably literacy reached a local maximum, or a higher level than in generations prior.<p>But one of the big challenges of success is that it&#x27;s easy to take it for granted, especially each successive generation who grows up used to the benefits that their parents worked hard to win for them (or the results of major global conflicts in some cases. But even those result in post war booms.)<p>To take this out of the broad country level perspective, where technological and other advancements and history could be argued to be the cause-- we could look at the second and third generation immigrants to the USA.  I suspect, and I hear this anecdotally, but I don&#x27;t have data-- that the first generation kids are more industrious than the third or fourth-- and that this is probably true in the 1800s, 1900s and now.<p>In fact, I would argue that it was the presumption that prosperity (Which we&#x27;ve had) would result in ever higher levels of literacy (Which we&#x27;ve experienced) and thus higher levels of enlightenment and philosophical perspective due to ever better education and schools -- which we have not had.<p>Schools have slowly declined to the point where I suspect most schools don&#x27;t even teach classical literature, let alone philosophy.<p>So, I think the lesson to learn from the USA is to never let the government take over the schools.",1430865438

There is historically a distinction between &quot;operating system&quot; and &quot;shared library shipping with the operating system&quot;.  I think I am losing this battle though.<p>2. On a number of platforms (not sure if Apple&#x27;s &quot;OS atomics&quot; concept counts here), the atomic wrappers are not even functions in a shared library.  They may be declared inline in a header file.  Or they may be compiler intrinsics, where the compiler doesn&#x27;t generate any function call in any circumstances.  Is that an &quot;OS function&quot;?  Not really.<p>In either case #1 or case #2, I think &quot;OS atomics&quot; is a dumb name.  We are really talking about CPU features, not OS features.

Instead, they just went with the flow, and didn&#x27;t intervene...

There were any number of excuses to make banks register transactions, limit ownership of firearms, control speech to stop anti-american and pro-british propaganda and the like.<p>But they didn&#x27;t.  In Britain, they saw the result of onerous regulations piled on top of each other for decades--- always with good excuses and claims of noble intentions-- and how it stifled the spirit.<p>As a result they fought, and then they went thru two forms of government in rapid succession ending up with the constitution which was only able to be passed after the Bill of Rights was added.<p>One of the arguments against tacking on the bill of rights was that by naming these rights they would be limited, and no mere 10 amendments could encompass all of mans rights.

It took a constitutional amendment, which some debate was never properly ratified, to even get them.)<p>If the USA doesn&#x27;t turn around and start embracing freedom, then more and more quickly we will slide to the despotism that caused use to leave the British in the first place.<p>Only in this age there are no colonies-- but there is cyberspace.<p>When bitcoin is illegal, only criminals will have bitcoin.

9495312,comment,9492110,9492110,0,0,wglb,,,"My journey is quite the reverse. I grew up on a dryland wheat farm in northern Montana, 60 miles from Canada, 90 miles from Glacier Park. Dryland means that there are about 12 inches of rain in a year, about what Tucson, AZ gets. Growing season is about two days shorter than what it takes to grow wheat. I did most of the tractor driving during the summer starting when I was 12, and my Dad and I had to do all the harvesting by ourselves the summer that I was 13, as the hired man quit two weeks before harvest. Harvest was 100 hour weeks.<p>In the winter, Dad went to the library each day, checked out 3 books, (the maximum then), returned them the next day, got three more. Mom would always be cooking and cleaning, getting us kids off to school, secretly writing poetry.<p>Farming for us was mostly about driving. Tractor, truck, swather, combine, rake, fuel pickup. Not so romantic as painted by the article.<p>Lots of fond memories. Sunsets would often fill the vast sky. Light in the sky until 10:45. Milky Way an astonishing sight. Occasional Aurora. On the tractor on a summer day, if you watched very carefully, you could see the dust devils form, and see the smooth-walled tube raise up a 1000 feet or more, then disappear. The satisfaction of learning how to drive a caterpillar pulling a duckfoot plow and making a half-mile long very straight line. The satisfaction of the end of harvest, which statistically would be on the day that the sky turned black and the fields were inaccessible for weeks.<p>But hard work during the summer, for sure. 10 hours each day on a tractor, no radio or other entertainment other than daydreams. (And still the only place that you can find me singing. And even then, not very often.) The risk incumbent with a state known for violent weather making sure you got all the harvest in in the approximately 30 days that you had available. Or the day in late June when I was about 8 that a sudden thunderstorm came up and the three of us watched, transfixed, as a 10 minute hailstorm wiped out the crop. Dad says &quot;Well, that&#x27;s it for this year&quot;.<p>And there are some irreconcilables. Judy Blunt in Breaking Clean said it very well about her own boys after she left the farm and moved to the university town: &quot;On the farm, they were men in training. Here, they are just boys&quot;.<p>What most folks don&#x27;t understand is that in America, the lives of small farmers, staring with my Grandfather&#x27;s generation, was more affected by technology than any other way of life. A nearly two orders of magnitude of improvement in productivity over that time span. So even the farm of my youth isn&#x27;t any more. Patterns are already different, machines are larger, more sophisticated. I am pretty sure that both Dad and Mom don&#x27;t have much romance for that way of life. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out of there to University, with the full support and encouragement of my family. Even thought there isn&#x27;t really a horizon here in Illinois. You can&#x27;t see what the weather is until it is upon you.<p>I do get back now and again, having some family there. The sunsets are spectacular. So is the wind, occasionally tipping over boxcars. And there is February.<p>But props to the author of the article. Do what you love.  But I can&#x27;t help but wonder if there isn&#x27;t a bit of a Hawthorne effect for both of us.",1430863688

9495283,comment,9492858,9494613,0,0,irishcoffee,,,"Why?<p>French and Italian [0] are considered romance languages, because among other things they sound pretty. Russian [1] (and I suppose most Slavic languages) just don&#x27;t generally sound pretty. For what its worth, I speak Russian; not terribly well, but I speak it. Russian really isn&#x27;t a language that sounds &quot;pretty&quot; or &quot;silky&quot;, or whichever adjective you&#x27;d prefer.<p>The reason I decided to respond to you comment was a little more abstract than that though. People liking or disliking things about other kinds of people isn&#x27;t racist. Some people just don&#x27;t like things. I don&#x27;t like black licorice (no idea who invented it, but I don&#x27;t like it). I don&#x27;t particularly care for traditional German food (I&#x27;ll eat it, its just not my go to for food), and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever wear a kilt to a wedding (I&#x27;m mostly Irish, then Italian, then Native American).<p>I don&#x27;t think those things make me racist or xenophobic. At least, I don&#x27;t think less of anyone who prefers any of those things. I just don&#x27;t like them for me.<p>I think if we start claiming that not liking something like a language is racist, we&#x27;re on a slippery slope indeed. For example, I don&#x27;t like the color red. I don&#x27;t like traditional Mexican music. Do either one of those things make me racist?<p>I&#x27;m not trying to attack by any means, I&#x27;m sincerely curious.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.orbilat.com/General_Survey/List_of_Romance_Languages.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.orbilat.com/General_Survey/List_of_Romance_Langua...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.russiaslam.com/2012/stories/the-russian-language-what-does-it-sounds-like.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.russiaslam.com/2012/stories/the-russian-language-...</a>",1430863376

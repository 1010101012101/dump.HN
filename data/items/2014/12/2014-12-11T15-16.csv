Sure, Github has great ideas like forking and transparency, but it also has a ton of barriers, like memorizing a bunch of terminal commands/flags or using a relatively buggy UI. You could also argue that Github reduces the weight of a (citizen) vote or a comment.

Our society has fucked-up priorities. Everything is based on the next quarter, not the next 50 years. Most of us are employed on semi-charismatic executives&#x27; private-sector political campaigns (sorry, I mean &quot;careers&quot;) rather than advancing the state of the world.<p><i>I think you&#x27;re looking at industry, while I&#x27;m looking at research (where I enjoy living).</i><p>Fair. But the low pay in research and extreme difficulty of getting in once you&#x27;re out (PhD admissions get hard after 30; returning to academia if you leave after a PhD is nearly impossible) are indicators that our society&#x27;s disinvestment in academia is continuing unabated.<p>Expanding industries take chances on people and train people up. Besieged and contracting industries (like academia) develop the pedigree bigotry and petty politicking.<p><i>Neural Turing Machines (paper published out of DeepMind), for instance, can learn a general, arbitrary function on arbitrary-size data structures from input-output examples. That is a phenomenal advance in learning: generalized induction of functions, up to complexity limits.</i><p>Yeah, there&#x27;s a lot of great work that&#x27;s being done. AI &quot;winter&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean otherwise, and nor does this mediocre spring that (one hopes) is the precursor to something better. As I said, the current state is an acceptable March but, if this is summer, that&#x27;s depressing.<p>It&#x27;s not a lack of great work being done that&#x27;s the problem. It&#x27;s the fact that there&#x27;s so little funding for it, and consequently so very few people are doing anything stimulating or important. There are always a few who can do great work in spite of the system, but we shouldn&#x27;t have to bet our society on that.<p>It wasn&#x27;t a lone hero that put people on the moon; it&#x27;s was a large set of people working together (who weren&#x27;t worrying about whether they&#x27;d be employable after 40, because they were taken care of). I don&#x27;t think you can form that kind of an all-around strong team with academia and industry both in their current, degraded, resource-starved state.<p>Right now, you need top-0.25% talent <i>and</i> to sacrifice your life to get an academic or basic-research position.

If you don&#x27;t write anything else to the page, those zeros will be written out to main memory eventually, but if you weren&#x27;t going to write anything, there was no need to allocate the page to start with.  So the most common scenario is the zeros get written to L1, which is fast, and then your real data overwrites it in L1 before it&#x27;s pushed out to lower levels of the cache or memory.  The initial write may require a read-for-ownership from memory, depending on the exact cache semantics, but if that&#x27;s required, it would be required for you to write your data anyway.",1418313241

8735400,comment,8734877,8735306,0,0,nrinaudo,,,"I believe he means that very often, type annotations are not necessary to know unambiguously the type of a variable or the return type of a function.<p>For example, in the following Java code:<p><pre><code>  public String myMethod() { return &quot;hello, world&quot;; }
  String myVal = myMethod();
</code></pre>
Given that the compiler knows that myMethod cannot return anything but a string, there really should be no need to state it explicitly - it&#x27;s redundant information. Likewise, myVal can only be of the same type as myMethod&#x27;s return type.<p>Languages with type inference get rid of (most of) that redundancy.

Calling it object oriented programming and having classes and inheritance made all of academia excited because you got to name and classify things. Object reuse was going to save the world, etc.<p>Message oriented programming - that you need some kind of message protocol between two things to communicate is something we do a lot of, and has built huge systems like The Internet and all of our web services and JSON API&#x27;s and all that jazz.<p>The beauty of MOP is that once you have a format between two things, you can simply code to the format. We do this all the time with Web API&#x27;s. The entire paradigm of microservices that is gaining popularity is really close to what Alan Kay was talking about when he created OOP. The biggest difference is microservices add network overhead complexity.<p>If we built software as a series of Objects/Services/Containers that sent messages to each other over an enforced protocol, many of the OOP complaints go away because what is important is NOT the object, it&#x27;s the communication protocol between objects that drives value.<p>We have completely inverted the paradigm and lost a lot of value along the way.<p>You don&#x27;t need a lot to do message oriented programming. You need request/response formats, you need to enforce those formats, and you need a sender and receiver that do things on either end of the request-response.<p>Erlang and the Actor pattern seems to be one approach to solving problems using this technique, microservices is another.<p>I think there is a third option where you have contained objects/services/whatever running in the same program sending simple data structures like hashes as messages back and forth to each other. It would work well as long as you have code to enforce the message protocol between things(right data format, nil checks, etc).<p>That approach could be done in OO languages like Ruby, Java, C++, PHP, Python, etc. OR it could be done in FP languages like Clojure, LISP, etc.<p>It&#x27;s not complicated, it&#x27;s just applying the request-response pattern to connect objects/processes/code together in a sane way. Sort of like UNIX pipes on the command line. Sort of like HTTP. Sort of like a lot of things we use, but don&#x27;t seem to think would be good patterns for code.",1418312072

Worse, they also show a clear difference in intelligence between different ideological groups (e.g. religion) (again, and they also show a large difference in other metrics).<p>To some extent Watson, in his first claim, has a point that we seem to be unwilling to make. There is a clear conclusion to be drawn here :<p>Different races are different. In pretty much any metric you can come up with.<p>Furthermore, if you look at the effect of average differences in a certain metric to examples in individuals, you get an even more politically incorrect result, based on pure math.

 - It&#x27;s impossible to know whether said people would have paid for the content otherwise
 - It&#x27;s impossible to know whether said people would have even known about the content were it not for illegally acquiring it<p>The following is my subjective opinion:
You are a fool if you&#x27;re angry about piracy on your pet project. You should be glad people go out and look for it. You have an audience.<p>That audience may not be entirely composed of people willing to pay for your work, but looking for such an audience is not a viable business plan. What you&#x27;re getting is free advertising. What you&#x27;re seeing on torrent sites is the very primitive equivalent of what happens on, for example, YouTube where you have channels and networks making more than they can ever dream off ads and sales just because they have the ability to <i>reach</i> so many people at such convenience.<p>Ears and eyeballs can directly translate to wallets, given the means. But instead of Hollywood/RIAA solving that problem, we have them prosecuting potential fans. We have them shutting down audiences by raiding sites that are full of actual fans. We have them corrupting judicial and political systems one after the other.

Most projects are just wood sheds and latrines and gas stations. In terms of grunt-work programming where the problem domain is well understood, OO works just fine.<p>And FP works just fine. And straight procedural works just fine. And it really doesn&#x27;t matter. Because the quality of software has nothing to do with your choice of paradigm or programming language or operating system or anything. It is the team that matters. That&#x27;s it.<p>And if you&#x27;re embarking on a massive air liner or an epic poem, your basic choices of tools are once again not going to matter that much, either. It is again up to having the right people. In this case, you need brilliant people, and not just people who struggle to put together a birdhouse without supervision.",1418311538

People used it primarily to obtain media and software without paying for it.</i> //<p>I think there is an issue of rights and freedoms.<p>With a capitalist economy certain elements of culture are effectively reserved for the wealthy. In other state structures those making the cultural artefacts that we use to express our selves, to link, to coalesce on common sentiment, those could be sufficiently supported to make all cultural artefacts free-gratis and free-libre.<p>The democratisation of media particularly through availability of music and film - which are so central to our cultural experience - means that many who would otherwise be [partially] excluded from participation in today&#x27;s culture (for better or worse) can take part.<p>Moreover, copyright was initially set up with a view to ensuring that eventually the wealth locked up in shared experience, cultural introspection, confrontation with new ideas and different aspects of the culture would be freed in to the public domain.<p>The actions of media corporations, the use of DRM, these things (amongst others I&#x27;m sure) act to prevent entry to the public domain. DRM in particular breaks the copyright deal, if we the people aren&#x27;t going to get our side of the copyright bargain why should we uphold the side that suits those financial interested in media production? Usually with a contract if one side breaks the terms then the contract is nullified - surely this morally should be true too of copyright.<p>In short, I think to assume that this is solely an issue of &#x27;people who could pay to consume media choosing not to&#x27; is wrong, that there is a greater depth to this and that the likes of TPB have made a change to the access to the culture of the age making it [more] available to those of restricted means. I think this can make for more cohesion in society. Possibly too it makes for more homogeneity, that may not be a good thing however if the principle messages being passed (and shared) in society are those coming from Hollywood.<p>I feel there&#x27;s much more to say on this.

I think that someone who wants to be a career scientist <i>should</i> go back and get a PhD-level education. That said, the opportunity cost (a million dollars at my age, and I&#x27;m only 31) is so severe that the social signal is that society doesn&#x27;t value this skill set.<p>You don&#x27;t need a graduate school experience to target ads or be a financial quant, but you should have a PhD in physics if you&#x27;re going to be doing theoretical physics for 40 years.<p>That said, if there were truly a &quot;talent shortage&quot;, people wouldn&#x27;t have to put their careers on pause for 5 years to get the degree, because employers would bend over backward to help people through the process. In the 1970s, BA-level research positions existed and there was usually an expectation that, after 2 years or so in one, you&#x27;d go back to grad school on the company&#x27;s dime (while working full-time in the summer) and they&#x27;d help you a great deal with admissions by making sure you had opportunities to publish (on the clock). You wouldn&#x27;t be making a full developer salary (in today&#x27;s terms, closer to 80k than 120k) because you&#x27;d be working part-time, but you&#x27;d be living well <i>and</i> progressing toward a degree. <i>That</i> is what you see in a talent shortage. In 2014, it&#x27;s pretty rare for an employer to pay for graduate school because, well, there isn&#x27;t a talent shortage relative to the work that employers will actually pay for. There&#x27;s a talent surplus, which is why you see PhDs filling BA-level research positions.<p><i>I like knowing there&#x27;s at least one technology community where &quot;I published three papers in NIPS/USENIX/POPL/$YOUR_FIELDS_CONFERENCE for my MSc/PhD/post-doc&quot; actually gets more appreciation than, &quot;I read an Android book and coded up something like Angry Birds, only more different.&quot;</i><p>I agree.

Cleaning data so it can be fed into an off-the-shelf SVM package isn&#x27;t very interesting. That&#x27;s a 40-degree day, to use Stringer Bell&#x27;s terminology.

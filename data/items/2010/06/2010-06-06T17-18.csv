And it's a success, they get 15 reviews up on their page. But that's also extremely biased, and if every business could do that, the site wouldn't be useful. And so what happens? Well, all those reviews get filtered. And so then they are convinced that if they had paid, those 13 reviews would have stayed up.""<p>No, they are convinced that if they had paid, the <i>already existing</i> good reviews would have stayed up.",1275847061

My transmission rate is based upon the HIV transmission rate for unprotected anal sex, which is pretty clearly an upper bound--that's why especially slutty or outgoing populations get >50% infection rates after 20 years seeding from 1% infection rate.

They cite large tuition/living costs and ""wastes of time"" as not worth the potential four year education gained. These articles and blog posts claim that jumping straight into industry is an acceptable and perhaps even favorable alternative.</i><p>I don't think this viewpoint is credible, and you shouldn't listen to it. What is true is that, for many people going into college, it's a misuse (but a required one, often) of time because they're destined for non-college jobs. Widespread higher education is a waste of society's resources, and a lot of colleges out there aren't very good. But this decision isn't about society and its resources; it's about what's best for you.<p>What's best for you is <i>probably</i> to get a college education. It's very hard to get a decent job without one (and not so easy to get one if you have one, but that's another story).<p>Read every post on this thread. The advice here is great, and a good CS education will put you miles ahead (in terms of skill) of where you'd be without one. If, for some reason, you end up at a school that doesn't have a good CS program (a ""Java school"") then major in math and take the CS courses you like, plus independent studies.<p>As for which universities and colleges are decent, there are about 200 good universities and liberal arts colleges in the US, including most state flagships. You don't have to go to an Ivy or MIT to get a good education, and the drop off from Harvard to (for example) Penn State is measurable but not that steep; the academic job market is so rough that a lot of brilliant professors are ending up at middling universities.

Of course the general improvements with so many problems means that more people are living long enough to get cancer....<p>The cost of cancer treatment is high enough that it probably swamps primary care, but one should still run the numbers.  Large populations can have results that are non-intuitive to most, e.g. the increased costs of much preventive medicine due to the large numbers that need to be constantly screened to find a few true positives.  If I didn't have a family history of aggressive prostate cancer (great-grandfather, 1 out of 6 uncles) I'd listen to my doctor's discouragement on getting yearly PSA testing (now that I'm 49, and yes, I know the test is rather iffy, how iffy I'll learn about after a baseline is established and/or before someone wants to do a biopsy (ouch)).  Then again, I'll be paying the full cost of most of those tests.<p>WRT specialists and outcomes, raw full population outcomes aren't as useful for the individual considering options.  In theory/in general the specialist will be able to go beyond the raw numbers and have a better idea of which option is the best bet.<p>I myself just can't understand the compliance problem ... although I do see the lack of appreciation of complex/the full system issues; even though I ended up going in the directions of chemistry and computers, my early medicine and biology learning was <i>really</i> beneficial.<p>I myself find the online guides to be useful (well, the <i>Merck Manual</i> is lots cheaper on-line for free :-), for me the biggest limitation in using them is not knowing what's normal.  E.g. that tongue coating under these circumstances is no problem, maybe stop taking your antibiotic a couple of days early sort of thing.  I know most people aren't in a position to get enough useful out of them to seriously ""bend the cost curve"", to draw this back to the main topic.<p>I'd never consider otitis media to be simple, it just obviously isn't, too much hidden, too much guesswork, especially since outcomes are so often ... not optimal (e.g. I lost some hearing in one ear due to one infection in the '70s, a girlfriend as well in the '80s).<p>Anyway, thanks for the intelligent discussion.",1275844806

I was pointing out that cons structures are inefficient not only in runtime but also in space, so that's a bad way to store code on machines where the limiting factor is space, not speed. It's well-established that that's a bad way to store code on machines where the limiting factor is speed.<p>Conclusion of the article: it turns out that, although a bytecode like Smalltalk's is a lot slower than machine code, it's also a <i>lot</i> more compact. This conclusion is equally applicable to implementing embedded Lisps as embedded Smalltalks.",1275844527

Even if those same students put all the money into your new group idea, there would need to be some form of central administration that manages all of the hiring, courses, etc.  Also, it's not really free to join if the students need to rent the buildings, equipment, and lecturers (and wouldn't be fair to the ones that pay if it was).",1275843802

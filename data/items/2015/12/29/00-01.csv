After all, RubyMotion and the Elements Compiler (www.elementscompiler.com) have kept up with all the new compiler requirements from Apple, including the requirement to emit bitcode for watchOS and tvOS. So clearly it&#x27;s possible. And using LLVM directly, rather than using C as an intermediate representation, yields more control over debug information.

An asthma attack can range anywhere from moderate difficulty breathing (as though you&#x27;re breathing through a straw or wet towel) to literal inability to breathe.<p>The treatment can be relatively simple, but in those cases you usually don&#x27;t go to the ED to begin with:  an in-home nebulizer device costs a few hundred dollars (uninsured) and pays for itself by saving only one ED trip (even if insured).  The exception, naturally, is if your asthma is undiagnosed or usually not problematic, or if you run out of medication and need more in a hurry.<p>If it goes beyond that, the patient will often require intravenous medication, which a typical walk-in clinic is not equipped to administer.  Even if the attack is obliging enough to occur when the clinic is open, all they will do is send you to the nearest emergency department.<p>The most severe attacks will require EMTs on-site, because the patient could easily die before reaching the hospital.  One sometimes goes to the hospital in cases where one fears it will escalate to this as a simple preemptive, because if it goes badly <i>you die</i>.<p>It&#x27;s true that there is a cost to handling all of this, and that needs to be understood.  Still, it&#x27;s worth remembering that this isn&#x27;t some frivolous waste of resources:  said resources are being applied to a legitimate need.

How do i use async/await in CLJS?<p>There&#x27;s a long discussion here, which I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;re already aware of, on the tradeoffs:<p><a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojurescript/LBy0yiZiWrA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojurescript/LBy0yi...</a><p>Each approach has its downsides, but clearly core.async and promises work just fine here.<p>>More importantly why shouldn&#x27;t i use something like ESLisp if I am into lisp but want to work with JS features directly? Why would I want to mix JS with CLJS amd require everyone who maintains my code to know both?<p>Language semantics is why. ClojureScript has much cleaner semantics than Js and languages that provide syntax sugar on top of it. It&#x27;s immutable by default, has clean and consistent syntax, and far less gotchas than Js.<p>Nobody actually mixes Js with ClojureScript. People write libraries backed by Js internally, but the users of these libraries don&#x27;t have to know or care about that.<p>The real question is why would somebody want to learn the giant clusterfuck that ES6/7 constitutes when far saner alternatives are available.<p>> i gave up on CLJS after it was evident to me that JS is maturing and has copied a lot of the stuff I like from CLJS plus some stuff from C# like async/await.<p>Adding features to an already poorly designed language does not make it better. You end up with a giant kitchen sink language that takes inordinate brainpower to work with. We&#x27;ve already seen that this is a bad idea with languages like C++ and Scala. And no, you can&#x27;t just learn a snae subset of the language, because sooner or later you have to deal with code written by other people.<p>If working with a giant quirky mess that looks like this <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/AjSTP20.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/AjSTP20.png</a> is you cup of tea then who am I to stop you, but I certainly question that it&#x27;s a rational choice. :)",1451347676

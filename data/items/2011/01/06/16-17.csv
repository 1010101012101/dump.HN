So the investor information GS is sending out says ""at some point in the future we might sell some of our Facebook holding and we won't feel obliged to tell everyone who's bought Facebook stock through us"". This is supposed to be interesting? Of <i>course</i> Goldman Sachs doesn't want to rule out the possibility that they might sell some of their Facebook stock. The possibility of selling later is, after all, one of the main reasons for buying any sort of securities.<p>You might as well look at some major company's annual report to investors, find things like ""We depend on manufacturing facilities in China for much of our production; in the event of war or a breakdown of international relations, our business might be adversely affected"", and say ""Major company says US, China may go to war"". (I don't know whether that particular concern is in any large company's annual reports, but that general kind of thing is absolutely commonplace. It's mostly a way of suggesting to investors that the company has been very diligent in looking for risks to their business.)",1294333196

Just not until we decide when that action should be taken.<p>As for forced attrition:<p>1) I would want to see a comprehensive professional development program put in place for all teachers. Teaching well is difficult, and teachers generally don't get any useful feedback from anyone (when I taught, the biggest piece of useful feedback I got from my principal was ""Make 'em afraid of you. Today, 3 kids didn't turn in their homework. If they're afraid of you, they'll do your homework"").<p>It's entirely possible that plenty of our ""bad"" teachers simply need some support and guidance and a more concrete direction.<p>2) While this is happening, a comprehensive discussion of the goals of education needs to occur. Right now, as near as I can tell, our primary purpose is American competitiveness on an international scale (how dare those children from Shanghai score better than our children?!), which will somehow translate into economic competitiveness.<p>I'm not talking national goals, at least not yet. I'm talking a comprehensive building of the things that an adult need to be able to do in order to choose and set the course of his own life to the greatest extent possible. Obviously, not everyone gets to be an astronaut, but it'd be nice if we took a few steps toward the American ideal of ""With enough gumption and hard work, anyone can be reasonably accomplished"".<p>3) Finally, I'd be okay with forced attrition if it were shown to me that the replacements would be better. Others on this board have said things like ""pay them more"", but the fact is, teaching is not a glamorous position, and is becoming less, rather than more, so as either a direct or indirect result of articles like the one posted. Additionally, most schools nation-wide are struggling with the budget (between California and Illinois, 40,000 jobs were cut last summer. Even in Omaha, where I live, the wealthiest districts are freezing their hiring if they haven't done so already).<p>You might point to programs such as Teach for America, but even they have a pretty high attrition rate, and that's only a 2-year committment (also: do you really want someone who will teach for 2 years and then go do something else?).<p>Finally, the points I outlined in my original comment still stand.<p>I'm not unilaterally opposed to forced attrition, and in fact I'm not even strongly opposed. I just want it to be conscientious, deliberate, and well-thought out, with concrete steps taken to make sure that the new crop coming in has a really good chance to do better than the old crop leaving.",1294330996

You can get 'rid' of a window by either hitting the red x (which I presume is the same as Ctrl-W),  Alt-Clicking the dock icon (which I presume is the same as Ctrl-H) or going to Menu->Quit (Ctrl-Q).<p>It's easy to understand this, once you realize that window management is app-centric and is organized by <i>Application</i> rather than individual windows but that's a subtle distinction most normal users will not understand on their own.<p>To compound things, for some apps,closing the window will actually quit the app. And for some, closing the window leaves the app still running in the dock but clicking the dock icon doesn't bring up.",1294330281

I have a cutting board ($5), a small non stick pan ($20), a medium non stick pan ($30), and a 6""-8"" diameter 4"" deep pot with a lid. I have some nonstick spray, some spices, a knife or two, a spatula, flipper thing, and tongs.<p>My total investment has to be under $100. I've been using the same stuff for 5 years now. I assume you have a toaster, a microwave, and a coffee maker already.<p>You'd be surprised the difference in your day between having a bowl of cereal to start off, and having a bowl of cereal, an english muffin, and a bannana. That doesn't take any extra time to do (toast the muffin while you eat the cereal).<p>For lunch I make myself a sandwhich and throw in some other stuff. Sure, that takes 2 minutes.<p>Dinner is the only meal you actually cook. You definitely save money cooking yourself. Compare $7 to $15 for chinese, sushi, pizza, burgers etc to $3-5 per meal. If you can cook pasta (boil water, add sauce, its the same as ramen. throw some freezer meatballs in the oven at the same time and your're done), chicken (throw a little olive oil in a pan, put it on medium, flip once in a while, cut it and make sure there is no pink left, don't over cook it) and steam vegetables (boil a little water, put the lid on top, steam it to taste) you can eat 3-4 nights a week really healthy with some variety.<p>Then fish is just a variation on cooking chicken, you just do it quicker. Your variety comes from the spices or condiments you throw on the chicken.<p>Total time is around 1/2 hour per day including cleaning up and eating.

2075785,story,,,2,4,Skywing,"Why not just create a user curated search engine?",,"I've been reading a lot of the Google-related search engine complaints. Who hasn't? They're everywhere for whatever reason. A common theme that I seem to see in most of them is that people seem to agree that some sort of user interaction is one of the few ways to eliminate spam and SEO content farm results.<p>So, why not just create a user curated search engine? Web pages would be indexed. Users would filter them, using queries. On a per-query basis, indexed pages would be subject to a reddit-esque voting system for relevance to that query. There would be no visible up voting, though. There would only be a visible down vote option. Up voting would be done automatically when a user clicks a result. Down voting would be done if a user visits a page and the page is not relevant to the query, so they come back to the search results and down vote the result (it would remove the automated up vote + 1 more to net a subtraction). Pages indexed more recently would be given priority over older pages. So what would eventually happen is the most viewed and newest pages for a query would bubble to the top, and older posts would be in the middle, and down rated posts would be at the end or maybe even excluded all together.<p>Obviously there are holes in this, such as people scamming the up-vote clicking mechanisms but I'm sure that could be prevented with more thought.<p>I think the key is that all of this voting is done on a per query basis, for relevance to that query.",1294330033

If it's the latter you're wrong, this is <i>exactly</i> what bowdlerization means. In fact I mistakenly used ""censored"" at first, than I changed the title. If you read the discussion here (and elsewhere), you'll see that the reason Alan Gribben made the change is mainly that he saw people were uncomfortable in his public readings in Alabama. His audience understood and absorbed the book alright, they just found this word objectionable.<p>However, if you take issue with my labeling this as PC, this might be debatable. On the one hand you have sensibilities, etc, on the other respect for an author's text. If you read Paul Butler's (in my opinion quite flawed) comments in the discussion, you'll see that he doesn't actually object to the usage of the work ""nigger"", he just doesn't like it when it is appropriated by people other than African-Americans.

2075772,comment,2074322,2075174,0,0,andrewce,,,"Direct instruction works great for mechanical skills, because there is a 1:1 correspondence between that which is tested and that which is assessed, and because the goals are clear and discrete. If we're talking something like multiplication by two-digit numbers, or properly using semi-colons, those skills are mechanical enough that direct-instruction will work, and will probably work at least somewhat well, assuming that it does not become a slog for the students.<p>Personally, I'm willing to put up with scripted lessons, so long as the script works the way it should most of the time and so long as I've got the ability to modify if it needs modification. There is a distinct difference between a strong script and an incredibly constrictive script.<p>I'll still argue that teaching is as much an art as it is a science, but you're right that lesson plans can be transferred between teachers. I have no compunctions about stealing good ideas and good methodology, and have had success doing so.<p>Here are some broader concepts we can appropriate, which should be palatable to most good teachers:<p>1) Have a concrete goal, and reinforce it consistently until students are able to meet it.<p>2) Group students by ability (within a class, if necessary), so that everyone is constantly moving forward.<p>3) Make sure that there is a deliberate progression, or at least as close to one as possible. Not everything has a deliberate progression (writing, for example, is a pretty non-linear process once you get past a certain ability level).<p>4) Judge classroom progress by student achievement, rather than by the calendar.<p>The one reservation I have about Direct Instruction is that it removes some the ability of a lesson to go useful places. If I am teaching a lesson on metaphors while my class reads ""The Great Gatsby"" (which has impeccable metaphors), and a student says ""Hey, when it describes Gatsby as 'dispensing starlight to casual moths', that's a metaphor, and it's parallel in theme to this poem we read two weeks ago""; this is exactly the type of thinking I want my students to be able to do, because it is the type of thinking that will be important later.<p>That said, if they do not know how to write grammatically complete sentences or how to multiply without a calculator, then I guess all the metaphors in the world can't save them.<p>(TL;DR: I generally agree in principle, but have reservations regarding practice)",1294329847

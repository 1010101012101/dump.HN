It wasn&#x27;t before my direct experience.<p>(2) I&#x27;ve confirmed with a bunch of people currently at Google that, indeed, nothing has changed. This study was done 5+ years ago.<p>(3) My books don&#x27;t focus on brainteasers. Thus, if people believe these changes at Google are real, then this would actually make my books seem more relevant, not less.<p>(4) If brainteasers are banned, this doesn&#x27;t mean that no one has even asked them. Some people break the rules (because they&#x27;re unaware of them or because they don&#x27;t feel that a particular question is a brainteaser). Thus, Google could, theoretically, study how effective brainteasers are even while they are banned.<p>(5) What Laszlo is saying is provably incorrect. He&#x27;s saying estimation questions are brainteasers and that they no longer ask such questions. This is false. If he wants to define these questions as brainteasers, he&#x27;s welcome to do that. However, he would then be wrong about Google continuing to ask brainteasers. By his definition, Google absolutely does ask these &quot;brainteasers&quot; frequently.<p>(6) What I really suspect is going on is that he misremembered the study (a reasonable thing to conclude, given #5). It was, after all, done 5+ years ago. I don&#x27;t think the study ever actually looked at brainteasers. I read the results, and I don&#x27;t remember anything about brainteasers. (They <i>did</i> look at interview scores and job review scores though.)<p>(7) Huh? It&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; a means to promote my books? That&#x27;s a huge leap. My books aren&#x27;t even mentioned anywhere except for in my bio. You could argue that it indirectly promotes my books, but then basically everyone ever writing anything is promoting their stuff. And, even so, you couldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s <i>just</i> to promote their stuff.  This article is a means to counter a lot of the myths around Google hiring practices. I don&#x27;t like candidates walking into interviews misinformed.",1371851989

5921272,comment,5920034,5921120,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"What you say is technically true, but those procedures also exist because it&#x27;s better, from the company&#x27;s perspective, to have such demonstration in place than to have to prove, in court, that it did nothing wrong. Companies don&#x27;t want HR data of any kind (even if it will prove the firm&#x27;s case) seeing fresh air.<p>For one example that can be played (by employee) to a win, the most common case of a good person being fired seems to be one in which he&#x27;s seeking transfer to another team, and the manager decides to punish the &quot;disloyal&quot; report, often with negative reviews and &quot;performance improvement plans&quot; that block transfer outright. In that particular case, it&#x27;s arguably retaliation (over a legitimate use of internal mobility procedures) and harassment (negative communication interfering with job performance) for the manager to be doing so.<p>Technically, if a manager interferes with a report&#x27;s ability to transfer, that <i>is</i> harassment, and bad performance reviews qualify in companies that use Enron-style reviews (i.e. reviews that are part of the transfer packet). That&#x27;s why Google has secret calibration scores: it&#x27;s a CYA move. Managers can give positive verbal feedback and annotate it with a smear that the employee never sees. This makes it less likely that a report&#x27;s lack of mobility will result in a lawsuit.<p>That&#x27;s why if you <i>ever</i> see a PIP, you should <i>never</i> sign it, and in fact leave the room immediately. &quot;I have to go to the bathroom&quot;. Then you start your internal mobility search immediately. If you do it properly (this includes that you were never there to see the PIP) then the pursuit of transfer happened <i>before</i> the PIP, which hints at a retaliatory context.<p>This move doesn&#x27;t work under a probationary period because anyone who seeks transfer when on probation is (reasonable man standard) deemed unwilling to follow workplace policies-- or, more informally but to the point, a flake.",1371851894
5921271,comment,5920144,5921226,6,0,alexqgb,,,"Again, no. And as your own links demonstrate, this is not simply what I personally believe. It&#x27;s also what the ACLU believes. Seriously, did you even read what you posted?<p>For instance, the one about medical records is discussing warrants, and whether the government needs one IN ADDITION to clear and articulable suspicion pertaining to a crime, and not just suspicion. Even in cases where the constraints on searches are eased, the reasonable expectation that privacy exists remains very real. Indeed, if there weren&#x27;t a reasonable expectation of privacy, there wouldn&#x27;t need to be clear rules describing how and when it can be pierced.<p>The article goes on to discuss the additional exemptions to the need for warrants pertaining to national security concerns, but as it points out, the existence of these provisions in law IS NOT to be interpreted as a validation of their constitutionality. In fact, the whole point of the link you provided is to underscore how dubious the claims to constitutionality really are.<p>Here&#x27;s the crux of it:<p>Q: Is it Constitutional for the government to get my medical information without a warrant?<p>A: The ACLU believes that this easy, warrantless access to our medical information violates the U.S. Constitution, especially the Fourth Amendment, which generally bars the government from engaging in unreasonable searches and seizures.[viii] However, because the Patriot Act and the HIPAA regulations have only recently gone into effect, their constitutionality remains largely untested, although at least one legal challenge to the HIPAA rules is underway, and more challenges are likely.",1371851879

This makes sense because it is entirely possible for an Erlang application that was upgraded without ever being shut down to want to roll back to older versions.<p>When this happens, this application has a path with all the libraries and dependencies it ever needed and can rollback to an older one (without shutting down), or start fresh from the newest one automatically.<p>Other metadata may be added by each release as required.<p>The thing is that Erlang developers who are experienced and will write and ship products and Erlang will know this and try to build releases and packages that respect this.

I would make the case for that reason rather than as a malware resistance measure.<p>The long term fix requires architectural changes: none of the attacks described work directly on Mac OS X because the Keychain decoding happens in the securityd process which runs as root so the malware would trigger a confirmation prompt for each password it tried to pilfer. Unfortunately, this is also less than perfect as most users check the Always allow box granting permission to their browser for unprompted access",1371850608
5921172,comment,5920312,5920959,14,0,dnautics,,,"We use CLC.<p>Basically the workflow is 1) find sequences that you want to stitch together.  2) build a draft plasmid. 3) make fine tuning changes (making sure RBSes are ok, we aren&#x27;t stomping on terminators or promoters, etc, add mutations if we want).  4) annotate primer regions. 5) cut and paste into IDT&#x27;s primer orderer.<p>The bulk of my gibson assemblies (about 50 of the ~100 that I&#x27;ve done personally, plus 12 that my college intern last year did, and 13 going on 48+ that my intern this summer is doing) are for site-directed mutagenesis; quikchange blows, and the plasmid I&#x27;m playing with is 20kb anyways, with 12kb of mission critical DNA.  The general scheme is: design 2 mutagenic primers, 2 PCR using primers that flank a pair of unique restriction sites near our site, then gibson the left hand and right hand products with a stock of pre-digested plasmid.  Since bacterial plasmid propagation is &quot;error-free&quot;, we don&#x27;t bother sequencing all but 1kb or so of the final product - saves on cost - and our plan is to do shotgun sequencing of all of the plasmids, barcoded, with ionTorrent when we&#x27;re done.<p>We&#x27;re also doing combinatorial installation of promoters that my boss&#x27; intern has done (27 constructs) - that I&#x27;ve partially supervised.  Among the other things that I&#x27;ve done are gene fusions, leader sequence deletions, moving around restriction sites, swapping plasmid backbones, assembly of complex, highly repetitive sequences, and we attempted (but only partially succeeded at) capturing a eukaryotic chromosome by the telomeres.<p>We cut a lot of corners, but for NEB&#x27;s sake (I like them) I&#x27;m not going to discuss exactly what those corners are, quite yet.  Even with ours sloppiness, it works nearly every time, often with 8/8 correct (and sometimes you have to screen 48 to get one, but that&#x27;s rare and I haven&#x27;t had that happen in about a year or so).  My general philosophy is the more sloppy you can get away with being, the more robust your procedure is - I like gibson assembly because I can teach it to an undergrad in a week and have them rip roaring on a project.<p>There are lesser known properties of gibson assembly (and this is in the original paper if you read it carefully, which most people don&#x27;t) - you can have inexact ends, for example, if you want to have a template that is released using restriction enzymes - the 3&#x27; exonuclease activity of the polymerase will remove it and create a seamless construct with no evidence of the former restriction site.  I have to warn:  This would be hard (but not impossible) to implement in a design suite, and nearly impossible for automated design unless you are using exactly the same RE protocol each time.<p>Slight disclaimer - I&#x27;m a coworker of Dan Gibson&#x27;s, so take my evangelism with a little bit of a grain of salt.  I will also say, that there are plasmids that you absolutely can&#x27;t gibson clone into and <i>we don&#x27;t know why</i>.  pBR322 tet marker is an unclonable position, for example.<p>Finally:, we don&#x27;t really use computational biologists.

This would also allow intermediaries (like GT) to arbitrage. For example, I&#x27;m damn sure there&#x27;s someone out there who&#x27;d pay $750 per hour for my time (or, at least, could justify that much value) but I can&#x27;t find that person-- and he probably only needs a few hours of my time, here and there. I&#x27;d be happy to sell a call option (strike $100/h) for $150/hour and let the option holder take most of the profit ($500) in order to have him doing my marketing and finding those $750/h high-value clients (which I can&#x27;t).<p>The one way my consulting call options would differ is that the option holder only gets 95% of the profit; 5% goes back to the consultant. That&#x27;s to make sure the consultant knows the actual price he or she is billed at.<p>Employment is already a call option, really. Take software engineers. The median of us is worth less than our salary, but the good ones are worth 5x and the great ones are 20-100x. That&#x27;s hard to predict, because it&#x27;s not only a factor of the individual, but also project/person fit and being assigned to high-yield work. Many software engineers at large companies could be rendering over $1 million per year in value, but are being held on evaluative Fourth Quadrant Work ( <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/fourth-quadrant-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/fourth-quadra...</a> ) while management decides whether or not to trust them with a real project. So there&#x27;s already a call-option dynamic in place; it&#x27;s just that right now, it works entirely out of employee favor. I want to fix that.",1371850502

The potential for corruption and abuse there is astounding, and no organisation or person should have anything like this amount of power over our lives. Politicians can be bribed, judges turned, legal cases undermined, corporate financials exposed, and leaders overthrown, all at the whim of any one of the millions of people with access to these databases, which apparently also have appallingly lax access controls and standards of oversight, along with their terrible standards for defining which signals they should intercept.<p>If complete surveillance of the population is the purpose of the GCHQ, it should be shut down in my opinion, but I think that&#x27;s a perversion of the role of signals intelligence in our society. The purpose of these agencies should be (and originally was) to defend the communications of our government from interception, to intercept communications from known enemies of the nation and to assist law enforcement and the judiciary in intercepting the communications of criminals, using all the standards of reasonable suspicion, judicial oversight etc that we hold so dearly to in collecting evidence in every other domain. Just because it&#x27;s easier and more practical for them to intercept everything and record it for later use, doesn&#x27;t make that extreme violation of many of our codes of privacy and law acceptable, predictable or desirable. It has enormous implications for our society, this is an essential debate when so much of our lives are now held in digital form, and <i>I&#x27;m surprised</i> that you try to blow it off as old news and of little consequence.",1371850050

(Both of these, I&#x27;d argue, are reasonable.) It doesn&#x27;t allow companies to vary their performance standards for different individuals, or to fire &quot;for any reason&quot;. For example, if you work for a 5,000-person company and you&#x27;re fired for performance after failing on one project and being denied transfer, and you can prove that someone else was allowed transfer under the same circumstances, you can possibly win a discrimination or harassment case (especially because any negative communication about you by management that impedes your chance at transfer can be construed as harassment; this is why the common practice of making performance reviews Enron-style-- that is, part of the transfer packet-- exposes a company to severe legal risk).<p>If you apply to a 5-person company and get fired in Month 3 because your boss (probably the CEO) isn&#x27;t feeling it, you probably don&#x27;t have legal recourse, because as owner and manager of the business, he has the right to select personnel. If it&#x27;s a 5,000-person company, and you weren&#x27;t give a few chances to prove yourself on multiple projects, you can raise accusations of personal bias. (That&#x27;s why companies implement those horrible 18-month policies against internal transfer-- it&#x27;s to create the impression of a uniform performance standard-- however, those only have legal weight if enforced uniformly, which they never are.) Even if you don&#x27;t win, you can bring a lot of HR records into fresh air (which a company doesn&#x27;t want) as they try to prove that you failed according to a set of rules that is enforced uniformly. Companies would rather pay severance than have the courts getting into their HR records.<p>The probation period is generally more &quot;at-will&quot; than regular employment. For most companies, probation means a couple of things. First, it means that a no-show constitutes voluntary resignation and therefore can&#x27;t require the company to pay unemployment. (This isn&#x27;t an issue at our level, but most people are not as ambitious and diligent as we are, and no-shows happen.) Second, it blocks the &quot;employee should have been allowed transfer before termination&quot; argument because the going assumption is that no one transfers in a probation period. Third, it often means no vacation is accrued, which is relevant when people are terminated early on (because they usually haven&#x27;t used it). Fourth, and perhaps most relevant, it means that one should not expect severance if terminated in that time.",1371849418

So let&#x27;s stipulate I&#x27;m a hiring for a standard dev role. I think you make some great points.<p>(1) Yes, ambiguity is death. It&#x27;s bad for the reason you say it is (it psyches you out, and discovering how people perform when they&#x27;re at their most psyched-out is a pointless exercise). But it&#x27;s also bad because open-ended tests are hard to grade and compare. Work-sample tests need to be standardized and they need to be defined rigorously enough that you can draw comparisons between candidates, and then draw comparisons between the performance of hires and the tests.<p>(2) Yes, grading superficial issues is also bad, for the same reason: when you give someone &quot;points for style&quot; (or demerits), you lose the ability to make apples-apples comparisons with candidates over time.<p>(3) I flat out disagree that take-home work is disrespectful of candidates. Most interview processes demand that employees submit to several (3+) hour+ long phone screens, then show up at an office for 1-2 days of interviewing. Allowing candidates to do the most important technical portion of the interview on their own time, on their own schedule, in their own location is simply better for the candidate than forcing them into a room with a whiteboard.<p>(4) Yes, not giving feedback to candidates is one of the great sins of tech hiring. Some of this is folkloric; for instance, there&#x27;s a belief that providing feedback to candidates you opt not to hire sets you up for frivolous complaints down the road. But there are ways around that problem.",1371848949

I know that probably is the idea behind these - to see what someone comes up with - but it can be very intimidating.  Especially given the fact that the interviewee is already nervous enough and now they are given something ambiguous.  I think that&#x27;s more nerve-wracking than the interview itself.<p>Second, I think that code-style tends to get graded on these more than the content.  Unless it&#x27;s completed in some really novel way (which isn&#x27;t always a positive) there&#x27;s nothing to do but nit-pick how the code looks.<p>Third, its disrespectful of the interviewees time, especially relatively large coding assignments.  If a candidate has a job, is it fair to expect them to go home and spend a couple hours working on something that is essentially worthless?<p>Finally, typically the candidate gets no feedback.  I had one that was a &#x27;pass&#x27; and I never found out why.  You are essentially grading me on an assignment and then don&#x27;t have the decency to tell me what was wrong?

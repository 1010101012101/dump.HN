Often, it&#x27;s due to Rust being a systems language and exposing low-level details to you, combined with the type system ensuring safety. In this instance, `Path` is actually fairly complex. From the RFC: <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0474-path-reform.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0474-path...</a><p><pre><code>        > The design of a path abstraction is surprisingly hard.

So, in this case, you have to call `file_name` to get the filename, but that returns an `Option`, since it might not be a file, it could be a directory. The `unwrap` says &quot;crash if it&#x27;s not a filename.&quot; You then have an `OsStr`, which is a string type that handles the kinds of cross-platform issues alluded to in the above paragraph. `to_str` will then attempt to turn it into a `&str`, but because `&str` must be unicode, if the conversion fails, it _also_ returns an Option, which is the last unwrap.<p>In systems programming, details matter. As such, our stdlib APIs try to expose those details. I expect some people will write higher-level abstractions that hide all this if you don&#x27;t care as much.<p>Tradeoffs tradeoffs tradeoffs...",1428083895

9317322,comment,9316022,9317118,0,0,cbsmith,,,"> It worries me when even people on HN are talking about banning &#x27;harmful&#x27; algorithms.<p>Why? Algorithms can be harmful as much as anything else.<p>>  The people whose algorithms ran up the stock and lost a bunch of money over a joke will learn their lesson, or will go out of business, soon enough.<p>The problem is that won&#x27;t happen. The advantage of trading stupider, but slightly faster, than the other guy is too huge. Sure, sometimes you lose money, but most of the time you make money. It&#x27;s classic game theory: the stupider but faster algorithm benefits from the slower but smarter algorithms... unfortunately though, it damages the ecosystem, and if it is allowed to continue it might actually grow to kill the ecosystem. While in theory, it is improving the liquidity of the system, the way the game is rigged, the rewards for the improved liquidity far outweigh the benefits.<p>> The SEC shouldn&#x27;t get involved.<p>I&#x27;d argue quite the contrary. Now, the SEC shouldn&#x27;t be saying, &quot;you can use this algorithm&quot; and &quot;you can&#x27;t use that algorithm&quot;, but I think there is a case to be made for imposing trading rules that don&#x27;t reward a 5% speed improvement over 100ns equally to a 5% speed improvement over 100s.",1428083729

And yes, I have felt the same disrespect for me that the author has felt.<p>But the author completely missed the point of silly word problems in math homework. They aren&#x27;t silly because educators are disconnected with the real world, and they aren&#x27;t disrespecting you either. They are silly precisely to convey the point that the words <i>do not matter</i>...much in the same way that the name of an algebraic variable does not matter.<p>The Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem, the Chinese Postman problem, and the Traveling Salesman problem are all silly word problems with a seeming disconnect from reality. And yet huge and seemingly insurmountable problems can be solved using them by employing a technique that is often called Projection: You take a problem you know but can&#x27;t solve and project it onto a similar problem you know and <i>can</i> solve.<p>Using this technique, not only could you take an NP-Complete production scheduling problem and project it into a basic integer linear program that can be solved trivially using the simplex algorithm with cutting planes and column generation...but you could also develop the simplex algorithm itself, just as Dantzig did.<p>Math teachers that formulate their homework problems in terms that are immediately applicable to the real world may be more successful in getting people interested in mathematics, but if they reduce their homework problems to just those that are &quot;real world&quot; enough to be interesting to wandering minds, they risk destroying the creativity to solve real world problems that are <i>actually hard</i>.

More to the point, I think it is in their best financial interest to do so.<p>There is a lot of doubt around the contribution of display, and video as well.  By helping arm advertisers with more data/tools to help them understand the impact of the efforts (and optimize against that), they further prove the value of their channel.  This would likely help grow revenue as the value becomes better understood.  Depending on what that value ends up being, it may even grow margins if they can command higher CPMs as a result.<p>I&#x27;ve seen you post before, so I know you have a solid understanding of the limitations of the data currently available.  I want to be clear that I&#x27;m not asking them for a silver bullet.  There will always be a need to analyze performance, view the data through the lenses of different models, and apply your own judgement.<p>But there is most certainly some low hanging fruit that would be a step in the right direction.  Let&#x27;s take the AdWords platform (not using any bid management platform) for example.  Off the top of my head some improvements Google could make there would be:<p>- Making view-through revenue data available within the UI.  If I have a conversion tag placed and am passing in revenue, Google has this data.  Why they can&#x27;t display it when they can display VTs is still a mystery to me.<p>- Search Funnel reports are a nice start with their attribution and path analysis tools.  However the fact that they don&#x27;t have display campaigns in these reports is a real limited. I know you can now get a lot of that in GA, but many advertisers don&#x27;t have that setup properly, and doing anything at scale in GA these days is a PITA with their reduced sampling threshold.<p>- Google has the path data, yet for some reason it is still not exposed in the main UI outside of &quot;assisted&quot; metrics. Good luck digging into that data at granular levels as well if you have multiple conversion goals.  Custom columns are a start, but they don&#x27;t go down to the keyword/ad level yet and are still quite limited.<p>- Google pushes video ads hard, yet the Video Advertising product is for all intents and purposes a separate product.  Sure it shares a similar design, but most of your data is siloed from AdWords (with the exception of audience lists).<p>I could go on, but these highlight some areas where they could do more to prove the value of their offering.  When you throw the capabilities of a platform like Adometry into the mix, I&#x27;ll bet they could throw a LOT more meaningful data at advertisers.  Why shouldn&#x27;t I, as a customer spending large sums of money with them every month, expect access to these capabilities to get the most out of their product?<p>I realize your point was that they can provide some data, but decisions still fall on me.  That is valid, but there&#x27;s still a lot more they could do to help inform those decisions with what they have available.",1428083112

The obvious solution: stop explaining how things work, &#x27;cause this is just making more work for ourselves.

But when you get into a business role, you have to focus on what makes something work, rather than what&#x27;s new, what&#x27;s interesting, or what you don&#x27;t already know. Now is the time to keep doing that sort of thing, and figure out what you <i>really</i> like about programming.<p>P.S. Looking at you and your friend&#x27;s sites and blogs, you are the kind of devs companies will be trying to hire. :) When I was young I spent a lot of my time &quot;looking up&quot; to a lot of devs with jobs. Having a job isn&#x27;t the end-all-be-all to being a dev. It&#x27;s not even close. There is so much to learn, and so much to do, that nobody will ever be a &quot;better&quot; dev than another. Just stronger knowledge in certain areas. :)<p>P.P.S. I focused too much on web dev when I was young. You can learn a lot about languages, and it&#x27;s awesome because you get immediate results. But frameworks like Rails provide a lot of abstractions, and if you want to learn the core concepts behind computer science, using them isn&#x27;t the best way to learn. Try writing your own framework, try writing a game (command-line if graphics is too daunting). You&#x27;ll learn algorithms, data structures, and paradigms. That&#x27;s the type of thing that translates between languages. :)",1428082110

9317113,comment,9316516,9316516,0,0,throwawayforage,,,"I&#x27;m 16, and I was in your position as well, also at age 13. I think I might be able to give you some perspective.<p>At 12, I started working on an open-source Ruby gem in a not-so-niche market (would rather not say, might give it away). I (American) had an offer from overseas (Britain) to work on a very small project in Ruby using the gem I created. I got paid about $200 I think, over PayPal. That made me want to start working.<p>Someone reached out to me right after my 13th birthday, saying they wanted to hire me to work on a Rails application, and their idea seemed good. I got nervous when the guy (whose LinkedIn seemed legit) sent over an NDA, but I figured, how much trouble can a 13-year-old really get in? I didn&#x27;t even tell my parents. I was basically getting paid to work on my gem, which I would have been doing already - no big deal. After about 2 months, I think the guy caught on to my age or lack of experience, because he told me I had finished what needed to be finished. All in all, I made $3500 for about 60 hours of work.<p>I continued working on my gem for free after that, and other companies reached out for internships, etc. I turned all but one down, because school had started in the fall, and that turned out to be only two months or so of an unpaid internship. I dabbled in other side projects after that - I was bored of working on the same project for what was now a little over a year.<p>Imagine my surprise when I come back just 6 months after that, and there are two forks of my gem on GitHub and it&#x27;s been downloaded 30,000+ times (not even counting the other two forks). And yet, the work offers had dried up. I didn&#x27;t have a website, no recruiters had my contact information, and I was a little lost on what to do. I volunteered that summer, telling myself that more opportunities would arise.<p>I haven&#x27;t worked on that project in months. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m burnt out from programming (haven&#x27;t done much of that recently either), but I&#x27;m definitely burnt out from that project. I logged onto RubyGems recently and between the original gem and all the forks of it, it&#x27;s been downloaded 100k+ times. If I created a blog, and started updating the original gem again, I&#x27;m sure I could find some work. But I&#x27;m not interested in doing that, and I&#x27;m not sure why.<p>I&#x27;m headed off to college in the fall internationally, with less work experience than I would&#x27;ve liked and less money in my pocket, too. I&#x27;m not sure what the lesson from my story is, but hopefully it will make you take the &quot;too fast, too soon&quot; ideas to heart. Don&#x27;t stop coding - if it&#x27;s what you love. But don&#x27;t let high school pass you by either (just read that you&#x27;re actually in middle school). My best memories aren&#x27;t receiving my checks in the mail or making a résumé or even coding, but the time I spent with my friends.<p>To answer your question directly, no - I was never successful in finding advertised internships for young people. It was discouraging. I&#x27;m probably lucky that guy who paid me for months didn&#x27;t confront me about my age - I&#x27;m not sure what would&#x27;ve happened.",1428081527

For example Destiny on PS4 has a minimum input latency of 100ms ( <a href=""http://www.displaylag.com/destiny-lag-factor-review/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.displaylag.com/destiny-lag-factor-review/</a> )<p>Point is, consistent input latency is much less noticeable than people seem to think.

And then if you&#x27;re not compatible with Makefiles seen in the wild you&#x27;ve effectively written an incompatible faster subset of Make, which brings us back to what Ninja is.  (In case it&#x27;s not clear, in Chrome&#x27;s case the same code was used generate Makefiles and Ninja files with some relatively minor output differences -- the tools are that close.)<p>Perhaps there&#x27;s some &quot;common&quot; subset of Make that covers some high percentage of build files seen in the wild that could be made faster.  That could be valuable to organizations who want faster builds without changing anything.  I vaguely recall seeing some commercial software that did this even -- as I recall, their value add was that they had tooling that would figure out how to run your Makefiles in parallel; though Make supports parallel execution, apparently this business found enough customers by just targeting those with underspecified Makefiles that weren&#x27;t parallel safe and then fixing them!<p>Anyway, all of this is kinda moot because for 99% of projects Make is plenty fast.  I even use Make myself for all my personal projects!  In Chrome&#x27;s case (what we wrote Ninja for) there&#x27;s so much code that the build files themselves are over ten megabytes of text, so to parse that quickly you&#x27;re at the level of worrying about avoiding memory allocations in the lexer, which is beyond what most people would care about.",1428080540

In all, it&#x27;s been super reliable (touch wood), but more than that, it has always worked. Instantly. Never needing reboots. Never crashing, never doing something wonky or glitchy that i didn&#x27;t intend. I <i>really, really</i> value that, and i hope that the everything-must-be-an-general-purpose-computer craze will pass over my cherished DSLR.<p>The same people who are proponents of smartphones can pry my &quot;dumb&quot; camera from my cold, dead fingers.<p>Long live simplicity.<p>EDIT: Something else it cannot do: update software (well, i can&#x27;t anyway). I think this type of device would be much better served by writing some good firmware and using modern full-stack proof/guarantee/checking so that the software can be certified to be correct and bug-free, then put on the device, never to be changed again. <i>That</i> is something that would make me truly happy. In 2015, we should have aeroplane-grade stability in software for devices like cameras (and phones, mind you, but that opinion is less popular).",1428080515

When I was 13, a doctor (and close friend of the family) hired me to organize sign-in documents for new patients at his office. While there was no mention of software at the beginning, you better bet that by the end of the summer, I had finished a tool that let patients sign in electronically and invalidated the need for my initial job.<p>Just don&#x27;t be dismissive of initially non-software opportunities, especially because those are the types of opportunities you&#x27;re most likely going to see from family friends (the only people who might be able to hire you at this age).",1428080420

The camera is doing the same thing his eyes and memory does, only faster.<p>The problem is not so much the data collection, it&#x27;s the retention. Because computers never forget, the police are then given a power the existing limits on their authority did not consider. So new laws need to be drafted to limit the actions of a police force that has infinite memory.<p>Which many states are doing now.

You have a small amount (16 on amd64) of &#x27;variables&#x27; called registers that you can directly work with. Additional variables have to be loaded from and stored in memory, which is slower and requires you to know that variables address (pointer) -- which is just an integer with special meaning.  In C, variables you never take a pointer to might live exclusively in a register, and all local variables are stored at a fixed offset to a special &#x27;stack pointer&#x27; which is kept in a dedicated register.<p>Some architectures try to have a more sophisticated approach  and have some sort of &#x27;fat pointer&#x27; in which pointer values have a special tag and are subject to special rules so they can only point to valid objects. The exact rules used and what constitutes &#x27;valid&#x27; is specific to the architecture. Intel has introduced mpx on newer processors to check array bounds with such a scheme, and older processors such as LISP machines have much stronger (but less efficient) schemes.",1433115244

My company gives me industry data for all the positions I manage that can be segmented by location and years of experience. We use it to guide comp changes and it makes it easy for me to know whether someone is bluffing, even when they&#x27;re talking about moving to a different city. So if one of my directs comes to me with industry averages, I can normally tell immediately that it&#x27;s just what recruiters have been quoting him/her and they&#x27;re just saying that to entice him/her to interview and get negotiated down.<p>What is useful is another offer. If one of them came to me with, &quot;I&#x27;ve got an offer at $X and would prefer not to have to switch jobs...can you match it?&quot;, I have to take that seriously.

Regards,</i><p>After that email is sent, you&#x27;ll then know if the managers will woo you with a salary increase to keep you, or laugh and tell you not to let the door hit your ass on the way out.<p>If you&#x27;re a superstar, you can leave and make more money.  The superstar programmers at DEC left and jumped shipped to Google Inc.  The superstar engineers at Lockheed & Boeing got lucrative offers from SpaceX.  You&#x27;ll also get bigger raises than a measly 5% raise.  More like 20% to 100%<p>Now, if you&#x27;re not at all interested in actually switching jobs, your options for leverage are severely handicapped.  Even in that case, I recommend a different approach than the author&#x27;s suggested text:<p>If you can&#x27;t leave the job, you have to <i>explain</i> your <i>value</i> in concrete terms and why it&#x27;s not being properly compensated.<p>Option 1:  An example of leveling up the salary to your <i>actual duties</i> that management has overlooked:   <i>&quot;Since the end 2014, I&#x27;ve been tasked to manage the Linux server reliability team in addition to delivering new web apps functionality...&quot;</i>  You then ask to talk about market rate compensation for <i>management work</i>.<p>Option 2:  An example of leveling up to <i>new tasks</i> and asking for the increased compensation to go with it:  &quot;<i>I&#x27;ve been doing web app here for 2 years but I&#x27;ve noticed many inefficiencies with the Linux reliability team.  I feel I&#x27;m the right person to take additional responsibility and make the team effective but I&#x27;d like to talk about compensation...</i>&quot;   -- Basically you&#x27;re being proactive about fast-tracking a promotion to a <i>more valuable</i> role within the company.<p>The 3rd option outlined by the author is the worst situation to be in:  Doing what exactly you&#x27;ve been doing while simultaneously asking for a ~5% raise to &quot;match market surveys&quot; is a position of weakness.  The boss responds, <i>&quot;ok, thanks for bringing your concerns to our attention, we&#x27;ll get back to you&quot;</i> ... and then they don&#x27;t bother giving you a raise.  You&#x27;ll be secretly branded as a fool if you don&#x27;t resign.<p>Lastly, some stylistic choices on author&#x27;s wordcrafting I disagree with:<p><i>&quot;I have no desire to work anywhere else, but lately I have been getting lots of recruiters and people I know at other companies reaching out to me to see if I&#x27;d be interested in making a move. I tell them I am not interested of course, &quot;</i><p>This text is an example of &quot;trying too hard&quot;.  You don&#x27;t need to write any of that &quot;social proof&quot; stuff at all.  If your managers are intelligent, they will <i>infer</i> this without you explicitly mentioning it.

9635979,comment,9634979,9635905,0,0,jessaustin,,,"Innovation is part of it, but in the Subway example you see another phenomenon, which one could call &quot;profit-taking&quot; in analogy to the financial-media cliche. That is, a decade ago when Subway was in growth mode, they didn&#x27;t want anything to prevent new franchisees from signing up. They kept their fees and ingredient prices low, and the low prices were passed on to the customer. The parent company probably didn&#x27;t worry about profit during that time. Now they feel like they have enough franchises, and it&#x27;s time to make some money. When prices are raised, the parent company makes more money, even though the franchisees probably make less, because they get a similar percentage on lower volume. Franchisees make up for that by getting really cheap, especially on labor. Because people are creatures of habit, there are still customers, even now that the same crappy sandwich that used to be $3.50 is now twice that.<p>Eventually Subway will be like Arby&#x27;s (maybe KFC is like this now as well): such a bad deal for so long that no one goes there anymore. Perhaps like McD&#x27;s, Taco Bell, etc. have in the past they&#x27;ll be able to get investors interested in supporting a cycle of lower costs.",1433114149

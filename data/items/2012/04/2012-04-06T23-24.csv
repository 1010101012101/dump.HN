Knowing where to find ramps and elevators is great for mobility and for safety, but I think that for a blind person the possibilities are even greater. Being able to navigate a building independently using an application on one's phone, for instance. Maybe Google's indoor maps won't be the end-all solution, but will hopefully get institutions thinking about the possibilities.",1333756784

It costs us all money when people get lost in hospitals. While environmental signage helps, it's often not sufficient. Visitors end up interrupting doctors and nurses to ask for directions. This directly costs the hospital money (leads to higher personnel costs), and leads to a poor customer experience (affects the recovery process for patients and families).

People who brand hotels.  Two or even three of these may be a single party.

Sometimes the <i>owner</i> will defer to the management team (which may, remember, be a separate entity).<p>Yes, WiFi (with Internet access) is the single-most requested amenity.

It has quite a large community, though not as big as Django or rails. 3700+ members of the group on groups.google.com. Massimo (the guy who invented it, and teaches it) responds to a lot of the requests for support, and normally his answers are one-liners to solve whatever problem you are having (which 99% of the time are all documented features). I've been experimenting with it for a few weeks, and I'm finding myself able to answer most people's questions about it. The whole philosophy behind it is to have sane defaults, and default to being secure.<p>As far as freelancing is concerned, it will help to know Rails if you are planning on fixing rails apps or adding features, but if you are going to be building things from scratch, I'd say choose whatever framework you know best.<p>I like Web2py because it doesn't force me to make classes for my database items, database items are simply datasets. Also, I write my code once and it works on pretty much any database backend (including GAE) without changes.<p>People criticize it because it does things differently than every other framework, but I like that it does things differently - it makes coding a web-app pretty effortless.<p>So, if you are interested in Web2Py, use it.

(2011a) asked participants to roll a die under a paper cup with a small hole at the top allowing only them to see the outcome, and earn money according to what they reported rolling (1=$1, 2=$2, etc.). As participants rolls were truly private, the authors assessed lying by comparing the reported distribution to the distribution predicted by chance (Fischbacher & Heusi, 2008). Participants were asked to roll three times but to report only the outcome of the first roll. Although all three rolls were private, the distribution of reported outcomes resembled the distribution of choosing the highest of the three observed rolls. Modifying the task to allow participants to roll only once reduced lying. Participants clearly found value in being able to justify their lies to themselves. The authors concluded that observing desired counterfactuals, in 
the form of desired (higher) values appearing on the second or third (non-relevant for pay) rolls, modified participants ethical perceptions of what they considered to be lying. Observing desired counterfactual information enabled participants to enjoy both worlds: lie for money, but feel honest.""<p>Shalvi et. al. (2011a) is:

I'd love to hear your feedback on the very popular discussion from a few days ago here (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3804134"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3804134</a>) on Raganwald's blog, ""I don't hire unlucky people"" (<a href=""http://raganwald.posterous.com/i-dont-hire-unlucky-people"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raganwald.posterous.com/i-dont-hire-unlucky-people</a>) .
Specifically, I'm curious as to how much you as the creator of this service think making a resume standout really helps an applicant compared to a bland resume from a measurably more qualified candidate?  Thanks!<p>A snippet from the blog...
---
First, I stopped caring so much about little things like how 'professionally' a resume was formatted or whether the cover email had spelling mistakes. I realized that throwing people away because of a spelling mistakes was really another way of discarding half the resums because you dont want to work with unlucky people.<p>Wait, said Oscar, but surely all things being equal, the person who takes the time to get the email right is better than the person who doesnt?<p>Sure, agreed Ernestine, But all other things arent equal. What if the email with the spelling mistake came from someone whos really busy because theyre talented and have a lot to do in their current position?

We don't advertise that because we haven't run every resume through every parser, so we can't say that they perform as well as Text files. Our advice for folks who are submitting to places where resume parsing software may be used is that they have a text version of their resume on hand as well and then use the Loft Resume for interviews and emails.<p>Most statistics show that 70% of jobs are found through personal networking, while 30% are found through career boards (like Monster.com.) We feel like we fit well with those 70%. However, even within the 30% of jobs that are found through career boards, most of those end in an email and an interview. We think a Loft Resume is a great way to stand out when job candidates do land that interview.",1333755419

Or actually in former times the environment pretty much dictated the diets. So if humans were good at settling in diverse environments, it practically follows that they are good at adapting to different diets.
So maybe not the modern 90% junk diet (sugars and white flour), but the difference between low and high carb might not be so important.<p>Also not sure why pizza tends to be condemned so much. Sure, if you buy a pizza at a restaurant, it is probably soaked in fat and covered with cheap cheese.

So yes, let's say your competitor breaks a story -- if they're the only ones and you write it up based on them bringing the story to your attention, you should give them credit, whether or not that's your only verification that the story happened.<p>However, if you feel that you would have gotten the story anyhow (or, even more likely, you were both working on it at the same time, and they just happened to publish first -- this happens all the time), as long as you were independently able to verify and really didn't rely on them for story, you don't have to credit. And this is a good thing -- you don't want reporters to rush their reporting over something silly like credit. But it's a trust thing, just like sourcing overall is.<p>Another variance: Let's say, for example, that a clown is riding a horse in Time Square, and for some reason you want that story for your Washington state paper. You really shouldn't write about it until you can independently verify. But you can't because you don't have reporters or sources on the scene, and you don't want to credit just the NYT. So then the Boston Globe reports it, then Wash Post -- and all three say they've independently verified the story (vs. citing original NYT report). THEN you can pretty much assume it's fact, then you don't really need to source the papers -- you can say according to multiple reports (or say nothing at all).<p>It also falls back to you can't copyright facts, just the language the information is presented. As a journalist you're responsible for making sure the facts are correct (generally held at 3 sources, whatever they are), but once you've done that, you can go for it.<p>But that's why just not sourcing someone (bad practice) is nothing close to the linked example because plagiarism (exact language = violating copyright) is something you can get sued for.<p>Probably WAY more info than anyone wanted, but FYI in case it helps.",1333754732

There are certainly apps which may want to sacrifice the ease of use and performance advantages of having sync done for you, because they have specialized data sharing requirements.<p>But for a whole lot of apps the benefits of sync far outweigh the contraints of having the same data model on the client and server.<p>Some example use cases where sync can simplify programming (or even make a class of apps possible which would be much harder without it): point-of-sale, retail, medical records (doctor with an iPad and limited wifi), military (need that data no matter what).<p>Here's a pdf of the slides I presented yesterday at Chicago's WindyCityGo conference: <a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14074521/syncpoint-windycity-small.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14074521/syncpoint-windycity-small.p...</a>",1333753602

That would be more pleasant compared to this chest thumping.<p>The traits associated with lispers(lone wolves, nih syndrome, not interested in boring tasks viz. documentation) aren't unique to lipsers. Most of the good programmers, regardless of their language choice, suffer from this mentality, and a lot of good stuff comes out of it.<p>CLOS is cool - I get it. And extending the language by parse time code transformations is cool - I get that too. But does anyone seriously think that's the only thing that makes cool shit possible? There is a lot of great stuff out there which is written in languages which don't have macros, lot of stuff which was written by lone wolves, lot of stuff which existed but was re-written just because.<p>When someone is orgasming to perceived benefits of lisp(not all of it is real), why does he have to make it look like ""look lisp is so powerful, so powerful it's harmful""? Can't you just leave it at lisp is powerful and it helped me build this thing super fast. Why is this pathetic excuse of ""it's so powerful it's harmful"" necessary?<p>And before you take out your pitch forks, please, you aren't the only one who programs lisp. I like Clojure, but mostly because of its nice seq abstractions, small core, interesting concurrency primitives, jvm. Macros are very low in my list of reasons to like Clojure. I tried liking Racket, and though I still like it, I would have preferred a higher level seq abstraction. I have skimmed through ""Practical Common Lisp"" and I fail to see the charm - there isn't anything which can't be conveniently and concisely coded in Ruby or Python. Lisp has its benefits, but they are overblown.",1333753457

There's a free app you can put on your device that will email your UDID to where ever you want, or you can just copy it over from iTunes/XCode. I haven't ever had a client give me the wrong UDID (they have given me the same UDID twice though, forgetting that I already have that device in the database). The hardest part usually is that it can sometimes take 5-6 tries of dragging the app into iTunes (on Windows at least) for it to work. But even that isn't too big of a deal, just quick and easy repetitive motion (once they get the profile installed).<p>I think the biggest pain in the ass is on the developer's side. Anytime you want to run the app on another device, you have to add another UDID to the device list on Apple's site, regenerate your provisioning profile, download it, delete the old adhoc profile from ~/Library/MobileDevices (good luck trying to find out which of the profiles in there is your old adhoc, the files are named with a random string of letters and numbers), install it to XCode, open your project, and change your adhoc build profile settings to the new profile.<p>Phew.",1254239654

The primary reasons for coding web applications in PHP instead of Java, Ruby, or Python or what-have-you is speed and portability. Your code isn't compatible with PHP4 -- which a lot of servers are still running -- and you're spending an awful lot of code to duplicate functionality that's already built into PHP. You can already perform a query and get the results back and if you want to iterate over them, you have an array to step through. That would be maybe around 5 lines of code, and you wouldn't need comments explaining what it does because it would be clear and obvious. That's a lot less code for the parser to evaluate, and a lot less code for it to run, which will probably translate to being able to handle a lot more hits.<p>It would be interesting to load your code onto an app, and then load a simpler, more direct version that does the same thing, and see how their performance compares.<p>Nicely written article though.",1254237628

I've certainly posted hard work on HN plenty of times only to be criticized.<p>Regarding my reaction, it certainly wasn't meant aggressive, but it was a negative review.  I appreciate you getting these two together for an interview, and their disucssion was awesome.  So thank you for that, but as I said previously... your questions seemed to interrupt a good flow of conversation that Armstrong and Jones had for the sake of asking a question.<p>You asked several questions, asserting them in the context of scala. It would have been my personal preference to have JA and SPJ talk about the two languages (Erlang/Haskell) in relation of each other. A compare/contrast, pros/cons, from their perspectives.<p>Finally, these series of questions below, didn't yield information specific to the languages and the setup of the questions left me confused.<p><i>That takes us to a discussion about user's model. For me, as a user of Haskell, I have a mental model that everything is happening by the end. That's what the type system tells me - that everything is saved until the end.  
 Yes. This is in sync with how things happen, but sometimes it gets out of sync. It's the same thing with when you are dealing with processors. You are sending messages, but sometimes it's maybe not that cheap to send a message and also it hits barriers of using this mental model that you established. What do you think of this problem?  
 With any feature of the language, you define a mental model for the programmer, so that the programmer can reason about this feature. The implementation tries to get in sync with this mental model, but it's not always true. In some cases, it gets far from it. It's the same thing with processors, when you are sending messages. It's not exactly the same thing, because you need to copy or you don't need to copy. Sometimes it's not performant to do it that way, you do it another way. What do you think of this problem? The same thing with I/O, that as a programmer I think that is happening by the end, but it is actually happening on the fly, it's happening right away.</i><p>With all that said,  I'm an avid infoq website fan and I <i>do</i> appreciate you getting this interview and your work.

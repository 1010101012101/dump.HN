I think experience of being at both ends of the spectrum can help you ""feel"" the right level of generalization.<p>At first your code is an unmaintainable cesspool of special cases, then you educate yourself ""proper"" design and compulsively try to make your code as uniform as possible and you end up with a cesspool of design patterns. After being on both sides a few times, you should have a better idea of what's worth generalizing in a specific domain.",1280480157

The job is to convince people it's in their self-interest.<p>Meanwhile, only the tiny population of people who are programmers really even have a basic understanding of what Stallman's freedom is all about, and even <i>they</i> do not value it very high.<p>On a micro level I don't care about software freedom that much, because mostly I just want to get something done, and if 0.5% of my yearly income is going to commercial software that I find useful and have no desire to modify, then the freedom issues just don't even enter my conscience.<p>However on a macro level Stallman's slippery slope argument is correct.  If the balance of software shifts to proprietary, then I feel the goodness of software in general is greatly reduced.  If GNU/Linux didn't exist for instance, the technological landscape would be a shadow of what it is today.<p>But I digress... for free software to ever gain any mindshare in the non-developer community would require a stroke of marketing genius the likes of which I've never seen.  It's just not reasonable to rank freedom with such a high priority for the average person who has no ability or desire to modify any software.  There might be a redistribution angle, but again, it would have to be sheer marketing brilliance to convince anyone of that.",1280479518

Isn't the point of free software that people can take the code and build whatever they want to build on top of it?  The consequence: people can use the code it without owing you anything.  Apart from the strictly legal side, there is of course the question of moral behaviour, but even there I don't see the point of the complainers, since<p>* AFAIK, canonical never claimed to be the driving force behind GNOME development.<p>* Even if they could be doing more for the upstream development, what is the net harm that canonical is doing to linux?

If you know exactly what you want, you don't need a designer, and hiring one will just piss both of you off.<p>A 'designer' by definition is someone who designs — comes up with a plan — not someone who implements (which is completely secondary). And frankly, the designer is the expert here, not the client. So all a client should do is fill the brief, and give specific feedback when asked (not say things like ""I like that logo because it looks fresh""). That's it.<p>The client should trust the designer to make the right decisions based on his requirements. And going on the same note, a good designer will ask the right questions and pull a client's requirements out of him. This, you're right about, yes. But clients WANT to guide the designer, so YOU might not want to hold hands all day, but most clients do, and that's why we reach the situation in the first paragraph : <a href=""http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell</a><p>This post is from the point-of-view of a designer, so the client is (obviously) the bad guy. I'm not defending either; just stating why your comment is wrong.",1280477074

Life is risk, some of it you can mitigate, some of it you feel you have to take.<p>But you can limit the damage from the risks you take if you think things through in advance and that's what I mean with 'he doesn't take any chances'.<p>Just like the skydiver you mention, they usually go to extremes to make sure their gear is in proper working order. The skydiver may take a risk jumping out of the plane, the pilot still has to land it, which is a risky operation all by itself. Risk is simply unavoidable, not thinking about risks increases the risks sometimes far more than the risks themselves.",1280477068

I've been considering paying someone to develop an iOS app for an upcoming project I've been working on which is based around subscription to a magazine-like service. The application would need to:<p>* Be built around the Newsstand APIs to display text content<p>* Allow in-app subscription with a free trial<p>* Display text content with appealing and highly readable typography<p>That's pretty much it.

The interface will either.. refocus to the app you are trying to close, or will actually close.  In practice: Toggling first to desktop helps, and normally allows the app to close; Toggling to the Metro home screen pretty much always does not work, the app ends up not closing and taking focus. And more odd: The active-app you are in is never displayed on the left.   My Microsoft friend says you don't need to close apps; that the memory management on the device / OS will ""take care of itself"". I find that not be the case in that closing helps free up resources, and is the only way to restart tanked apps. Lastly: When you are down to only one running app + the home screen (always running?), you cannot close any apps, you can only toggle between them.",1353329575

Everything software does happens more or less without our ability to directly perceive it, it's just electrons shuffling around in silicon, and it's very hard to get a sense of the scale of anything because even at the high end of the scale where banks of computers are running, it's still just banks of computers humming along invisibly computing, there aren't tons of Earth being moved or ships crossing across oceans and so forth.<p>Anyway, our industry is one of the most diverse in the history of industry. It spans scales across factors of not just billions but trillions. And it ranges in complexity and seriousness across similar scales.<p>Imagine the ""container"" industry, which spans all the way from someone making wicker baskets in their spare time and selling them on ebay all the way up to perhaps the fuel tanks of orbital launch vehicles or the steel reinforced concrete containment vessel of a nuclear fission reactor. Or consider vehicles, which can be anything from a plastic tricycle all the way up to an aircraft carrier. Nobody would imagine that those industries are monolithic or that the way to run a tricycle factory is necessarily the same as the way you'd run a shipyard.<p>Yet here we are in 2012 and people who should know better still insist that running a ""software company"" is a singly story with a single set of best practices and a universal set of advice that applies equally well to every variant.

There two specific problems with the post: a) in general (unless you are lucky), all good things require hard work so what's so special about entrepreneurship?; b) this interpretation of entrepreneurship is clouded by a specific type of startup (and I am guessing for a founder with a specific personality type who gets a kick out of such emotional turmoil -- I am probably like that but it doesn't change the argument).<p>Athletes, politicians, charity workers, soldiers, scientists and many others work hard even when outcomes are unpredictable. Even people with so-called ""normal"" jobs may require episodes of such unpredictability and hard work. Why specifically elevate entrepreneurship?<p>And, frankly, such lifestyle even for an entrepreneur is a choice. I see no point in re-iterating the obvious that doing a startup <i>may</i> be hard if you are aiming to build a huge business. If it were easy, most people would be doing it, no?  I fail to see the whole point of the article.<p>To be fair, I did write about how is it in the life of an entrepreneur (specifically it was about my day): <a href=""http://paraschopra.com/blog/personal/startup-an-emotional-roller-coaster-ride.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paraschopra.com/blog/personal/startup-an-emotional-ro...</a> but my aim there was to document how is the day in life of a founder at a startup that is still in early days and I tried hard to avoid generalizing or glamorizing the hardships.

No LaTeX editor I've ever used, and I've used several including Lyx, is much better.  They get a little better with something like a WYSIWYG HTML editor, but that's really a word processor too.

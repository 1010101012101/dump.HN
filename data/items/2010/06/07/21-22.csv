In all of apple's products, I've always notice they try to widen the moat with their hardware and design capabilities (ie: reengineering of the MBP batteries, unibody chassis, multi-touch screens on phone/tablet, a4 chip, etc).<p>And if you look at Apple's iPhone Design page, it is devoted to mainly hardware upgrades and the marketing focuses on user-experience benefits of such upgrades. And these improvements just so happen to be in areas that aren't easily replicable by competitors like Google (because their expertise is in software).",1275947866

I assume that they will introduce tools/APIs to do ads later, but if I memory serves me correctly, they haven't confirmed this.<p>I can see that they do it this way for two reasons: first, typical Apple priorization: no time to do everything with limited resources so they first do tools for themselves and then polish them for others. Second, by doing polished ads themselves, they create an example of ad-culture they want.<p>Interesting aspect of iAds is that they require a much more work than e.g. Google Adwords. This means that an ad agency ecosystem will evolve around these ads. My guess is that agencies that specialize on these ads will have to take a big role in selling these ads to advertisers.

1412084,comment,1410890,1410890,0,0,marknutter,,,"I've been working on a site for the better part of the past year that I made to try to address a lot of the issues that caused me to leave Digg and to a lesser extent Reddit called <a href=""http://chirplinks.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chirplinks.com</a> and Digg 4.0 is getting dangerously close to some of the ideas I had when I first started building it.<p>As the OP mentions, as the Digg community grew larger the frontpage stories became less and less relevant to me and frankly, pretty crappy, and I found myself pining for the days of old when Digg was largely a tech-geek community.  The big reason I spend most of my time on HN is because the demographic is a lot more focused.<p>The light bulb moment for me came from my time playing with the Twitter API and getting more into Twitter in general. I had spent all this time cultivating my friends list on Twitter and I was getting a lot of great links from them, but not enough to where it would replace a good bookmarking site like HN or Reddit. It then occurred to me if there was a system that would intelligently start adding my friend's most trusted friends to my social graph based on the links I click on, save, hide, dislike, etc. I could build out my own social bookmarking community that was highly focused in on the things I am personally interested in.<p>So a friend of mine and I built it and actually just recently (quietly) took it out of closed beta to get some feedback. If anybody is interested in trying it out, feel free, although to get the full effect you need a Twitter account with a decent amount of friends.  We plan on removing this restriction though so that anybody can jump in, pick a few topics of interest, and start growing their mini-Digg so to speak.<p>The problem I see with Digg is that they're trying to become yet another social network (YASN as I call it).  I honestly can't see myself going through the process of finding friends all over again - I barely put in the effort to manage Twitter and Facebook.  We built Chirplinks to work perfectly well without a full network effect.  We figure why force users to build another circle of friends when they've already done that on other sites.<p>Anyways, I'd love to hear some fellow HNer's opinions on it, even if you don't want to try it out just feedback on the general concept would be awesome.",1275947592

Just by being human I can say we are quite capable of telling if someone is looking at a point a couple of inches from our eyes from across a table (can usually tell which eye they are dominant in and which of your eyes they are looking at).  So if your face is in the middle of other screen and they look down at that image instead of at the camera, the question becomes will the resolution of your image of them be enough to tell?  I bet it will be easier to tell if they look back and forth between the camera to the image.  And better video quality and distances to the phones will, of course, make it easier to see the lack of true eye-contact.<p>So, in addition to just holding your phone further away, maybe everyone can aim their own phone's camera so that the image of them on the other phone has their eyes as close to the camera as possible.

Wouldn't you use this free feature if it came at no cost? I know I'd LOVE it.<p>Other than the points highlighted above (and cost of video call), the big question is how are video calls done in Asia. Does it require the user to spend more than 3-4 secs to set up a video call (check if the other person has video call support, is he on the same network, do some prior WiFi settings, etc.).

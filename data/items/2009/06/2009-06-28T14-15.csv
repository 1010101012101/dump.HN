677729,comment,677655,677655,0,0,colomon,,,"The thing that really rings true in this story for me is the difficulty that management sometimes has understanding how hard the things we do are.  It particularly shows up in cases that might sound like this one, where the solution is simple but hard to see.<p>For instance, I recently corrected a bug in my code that had been there for a long time.  The final code is dead simple.  But it took years to detect the bug, and weeks of hard work and analysis to figure out that simple solution.  (And of course, who knows -- maybe it's not as hard as I thought, and if I were just brilliant enough I would have instantly seen the solution.  If I have no clue what the truth of the matter is, how is my (hypothetical) one step removed boss supposed to make sense of it?)",1246200017

677726,story,,,3,4,RiderOfGiraffes,"Neil Armstrong and the missing ""a"".",,"As we come up to the 40th anniversary of the moon landings, I've just been watching a program about the Apollo program.  In a rather rare interview with Neil Armstrong I noticed something interesting.<p>Transcribing part of the interview, I get this:<p><pre><code>    The descent was very tricky business.

    The challenge was to try to land at a relatively
    specific landing site that had no runway, no control
    tower, no radar, and no navigation aids.

    Our plan was to start at a specific point in lunar
    orbit at about 50,000 feet altitude, and something
    over 3000 miles per hour, to use one continuous
    rocket burn to decelerate to a hover in the landing
    area.
</code></pre>
The first ""a"" before ""relative"" is extremely short, and there is no ""a"" at all in the first sentence.  It's true that the first sentence above does parse without the ""a"", but it also parses with one.<p>Armstrong has said that he intended to have an ""a"" in that sentence, that he rehearsed it, and that he thought he said it.  He has also had the recording played to him many times, and has finally admitted that it's not there, and he's surprised.<p>My theory is that it's a dialectic elision.  His brain said it, but his speech path never passed it on to the rest of us.",1246199747

However, two diametrically opposite extremes are presented, instead of a more realistic situation, making the value of the parable zero and none.<p>For instance, were the 'enterprise' team to be headed by a capable technical lead that forces his team to produce reasonably readable, reasonably documented, reasonably maintainable and futureproof code, then the situation would already be very different. If we add to that that the inexperienced hacker prodigy would produce working code much faster, but his code would turn out to be brittle when someone else has to take care of it, because he does not yet have experience in interacting with lesser gods via his code, then the match would be even more equal. We may still prefer the hacker, but we would be forced to think about the trade offs involved.",1246199434

Aaron Wall has a great pyramid for expertise in an arbitrary market -- the beginners always outnumber the intermediates who outnumber...  SEOMoz Pro is targeted at, if I don't miss my guess, high beginning/low intermediate.  If you can't look at the SERP for [bingo cards] and say ""This is competitive but not nearly as competitive as [student credit cards]"" then they have a tool which will tell you exactly that and that provides value.  For businesses who are in that sweet spot it is totally a no-brainer.<p>With regards to the workflow bit: SEO is primarily a game of link acquisition at the competitive levels.  One common strategy for acquiring them is to identify pages on the Internet that would be good links and then email the people in charge of them to ask for the link.  A lot of the SEOMoz tools are designed to make this process more efficient.  I have deep misgivings about it (from both a it-is-a-nuisance and the-ROI-is-inferior-to-less-annoying-alternatives perspectives) and don't practice it myself, so those aren't so useful for me.<p>I would like to flatter myself and say I'm a wee bit above low-intermediate in SEO.  I mostly use the Rank Tracker, and the other tools have not frequently given me actionable information.  That said, I am not displeased with my $80 a month or whatever it was.  If there is ONE thing I wish everyone at HN understood in their bones about SEO, it is that the ROI on it is just freaking amazing.  Pick a number beyond your wildest dreams, no, it is better than that.  In that context, I often spend speculatively on it, and ~100 a month is easy to justify even if it only results in positive decisions once a year.<p>(Edited to add: Don't let the Internet Marketing crowd fleece you, though.)",1246199133

As George Orwell argued in his 1946 essay 'Politics and the English language' (<a href=""http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit</a>): clarity of language is closely bound to clarity of thought. Everyone should be encouraged to write as clearly as possible, to avoid confusion and muddling of thoughts.<p>Of course, the grandparent overstates his case and is unconstructive as a result. His fallacy is that he argues that someone must be an idiot, because they make a trivial error. Which overlooks the fact that trivial errors are made by experts all the time, exactly <i>because</i> it's a trivial point that doesn't have their attention.

677713,comment,677125,677629,0,0,Confusion,,,"Yes, all <i>those</i> things <i>are</i> determined by scale, because there is a clear cost involved, that requires a certain scale to pay for itself. However, in the case of closing tags the cost is negligible, so it's something that can be used by everyone. Google claims (however, I still can't find the link that shows) that loading/rendering their search result pages slower makes people perform less searches. That's why they do not allow you to have more than 10 results per page; not even via your personal settings. The same trade off will hold for every service whose profitability is directly dependent on the number of page views. So it's not scale, just the sort of business you are in that determines whether not closing tags makes sense.",1246198064

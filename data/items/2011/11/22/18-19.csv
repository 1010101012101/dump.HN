This fits their emphasis on user-friendliness, as the packages in more stable Debian branches can be years old, in some cases. In essence, Ubuntu has chosen features over stability. In this, it's much more friendly than vanilla Debian, especially for the GUI-only user, but tends to have more bugs (including APT packaging/dependency bugs) than the legendarily rock-solid Debian.",1321988351

I was the lead on a team that took $150k in funding and produced an open-source implementation of some CDC specifications (<a href=""https://github.com/talho/openphin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/talho/openphin</a>), and became the first software in the country to be certified with it. We developed it in about 12 weeks, and the first milestone certifications were actually complete-able (meaning we had the features, though the paperwork took longer) within 2 weeks. We were up against companies used in other states like Northrup and SAIC that literally spent millions on the implementations (and don't even get me started on how much those same companies spent coming up with the standards in the first place, which is a whole 'nother problem) and beat them handily at their own game.<p>We did use private contractors as additional assets starting out and while they were more expensive than hiring additional developers, they had two great attributes: temporary, and good at what they did. Its worth it to pay for competence, every single time. And when its a one-time expense for a project, its much, much easier to deal with than something that incurs year-over-year expenditures.",1321988314

But at 23 I wasn't near equipped to build a product from scratch.<p>What you really need is a CTO that gets founder equity. But you already have a CTO and it sounds like they don't bring much to the table besides you being comfortable with them. Which is important no doubt about it.<p>So you've got all the founders you need, but still don't have a means to build the product. Building a product from the ground up for non-founder equity and room and board is ridiculous. If you are competing for people with the skills to build a product from zero to MVP and beyond on a global scale, you must realize these same people have the opportunity to do the same thing somewhere else but for an equity share matching their contribution.<p>I see you have a few options:<p>* Pay your hackers market salary minus local COL. (2 month contract I'm guessing would be about 20k per head)<p>* Outsource the job (Guessing somewhere around 50k)<p>* Replace your CTO with someone who can commit and build the product.

My conclusion about that company (after about six months of working there) was that its core competency wasn't writing software. The software was a shoddy pile of half-working crap written in a proprietary programming language made by another company that didn't exist any more. No, their core competency was 1) navigating government bureaucracy and 2) filling out government forms. These two competencies ensured that there was never a need to actually produce good software because few competitors would have the time and contacts to even bid on the contract, much less secure it and write good software.",1321988095

As an example, let's think of classical geometry.  They figured out the area of circles, the volumes of cones, etc without any calculus.  If you know the tricks you can figure it out too, or you can just apply a little calculus and it just falls out.  I feel that people dismiss the math as unnecessary because they can get by without it, but in reality the math is always there and sometimes provides much simpler solutions.<p>I've found over the last few years that my thinking has morphed from primarily OO to primarily functional.  It isn't for lack of writing OO code, which I do professionally.  I find that my brain loves to think in terms of functional transformations on classes of data types.<p>Suddenly I find myself noticing when things should be expressed as a monad or monoid.  I also find myself thinking in type signatures for dynamic languages and silently cursing the language designer who decided a function can return null without warning.

These are all serious institutions, of course, and of course by national standards even the huge public ones are selective. But I've also noticed (this is just my own experience) that top ""tech"" companies considerably less concerned with whether you went to a ""top"" school in the first place.<p>I wonder why this is - I mean, I'm glad for it. I have a few theories.<p>The typical techie degree programss (math, physics, computer science, engineering) are so rigorous that people tend to respect the accomplishment (as long as it comes from a recognizable school with integrity).<p>Tech is a fundamentally creative field, rather than a positional - in other words, techies have the opportunity to create wealth rather than position themselves for a slice of the pie. If you can create wealth, well, get out there and do it! No permission is required.<p>On a similar note, high tech is extremely disruptive - time and again, tech founders overthrow the established order. These disruptive people often do come from Stanford or Harvard, but I think the personality type of someone who seeks to disrupt the ruling elite is going to be more open to top talent regardless of where it comes from (unlike investment banking or law firms, where (according to the article) graduates of super-elite schools are likely to filter out people who haven't attended a similar school).<p>Also - high tech tends to have a closer, more symbiotic relationship with academics than investment banking or even law. So high tech will place a greater premium on degrees from universities where top research in engineering and science takes place - not so much out of snobbery as because they have a close connection with these universities and get to know the students there. Interestingly, this doesn't correlate all that well with eliteness of undergraduate admissions (the ivy league, in particular, is surprisingly MIA where it comes to top graduate and or faculty departments in engineering and science... Cornell, which isn't high in the ivy pecking order, is probably one of the best).",1321987157

The key here is that the crazy signature of the map method simply means <i>the map method will do what you expect</i>. That's it! But I would write X to do it in my language is irrelevant, because <i>you don't write the map method</i>. It's provided. There's a paper that describes why the signature is how it is and everything, but you don't <i>care</i>, because it's complicated so that when you're actually using it, <i>it just works</i>.",1321986804

Still you have the basic idea and it's downsides.  Still normally your dealing with larger objects so the overhead is a little different.<p>Just think about how a you normally work with objects.  Normally you have a pointer to some allocated memory  locationObjectPointer = (x00100) which points to a chunk of memory the size of 3 floats (x,y,z).   Now normally when you update x and y you overwrite their memory locations which is fast in single threaded programming but you need to worry about something reading after you update x at (x00100) but before you update y (x00104).<p>However, if instead of updating in that memory block you created a new object locationObjectPointer2 = (x00600) copy'd what was in the original object and then when your done changed the pointer from the old object to your new one.

They certainly don't get to talk about 'their land' in any meaningful sense.<p>Israel occupied the West Bank, the Sinai Peninsula, the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights after winning the Six-Day War. When Egypt - twelve years and another war later - negotiated a peace treaty with Israel, Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula to them, and it once again became Egyptian.<p>Syria hasn't shown much interest in negotiating peace with Israel, and that's why the Golan Heights are not Syrian at the moment - and the way things are going, likely never will be.<p>The Palestinians also haven't shown much interest in peace. The Israelis have made many generous offers over the years  - the Palestinians could've easily negotiated peace and established a state at the Oslo Accords or the Camp David Accords. They declined to do so. When they eventually decide that they do want peace, then 'their land' will be what they negotiate - but until then, they've got they same status as Germans or Japanese in the immediate aftermath of WWII.<p>Considering Israel's historical and religious ties to the land, and considering that there's been over <i>forty years</i> to sort out peace, they've been incredibly tolerant by not annexing the entire West Bank outright. (Which they've quite plausibly got the right to do - Israel may have signed the Fourth Geneva Convention, but the West Bank wasn't claimed by another sovereign state at the time of its occupation.)  European countries aren't nearly as generous when they win wars - which is why Gdask is Polish, Bolzano is Italian, Kaliningrad is Russian, and Hungary is a whole lot smaller than it used to be.<p>Again, I have to question why people want to hold the world's only Jewish state to a standard followed by no other country.",1321985648

3266588,comment,3265625,3266336,2,0,nateps,,,"Hey, I am one of the authors of Derby. Knockout and Backbone are pretty different, and they both have good aspects. Knockout's strength is its powerful view-model bindings, and Backbone is targeted at providing an MVC structure. However, neither of these libraries claim to be a complete solution. If you want a more full-featured client framework similar to these, SproutCore is one of the better ones right now.<p>The reason we started working on Derby, is that none of these frameworks offer a full-stack solution. Backbone and SproutCore will provide better structure and some automation of client-server data syncing. However, they still require manually creating appropriate server routes that handle AJAX requests and communicate with a database. They may provide client-side routing, but these routes are totally different from the server routes, so if you want to use the same URLs, you have to duplicate routing code. SproutCore uses Handlebars, so you might be able to render the same templates on the server for faster page rendering, and non-JavaScript browser or search engine crawler accessibility. However, this will require writing a bunch of custom server code to pull out the right data and render the templates. In addition, none of these frameworks provide tools to deal with data conflicts. Conflicts are inevitable in a multiple users realtime application, especially when supporting offline.<p>Derby's focus is to unify as much code between server and client and to provide automatic realtime syncing among all models and views. This approach requires less code, delivers faster load times, provides instant client-side rendering from full pages to individual data bindings, and supports offline by default. It's a work in progress, but let us know what you think about it so far.",1321985342

The first several times I tried and failed, I assumed it was a fluke.  That these thing sometimes worked and sometimes didn't led me to believe that these were ephemeral problems, and I must have wasted hours retrying things.  If that had been the case, I would have just arrived early and done it the old-fashioned.  Ultimately, that's what I did, although their internal systems are just as screwed (and I don't think hand-written passenger manifests cut the muster anymore).<p>Anyway, on my second pass through this mess, I just skipped the website entirely and did everything at the airport.  Took a little longer, but it was pretty stress-free.  I'd recommend doing so if you're flying with them soon.<p>To their credit, they did give us miles and candy, and the staff is still the best in the biz.  And, if you're flying through SFO, you can make the best of your residual time with a solid burger and a decent drink at Lark Creek Grill.",1321985141

However, between my laptops at home and at work I don't really need a third one, and since I already have the iPad I'd rather make as much I can with it for short trips where I am not going have too much time and/or wifi to pull sustained work sessions.<p>> It could be used for reading I guess..<p>That too. For an academic, GoodReader is a blessing. I have finally stopped printing out loads of articles and/or finding that I printed out this same article a couple of years ago. Not to mention Kindle etc. Again, if I were spending significant amounts of time away from either home or the office, I'd consider investing in a proper portable laptop; but I'm not, and for my use case the iPad is ideal.<p>>  can't run what I want to run<p>Yep, I agree that it's frustrating.<p>> (not an Eee ffs, a real laptop).<p>No everybody can afford another proper laptop that's as easy to carry around as an iPad, y'know.<p>Anyway, YMMV, of course.

Peter Thiel's call for radical philanthropy addresses this issue - that funding has become staid, and there needs to be more high-risk, high reward research funding akin to the venture industry. See:<p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2011/11/the-need-for-visionary-philanthopy-in-longevity-science.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2011/11/the-need-for-visi...</a><p>""So after Mayo Clinic researchers discovered they could delay degeneration of the tissues in a fast-aging strain of mice by purging senescent cells, they applied to the agency's National Institute on Aging for financing for the next essential step, that of repeating the test in mice with a normal life span. Under the agency's peer review system, panels of fellow experts judge each proposal and assign it a score. On paper, it's hard to think of a better system. But in practice, experts often differ, even on the best proposals, and a single dissenting vote can reduce a proposal's overall score too low to get financed. The Mayo proposal got a less than perfect score, and was denied money. ... Their peer review process is not promoting innovative, high-risk research. ... They were able to get their research started only because private funds were available from the Ellison Medical Foundation, supported by Larry Ellison of the Oracle software company, and from Robert P. Kogod, a philanthropist in Washington. After publication of the Mayo Clinic team's paper in Nature this month, they were approached by the Glenn Foundation, set up by the commodities trader Paul F. Glenn, who has a longstanding interest in aging research. The foundation gave them an unsolicited $60,000 and said it would be around to talk later.""<p>You'll recognize a number of those names as supporters of the SENS Foundation and Methuselah Foundation before it over the past four or five years, having put millions of dollars collectively into the work of those organizations on (a) the basis for rejuvenation biotechnology and (b) what might charitably be looked on as kicking the research community in the pants to make them get on and do the damn job and make some noise about it.<p>In fact wherever there is somewhat innovative research into aging and longevity - looking at repair, not just trying to find drugs to replicate the effects of calorie restriction and push through the same old tired FDA processes - you'll see many of the same visionary philanthropists behind the scenes.<p>A related item by Aubrey de Grey on why people with the means are not pumping as much funding as they can into longevity science, given the clear and amazing payoffs:<p><a href=""http://hplusmagazine.com/2011/11/21/why-arent-more-wealthy-people-funding-aging-research/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hplusmagazine.com/2011/11/21/why-arent-more-wealthy-p...</a>",1321985029

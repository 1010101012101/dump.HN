There's plenty more where those came from, and as you branch into the multi-person studios who have the <i>gall</i> and <i>audacity</i> to charge a nominal fee, you find mid-length games in more and more genres.

1402889,comment,1401117,1401800,0,0,philwelch,,,"Interestingly, if you did store your string as (length, data) pairs, strlen would be an O(1) rather than an O(n), which would also impact strcat. Also, strtok could possibly become non-destructive.<p>The length value of the pair could be an 8 bit character value at the beginning of the array (which is how Pascal did it). That limits you to strings of length 255. If you represented strings as a struct containing an integer length and a char * pointing to the head of the array, the size limit of a string would in fact be no less than the limit of the length of any addressable array anyway. (Assuming that the head of the array is at memory address 1, the farthest it could possibly stretch is to the highest addressable memory value for an n-bit pointer. So an n-bit integer for the length value would clearly suffice.)",1275605722
1402888,comment,1402544,1402544,0,0,throwaway123,,,"Let me explain why I have learned to hate SEO over the years.<p>I'm writing this from a throwaway HN account.  I work for a 4-year old company, where I was one of the first 3 employees.  We have a very popular website that gets over 400 million page views per month.  We get lots of traffic from Google.  When I started, our priority was making a great, simple user interface.  But we were also very aware of SEO, and paid much attention to self-links we put on the site, anchor text, URL parameters, all the usual smart SEO stuff.  So far so good -- we did this opportunistically, and never at the expense of the user experience.<p>As we grew, we hired a person dedicated to SEO (a non-programmer).  Then we hired another.  These SEO people started having us add links and pages in strange places that made no sense to actual users.  And adding links that sometimes made sense to users, but were unnecessary, and cluttered the user interface.  The page footer grew and grew, eventually spanning 3 lines.  We added funny redirect schemes that made the site slower for users.  We were afraid of our links to other sites because we might leak valuable ""Google juice"".  We added redundant tooltips that were useless to users.  Many of these tactics were crap our SEO people read on some webmaster SEO forum, with no scientific basis.  Sometimes our SEO people even had the gall to say ""I have an idea I think will be better for the user experience"", and go on to propose something that only benefited SEO, and made the user experience worse!  In other words, they would focus on GETTING the user (via Google), but forgot about KEEPING the user (through good user experience).  Thankfully, we never did the black-hat methods like cloaking, but some things very close were proposed and met with loud opposition from our developers.<p>For a long time I would fight against these changes, because they made the UI worse.  I lost most of these battles because it was hard to convince the managers that it was hurting the site (but it never seemed to be necessary for the SEO people to prove it was actually helping SEO).  I was eventually spending so much energy fighting these SEO proposals that I just gave up.  User interface designers and developers spend a lot of effort to make a web site look good and run fast.  Then the SEO people go and fuck it up.  It's very frustrating for developers.  I know SEO is important.  All I'm saying is that SEO should never be at the expense of the user experience.  I hate what it has done to our web site, and I know it's happened to other websites as well.",1275605718

Your points are noted, although I don't necessarily agree with all of them.<p>To me, ""some people"" does not imply strictly more than one.  That's possibly a mathematician thing.<p>But the point about mixing implementation detail and interface requirements, this is normal in much of the coding I do.  I'm often working in a constrained environment, and performance requirements are very much a part of the specification.  Stating that something must happen ""in place"" is a common requirement for me, and goes beyond saying ""must not malloc"" or whatever.  More, it's having someone being able to cope with the mix that I was, in part, looking for.<p>I'm also well aware that many of the people here on HN do big machine programming, or web programming, and aren't accustomed to constrained programming.

A team working on a formula 1 car could find a way to increase down force by 5%, or they could install a GPS system to analyze turns and scrape 1/100s of seconds off of lap times, and that edge could help them win.<p>Startups are cars with a very different purpose. They are project cars, and they have 1 purpose: to go. Forget GPS systems and down force. These cars need tires and a working steering wheel. It would be a mistake to think about installing spoilers on a car that doesn't have all 4 tires, just as it would be a mistake to worry about ideal liquidity ratios in a startup.

I currently get vastly more gameplay out of my 4 year old DS lite (I basically have nothing to do on my lunch break other than listen to radio, no access to computers and barely anyone to talk to) than I do out of anything else. So much so that I'm currently considering picking up a PSP to expand my game selection.<p>I've spent 2 months trying to play through Dragonage, but can't find enough time to actually sit down and enjoy it, and any actual free time I do have I have priorities elsewhere, like trying to keep my writing skills exercised so I don't become an illiterate troll.",1275602867

SEO is a necessary lubricant, but in a perfect world, it doesn't exist.<p>b) the context SEO operates in is derivative, not fundamental. SEO may need to deal with 50b+ indexes, but the context is <i>not</i> google. The context is parasitic.<p>c) the business model and ROI calculations of many SEO companies are self-serving, magical, non-scientific, and non-provable.

1402757,comment,1401871,1401871,0,0,samstokes,,,"`defprotocol` and `extend-protocol` remind me of type classes and type class instances in Haskell.  The latter provide the same kind of ad-hoc polymorphism - i.e. you can tell the compiler that your custom datatype implements a predefined protocol, and then code that talks to that protocol automatically works with your new datatype, in a statically type-safe and (I believe) efficient way.<p>For example, this (built-in) type class is similar to Java's `toString()`:<p><pre><code>    class Show a where\n      show :: a -> String\n\n    -- works with any instance of Show\n    showTwice :: (Show a) => a -> String\n    showTwice s = show s ++ show s\n\n    data Fruit = Orange | Apple\n\n    instance Show Fruit where\n      show Orange = ""orange""\n      show Apple = ""apple""\n\n    x = Orange\n    show x       -- => ""orangeorange""\n</code></pre>\nCan anyone more familiar with Clojure (or Haskell for that matter) compare and contrast?",1275602549

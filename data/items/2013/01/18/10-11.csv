Firstly, glhaynes posted this comment after my edit (can no one see my edit!?). That means glhaynes posted a comment on a comment that I had retracted without acknowledging that. Why?<p>2. <i>and the app is free</i>\nYou can still sell something that is free.<p>3. Simplicity can be difficult to achieve. I would argue that your app, would be simpler to use if it had an undo button. If I sketch a face and completely ruin it with one errant line, it is simpler for me to tap undo than to start from scratch. How is an undo button adding any more complexity than clear or save?<p>4. <i>And, if you're gonna have all that, why not also allow various thicknesses of the drawing tool? And colors?</i>\nWhy have save, clear, share, print, copy or mail? I would argue that adding an eraser can be done in a way where that is extremely intuitive, certainly a lot more intuitive than double tapping a grabber.<p>5. The only reasons for not having an eraser or undo in this case (simplicity is not a reason in this case as the ux is already complex) is that it is a feature of the app to not be able to hide mistakes or change what has been done (`I agree that this is similar to sketching on paper) or some misguided use of skeuomorphism. The summary fails to go into this.<p>So That is why I disagree that it is a great summary.",1358506737

Depression completely warps reality.<p>Yes. And this is the bit for which Aaron carried some responsibility, if you're prone to depression you should <i>not</i> position yourself in situations where extreme stress and threats to your personal freedom might result. Being a person prone to depression and being an activist that takes very visible steps antagonizing powerful entities is not something that you should want to combine in the same person. That didn't stop Aaron from being who he was though and in some sense he seems to have felt driven to do these things. Note that I say this as a strong supporter of everything that Aaron stood for and fought for.<p>> Also, I'd like to add that given this, I think we're all being a bit unfair to the prosecutor.<p>No we're not. She's been using people to further her career. This is disgusting.<p>> But it's very possible she triggered an underlying mental illness in Aaron.<p>She pushed him to the brink and then across it. There is no excuse for such behavior.<p>> Yes, she is partly to blame. But so is everyone else.<p>This we agree on.<p>> MIT didn't step up.<p>They did the opposite, they pushed for punishment including jail time according to most accounts.<p>> But also his loved ones near him didn't do enough to help.<p>You know <i>NOTHING</i> about that and should refrain from such comments.<p>> It's quite simply a tragedy.<p>No, it is an utter failure of the judicial system.<p>> Painting Ortiz as a murderer is as wrong a painting Swartz as a felon deserving of a 35 year prison sentence.<p>Nobody is painting Ortiz as a murderer, and she painted Swartz as a felon deserving of a 35 year prison sentence and now tries to make it seem as if that was just business as usual.

Even as plea negotiations went forward, the implication was ""plead this out or you will get 35 years"".<p>She made statements that only a lawyer could love - rife with plausible deniability for any responsibility they have in this mess.  However, I think any reasonable person would agree with Linus's interpretation of the two statements.",1358503572

A couple of the Android users in the office came over to see what I was moaning about.<p>After 60 seconds of looking at it they both admitted that the thing I was moaning about was horrible but that it wasn't something they had to deal with on their Galaxy S3s. When they showed me the S3 it's mechanism was definitely more intuitive (at least to the three of us).<p>While I'm not defending the skinning efforts of OEMs generally, I don't think the historical position of ""it's all awful"" is necessarily true any more. Sure there are bad things in there but there were plenty of bad things in early versions of Android. Just as Google learned there are signs that the OEMs are learning too.",1358503547

Would it be interesting to know the ratio of years charged vs years pleaded - especially by race and offence and state?<p>Edit: no not trying to compare this in degree with marching thousands to death in gulags - just we should focus on fixing a justice system that basically tries to avoid the courts because of those awkward and time consuming human rights.  I mean imagine if we had to deal with terrorists instead of copyright violators - we might skip plea bargaining and do something silly in Cuba.

Any admission, any implicit acceptance of responsibility, even a moral one could come back to haunt her in a possible civil suit. She's already fighting that battle today, even though the first shot may never be fired. To do otherwise would be morally honorable but from a legal point extremely bad strategy.<p>This is the world we have all crafted and Ortiz is still in gameplay mode. If she could accept her own responsibility in this she'd likely never have made it to the position she is in, weaseling through cracks to avoid culpability is second nature in politics.",1358503530

I think sometimes people forget that they aren't actually that unique. We're all naked under our clothes. Most people aren't special enough that anyone cares about seeing a pixelated naked image of them.<p>The guy in the TSA booth sees thousands of naked people a day. He's not laughing at you, he's just trying to get through his day.

I already have a NAS, so stuff like home automation and whatever I would first try to run via the NAS to limit the amount of computers that suck power.<p>In fact there is already a number of computers in my household that I could hack instead of the Pi. The router, the Wii, the TV, tablets, smartphones, older phones... - they all have small Linux computers embedded and often there are homebrew projects going on to make them hackable.<p>Right now there is also a plethora of new devices coming out that are also very cheap. For example, I have bookmarked the TP-Link TL-MR3020 Portable 3G/3.75G Wireless-LAN Router (<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/akpbwb6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/akpbwb6</a> ) which somebody blogged about - not sure what kind of CPU it has, but it is 30 (about the same as the Pi), comes with a box, power cable, WiFi and 3G. Presumably very cheap tablets (include a screen) are coming out of China, too.<p>Don't get me wrong, I think the Pi is super cute and it inspires me and makes me want to do something with it. What I mean to say is that I suspect it has become a hit just like other hits: by luck and random chance.",1358503461

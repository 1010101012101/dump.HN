And this is what the networks (NBC/Fox/etc.) do best so I think they're going to be around much longer than the RIAA. It's very inexpensive to record quality music using home equipment (hence RIAA is screwed), but home videos are still far from the quality of network produced shows. There is a downward trend in cost to produce TV shows and movies, but it isn't quite as cheap and easy yet.<p>2. The big screen in the living room. This too is here to stay, though it will evolve from just a medium to watch TV shows and movies to something that'll be more interactive+connected+social.",1236106780

Reality shows like American Idol and Big Brother are unlikely to end up downloaded, because they're not worth watching if you don't watch them right away.<p>This is probably a huge component in why there are so many more reality shows these days.<p>Breaking the broadcast model also won't work for those, because their value is precisely in the fact that a lot of people watch them, so that they become gossip points. I know some people who watch reality shows only because they know that's what will be discussed around the water fountain the next day, and so they want to be sure to be ""in"".<p>I agree that that's a pretty small niche to fit all of today's TV industry, though.",1236106507

We have one electric grid, but electricity is generated by a number of companies. Your examples show that having a single <i>standard</i> is good, not necessarily that a single product is good.<p>A single browser is a bad idea for several reasons. Firstly, there would be an inclination toward being very conservative. If you make a breaking change, you break every site on the web. If you implement a new feature, you'd better be sure it's the right feature, or be stuck with it for a good many years to come. If you have a bug, fixing it could break sites that rely on that bug for rendering.<p>Conversely, if you have several browsers in the market, each can afford to try out different things. Opera has done a lot with SVG; Safari has added a lot of custom CSS effects; Firefox is doing some interesting work with inline videos and faster Javascript.<p>Secondly, different browsers fit different niches that aren't necessarily compatible. Do you make your uberbrowser fast and lean? Or plug in a lot of extensions? Add a mail client? A bittorrent client? Should you have a smart address bar? Something that integrates well with a particular OS? Something that can be run on a phone? Or a console? Or a PC? Or a netbook?<p>Third, I'm not aware of any software product that has been written in a competition-free enviroment and has turned out to be any good.<p>Fourth, the state of standard support in browsers generally isn't that bad. If your site works in Firefox, it probably works in Safari and Opera as well. I have very little problems when it comes to cross-browser support... <i>except</i> when it comes to IE. I don't presume to speak for everyone here, but 99% of all my browser headaches in the last few years can be laid squarely at the door of Microsoft.<p>In other words, the root of most browser woes is due to IE, which web developers support because it has a majority market share, a market share maintained by Microsoft's rather <i>anti</i>-competitive practise of bundling it's browser with its OS.

The downside, however, of not having Tim MC an <i>smallish</i> event such as these upgrades is that it puts more pressure on whatever attempts to be the standard Apple-fare fanfare.<p>The longer the wait the more Steve's absence at such an event will be felt.  But... if they <i>can</i> get him back in July or so... <i>and</i> they have a major announcement... that'll make for a huge hype opportunity.  And yes:  it's just playing with fans' minds. That's okay by me:  I'm just up for learning about marketing - and Apple's certainly one place to do it.",1236104329

What they failed to realize was that the driving force behind the portal was the fact that people were still trying to find information (i.e. search).  Yahoo started as a search engine that lost its focus.  Did Facebook start as a ""status update"" site that got lost somewhere along the way?<p>So the article begs the question: is the real reason people are driven to Facebook is to see their friend's status updates?",1236104142

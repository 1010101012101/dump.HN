The next 6 months however I will be paid back the diff and also get my market salary, provided there is money. 
I will be the first employee who's a developer. (The CTO is a fairly awesome coder, so its not like I am the first developer or building stuff from scratch.) However the development work wll be non-trivial.
The only thing which is bothering my is that there is NO EQUITY being offered. The reason being that the company is based in U.S.A while I will be working in its office at a foreign location.<p>To be fair, It will be a new domain I will be working on, with really smart people on a really interesting problem.<p>So am I getting a bad deal or am I over thinking this? Badly need some advice.<p>UPDATE1:
Should highlight the fact that after six months, they plan to pay my lost wages subject to the availability of capital.<p>Market Rate: y
FIRST SIX MONTHS SALARY: x
NEXT SIX MONTHS SALARY: y+ (y-x) + z
AFTER ONE YEAR SALARY: y + z<p>z being equal to a measure of the risk I am taking<p>My opinion of the co founders is that they are really smart and honest people.<p>UPDATE2 :
Just got a call from one of the co-founders. He has very kindly explained to me that the deal they have offered me is taking into consideration the fact that any equity I have will be enforceable in U.S. Their idea of this structure is a cash payout in lieu of an equity.",1315036521

If I send someone 1 visitor I need to get back 2 visitors, the people that send me those 2 visitors will need to get back 4, for those 4 visitors sent we need 8 visitors sent back to the sites that sent us 4, and 16 visitors to make up for the 8 we just received and so on and so on.

Almost like a... ""Visit / Discover sites similar to this one"" which has links that send my visitors to other websites that have the same ""topic"" as mine. Other participating sites similar to mine have the widget as well and visitors from there can discover my site.<p>How is it possible, without being a ponzi/pyramid scheme, that every time a user clicks on one of the links on the widget on my site, you're going to send 2 visitors back to mine? That would mean on the other sites' widgets you'd have to display a link to my site until 2 visitors click through to it so I can get my 2 visitors. That means the links on the widgets will need to change so that those 2 sites get 4 visitors sent back to them, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.... What if I send through 15 visitors, how on earth am I going to get 30 visitors back then the sites that sent me those 30 visitors get 60 visitors back then the sites that sent those 60 visitors get 120 visitors back, then 240, then 480, 960, 1,920, 3,840.

The venture and startup ecosystem isn't as developed here, and frankly I don't think you'd get anyhwere without a businessplan and a powerpoint deck.<p>Businessplans are great for getting funding from people who don't really understand your business, are government employees, banks, or are looking for the safety of knowing you are an expert in your field. They're also great for making an appearance and looking ""professional"". For instance when I hand out businessplans they're always pesonalised (every page will be annotated with ""private and confidential - this businessplan belongs to Joe Schmuck). People fall for this.<p>It's basically a great sales document for people that don't know much about startups. If you live in an area where nobody knows what the heck you're talking about when you mention retention rates, A/B split tests, etc. these are the tricks you'll need to get funding.<p>I've always included ""we will produce (product) to enhance shareholder value"" in all the businessplans I've written just to see if anyone would catch the Neal Stehpenson reference.

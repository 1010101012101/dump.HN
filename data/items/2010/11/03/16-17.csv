1865454,comment,1865099,1865360,0,0,kenjackson,,,"Interesting, as historically the problem has been quite the opposite.  If you go back not that far most devs simply had a flat position in the org.  There were no Distiguished Engineers or even Architect titles.  You were a programmer.<p>Of course people started to get upset because the only way they could advance in the company was to go into management.  A corporate VP can make $250k/year but a programmer never could.  Maybe if you single handedly implemented Google you'd get a $50k bonus that year, but your base salary is still $80k/year.  And maybe you get a 15% pay raise for your great contribution.<p>And when everyone is a ""programmer"" it is more apparent than even now that everyone is a replaceable cog.<p>It sounds like the Google promotion system is just bad.  Since technical ladders don't have human resource bottlenecks (you can't make everyone the dev manager, but you can promote everyone to Level 4 SWE) you really should have very clear guidelines as to what constitutes a promotion.<p>When I've managed it looks like this:\n""This is where you're at today.  To get to the next level, this is what you need to do.  With your help we've put together this plan for your next 3-6 months.  You'll finish up A, make sure B gets deployed.  C gets checked-in with QA sign off.  Do this w/o ticking anyone off or being a general jerk and that looks like Level XYZ"".<p>Every week we talk about his/her progress against the plan.  There's no pleasant surprises, but there's also no big disappointment.  If you're not getting a promotion we've known about it for a while, and we're usually both not happy because I've made it clear that something is not going well.<p>Notice, there's no competition against other employees or any other such race.  With that said, there are cases where there is little or no money associated with the promotion, but surprisingly this is often not a concern.",1288803548

There are many cases, especially after 2-3 levels of indentation, where 80 characters is an unreasonably narrow space.  I don't have a strong preference for reading code within 80 characters.  And I'd much rather comments use 80 characters plus indentation rather than worry about whether I've got my screens vertically split.<p>> Furthermore having 80 chars is great to have vertically split editors with the code on one panel and the tests or the documentation on the other panel.<p>Having lines here or there that go beyond 80 characters doesn't completely prevent you from doing this, and having an entire statement on a single line of code makes line-based tools like grep or kill-line more effective.<p>Limiting to 80 characters is a good idea, but it's easy to see that there are a few significant tradeoffs, and that someone trying to get something done is not going to want to bother.",1288802866

Unfortunately, these are mostly not bugs but bad design that is believed to be correct by the core developers, so it is unlikely to ever change:<p>- Matrices are a pain. The r_[] and c_[] operators could be a reasonable replacement for Matlab's elegant matrix construction syntax, but they do not work as expected (as smart hstack and vstack), instead doing something completely different and inconsistent for vectors and matrices.<p>- Tensors are a bigger pain. Matlab has a very well-defined semantics for operations like permute and reshape; in NumPy these operations sometimes create just a view, at other times they reshuffle the memory contents. I know the idea was to ""protect"" the user from having to know the memory layout of data, but this idea is bad.<p>- Ipython is great in every way except when it comes to reloading parts of your program. After any tiny change to your code, the only safe thing to do is to quit ipython and start it again.

What characteristics would it have?<p>- No pleasant surprises. In other words, you can only be disappointed if you didn't get a promotion, you can't be pleasantly surprised by a promotion.<p>- Create unhappiness by dependence on scarce resources. In other words, gate promotions based on scarce resources so that even people who would otherwise be qualified could become disgruntled through no fault of their own.<p>-Eliminate accountability from people who make the promotion decisions (e.g., through a committee). That way, promotion decisions can seem arbitrary.<p>-Ensure that promotions are competitive races between all qualified candidates. This ensures that people who manipulate that packet in such a way as to have the best looking packets will win over people who are trying to get feedback and improve, which is supposedly the point behind all these feedback systems.<p>When I looked at Google's promotion system through this lens, I was very impressed. It seemed as though the system was designed to create disgruntled employees out of people who might otherwise be perfectly happy. And note that the ex-Googlers I interviewed were people who benefited from the system, as in: they were very well respected and were hence ranked highly. They were people who couldn't care less what their ranking was, yet they disliked the system anyway, purely because they thought that having a ranking system actually had a deleterious effect on the exchange of ideas.""<p>There is a follow up post (<a href=""http://piaw.blogspot.com/2010/05/promotion-systems-redux.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://piaw.blogspot.com/2010/05/promotion-systems-redux.htm...</a>)<p>A snippet<p>""My spies at Google tell me that my essay on promotion systems drew a reaction on a Google mailing list that I didn't read even back when I was employed at Google.<p>I did get a few interesting responses. I won't post them here, but I'll address what a few points:<p>Someone.....pointed out that the real compensation at Google was much more dependent on raises, stock and bonuses, so the promotion system didn't matter. But that's not true at all! First of all, there was a level-based salary cap, and people did hit them. So at some point, you have to get promoted if you want your salary to keep going up. Bonuses were based on salaries, so those don't go up if your salary doesn't go up. Secondly, even if it was true that options and bonuses was all that mattered, then you just validated the claim that eliminating the engineering ladder wouldn't hurt productivity at all!""<p>I've found Piaw's posts to be very worth reading, even if you don't end up agreeing with him.

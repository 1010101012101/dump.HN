108277,comment,107683,107841,0,0,airhadoken,,,"You are the first person I've ever heard to pronounce < as ""ascending"".  Really, gt/lt functions are my biggest tripover point when doing prefix-everything expressions, because they work in the opposite way of how we were taught as children to interpret them.  a<b is true if b is greater than a, and we can evaluate it <i>visually</i> by looking at the expanded side of the operator versus the pinched side of the operator (the former being greater than the latter iff true).  In (< a b), the expanded side is pointing at exactly the element which it does not represent, meaning that we can't use those nice optimized mental pathways which are devoted to visually evaluating the expression.<p>It's logically consistent with how the rest of the system works, but it sucks because having to unlearn anything sucks.  Personally, I just imagine it being rewritten as infix.",1201937432

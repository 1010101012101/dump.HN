Unless the products or sites are highly different from each other (Ex one from health care industry and other one from entertainment) you do not need to set up multiple corporations. So it is a bad idea. Think about tax implications and paperwork involved.Try to run a single entity and you will know how much work does it involve.<p>There are lot of media outlets out there with several sites, magazines or product but with just one corporation.<p>P.S- This is not a legal or professional advice.

Civil union should get every current private and government benefit of marriage.  Strictly religious benefits from private entities could potentially be withdrawn from civil unions (I honestly have no idea what those would be).",1358218764

This is not so dis-similar to television shows that are chock-full of product placement, but I think that this goes even a bit further than that. This would be content that has no value at all, except for selling a certain brand beer, parading itself as a television show, dressed in the corporate logo. That is what this is, content of no value, parading itself in the Atlantic brand.<p>I don't appreciate this.

There's a vast gulf between aaronsw asking for help with the costs of a predictable, if improbable, legal defense that several people (including myself) felt he brought upon himself, and the implicit (via hindsight) suggestion that aaronsw was asking for the help needed to stave off suicidal behavior.<p>I think it's most unfair to conflate a person's legal and psychological problems as this headline does, and equally unfair to single out a contemporary critical comment from a HN participant as if that participant's skepticism about the merits of Aaronsw's hacktivism were made with an understanding of his psychological fragility. Both the original comment and this story make the mistake of assuming the worst about their subject, but there's a wide qualitative difference between peer-peer commentary on a message board and pseudo-objective commentary on a commercial news site.<p>As someone with a few suicidal episodes of my own, I can easily see how the stress of Aaronsw's socio-legal situation could have been a contributing factor to his suicide. However, the suicidal impulse is very often an irrational one and attempting to analyze it rationally often misses the mark completely and ends with projecting one's own views onto the dead person - doubly so where the stressors are political rather than personal and the person's death is widely viewed as an episode of martyrdom.<p>People are not machines, and policy issues (administrative, legislative and judicial) do not operate in mechanistic fashion. It would be a more tractable and perhaps even a better world if people were as clear and consistent as computers, but they're not.

If we overthrew the government for a plausible movement to create a scarcity-free utopia, we still most likely wouldn't end up with such - the kind of people who seize the reins of power don't sit idly by just because we're hopeful. And correct me if I'm wrong, but this is the major reason you're having an allergic reaction to what I'm saying.<p>But don't worry, democracies usually aren't overthrown. And this one, being ultimately ruled by capital, certainly won't be. But it still is dying, and may even get there in our lifetimes. In the worst case, it will face this long period of decline followed by ultimate economic and thus societal collapse. This process will not be pretty, and we can only hope that whomever fills the resulting power vacuum isn't preaching a message of a scarcity-free utopia, if you know what I mean.<p>The better outcome is one in which this failing husk of a nation is used to incubate (and is slowly replaced by) more agile and sustainable methods of societal interaction and coordination - based on voluntary interactions on the Internet. For rough examples, we can look at the positive ideas of cryptoanarchism for example implementations of various things (and please note that these technologies evidently play out much differently than was forseen). We don't need a ""first amendment"" and constant struggles to define a uniform meaning of freedom of expression for 300M people. We can codify the first pass of this concept by running TOR, and let much smaller autonomous groups use the resulting environment as a starting point for refinements appropriate to their community. Likewise with economic policy and many other issues that are currently centrally and unaccountably dictated by Uncle Sam. There's obviously a whole host of things I'm not or am unable to address, and focusing on any particular philosophy/technology is missing the larger picture (which is why I avoid doing so).

Comparable to the SunOS workstation I was using at the time in tools.<p>Eventually discovering Debian and what real package management could buy for you really sealed the deal.  I've continued to have tangential exposure to Windows over the years, but it's always been a hugely frustrating, complicated, inconsistent mess to deal with.",1358217853

5058263,comment,5030803,5048457,1,0,jrapdx,,,"As presented, the example macro doesn't demonstrate referential transparency, but then again, the example appears to be incorrect.<p>The issue is invoking ""(swapargs (mod 7 5))"".  I tried this in the Scheme REPL (Chicken to be precise), in which the macro was defined:<p><pre><code>  (define-syntax swapargs
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((_ ls) (list (list-ref ls 0) (list-ref ls 2)
                    (list-ref ls 1)))))

  (swapargs '(a b c)) => (a c b)
  (swapargs (swapargs '(a b c))) => (a b c)
</code></pre>
In other words, the macro does show referential transparency.<p>However, the following doesn't work:<p><pre><code>  (swapargs (modulo 7 5)) => Error: (list-tail) bad   
                             argument type: 2
</code></pre>
The problem is the argument is evaluated first, and ""2"" is not a list.  (The macro requires a list-of-3 argument.)<p><pre><code>  (modulo 7 5) => 2
</code></pre>
Probably, what was intended was like this:<p><pre><code>  (swapargs '(module 7 5)) => (modulo 5 7)
</code></pre>
And again:<p><pre><code>  (swapargs (swapargs '(module 7 5))) => (module 7 5)
  (eval (swapargs '(module 7 5))) => 5
  (eval (swapargs (swapargs '(module 7 5)))) => 2
  (eval (swapargs (swapargs '(module 10 8)))) => 2
</code></pre>
It looks like confusion between literal and evaluable lists prompted the wrong conclusion, but in this case it's simple to rectify.<p>Of course, macros in Scheme/Lisp can easily become convoluted and bug-ridden as much as any code, even aside from arguments about the virtues of ""hygienic"" vs. ""unhygienic"" systems.  Properly constructed, macros remain an essential feature of Lisp/Scheme languages.<p>BTW, if we're comparing qualities of programming languages, here's a real-life example showing the particular merit of Scheme.  I took on the task of creating a complex application (a web server supporting multiple hosts) and decided to write it primarily in Scheme (and some C).  The first version was up and running in less than half a year.<p>Inevitably, months after the project was deployed changes were necessary.  Despite the length of time since last seen, the code wasn't obscure to me, it was easy to understand and pick up where I'd left off before.  Definitely different from prior experiences.<p>The crux is getting a good grasp on its core, macrology perhaps among the harder parts.  But understood, Scheme allows enhanced productivity, as I've known it more so than other languages ""under load"" in parallel situations.",1358217816

We don't have songs of solidarity any more.  Instead it's months of indictments and pre-trial proceedings and motions and legal fees, all over things we didn't even see happen in the first place, in a snarky community that will tear people down at least 50% of the time.  I can't really think of a less effective resistance strategy.<p>It's also mostly fueled by indifference and self-interest, not activism.  Most file sharers just don't care that they are breaking the law; they want to do what they want to do.  If these laws are to ever change we're going to need to start downloading and sharing on the Capital Steps, or get arrested for printing free books for poor kids.  We are going to need to be prepared to go to jail ahead of time, before they decide to come after us.  That way people like Aaron who don't have the support network and preparation aren't the only ones facing this.<p>Unfortunately, in my experience the existing activist networks are not the place to start.  The anarchists just want to relive the 70's, labor is watching their power dwindle and is focused myopically on the little that remains, poverty campaigners are burned out from fighting years of losing battles and the Occupy, anti-globalization and professional activists seem perfectly happy to march just to be doing anything at all.  Many people can agree on the problems, but few people can agree on the solutions (much less small, concrete steps to get there) and so they don't accomplish anything.

But just as often, I seek out long-form, descriptive pieces to learn what reliable people believe is true. I cannot validate every aspect of the outside world, so I trust others to do this. When they are frequently right, like Nate Silver, say, I trust them more. When they lend their brand to more bizarre groups, I trust them less, not because the sponsored link itself changes the truth of the rest of the articles, but because it signals a lack of judgment that might have a common source with many other important and difficult decisions a magazine or newspaper must make.<p>For instance, when I read the Economist, I feel rather confident in their facts.

Hopefully you're just going for a dramatic point of view to drive responses, but as a point of professional courtesy, that's ok in your lead, not your actual content.<p>1. AB is not about determining the effect of various factors in isolation.  Its about quickly reaching a solution that is close to optimal in situations where you can't feasibly generate the kind of data you'd need to build a model.<p>2.  AB is not poorly suited to dealing with ""externalities,"" confounding variables, etc.  It is the only method that is suited to dealing with them.<p>3.  This does happen, but it is more of a failure in the selection of WHAT to test, than it is a failure of the methodology itself.  An understanding of optimization strategies is helpful in avoiding this trap.  In practice I think what most people are doing is closer to simulated annealing than greedy anyway.<p>Ping me @TC_Davis on twitter if you want pointers to resources on any of the above.",1358215956

It is how we keep our software up-to-date.<p>How about the flip side:  how would you like to have no code ever erased -- how would you like to spend your time supporting code written 50 years ago side-by-side with code written yesterday?  That is what our legal system is like right now:  laws that made sense decades ago, laws that made no sense decades ago, laws that were passed this year, etc., all relevant and applicable today.  The government cannot even count the number of laws on the books at this point.<p>""Explicit handling of corner cases""<p>How about not bothering with corner cases?  Let people whose actions seem criminal but which do not meet the definition of any crime go free.  Do we really need to prosecute every single person who does something we do not like?<p>Our justice system is <i>supposed</i> to favor innocence, not guilt.  Yet we see the exact opposite happen with the ""let's make sure we never have corner cases by being as broad as we can be"" approach to law.<p>The point is for laws to have a clear boundary between innocence and guilty.  <i>Nobody should be unsure about whether or not they are breaking the law</i> and we should not be relying on a handful of judges to make such determinations.<p>""""Reasonable Person"" codified explicitly would take pages and pages and pages.""<p>Sounds like the real problem here is that we have laws based on what ""reasonable people"" do, which is a pretty conservative approach to law.  Why should the law be concerned with ""reasonable people"" -- why shouldn't the law just clearly state which actions are illegal and which are not?<p>We seem to be pretty straightforward sometimes.  We define BAC limits for DUI laws.  Why not be straightforward about computer crime too?  Why not be straightforward about all laws?  You are right, most people cannot understand pages and pages of laws -- so what are we supposed to do with the current legal system?  You walk down the street at the mercy of the policy, because in reality you have no idea which laws you might have broken or which laws you were expected to follow.<p>What would a reasonable person do?  A reasonable person would get a job, climb the social ladder, and never complain about it.  Reasonable people in the 19th century would not have complained about women not having the right to vote.  Reasonable people in the 18th century would not have complained about the triangle trade or slavery in general.  Reasonable people would not have rebelled against British rule, nor written the Magna Carta.  Laws should not be based on what reasonable people would or would not do; laws should be based on ensuring that people can continue to enjoy their freedom.<p>""What does that have to do with this line of discussion?""<p>I suppose that last comment was only tangentially related.  The combination of broad laws, powerful prosecutors, and plea bargaining are the reason America is the world leader in imprisonment.  Most of our prisoners never received a trial, because they odds were so severely stacked against them that they just accepted the plea bargain on the advice of their lawyers (often overworked public defenders).

He was wrong because his mental model of how federal cases work was wrong.<p>He, much like my self, probably assumed that someone with millions of dollars could fund the litigation of a federal case, however, the nature of these prosecutions tend to freeze assets, alienate friends and business partners who could help fund a defense and generally make it impossible for justice to be done. I would have been wrong about this too.<p>We all get stuff wrong from time to time, and to be honest, I'm not sure where the line should be drawn. However, I firmly believe edw519's comments come from a place of experience, love, and support even if it might not be what we always want to hear.<p>My hope is that my comments when based in love and charity would not be subject to similar comments that edw519's comments have been. It's okay to disagree and edw519 might even disagree in someways with what he wrote.",1358215248

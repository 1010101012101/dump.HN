Akka is trying to solve some of those problems of course :)<p>And of course the lack of tools. It's hard for me to talk about this because I loathe IDEs.

I have a dashboard that lets me see in realtime how many check-ins are occurring and where (and I can filter by distance and venue type). I can set thresholds (I'll pay $1 to get any customer in the door, I'll pay $20 to get a group of 4 in the door, etc) OR let an algorithm determine the spot value of getting a customer in the door. My dashboard then automatically generates the appropriate deal. When my other threshold (current capacity/throughput in my venue) is reached, the deal expires. (Of course, I can see how someone who had to wait a long time for a cab might be burned if the deal expires before she arrives - there must be a way around that).<p>Right now, the issue I'm having is - how do people get notified about the deal? If it's in-game and I get a partnership w 4sq, it's a little easier...but it's still irritating to be ""pitched to"" every time I'm out on the town. If I sign up to a third-party system riding on top of 4sq, it takes me out of the awesome game-mindset that 4sq engenders.

Not trying to knock starting your own company, but it's just not economically pheasible (sp?) for a lot of kids comming out of school with debt or zero dollars.<p>I'd say if you're a brilliant engineer or uber creative self starter since you where young, then yes go for it. But lets face it, most of us aren't, moreover, most of us (myself included) are fucking retards despite 3.8 GPA's and what have you comming out of school. I didn't realize how clueless I was until I started banking, that's just me.<p>For me, I figured if I started a company out of school I'd likely spin my wheels for 2.5 years with a probable outcome of a failed knock of some stupid social site. Go look at TechStars track record of their incubated companies, ~75 companies funded 2 acquisitions and ~<30-40% unfunded. I think VC's and TechCrunchers are too fucking high and mighty, and def sluff off the downsides of starting a company/very quick to knock any other post grad job that isn't starting your own company.<p>I took a class my last semester at college via our law school and it was taught by a really prominent startup attorney and venture capitalist. Really opened my eyes as to the business of VC and start up companies. They paint a picture that VC and entrepreneurship is some big benevolent crusade. It's not, it's a business like any other and VC's know this full well. Also, a ton of kids in the class where all amped up on starting their own company, but during candid conversations disclosed they just wanted to start a company as a path to become a VC. Fucking bullshit. You know who's going to be a VC? People who are really fucking good at making making money or have a shit tone of money (Ashton Kutcher anyone?) not some broke dumb fuck law grad who started OodleMyDoodle.com and only noteworthy exit was folding up 3 failed startups (harsh, but it happens, 10x more than not). Starting a business isn't a fucking joke, not a loveable loser Disney movie, I've seen plenty of extremely talented comp sci grads and startup junkies go absolutely nowhere with really cool biz plans. VC's and entrepreneurs my give off the aura of being care free and fully satisfied with life but just from personally knowing very sucessful individuals in both arenas can see that they're just fucking cold blooded and money hungry as your Dbag hitter MD at XX ibank.<p>A good time start a company in my opinion is when you know your potential companies space inside and out, i.e. how you can make it work (at least on paper) financially, not only where to get the money for it but 3-4 niche investors that you could call up personally that would seriously consider your exec sum after a 20 min phone call/email, a specific targeted potential clientel universe, a detailed results driven/substantiated internal biz plan/""road-map"", and a realistic liquidity event at 5-10 years.

2683734,comment,2683421,2683421,1,0,aspir,,,"I'm a contracted business plan and grant writer on the side as I work at a startup. I've also entered and placed in / won a few national biz plan competitions in multiple industries (biotech, pharma, semicon, ren. energy, B2C software, B2B software) so I feel like I may be able to gauge this.<p>Odds are strong that your plan, if in the consumer space, is already outdated. Unless you have real, long-lasting IP (not just 'patent pending', but literally a process that is revolutionary and incredibly hard to reverse engineer, typical with university tech) the market has likely shifted away from your assumptions. Unless this is true, the business plan is only worth the paper and ink it's printed on.<p>That said, if you have been able to secure the first partnership, funding, or start carrying out the actual plan, you have something much more valuable than 30 bound pages and a spreadsheet. That deserves equity, and a lot of it.<p>Also, and I apologize if this sounds rude, 2 years of writing a biz plan is about 15-18 months too long. I can bang out a complete draft sans graphics in ~4 weekends. Any more time that that, and I get into the ""law of diminishing returns"" space. Whatever you do, don't rewrite it -- you've already sunk enough time into it. Fundraise full time, line up partners, presell the product with your next time period, but another day tweaking that plan is another day lost.<p>For the record -- I'm not a fan of writing business plans at all, but it pays the bills, and organizations are happy to write me big checks so they don't have to write them either. Some big industries require them (bio, semicon, green energy), but those same players also want ironclad IP, so its a completely different world than the modern web space.",1308758694

What you should do if you still want access to Accountview is to trap a variable with a reference to it in the closure.  Using your jquery example:<p><pre><code>  AccountView.prototype.render = function() {\n    $("".account"").click( { that: this }, function(e) {\n      // 'that' now holds a reference to AccountView\n    });\n  };\n</code></pre>\nIf you don't want to use (or you are using an older version of jquery without the eventData) you could use a closure:<p><pre><code>  $("".account"").click( (function(that) {\n    return function(e) {\n      // 'that' now holds a reference to AccountView\n    })(this);\n  });</code></pre>",1308758676

I don't think either of them fully understood the amount of mental stimulation and learning that computers can provide. I was able to teach myself C in high school; this provided me with an advantage to other students in University in the introductory programming classes.<p>They never had any problem if I chose to watch TV socially instead of spend time alone. However, I rarely watch TV simply due to the lack of stimulation and interaction, not to mention the amount of garbage that is broadcast these days, unless it is in a social environment.<p>I have tried in the past to convince them of the benefits of what I am doing, but they simply refuse to acknowledge ""computer time"" as independent educational exercise.",1308758492

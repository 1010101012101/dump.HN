As someone who always had enough to get by, but never enough to spend without consequence, the goal of ""being successful and having money"" was always one I sought to obtain. While younger I always assumed all my problems would be solved by such a venture. I've learned that will never be the case on my own, but the concerns the wealthy state are interestingly complex - much more so than the standard concerns of a middle-income family/person.

2365365,comment,2364038,2364379,0,0,Dove,,,"Methodology varies with the terrain.  Studies of human genetics are limited to observation, as experimentation is unethical.  Studies of history -- archeology, evolution -- don't have a lot going on in the repeatability department.  Studies on topics of opinion -- advertising effectiveness, political surveys -- necessarily contend with a host of sampling biases and confounding variables.<p>Not everything is physics.  And I don't think it's intellectually optimal to flag everything that <i>can't</i> be  physics as simple nonsense.<p>I'd rather acknowledge and talk about methodological weaknesses when we discuss how persuasive the experiment is.  I mean, it's not like an experiment that does everything ""right"" is always perfectly persuasive either.  Reality is complicated; sometimes you were asking the wrong question.  Most things are neither ironclad nor nonsense, but fall somewhere in the middle.<p>So, two things about subjective measurement.  First, just because something's subjective doesn't mean it's totally unreliable.  You can fool yourself about small things; large things are harder.  Suppose you're trying to demonstrate the presence of a material by the color of a flame.  If you're trying to distinguish between pale green and pale pale green, better break out the spectrometer.  But calling whether it's yellow or blue?  Qualia will suffice.<p>Applied to this case, I think I would rely on someone to be able to answer the question, ""Are you well-rested or not?"" with a ""yes"", ""no"", or ""sorta"".  On the other hand, a 99 vs a 98 percent measurement -- as done here -- is pretty darn iffy.<p>The second thing about subjective measurements is that, when you're after subjective results, that's the right sort of measure.  For example, if someone says, ""When I spend time with friends, I feel like I do better on math tests the next day,"" you might rightly respond, ""We should be measuring the scores, not your feelings.  It's possible your friends are making you feel competent when you really aren't.""  But if someone says, ""When I spend time with friends, I feel happier,"" does it even make sense to say, ""It's possible your friends are making you feel happier when you really aren't?""  The best you can do is try to define degrees of happiness and measure statistically.<p>When the feeling is the object of the discussion, the subjective isn't an illusion.  A pill which makes you feel competent when you aren't is producing an illusion, but a pill that makes you feel happy when you want to is a pill that <i>works</i>.<p>(This likewise reduces the point of blinding.  If we're trying to figure out whether a chemical makes you happy, it makes sense to run it against a placebo.  But if we're trying to figure out whether an activity makes you happy, being aware that you did it is appropriate.  Whether it's the physical motion or the awareness that makes you happy is immaterial to whether the activity works.)<p>All of that is to say, if the guy is trying to prove he is well-rested in the sense that he performs better, he reacts more quickly, his judgement is more sound, all the various things we associate with being well-rested, he should be taking tests.  But if he is trying to <i>feel</i> well-rested, he should be asking, ""How well-rested do I feel?""<p>Now, it's hard to say exactly which he's after -- feeling well-rested but possibly performing like crap, or feeling like crap but possibly performing well.  I'd think he probably wants both things.  I certainly would. So I think he's only measuring half of what he should.  The result could certainly be made more complete by doing something like the coffee guy did (<a href=""http://quantifiedself.com/2009/10/the-false-god-of-coffee/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quantifiedself.com/2009/10/the-false-god-of-coffee/</a>).<p>It is promising that he measured how long he slept before first waking up -- that's pretty objective -- but I can't tell exactly what he's saying he did.  (I can't tell what he means by baseline(3) and random(3), so I can't really critique the results).<p>It would be nice if he'd chosen the exercise randomly for the random portion of the experiment.  By just picking one, there's a serious possibility he was picking based on how tired he already felt due to events of the day (it is exercise he's signing up for, after all.)  I don't know that it reduces those results to nonsense, but it certainly does reduce them to <i>possibly</i> nonsense.  I think the best you can get is, ""Huh, that's interesting enough to investigate--do it again, and use a die this time.""<p>And then we have the obvious criticism: he only tried it on himself.  Whether it works <i>only</i> on him for psychological reasons relating to his life history, or whether it only works on some people for genetic reasons, or what . . . remains to be seen.<p>On the whole, I'd give it about a five out of ten for methodology.  I do like that he tried the exercise over a period of months, kept notes, and looked for patterns.  That's worth a lot of credit right there.  I think it could be improved by stating more clearly what he's trying to prove, by incorporating objective measurements where possible and keeping subjective measurements as clear-cut as possible -- though that sort of thing is really more appropriate for the next iteration, anyway.  There's investigating to find interesting patterns, and then there's setting out to demonstrate the truth of what you think you've found.  An investigative experiment -- which this certainly was -- is inherently not going to be a demonstrative one.<p>I wouldn't mind clearer labeling of the charts, and I definitely wouldn't mind access to the raw data.  That would bolster the case a lot.<p>And a repeat would be great -- someone else should try it and see if it works.  Ideally several people.<p>Overall, though, it's far from nonsense, and I certainly wouldn't put it in the ""trying to get people to stand on one leg to make a point about how gullible we are when we see graphs"" category.  I'd mark it investigative/interesting.",1300992712

2365297,comment,2356735,2362428,0,0,Sesse_,,,"Hi,<p>I work at Google, and I've been working on the Snappy open-sourcing. First of all, let me state that when doing our benchmarks, we were definitely comparing against the latest public version (1.5.0) of QuickLZ. I'm having problems reproducing your benchmark results; could you provide some more details about the exact settings, compiler version, architecture etc.? I can't even get all of the compression ratios to match up exactly with the ones I'm seeing, so there must be some sort of difference between the setups. Are you perchance running Snappy with assertions enabled? (The microbenchmark will complain if you do, so it's easy to check.)<p>For what it's worth, I ran the QuickLZ test suite on my own machine (you can see the exact testing environment below), and got quite different results:<p><pre><code>  qlz-testsuite/flower.bmp                 :\n  QUICKLZ: [b 1M] bytes 5922816 -> 5087471 85.9%  comp 132.4 MB/s  uncomp 140.8 MB/s\n  SNAPPY: [b 4M] bytes 5922816 -> 5369439 90.7%  comp 180.6 MB/s  uncomp 484.0 MB/s\n  qlz-testsuite/gdb.exe                    :\n  QUICKLZ: [b 1M] bytes 8872609 -> 4074990 45.9%  comp 177.4 MB/s  uncomp 213.3 MB/s\n  SNAPPY: [b 4M] bytes 8872609 -> 4530851 51.1%  comp 224.7 MB/s  uncomp 468.7 MB/s\n  qlz-testsuite/northwind.mdf              :\n  QUICKLZ: [b 1M] bytes 2752512 -> 628607 22.8%  comp 291.3 MB/s  uncomp 409.6 MB/s\n  SNAPPY: [b 4M] bytes 2752512 -> 726437 26.4%  comp 456.6 MB/s  uncomp 790.1 MB/s\n  qlz-testsuite/plaintext.txt              :\n  QUICKLZ: [b 1M] bytes 2899483 -> 1436466 49.5%  comp 155.4 MB/s  uncomp 182.7 MB/s\n  SNAPPY: [b 4M] bytes 2899483 -> 1629408 56.2%  comp 195.2 MB/s  uncomp 487.5 MB/s\n  qlz-testsuite/proteins.txt               :\n  QUICKLZ: [b 1M] bytes 7254685 -> 2600129 35.8%  comp 218.2 MB/s  uncomp 261.2 MB/s\n  SNAPPY: [b 4M] bytes 7254685 -> 2934406 40.4%  comp 269.4 MB/s  uncomp 556.9 MB/s\n\n  Average compression ratio (geometric mean, lower is better): QuickLZ 43.7%, Snappy 48.9%.\n  Average compression speed (harmonic mean): QuickLZ 180.9 MB/s, Snappy 238.0 MB/s.\n  Average decompresion speed (harmonic mean): QuickLZ 212.5 MB/s, Snappy 536.9 MB/s.\n</code></pre>\nIn addition, there's one nearly-incompressible file listed on the same page, which I also ran on (it's not included in the averages above):<p><pre><code>  qlz-testsuite/NotTheMusic.mp4            :\n  QUICKLZ: [b 1M] bytes 9832475 -> 9832565 100.0%  comp 289.3 MB/s  uncomp 2815.9 MB/s\n  SNAPPY: [b 4M] bytes 9832475 -> 9485433 96.5%  comp 1308.4 MB/s  uncomp 2477.1 MB/s\n</code></pre>\nThis is on a Nehalem 2.27GHz, running Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 in 64-bit mode, GCC version 4.4.5, with flags -O2 -g -DNDEBUG for both Snappy (1.0.0) and QuickLZ (1.5.0), running snappy_unittest to compare. QuickLZ was left at the default settings, ie. the files were exactly as downloaded from <a href=""http://www.quicklz.com/quicklz.[ch]"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quicklz.com/quicklz.[ch]</a> as of today. In\nparticular, this means QuickLZ was running in unsafe mode, which means it could crash on corrupted compressed input. (Safe mode, which is comparable to how Snappy runs, is, according to <a href=""http://www.quicklz.com/download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quicklz.com/download.html</a>, 15–20% slower at decompression, so the difference would be bigger.)<p>Exact benchmark results will, as always, vary with differing compiler, set of flags, CPU, and data set. The average numbers from this benchmark, however, show QuickLZ 1.5.0 (in unsafe mode) compressing about 11% more densely than Snappy 1.0.0 does, but Snappy compressing about 32% faster and decompressing about 153% faster (ie., about 2.53 times as fast).<p>/* Steinar */",1300991655

I suspect that if you are an entrepreneur 'to get rich' and you succeed and find you are depressed all the time because you don't know who your friends are, some (possibly material) portion of your new found wealth will go toward counseling.<p>I had the non-unique experience of being a multi-millionaire for 2 weeks in the summer of 1999. Which is to say that on paper, in terms of options and restricted stock, and stock which was currently owned but embargoed (due to my companies acquisition) was 'worth' millions.<p>I really had to sit back and think hard about what that meant, would I retire in 4 years?, keep working ? join a venture firm? The stock went from $120/share to $0.83/share before I could sell any of it so I never had to actually answer those questions but I found that how I felt when I was 'rich' was different than how I thought I would feel. I don't know if that is a common experience or not.<p>I find the idea that someone wouldn't really feel financially secure unless they had $1b in the bank sad. But I looked at what Google paid for Eric Schmidt's 'security detail' and I realized that at some point you become a 'soft target' for people who would acquire money through violence or extortion. I would hope to avoid becoming one of those targets. I've heard that if you are ever in danger of acquiring too much wealth you can 'fix' that by buying an airline.

Instead of finding out how stuff works, this particular philosophy prescribes just deciding how it should work and then believing this arbitrary decision to accurately reflect the nature of the universe.</i><p>Okay, this is actually just you projecting your beliefs onto what spirituality means.  It is not <i>by definition</i> in any sense of the word.<p>> <i>It's inappropriate to tag cosmic processes with a concept that should be reserved for intelligent life forms.</i><p>How do you know the universe is not an intelligent life form?<p>> <i>It's this fallacy which brought us a movement that explores ""alternate theories"" in biology class. Religion is not science. ""Making stuff up"" that is unsupportable by evidence is not science.</i><p><i>Sigh</i> When did I say it was?  I explained clearly the difference between science and other forms of making stuff up, and you talked right past it.  It is as if you believe human beings are incapable of thinking in both scientific and unscientific ways.<p>> <i>Rejecting the whole stack of evidence and the hypotheses that came out of those observations in favor of something untestable and arbitrary does not seem like a viable strategy to understand the nature of the universe.</i><p>Who's rejecting anything?  Science does not tell us whether there is a god or not.<p>> <i>You call it atheistic hubris, I call it the growing impatience of rational people in the face of a world governed by fairy tales.</i><p>That's not what I call atheistic hubris.  What I call atheistic hubris is that the lack of recognizable evidence of higher consciousness is evidence that there is no higher consciousness.  The reason it is so hubristic is because we no idea what said evidence would look like.  Declaring this one way or the other is not scientific, it is instead I believe, a psychological need to have a firm order in one's knowledge of the universe.  I stand as evidence that this is not a pre-requisite for a true and healthy relationship with science.<p>> <i>I don't think our meatsacks are profane puppets in the service of an unseen force that floods the universe with artificial meaning. Instead I believe our ""meatsacks"" are marvelous, awesome machines and they gave rise to a form of consciousness that is unparalleled on this planet.</i><p>Why do you say puppet?  Trying to pigeonhole spiritual belief into some kind of biblical metaphor is exactly the attitude I'm fighting against.  I'm not saying that your mind is not governed  by chemical processes playing themselves out; I'm saying that even if that's 100% true (which is a very difficult truth to verify when you get down to the nuances), it doesn't mean there isn't something else going on on another level.  Perhaps the universe is conscious and you are just one small part of that, or perhaps there are parallel dimensions that get the information from our universe in some read-only fashion.  My point is not to arrive at the objective truth (how often do you arrive an objective unchanging truth in your interpersonal life?), but rather to leave myself open to bigger questions even if they remain unanswerable in any scientific capacity for the rest of time.",1300989766

But if singular itself was publicly exported by Dates, when you defined your own specializations of it in your module, they will go into the same multimethod that Dates is using. The big limitation here is that you can't <i>replace</i> the version that Dates has specialized on String by specializing on the same type.<p>The way this works is that when you import a multimethod from another module, you're importing the exact same multimethod object that that module is using.

2625603,comment,2624331,2625260,1,0,WorkingDead,,,"Both currency and 'intellectual property' only have value because they are backed by the government. Currency is very hard to reproduce without a substantial investment and has a lot less anonymity when being used. IP, on the other hand, can be redistributed in mass with a 5 year old computer you pull out of a dumpster almost completely anonymously. Piracy just isn't going to go away without public sympathy to the cause. Its like why everyone throws a fit when you violate an OSS license but actively encourages downloading a track from the latest pop artist. The public receives value from the one and has it extracted from them by the other. People are smart and can tell when they are getting screwed even if they cant sufficiently articulate how its being done.<p>In my opinion the only feasible way to fix the system is to bring copyright duration back to a reasonable time period, like  maybe 10 years or so, with a way to extend that duration for high value properties. One way would be to declare value on that particular property, paying property tax on that value, and limiting the liability of infringement damages to that declared value.<p>I'm not saying that piracy would go away totally at that point, but certainly more legitimate business models would emerge and even illegitimate ones would make the transition to reduce risk. Cost of enforcement would also go down as the volume of infringements decreased and those resources could be concentrated and directed along with a greater public support and sympathy. If the public can actually see that they get value out of protecting copyrights they will. If not they wont. I have zero incentive to protect the latest pop artists music if it will never go out of copyright in my life time, but if see that I can do whatever I want with it in 10 years, then yeah, I'd stick up for them and so would a lot of others.<p>The big label/studio/publisher companies dug themselves into this mess with a money grab and pretty much lost all sympathy from everyone that they cant buy off. Their only way out of this is to either be more open with their content or go back to fair laws. Other wise, the rest of us will go on without them. It also comes down to culture. Like it or not, music, movies, books, games, software, or whatever are our culture. You just cant reasonably expect people to not not have access to their culture forever. Its fair to have to pay for the latest and greatest, but as it is now, there is pretty much zero free access to anything since 1927 and that system just doesn't work. Now with technology, people just circumvent the unfair system like they should.",1307382534

This coffee shop is not located in the center of downtown, but rather sits nicely next to the ship canal in Ballard. The people who come through are very often locals and they value their ethics and reputations, thus return to pay back. A buddy of mine, who lives 30 minutes away, once forgot his wallet and had to pay $2.50 with the IOU. He returned a week later and payed back. This approach would never work in Manhattan, but Seattle folks are much friendlier and value small businesses over large chains.<p>In terms of baked goods, they weren't low quality, they were just home baked.

And it's obviously in the interest of the Scrum Alliance to make people believe that it matters because it lets them sell it over and over again to the Scrum Trainers. So it seems like they build their hierarchy to put themselves in a position where they profit from the lie that certification matters.<p>Moreover, they also added another couple of layers of people who also want people to believe that certification matters (Trainers and Masters because they want to make back the money they paid for their cert). While this is not exactly a pyramid scheme, there are some similarities in that money gets passed up and people are trying to convince everyone of a lie.<p>I think certifications might make sense for things where it is impossible for other people to tell whether someone knows their stuff.

Yellow Pages were/are huge. This is why people continue trying to get in. The problem is that unlike physical Yellow Pages, which have a regional monopoly, the barrier to entry is very low. This leads to fragmentation, and any single local business directory isn't very valuable. Combine with extremely spotty coverage and out of date listings, and online directories themselves are pretty useless. Even Google can't stay on top.<p>It gets worse because you have to cold-call small businesses to sell to them. New ones are always starting up and old ones are going out of business. They also don't want to pay very much money and suck at paying their bills.<p>Then there's the effort to drive traffic to the directories (or in some cases specific businesses listed in them) via AdWords or other advertising. This can work but is hard to pull off, most who try screw it up.<p>Don't forget that in addition to Google, Yelp etc. the Yellow Page companies themselves all have online directories, and massive existing sales forces and lists of customers.

Single Founder<p>Have you ever noticed how few successful startups were founded by just one person? Even companies you think of as having one founder, like Oracle, usually turn out to have more. It seems unlikely this is a coincidence.<p>What's wrong with having one founder? To start with, it's a vote of no confidence. It probably means the founder couldn't talk any of his friends into starting the company with him. That's pretty alarming, because his friends are the ones who know him best.<p>But even if the founder's friends were all wrong and the company is a good bet, he's still at a disadvantage. Starting a startup is too hard for one person. Even if you could do all the work yourself, you need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you out of stupid decisions, and to cheer you up when things go wrong.<p>The last one might be the most important. The low points in a startup are so low that few could bear them alone. When you have multiple founders, esprit de corps binds them together in a way that seems to violate conservation laws. Each thinks ""I can't let my friends down."" This is one of the most powerful forces in human nature, and it's missing when there's just one founder.",1307381279

I am not at all in pg's league as an influencer of online communities, but I've had a personal website with information and a point of view since 1995, and have been very active in online communities since before most members of the general public had ever heard of the Internet. (I started out on commercial online services.) Any online community allows an opportunity for a member to become conspicuous by contributing good content. Quite a few online communities are organized around an initial common interest everyone has (e.g., homeschooling or education reform or gifted education in the communities I'm most active in) and every community broadens its topic scope over time as people form friendships and share other interests.<p>Were I to set up a social news forum (presumably as a subpart of my personal website, to which I have devoted very little maintenance attention for years), I would announce that first to my 566 Facebook friends, most of whom I have met in online communities. (Many of them I have since ""face met"" at conferences around the country about the issues we all care about.) Many of them would be good moderators of a forum, and would be happy to help in return for finding new, good content and sharing that with a broader community of readers. I'll have to try the experiment, as soon as my busy technical adviser (my oldest son) squeezes some time together to upgrade my website.<p>P.S. Is there already a good site of this nature for news and discussion about education policy, or will I have to build my own? There is no sense in reinventing that wheel if a good wheel is already available.",1307380750

Pyramid schemes are necessarily unsustainable, because everyone who gets involved is solely relying on a windfall for getting still more people involved, and while the world is overbreeding, it's not at the rate they need. As soon as you find end users who will see some kind of net value even after growth stops, you have something that can sustain itself indefinitely. At worst it could be a bubble of investment in training capacity, if they overshot the market size.",1307379785

So give them something they want to read first, then make them communicate w/ each other. Or make sure the social network you want to create has value even if there's NOONE else in it.<p>You can also troll around in related forums and just start personal relationships with people. Start your own curated newsletter.<p>I also would recommend scraping fake posts from forums rather than coming up with your own. Put fake usernames, etc. Otherwise it ain't gonna be scalable.

There is advantage for silverlight in performance I believe but that is slowly changing now. because of browser competition.<p>Silverlight could have bought me if it was integrated in browser by default like Javascript/HTML. That seemed like logical step but they didn't do it for some reason (if im not mistakeing)",1307379682

I have no insider knowledge.<p>* On the server it will stay .NET.  I'll grant you that.<p>* On the client MS only supports HTML for the tile UI.  Launching any other apps opens it in the explorer shell.<p>* Why?  Windows doesn't believe in .NET.<p>* Why did MS push .NET on the client as recently as a couple of week ago?  Because MS is not a monolith.  Windows wants IE to be the rendering engine for Windows, while the dev tools group is pushing SL.<p>* Sinofsky is winning the internal battle.  He owns Windows and what Windows ships.  VS/CLR can ship new versions of the CLR, but they can't control what Sinofsky/Windows does.<p>* Ballmer doesn't have the internal power to face off against Sinofsky, but he can throttle STB.<p>* Everyone thought Muglia got ousted because of Cloud.  That was just a part of it.  It was because he didn't get inline with the HTML message.  He tried to cause a ruckus by getting the message out there, but was shutdown.  Everyone in STB now knows to keep their mouth shut.<p>* Guthrie was told that he's a shining star, but stars won't shine coming from SL.  Get over to Azure, and you're still on track for President.<p>* WP7 uses SL because IE wasn't ready.  The SL team took this as their chance to make a big impact and show that SL was indispensible and desired.  Good effort, but at the end didn't matter.  It will still be replaced.<p>* MS has no problem killing presentation layers.  They killed probably the most popular desktop layer of all time, VB6.  They killed WinForms.  They let MFC rot slowly with no replacement.  WPF was never given much chance to live.<p>* MS is thinking that iOS took off with Objective-C.  A more difficult langauge to learn and with no real dev base prior to 2008.  Windows feels that HTML is easier to learn and already has millions of devs.  If MS builds a great platform with lots of eyeballs, the devs will show up.",1307379681

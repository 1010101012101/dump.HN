1524146,comment,1523763,1523763,0,0,howard_yeh,,,"I like to maximize my windows, but that's because I spend 50% of dev time in Emacs. Some sort of split-screen is important for maximizing to work well. With Emacs, I never close my files. I choose between the files I want to switch to by typing the file name, and Emacs tries to find a match (sorted by recency). The effect is I can go to the files I need 90% of the time in under 3 key strokes. This is especially true for files I frequently need.<p>This is not to advocate Emacs (well, maybe it is pimping), but that an editor you can customize can be very helpful if you spend the time.<p>I use iTerm and Chrome. I put the most important tabs in the first 3 tabs, so i can cmd-{1,2,3} to access these tabs.<p>I use launchbar to switch between programs. I type ""Em"" => emacs, ""Ch"" => Chrome, ""it"" => iTerm, ""iTu"" => iTune. I turn off music when I need to focus.<p>I work both on my MacAir and my 27"" iMac, and the work follow is the same (not limited by screen size). I never found the need to have dual monitors.",1279385920

One of my favorite examples of this -- because it's just so ham-handed about it -- is a 1950 B movie called <i>Radar Secret Service</i>, as spoofed on <i>Mystery Science Theater 3000</i>:<p><a href=""http://mst3k.wikia.com/wiki/Radar_Secret_Service"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mst3k.wikia.com/wiki/Radar_Secret_Service</a><p><i>In this film universe radar is everywhere and can do anything - find valuable mineral deposits deep underground, locate large schools of fish underwater, etc, and all from thousands of miles away! Worship radar at the church of your choice.</i><p>Of course, in 1950 radar was an amazing war-winning technology that only MIT researchers and Air Force techs had any direct experience with. Sixty years later, now that radar has come <i>and gone</i> as a trendy police speed-measurement technology (it's all about the LIDAR now) and every local weatherperson has had a big Doppler radar display for twenty years, radar is kind of normal.<p>People's attitude toward genetics is such that if a woman is handed a genetic profile of a black man and told it is hers she will <i>actually entertain thoughts that she might be a black man</i>. People hear that they have the gene ""for"" some rare disease (""p < 0.05"") and then <i>contemplate suicide</i> because the Book of Destiny has foretold their certain doom. This attitude is no joke: It really is an intense, potentially traumatic emotional experience to read a genetic scan at this point. One is reminded of the cultures in which people think that being photographed is to have one's soul stolen. Laugh at such cultures at your peril, for in our own culture to read one's <i>genes</i> is to read one's soul, one's essence, and one's entire future.<p>These beliefs will fade eventually. I actually think the 23andme incident might be helpful for public education. The biggest problem with genetic data at this point is that people take it way, way too seriously. Turning it into a laughingstock would be a positive development. Reading genes needs to feel more like reading the <i>Daily Racing Form</i>, or shopping for fashionable prescription sunglasses, and less like touring a funeral home, scoring poorly on the SAT, or attending an exorcism.<p>(Of course, as someone who almost certainly does <i>not</i> harbor the gene for Huntington's disease, this is easy for <i>me</i> to say.)",1279383543

They are however making confident, clever marketing moves to continue to build their brand in inventive ways nobody has really done before. This recent one is especially clever in light of the fact that what they're doing isn't particularly inventive in an engineering sense, so the innovation is purely in public image. It's not going to completely counter their recent tailspin, but it's a lot stronger than I can imagine most other companies attempting. The only other one that I would believe capable of this sort of play is Coca-Cola.<p>And so yes, if anyone else does dare try the ""we have cool testing facilities"" move, they'll be patently copying Apple's marketing — not that this hasn't happened before.<p>The only other companies I've seen try to spotlight their facilities as being really cool and beneficial to customers have been car companies with their automated assembly lines and Intel.

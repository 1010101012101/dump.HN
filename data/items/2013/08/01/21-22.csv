I love that it&#x27;s smart enough to use a regex to figure out the card type.<p>As others have said, some minor instructional text would help people get started. Also, making the name and expiration fields more obvious from the start (more obvious that they&#x27;re fields and more obvious that they will need to be filled out) would also be helpful.<p>Having to click to flip the card is probably the biggest problem (though fixable). Typically when filling out a form, I suspect most people use the tab key to go from field to field. Having to go back to the trackpad/mouse and click on a spot slows things down. Maybe have the card automatically flip if you hit tab after the expiration field?",1375394383

Without additional information, there is nothing to indicate anything is wrong.<p>* You can tab from the date to the hidden CVV and enter information there, but you don&#x27;t see it.  This is easily done because the automatic progression is inconsistent, so I&#x27;ve had to tab twice before getting to the year, and because it automatically moves me there, I end up on the CVV.

It wasn&#x27;t that the exercises were too hard to answer.  My complaint is that I couldn&#x27;t even comprehend what some were asking me to do.  To me, it was like the exercises were written in French, a language I don&#x27;t speak.  If I could understand what the exercises were asking for, then I could have realized I&#x27;m missing something and re-read the section.  But as they were written, it made me feel like I should temporarily put the book down and re-take physics and calculus.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=eSlRd6MnDv8&t=479"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=eSl...</a>",1375394026

He believed that Ox was likely Julian Assange or Assanges then-second-in-command, Daniel Schmitt  the German activist Daniel Domscheit-Berg. Shortly thereafter, Manning encouraged Ox to use a different handle to contact him, Nathaniel, after the author Nathaniel Frank.<p>Manning said his ensuing discussions with Nathaniel, often about the classified material, became friendly, enjoyable and long. In retrospect, I realize these dynamics were artificial, Manning continued. They were valued more to me than Nathaniel.&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;But Manning said that no one at WikiLeaks ever encouraged him to leak  which may be significant, if the U.S. government is, as rumored, considering charging Assange in connection to the leaks.<p>No one associated with the WLO [WikiLeaks Organization] pressured me to give them more information, Manning said. The decision to give documents to WikiLeaks [was] mine alone.&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;...Manning said he first tried to take his information to the Washington Post, the New York Times and Politico, before contacting WikiLeaks.&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;I never hid the fact that I downloaded copies of CIDNE-I and CIDNE-A and burned them onto CDs, Manning said, even labeling and storing them in the open in his units tactical operations center. Nor did he hide that he also downloaded compression software to facilitate the transfer, Manning said.&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;In each of these cases, Manning denied that he was compromising national security. The military activities in Iraq and Afghanistan were often historic, with its intelligence value perishable after 48 to 72 hours. The Guantanamo Bay documents had no useful intelligence and did not disclose any results of detainee interrogations. The State Department cables were available to thousands of people throughout the government. A Washington Post reporter, David Finkel, had already written about a deadly Apache helicopter attack in 2007, in which civilians were killed, that Manning viewed on video.&quot;<p>I know that most news organizations have a slant to their reporting. Please do find me the transcript of Manning&#x27;s statement so that I can see where he gives the impression that he was hung out to dry by either Wikileaks, or Assange himself.",1375391828

There turns out to be a lot of research from the ACM SIGCSE (Computer Science Education) community. The McCracken Group paper &quot;A multi-national, multi-institutional study of assessment of programming skills of first-year CS students&quot; and several follow-on studies suggest that getting students to learn programming is truly difficult, a universal observation not just limited to the US. Student performance are often bimodal in intro classes. Also, our conventional assessment tools do not measure programming skill very well. I haven&#x27;t encountered any data on this, but anecdotally, it seems the expectation gap is considerably different from say the expectation-skill gap in electrical and mechanical engineers. If anyone has any perspective on this, I am really interested in hearing about it.<p>Aside: At least in some (advanced?) compiler courses, we do teach students how to implement exception handling semantics in a compiler.

In fact Volvo went through three pretty different styles before adopting the more modern sort that spool - the one in the image, the one right after that in the later PVs, 120, and 220 series that had the red levers, and the one in 140 and later Amazons with the hoops. So it was sort of a moot point really. Auto manufacturers would not have much trouble at all to come-up with their own three point belts that were different enough, and really they were all pretty different than those Volvo style front ones, some early Mercedes ones were similar in latch but different in many respects too. What was unique about Volvo was that they had a study to see if they were efficacious and how quickly they adopted them because of the leadership and goals of the company at the time.

I can do that standing on my head&quot;<p>I mean, the thing you have to understand is that the pages that really hurt are the ones that come when you are tired already, right before you are planning on sleeping... you are most likely to mess things up then, and it interferes with your sleep, which means you are more likely to screw things up the next day.   So limiting it to 12 hours is pretty goddamn nice.  You have 12 hours that you can sleep, which sounds super easy.<p>So yeah, I&#x27;ve been on 24x7x365 pager for more of my life than I haven&#x27;t... but the worst pager I&#x27;ve ever been on was only 12 hours a day for 7 days a month... why?<p>For most of my career?   the pages that actually wake me up have a frequency between once every month or two and twice a week.  Sometimes it gets worse, but then you look at what the root causes are, you fix them, and it gets better.<p>At this place, though?  during that 12 hour shift, there was a serious (like &#x27;fix this now or we lose tens of thousands of dollars an hour in revenue serious)   issue every 30 minutes.   Most of it was not technically difficult, but you had better be fast.<p>Essentially, you&#x27;d work one 84 hour week out of four.   And actually work those 84 hours;  like literally  you had to find someone to cover for you when you had to take a shit; (or you just bring your laptop)  it was that bad.    (On top of that, then you had your usual architectural responsibilities... but realistically, you didn&#x27;t get any of that done during pager week, and you were usually pretty useless for the next week or two.    This is one of the reasons we didn&#x27;t have more of it automated.)<p>so yeah.  In corporate land, yeah, you usually get shifts... but if someone fucks it up in corporate land?  (In this case, there was... cultural pushback against automating the failures.   We were supposed to diagnose hardware problems as we went.  Hahah.  Yeah right.)    things can get really nasty, really fast.",1375391649

When I say &quot;clearly harmful&quot; I mean that it is as clearly harmful as anything ever gets in the software industry.<p>Software patents are good for lawyers. Software patents are good for monopolists who want to control a market without having to compete for it.<p>Software patents are not good for software developers, who are frequently prohibited from reading patents by their employers,  rarely read patents even when allowed to, in any case don&#x27;t speak the legal language in which they are written.<p>Software patents are not good for startups, who have no way of discovering whether they are in violation of patents short of going to market and seeing whether they are sued; a lawsuit can easily bankrupt a startup regardless of the merits.<p>Software patents are not good for large companies, who have to waste enormous amounts of their employees&#x27; time making up bullshit patents just so they can have an arsenal of defensive patents with which to ward off other large companies.<p>Software patents are not good for open source, which neither needs nor wants the temporary monopoly that is the point of getting a patent in the first place.<p>Software patents are not good for software users, who suffer from reduced marketplace competition, increased vendor lock-in, and a more sluggish pace of progress overall due to the opportunity cost of the time wasted on patenting things and dealing with bullshit patent lawsuits.<p>Software patents are clearly harmful.",1375391631

6143505,comment,6143125,6143360,9,0,aznjons,,,"How ironic.<p>I would say that labeling someone who posted factual evidence that M-66 explosives are in fact legal and relatively ordinary recreational fireworks as an &quot;outrage tourist&quot; is a beautiful  example of character assassination. Far more so than merely alluding to the title of a self-identified media correspondent who goes on to make a defense that the photos are public and that law enforcement can access them, while de-emphasizing/distracting from the fact that neither google searches for pressure cookers nor facebook photos of fireworks merit a law enforcement visit. Verbatim from declan&#x27;s G+ post &quot;Having curious local cops ask you questions about your public photos of explosives is not [a big story].&quot;<p>If one or the other is potentially happening, then there is a cause for concern that at least justifies a personal article on medium by Catalano. Had law enforcement actually revealed to Catalano, that hey, we&#x27;re visiting you because you posted fireworks on your facebook, then she probably wouldn&#x27;t have written that article. However, being investigated in a Kafkaesque manner, where you have little idea what your original crime could have been since you are a law-abiding citizen (searching for pressure cookers or posting fireworks photos on facebook is pretty innocuous behavior) might lead to legitimate speculation on the methods of law enforcement.<p>EDIT: None of this is to say that mass media isn&#x27;t overly eager to report stories without enough support, and kudos to declan&#x27;s investigative skills and intent, but I do think that drawing conclusions based on contrarianism and real character assassination of someone who added legitimate facts to the discussion isn&#x27;t very productive.",1375390837

This is by no means a limitation on patents but by the bodies that grant them.<p>It also isn&#x27;t a matter of the bar being low for patents applicants.

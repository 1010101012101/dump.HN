193954,comment,193619,193952,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"Yeah, that's why I thought 50 semi-independent units might do the trick.  I figure one for the islands out in the Pacific, and one for the big chunk hanging off of Canada; and the other 48 can divide the piece between Canada and Mexico.  I've even got cute names picked out, if you'd like to hear them...",1211190927

Saturday night for the high school kids is getting drunk in a corn field or behind one of the strip mall. 1) Suburbia is a misallocation of resources, fully dependent on cheap energy. 2) Suburbia is a cultural failure, unable to create and nurture community and creativity. Cities have the economic, infrastructure and cultural efficiencies made possible by scale.<p>Now in Ann Arbor (semi-suburbia) by way of DC (kick ass mass transit, great neighborhoods, huge parks).",1211190485

193950,comment,193741,193741,0,0,Tichy,,,"This morality thing was already done nicely in the early Ultimas (I think starting with IV, or V). I remember the one dungeon where you are attacked by a monster called ""little children"". Before you had been trained to never fight children because it immediately makes you lose your virtues.<p>I don't think Molyneux approach sounds very scientific, though. What is scientific about giving game figures an artificial idea of morals? Scientific for me would be to not make those inbuilt, but let them evolve and see why certain morals make for more successful societies than others.<p>Sorry to rant about this, but it is one of my pet peeves with games (like civilization). They claim to be simulations, but they are not - they are just projections of the game designers limited perspective and morals. Of course the same could be said for many books and movies, too. I don't like it there, either, but somehow I feel that with games it is another dimension. The pseudo-simulation somehow makes the opinions of the game creators seem more legitimate.",1211190171

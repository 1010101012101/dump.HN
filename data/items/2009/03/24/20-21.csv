530802,comment,530600,530606,0,0,nickf,,,"Here we go:<p>There's essentially 3 types of certificate:<p>DV - Domain Validation. The cheap, automated ones. Certs contain no more than the domain name they're issued to, and the whole process is automated.<p>OV - Organisational Validation. The original 'standard' of certs, that most CAs issued until a few years back. Domain ownership checked, business checked (for legal existence and verified address).<p>EV - Extended Validation. The new 'green bar' standard. Lots of hoops to jump through - agreements, legally-notarised letters, checking of business existence with local govt. & third parties, phone number verification, verification that the person requesting the cert actually has the right to do so....and so on.<p>The question then becomes: why?<p>The OV and DV sadly appear the same to the user. A few years back, one CA decided to issue the certs purely based on domain checking. Automation = cheap certs = big, fast marker share. It took, they made money.\nThen a time came to do something about the DV certs (ie making the browser chrome showing them 'less' secure or similar). By this time, the big boys in the CA world had aquired the company and had a pretty penny invested in the DV certs not becoming the red-headed stepchild.<p>So the CAs and the browser and the OS people invented EV. There's still talk that DV will be 'downgraded' one day, but we'll see.<p>Other types: Wildcards as someone mentioned will cover unlimited subdomains of the domain they're issued to (traditionally certs are for single FQDNs).\nThen we've got the new UCC for MS Exchange/OCS which has multiple, unique FQDNs in a single cert.\nThen you've got client & email certs, code-signing, and more :)",1237927848

This is an advantageous meme for consumers, and nearly everyone sees more individual consumption transactions than production transactions, so it's not going to go away, no matter how much more we drill people in economics.<p>""They need to be somewhat expensive to not dilute the amount of valid certs.""<p>I don't understand you.  The validity of a cert isn't dependent on its cost, though as you note, steps taken to ensure validity drive up cost.  In any case, virtually no one is served by getting a more expensive cert these days, now that $50 and lower certs are available and just as trusted by browser manufacturers.  The original idea that cert providers would verify actual identity has given way to the idea that certs only verify that the encryption really comes from the website itself, rather than some middleman.

Consumers then get to keep the 'excess' value delivered.  The lower price also brings in consumers for whom the product delivers less value.<p>So when you have a product, like SSL certificates, where the marginal cost of production is nearly zero, it is fair to ask why the certificates aren't nearly free.<p>(And since the certificates are not free, and so the providers seem to be printing money, we have to ask how all of us missed out on this business.)",1237926859

Go a step further -- the Fed accepted these CDS-wrapped assets as collateral for TSLF/TALF loans -- so the same statements about banks could be applied to the Fed, they either didn't do the due diligence on the collateral or they are complicit in breaking the law.

Any idea can be made to work in fictional form; the interesting question is whether it works in <i>real life</i>, and fiction has a way of obscuring that extremely heavily.<p>The work that really solidified my opinion of this was ""The World of Null-A"". It is based around the ""General Semantics"" philosophy (which, if you've never heard of, the name doesn't really help you know what it is: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Semantics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Semantics</a> ). I like to characterize such works as: ""Masses don't do X, aww, sad, it fails. Hero does X. Wow! Masses try to hold the hero down, but the mighty power of X shall prevail! Wow, X is awesome!"" In the context of a fictional world, this is an entirely specious argument.<p>It is somewhat ironic that my final rebellion against this form was in the context of a work on General Semantics. It could be argued that rebelling against being manipulatively fed the ideas of General Semantics is in fact General Semantic's moment of glory. In fact I think they are good ideas, I just didn't think the fictional treatment of them proved anything.<p>Consequently, I have no interest in something like Atlas Shrugged, and I have simply read directly about Objectivism, as a for instance.

I just do not consider them very good arguments or demonstrations of that idea; instead I enjoy the works simply as coming from an author that is aware of the ideas, refreshing in much the same way it is refreshing to read a work where the author actually comprehends economics, or military strategy, or science in general. (Star Trek being my canonical example of something that stands in opposition to all of those...)<p>And yes, personal bias too.

Ironically NYU CS majors are required to take several classes that use Java, so I guess he wasn't able to convince the administration of his views. However, I learned a tremendous amount from the algorithms and OS courses there, and there were some great classes still using C and C++.",1237925019

I know that the Namecheap RapidSSL cert is single root and at that price, you can't go wrong.<p>One of the things to note about SSL certificates: don't think you can renew them like you can a domain name.  When you renew, you get a new cert that you have to install on your server.  So buying multiple years at a time can save you a lot of hassle (and drive the cost per year down).<p>Many certificate companies have bilked their customers into paying too much, but there is competition.  It's just that people change slowly.  Plus, if you're, say, Citibank, what are the odds that you're going to quibble over $1,000/year?  For many businesses, it just isn't worth the hassle of switching.  Even a company that I used to work for used to pay nearly my salary to an outside firm for content management (and they didn't even have a good CMS).  So, many companies will just keep paying and it's one of those situations where the markup is more valuable than pushing additional units.",1237924879

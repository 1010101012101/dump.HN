878271,story,,,83,81,Vivtek,"Ask HN: Tell me why a room-and-board-and-bandwidth incubator is a stupid idea",,"So a little while back, I bought a big old brick house in Richmond, Indiana (for $8000).  (cf. http://big-old-house.blogspot.com for the blow-by-blow). It's really a whole hell of a lot more room than I need, and - the kicker - it's not alone.  There are a boatload of beautiful old brick buildings here, just no economic reason for anybody sane to buy them.  There's even a 23-unit building of single-bedroom apartments two or three blocks away from me, standing empty.  Lots of these houses are standing empty; there's just nobody left to live in them.<p>So I had this stupid idea, and I'm not even sure it's a stupid idea: why not sponsor young (or non-young) entrepreneurs by giving them rooms or small apartments, server space, good bandwidth, and home-cooked but free food?  In return, perhaps a percentage take of whatever they came up with during a certain fellowship period, or whatever other venture capitalists take as their cut.  Later in the game, actual capital would be available (it's not on the table, not from me, not right now).  But the idea is to build an active and close-knit, quasi-academic, community.  There was definitely an era in my life when I would have jumped at such an opportunity, and I'd still seriously consider it.<p>So tell me: in how many ways is it stupid?  I love these old buildings; given just a little economic rationale, they're eminently salvageable (people built to <i>last</i> in the 1880's and 90's).",1255405519

878265,comment,877896,877896,0,0,wdavis,,,"The borrower is SLAVE to the lender.  This statement has been true since the creation of the floating rock.  Our grandparents knew this. That's a big reason why they are the ""greatest generation"". They live by this creed and thus prospered. We ignore it so we pay...and pay....and pay.<p>There are two issues I have with our system.of education\n1) who said that college was all that important\n2) why is there a necessity to jump from high school directly to college.\nThe apprenticeship model works ten times better.  In my opinion an aspiring lawyer would do much better if he just got a job working at a law firm.  By working his way up he/she would gain valuable experience, hands on training, and here it comes MAKE MONEY. Even if he worked for peanuts the experience alone would be worth more than a college or university could ever teach.  I would bet any amount of money that, after the same eight years the apprentice would have spent in some pampered cocoon of a college/university, he/she would be a better lawyer than 99% of Yale or Harvard graduates who at most may have done an internship.   The same goes for doctors.  Even still, if the individual wanted the college experience let him have a year or two to learn how the world works.  It's not doing any of these teenagers any good to go from the sheltered atmosphere of mom and dad's to that big and expensive procrastination of true life we call college.  By experiencing life and understanding the value of a dollar, individuals will be better prepared to make proper financial decisions.  Furthermore, by waiting a few years and not throwing people (in there most immature and naive stage in life) you avoid the ignorance and stupidity that is college life.<p>If an individual decides to seek their higher learning from one of our countries institutions the first lesson taught should always be: the borrower is slave to the lender.",1255405186
878264,comment,878226,878257,0,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>what is one to think when affirmative action programs are in place?</i><p>I wish I could be 100 percent sure that today's affirmative action programs operate like the first one I heard of (in 1968), when the idea of the program is that it connected students who didn't have college-educated parents to colleges that easily gained applications from children of alumni, but didn't get many applications from first-generation college students. Then what I would think of anyone admitted under an affirmative action program is, ""It's only fair that he is here too, even though he didn't have the advantage I had of being a third-generation college student."" But it's not clear now, college-by-college, just what happens in detail when the admission committee meets to decide whom to admit.<p>The great majority of United States colleges admit nearly all of their applicants. Hundreds of colleges have explicit open-enrollment policies.

The disagree is because I don't think they should have to or that customers are entitled to act indignantly when it doesn't happen.)<p>Tiger are clearly positioned in the marketplace around lowest cost. That's almost certainly why wakeless and everyone else on this flight booked with them, as opposed to Qantas, Virgin etc - Tiger was cheaper. Qantas (I believe) would have paid for accommodation due to a cancellation (and possibly avoided the cancellation to prevent the expense of that policy) - but when you chose to pay $100 less for a flight, you waived that entitlement.<p>Why are Tiger cheaper? Because they have stricter policies and fewer, perhaps less-trained or experienced staff, and they build a business model on those factors, not around caring for you. If you want somebody to care, be prepared to pay for it.<p>Obvious exceptions to this rule apply when a business engages in misleading conduct. And I reiterate that I would like to see more companies caring.<p>But if I buy the cheapest shoes, drive the cheapest second-hand car, and fly the cheapest airline, I'm not in a position to complain about cheap customer service.<p>Edit: None of this means wakeless shouldn't have complained in the way he did, or even cried blue murder at the airport.

Perhaps find or start a club that meets regularly to discuss business ideas.  If you do leave school, at least make a visit to the registrar's office and file a leave of absense, claiming economic hardship or whatever, so you can easily return in a year or two if necessary.  Perhaps you can come up with a business project you can work on while taking the minimum necessary number of hours.<p>I have heard that grades and completing college do not correlate well with various measures of life success (apparently high school grades and completion do).  I have also heard that dropping out with straight A's is one of the best predictors of future success.   That makes sense to me, although I can't say which way the causal relationship goes; but I would not neglect the grades even if you plan to leave.<p>You might put some energy and effort into finding classes you think will be worthwhile.  Often various bureaucratic requirements of being in a certain major or pre-requisites can be waived by petition or lobbying the professor.<p>If you truely feel you are wasting your time, leave in an organized, purposeful fashion.  Let the school know, preserve the ability to come back if that is easy, preserve your fraternal network and other friends by letting them know and maintaining contact.  As you begin to tell professors and friends that you feel you are wasting your time and are leaving, you may find opportunities at school open up, or that you get tips to interesting places to work.",1255403126

Totally what we did with our new pivot \n(same market B2C Customers - Saas), that is now in the works (didn't do this first time around, and paid for it). Only difference, we told the customer that these were just high fidelity screen mockups for the product we will eventually be building.<p>Get your screens in front of customers before you ever code. It is mind BLOWING!<p>Wonder how well this would work for consumer web... thoughts?",1255403080

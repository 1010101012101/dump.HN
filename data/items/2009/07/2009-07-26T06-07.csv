It teaches entrepreneurs a few important lessons:<p>1- Don't waste time trying to raise capital unless the money is crucial to your survival.<p>2- Persistence is almost the single most important quality of successful entrepreneurs.<p>3- A deal is never truly a deal even if it is on paper. Sometimes the guys across the table will make it so difficult you wish you never signed a deal with them.<p>4- If a partner cannot make his mind in x days, move forward and when they come back, respectfully turned them down.<p>5- (Repeating 2) Never ever quit. ""Be water"" and adapt to the market.",1248591162

What the hell does that even mean?  I had a lady once ask what ""following my twitter"" meant, because she wasn't sure what my ""twitter"" was.  Seriously, 10 years ago, had you asked a random woman to follow your Twitter around, you'd get slapped first, and there would be no asking questions later.<p>NOTE: I ALWAYS say ""follow me on twitter"" or ""follow me on twitter.com"" now - geezers like it when you add .com because it reminds them of the only 3 years of their life they actually made money in the stock market.<p>Long story short, don't get bent over backwards because you think this person is a follower-whore.

724128,comment,714770,723508,0,0,jimmybot,,,"Well, you're right about it being formal sounding because almost no one uses anything but the common name, 英國.  And even in your example, the Eng part of England is still in there and not in the English.  So that's my point--in English, the trend has been to use UK, a neutral term that does not contain anything about England or Britain, which there are groups of people that feel very strongly against.  But in Chinese, there is this linguistic lag (maybe forever), and England is still a part of the common name for the UK.<p>In Taiwan, there's a (I find) humorous translation of 蔣中正 as Chiang Kai-shek.  It's as if they knew they'd be laughed at if they tried to translate the Generalissimo's name as Fair and Upright Jiang.<p>Also the competing translations of Tibet as 西藏 (a Qing term that locates Tibet as the West, or in other words, in relation to its location relative to China) and the newer term 圖博, which is much closer to Tibetan (and the English).<p>Anyways, not even really disagreeing with your original point to call Peking Beijing, but linguistic lag is actually a quite common phenomenon, and while you notice it in this case, there are many cases where things aren't really consistent, but you may not have noticed.",1248589354

Sale of product rarely happens by itself, you need someone who is passionate about getting those deals set up.<p>The hard part is finding a sales person who also truly believes in your product and gels with the team. I have worked with some awful sales people, who even when they sell can be terrible for your company (often selling the wrong thing). The first sales person in your organisation, I believe, should not be paid commission, but be paid just like the rest of the founders and have a long term interest in the company.",1248588776

Presuming it's not some sort of consumer play, if one of the founders is not good at sales, you'd sure as hell better (1) learn to sell and/or (2) bring in sales talent. Preferably #1 before #2. The absolute worst mistake you can make is focusing on a fancy technology without bringing in dollars.<p>Look at the way a typical company runs. They spend huge sums of money on third-rate products, many of which have a superior alternative available. Why didn't they buy the better product? Why do vendors with clearly inferior products get the sales dollars that a vendor with a better product doesn't? It's because the vendor with a good sales team gets the product to the customer, and the fact is that a mind-blowing offering will not get bought unless there's some guy getting that customer to buy that product. If you can combine a fantastic product with a great sales team, watch out. But if you've got a great product but aren't selling early, don't look for a technical solution out of a business problem.",1248588089

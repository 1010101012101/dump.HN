Should I choose to place strict requirements, I get more protection and probably fewer bookings. I like having the choice. Airbnb just took the choice away from me and Im not happy about it.</i><p>Before we get into arguments about the validity of libertarianism...I think it shouldn't be shocking that when a company becomes large (with more at stake), they have to act in ways that will be overbearing in comparison to what they were before.<p>The quoted complaint above could easily apply to, let's say, the Apple iOS store, in which decisions are made <i>heavily</i> in favor of playing it safe and clean. I would like to argue that I'm wise enough to make my own choices about downloading immoral/unpleasant apps...and I'm entitled to make that argument. However, I can't argue that this...ahem, proactive policy prevents a great many shit-fests that might otherwise arise were it not in place. And I really can't dispute that Apple so far been wildly successful in the app marketplace.<p>Likewise, from Airbnb's perspective, I can see why they've made the calculation that proactively <i>preventing</i> scammers is overall, a good business decision.

Please understand that I'm not advocating for JS crypto or ignoring its other problems.<p>> Who would it be readable to if not the site operators?<p>SSL offers no protection against the following:<p>Amazon AWS employees. Azure employees. External attackers with read-only access. Employees of the website with read-only access. Employees that get curious and want to snoop, but not badly enough to inject code. Anybody with access to the backups. Other tenants on the same cloud who notice that memory or storage wasn't properly zeroed. Someone who breaks into the office and physically steals the server.<p>> So it might be useful to someone, somewhere as a legal subterfuge.<p>If you acknowledge that it's sufficient to prevent evidence recovery, and you have taken the position that is the <i>only</i> practical scenario under which that property has any utility, you're not a very creative thinker. I'll try to expand your mind a little. I tried to use an easy real example.<p>There was a Google ""Site Reliability Engineer"" who got fired for snooping on young girls chats and harassing them. He or others in his position would not have been able to deploy new gmail code to perform an active attack, but reading offline storage is trivial. If Gmail sent down Javascript that did the crypto before they got it, this employee would not have been able to do that. I'm reasonably confident that rogue Google or facebook employees aren't going to target me, insert active attacks, and get away with it. I'm not very confident that nobody there will ever passively snoop (don't even need to speculate, both companies have had public incidents at least once).<p><a href=""http://www.informationweek.com/security/vulnerabilities/dropbox-files-left-unprotected-open-to-a/231000111"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informationweek.com/security/vulnerabilities/drop...</a><p><i>""Dropbox on Monday acknowledged that its vast store of files was left open to the world on Sunday for four hours as a result of a bug.

It is inherently unfair to charge by-the-copy for goods that cost $0 to manufacture, but we accept the obscene profits that the industry winners make because it's hard and risky to envision or implement other models.<p>Many FOSS licenses including the GPL encourage the programmer to charge as much as she wishes for the software. But, if we allow the customer the same rights as they have with tangible (physical) goods, then they're allowed to turn around and give away copies for nothing, undercutting the original developer. So we might as well just give it away.<p>If only there were a way to ensure that the original developer gets compensated for the time they spend developing their work, but still permits software to be sold without draconian restrictions.<p>I was really excited when Kickstarter came along because that was the closest thing to a ""fair"" business model that I had encountered: customers don't receive the product until enough people agree to purchase the product.<p>If more marketplaces existed that we creators of ""intangible goods"" could take advantage of, I think we'd see a lot more, higher-quality FOSS software. Creative commons by-sa-licensed works of illustration, literature, and music, too.<p>Kickstarter's model is one of many variants.

5790989,comment,5789637,5790437,2,0,obstacle1,,,"1) The author isn't arguing that. He is objecting to the portrayal of startups as more free, open, and fluid than traditional enterprise. Unless I'm bad at reading the author didn't even mention the ratio of startup:traditional jobs, so that isn't relevant. And the objection wasn't to the fact that all startups are roughly equivalent (which was, though, a point made). The objection was that startups are roughly equivalent to traditional enterprise in structure, form, and execution (i.e. Super Cool Startup is just as non-free, non-open, and non-fluid as Enterprise Shop Inc., and this is systemic). The equivalence comes from the startup scene having been wholly co-opted by a system (VC-istan, anyone?) that amounts to traditional enterprise (formulaic, mass-producing, repeatable templates). This is a textbook binary deconstruction: the startup/corporate dichotomy as it exists in popular consciousness is false.<p>Food for thought, see pg's comment in this thread: apparently there is now a formula for creativity and rebellion. Questions: if you can formulaically rebel, how is that rebellion? By definition your 'rebellion' is deterministic -- how is that possible? If 'creativity' can come by formula, what are you creating? The 'new' is just a function of what you already knew, i.e., it already existed. So the 'new' is by definition not new at all.<p>2) Again, the author didn't make this point. He argued that people considering taking a startup job should consciously look through popular delusion and consider the bad with the good. There was no mention that one should or shouldn't take a particular kind of job.",1369889415
5790988,comment,5789637,5790681,31,0,ibdknox,,,"The word ""formula"" is very important in his statement - yes we have techniques for coming up with new ideas, but we do not have a formula for it. A formula produces a consistent and reproducible result. If we actually had such a thing it'd be the real-life equivalent of a magic lamp; make a wish for a new idea about x and out it comes.<p>The reality of the situation is far too messy for such a clean solution to exist. There are an infinite number of variables, biases, and contexts that foster or hinder ""creativity"" and the very notion of ""rebellion"" is defined entirely by context. So while we may have techniques that increase our chances of coming up with new ideas, we're no where near a factory for <i>real</i> creativity.<p>EDIT: I define real creativity as ""reasoned new ideas"" - it's trivial to write a formula for combining things randomly, but I don't think anyone here would argue that as actual creativity.",1369889414

That in turn causes another delta and so on. This is similar to SVN where every change is a delta from the previous state. That means that you'll need to codify every possible diff through your view hierarchy/graph. For simple stuff, they have built-in tools to help you do this. For complex views, that's really difficult or impossible (you can get into conflicts and deadlocks).<p>React makes it easy by simply regenerating a copy of the next view.

Brainwave tech from Neurosky & haptic devices from Fleshlight are also supported.<p>The new tech mixes allow users to control a sex-sims naturally & intuitively. HMDs provide accurate head tracking & immersive high quality 3D stereo graphics. Markerless tracking allows natural control through body motion, simple h& gestures & speech comm&s. EEG brainwave reading technology adjusts the simulation based on the focus of the user while haptic devices like the Fleshlight (tm) stimulate users physically while enjoying a sexperience.<p>To empower community development thriXXX is starting up an 'Open VR Sex API' project incorporating feedback from developers & other interested parties worldwide. The intent is create an API that is small, powerful easy to use & agile so programmers can tie together current & future off-the-shelf hardware & modify sex simulation based content in new unique ways to make it appropriate for different audiences, contexts & purposes.<p>About VRSexKit.com

I never tried to set out that what I was saying was representative of bullying in general, as I've never made a study of the issue. I tried to put qualifiers around what I reported was based upon my limited, personal, anecdotal experience.<p>For the record, I do not blame the victim. I've done my speaking stint with a battered women's shelter in my area, I've seen and worked with victims aplenty and have a perspective that informs me better than to blame the victim. But victims need to know there are ways to stand up, get help, and get out of the situation. In some settings where bullying takes place in the US public school system (the context that I'm familiar with), there might actually be no help feasibly available. Facing the reality that one might have to fight back (and note that I first described it in a metaphorical sense of redirecting the bullying's energy in a judo-like manner), is to acknowledge this situation on the ground, and does not mean I desire to blame the victim or in any way stop advocating for more assistance infrastructure like what we have for battered women.<p>If you have a more studied perspective, or your own personal views that influence how you view the issue that can help the kids getting bullied today, then I encourage you to share it here. If you want to go down the ""...congratulating yourself for having it relatively easy..."" road, then we all here discussing about bullying could be guilty of the same characterization, because this is #firstworldproblems to an orphaned 6-year old girl on the streets of Mumbai.

For now there's no ability to customize the tabs. At all. WYSIWYG. Not even the label. The ""+"" is just a shortcut to enable/disable one of the 4 additional tabs (besides Primary, that is always visible).<p>Overall, this is clearly a beta version, so it'll be interesting to see how they improve the functionality over the next releases.

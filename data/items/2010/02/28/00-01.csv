Their wages were much lower than American wages.  The justification by we Americans was that they were paid better by the Company than they would get in Panama.  It's the standard imperial justification and it's wrong.<p>Panama has done quite well without America and their wages have improved.  This isn't universally true but the justification that this is just something that every country must go through is wrong factually and morally.

1156143,comment,1155960,1156056,0,0,nagrom,,,"It's a commonly-received truth that children are not sufficiently developed to make potentially abusive deals. This is why we have laws against sex with children, why children cannot legally gamble or take out loans and why children have special labour laws. An adult is considered to be sufficiently mature to look after themselves, a child is not.<p>The employer is not the person who should provide food and shelter for kids - that's the parents' job. And 'some work' is often a euphemism for development-stunting, dangerous, exhausting labour which can harm the child for life.<p>Of course, one can argue that the child needs to work to survive, if its parents cannot support it. That's a separate issue. In this case the child needs a responsible adult to act in locus parentis, whether that is another adult or a state or charity. However, banning child labour is not an immoral choice and refusing to accept the products of it is not immoral either. I am surprised at your apparent astonishment that people are against the entire concept of child labour.<p>I suspect that your next argument in favour of the concept is that it would be immoral to take away the job of a child who relies upon that support. I'd argue that, in fact, the moral lapse lies with the parents and society that allows a vulnerable person to be put into that position without having had a chance to mature properly first.",1267318136

1156135,comment,1155954,1156073,0,0,tptacek,,,"You've probably heard the term ""buffer overflow"". A buffer overflow is one example of a memory corruption flaw. In virtually all modern memory corruption exploits, the goal of the attacker is to corrupt a victim program in such a way that they can upload their own code into the victim and run it.<p>For about 8 years (95-'03, the ""summer of worms""), the bulk of all the work in stopping these attacks was directed at the broken code that allowed the vulnerabilities (for instance, the use of strcpy() and sprintf(), which are unbounded). The payoff for this work went asymptotic.<p>Starting in the late '90s and really picking up in the '00s, research instead went into hardening runtimes to break exploits. For instance, you can't simply overwrite the activation record for a function to change the return address, because there's a random cookie there. The stack and heap aren't executable, and the text segment isn't writeable. The whole runtime is randomized, so you can't predict addresses.<p>What papers like this (and, as Dave Aitel pointed out on Twitter, papers like John McDonalds from the 90s -- that guy is spooky) aim to show is that even if attackers can't literally upload x86 instructions into their targets, they can still take control of the process.<p>That's because even simple real-world programs are very complex at the runtime level, and linked to very complex libraries. The CPU can be coerced into executing any of the instructions in those libraries --- or, indeed, any sequence of bytes comprising any fragment of those instructions.<p>So, if you do some basic binary analysis on your target, you can craft a sequence of addresses in the target which, if executed in the right order, will have the same effect as any program you could write (it's ""turing complete"", but a more helpful way to think about it is that they're synthesizing a simple VM running out of fragments of code).<p>As far as we know, it is very hard to stop these kinds of attacks. An attacker that can write 1-4 bytes to an arbitrary (or even restricted) address in memory can trick the CPU into looking at attacker-controlled memory (say, the 1024 character login name they just gave you), and once the CPU is looking at that memory, it starts running sequences of its own code against itself.<p>This is systems programming, compiler theory, computer architecture, and computer security. If you're into serious practical CS, you're crazy if you don't consider security as a career. There are very few other jobs that will reliably expose you to so much CS (and even EE) at this level.",1267317895

1156133,comment,1154256,1155440,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"At this point, I think this thread has gone way too far of course, but I'll give clarification one more attempt.<p>I think the confusion here is in neglecting the various definitions of the word, ""conscientious,"" in combination with the aforementioned definition of the word, ""of."" In terms of <i>being guided by conscience</i>, or of <i>being thorough and assiduous</i> (two possible definitions), I agree that being ""conscientious of"" something makes absolutely no sense.<p>However, it can also mean to be <i>careful</i> (more along the lines of my intentions), in which case using ""of"" certainly makes sense, as you can be careful of some idea. Perhaps next time I comment, I'll just say ""careful"" to avoid the confusion.<p>Furthermore, it's important to remember that English is an ambiguous language. Part of the beauty (and perhaps the downside) of the language is that there are no rules, only guidelines (this is a good article on the subject: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/books/01book.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/books/01book.html</a>). The best we can do is to know our audience and tailor our language to most effectively communicate our message. If nothing else, this thread has at least taught me something of my audience (something I should have known: that we are all very detail-oriented and so care must be taken in our communication). Perhaps saying ""conscientious of"" was not the best and most effective use of the word, but to say it's ""wrong"" or unacceptable I think is quite naive.",1267317834

Maybe I need a stronger word than profusely....<p>On Darwin's side of the spectrum you have, well, Darwin. On other end of the spectrum you have people coming up with intricate ideas about how minorities are destroying everyone's lives.<p>Even though there is a lot of mental work in carefully choosing their illusory axioms to make the rest of their ideas naturally fall into place, I am very reluctant to call that work productive and I <i>do</i> think that it's pathetic.<p>Of course, the very same mistake was made with this person, who profusely blames the wrong thing, as the person who casually blames the wrong thing: they stopped trying to find the real problem too soon. There are only two words that come to mind: undignified and arrogant.<p>Arrogant that they're questioning the wrong thing and not questioning whether the output of their thought process is precise, and therefore they're not questioning the thought process itself.<p>Perhaps it is <i>questioning</i> that compels people into great, productive work. Depressed or not! Darwin held himself to high standards while he simultaneously, and perpetually, questioned his thoughts and the results of his thoughts. He did this to a point where his thoughts were very precise and congruent with the real world.<p>I <i>do not</i> think it was the depression that compelled him into productivity, but his dignity. Compelled into a productive depression! He couldn’t just shrug off his depression since that would mean ignoring certain issues. Again, this really is only my own speculation, but I don't think depression needs to exist in the amount that it does today. I don't think we're <i>born</i> depressed and very rarely chemically imbalanced.<p>Since so many minds are malfunctioning, these are not problems of the individual but signify a much larger problem: a problem of a malfunctioning thinking on a global scale. It is how people mis-attribute this malfunction that I find pathetic.<p>This ""malfunctioning of thinking"" expresses itself a lot in life. It accumulates and wears down on people to a point of depression or lethargy.<p>I should also point out that I don’t mean “pathetic” in the sense of “hate.” When it comes down to it, the problem is too complicated to just blame an individual and I can't expect everyone to have this natural dignity that Darwin possessed, or the will to teach it to themselves. I feel more compassionate at the individual's level than ticked off.<p>The reason I’m ranting a little bit is because I take issue with glorifying the wrong thing (not you, but implied in the article). In this case: depression. I hope this makes my thoughts on this clearer.<p>Also, checking out that book.",1267315705

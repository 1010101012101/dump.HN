4739186,comment,4738964,4739098,9,0,Camillo,,,"But Samsung <i>didn't</i> copy. The UK courts have ruled so, and they've made it clear that they consider it libel to say otherwise.<p>In fact, I question the article's premise. Samsung <i>did</i> invent the iPad, as well as the iPhone - except that theirs are called Galaxy S and Galaxy Tab. And they were able to do so while being a hardware manufacturer whose OS is provided by a third party, which calls the entire ""blame Microsoft"" theory into question.<p>The fact that Samsung's offerings arrived after Apple's means nothing: it is clear that they were developed independently, and the fact that they shipped later must have been due to the additional development time required to make their products less expensive, and thus technically superior. The timing was entirely accidental, a mere side effect of the fact that Apple had access to a mass of brainwashed fanbois that will buy anything with an Apple logo, which provided them with both the funding and the opportunity to target the deep-pocketed early-adopter market.<p>But in a world where Apple didn't exist, Samsung would have shipped the Galaxy family of products around the same time as they eventually did - and they would have looked just as they do, too. Any resemblance in design between Sammy's products and Apple's is due to convergent evolution: it is simply less efficient, if not thoroughly impossible, to make a smartphone or a tablet that doesn't feature that shape, that button, that grid of icons in those specific colors - or even one that doesn't ship in that type of box. Apple's claims to have ""invented"" any of that are tantamount to claiming ownership of a law of nature.<p>In the end, articles such as this are a waste of time. There is no secret to Apple's perceived success, no lesson to learn. Their headstart is doomed to evaporate against Android's irresistible growth, and they will be recorded as a mere curiosity (to avoid calling it a ""fad"" as it really deserves) in the books of history.<p>Hacker News has limited formatting capabilities, but, while reading the above, please imagine that there is a banner saying ""This is what Android fanatics actually believe"" at the bottom of your screen.",1352013148

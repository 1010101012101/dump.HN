8579443,comment,8578514,8579292,0,0,enraged_camel,,,">>I consider this pretty dangerous, because there&#x27;s nothing worse than gaining 2-3 levels in ability, but having to linger at a low level because your startup&#x27;s failure (which may or may not have been your fault; in my case, it wasn&#x27;t) invalidates the experience completely. You might fare better, psychologically, if you don&#x27;t go through the startup and gain levels of experience that you won&#x27;t be permitted to use in the next job. It&#x27;s easier to function if you&#x27;re at-level than if you gain 5 years of experience in 15 months but no one believes you.<p>Wow, this basically describes the frustrations I had with my previous job to the letter. While working there as an engineer, I also founded a successful community service non-profit on the side. Even though it was nothing like founding a &quot;real&quot; company, it still gave me 2.5 years of really solid experience with building, managing and leading teams of diverse people (among lots of other things). We became really successful in our space. It was great.<p>The problem? While working on the non-profit, I first caught up to and then surpassed my boss at my day job in management and leadership ability. He was my senior, yet I would see him make mistake after mistake, and I&#x27;d think, &quot;wow, I made that mistake like, 3 years ago.&quot; I tried to help but he wasn&#x27;t interested - he is very much the &quot;do my job during the day and then go home, drink some beer and watch sports&quot; type of guy. No drive for self-improvement, even when it became obvious that he was severely lacking. I ended up building a lot of contempt for him, and when my frustrations became too much, I left.",1415523578

8579434,comment,8579290,8579290,0,0,vicbrooker,,,"Steve Blank was recently in Melbourne and said that his opinion was that &#x27;experienced&#x27; was a better adjective than &#x27;failed&#x27; for founders who have stopped working on a startup. It&#x27;s a nice perspective.<p>Personally I agree, but would add a single caveat. I consider a founder &#x27;experienced&#x27; when they have made a good faith effort to attempt solving a difficult/worthwhile problem. Someone who succeeds at someone pedestrian isn&#x27;t terribly interesting and neither is someone who tried to build the hyperloop with paper mache for a week.<p>So, my advice is to ignore the title and give weight to the particular characteristics of their startup. The presence or absence of success is far less relevant than what they were trying to achieve and how they executed. I would pick someone who got to 80% of a home run over anyone who succeeded at hitting to first base. Ask questions about how they executed, the unique problems they faced and why they picked their vertical - this will tell you more about them than a snap judgement based on whether they were a CEO or a President.<p>On a side note, I would generally consider managing to found a company that survives for 1-2 years (full time) while tackling a hard problem as a demonstration of above average/high capacity. I would definitely look into them.<p>Again, depends on the context of your workplace, and the context of what they actually worked on.<p>Hope this helps.",1415523252

(e.g. &#x27;it can be confirmed with apps that measure your refresh rate&#x27;)
Usually that&#x27;s fine, but still a 60Hz refresh doesn&#x27;t mean that whatever program is rendering onto the screen is capable of getting 60 frames per second effectively being put out by the screen without dropping any frames. Which is ok for most everyday usage, but e.g. for neurosciences doing research of the visual system that is hardly sufficient. You really want to be 100% sure that whatever you tell a program to display, it does this correctly frame by frame. And the only way to make sure that happened is to use external, continuously recording, hardware (photodiode or high speed cameras).",1415523218
8579431,comment,8576411,8576571,0,0,tmbsundar,,,"May be documentation will need some time to catch up vis-a-vis the likes of R, Python etc., Understandably since it is a new language this may probably remain so for quite some time? For e.g., when I was trying to find out how to generate &quot;n&quot; random numbers in a uniform distribution from a range of -x to +x. In R the code is as simple as runif(n,-x,x). In matlab, it is a little bit contrived by offsetting and multiplying with the interval etc., But in Julia, the details do not go beyond the standard random functions that do not let you do this and no pointers to documentation beyond. But finally I was lucky to find an entry in the mailing list where I figured out I needed to use the &quot;Distributions&quot; package using the &quot;using&quot; command. Even then , the results were delivered in multiple precision points -> 1.1234, 1.123456 etc.,<p>In R computing an outer product while passing a custom function is easy. Something like outer(x,y, some function of (x,y)) is pretty straight forward. Not sure how to achieve this in Julia.<p>Nevertheless, as the language grows and as more idioms are documented and widely used, lif will be simpler I guess.",1415523212

Possibly the best conditions of any capital in Europe.<p>In recent years, though, it has been hit by gentrification with full force. Traditional everyman&#x27;s quarters are being turned into &quot;luxury living spaces&quot;. Property prices have skyrocketed since rich investors (apparently prominently of Russian origin, but also others) discovered the city. It seems trendy to buy out apartments only to leave them empty most of the year, and only really use them for the occasional visit.<p>In some cases, long-time tenants are actively &quot;encouraged&quot; to give up their apartments so that the owners can either renovate them to a higher standard (which the same tenants couldn&#x27;t afford to pay for) or to tear down the building altogether and build new upscale build complexes.<p>It&#x27;s not surprising that you find Berlin a lot different now than when you first visited.",1415522971

There are some alternatives like HI-FOG, which uses less water and therefore may do less damage to the room&#x27;s equipment.<p>It is very undesirable for the equipment in the room to get wet. A sprinkler activation generally results in partial or total loss of the equipment in the room, and even if you can get stuff running again, it&#x27;s going to take a while. However, it&#x27;s even less desirable for people to die or the building to burn down.<p>Fire suppression systems that operate by removing oxygen from the room (such as Halon) can kill people who are trapped inside. I haven&#x27;t seen a facility with this type of system in a long time.<p>Also, most datacenters have very strict rules about flammable material (like cardboard) on the datacenter floor. Most sites aren&#x27;t super diligent about enforcing it, but just having the rules shifts the blame onto you. Imagine being on the hook financially for tens of thousands of servers because something caught on fire in your cage.",1415520325

It's got some great discussion that's worthwhile for anyone who is making something. Here's a quote:<p><i>Stradivari seems to have carved his violins so the tops and bottoms rang with the same note when tapped -- an F below middle C. But Parker had given up on easy prescriptions. ""Everyone has a secret recipe,"" he said. ""Everyone is trying to do scratch-for-scratch reproductions of ancient instruments. If you had any guts, you'd make a nice new instrument and let the world beat it up for three hundred years."" He lifted the board again, flexed, and tapped. ""You don't get there by secrets,"" he said. ""You get there by doing ~everything~ better.""</i>",1179303261

You write technical essays about engineering or social things, but you never address the people you want working with you. You never write a blog entry that makes you (or any of the other founders) like real  people who also care about those that are not as clever as the ones you pick.<p>So we sit out here on the curb and think - ah, the cool kids are in this lovely clubhouse with their mentor making cool stuff and going to become millionares. While we sit out here watching through the window.<p>All we see now is the business poker face of ycomb. It's no longer Paul giving money to kids to startup, it's a money making entity with a stern - you don't belong here, go away attitude.<p>That's why there is the minor backlash. You are too busy to  talk straight to the normal people, and they resent being left out.<p>What can you do to change this? Try to be less perfect. Appearing vulnerable makes you human, and it makes people empathize with you. Then they make an effort to understand the why of your decisions.",1179302847

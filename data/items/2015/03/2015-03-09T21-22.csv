The librecmc folks are scrambling to find someone who will give away their work for free to host their repository which they give away for free. Except there isn&#x27;t anyone at the moment[1], and so they are nominally forced to shoulder the costs for that or just evaporate.<p>The &quot;strength&quot; of free software is that you have all the code so you <i>can</i> shoulder that cost. But its really painful to bear the costs of your free software that other folks are benefiting from every day, for free. Github seems like a reasonable compromise in this regard.<p>[1] Well not since the acquisition of Gitorius",1425938390

After using AZERTY in France, I remember experimenting with alternative layouts, then preferring the Canadian CSA layout (standard on Macs, PC picture on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACNOR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACNOR</a>) for 2 reasons:
 - it had the accents I needed for french
 - it was QWERTY, which mean no more problems in the BIOS or anything else like grub, lilo etc.
 - it was easy to get - in any Applestore, and also for Thinkpads - even as a replacement part!. Now try to order a mainstream laptop with a Dvorak keyboard.<p>Everybody else around me was still using AZERTY, but it just made sense to switch. I haven&#x27;t looked bad ever since, except I&#x27;m now using the US QWERTY as the accents in the 3rd level (using the control keys for the 3rd level, and caps as a control key) are even easier.<p>Is QWERTY perfectible?

9174434,comment,9172205,9173472,0,0,snowwrestler,,,"I would also highly recommend James Gleick&#x27;s biography of Newton, which spends quite a bit of time on his alchemical work.<p>The short story is that we can look back with the filter of 200+ years of science to appreciate Newton&#x27;s role in the founding of what we know as science today, so we focus on his work in math and physics. But Newton did not have that perspective; he was discovering then, for himself, what we now take for granted. Some of his work produced lasting results, some did not.<p>A much more recent example of a similar effect is the high levels of interest in ESP and mental powers in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. Enormous numbers of very serious and educated scientifically minded people believed that it was possible that we would discover latent powers of the mind. We never did, and today that stuff is largely a punchline among the scientifically minded.<p>To get a sense of this, read &quot;golden age&quot; sci-fi from these decades and see how often mental powers are included. Asimov&#x27;s <i>Foundation</i> series, Larry Niven&#x27;s <i>Known Space</i> series, Heinlein&#x27;s <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i>, Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s <i>Childhood&#x27;s End</i>, and of course Herbert&#x27;s <i>Dune</i> series are just a few examples.",1425937991

9174345,comment,9172048,9172048,0,0,kyzyl,,,"Overall a good article with some insightful points. One thing strikes me as a bit off, though. The recommendation for one or two cores per GPU seems not quite right. Examining only the CPU<->GPU performance, this might be reasonable. Like the author mentions, you can use the other core to prep the next mini-batch and all those sorts of tasks. However, training the model is only one part of the system, and I tend to value the overall performance of the system more than any one facet.<p>For example, despite training on GPUs being very computationally intensive, I find one of the most onerous tasks to be the custom data prep/transformation/augmentation pipeline. Because these types of things are usually pretty application specific, there often isn&#x27;t a ready-made toolkit that does all the heavy lifting for you (unlike the GPU training, which has Torch, Caffe, pylearn, cuda-convnet, lasagne, cxxnet...), so you end up having to roll it yourself. Often you have to run this code often, and with large data that isn&#x27;t trivial. Usually you won&#x27;t invest--at least, I don&#x27;t--in doing custom CUDA code for this type of thing, if it&#x27;s even possible, so having lots of fast CPU cores is a win. I usually write multi-threaded routines for my processing steps and run them on 8-32 cores for huge gains. So my point is that &quot;one or two cores per GPU&quot; is a bit of a narrow recommendation.<p>The same applies if you want to do &#x27;real time&#x27; data augmentation (this is hinted at later in the article) and/or if you want to deploy with CPU only. Sure you need the GPU to do the training in a reasonable amount of time, but once you&#x27;ve fit your model, it might not be worth it to deploy to GPU-enabled computers if all you&#x27;re doing is forward passes.<p>PS: This is also a place where running on EC2 can be a win. Maybe it&#x27;s more economical to build a workstation, but once you&#x27;re in the cloud you can spin up a few 32 core boxes to run your preprocessing really quickly, shut them down and spin up some GPU instances for training, then shut those down and spin up some mid-tier boxes to run the models through a bunch of data without breaking the bank.

That being said, there are a fair few rules that are common to many of these conflicting diet plans that don&#x27;t add up to a comprehensive diet plan but can still be applied to your existing diet.  See the rest of this thread for examples, but it&#x27;s _mostly_ common-sense stuff (that is still widely not-followed) like &quot;limit quickly-absorbed sugar/simple-carb intake&quot;, &quot;eat lots of vegetables&quot;, &quot;eat a hefty amount of good fats (like in fish)&quot;, &quot;eat a fixed amount of protein relative to bodyweight&quot;.

I don&#x27;t eat simple carbs and do eat the occasional dessert but treat like a special occasion that I know is terrible for me (e.g. like drinking 5+ drinks in a night: I&#x27;d be fine not doing at all, I&#x27;m aware that it&#x27;s bad for me, but I don&#x27;t limit myself to NEVER doing it ever).",1425937294

I see the rise of DevOps as coming from realizations about how modern applications are structured and how that&#x27;s incompatible with the way operations used to be done. Think standard n-tier architecture vs a micro-services architecture that auto-scales depending on load.<p>Applications used to run on a fairly static number of instances that were maintained by an operations team. When more capacity was needed, operations would provision new machines. But now, especially with the increasing shift toward the cloud, infrastructure is seen more as something that&#x27;s created programmatically, or even in response to events (load or otherwise) in the network. It&#x27;s a powerful conceptual shift to think of infrastructure as something that isn&#x27;t physical, but is more ephemeral. Just like a process on a server may die, a server on a cloud hosting platform may die. But you can engineer for failure at the infrastructure level the same way that you&#x27;d engineer for failure at the system level.<p>With this change, you can no longer rely on a fleet of sysadmins to manage everything for you. Instead, you rely on scripting everything...&quot;Infrastructure as Code.&quot; You create recipes to create each and every part of your infrastructure and tools to orchestrate everything. Gone are the days where you actually ssh to boxes in a terminal...there are far too many boxes to make this practical. Instead, ssh becomes the protocol that your orchestration uses to communicate with its fleet of machines. Things are much more dynamic and you start to view your infrastructure more holistically rather than as a collection of individual machines.<p>Once you&#x27;ve started to think this way, you realize that neither the traditional development mindset or the traditional operations mindset work in isolation. You need to meld the two together so that operations understands better how to automate everything and development understands more about the environment in which their code will run.",1425937226

9174301,comment,9170179,9170179,0,0,khangsile,,,"Some advice from when I studied for these no more than two months ago:
1. Cracking the Code - get ahold of it and read through it. It &#x27;ll give you all the topics that you should study through and some tricks that are helpful in implementations. You&#x27;ll still need to use other resources in order to know the topics in depth, like I don&#x27;t think it goes too in depth into dynamic programming, but the book does have a large amount of questions and solutions.
2. oj.leetcode.com - This is just a website kind of like how interviewstreet was, and something around 180 problems that are interview style problems. You should be fine if you can do the almost all of the medium or easy level problems and maybe some of the hard ones. For these, I&#x27;d definitely get out a notebook and write out solutions and then throw type them up, to get a feel for how whiteboarding is going to be. 
3. If you&#x27;ve got friends who are in the same position, actual mock interviews in person are an enormous help. I had a couple friends get together, and one of us would do one problem at a time while the rest evaluated them - basically acted like the interviewer.<p>With regards to timeline, I think I started preparing for my first phone interview a week early. The first couple of days were definitely slow, but with 3 days left, I studied for a couple hours each day before. For my first onsite, I found out about oj.leetcode.com about two weeks before and just did those problems almost non-stop for the two weeks leading up. Five days before the onsite, I rounded up some friends and we started doing whiteboard problems for a couple hours each day.<p>I guess preparation time varies by person. I did a little bit of competitive programming before this, so I would say I had a little bit of a head start. However, before this, I probably couldn&#x27;t program a binary search off the top of my head, or approach dynamic programming problems, but now, I can probably handle a decent amount of algorithmimc interview problems. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m pro, but I&#x27;m apparently good enough.",1425936977

At least &quot;cloud&quot; has some semblance of at least meaning &quot;whatever that we used to do in the 90s for IT is BAD&quot; and implies great upheaval, but DevOps is a really, really weak movement in comparison because most companies that are dysfunctional try to contain whatever DevOps is into their existing (typically broken, so let&#x27;s propagate that error 100x, right?) practices.<p>While I agree that sysadmins should be developers first it is increasingly less likely you&#x27;ll find developers willing to become computer janitors and deal with the ugly realities of operations in, for example, larger companies. I wouldn&#x27;t think that John Carmack ever liked having to figure out the installer scripts and keep them working across all the  supported platforms through all the BS that Microsoft and different Linux distributions could throw at you, yet that&#x27;s what a more &quot;ideal&quot; DevOps organization described by many model would have John Carmack do.<p>What should have happened though is that instead of hobbling the John Carmacks and dragging down their productivity, you should have fired the developers that refuse to cooperate with operations and those that keep actively putting off writing &quot;boring&quot; code or never documenting things that do matter for operations to figure out and learn through a failure that something broke. That kind of behavior is the developer equivalent of not being a team player at all. It&#x27;s true that none of these things actually make you a better programmer in itself, but these things are what contribute to making you more PROFESSIONAL instead of a cowboy renegade programmer that doesn&#x27;t care if nobody else can use his code because &quot;clearly, if you can&#x27;t figure it out quickly you don&#x27;t deserve to use it&quot; (not an exaggeration at all I&#x27;ve heard).<p>Having been in both development and operations in rather large (and small!) companies now, I&#x27;d far, far, far rather stay as a hermit-crab developer than deal with the constant dysfunctions of enterprise Faustian nightmares that are required for you to deal with as an operations engineer. You can generally ignore a lot of the noise in a super-siloed off R&D organization, for example, but you cannot ignore your pager going off at 2 am because a random server crashed causing someone to get very, very angry and demand immediate resolution when it is your JOB to keep those things going.

I hate to carry so many dongles and even worse, they are so easy to lose which can be devastating when traveling. I hate even more carryieng external DVD players because running Netflix is too choppy. When I&#x27;m presenting, I hate to carry dongles for VGA, DVI, HDMI etc to connect to projectors. Just few years ago, all of these were built-in to laptops and I used to carry zero dongles.

A naive implementation of Lisp leaks memory very rapidly, and obvious memory management schemes fail. Garbage collection was invented for Lisp to deal with these problems, and even assuming an immature implementation, GC isn&#x27;t trivial. The simplest implementation of mark-and-sweep garbage collection requires a lot of discipline to make sure that objects are correctly allocated so that in-scope objects are kept live and out-of-scope objects are discoverable as dead. Even if you&#x27;re writing your own allocator for C, that allocator is pretty trivial in comparison.",1425935130

Similar argument against including es5-shim - it&#x27;s super easy to add that if/when you need it, but it&#x27;s orthogonal to building a react application.<p>Also, I&#x27;d be wary of incorporating Radium - it will narrow the audience because it brings another set of dev requirements., and it&#x27;s really not <i>Essential</i> to building a react app, it&#x27;s just a nice-to-have <i>if</i> it fits your dev style.<p>Will definitely be interested in trying this out next time I&#x27;m playing with React, though - thanks for sharing it!",1425934932

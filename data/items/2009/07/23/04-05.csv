719082,comment,717982,717982,0,0,mgenzel,,,"I also didn't really enjoy Calculus in high school, only learning to love it in hindsight, when I took Real Analysis in college. Then again, I was always interested in theoretical mathematics (poetry, abstraction, & all that) rather than practical (yucky numbers & approximations :); so maybe pragmatists enjoy Calculus as taught?",1248325038

719078,comment,717982,718273,0,0,mgenzel,,,"Was my favorite subject as well, precisely for those reasons. Not sure how to teach the beauty of mathematics to those who are uninitiated though. I think it really should come in at the elementary school level, when you can show really cool things about numbers like Fibonacci sequence or binary system or simple cryptography, and make mathematics seem magical and cool (and not wait until high school with these concepts, when it's too late to convince most non-predisposed folks of the poetic beauty of mathematics; you can absolutely teach these concepts earlier).",1248324848

719075,comment,718927,719030,0,0,zacman85,,,"Not arbitrary per se. I like having two goals because then I can directly compare the goals when making a decision on what to try to accomplish. It becomes an either-or decision. If I am in the mood to complete something quickly, I can look at both goals and pick the one with the shorter time investment. I actively try to position goals against each other so that they help me stay balanced (e.g. one goal is fitness related, one goal is work related). Having 3 goals tends to introduce too many points of comparison for me.",1248324762

Originally if you slept the CPU, on wakeup the SD card would disappear from the bus, which absolutely fucks you if you were booting off of it. The only fix I found was to add a 1s wait to the wakeup process -- the design target for the entire sleep/wake cycle was <100ms!",1248323247

I want one to detect the genetic makeup of the cold and flu viruses that I acquire.<p>The physicist thinks it would be great to install in public places to detect the virus. I think it would be better to detect if a person had the virus and not let them in the plane or to work at the hospital.<p>I have had an idea for a while about making ultraviolet light air filters and installing them in high risk airborne virus transmission prone buildings ( such as airplanes, airports, subways, hospitals, etc. ). The idea is that the air returned to the environment will be airborne virus free ( and perhaps smell minty ).",1248323046

719055,comment,717982,717982,0,0,10ren,,,"I lost interest in maths in high school when I realized that the problems  we were solving were specifically designed to be solvable with the techniques we were taught. Their generality was specious. This was at an expensive private school, in the so-called advanced maths stream...<p>I much preferred programming, because things made sense there. You could work things out. Even the instruction set for the Z-80 processing I was coding for was more consistent and general than the maths I was taught. The compound instructions were obviously compound, and - and this is the best part - the aspects that I didn't understand enriched me when I finally did understand them (I realized they had machine code support for structs, before I'd heard of structs - I 'invented' structs because my code needed the concept).<p>Today, after bachelor, masters and not-yet-submitted doctorate in Computer Science, the maths I see in papers still seems technique-based rather than about the truth. I use set-builder notation, and grammar notation (regular expression and CFG syntax), but only because it is logically consistent, not because it's ""mathematics"".<p>It seems to me that there isn't any way to learn the true mathematics - the mathematics that is our heritage as human beings - except by the good fortune of finding someone who does understand it, or long and personal study, using historical sources, because these are the only ones that show the point of the techniques - <i>why</i> they are useful.<p>There must be good text books out there, but the ones I've seen either dive into obscure notation, or use inadequate metaphors. Disclaimer: The only maths I took at uni were taught by the engineering dept. Maybe maths taught by the maths department might have helped me. Actually, my very best comp sci lecturer was from the maths dept - he took care to make it logical.",1248322783

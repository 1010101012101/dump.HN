I'm not saying there isn't an answer to that question (I'm also not saying that there <i>is</i>), what I'm saying is that the answer needs to be better communicated before anything is going to change.",1239465422

I talked to him, and he was debugging a problem that came up the night before in the back-end of a gas pump point-of-sale system. He was very cheerful and seemed to love his work. After that I thought about that one nice thing about being a COBOL programmer was that you didn't have to keep up with all of the latest frameworks and standards.",1239465228

557536,comment,141898,141898,0,0,zeusprod,,,"Both Google and Oracle try to use the ""market approach"" with almost no managers cited as a possibility in the article. At Google, it seems to lead to a lot of people with no direction and a lot of projects with inadequate resources. At Oracle, it led to outright warfare between departments and a total lack of cooperation. The difference is that at Google, failing didn't cost you your job. At Oracle, it did. So Googler's were independent but didn't have to compete for scarce resources the way Oracle people did. People seemed like happy lions at Google. They seemed miserable at Oracle, like bands of warring chimps always afraid of being annihilated by those in the next cubicle over.",1239465078

Whenever I got a team ready to be really useful, there would be a bizarre negative reaction from all sorts of other people who were employed within the same organizations, but were not part of the teams I was working with.</i><p>Have you ever been working in one of those organizations and your coworkers goad you into not working so hard?  They say things like, ""You're making us look bad.""  or ""Take the day off early.""<p>Little things like that.  Some have more humor in them than others, but everyone wants to work as little as possible for as much money as possible.  If a super team comes in and makes work look fun and easy and they actually accomplish a lot, it raises the bar for every other team and even individual in the organization.

Here, presumably, everything is on the table. It doesn't involve purposely lying to your spouse as much as it does making arrangements for, er, extra ""services""<p>Not that I would go for anything like this. I've found from watching myself and others that the line between sex and emotional relationship is too blurry for to dance around for a long time.<p>I really wonder who is screwing whom here. Can you have a one-night stand and walk away? Sure. Can you spend tens of thousands of dollars on someone and then walk away? Sure -- it's only money. How about your time? How much of your personal time do you want to spend wooing and chatting up and getting to know somebody who's there only as a sort of human rental car?<p>It's the time investment that doesn't make much sense. If you're paying for sex seems like you drop your cash and badda boom, badda bing the transaction is done. If you're looking for a relationship, you spend your money <i>and time</i> and build a knowledge of somebody. But this is almost like saying ""I'm too insecure to meet people, so I'd just like to pay you and pretend we like each other for a period of time. Then we'll both move on""<p>I'm not buying it. I think these guys have emotional needs they're covering up by rationalizing dating into a business deal. Since their emotional problems aren't going away, and since there will always be young, attractive girls who want more money, it looks like a solid business model.

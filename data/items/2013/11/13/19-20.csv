Why are you <i>so</i> worried about controlling false positives that you&#x27;re willing to eat a whole bunch of false negatives?*<p>You&#x27;re not administering expensive drugs to cancer patients, you&#x27;re designing a website! If you mistakenly think that green buttons perform better than blue buttons when the actual truth is the null hypothesis that they perform the same, that&#x27;s not the end of the world.<p>* and I do mean a whole bunch; in that scenario, moving from alpha=10% to alpha=1% means you increase your false negatives by something like 3x. The power calculations:<p><pre><code>    R> power.prop.test(n=20, p1=0.5, p2=0.25, sig.level=0.10)\n    ...\n              power = 0.4951\n    ...\n    R>\n    R> power.prop.test(n=20, p1=0.5, p2=0.25, sig.level=0.01)\n    ...\n              power = 0.1646\n    ...\n    R>\n    R> 0.4951/0.1646\n    [1] 3.008</code></pre>",1384372777

After some feedback from native & phonegap developers and building a quick prototype with Phonegap we went with native.<p>Basically Phonegap is cool if you want something for both platforms pretty fast and the UI is not too complex (works well for showroom apps for example). However, performance might be an issue (especially since iOS throttles Webkit outsides of safari), and I&#x27;ve heard that you&#x27;d more or less need to use pure JS since existing frameworks (e.g. Sencha) would be too slow. Last thing is that you&#x27;d generally still need to write 5-15% of native code for your app, depending on its complexity (again, haven&#x27;t been far enough but got it from devs who use Phonegap for most of their apps).",1384372692

With a crane, you could pour concrete slabs, cure them, then lift them into place after the concrete cured enough. My dad did that kind of work in the 70&#x27;s in Iran. They had frequent dust storms so they didn&#x27;t make the concrete outside, but built a shed to make the concrete slabs in and then trucked them to the site. I doubt the &#x27;printer&#x27; would be much more efficient than that. You&#x27;d likely still need a crane on-site anyway, and there&#x27;s the problem of not being able to build windows and doorways with it, which if you poured the slab on the ground you most certainly would be able to do.<p>The rest of the stuff has pretty much been in real world use for the past 20 years, so nothing really that would be &quot;world changing&quot;.

Released it as an MVP to the App Store. I wrote the Android version as well and released it (but went native android because I knew it).I eventually wanted to upgrade some features on my iOS app (Xamarin). I tried finding contractors to do it, and the lowest I could find at the time were around 90/hr. While I could find great iOS devs for half of that. I ended up having an iOS dev re-write the app in Obj-C for much cheaper than it would have been to add new features to the old Xamarin app.<p>Moral of the story - The idea is great. But the problem is that no one knows how to use Xamarin and those that do charge a premium. If the app is native you can find many more qualified devs that know how to code for the platform at a much more affordable price. All my apps are native now. No more Xamarin.<p>I loved the product, but from the business side it didnt make sense financially for me to continue to go down that road. Worked great to prove the MVP though.",1384372046

6727905,comment,6708800,6709129,1,0,loverde,,,">>Java in the 90s was a spectacular con job that millions of developers and managers bought hook, line, and sinker<p>In the 90s, before Java, you had C/C++ dominating server based code that wasn&#x27;t COBOL (Smalltalk tried to compete, but it&#x27;s failure is a whole different story), with BASIC/Delphi/PowerBuilder/OracleForms/arguablyMFC dominating UI based code.<p>I will grant that Java gained a lot of buzz due to Java Applets in the browser and with deceptive claims regarding how portable AWT and later Swing applications were.  But for server side business application coding (NOT systems coding), Java blew C/C++ out of the water.<p>C++ on large projects, especially with the feeble template compilers at the time, had insanely long compile/link times.  It wasn&#x27;t unusual to kick off a build and have to wait an hour or more to be able to test it.  It&#x27;s true you could break things up into dynamic libraries to try to reduce link times, but that meant more work, especially if you had to run on different platforms.  And there were specialized tools like ClearCase&#x27;s ClearMake that could speed things up, but they were far from commonplace.<p>Java for server based code compiled quickly and eliminated the link times (well, it moved linking to runtime, but effectively it also made each class into it&#x27;s own mini shared library).  And Java stack dumps were orders of magnitude more useful than C/C++ core dumps.  Performance was slower compared to C/C++, but faster than interpreted languages at the time, and generally &quot;fast enough&quot; for most business applications.<p>Java&#x27;s JDK also provided a lot more &quot;out of the box&quot; functionality than what you had with the C++.  Heck, even just having a standard String class was tremendously more useful than having to deal with char arrays.  And the collection library was feeble, but it was there.  (The C++ STL wasn&#x27;t released until 1998, and RogueWave was probably the closest thing to a de facto C++ library, but it was a commercial product).<p>The rise of internet e-commerce also convened to help Java out.  A lot of sites started with cgi-scripts, which had to launch a new process for every CGI request.  Even C/C++ CGI programs were slow because of this.  Java&#x27;s servlet spec provided a very convenient way to run multiple requests in a single process, which was typically at least an order of magnitude faster than CGI at the time.  And it was much easier to write servlets than to compile a custom Apache C/C++ module into your apache distribution.<p>And for as many headaches as Java caused for &quot;cross platform&quot; UI code, it actually worked pretty well for cross platform server side code.  Gone were the spaghetti pragmas from cross platform C/C++ code.<p>So what happened with Java is that the applet/UI buzz got in through the enterprise door, but it&#x27;s server side conveniences are what enabled it to gain tremendous enterprise acceptance.  And IBM jumping on board the Java ship was somewhat of a green light for COBOL shops to move to something else that was still blessed by IBM.<p>>>  XML was pretty big back then, too<p>XML really didn&#x27;t come about until the late 90s and was really more of a 2000s buzzard.

Prior to developing this consumer device, we developed a medical one that uses some of the same core technology and is actually being used at more than 30 of the nation&#x27;s top hospitals in clinical research. The Skulpt Aim, however, is not intended to diagnose any medical condition. It&#x27;s the first device on the market that will allow you to measure your fat percentage and muscle quality on any part of your body.<p>Regarding your second question, muscle quality (MQ) is a measure of strength and definition. There is a high correlation between MQ and normalized strength (i.e. strength over weight), meaning that someone smaller with strong muscles for their size can have a similar MQ to someone larger with stronger muscles, but two people who are about the same size and strength will have similar MQs. Also, similar to your IQ, the average person has an MQ of 100 for each muscle and a pretty fit person will have MQ scores of 120-140 or even higher.",1384371860

Although the cutoff point will be more rough in a smaller sample, it&#x27;s a good standard practice to round conservatively to account for this.<p>10% is unlikely to be considered a good result for statistics in either case - you can engineer a result by doing 10 tests on nothing and there&#x27;s a danger you would have unknowingly or unconsciously done this, maybe (for example) by not deciding the sample size in advance. However, there&#x27;s also presumably strong enough evidence against a harmful difference that you aren&#x27;t likely to lose anything by following these results.<p>It can be good idea to do numerous small investigative tests as justification for bigger tests - relying on lots of small tests alone requires consideration for multiple testing (e.g. Bonferroni correction).",1384371377

Although it is an appropriate summary, it can easily be taken out of context. Van Roy and Haridi, authors of CTMCP, were mainly concerned with the trade-offs of programming paradigms. They observed that functional languages, like Haskell, and object-oriented/shared-state-concurrency languages, like Java, sit at opposite ends of a continuum. The functional paradigm is very easy to formally reason with, but can be very kludgy when expressing certain real world concepts, like state. The OO paradigm and the shared-state concurrency paradigm, on the other hand, are very powerful and expressive, but can be quite a pain to reason over. Van Roy and Haridi believed that programmers, rather than having to make a boolean decision between the two, should be allowed to work anywhere on the continuum, and they designed the Oz programming language to make that easy to do.<p>CTMCP is the bible for Oz. But it&#x27;s more than just a language reference book. It is an exploration of this trade-off between language expressiveness and ease of comprehension. CTMCP outlines how programming concepts can be layered to form gradual steps between functional and OO languages by controlling the use of mutable state. The Oz language like Haskell, starts in a functional paradigm and makes the use of state explicit, but unlike Haskell it also tries to make the use of state easy and intuitive, rather than overly verbose. CTMCP advocates an avoidance of using a single paradigm to solve all problems.<p>Oz also has concurrency built in natively, and one of the overarching themes of CTMCP is that the use of concurrency greatly benefits from an understanding of this trade-off between expressiveness and ease of comprehension. Concurrency doesn&#x27;t have to be difficult, and in the case of functional languages (think dataflow concurrency, as seen in Unix pipes) can  be quite easy to use and comprehend. CTMCP posits that as one moves from functional to OO, concurrency analogously becomes both more expressive and more difficult to formally reason over. The use of concurrency therefore can become more tractable when programmers are made more aware of these trade-offs.<p>(CTMCP actually goes further and classifies the programming paradigms into an elaborate branching hierarchy, as can be seen here <a href=""http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/paradigmsDIAGRAMeng108.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/paradigmsDIAGRAMeng108.pdf</a>)",1384370958

PHP is a pain in my ass, I yield to almost no one in my visceral contempt for PHP, but PHP is not my <i>problem</i>, and it hasn&#x27;t been for a long time.<p>What we can do, with a reasonable investment of time and energy, is move more of our business concerns into a more rigorous data store, and explore building new features against the data we model well using other languages and tools.  Right now we&#x27;ve got various bits of tooling written in (at least) Ruby, Go, C, Perl, R, Python, and Node.js.  Maybe someday we&#x27;ll really zone in on something and figure out that it&#x27;s a good time to start slicing off chunks of application and rebuilding them in [better language x] until the PHP has evaporated.  Maybe we&#x27;ll decide that everything should live in [third party system x].  Maybe we won&#x27;t bother with any of this, because PHP gets a little less heinous with each passing release, we already know what we&#x27;re doing with it, and there are bigger fish to fry.<p>Reasoning by analogy is frequently suspect anyway, but in your picture, I&#x27;m not sure how databases are barn doors.  They tend, at least for the kinds of things we&#x27;re doing, to be much more fundamental to the framing of the barn.  Or maybe they&#x27;re the stuff stashed in the hayloft.  I dunno.  At any rate, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s super coherent to argue that all the things must be fixed at once in order to justify improving one of the things.",1384370777

6727601,comment,6726260,6726260,7,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> The DSP pool is egalitarian, shared equally amongst the first fifteen employees we hire. So its a rich incentive at 1 percent of the company (before any future dilution).<p>The fact that the author considers 1% of a startup&#x27;s illiquid equity pre-dilution to be a &quot;rich incentive&quot; highlights just how much rethinking is required.<p>For argument&#x27;s sake, lets assume an early-stage startup has no future dilution and five of the first 15 employees leave before a liquidity event. In 2012, over half of startups exits were $50 million or less. With a $50 million exit, the 10 early employees would each receive $750,000 pre-tax from the DSP pool. Even with a $100 million exit, each employee&#x27;s DSP pool share is not likely to net $1 million after taxes.<p>Of course, at a typical venture-backed startup, dilution is likely to be meaningful, liquidity preferences can prevent employees from receiving <i>anything</i> at all and the odds are against a $50 to $100 million exit ever occurring. Experienced and/or savvy employees know this, and they can do basic math. So it shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise that early-stage startup equity is generally a poor retention tool. It&#x27;s like using a screwdriver with a nail instead of a hammer.<p>Retention requires a sustained effort to keep employees happy on a daily basis. This is usually best accomplished with financial tools that provide for near-term, recurring rewards such as bonus and profit sharing packages, as well as non-financial tools (pre-tax benefits, flexible schedules, etc.).",1384370055

Yes, those people have a lot of money, but if we assume they pledged 10K and no more for their rewards, then they account for just one quarter of one percent of Torment&#x27;s funds. The real pillars of the campaign were pledges in the $20-$28 range. Almost 38,000 backers signed on at that level, and their pledges totaled more than $900,000.

6727560,comment,6726939,6727020,96,0,gruseom,,,"It is hard to figure out! I&#x27;ve taken it from the airport to Mountain View many times. First you need the airport train to the BART station. That&#x27;s easy enough, once you see the signs telling you how to get there. They don&#x27;t tell you which train is which, but if you get on the wrong one all that happens is you go the wrong way through all the airport terminals. Once you&#x27;re at BART, you have to figure out how to buy a BART ticket (not that hard, only half a dozen steps or so) and how to use it to get admitted into the station. Various people will be doing the latter (you insert your ticket one place and then it opens a turnstile and pops the ticket out and you grab the ticket again. Don&#x27;t forget to grab your damn ticket!) so hopefully you can just copy them.<p>Now things advance a level. Your BART train may be sitting there, but the doors will be closed. People are sitting inside--how did they get there?--but you can&#x27;t get in. Expect this bizarre situation to last for about ten minutes, and just act cool like the locals. Eventually the doors will probably open; that was just to throw you off a bit. You&#x27;re on BART! Ok. You must get off at Millbrae because that&#x27;s where Caltrain is.<p>Surprise! BART doesn&#x27;t necessarily stop at Millbrae. Sometimes you must go past it to San Bruno, then cross the aisle and catch a different BART back to Millbrae. The conductor is supposed to tell you so, but often is too indifferent to bother; that doesn&#x27;t matter, though, because BART&#x27;s PA system is so old and ratty that you wouldn&#x27;t be able to hear it anyway. What you&#x27;d hear is &quot;shbluwarmillblahcalshulb&quot;. If by some twist the intercom started working, you might not understand, because the conductors are bored and like to read the script as unintelligibly as they can. So make sure you&#x27;re an expert in the right American accent. Anyway, now that you&#x27;re going the other way on BART from San Bruno, you get off at Millbrae.<p>Now you have to figure out how to get out of the BART station. That&#x27;s almost the same as how you got in--you insert the ticket and then it pops out and you take it and it lets you through, unless you paid exactly, in which case the ticket doesn&#x27;t pop out but does let you through, or unless you didn&#x27;t pay enough, in which case it pops out but doesn&#x27;t let you through. In <i>that</i> case you have to find and figure out the machine that lets you add enough money to the ticket to get let out of BART. That&#x27;s not quite the same process as the one by which you bought the ticket in the first place, but the learning curve is similar so you may enjoy it a bit better.<p>Congratulations, you&#x27;re out of BART. Your next mission is to figure out where the Caltrain platform is. It&#x27;s nearby, haha, but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s easy to get to! I&#x27;ve wandered around looking for it for ages. You have to go up the correct escalator and down the correct staircase; there are perhaps a dozen to choose from. And make sure you end up on the <i>correct</i> platform, because otherwise your Caltrain is going to take you to San Francisco, which is not Mountain View at all. It&#x27;s far from obvious which platform is which, especially since after working your way through the maze I&#x27;ve described so far, you will have zero orientation as to which way is north. You want south. Actually what you want is &quot;San Jose&quot;, because that&#x27;s where the Caltrain you want is going. <i>You</i> don&#x27;t want San Jose, but San Jose is the way to Mountain View. Fortunately you knew that.<p>Now buy a Caltrain ticket. That involves figuring out which of several &quot;zones&quot; you want to go to, each of which is a list of names that mostly mean nothing to you but one of which, you&#x27;ll eventually discover, includes Mountain View. Then do another simple half a dozen steps to pay and get your ticket. Edit: but don&#x27;t miss the demonic detail kindly outlined by ghshephard below, unless it pleases you to figure out the hard parts yourself.<p>The machine will spit out two tickets, though. One is your receipt, which you probably don&#x27;t need, and the other is your ticket, which you certainly do. Don&#x27;t make the mistake of keeping the wrong one; if you do... that&#x27;s an exercise to the reader. Now you&#x27;re ready for the train. Oh, one passed by while you were trying to find your damn platform and buy your damn ticket, but don&#x27;t worry: another will be along in an hour.<p>Make sure it stops where you want to get off, though. If it&#x27;s an <i>express</i> train, it may blaze right through that stop, in which case you&#x27;ll be backtracking on a train for the second time today! (I have made this mistake.) However, you&#x27;re going to Mountain View and I believe the express trains all do stop there. Better double-check, though. But there won&#x27;t be any signs on the platform telling you which trains stop where. You might try to look it up on your phone, but there won&#x27;t be any internet access, so be aware which arm or leg you may pay for roaming data; also, roaming data is often so painfully slow as to be unusable, and the Caltrain schedule if you do find it will be a pdf you have to download. On the bright side, this gives you something to do during your hour waiting for the next train.<p>Once it comes, you&#x27;ll get on, but since you&#x27;re coming from the airport you probably have luggage, and that means you probably want The Luggage Car, which is usually in the middle of the train and has a rack you can put your suitcase onto. Since you don&#x27;t know that, be sure to be magically positioned so that that car happens to stop in front of you and you happen to see a little sign that says &quot;Luggage Car&quot; to the side of the doors. If you suck at being magically positioned, lug your luggage through the aisle of one of the other cars and hope that you find a couple of adjacent seats and that someone doesn&#x27;t come along who needs the seat so you have to take your suitcase off it. Failing that, sit with your suitcase on your lap.<p>Finally, be aware that the stop you want to pay attention to is not Mountain View, where you&#x27;re going, but San Antonio, the one right before it. Because once the train leaves San Antonio you&#x27;ll be wanting to begin maneuvering yourself and your suitcase near an exit. Those doors don&#x27;t stay open very long! If you wait to hear &quot;Mountain View&quot; before you start the maneuver (Caltrain announcements do tend to be audible and intelligible, mostly), you may find that the thirty seconds or so that you have before the doors close again are insufficient to get you and your suitcase off the train, in which case, welcome to Sunnyvale! Don&#x27;t worry, though; all you were doing was going to meet PG at Y Combinator to talk about your startup. Sunnyvale&#x27;s nice too, and you saved money on a cab.<p>I&#x27;ve grown fond of Caltrain since then but will forever empathize with beginners.<p>Edit: Fine, I added whitespace, but if you&#x27;re going through that process for the first time, don&#x27;t think <i>you&#x27;ll</i> get any whitespace. :)",1384369732

It is interesting the author hints that:<p>> It drops further when asked to allocate 8MiB stacks like C is doing<p>Memory, just like CPU is constrained and costs money especially if provisioned in the cloud. If I have 2G of memory available I can spawn 250 threads and keep them around without swapping.<p>EDIT: actually scratch the above, _wmd pointed out that stack memory is just like virtual memory, it is allocated but brought into physical memory as needed.<p>This changes how code is written. It is not just an internal detail! Now you cannot think &quot;one-connection = one-task&quot; now it is about locks, queues and mapping control blocks to connections. That is the biggest loss.<p>> GC is great for multi-threading, but not so great for hundreds of gigabytes of variable lifetime objects. Even if the GC can handle it, GC still has unacceptable 2x space overhead<p>Good point on GC. I see the main issues in a large concurrent system (and presumably Rust wants to be a good tool for concurrent systems) is non-blocking GC. A slow GC might be acceptable, but if one errant task allocated memory in certain pattern and GC has to lock all the tasks out to run, that could be a serious issue.<p>Responsiveness (liveliness) of a concurrent system is something that is often forgotten and everyone wants to talk about how fast one can transpose a matrix.<p>Now a concurrent GC is possible, Azul built one, for Java, it is very interesting how it work.

Malda even talks about how it&#x27;s been replaced by other sites, but it didn&#x27;t have to be.  Want to be perceived as an old site?  Look the same as you did a decade ago.  Name a successful interface that is practically unchanged for a decade that is not in decline.

Im not really sure what problem having the government pay for college tuition would solve. It would probably just exacerbate the current problem of colleges having no incentive to keep costs down as long as people are dead-set on getting a degree regardless of the costs or lack of benefit.<p>I think a better solution than basically throwing fuel on the fire is to educate people about what their options are to help them make sound economic decisions, including different degree options and their value in the job market, and also about options if they choose not to go to college, since a lot of college graduates end up taking jobs they dont need degrees for. There also needs to be a reversal in the trend of employers requiring college degrees as a form of signaling; I think evidence suggests that college admissions boards arent really any better at predicting student success than results from intelligence tests like the SAT. Its going to be very politically controversial to convince people that a lot of the value associated with having a college degree is actually just in being a smart person, but I think it would make the economy hugely more efficient and save people from having to go to college just to signal their intelligence. Another big part of the solution, for those who do actually need to learn things and earn licenses, is going to be legitimizing and popularizing new forms of education made possible by technology, e.g. MOOCs, and somehow setting more efficient methods of credentialing to go with.",1375940683

It&#x27;s a &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; problem: if anyone can hit a &quot;clone chair&quot; button for zero cost, few would pay to sustain enough professional chair makers.<p>You contradict yourself once here.  You say capitalism is based on what can be withheld.  Another word for that might be scarcity.  In 1932 Lionel Robbins said &quot;Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.&quot; This is still the modern mainstram definition of capitalism.<p>Then you say:
> if anyone can hit a &#x27;clone chair&#x27; button for zero cost, few would pay to sustain enough professional chair makers<p>The idea that value comes from the labor of chair makers is a Marxist idea.  You are making a Marxist argument here.  It also contradicts your first argument.  You say value comes from scarcity (modern mainstream economists agree), then you say value comes from labor (which is what Marx said) which contradicts the first argument.<p>You&#x27;re trying to make a Marxist argument for capitalism (Actually Marx did make an argument for capitalism - he said it was better than feudalism and slavery, but that&#x27;s not what I mean here).<p>You should go on the web and read about the subjective theory of value, and then about the labor theory of value.  You argue STV in the first sentence and then LTV in the second.  They can not both be right, their definition of value is contradictory.<p>I should note you&#x27;re not the first person I see making this error.  As things become digital they lose their scarcity.  I see all kinds of odd statements come out of this.  You&#x27;re not alone in this.  But across the entire political spectrum, from far left to far right, all serious students of the economy agree only one side can be right, value comes from either subjective marginal/scarce/utility reasons or from a certain type of labor, but it is either one or the other.  You flip back and forth between a capitalist-supporting argument and a Marxist argument.  A Marxist argument for capitalism.  I see this more and more, and I find it odd.",1375939169
6177453,comment,6150773,6176472,1,0,saraid216,,,"> Like I said, I&#x27;m fine with discussing ideals, and exploring the full range of possibilites that we might aspire to, but let&#x27;s at least clear up semantic ambiguity by not using the same words that already refer to extant things to also refer to idealized hypotheticals.<p>Then let&#x27;s talk about ideals, because re-iterating the last few thousand repetitions of HN Snowden-the-hero is going to bore me pretty quickly.<p>> And, I&#x27;ve got to wonder: if some institution is indeed somehow speaking for all of humanity, who could they possibly be speaking to?<p>There are several groups. The most obvious is the hypothetical alien culture. The other is ourself: past, present, and future. I hope, for instance, that we&#x27;ll one day look at our history of space flight by trimming back on the competitive Cold War motivations and just call it different groups making attempts towards the achievement. That kind of reframing is useful and inspiring.<p>The institution is a platform for such speech. Arguably, the closest thing we have to that right now is YouTube.<p>> Again, every particular grouping of people is a society unto itself; the actual participants in a business transactions are the ones involved in that social context, which has nothing to do with the religious congregation (unless the religious congregation is trading with them, anyway).<p>This is a logically cogent notion, but it&#x27;s not borne out in reality. Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s two persons who have some relation, friends or enemies or whatever. These two people might (1) be in the same family, (2) work in the same business, and (3) attend the same church.<p>By your model, any disagreements that arise between them would be settled between them. But this is only how it happens in ideal cases. Real people often use their shared contexts as proxies for their disagreements. Estrangement, office politics, religious condemnation: these can all be motivated by such a smaller upset. For every particular grouping of people, you have the possibility of such spillage occurring. The &quot;culture war&quot; that you decried upthread, even if you stripped away all legislative efforts from it, is a demonstration of exactly this kind of spillage.<p>By your dislike of the legislative model, I find it hard to believe that you&#x27;d support larger social contexts imposing upon smaller social contexts, such as a religious group or business specifying the relationship between two persons. Yet such downward pressure is the only way, aside from a magical blessing of maturity, that larger social contexts can protect themselves from spillage from smaller ones. And this is assuming a model of the world where everyone exists in a perfect hierarchy.<p>This seems like a good time to bring in the problem of a third party observer.<p>If you&#x27;re out on a walk and you see imminent murder, I&#x27;d say that you have an obligation to intervene, assuming no mitigating circumstances. Would you consider that a case of law being manifested right there? That seems a little bit too fast and loose for me: it justifies any and every action, as long as no one objects when the dust settles. That isn&#x27;t law in any sense of the word, common or otherwise.<p>> As I mentioned earlier, we have many centuries of effective use of common law and equity as evidence that such a system works quite well; the experiment with supplanting law with legislated policy over the past century hasn&#x27;t worked out quite so well<p>Can you be more specific about the references you&#x27;re making here? Who has been using common law and equity, which centuries, when and how do you pinpoint the beginning of legislated policy? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to fully appreciate your arguments even with answers to these questions, but I&#x27;d at least have some context with which to Google.<p>> because the ideology of democracy was successfuly leveraged to justify exercise of power, instead of regarded as a mechanism to constrain power.<p>But if we posit that no state exists, whose power are we constraining? The typical construction of democracy that talks about &quot;constraining power&quot; usually presumes a distinct state/gov&#x27;t: a subset of the population that exercises power over the entirety. But in our ideal imaginings, there doesn&#x27;t exist such a state. What then democracy?<p>Thought experiment: let&#x27;s say we are gods and have the power to package up a bunch of ideas and that package is called democracy. We magick up ourselves some humans on an Earth-like that we made, and then download the package into their brains. Can they create, or even aspire to create, a democratic society? Should they? I say yes, as that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m packaging up my bundle.<p>> not the maximization of universal participation in politics.<p>I&#x27;d wager this is because the notion of participating in politics leaves a bad taste in your mouth. It does mine. But everyone has always participated in politics. This is where we&#x27;ll likely get into a disagreement over definitions again. You mention earlier that every particular grouping of people is its own society with its own manifested law. I contend that the process of manifesting this law is politics.<p>As such, &quot;man is a political animal&quot;. From this, I think you can deduce why I&#x27;d want to maximize <i>active</i> participation in politics: the alternative is passive participation.<p>> For me, the fundamental goal of politics ought to be the maximization of human freedom,<p>Alright. Here&#x27;s a scary statement for you: I don&#x27;t believe in freedom. I don&#x27;t find it to be a meaningful concept on its own. To make a pop culture reference, &quot;Free from what?&quot; &quot;Freedom.&quot; (The answer is the villain&#x27;s, in <i>The Avengers</i>, if you haven&#x27;t seen it.)<p>You can&#x27;t maximize freedom, because freedom isn&#x27;t merely unquantifiable, it&#x27;s an idea that can&#x27;t stand alone. You can have freedoms to do, freedoms to be, and you can have freedoms from this, freedoms from that, but you can&#x27;t just have &quot;freedom&quot;. Loki (the villain noted above) proposes the project of maximizing human freedom from the stress of decision-making; I can&#x27;t imagine you agree with that.<p>Which leaves us with the question... <i>which</i> human freedoms do you want to maximize? As noted in my link, I like Nussbaum&#x27;s Ten Central Capabilities as a minimum; not something to maximize, but a threshold that we need to cross.",1375939139

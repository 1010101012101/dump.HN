6487946,comment,6486991,6487580,33,0,menage,,,"(Original cgroups developer here, although I&#x27;ve since moved on from Google and don&#x27;t have time to play an active role anymore.)<p>It&#x27;s true that cgroups are a complex system, but they were developed to solve a complex group of problems (packing large numbers of dynamic jobs on servers, with some resources isolated, and some shared between different jobs). I think that pretty much all the features of cgroups come either from real requirements, or from constraints due to the evolution of cgroups from cpusets.<p>Back when cgroups was being developed, cpusets had fairly recently been accepted into the kernel, and it had a basic process grouping API that was pretty much what cgroups needed. It was much easier politically to get people to accept an evolution of cpusets into cgroups (in a backward-compatible way) than to introduce an entirely new API.  With hindsight, this was a mistake, and we should have pushed for a new (binary, non-VFS) API, as having to fit everything into the metaphor of a filesystem (and deal with all the VFS logic) definitely got in the way at times.<p>If you want to be able to manage/tweak/control the resources allocated to a group after you&#x27;ve created the group, then you need <i>some</i> way of naming that group, whether it be via a filesystem directory or some kind of numerical identifier (like a pid). So I don&#x27;t think a realistic resource management system can avoid that.<p>The most common pattern of the need for a process being in multiple cgroups is that of a data-loader/data-server job pair. The data-loader is responsible for periodically loading/maintaining some data set from across the network into (shared) memory, and the data-server is responsible for low-latency serving of queries based on that data. So they both need to be in the same cgroup for memory purposes, since they&#x27;re sharing the memory occupied by the loaded data.  But the CPU requirements of the two are very different - the data-loader is very much a background/batch task, and shouldn&#x27;t be able to steal CPU from either the data-server or from any other latency-sensitive job on the same machine. So for CPU purposes, they need to be in separate cgroups. That (and other more complex scenarios) is what drives the requirement for multiple independent hierarchies of cgroups.<p>Since the data-loader and data-server can be stopped/updated/started independently, you need to be able to launch a new process into an existing cgroup. It&#x27;s true that the need to be able to move a process into a different cgroup would be much reduced if there was an extension to clone() to allow you to create a child directly in a different set of cgroups, but cpusets already provided the movement feature, and extending clone in an intrusive way like that would have raised a lot of resistance, I think.",1380793867

6487928,comment,6486333,6486888,1,0,nkurz,,,"We are likely starting from different points. I see a media that almost universally amplifies the hype of scientific press releases, and I&#x27;m overjoyed to see an article that (I feel) critically examines the details.  Perhaps my bias against &quot;science by press release&quot; is so strong that I don&#x27;t even register the attempts to exonerate Harkonen.<p><pre><code>  And if lots of other scientists are similarly
  cherrypicking their data and making misleading statements
  about it, then I&#x27;d say we have a serious problem on our
  hands.
</code></pre>
I feel this is where we are at, with Harkonen&#x27;s approach almost at the middle of the road.  This isn&#x27;t to imply his behaviour is acceptable, just that we have a very serious problem.  Have you read John Ioannidis&#x27; essay &quot;Why Most Published Research Findings Are False&quot;?  
<a href=""http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal...</a><p><pre><code>  At the very least, we see no evidence that Harkonen was
  doing this to save lives -- a point the author strongly
  and repeatedly implies throughout the article.
</code></pre>
I guess I didn&#x27;t see that message as strongly as you.  I felt it was granted that he had a strong vested interest:<p><pre><code>  The prosecutors also emphasized that Harkonen had a
  financial motive for spinning the study in the most
  positive way. This wasnt hard to find. The third
  paragraph of the press release said: We believe these
  results will support use of Actimmune and lead to peak
  sales in the range of $400-$500 million per year,
  enabling us to achieve profitability in 2004 as planned.
</code></pre>
But you are right that this wasn&#x27;t emphasized.  I think for me the hard point is trying to understand the boundary between ethics and law.  I worry that asking a lay jury to decide guilt based on the contextual interpretation of p-values isn&#x27;t going to end well.<p>I also wonder to what extent Harkonen was optimistically self-delusional versus blatantly fraudulent.  I presume that as well as desiring financial success, he truly hoped he had found a useful cure for a dread disease. Along that lines, I recently read a great article by a 1930&#x27;s Nobel Prize winner entitled &quot;Pathological Science&quot; on how even good scientists can occasionally fool themselves into seeing results that just aren&#x27;t there: <a href=""http://yclept.ucdavis.edu/course/280/Langmuir.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yclept.ucdavis.edu/course/280/Langmuir.pdf</a><p>If the blurriness is too much, there is a good summary here:

Let&#x27;s go through them:<p>1. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t have merge tracking.&quot; That was true at one point: manual merge tracking was indeed a miserable, error-prone experience. But automatic merge tracking was introduced five years ago, so this criticism is no longer relevant.<p>2. &quot;You have to see everyone&#x27;s experimental branches.&quot; This is not so: you can use any directory hierarchy you like, so you can cordon off experimental branches any way you want. A common workflow is to have a directory per engineer, in which case you don&#x27;t see their private branches until you go poking around in their directory. And storing private branches on the server (where they get backed up) can only be a good thing.<p>3. &quot;git better handles sending patches around through uniquely identifiable revisions.&quot; Here &quot;uniquely identifiable&quot; means across separate repositories. This is only relevant in a truly distributed system, where there really is no central server containing the truth. For the truly distributed case, git is clearly to be preferred. But most teams really do use a central server. Like github!<p>Overall, I think the answer is: it doesn&#x27;t matter much. git and svn in their modern forms are both very powerful and capable tools. There&#x27;s a few cases where one excels the other: git is better if you have multiple repositories, while svn is better if you have a large quantity of images or binary files. But for most teams, either tool is more than adequate, and it comes down to experience or personal taste.",1380791409

Funny, though, the first thing I noticed: There are a TON of small issues in the website design that should be fixed (at least in FF3 on mac), and the poor attention to detail in the website makes me skeptical of the company as a whole.

The 'bit flags' are easily understandable, but they don't 'feel' like a Javascript API -> I think that was the point of the post.  All things being equal, jresig's proposed API feels a lot more natural to a javascript developer.  In another language, this API may fit right in.",1245441394
665735,story,,,7,14,JoelMcCracken,"Ask HN: Universal libraries?",,"I have been somewhat fascinated recently with the idea of creating a universal library system. Essentially, the idea is to create library code in an extremely simple programming language (a high-level, assembly-like language?), and then write an interpreter for whatever languages that want to interface with the languages.<p>I realize that there may be quite a bit of naivety in this.<p>Problems I see:<p>1) speed vs writing a custom library. I am not sure exactly how to characterize this, but I can imagine (possibly) the hit being constant time, and not terribly high.<p>2) Interpreter-writing ability. How hard would it actually be to write these interpreters in various languages?<p>3) algorithm creation. People don't like writing things in assembly, and algorithms, by their nature, are hard.<p>Besides the assembly, alternatively a very simple lispy language could be created -- eval is widely known, and this does provide at least some support for higher-level constructs.<p>Is this a realistic project idea? Would it be useful? Does such a thing already exist? Am I insane? Any feedback is welcome.",1245441185

Once care givers responded to the transparency, prices would drop. Additionally, individuals would be able to determine the level of risk associated with purchasing more affordable high deductible insurance.

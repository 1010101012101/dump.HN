It is a privileged argument, it is an argument from one of privilege. You are no better a person than any other drug dealer and your education does not give you a special place of privilege in our criminal justice system. It makes it less explicable why you did what you did.&quot;<p>You can argue that our drug laws are wrong or the punishments are too extreme, but singling out Ulbrich for the specifics ways in which he clearly and repeatedly violated those laws is showing favoritism.  If his crimes didn&#x27;t involve the Internet, there would be nothing newsworthy about his arrest and sentencing.",1444082393

(There&#x27;s always LinkedIn for work...)<p>Another thing I see a lot in Germany are (heavily) abbreviated names, so that all your friends know who you are in their stream, but stalkers/your boss cannot find you as easily.

10335294,comment,10334288,10334288,0,0,chimeracoder,,,"Okay, so I&#x27;m not going to criticize Ulbricht&#x27;s sentencing, because (a) it&#x27;s hard to make a case to go easy on him, and (b) I don&#x27;t really care enough about Ulbricht in particular.<p>But from a drug policy perspective, this language jumps out at me:<p>> Ulbricht’s defense had argued the site reduced harm because it kept drug deals off the streets and allowed users to share information about drug safety. The transcript from the final day of court proceedings shows how Forrest categorically rejected that claim, outlining the social costs of drug use from an individual level to mass scale. “The social costs of drugs are manifest,” she said. “The user is only one part of the equation, that is where much of this harm reduction argument comes from and it is focused on the user. The user is one part of a massive, massive worldwide scheme of drug trafficking and if you sat where I sat you would see that the user is not the end… So, harm reduction focused on the user is missing the point.”<p>First, let&#x27;s make the assumption that all those users would have obtained the drugs some other way without the Silk Road. In that case, all that trafficking cost that happens before the seller lists the drug on the market<i>still</i> would have occurred. Silk Road was just as responsible for that cost as the end user[0].<p>Now, let&#x27;s make the assumption that all those users would <i>not</i> have obtained the drugs some other way. That&#x27;s basically saying that trafficking - which is an avoidable cost - is what makes the Silk Road so egregious. In that case, the right action is to address the drug trafficking trade itself. Again, Silk Road had only a small role in that. If we fixed the issues with drug trafficking, perhaps we would have a very different kind of marketplace than what Silk Road was (with a very different kind of person running it).<p>In case it&#x27;s not obvious by this point, I think the drug war is pretty backwards. I don&#x27;t really have any sympathy for Ulbricht or the Silk Road, but I&#x27;m also not impressed by the judge&#x27;s arguments in this sentencing.<p>[0] this is not counting, of course, Ulbricht&#x27;s own actions (e.g. attempting to hire an assassin).",1444082291

So, I just find it really hard to find answers to specific questions - like you might naturally do when programming to get a problem fixed quickly.<p>That said, it&#x27;s super flexible and might be worth a look.

If you ask the question &quot;Will all the news organizations and publishers go out of business?&quot; And the answer is obvious, no they won&#x27;t.<p>The reason they won&#x27;t is because there is a demand for content and the only people left standing will be the ones who can deliver content in a way that pays their own bills. Will the NYTimes go out of business? Perhaps.<p>This is the fallacy in a nutshell : <i>&quot;My current thinking is that if they were to stop writing, people would just get their news from elsewhere, and other publishers would gladly fill their shoes.&quot;</i><p>Nobody will commit finanical suicide to serve a market. They have to believe that there is a way to make money at it, so the only way &quot;other publishers&quot; jump into the market is if they can do so without losing their shirts.<p>What we&#x27;re observing is the death of the &quot;put up some content and slap some ads on it&quot; way of making money. That it has worked this long has been very impressive as there is very little barrier to entry, but the commons is so thoroughly stomped upon with blog spam and content farms is finally killing it. Having service providers listen to their users and allow them to disable ads, puts the final nail in that coffin. Is it no wonder they scream loudly?<p>The vote is being called as they say, &quot;Either put up with ads, or pay for your content.&quot;<p>The challenge though is how to negotiate what the content is worth? How do you make a market so that people can actually implement that choice over a wide range of pricing so that the market collectively they can arrive at a price?<p>It is something I thought Bitcoin like systems might help with, but any microtransaction system if it has low enough friction would work. Publishers could tweak the price of page views, readers could read or not read the content provided. Prices would float up to equilibrium and people will be able to once again reason about what an article is worth, whether it was written by a hack in a third world country or written by someone with an established reputation for quality.<p>The existing market is collapsing, and in its place a new market will emerge because people really do like reading stuff. And enough people like it to make it into a market. Capturing that value which was learned back in Ben Franklin&#x27;s days for what became newspapers, will be relearned given the channels and technology we have today. Its cost structure will be different, I would hope more of the value would flow through to the authors but one can never predict these things. Music is in the middle of the same process.

Reddit is known for doing orders of magnitude better coverage of pretty much everything than mainstream media in the same way Hacker News is orders of magnitude better than any tech-related media source. I always thought it was an obvious observation, but it seems not, so let me list some reasons for why this is so:<p>- (an important point to start, because it&#x27;s what many people are missing) ignore the frontpage, head for topical subreddits; pretty much any topic you could imagine has a moderated, HN-quality-like subreddit for it<p>- you can&#x27;t really spin an agenda on Reddit; too many people from all sides participating -> bullshit is eventually identified as such<p>- like here, content on Reddit is created by people who care about the issue at hand, unlike media outlets which usually care about influence and advertising money<p>- unlike mainstream media outlets, Reddit users aren&#x27;t under direct or indirect pressure from governments and corporations to spin the story in a particular way<p>- there are lots of actual experts on Reddit, from every occupation imaginable; so for instance on /r/spacex you&#x27;ll find actual aerospace industry professionals, actual historians on /r/History, etc; they all participate in their free time and have no incentive, monetary or otherwise, to bullshit, nor their contributions are twisted by editorial staff to say whatever the outlet wants them to say like mainstream media does all the time<p>- whatever bullshit the mainstream media publishes, Reddit users will find and debunk (again, just like we do here on HN with tech/hard-science-related news)<p>- Reddit does even care about the form more; the main post on the TPP will likely have less typos than the main article in NYT<p>Anyway, what I expect to happen is that the discussions on TPP will quickly turn into a group organizing around a subreddit that will collect and summarize analyses of experts both from mainstream media and Reddit natives. Like usual, there will likely be a sticker post with a huge FAQ directing to detailed answers to all the questions you could possibly ask. All information in one place, throughly verified and free from bullshit.<p>TL;DR: people accusing me of being sarcastic are probably missing out on one of the few bullshit-free sources of information on the Internet.",1444080867

Right now, and for the foreseeable future, drug R&D is expensive. If companies could not patent their drugs they would not make enough money off their product to be profitable. What would this do to the market?<p>One possible way it would work is that all drug development would be done by non-profits and government sponsored labs. Then drug R&D would be paid for directly by the people who want the drugs upfront and anyone could produce them. The final cost of drugs would be just a markup on the manufacturing cost.<p>The alternative is that people would not develop drugs, but I find it hard to believe that this would be the case.",1444079722

I never claimed it was enough to run an economy, because it takes more than monitoring sales to manage an economy.<p>However, monitoring stock is enough to track sales, that&#x27;s my point, tracking sales can be handled without money and without losing the benefits of money in tracking sales.

The only thing I know of that tends to cause people to balk at flags is the frustrating idea that the name of the flag for some reason has to be the same as the name shown to the user, so the inability to rename flags or even use special characters causes people to give up on them... but you should treat them as opaque database tokens, not user-visible metadata, and map them to names. There was then an extension being worked on to store high-level names in the IMAP metadata store, but I don&#x27;t know if it got completed (I havent paid much attention since Mark Crispin passed away: I felt like he was one of the few people keeping IMAP from losing its way, so I am highly concerned that I&#x27;m going to read through the mailing list and find people frantically pushing through all the stuff he had vetoed). But like, adding your own &quot;documented but non-standard&quot; blob to IMAP&#x27;s metadata would still be worlds better than throwing away the entire protocol and starting over again from scratch :/. Honestly, I think the core issue with people working on IMAP is that people these days have very little data structure and algorithm training, particularly when it comes to implementations of parsers, and so when they stare into IMAP they miss the forest for the trees and barely scratch the surface of what it can accomplish before giving up and screaming for their JSON and HTTP.

These days I&#x27;m quite staggered, frankly, how inefficient the auto industry is at writing good firmware and would love the chance to chip at something more useful than what I&#x27;m doing right now.<p>I was asking what you wound up doing afterwards because I was personally curious what career trajectory one can expect going from such cool projects.(esp at that time)<p>It&#x27;s really curious how this bit of history isn&#x27;t that well known. I&#x27;ve only just heard about it 3 days ago. Since they have been working at it since the 80&#x27;s, I would have expected Daimler to have the lead in the sdc game. How brilliant were the people working on it at the time? How come they didn&#x27;t try to hit the market with what they had? I guess it wasn&#x27;t feasible in &#x27;92, but I see the project running till&#x27; at least 2005, so I guess they could have tried putting some commercial applications of it out.",1444078811

Sure, there is probably more effort required with getting memory management right in case you&#x27;re using Java (pooling / using off-heap memory), but Java has some other strengths, like superior concurrency support.<p>IMHO, managed memory for system-level code is nowhere near being a &quot;disaster&quot;. It might be sometimes tricky to get right, but not any harder than getting manual memory management right in C++ (and smart_pointers aren&#x27;t a silver bullet, neither).

I think all employees should get a cost-of-living adjustment, tagged to inflation. So if inflation is 3% in a year, everyone gets 3% right off the bat.<p>I’m torn in that I think the flip-side makes perfect sense. If there is 1% deflation, why shouldn’t employees’ wages be cut by 1% across the board? At the same time I feel that’s the quickest way to see half your development team leave, even though we’re talking about less than the cost of a nice dinner each month.<p>In an environment where the market crashes and it dramatically affects revenue for a business, everything has to be on the table, from layoffs to hiring and raise freezes to voluntary cuts in pay (often to save the job). If you make $100k a year at “market rate” and there’s a huge crash, and you’re given the opportunity to cut your own pay to $80k or try to get a job for $60-90k, what do you do?

Compared to some other job ads I&#x27;ve seen, those at least focus on important industries.<p>I suppose I&#x27;m most skeptical about the claim that they are changing the world somehow. I can&#x27;t believe that every startup is transforming an industry, or even trying to do so. Imagine some idealistic young hacker gung ho about disrupting farming, completely changing the way people grow food forever. And then on their first day, they realize they&#x27;re job amounts to maintaining a mediocre iPhone app.<p>Now I don&#x27;t doubt an iPhone app could make farmers&#x27; lives better. But how much are you gonna change farming? Maybe software can make farming a tad more data-driven or a tad more organized. But the way we grow food won&#x27;t change because some YC startup wrote an app for it.<p>Yet clearly, startups want job candidates to believe they will change the world, or else they wouldn&#x27;t put it in their ads. So what motivation could they have?<p>1. Like someone else mentioned, perhaps &quot;changing the world&quot; is code for &quot;making lots of money.&quot; Could be.<p>2. My hypothesis: Startups use their &quot;change the world&quot; mission to justify low pay, long hours working conditions. People won&#x27;t work under those conditions unless they believe they&#x27;re working for a higher purpose.<p>3. Maybe delusional founders say &quot;change the world&quot; because they actually think their mobile/web-app/cloud crap will disrupt an industry.

6887746,comment,6881319,6886768,2,0,msandford,,,"I&#x27;ll make an investing analogy.  Investors understand very well the importance of diversification in a portfolio to reduce volatility and as a result, enhance yields.  It is easy for them to do this as the overhead for buying a stock might be as small as pressing a &quot;buy&quot; button.  Obviously there&#x27;s some thinking and research as well, but it is probably measured in days or weeks.<p>Human beings tend not to be diversified in their skills portfolio because  the efficiency gains of specialization has strongly encouraged people to specialize by way of greater income or profits.  Most years this is excellent as the demand for goods and services tends to change fairly slowly.  That makes it possible for supply and demand to roughly line up and for people to be gainfully employed.  But when there is a demand shock it wreaks havoc upon industry as the highly tuned, efficient machine (or group of people) can now produce 2x or 3x the demand.<p>There are some who do have a diverse set of skills who I would argue are resilient to demand shocks.  Someone who is a carpenter and a mechanic is less affected by the demand which is out of his control and more affected by the decisions he makes for which skill to offer on the market.  The demand for fixing cars and carpentry is likely much less correlated than the demand for carpentry and carpentry (perfect correlation) or the demand for carpentry and plumbing (highly correlated).<p>Now obviously it isn&#x27;t easy or free to be both a mechanic AND a carpenter and over a single year it&#x27;s obviously a waste of time to pursue both.  But over 10 years or a career it would likely be beneficial.  The time spent learning a second trade is effectively an employment insurance premium.  It&#x27;s a costly one to be sure but you could look at it that way.<p>Society benefits from this skills diversity as well.  Aggregate demand is higher with full employment and full employment is easier to attain when people can recover from job loss in days instead of months.",1386772092

Not really news.<p>The UK Government also regarded the ANC as a terrorist organisation, given its fathership of the MK which had a close relationship with ZAPU through the 1970s.<p>But behind the scenes successive UK Governments negotiated between the ANC and the SA Governments.  That was the nature of the times; one thing in public and another in private, just like in Northern Ireland.<p>As an odd aside, the SADF prized the Swedish-supplied rations that were supplied to ANC and SWAPO; Sweden covertly supported those groups from the early 1970s.",1386770573

I fought (and lost) a great fight trying to convince coworkers that it is a dead end and that no one will support future development or adapt it to modern versions of Windows, because no one would pay to this huge effort which must be done right on time. In other words, it was a naive blind faith in so-called desktop apps (built on top of a wired third-party toolkit), while it was obvious that a browser is the proper way of visualizing an information. This is the Delphi mentality. Now they have a dead codebase and whole project is in ruins. The irony was that it was some in-house a-la ERP system.)",1386770445

Our bipolar government means that at any given time, at least 45% of the nation tacitly approves of the way things are going, just given the political party in power. Of those that disapprove, most don&#x27;t care all that much and only a very small percentage would actually be willing to fight for real freedom. Pit that number against the current military and police structure that exists basically to maintain its own power (hint: it is rare they actually protect and serve the American citizenry) at the discretion of Government, and what do you wind up with?

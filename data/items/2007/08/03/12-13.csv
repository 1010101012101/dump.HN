38990,story,,,1,0,Ultrapreneur,"Taking votes on Anywhere.FM",,"So I just visited the Anywhere.FM beta site which is funded by Y Combinator, and I must admit I was pretty impressed with what I saw. Their concept is pretty simple, have users upload their music, then be able to access it from anywhere.  When I'm not working on the next big thing I work as a consultant for military companies, and I'm not allowed to bring in items such as camera phones with music players, or anything that can store sensitive data.. i.e. music player with USB interface.  I always enjoy listening to music while I work, and Anywhere.FM has created the perfect solution for me and probably alot of others.<p>I'm putting my money on the guys at Anywhere.FM  (nice job)<p>what's your thoughts?",1186145710

A lot of them probably don't take these networks seriously. This is wishful thinking. We've always known that word of mouth and independent opinions are more powerful than formal marketing programs. Web 2.0 is just the latest reflection of that reality.",1186144863

They can't get the actual code that creates the app's functionality, in the same way that you can't decompile an MP3 and get the instrumental tracks that make it up.",1186143119

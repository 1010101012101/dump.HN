6101375,story,,,1,2,pain_perdu,"What info (if any) should be kept secret about new startup ideas?",,"Many experts, including Brad Feld in his awesome book Venture Deals, have said that asking VCs or others to sign an NDA for a basic pitch is an obvious sign of an amateur and totally not necessary.  That makes a lot of sense to me.  But very recently I came up with a concept for a netsec startup that I think I can whip up a MVP for in less than a month and start generating significant and very scalable income immediately there after.  So in other words, with minimal time and resources and expertise, this idea can generate a lot of cash.<p>Now given time, I think I will be able to build up increasing complex algorithms to improve upon the process to such a degree that I will have a good amount of defensibility for the longer-term.<p>At this early stage of the game, I would like to get as much feedback about my idea as possible (I&#x27;ve already told about 7 people and almost all thought it was a good-to-great idea, many of them have already given me token investments as a sign of confidence) but if my idea is even half as clever as I think it is, if enough people hear about it someone is likely to give it a try for themselves because it is such a simple money-maker.<p>So what do you think?  Should I stop being paranoid and just tell the world or if not, which elements (generally speaking) should I keep to myself?",1374739128

It makes sure packages are usable as they are, rather than the normal process of config, make, make-install, and last adding user configuring before anything will start up. Debian is not Gentoo.<p>For those daemons which this isn&#x27;t possible, package maintainers has a harder time. One of the better ways is simply to have it run, but in a safe way which do nothing.

E.g account X appears in the &quot;ad&quot; endorsing some &quot;Barista Bar&quot;. What if X has a competing shop of his own? Or is against coffee and stimulants and writes books on health diets?

6101349,comment,6101161,6101301,19,0,fsckin,,,"This is why we can&#x27;t have nice things.<p>On the topic of scalpers, Louis CK apparently hired [0] scalpers to help build some anti-scalper checks (I assume it is similar to fraud detection rules: multiple purchases from the same IP, out of town billing addresses) that runs on his website where he now sells all of his tickets.  If you get flagged by a rule, the ticket goes to will-call, so you have to show ID and the credit card at the event.  That small step to prevent it significantly reduces the resale value for a scalper who can&#x27;t attend the event.<p>Here&#x27;s the interesting part:  It worked!  Roughly 25% of all tickets for major shows fall into the hands of scalpers.  On Louis CK&#x27;s last tour, of all 125k+ tickets he sold, than than 1% were scalped.  [1]<p>What&#x27;s really terrible about the whole scalping business is that it would be solved, but only by the people who care least:  The venue has a perverse incentive allowing scalpers to buy every last ticket they can get their greedy little hands on.  As long as a ticket gets sold, they don&#x27;t care.  Screw the fans.<p>Possibly NSFW language in these links.

I&#x27;ve been running production apps, server-side, with Mono ...</i><p>The whole ecosystem is Windows only and tightly coupled with Visual Studio. You do not have Maven for example and personally I could never get NuGet to run. Also, before the new generational garbage collector, which was just declared stable, ASP.NET was leaking memory because the old conservative garbage collector had problems with the allocation patterns of ASP.NET. Yes, you could run your fancy app on Linux, but for anything serious you had to restart your servers periodically.<p>Performance sucks too for ASP.NET apps. It&#x27;s not acceptable for a compiled and statically typed language to have the same performance as Python, or sometimes even worse. Part of the reason for that is the heaviness of ASP.NET and the IIS coupling that is missing in Mono. But then again, why should that be your problem, when better alternatives for Unix are available?<p>Also, ever tried debugging / profiling an app in production? Seriously, you have to be slightly masochistic to use Mono on server-side.<p>Fun fact: .NET&#x27;s debugging symbols are not a part of ECMA&#x27;s standards, are not documented and for a long time Mono used its own incompatible format for debugging symbols.<p>> <i>Microsoft did release an open source version of .NET (Rotor) that ran on Mac OS and FreeBSD</i><p>Rotor was never open-source. &quot;Shared source&quot; is not open-source. In fact people that contributed to Mono were warned to not look at Rotor&#x27;s source-code.<p>> <i>After all, Sun put money into Java, which didn&#x27;t seem to help their revenues, right?</i><p>Blaming Java somehow for Sun&#x27;s failure is a logical fallacy. There is no proof that .NET helped Microsoft&#x27;s bottom line (my gut tells me that it did the opposite). Also, I&#x27;m pretty sure Java was a major reason for why Oracle bought Sun and for why Google was also thinking of buying Sun.<p>> <i>when MS decided to adopt Java, Sun cut &#x27;em off</i><p>Microsoft had an explicit agreement with Sun. They broke it by making Visual J++ both source and binary incompatible with Java. This isn&#x27;t regular &quot;adoption&quot;, but rather their usual embrace/extend strategy. Also .NET 1.0 was J++.<p>> <i>The parts of .NET that are platform-specific are for good reason. Cross-platform UIs, for instance (like Java&#x27;s), seem to universally suck</i><p>That&#x27;s a poor example. When thinking of cross-platform, I think more about Qt than I think about Swing. Also, platform-specific behaviour has leaked much further than Windows Forms. For example, Mono&#x27;s implementation of asynchronous sockets suffered for years because System.Net.Sockets was modelled after Windows&#x27; kernel and doesn&#x27;t map cleanly with poll/epoll/kqueue.",1374737299

The whole thing is fascinating and full of amazing stories.<p><a href=""http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_History/Taylor_Robert/102702015.05.01.acc.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_Histo...</a><p>The relevant excerpt:<p>McJones: Did you work for two different companies between teaching and going to NASA or just one company?<p>Taylor: Two. I was at Martin for about a year, I guess, Martin Orlando. And one of my colleagues there had gone to work for a flight simulation firm in Riverdale, Maryland just outside of D.C. They were called ACF Electronics. They built a wider variety of flight simulators than any other company in the country. They made me an attractive job offer and we moved up there and I went to work for them. While I was there, McNamara, who was with Kennedy, who had just been elected president, was Secretary of Defense, standardized or attempted to standardize many of the aircraft across the Navy and the Air Force. Consequently, a company that based its reputation on building a wide variety of flight simulators was no longer quite so important because we were not going to have as wide a variety of airplanes. So ACF had been looking for other things to do and NASA was just opening up. I was encouraged to write a research proposal to NASA using flight simulators, but in a research context rather than in a teaching context. For example, one of the flight simulators that the company built was an anti-submarine warfare airplane flight simulator where you could simulate all of the stations in the airplane that were monitoring various sensor devices that were looking for submarines. There was a lot of display technology to fool around with and things that NASA was interested in. So I wrote this research proposal and sent it in. NASA called me and asked me to come down and talk to them. I thought they wanted to talk about the research proposal. And instead, they offered me a job in their newly-formed office of advanced research and technology. The job of this part of NASA was to fund the NASA research centers and also fund limited research in limited areas in private industry, and sometimes universities. Then they put me in charge of two research areas to manage the funding that went into these areas, whether it was the NASA center or in the private world. The areas were manned flight control systems and flight displays. While I was there I created another area called simulation technology. So I managed research in those three areas while I was at NASA. One of the unsolicited proposals that came in was from a guy named [Douglas C.] Engelbart at SRI.3	I thought it was an interesting proposal and he came into D.C. on his round of looking for money, and we talked. I funded his proposal and the mouse was created by NASA funding. Most people dont know that. Remember when NASA was advertising Tang as its big contribution to the civilized world? Well, there was a better example, but they didnt know about it.<p>McJones: Was that the beginning of Doug Engelbarts major funding?<p>Taylor: He had some smaller amount of funding I think from the Air Force, but the mouse work was actually done under a NASA project. And then when I went to ARPA, I funded it more, but Licklider had funded him as well, as a result partly of my funding.",1374737107

With GTK#, you could build something very quick with a modern virtual machine, framework bindings for pretty much the entire free desktop stack (they automatically generated them and kept them up to date with every release), high level language and IDE with great syntax highlighting and autocomplete.<p>What did happen was a massive irrational backlash against C# by neckbeards that ended with it being kicked out of GNOME core and off the debian and ubuntu install CD&#x27;s, all because they saw Microsoft name against the standard, didn&#x27;t agree with the patents (a fact of life when you build software) and bricked themselves.",1374736032

Even working for a large public healthcare provider. Slightly worse, there was even a torrent client using their fibre. The trick was to find an IT illiterate colleague or one who was leaving it best of all, both these things in one person. Their logins wouldn&#x27;t e revoked for months or years.
Use their login to set up torrent clients. If you called IT support and just played dumb you always found someone who would let you install stuff (I need this program for my section on ankle casting). Keep calling back until they answer.
Once a torrent was running, stay well away from the computer until no one else is around as grumpy IT guys would hang round to try and catch you. This was long ago now, I pay for my media now, with the exception of a few shows from the UK which I can&#x27;t pay for.",1374735976

Not that the factors he mentions don&#x27;t contribute, but this still illustrates the bubble many of the Apple-focused  bloggers live in (and, arguably, a bubble that Apple itself lives in to some degree, but that&#x27;s a separate subject).<p>Most of the tablet usage surveys I&#x27;ve there focus on the US. Android tablets are most popular (by far I believe) in Asia. Here&#x27;s a personal anecdote: When I went to Hong Kong Disneyland last fall I saw as many (maybe even more) people taking pictures with Samsung tablets as I did with iPads. That&#x27;s just not the sort of tablet usage you&#x27;ll see in the US. There&#x27;s a big world out there and many people focused on the US have no idea how well Android (including Android tablets) is doing in the rest of it.",1374735916

The switch would suggest that at least some of these individuals (on both sides) are motivated by politics and not principle.<p>But you&#x27;re not talking about the same thing.  The idea that you can support warrantless tapping of international calls when the other end of the line is a suspected terrorist and oppose the dragnet of all call records and emails doesn&#x27;t indicate a lack of principle.

I would just realize I need to do this on a separate desktop, and use my shortcuts to fling to an empty one.<p>On OSX this involves clicking, dragging and aiming at the correct space, which completely stopped me from using spaces at all. I tried dedicated spaces for certain applications, but found that to be annoying when I want to run one of those apps in the context of my current space.<p>I was kinda hoping Lion would improve on this, but sadly it seems they went the opposite direction.",1311242392

Doing abstraction right is a very hard thing indeed and requires the right training and education. None of the creators of the current frameworks have had those, and therefore their creations may be brilliant, but flawed. When an abstraction is done right, you won't feel any pressing need to go beyond it. When it is not done right, you are happy that at least it is ""leaky"", but calling this leakiness a feature just misses the point in the first place.",1311242168

I'm really fed up with having to deprogramme people who've written too much jQuery and don't actually know JavaScript, or worse, barely realise that there is such a language.<p>I appreciate that your suggestion is to learn jQuery and then go through a language reference, not to stop once you've done the jQuery bit, but trust me, that's just what most people will do.<p>jQuery is a very opinionated library, which is fine in and of itself, but that makes it a terrible introduction to JavaScript, precisely because it ""hides most of the ugliness of the language"", as you put it.<p>To understand why this is a problem, consider the following points.<p>1) jQuery is not the only DOM library out there. Prototype, MooTools, Dojo and YUI are just some of them. To be a good front-end developer one should know at least a couple, and be able to learn any of them. The easiest way to learn them is to know the language and just learn a library, rather than learning a bunch of different DSLs with perhaps a few unifying themes.<p>2) JavaScript is now used on the server as well, and to write server-side JavaScript one really does need to know the language.<p>3) If one ever wants to write anything beyond hacky little scriptsa real web application, for examplethen one cannot get away with just knowing jQuery. Large applications must be structured. The rats' nest of callbacks that many jQuery programmers seem to think is sufficient and even appropriate application design will not scale to large codebases. The key skill here is knowing what sort of structure needs to be introduced and being able to use both use libraries which provide the necessary abstraction and write one's own where necessary.",1311241063

I like that OS X no longer enforces a grid and that it proportionally resizes Windows (instead of making them all the same size).<p>I think I also like that windows of the same app are grouped together. One possible downside are the resulting overlapping windows, I think, though, its wroth the tradeoff.<p>I do not like that single app Expos still forces apps on a grid and still forces them all to the same size. That said, I rarely use single app Expos.<p>The new implementation of Spaces might actually be able to entice me to use them from time to time, so it seems like an improvement for me personally.

Creating 1 thread per connection is for unskilled programmers.\nSometimes the simple solutions are the best.  Developing a complex and clever solution may your feel more skilled.  Using a dispacther pattern often doesn't provides a real advantage and or the advantage it provides isn't needed.<p>I would agree with the suggestion that if you are going to use a dispatcher pattern with NIO, use a library like netty which does this for you.

7790163,comment,7789363,7789766,2,0,gamblor956,,,"There is a statute of limitations for the IRS to audit you on a properly filed return (3-6 years, depending on the specific return).  However, there is no statute of limitations for imposing back taxes/penalties/interest on income that was never reported.<p>In some circumstances, this can even include later years in which a return was filed, if the unreported income affected the income, deductions, credits, losses, or other tax items in that later year. This is usually not an issue for individuals, as the problem usually arises from carried-over losses or credits that are generally available only to corporate entities.",1400864345

It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re out committing genocide or something. You&#x27;re programming, and you have to work on a crappy programming task. Every programmer who ever worked a professional job has had to do this at some point. If the very fiber of your soul is wrapped up in your employer&#x27;s MegaAccounting Client V3.0 REST API, I&#x27;d recommend re-thinking your emotional attachment to your job.<p>That money you get every two weeks is called &quot;compensation&quot; because it is compensating you for your time, which you would probably otherwise spend doing something more pleasant. This is the realistic world of grown-up work life.<p>If your company&#x27;s Marketing bone-head says the customers want a green oval button instead of a system-standard button, well, it&#x27;s stupid, but I&#x27;d laugh at how much they&#x27;re paying to get this ridiculous code written and just write the damn code. It&#x27;s really not worth losing sleep or sanity over. Not being emotionally attached to your work allows you to shrug off the stupid stuff that Really Doesn&#x27;t Matter.",1400864303

Likewise, the affected publisher, and the news media, are not obligated to fail to inform the public of Amazon&#x27;s tactics so that they are aware that Amazon having smaller-than-usual discounts, &quot;not available&quot; notices, and long shipping times may well be a sign not of any issue with the availability of the book, but of Amazon&#x27;s disputes with the publisher, and that therefore if they are encountered when looking for a particular book, a consumer would be well advised to look at other online retailers, who, while their usual discounts may be lower, may have better discounts for the book at issue or have it available when Amazon says its unavailable, or have it with a more reasonable shipping time when Amazon does not.<p>Amazon is essentially leveraging the trust that consumers have in them as presenting a seemingly comprehensive catalog and best terms in the online book retailing business to selectively pressure publishers, and its completely fair to inform consumers that, in the particular case of these kinds of disputes, that trust may, however well earned it was previously, not be warranted -- and what the particular symptoms are that such a dispute is affecting the book you are looking for.",1400864036

7790136,story,,,1,2,Micand,"Ask HN: Good 15-20 min. CS challenge for high school students?",,"I am helping design a CS-related activity for a Let&#x27;s Talk Science competition (http://www.letstalkscience.ca), which promotes STEM amongst high school students. In the competition, teams of six students will move from station to station, trying to complete each as quickly as possible.<p>One station might give the team a metre stick, then ask them to measure the height of a building. (This can be solved by using similar triangles to estimate the building&#x27;s height.) Time penalties are added to the team&#x27;s completion time depending on how close their answer was.<p>My constraints are thus:<p><pre><code>  * Most students won&#x27;t have CS/programming knowledge\n  * Challenge should not require a computer\n  * Idea should challenge teams of six students for 15-20 minutes\n  * Challenge must have clear answer that can be objectively scored (not judged)\n</code></pre>\nOne reasonably good challenge presents a sentence encoded with a Caesar cipher, then asks the students to decode it. The person running the station give a short explanation of what a Caesar cipher is, then leave the teams to decode the text. Time penalties are awarded based on correctness -- each incorrect character adds a 30-second penalty.<p>The Caesar cipher idea has been used often in the past, however, and I&#x27;m trying to develop something novel. I have been through the various activities on CS Unplugged (http://csunplugged.org/activities), but none appealed to me -- the exercises I saw were generally aimed at illustration and not suitable for competition, were too simple, or required too much explanation of background knowledge.<p>Do you have any ideas on what would make a fun CS-related challenge for teams of six high school students?<p>Thanks!",1400863895

[...] If I could go back to my early career I would mercilessly cut out all the shitty jobs I did<p>You know, it&#x27;s hard to believe it, but at some point parents forget what it felt like being a teenager, and senior developers being junior. I know I&#x27;m going hard against the grain here, but I think you&#x27;re better off doing as jblow did, not as he says.<p>Priority #1: survive, life gets better. In any organization that&#x27;s large enough to have a pecking order, sh*t rolls downhill. Your CEO meets the customer&#x27;s CEO and sees some fish on the office walls. He decides that an aquatic theme will increase sales, and passes it on to project management. PMs are slightly bemused, but figure out some web pages that can feature animated fish, and vet the idea with senior developers, who agree it can be done before the next trade show. The senior developer creates the fish_type, group_of_fish and fish_animation tables, grabs a few morsels that are fun to implement (new web technologies, yay!), and passes the rest to you. Congratulations, you&#x27;re the junior developer at the bottom of the scrap heap! You not only have to deal with all the crap nobody else wanted, but will also explain it as lines of code to your computer. And, after re-implementing several times to address all concerns from meetings you were never invited to, it turns out the customer&#x27;s CEO had borrowed the office and actually hates fish since choking on a herring bone 32 years ago.<p>How do you deal with all this? Well, maybe quitting will find you a better job as a junior developer. (Also, maybe an uncle you never knew suddenly leaves you his fortune.) But realistically, the way most people do it is the same as jblow&#x27;s. You find ways to survive, improve your resume, and eventually move uphill to have more choice in kinds of crap you need to deal with. Sharing your hard-earned wisdom with junior developers will only be the cherry on top at that point...",1400863368

That way it would do one large sequential write rather than multiple small random writes (which is a killer for most consumer flash drives and the limiting bit in terms of using portable apps from flash drives).  And it abstracted it all so that the individual files were stored in its own container.  As such, you had to be absolutely sure you were safe ejecting.<p>Fun fact: you can get some of the same effect by using something like TrueCrypt containers on flash media as you wind up with a bit of the same behavior.  The downside is that you can then only use it on a machine you have admin rights on or a machine where TrueCrypt is already installed and traveler mode enabled.<p>Source: I created Portable Firefox and run PortableApps.com.",1400862756

So what we are seeing is as more and more data accumulates in these places, it becomes more and more valuable. And so â€˜eavesdroppersâ€™ move to those places and even â€˜eavesdroppersâ€™ without a legal backing also try to move to those places.

By adding it to all the open source data out there in the world, and using it to tell you the answers to questions you didnâ€™t know you had. Thatâ€™s business intelligence.<p>The real threat of facebook is the BI layer on top of facebook warehouse.

You have classes of people that you want you want agents, you want sources you have adversaries, and you have influencables, that is people you torture who are related to adversaries wives, husbands, fathers, daughter you know those people.<p>So you are looking for classes of people. You donâ€™t know their names, but you know what they are like you know who is recrutable for you as an agent you know who are likely sources, you can give the social characteristics of your adversaries, and once you know your adversaries, you can find the influencables.<p>So what you want to do is run code inside facebook. It will help you find the people that you want it will show you the people whose behavior and whose social circles tell you that they are what you want by way of agent, sources what their adversaries are and who you can torture to get to them.<p>So you donâ€™t want data out of facebook the day you have data out of facebook it is dead.

If you end up having to seriously maintain &quot;unclean&quot; code, you did it wrong. You <i>will</i> do it wrong before you get the hang of it, no sarcasm. Untrained gut intuitions are not very reliable here, and the only training available is practice.<p>And on the other hand, &quot;maintain&quot; is a very ambiguous word. If you are frustrated because it took you ten minutes to add one field to a form, once in the course of 3 years (to put some concrete numbers on for example&#x27;s sake), you <i>still</i> came out ahead not spending an additional 10 hours polishing the code to a fine sheen, so you could be happy adding that one field 3 years later and saving that ten minutes. If you&#x27;re frustrated because you actually have to overhaul it significantly, and it&#x27;s a mess, and now you&#x27;ve also dropped all your context and can&#x27;t remember what is what at all, and you could have cleaned up up three years ago in three hours and now lose two weeks just to understanding what the hell, then you&#x27;ve lost, yes.

7789902,comment,7789014,7789438,8,0,Patrick_Devine,,,"I agree with just about everything in your post.  I&#x27;ve been on dead-end death march projects before, and I&#x27;ve also been on great projects which get ridiculous design-by-committee requirements.  I think both are equally soul-crushing, and if you find yourself in that situation you need to get out quickly.<p>There are times in your career though when sticking through a difficult challenge is absolutely worth doing.  Flitting from task to task because something is &quot;hard&quot; or because a particular feature is not obviously useful is just as bad.  I&#x27;ve seen a lot of programmers who aren&#x27;t &quot;closers&quot;.  They can get a project to about 85%-90% completion, but can&#x27;t manage to finish those last few things to get something out the door.<p>So the answer, I think, is balance.  You need to have a good picture of what you&#x27;re working on and why.  If you don&#x27;t really believe in the project, or if it&#x27;s being slowly killed with thousands of absurd changes, it makes those difficult periods really, really hard to endure.  In those cases, get out, and get out fast.",1400860921

I've also placed an ad on another that claims it can help me find a technical co-founder. Then I put an ad with links to each of these campaigns on my company website (superspeedyservers.com).<p>Of 8 people I initiated contact with on the sites which I have a 'Pro' membership, none so far have seemed interested enough to get back to me, which is discouraging, 1 person has reached out to me, but hasn't followed up with a new reply after I got back to them, and on the other site with the ad, I got 1 reply from someone who's interested.<p>Part of me is inclined to start working with the first person who appears to be qualified and interested, out of fear that there won't be any more 'applicants' for lack of a better word for them. But I know the act of finding a good co-founder is akin to marriage, and I don't want to partner up with the wrong person.<p>So I'm wondering how this vetting process should go, considering that I have 6 months of 'Pro' account remaining on these sites, and don't know how many 'applicants' I may or may not see.<p>I don't want to squander the opportunities I do get, but I don't want to jump the gun & take the first 'applicant' for the sake of taking the first 'applicant'.<p>What are HN readers' thoughts on this?<p>Thanks.",1368874551

Having spit out copious amounts of code for over 10 years now, I don't think productivity in a larger sense declines with age. Physically or in terms of life priorities, writing code all-night long is not so much fun anymore, but any reduction in energy is made up by a higher efficiency due to experience. At least, that's the way things have been so far!<p>I definitely have productivity swings (and I make myself feel better by saying they're akin to moood-swings and out of my control!) Productivity is highest for me when I'm in a highly structured environment. I've churned out insane amounts of code when<p>a) I knew exactly what needed to be done and
b) Had a sharp timeline to complete it<p>#a happens externally sometimes, when requirements are crystal-clear. For example, when you build stuff on <a href=""http://community.topcoder.com/tc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://community.topcoder.com/tc</a> Otherwise, my approach is to spend as much time as needed in order to clarify requirements. I simply do not bother to code unless I'm sure about the end-goal.<p>#b can be seen in hackathons, or when a team / startup has committed to a demo-day (it can also be artificially imposed by managers)<p>When both #a and #b are externally satisfied, I can code all day long without problems. Things like headphones (to prevent interruptions) are useful but not necessary unless the environment is extremely distracting.<p>When #b is satisfied but not #a, I try to reduce the uncertainty around requirements - otherwise jumping in to code and then having to throw it away can be killing. At some point, the RoI in trying to achieve more certainty will get negative, at which point I start coding with whatever I have.<p>When you have #a but not #b, it is very easy to procrastinate. Of late I'm inspired by www.structuredprocrastination.com (brilliant, short read) to still maintain productivity.<p>Finally, having neither #a nor #b is the worst. Being in startup mode for the last few years I've seen how difficult that is.

And because of that I think the author missed out on raising a bigger and more interesting discussion: (I'll quote one of the comments on his site as that phrases is things rather well)<p><i>Interesting, but the article misses the point in all kinds of ways. It was common knowledge (at least, to those familiar with Joy Division and Saville's work) that the image itself was appropriated from an original that was in the public domain. The interesting point here is not copyright, but the way in which an image can come to represent a concept such that it gains new meaning. When the intended audience sees this, they think, ""Joy Division"", not ""pulsar"". Hence, when you copy the image by way of Saville, you are appropriating the association that he has established. So, this isn't about stealing images, it's about riding on the coat-tails of a talented designer who managed to create a strong brand.</i><p><i>A proper understanding of what's going on here makes this sentiment: ""If you ever want to use the image for your own personal benefit, just make sure its clear you have no connection with Joy Division, Peter Saville, etc"" pretty shiesty.</i>",1368872956

2525525,comment,2525079,2525079,1,0,biot,,,"A great feature would be for Google to retain the checksum of the page at the time it was indexed and pass that along to the browser (eg: Chrome).  If the checksums don't match, the browser can do a background call for Google to re-fetch the page and recalculate the checksum.  If the checksums still don't match display a warning message to the user.<p>There would likely be some work required to weed out false positives from things like dynamic content, so perhaps only non-text parts should be checksummed... but if one of the biggest issues is malware sites serving up an innocuous page to Google crawlers instead of the malware-filled page that is served to users, something like that would be a good initial sanity check.",1304845169

I'd call that pretty disastrous.<p>Actually, I would count the graceful degradation of the British empire (i.e without the entire country going to hell) as quite an achievement - particularly considering it happened with a surprisingly low level of long-term resentment incurred from the former colonies.  Further, the claim that it was due to poor management more than, for example, two ludicrously expensive wars, is more than a touch disingenuous.<p>I suppose one could argue that the first of those wars was rather a waste, but Britain was hardly the only country to be affected by that particular insanity.",1304843175

I had the impression that the difference in python's runtime would be made up for how much more succinctly you can code in it and by all the syntactic sugar... but I guess not. In fact, I noticed some of the top guys have various built in libraries to help them reduce their time spent on input handling and various solver interfaces.

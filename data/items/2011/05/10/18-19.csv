2533669,comment,2533406,2533549,1,0,pemulis,,,"Bitcoin prices have a tendency to plummet, too. After they passed the $4 mark for the first time, the price dropped precipitously, as people began to worry about a bubble. I expect the same thing to happen now that the price has passed the $5 mark. (In fact, as of this writing, the price has already dropped from a high of $5.2 down to $4.95.) There are a lot of weird psychological factors at play here. Another issue is that the trading volume is far to small to see anything like a ""real"" price. There only seem to be a few thousand people buying and selling Bitcoins right now, and the majority of  those Bitcoins are held by an even smaller group. Until millions of people start using Bitcoins, the exchange rates are based on the psychology of a tiny, tiny mob. This results in totally insane spreads like today, with $3.8 at the low end and $5.2 at the high end.<p>But here's the Catch-22: As more people start using Bitcoins, they become inherently more valuable. This causes the price to increase, bringing enormous, sudden profits to people trading on the Mt. Gox exchange. The new Bitcoin owners see this happen, and naturally get in the trading game themselves, since it looks like a great way to get rich quick. This drives the price even higher, bringing more attention to Bitcoin, bringing in more users, &c., &c. And so Bitcoins wind up being used for speculation more than as a medium of exchange.<p>The only way I could see this cycle breaking is if some merchant emerges that provides an attractive reason to spend Bitcoins on a large scale, instead of just trading them back and forth. The obvious use case (to me) is online gambling: An online casino or poker room that started accepting Bitcoins could then bring in U.S. players without risking prosecution for money laundering, since there is no bank intermediary they have to work with, and no way for them to know which customers are from the U.S. and which are from countries where online gaming is perfectly legal. Until a big institutional merchant gets in the game, Bitcoins are just going to be like baseball cards or Beanie Babies or tulips circa 1636.",1305053836

Been through an acquisition and all that.  I've lived for the past 4 years inside puppet's DSL automating services in puppet rather than in perl or python.<p>What I've done<p>Scaled sphere to almost 200 servers; saved us additional ops hires by implementing config management early (10 minutes from box delivery to operational); and saved something like $1.2M over 4 years in additional webserver costs by implementing varnish cache and tuning it to get an 82% hit rate.<p>What people say about me:<p>“Mike joined Sphere as one of its earliest employees, right before our first public beta launch. Mike has an impressive grasp of a wide range of technologies and keeps abreast of new developments. His constant drive to optimize kept Sphere running smoothly and cost-effectively during that first beta and throughout the many subsequent product launches and steep growth.”<p>“Mike joined Sphere during the early startup days as one of the first full-time employees. He juggled activities spanning a wide spectrum of system administration tasks. Mike impressed early on with a high degree of dedication, essentially responding to emails or phone calls at almost any time of the day, while maintaining a can-do, problem-solving attitude. He made significant contributions to our success.”<p>“I worked very closely with Mike at Sphere, designing our production infrastructure and stepping back to let him run with it. Despite our steep growth and continuous development strategy, Mike was always on top of our needs. His attention to detail, willingness to tackle any challenge, and aggressive pursuit of better solutions not only saved us many times, but laid a solid foundation for the company's success.”<p>Why I need remote:<p>I live on a farm in rural Oregon, about an hour out of portland.  I'll commute there if I have to, but I would rather give the commute time to my family.<p>Why I'm looking now:<p>Sphere was just spun out of AOL over to a new place, and they had four SAs already, and I'm nearly done with the transition assistance.  I've been looking for remote gigs, but haven't had luck finding opportunities.  In the mean time, I've been doing a bit of outside extra consulting to keep the skills sharp.<p>I'll happily send a resume out if requested.<p>Thanks!",1305053132

2533623,comment,2530663,2530663,20,0,rayiner,,,"It's become pretty popular these days to devalue asian immigrant culture, but most of the commentary misses the point. The intro piece to the article states exactly the facts that ""Tiger Moms"" are concerned about: Asians are more educated and make more money on average.<p>Asian parenting is about downside management. Yeah your kid might not end up a top CEO, but he's also less likely to end up as a plumber. There are worse things than ending up in middle management at IBM making six figures...<p>Also, as someone who went through the whole ""asian education treadmill"", I'll make two observations:<p>1) The point about Stuyvesant is dead-on. My high school was also a public magnet school and the culture was the same way: the people at the top were both pretty and smart. However, the take-away isn't really what what the author makes it out to be. The popular white kids weren't gunning any less hard than the asian kids. They socialized then went home and studied just as hard. The problem isn't that asian parents emphasize hard work in lieu of socialization, it's that they just emphasize hard work, largely b/c coming from a different culture socialization isn't something they can really help their kids with.<p>2) The PWC example is also dead on, but again, the takeaway is different than what the other concludes. In a law, accounting, financial firm, you don't get pigeon-holed for being a hard worker. The white guy who makes partner (or managing director or whatever) works every bit as hard as the asian guy, but plays the politics on top of that. Being ""too good for bitch work"" is a sure way to get yourself fired at a law firm or an investment bank. At the same time, schmoozing with a partner to get better assignments is absolutely not at odds with working hard and being the guy who can get things done.<p>These articles consistently manage to misunderstand both asian culture and american culture. Succeeding in America does not require rejecting asian work ethic. Americans work as hard as anyone. That high school football star has a dad who pushes him to practice just as hard as any ""Tiger Mom"" would. Succeeding in America does require a forthrightness and social perceptiveness that many asians choose not to develop, but that is absolutely not at odds with an asian upbringing.",1305053091

This would allow you to reuse model-theoretic semantics with a serving of tensors and vector spaces on top, and it would do at least those things that generalized quantifiers can do.

A rockstar hacker will not join your team right off the bat (unless you are really lucky or went to elementary school with her). After getting v1.0 out the door you can market the shit out of it using your business knowhow, this is very important. If you are a marketing/business rockstar you will attract good hackers because you can pull your weight getting people to use the fucking product.<p>A great way to find great hackers is to be in an area where programming is only one part of their life. You don't have to be in SV to start a startup. Attract people that also like rock climbing (in my case) and make a connection on that level. Use local talent, most of the rockstar hackers come from towns from across the US and world and end up in SV.<p>I was in your position and I just kept marketing myself and the business idea.

What's the margin on SKU Y? etc. The FKs facilitate this. Update the SKU description, assuming the product is still the same product, and all the data flows through properly to the reports.<p>Really, the relation model is not optimized for ""first-order"" applications, such as saving and displaying a complex entity. Document dbs are great at this.<p>Instead, it's optimized for second and third-order applications, like ""show me all the clients that ordered X in March but didn't order Y in April."" The whole point of the relation model is to make the data orthogonal to any particular application. Try asking those second-order questions of your document-based DB.

You don't, you can make some guesses, but this is where the normal forms come in: ""follow these rules, and you can use your data for anything!""

I've commented on FB about themonkeys in the trees, the toucans, and the sweet ocean breezes I feelwhile I lay on my hammock. My FB friends of course commented how jealousthey were and how lucky I was to be living in paradise.""Must be nice to have a perfect life"".Rightwell, not exactly.There were the things I never put on FB  how I lost my job and myhusband couldn't find one. We were living with hardly any money and foodfor months and no one there to help. One day I reached rock bottom anddidn't feel like life would ever be good again.I realized around that time that my life had two sides and I could onlyshow one side on FB. Let's face it, no one wants to hear about someone'sissues on the newsfeed, it's just not socially acceptable. It's like beingin a room full of people chatting about the weather and someone startstalking about their messy divorce. It's just not done.Where do you turn when you have no one to talk to about your problems?Where can you vent about your bad day?I realized I'm not the only one with difficulties in my life. Everyone hasproblems and lots of us don't want to dump on our friends. FB needs aplace where anyone can talk about whatever they need to talk about.Not just what we had for dinner or the awesome party we went to last night.Let's GET REAL So I thought, I'm going to do something about this! I am going to make awebsite or place on FB where you can be yourself and vent about anything!Anonymously. How does a woman with 2 toddlers living in the jungles of Costa Rica whodoesn't know much about computers and has no money, do this? Good Question. I believed it was a matter of: if it's supposed to happenit will and I'm going to do my best to see that it does. I had finally found a job and was working at the time my idea came. A weeklater I told one of my co-workers, Nicki, who also lived in CR, that Iwanted to make a website & something on FB. She told me she would help mewith whatever she could.So I told her the idea and immediately she understood exactly what I wastalking about. You see Nicki had recently left her job in Costa Ricabecause her boss and talked rampantly about his sexual escapades and hadhookers in the office all day. She started working for someone else whodidnt pay her last two paychecks. She definitely was in need of somethingamazing. That's how Nicki and I started working together on GET REAL, What twobusiness partners could be any different than Nicki and I? Me- quiet,calm, and conservative; Nicki- loud, energetic, and wild. But we workgreat together and balance each other out. So here we were two women with no money, not much computer knowledge,living in CR, going to make a website and something on FB?We were a little intimidated to say the leastwe both felt a littleinadequate.After all, we werent Harvard attending computer engineers like MarkZuckerburg. Heck I hadn't finished college..So we had the drivebut we started researching and realized after ourweeks of research we needed money to pay a developer to develop a websiteand FB application. And it wasn't going to be cheap. But where would themoney come from? We were both pretty broke. Since the beginning thingswere going really fast with GET REAL, and then the money just showed up.The day after I told Nicki, ""Well all we need now is an investor"", Martincame along. He loved the idea, and committed the money to develop thewebsite, build the FB application, and pay attorney's fees. GET REAL was a go! We hired our developer and started working non-stop, while still workingour jobs. Good thing hubby was a big help, taking care of two toddlers 8hours a day. I told him I had the easier of the two jobs. One thing we realized that since the beginning things have gone soquickly and perfectly that we feel we are just along for a ride thatsomeone else is taking us on.Strange things have happened along the way, like, my computer was struckby lightning --- blue light came out of my hands and surrounded thecomputer. Killed my computer and I got a headache. Nickis hardrivecrashed for apparently no reason and she needed to replace it. No matterwhat wall we ran into we just kept going. Right before the completion of GET REAL, Nicki sent me a story about ayoung man who had posted his suicide note on FB. He had suffered abuse asa child at the hands of a relative. He had carried this pain through lifewith him, and even had gone on to become a successful software engineer,only to shock his friends and family with his suicide. In his suicideletter that he posted on Facebook, he said he never had anyone he felt hecould share his true thoughts with bc he could never do so without fear ofjudgment. He never got to talk to others that had gone through what hehad. He said how he felt he couldn't tell anyone about how much he wassuffering. But the truth isthere are tons of people going through what hewent through. I thought about how many other people suffer like he did andhurt because they have no one to open up to. And I realized even more thatis what GET REAL is for. So now Nicki and I are putting GET REAL out to the world of Farmville,like buttons, and newsfeeds about what a friend had for dinner last night. Am I the only one whose had difficult times in my life, had a bad day,gotten into a fight with a crazy family member, been depressed, lonely,bored? I didn't think so. So now GET REAL is finally finished and ready to be launched. Where canyou go if you need to vent about that bad day you had, the fight you gotinto with that family member, the dark secret you can't tell anyone, orwhat you really think about...whatever. You can go to GET REAL on FB at http://apps.facebook.com/getrealcommunity  or http://www.mygetreal.com<p>From Angel Atencio and Nicki Foote, co-creators of GET REALThanks Martin we couldn't have done it without you.God, you made it happen.Contact: angel@mygetreal.com",1305051975

""As long as the hardware allows"" seems like it provides some wiggle room for carriers to squirm out of any responsibilities to honor this.<p>Additionally, it only says that the devices will receive the latest upgrades for 18 months after the device is first released, which is problematic in many regards. If you get a phone the day it releases and are forced into a two year contract (which you almost certainly will be if you are going with a carrier), then for the final six months, or 25%, of that contract period, the carrier is not required to allow for you to receive Android upgrades. That instantly devalues your device. And what if you get a new device, but not until six months after its release? Well, then your carrier is only required to permit the upgrades for the first year; the last year is back to same old, same old.<p>And it says nothing about how timely the upgrades are. As it currently reads, all it guarantees is that for a year and a half after the device is <i>released</i>, carriers must <i>eventually</i> allow your device to upgrade to the latest version of Android. It is not a long enough time to cover an entire contract period and it has a little clause that is open to interpretation by all parties involved.<p>Edit: I'm writing this from the perspective of an American consumer.

I actually don't have any desire to leave or move, but I can't pass the money up.

What worries me is I don't want to be unethical and lead the second company on and use their time and money without intention of going there, but their offer will be in line with where I should be paid right now, and I feel like using that to try to get a big raise at my current gig could work.  And if my current says no, I have a backup plan.  In addition, this company in Cali (the big dream job opportunity) could get back with me any day now and I'm afraid it would be unfair to either accept a job somewhere else, then leave immediately if the big one comes through, or to get a large raise with my current, then turn around and leave immediately.

Excellent.<p>Is this plan really going to work very often?

But simulations go only so far. They, too, are only metaphors, and if you don't know enough to tinker under their covers they are rather inflexible metaphors. Your classical mechanics simulator is not going to discover quantum mechanics for you.<p>In my experience learning about mathematical abstractions requires <i>all of the above tools</i> -- you tinker with the formalism, you ponder the physical analogies, you draw mental pictures of clouds and colors, you play with a simulator, you build some circuits in the lab, you go for a walk, you tinker with the formalism again, and six years later you finally get it.",1305051229

He also described that business founders' can't recognize good programmers because of the lack of knowledge on coding or the technical expertise required to speak same language. Then, the point stopped right there, without a probable solution on what business founder can do if they're in a situation described.<p>I'm that business founder, and it's proven hard to find the best programmers as I've learned it the hard way. Although, I refuse to believe that's what killed or is going to kill brilliant ideas that may someday grew to be the next google. I certainly don't want to ditch my idea simply because failure to hire good programmers.<p>So in my view, business founders can;<p>1. Go take classes and learn programming, and DIY on the product - This can take a while depending on how fast the business guy learns something completely out of his norm. The time spent on learning something completely new should be spent on building a better business model, think about how the product can respond to users needs, and find ways to cut into the market to gain market share, etc.<p>2. Find a mediocre programmer and start working on the half-baked product and hopes that later down the path the best programmers can see the potential of the product and jump on board  The sugar-coated-topped-with-a-cherry thinking is that the product would probably suck, but at least the product can start gaining exposure. Users like what they see and are willing to wait for the fully developed product to arrive. On the other hand, users may very well see the suck-ness of the half-baked product and bail within 3 seconds.<p>3. Find a technical co-founder that excels at programming but is looking for a business counterpart so he/she can concentrate on programming while the other can focus on the business  Intriguing, but hard to find. Available talent pools are swarmed with programmers that do mediocre coding (or dumb) and just want an easy way out. Rarely do we see a passionate programmer geek that is ambitious enough to embark on a journey with a few obstacle and fails to see the potential of a great business model.<p>4. Ditch the internet startup and start a business without the need of technical expertise  I certainly refuse to take this route, and I dont think a determined and successful entrepreneur would ever ditch the business theyve worked their butts off just because of this one dilemma. But what can we do?<p>I want to ask the successful business oriented startups that got through this phase.<p>Whats your take?<p>Which route do you guys see more viable? \nAre there any other suggestions other than the ones listed above? If business founders are stuck in this problem, what can they do? Where and how can we effectively tap in to acquire needed technical counterpart?<p>Thanks HN,\nGuruDL",1305050957

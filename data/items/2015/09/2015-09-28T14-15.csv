Handling a group of people as a society is easier to handle in the background since it&#x27;s more about who you know not what you know about them in precise form. In a one-on-one setting you&#x27;re responding to continually changing behaviors of that person (day-to-day life changes like mood, health, and so forth). In that situation you have to put all your effort to focus on them. It&#x27;s why some people are better at picking up those cues than others (personal example for me would be not picking up on when someone is feeling ill or down about something). The more you get personal with someone the more you have to get to know them, basically.",1443452363

But I also have to fill out weekly time cards and account daily for the time that I work.  My pay is even calculated by the hour.<p>The way salary used to work is that the salaried employee would answer some weekly questions.  Did you work this week (yes/no)?  If no, are you using one of your remaining vacation weeks (yes/no)?  If the answer to either question was yes, the employee was issued a check for 1/52nd of their annual salary.  If not, there might be further questions about unpaid or partially paid leave categories, or sabbaticals.<p>But now we have this bizarre hybrid with salaried employees logging their time by the hour, and with PTO balances instead of sick leave or vacation.  On top of that, many of us at &quot;at will&quot;, and can be fired at any time, for any reason, or no reason at all.<p>In my situation, I don&#x27;t even have a contract, and it is obvious to me that I am only &quot;salaried exempt&quot; as a flag of convenience that allows my employer to skirt around certain legal protections for wage employees, most notably overtime pay.<p>As such, I&#x27;ll invent anything I like when I&#x27;m not on the clock at work.  My obligation to my employer starts and ends with the daily ration of working hours.

Doubly so if you used a &quot;Disk Doubler&quot;[2].  The 3 1/2&quot; were pretty nice after the 5 1/4&quot;, but I&#x27;m still not sure they were ever as good as the 8&quot;.  I&#x27;m glad to be rid of the whole lot of them with USB Flash drives.<p>I will say it was quite exciting to buy an Indus Floppy Drive for my Atari 400 (upgraded to 48Kbytes).  It was amazing going from the 410 cassette player to the floppy.  The door popped up in a most satisfying manner.<p>1) I&#x27;m with the other posters that &quot;tried and true&quot; and &quot;know quantity&quot; is probably a better way to look at it.  Also, the stuff using the floppy drives probably just works.<p>2) for the younger crowd, at one time 5 1/4 floppies came in single sided and double sided varieties.  So, depending on the floppy drive you bought the correct one.  The price wasn&#x27;t all that different.  5 1/4 floppies have a notch on the side that tells you how to insert it. Put it in wrong and the drive won&#x27;t close since part of the mechanism goes down through the notch.  Now, some &quot;genius&quot; decided that if you had a single sided drive and cut a notch in the other side of the floppy you could use both sides of the disk in much the same way you could play both sides of a record.  This &#x27;genius&#x27; started selling a device that was basically a hole puncher with a metal attachment that held the floppy properly to punch the hole (really a small square punch).  You then could use both sides.  Now, inserting the disk upside down would work, but the disk spins the opposite direction.  You can guess how this interacted with the fabric that removed dust built into the floppy.  <a href=""http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue10/036_1_FLIPPING_YOUR_DISK.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue10/036_1_FLIPPING...</a> is an old article on it and Wikipedia has pictures <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk_variants#Flippy_disks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk_variants#Flippy_di...</a><p>Serendipity is an amazing thing, as I type this &quot;I&#x27;m Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)&quot; just started playing on my music player.

The security folks have things locked down to such a degree that developers don&#x27;t have root access to their own machines and the process for getting new software approved for use on a developer machine takes months. We just got permission to have git installed, for example. Getting Nodejs installed probably isn&#x27;t going to happen unless they could figure out a way to disable npm. All ports to the outside are shut down except for 80 and 443 and everything runs through IronPort, so anything running https has to allow you to not verify SSL.<p>If the latency/general performance is good enough, I think developers would love to use something like this for their primary development environment.

Even for approved, out-of-patent drugs, it&#x27;s still expensive to get a new generic instance approved, and for drugs that have few users like this, it&#x27;s just not worth it for a new supplier to get it.<p><i>Generic drugs don’t need the excruciatingly drawn-out safety and efficacy studies required of new brand-name medications, but they do need to pass a bioequivalency study proving that their drug is absorbed the same way as the original.  ... it’s just too hard to start making a generic medication. If all you want to do is synthesize an active ingredient in powder form, and you’re not too concerned about staying on the right side of the law, it costs pennies and takes however long you need to FedEx something from China. If you also want FDA approval, it costs $2 million and takes two years.<p>Remember, Daraprim is used by about 10,000 people per year, and before the recent Turing price markup, it cost $13.50 per pill x eighty pills per treatment. 10,000 x 80 x $13.50 = about $10 million per year, of which maybe $5 million was profit. That means you have to capture a big chunk of the Daraprim market before it’s worth trying to get yourself approved to make Daraprim; the FDA is essentially telling pharma companies to “go big or go home”. Nobody wanted to go big, so they all went home.<p>In the absence of this barrier, it would be easy for small boutique companies with a couple of chemical engineers on hand to spend a few weeks manufacturing a few thousand doses of the drug whenever it was necessary to meet demand.

Just a month ago I got to hear a more correct description from a biologist friend, which sounds much like Bunnie&#x27;s implementation:<p><i>In order to capture the wonderful diversity offered by sex, I implement quantitative traits in the light genome. Instead of having a single bit for each trait, it’s a byte, and there’s an expression function that combines the values from each gene (alleles) to derive a final observed trait (phenotype).</i><p><i>By carefully picking expression functions, I can control how the average population looks. Let’s consider saturation (I used an HSV colorspace, instead of RGB, which makes it much easier to create aesthetically pleasing color combinations). A highly saturated color is vivid and bright. A less saturated color appears pastel, until finally it’s washed out and looks just white or gray (a condition analogous to albinism).</i><p><i>If I want albinism to be rare, and bright colors to be common, the expression function could be a saturating add. Thus, even if one allele (copy of the gene) has a low value, the other copy just needs to be a modest value to result in a bright, vivid coloration. Albinism only occurs when both copies have a fairly low value.</i><p>Also, Bunnie&#x27;s blog has a great awesome to noise ratio.

It doesn&#x27;t mean that no country in the world has issued a patent which could conceivably affect your ability to sell a product.<p>The other thing to remember is that most companies find the presence of a licensing model reassuring because you know the costs up front, as opposed to finding out when someone sues after you&#x27;ve shipped millions of units. That&#x27;s one of the reasons why VP8 never posed a threat to H.264 – it was almost certain to get bogged down in lawsuits if it became popular – and why HEVC Advance is arguably the biggest threat to H.265 since it removes that comfort zone.",1443449201

526109,comment,525726,525726,0,0,metachris,,,"very interesting paper...<p>at point 2.2 ""bulk guessing of passwords"", he says ""even a 6 digit PIN yields at most a 1% probability of success to 10 years of brute-force attack"".<p>i hardly believe that can be true. it's just 1 mill. (10^6) different passwords. if a website does not protect the login site with time-delays or otherwise (let's say we can test 5 pins a second), all passwords can be tried in 138 days. if it's only 1 pin per second it will already take 694 days to test them all.<p>and of course there is a 50 % chance to find it in half the time. and 25 to find it in the first quarter, etc.<p>furthermore at the end of point 2.2, i read 10 million requests. why? 10⁶ is one million, and a 6 digit pin has 10⁶ possible states, right?",1237640215

526107,comment,525866,525866,0,0,dhotson,,,"Disclaimer: I used to work at hitwise.<p>All of these analytics services have some bias.. Google only measures traffic to their site, whereas hitwise compares things in more relative terms.. I.e percentage of all searches (all search engines). Hitwise has an advantage because they collect data from ISP's, but the bias is that they don't collect data from all ISP's.<p>Anyway, I hope that helps to clarify.. And I still think techcrunch are full of shit. :P",1237640158
526106,comment,525067,525269,0,0,jlees,,,"Yes, this is my biggest tip as well. All the best intentions in the world won't help you change for good - in my experience. Though having said that, even something voluntary like going to the gym might not be enough...<p>The two things that worked best for me were:<p>Organise every meeting you possibly can to be in the morning, and don't allow yourself to cancel.<p>Go to bed with something unfinished, i.e. have something to do that really propels you out of bed. An example would be leaving a piece of code not quite done, but with a good idea of how to finish it (if you haven't got a clue, it's more likely to make you want to stay in bed and make it go away, no?). Thinking about the problem while dropping off and waking up makes me just want to leap up and fix it.<p>Other tips, potentially irrelevant to most commenters, but that worked for me:<p>Give up WoW. Or at least stop playing it late at night. Seriously. The difference in sleep quality, for me, is night and day.<p>Hack your nutrition. Eat low-GI. Cut out soda and junk food. Let caffeine be a treat, not a staple.<p>Have a flatmate or loved one poke you awake. Even if they're not geographically present, having someone you love call you or tuning yourself to wake up to the sound of an incoming IM can help you boot up faster in the morning.<p>Read in bed, but don't read anything too interesting. I still have this backfire when I open a new book at 11pm and don't sleep 'til it's finished. Others love to journal instead, which can be a great relaxer, but I end up making todo lists which has the opposite effect.",1237639993

The two are by definition complementary rather than mutually exclusive, so where is the competition?<p>Your comment seems to be based on a defensive kind of thinking where everything comes down to iPhone vs. the world -- ""either you're with us or you're against us"".<p>In this case I feel that it's entirely unjustified, and overall I believe the iPhone community might benefit from a more open attitude towards coexistence and collaboration with others in the mobile space. Everyone who doesn't support your preferred platform to the exclusion of others is not automatically an enemy to your goals.",1237639151

This point alone - for this article, in particular, - makes the entire of his blog post ... moot.<p>- Flickr\n- Facebook\n- Yahoo\n- Delicious\n- Wikipedia\n- Digg<p>One of his main points is that PHP is not good for large teams.  I'm pretty sure the combined size of all those sites teams is nothing short of <i>massive</i>.<p>Really, it's 2009.  Bragging about frameworks is like bragging about dick size.

A 30% return on $1 billion is $300 million. Basically, unless you land a Google-like winner, it is very, very hard to get a $300 million return.""<p>The writer has no idea how a fund works or how to calculate returns. That statement assumes the lifespan of the fund is one year, which it isn't. The lifespan of a fund is usually 5-9 years. When you hear about Sequoia returning 140% on their 2001 fund, that is <i>per annum</i> over the life of the fund.<p>So going by the $1B example. If you have $1B to invest, and have set a target of a 30% return, you need to return $300M <i>each year</i> to your investors. That is almost impossible in years one and two (and even three) so its usually a curved path of returns (that dies down towards the end as the last investments are either killed off or sold for scrap).<p>As for fee's:<p>""Ahem, 2% of $1 billion is $20 million, which should be enough for a coupla Partner Ferraris. ""<p>The 2% fee is also <i>per annum</i>. Most funds are not $1B, but they are $150M - $500M, so the fees can really build up. The better funds wont charge fees in years where there were no returns or heavy losses, or in the later years of a fund.<p>As for the actual interview - not much substance there either.",1237636827

77890,comment,77859,77859,0,0,e1ven,,,"My guess would be a combination of IP checks, and Obscurity.<p>There isn't much incentive to auto-spam a site that not many people know about; It's much quicker just to have an intern do it manually, if that's the way you swing.<p>The thing is, News.YC is a pretty small and focused community.. There's not much advantage to robo-spamming it. It'd be obvious what you were doing, and the people who were reading it would just ignore you. Since you'd likely be the only fool to attempt it, PG would probably notice and just ban the IP.<p>",1194620177
77889,comment,77853,77853,0,0,dhouston,,,"i don't know if 'old browsers' is the target market, unless there's some funny niche somewhere that can't upgrade their browser. <p>maybe a neighboring idea would be creating a proxy for low-bandwidth devices -- e.g. transparently compressing/downsampling images, CSS, JS, HTML so that browsing on EDGE is a little more bearable with an iphone or other mobile device. (this might already exist, but i haven't heard of anything like it)<p>although i guess that wouldn't really use your imagemap hack  or screenshot tool :)",1194619949

77883,comment,77853,77877,0,0,e1ven,,,"Screen readers won't work- True. But keep in mind, this isn't a primary design for any site.. It's a work around for un-supported browsers. People browsing with a screen reader would probably be using something which gave a user-agent of IE6 anyway.<p>Alternatively, if you really wanted to ensure that it supported people who it isn't intended for, you could always include the text of the page you're Translating at the very bottom, as black on black in a 1 pt font. The Screen Readers would still pick it up.",1194618263

You could easily have a UI toggle that says ""Move mouse to"", versus ""Click on"", when you press a X,Y on the screen.<p>Granted that isn't as clean as it could be. How would you solve it?<p>",1194618017

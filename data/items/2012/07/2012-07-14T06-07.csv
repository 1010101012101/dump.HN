4243428,comment,4243232,4243232,2,0,Zenst,,,"I have noticed alot of information/articles upon wikipedia get deleted/flagged for deletion at a rather zelous rate and in that I have one question: WHY, if they are not superceeded or and made redundant then personaly I feel they should never be removed.  This may be some form of gender bias, though I have not looked up male sports items upon wiki.  The dress does have a nice backstory from what I read in the news and was a pretty big historical event as far as wedding go and in that factualy it will not be superceeded in that regard.<p>So the question is realy for me is wikipedia a source of knowledge/history/facts or is it biased towards flavour of the month(FOTM) and if it is the later then perhaps they need to revaluate there priorities.<p>As to a solution, maybe they could have all articles that are flagged for deletion, need approval by one male and one female.  Though in that I will say that some males have a female mindset and some females have a male mindset and in that they should be able to express and vote based upon there mindset as apposed to some physical gender.<p>There is no golden solution though I do feel the zelous removal of articles be curtailed and a approach of only removing non-factualy/incorrect articles be the approach taken and in that, there will be less issues and references to items that have been removed.<p>I hope they resolve a amicle approach or I fear they will only spawn a womenpedia based site for women only and that would be a sad day and a true wakeup call to the insanity and directions being taken.  Look at business for examples how issolation impacts - you will see many females who state they promote women in business and yet you never see a man saying I promote males in business.  One is accepted and the other is sexist.  But sadly they mearly add fuel to the issue and instead of addressing the issue, I personaly feel they exacerbate the issue.  Though if you were or felt persecuted - you to would stand up and do something about it, if you were strong person.  Not all people are strong in defending there morals and fairness and in that it does highlight women are just as right to feel persecuted.  Though I do wish the approach of ""Supporting fairness in buisness"" was adopted as apposed to ""Supporting women in buisness"" was the standard they promoted as it is just that - about fairness and that can and does work both ways on many level.<p>Much respect to Mr Wales for spotting this issue and taking onboard, a true sign of a fair person.<p>I also have no interests in make-up and wedding dresses and the like, but I fully respect they are facts of the World and in that have as much right as any linux distro to be there, I'm not forced to look up those articles, nor am I forced to read linux distros on the site but having that option is something I compeletly and utterly support and to do otherwise would be unfair and that is something that I feel uncomfortable with and hopefully this clear and documented bias can be eliminated in any form it takes in life, be it race, sex, orientation or origins.  We are all humans and in that we strive to be better every generation we spawn.  Humanity is wonderful when it works and aporant when it fails.  Lets stand up and count everybody.",1342249051

InDy lets you manage the entire lifecycle of method dispatch at a particular call site in a way that HotSpot can optimize across. This lets you define your own dispatch semantics that can potentially do things like complicated argument conversions (e.g. rolling all of the arguments up into an array) and it will still dispatch as fast as Java. This is true because InDy lets you define your own polymorphic inline method caches at call sites, so you can have a slow lookup for a method handle which is cached and invokes as fast as InvokeVirtual the next time it's called.<p>HotSpot can also inline code using InDy just like it can inline virtual method dispatch in Java. This lets the JIT compiler optimize across several methods, potentially implemented in many languages, as if they were a single body of code.<p>InDy will play a particularly important role in JDK8, where it's used to implement lambdas.",1342248973

It's possible our freeways will be segmented such that automated cars can go in certain lanes (perhaps even barrier protected) while the remaining traffic stays in other lanes / roads.<p>Traffic, or more specifically congestion, is primarily caused by excess cars on any edge (road) in which it simply takes N+1 cars to cause. Inconsistent driving patterns cause effective waves of inconsistency down the pipe exacerbating the situation (stop and go traffic actually makes congestion even worse).<p>Thinking about the overall network at a higher level makes all of this even more exciting. Consider the scenario in which N cars are on an edge with capacity N. If your car was about to enter the road you would basically contribute to traffic. This cost, C, is then felt across N+1 (don't forget to include yourself!) people at a minimum which is C*(N+1) minutes of human time that is lost.<p>If our cars, and ourselves, were better informed you might take an alternate and sub-optimal route that taxes you an extra T minutes but the overall network of time is optimized. Perhaps you'll even get a reward for it. And perhaps the reward is simply allowing all the people currently on the road a faster commute home so they can be with their loved ones.<p>Beyond that, as people have mentioned here already, the faster we can go and caravanning (which can be done safely by allowing cars to attach to one another in train format) improves overall throughput (and make traffic less likely).<p>Finally if we think about traffic, it's really just load and it needs to be distributed better across all possible routes and time. We have commute hours, but one thing to think about is that with a self-driving car I can leave to LA at 12AM and get there at 6AM while sleeping in the back of the car.<p>Self-driving cars will increase utility on vehicles, but also on time for travel routes ideally. This will spread the load (since humans generally have some biological clock they operate by) to utilize the 24 hours a day we have a little bit better.<p>And if your car can't speed I guess we should invest in really good alarm clocks and reminders :)",1342248005

I can't prove it, but it is what my gut feeling tells me.<p>And why would you want to?  Of course, for typical highways it is obvious that it would probably be both faster and safer to have some sort of mandatory cooperative autonomous mode, but even that will be hard to achieve.  I've met some of the people who work on developing and standardizing certain inter-car protocols to solve these types of problems.  Most of the people I've met are neither brilliant nor capable.  For the most part they illustrate to me a) how hard the problem is at scale (ie. get all manufacturers onboard) b) there will be a lot of idiots involved in this which means it'll take an <i>awful</i> lot of time to even come up with even baseline systems for proper crash-avoidance -- nevermind the real-time dynamic systems for controlling masses of fast-moving vehicles.",1342246277

Their vehicles are allowed to exceed the speed limit by 5%-10% in order to keep pace with a car in front of them. They do this because currently there are few things as reliable in terms of road information as another car being driven by a human. So the code makes an exception basically saying that its better to break the speed limit in order to be able to do the lazy thing and follow another car.<p>Having worked on an autonomous car and competed in the Urban Challenge I can attest to the safety of these vehicles. They truly can navigate obstacles that are withing 2-3 inches of the car reliably and confidently. The other interesting thing is that highways are in many ways one of the easiest types of road to drive on. Highway driving while fast, is very structured. There are relatively few rules to follow and they are rarely broken. For this reason I believe highways will be the initial realm of autonomous vehicles and that they will be allowed to drive at higher speeds(perhaps under the guise of human control of the speed in order to shift the blame to a human party.)",1342245720

444431,comment,442544,442544,0,0,AndersFeder,,,"Many interesting thoughts here. A few comments:<p>It is very difficult to make a launch vehicle powerful enough of your own. No matter how you do it, you will need a good deal of propellant for lunar transit, descent and landing. This means the launch mass is bound to be relatively high. Also, your launch vehicle has to be capable of reaching orbital velocity (approximately mach 22). Even the best amateur rockets, to my knowledge, have only achieved around a fourth of this velocity, and that is with no payload.<p>Ion drives aren't practical for a mission like this for a number of reasons. For a full discussion of why, please see this article: <a href=""http://openspacex.org/2008/10/06/escaping-the-grip-of-mother-earth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openspacex.org/2008/10/06/escaping-the-grip-of-mother...</a><p>If you are interested in having your ideas seriously considered, please consider joining Team FREDNET, an open source team in the Google Lunar X PRIZE.

444416,comment,443913,444201,0,0,sielskr,,,"At the time of my comment, my comment's parent has 4 points, so it is not only the author of the parent that I am responding to, but also those who upvoted the parent and those who have expressed similar sentiments here in the past.<p>First, I think a person has to be a little crazy to spend all his time on a venture with a 99% chance of failure.  No woman for example is going to stay in a committed relationship with a man who has a 99% chance of financial failure and poverty, so what do these one-percenters plan to do to get into or stay in a relationship: lie to their partners about a fundamental part of their financial reality?  (And I think that most heterosexual men who do not even want to be in a committed relationship with a woman are a little crazy.)<p>But probably these one-percenters are adults, and have the right to embark on this kind of career, even if I would not want it.<p>Would the reader however want to be a business partner, employee or even a coworker of one of these one-percenters?  I for one would prefer for my business partners, employees and coworkers to look for ways so that as many people as possible enjoy a prosperous life.  I would prefer for my business partners, etc, to help to shape their industry and their profession in that direction.<p>The most valuable things I own are my life, my freedom, my health and my education. Health includes things like enriching recreational activities and a full social life, and in expensive places like the Bay Area, that requires a certain level of income.  Good educational environments do not come cheap either.   But to maintain my life, my freedom, my health, etc, requires only a middle-class level of income: it does not require wild Netscape-scale personal success.  Not that Netscape-scale personal success is <i>evil</i> or <i>wrong</i>, but again the most valuable things a human being owns do not require it.<p>When I say this, I understand that risk and unequal financial outcomes are a natural and unavoidable part of the efficient organization of the economy.  Also, I do not endorse socialistic means for equalizing financial outcomes, in which the government takes income from successful workers against their will and gives it to less successful workers.<p>But when it can be done without decreasing the efficiency of the economy and by voluntary transactions, I think we should structure our industries and professions and markets and institutions so that an ordinary person willing to work hard can earn a good living with as little risk of lasting poverty as possible.  In contrast, it seems to me that a significant fraction of the commentators here <i>prefer</i> winner-take-all contests even when there are alternatives that produce just as much total wealth.   I for one will choose not to partner with that fraction of the community.<p>Let me give an example of a way to help more people earn enough money to maintain and protect the most valuable things a person owns (his life, his health, etc).  Founders can increase their odds of success if they have more information on what founders before them did and how successful those choices ended up being.  So anything anyone does to share true information about that or encourage others to share true information about that will tend to increase the number of founders who can earn a decent living at this startup game.",1232603116

I don't know if I've seen anything recently claiming decline in Facebook.<p>I think Twitter seems to be hitting a sort of limit.

Most of my extended family is now on Facebook, aunts and uncles and grandparents included.",1232602617

Having been through this countless times, it <i>always</i> seems to be a bigger than expected drain on the entire company.<p>Depending on the amount of space being leased and cost, sometimes it's just not worth spending weeks haggling or ending up in a short-term lease or sublease that means you're going to have to do it again in a year.  Especially if that time and energy could be spent on improving your business instead.",1232602549

Maryland.<p>&quot;If the Government were suddenly to announce on nationwide television that all homes henceforth would be subject to warrantless entry, individuals thereafter might not in fact entertain any actual expectation of privacy regarding their homes, papers, and effects.&quot;<p>FYI: Smith V. Maryland is the justification the FISA courts have used to argue surveillance is legal. It argues, in a nutshell, that when you route phone calls through a telecom you are forfeiting your expectation of privacy, and therefore your fourth amendment rights.<p>I am concerned that the surveillance industry may be trying to establish the legal precedent that because everyone knows about the surveillance, it is legal. This is a paradoxical argument: the logic would effectively be that if they told everyone they were doing it ahead of time, it would be illegal, but since they told everyone after the fact it is legal.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not a lawyer. This is my laymans understanding of the issue and I don&#x27;t really have the body of knowledge regarding expectation of privacy to adequately discuss this. These are just the things that, as a layman, I am currently afraid of.",1388026675

I want to be explained that I am wrong, but I am not convinced by your argumentation.<p>Imagine a country of 200 people. They each work and provide products and services to one another. They gradually value the value of theirs service rendered and production. Then they need to easily exchange cows for shoes for houses for legal advice for whatever goods and services. They then come up with a way to value these goods and services for ease of exchange. So they say your one hour of work is worth $4 then you can easily take that and buy 1 hour of legal advice + 1 piece of bread and be left with 35 cents. That representation and value-holding entity is money as we know it today. It did not just appear.<p>Bitcoin is the EXACT opposite. 10 people come together in the 200 people economy. They decide they create pieces of cloth and give it a value of X. Then they make X amount of those, granted the task of creating them becomes harder as you go. Then as they create more, X magically is worth 1 lawyer hour today, 4 cows more tomorrow, etc... Then after creating these many pieces of cloth, and valuing them at X, then tell ME that I can exchange my car for it.<p>With what we have today as money, we created goods and services, then accepted to use that as a way to exchange, hence the entirety of the money in circulation was equal to exactly the amount of Good and Services rendered, debt, etc...<p>With Bitcoin, it is equal to nothing other than what a few people decided and did not create anything for it.<p>I am sure I am wrong, but that is just how I see it. Bitcoin could very well succeed, but the only thing this would mean is that everybody was duped.",1388026415

6965089,comment,6963755,6964076,4,0,sandGorgon,,,"Actually there is a singular reason for the tax evasion and it has nothing to do with people &quot;wanting&quot; something.<p>Real estate.<p>Some of India&#x27;s real estate is priced as high as Manhattan, but the sale process is murkier. The reported sale figure (for tax purposes) is much lower than the actual sale figure. This is very interesting for people used to Zillow - why would someone agree to a transaction like this? How does the actual exchange take place without any backing paperwork?<p>In fact, there are people who claim that there is a physical bundle of a few billion dollars that keep changing hands as people sell and buy real estate - pretty much a closed system. There have been many attempts by startups to pull a Zillow in India, but most of them failed (including one I was associated with).<p>Now here&#x27;s the interesting point about bitcoin - I mentioned above that the current real estate market is a closed system. The Indian govt has taken a series of rightfully justified steps to eliminate physical cash from the financial system - in India, you need to pay a charge to withdraw  cash from a bank and also fill in extra paperwork. This ensures no new cash enters the real estate system.<p>Bitcoin could potentially upset the system.",1388026405

It&#x27;s not an intrinsic property of fiat currency alone.

Unfortunately the optimizations work primarily on the Kepler architecture (Geforce 6xx, 7xx, and the GridGPU chips on EC2) and not the older Fermi chips that are so popular for CUDA/Scientific Computing. All that said those quoting khash figures still seem to be getting poorer performance than the GTX 580, so I&#x27;ve got no right to complain.[1]<p>In any case it is very commendable that someone is making an effort towards bringing nVidia GPUs performance in line with that experienced by AMD owners.

They are, however, both well supported and higher-order functions in particular are used in many places; Julia uses Ruby-style do blocks all over the place, and a lot of macros desugar to functional constructs. However, Julia&#x27;s primary paradigm is multiple dispatch. For more details on that, you can check out this presentation I gave at Strange Loop this year:<p><a href=\"http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/StefanKarpinski/b8fe9dbb36c1427b9f22\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/StefanKarpinski/b8fe9dbb36c...</a><p>Functional style isn&#x27;t something to embrace for its own sake. Lazy data structures, in particular, while elegant, require a very sophisticated compiler in order to have even remotely decent performance. Even with a sufficiently clever compiler, the performance characteristics of the resulting code tend to be extremely opaque and difficult to reason about. That said, sometimes it&#x27;s a nice way to express things and it&#x27;s quite possible to implement lazy data structures in Julia: see, for example, the Lazy [1] and LazySequences [2] packages.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://github.com/one-more-minute/Lazy.jl\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/one-more-minute/Lazy.jl</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://github.com/dcjones/LazySequences.jl\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/dcjones/LazySequences.jl</a>",1388024377

And this is actually <i>more</i> important than the government part; as evidenced by every fiat currency that has ever undergone hyperinflation.  You can pay taxes with bolivars in Venezuela; but everyone would rather have dollars.  The local economy runs almost entirely on bolivars; people are paid in bolivars, yet.. people want dollars.  Why?<p>You can buy things with bitcoin; you can trade it for labor, services, goods.  this begs the question of course.. why would anyone trade it in the first place?  This is what the &#x27;regression theorem&#x27; [1] tries to answer; not for bitcoin, but for everything that becomes a medium exchange.<p>The notion that money needs to be &quot;backed by&quot; something is just conjecture and a relatively recent idea.  It only comes about when we use fiat currencies; when gold coins were used, or cowrie shells in africa.. no one asked what a cowrie shell was backed by.<p>The real question is &quot;what makes bitcoin sound money?&quot;  Opinions differ on that and I will leave the question to the reader; but, there is no fundamental difference between a US dollar and a bitcoin in terms of &#x27;backing&#x27;.<p>A government decree is worth nothing if you don&#x27;t have sound money, and sound money is sound regardless of a government decree; again, this is evidenced by countless government-mandated currencies becoming worthless and bitcoin, gold, silver, cigarattes, cowrie shells, and rai stones acting as currency without anyone ever declaring them to be currency.<p>1. <a href=\"http://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Regression_theorem\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Regression_theorem</a>",1388024129

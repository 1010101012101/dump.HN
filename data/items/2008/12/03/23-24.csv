Just use __future__ imports and try the -3 switch to see deprecation warnings.<p>I am mostly curious how this will pan out on the Mac.  I've released a program that relies on the system Python, which has worked okay so far because the 2.x installations of each Mac OS X version are basically compatible.  I hope Snow Leopard ships with Python 2.6 as well (even if it includes 3.0), so that I have more breathing room and code doesn't automatically break. :)",1228348694

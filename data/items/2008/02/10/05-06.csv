112911,comment,112871,112871,0,0,boredguy8,,,"I don't know how this article made it up so high, but Google didn't beat AltaVista, it was gone long before that. Inktomi, which powered Yahoo! and HotBot's search for quite some time, displaced AltaVista primarily because it distributed searches across a network for faster results. Google, of course, displaced Inktomi with an entirely different algorithm.",1202622017

112908,comment,112744,112744,2,0,atlacatl,,,"Getting a .ca in Canada is very easy and pain free (I buy them all the time). This post is inaccurate, at best. There is no bureaucracy involved in the process, unless you consider receiving an email to legitimize your registration a bureaucratic process. In fact, it's not different from any other registration method where you have to verify who you are, surprisingly, via email.<p>And the ""Domain Registry of Canada"" letters are a scam; it's painfully obvious that they are. BTW, the emails you get from the lawyers of dead generals in Africa are also a scam.",1202621483

112903,comment,112841,112890,0,0,stillmotion,,,"I think no matter how hard Microsoft tries to beat Google at their game, it's not going to happen. Google has held the upper hand since day one. It's obvious they know the pressure points to their own company and they sure know what to do when someone thinks about beating them at their own game.<p>Microsoft is making the mistake of trying to beat giants in one market when they are already a giant in their own. I'm not sure how Microsoft wants to play, but I am certain this isn't going to turn out like a David vs. Goliath.",1202619993

Honestly, it reminds me of what would be the love child of Lisp and Ecmascript.<p>What really struck me was when I realized that I could get it to do Ruby style hash and array literals, from completely within the language.  Really cool stuff.<p>Also, doing a Markaby clone was remarkably (hah) easy.<p>Oh, and the Regex library is rather nice.",1202619859

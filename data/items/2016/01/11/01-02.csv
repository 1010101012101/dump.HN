Given it&#x27;s reflective of what a computer can <i>do</i>, comparing metrics such as Ghz or gigaflops seems superfluous in the context to the average user. During the exponential improvement in 80&#x27;s or the 90&#x27;s, it seems like we have hit a brick wall.<p>Not to say there hasn&#x27;t been massive strides of improvement over the last decade, SSD and GPUs in particular have been spectacular. But many consumers have the decision they&#x27;ed oven rather have a power efficient processor than a heavy duty CPU.<p>As developers it means being conscious of bloat and writing more efficient software. Already we&#x27;re seeing many libraries that are closer to the hardware or &#x27;metal&#x27;.",1452477584

I&#x27;m staying with it solely for that reason, the business model it uses was dead in the water two years ago and it&#x27;s in the die-off period - the project itself is just making efficiency savings on something that&#x27;s never going to be profitable again.<p>I&#x27;d choose to do so again, it&#x27;s never made life bad for me to choose to share closer company with the people I respect - and when the time to move jobs has come up, a few months ahead of the crash, there have always been plenty of friends in other companies that would put in a good word.<p>What has been a bad call for me has been to stay in bad company, for the chance to work on something &#x27;important&#x27; while management has been incompetent or peers have been markedly hostile. That&#x27;s contributed to some of the lowest times of my life.",1452477553

I often disagree heavily with the other side, but that doesn&#x27;t invalidate their particular perspective. It always comes down to some axioms each side assumes that are inviolate, in tandem with a personal utility function judging certain outcomes more important or more just than others.<p>Take pro-life/choice for instance; here I am personally very strongly on the pro-choice side, but I can&#x27;t deny that the other side at least has these points which they evaluate differently from me:\n- at what point do we consider an embryo alive and sentient? We reduce lifeforms to black and white like this all the time, yet we know there to be a wide range of grey in between\n- considering it is valid for people to consider a fetus as alive and sentient, where do we draw the line on saying it is okay to terminate its life?\n- even as we accept that it is okay to abort a fetus and a future potential life, does it not come down to a value judgment whether a woman&#x27;s right to her own body, and her right not be held in thrall to rapists, supercedes that of a potential human life?<p>Acknowledging an argument on its merits does not automatically put it on the same level playing field or &quot;elevate&quot; it to be equal to the other side. Some arguments can have holes picked through them and can be successfully dismantled if not substantiated fully against all attacks. But this can only happen when both sides play by the rules to evaluate each other objectively, without weaseling out and dismissing the other side with reductionism. Granted, you have no control of the other, and can&#x27;t compel them to play by your rules, but you will still be able to come to your own truths if you can internally argue on their behalf, and be more satisfied your reasoning for it.",1452476234

Log-scaled charts give perfectly fine “intuitive feeling” for anyone who is used to reading them. Which would include most people if log-scaled charts were more ubiquitous.<p>I am lamenting that they are not, because for many, many purposes they are easier to read and facilitate more useful intra-chart comparisons than linear-scaled charts. In particular, they make the slope of lines meaningful in many cases where linear-scaled charts do not. They also fit much more useful information about relative magnitude and allow us to read a couple significant digits of numbers across a wide range of scales. Any time there is more than 2 orders of magnitude difference among values a chart, a linear scale becomes nearly useless.<p>Reading charts at all is an acquired skill, and takes a lot more practice than you might expect. Just like doing arithmetic with fractions, decimals, or angles of a circle is an acquired skill, or driving a car is an acquired skill. If you study young children or people from non-literate cultures, you’ll see all kinds of difficulty reading linear-scaled charts.<p>Edit: here, I spent a couple minutes making a linear-scaled and a log-scaled chart of the wikipedia $/gigaflops table from elsewhere in this thread, using Matlab. See how much useful information you can get from the linear-scaled chart:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/A80Tr6V.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/A80Tr6V.png</a> <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/xG0mngX.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/xG0mngX.png</a><p>(On the log-scaled chart, if we penciled in a grid, you could get at least one significant figure out of each data point, despite the data spanning 11 orders of magnitude. On the linear-scaled chart, you get 2 significant figures for a single data point, but there’s no way to make any distinction at all between the rest of the values, which span about 8 orders of magnitude.)",1452474705

When you need more, learn the JS necessary to make it happen, and perhaps move beyond static and into more JS-front-end territory as needed.<p>2) Tap into your PHP memories and take a look at Laravel and specifically laracasts.com. I&#x27;m not proselytizing (I actually don&#x27;t use php or Laravel), but it&#x27;s a really solid framework with a vibrant and heterogenous community.

That&#x27;s why a lot of companies with bad reputation can still retain A+ talent (e.g. Amazon).<p>That said, people tend to have many different reasons for leaving a company.

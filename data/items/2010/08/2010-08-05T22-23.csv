I'm hardly qualified to comment one way or another about the ins and outs of startup financing- I'm willing to assume that he's got the facts right on those aspects of the essay- but one part of the essay stuck out at me like a sore thumb: (talking about YCombinator's ""competition"" with employers)<p><blockquote>
Nearly all customers choose the competing product, a job. Why? Well, let's look at the product we're offering. An unbiased review would go something like this:<p>Starting a startup gives you more freedom and the opportunity to make a lot more money than a job, but it's also hard work and at times very stressful.
</blockquote><p>I'd say that this represents about 80% of an ""unbiased review"". The missing 20%?

The only issue I would take is with the idea that funding terms will become standardized and the process routine. While, even as a lawyer, I would actually love to see this happen (we prosper right along with our startup clients and no one benefits from the waste that occurs with funding games), I have not seen this happen even as all sorts of standardized documents are now widely available to facilitate it. It can and does occur if the investors want to settle for terms protecting their basic interests but giving them no special advantages (what I call vanilla terms). That said, only the friendliest of investors will do this, and by ""friendly,"" I mean in relation to the founders, and this usually means only friends and family or perhaps an individual angel or two that has a long history with one or more of the founders and wants above all other things to help promote the founders' interests. The rest of the angels, and most certainly the institutional ones (so-called ""super angels"") continue routinely to press for special advantages of one type or other. With special advantages come special terms and with this comes lawyer review, back-and-forth negotiations, and the like. In this sense, absent a <i>huge</i> shift in the balance of power toward founders, I don't see purely standardized documentation and routine processing becoming the order of the day anytime soon. Others may differ, and I may be wrong, but that's how I see this based on considerable day-to-day experience in this field.

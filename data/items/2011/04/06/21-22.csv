People could share routes and rate them for what they are good for (ie motorcycles, seeing autumn foliage, straightaways good for speeding, etc).  Glad to see someone doing this and would love to see you expand it further.<p>My advice:  Don't give people a search box and return an error if you are going limit them to certain areas. You should either:<p>Remove the search box and showcase the limited content that you do have with a message which areas are coming next<p>or<p>Leave the search box open to any input and then prompt users to add their own routes in regions you do not currently have content for.<p>I'd also recommend a subscribe feature, so I can be alerted when new routes are added for cities that I am interested in.<p>EDIT: I'd also think about adding a feature that showcases key interest points along routes (The view at this point is amazing or try the peach cobbler at so and so diner).<p>Good luck",1302126904

This is the key bit for me:<p>""...in a well-managed organization, one President or CEO can structure roles such that everyone is clear about the business value they provide and can manage their effort accordingly.""<p>And once achieving this point, you neither change the people in the organization, nor do you change the direction of the overall effort. Life will be grand.<p>So 100% agreement on the goal of what every CEO/Founder is trying to achieve which is ""Structuring the roles such that everyone is clear about the business value they provide and can manage their effort accordingly,"" Keeping the organization as close as possible to that goal in the presence of change, the limiting factor of using people that happen to be available in the job market at any given instant in time, and with the added constraint of operating within a viable business model. Well that separates the good ones from the bad ones does it not?<p>It has been my experience that people who are not able to evaluate the relative contributions of others who are in dissimilar roles make poor choices.<p>When I read a comment like 'we value doing over not doing' in the context of leadership, I wonder under what set of constraints is leading a group or team not a form of 'doing'? I can't come up with a case where someone who was, as part or all of their role, leading, felt that the 'leading' task wasn't a form of 'doing.' I have also not experienced anyone who, was in a leadership or management role felt that 'leading' (or in our case 'managing') they were doing was 'less hard' or 'less useful' than technical work (designing, coding, debugging, Etc.)<p>However, I've encountered people whose experience is dominated by technical work firmly believing that managing or leading was both easier and had less impact than the technical work they were doing. And I've known managers who have been managers for most (or all) of their career and felt that is was harder and more relevant than what the technical people did who worked for them.<p>So, to my way of thinking, if someone does value 'doing' over 'not doing' (which is good) and they understand the different values between what managers do and what engineers do, then the question of 'vertical movers' vs 'horizontal movers' is not a cultural thing its a 'what do we need right now for the business' kind of thing.<p>It's like reading an article that says ""We had to fire Bob today because he came to me to say ask if he could spend more time on gcc, you see our organization is all linux kernel hackers and we like it that way."" And yet that pre-disposition to kernel hacking completely misses the benefits that can be achieved if you your compilation environment improves.

These immigrants will then vote and fight for a redistribution of the wealth (through social services, etc...). Simple market forces will tell you that this would happen.</i><p>I don't propose that states automatically grant welfare to any visitors; it's free movement that I claim is a fundamental right, not free money. Nor do I propose immigrants have automatic citizens' votes, not in any immediate time period. Nor that such welfare issues be up for a democratic vote -- they could be a constitutional issue instead.<p>I don't see how, with these qualifications, this leads to a collapsed welfare state. Without welfare guarantees (at least not for new immigrants), there's no selection tendency for rent-seeking. Instead there's selection pressure for hard-working people, living in states where their efforts are undervalued (because of broken government or broken economy).<p><i>On a side note, I believe that immigration discrimination is good. It allows minorities who are productive members of socialist societies (i.e. tax heavy) to flee in to countries where their skills are valued.</i><p>I think you've misunderstood your argument.

2417083,comment,2415160,2415643,9,0,mbesto,,,"20-40 employee bracket here! All of our employees are billable (sort of). It's hard to explain our structure but needless to say our CEO/COO/Operations Director/Consulting Director/CFO all work as a team and are never really limited to their ""designated"" positions. Our Operations Director has been billing on a project for 4 years.<p>Our company has an interesting dynamic. I would say everyone has the ability to ""speak up"" but we have designated management roles. I speculate there are some reasons for this:<p>1. Leadership - ""junior"" people need a certain level of mentorship. Many of them don't understand process and need managers to guide them on those processes. Hiring the quality of people (even at ""the bottom"") that your firms may attract is VERY difficult for the other 99% of companies like us out there. We simply don't have the whole techie seen watching our firm day to day and thus don't attract them to our company. Hiring SUCKS. Is that our issue? Sure. But this utopian business world isn't always possible -- even though we want it to be.<p>2. External client view - Our company works almost exclusively with blue chip companies. They expect to see CV's with years of experience and fancy titles like ""Principal Consultant"", ""Management Consultant"", etc. etc. With these titles comes the responsibilities of managing people. When I used to work for the largest biz software vendor in the world I remember there was a title ""Engagement Architect"". I was basically told that this position only existed because the client contact (mainly the CIO) needed a contact at our company that was on his same ""level"". Also, some people flat out do not have soft skills.<p>I think the overall point is this... this is not a lesson in how to run a better business. This is a lesson in how Jason is happiest in running his small business and wants to keep it a small business. Many of us love the agility of being in a small company and fear if we add more numbers we will lose that agility. (and that's probably true) 37signals has only increased it's employee base to 26 over 11 years. With the amount of press they have drawn there is no reason why this number shouldn't be 260. For the record, I'm not saying that it should be 260, I'm saying that they have probably favored higher profit margins on their existing employee base rather than to scale the business out vertically.<p>Fred Wilson once wrote ""Marketing is for companies who have sucky products."" In order to do this with 26 people, you need to find 26 very good people. Do you know extremely difficult that is to do? It's even difficult with just 2! Face it, most people SUCK at business. I applaud Jason (and others) who have had the fortune and ability to do such a thing.",1302125783

The oldest spent 1 year in a traditional preschool, but they've gone exclusively to Montessori school since that time.<p>What strikes me about this article is its characterization of Montessori schooling as largely unstructured and free.  I think it must be comparing it to a much over-structured methodology, perhaps like the public schooling I got growing up.<p>Styles vary somewhat among Montessori schools, but what I've seen is that in the early years, the age Montessori is most known for, there are specific materials children work with and specific ways they're expected to work with them.  A child may not get out a work he/she hasn't been shown how to use.  He must return the work to its proper place before selecting another one.  The materials aren't tools for self-discovery.  They're tools for letting self collide with reality until such time as the applicable real concepts are understood.<p>However, the one simple freedom of being able to choose a work does make it a sharp contrast from the lock-step style of education I grew up with.  I hear public schools aren't always this way, according to relatives who sent kids to public school in Lexington, MA.<p>In higher grades the emphasis on materials fades, but the basic idea of letting children work within a structure remains.  For example, in upper elementary (grades 4-6) the students develop their own classroom code of conduct.  They're given some structure about how to do it, though.  I see Montessori as a balanced methodology on the freedom/structure dimension, not an extreme.",1302124161

Yodlee does a good job in many areas (security questions, special phrases and images, secondary password prompt for ""riskier"" operations) but still falls short here.<p>I realize that my credentials need to be efficiently convertible to plaintext at runtime within their service. They still shouldn't be stored in plaintext (it shouldn't be easy for engineering and operations staff to see my bank password by just looking at a database dump) though. In any case, I took the leap of faith that I trust Yodlee to keep my bank credentials secret when I signed up for their service in the first place. This is not what I was talking about.<p>I realize they force you to enter your password first. This is good but doesn't mitigate the threat I had in mind in the first place. It's Yodlee's responsibility to minimize the risk their service poses to their customers. Unless they can be 100% sure that the person signing in with my Yodlee credentials actually <i>is</i> me they need to consider the implications if it's not. Off the top of my head here are two obvious situations where Yodlee's ""display plaintext password"" feature puts users at higher risk:<p>1. User accesses Yodlee from a computer (maybe theirs, maybe their friend's, maybe a public terminal) which has a keylogger installed on it.<p>2. User is not security-conscious and doesn't realize the implications of this feature. Thinking Yodlee is read-only (like most other competing services) they use a weaker password than they should or even use the same password for Yodlee as on other sites. They shouldn't but it's a fact of life that they do.<p>In both cases the attacker can get the user's Yodlee password and then all of their bank passwords. They steal all of the user's money. Banks are generally willing to play ball and cover users for their losses if their account <i>at that bank</i> is hacked. Will they step up in the same way if they're hacked via Yodlee? I'm inclined to believe the answer is no. I don't even know if the bank should be expected to.<p>When choosing whether or not to build a feature, you need to consider whether its benefits outweigh its risks.<p>Trusting Yodlee with my bank credentials to aggregate financial data is a risk but doing so is the entire basis for their service and provides me with a huge amount of value. It enables scenarios which are otherwise completely impossible.<p>This ""show plaintext password"" feature is a small convenience which doesn't enable any new scenarios and has some pretty significant risks.<p>EDIT: I'm aware of the auto-login feature but didn't bring it up because it's almost the same as displaying plaintext passwords. Practically speaking it's a tiny bit less bad because an attacker can't directly view the password and use it on other services (assuming again that users make poor decisions and use the same password everywhere). Either way I think both should be gone.",1302123843

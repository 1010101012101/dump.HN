This same thing is possible with political parties. For instance, the ""Nationalists"" or ""Communists"" or ""Fascists"" or ""Libertarians"" can be counted on (to a large degree) to adhere to their platform.<p>In parlimentary systems, ideological parties, like the above, can get represented, and often make up the shaky coalition goverments that hold power. With the right kind of backstabbing, Nazis or Bolzhevics can wipe out their allies from within and seize control. Just not possible in the US...<p>In the US's winner-take-all system, the parties themselves must compromise on their plaform, and generally aim for about 50.1 percent of the vote--they'd rather 60 percent of gun-lovers than 100 percent, because the latter is unpalatable to the rest of their members. <i>Therefore the crazy fringe of every issue is alienated.</i> The GOP and Democrats are <i>not</i> really restricted to a given platform. This is why ""GOP success"" can <i>never</i> amount to a Fascist takeover, and why ""Democrat success"" can never amount to a Communist takeover.<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i>* Suggestion:<p>When the admins see something as ""off topic"", perhaps they should enable a down arrow for that post only, allowing everyone else to decide for themselves.",1187470452

43881,story,,,4,5,epi0Bauqu,"Hacker News Posting Guidelines?",,"I am one of those users who welcome (at least the experiment) of broadening news.yc to ""Hacker News.""  However, if the last few days of postings are any prediction of the next n, then perhaps some Hacker News Posting Guidelines would be in order.  I think that there should be a link to them on the Submit Link page because new posters won't know (and old posters may forget) that the Hacker News announcement even exists.  PG's ""anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity"" maybe a good start, but I just don't think it is enough.  My suggestion would be to add:<p>No politics.
No old stuff.
If you post a question, post 1 not >1. <p>What else?",1187470126

43874,comment,43686,43869,0,0,rms,,,"A privatized educational system will fail the kids with bad parents even more than the current system. Even a bad high school education is a lot better than absolutely no education. With private education and no vouchers of any kind, a lot of kids just won't go to school which is terrible for us as a society.<p>I think it'd be great to privatize education but it still needs to be mandatory and free at a certain basic level.",1187468267

No one wants to share their backup hard drive, but they might share or even sell their MP3 player. The legit use for the MP3 player is probably legally safe, but things can get gray quickly.<p>Since this particular MP3 player can only hold MP3s, not arbitrary files, they should be required to implement a self distruct feature, even though a device that could store MP3s <i>and</i> files shouldn't need one.",1187467504
43871,comment,43847,43847,0,0,rams,,,"SVN has already lost mind share with the real hackers, the thought leaders like Linus Torvalds - It's the new COBOL of the open source version systems. The decentralized version control systems that are open source are really pushing version control systems in new directions.They are addressing important questions about the committer/non-committer divide, which SVN only perpetuates (at least with open source projects). <p>BTW,should corporate spiels be posted here ? I agree that Collabnet deserves some credit for sponsoring dev of SVN. But is this the appropriate forum for a post like this ? <p>",1187467218

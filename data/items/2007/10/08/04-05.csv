For example:<p><a href=""http://econpapers.repec.org/article/tafapeclt/v_3A11_3Ay_3A2004_3Ai_3A9_3Ap_3A587-590.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econpapers.repec.org/article/tafapeclt/v_3A11_3Ay_3A2...</a>)<p>In part it's because the empirical data supports their view, though there's obviously a retrospective bias and a chicken and egg problem - did good institutions result from economic growth or vice versa?

I've been working on it a couple of years, and I'm sure I'll be working on it for years to come.<p>I can tell that you have the drive, curiosity and the desire, though.  I think that's the biggest part of it.  \nEverything else is just learning and not putting your foot through the monitor the umpteenth time your code doesn't work. :)",1191819401

Google simply wants other handset makers to use their cell phone software (they dont charge any license fees, it is entirely ad funded). <p>I'm a bit disappointed they wont build special hardware but hopefully some of the good handset makers will adopt Google's software since it is open.\n",1191819171

The catch is that what creates the profit needs to be made / done this month. It's against the spirit of the contest to log income from elsewhere.<p>Also, this has nothing to do with my employment, nor are you giving me or my company anything. It's merely a ""profit pledge drive."" Self reported.<p>BUT: something like this, in such a short time, is best done collaboratively. That's the objective. It's a goal, and nothing more or less.<p>Edit: see update.",1191818624

Part of the challenge, I assume, is not inventing assumptions that don't exist.<p>I'll see how much capital I can get on short notice. Seed amounts (a few thousand for equipment like PCs and office stuff, base living expenses) I can spot. Office space too, though we're in the process of moving from a small office to a larger one, so I can't spot you a private office this month.<p>Real capital, what you would need to hire and whatnot... that's a process that takes longer than a month, so it's not <i>immediately</i> applicable. There's no reason not to raise capital, though.",1191817785

64611,comment,64475,64562,0,0,binarybits,,,"<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_surplus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_surplus</a><p>""Milton Friedman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and father of Monetarism, argued that many of the fears of trade deficits are unfair criticisms in an attempt to push macroeconomic policies favorable to exporting industries. He stated that these deficits are not harmful to the country as the currency always comes back to the country of origin in some form or another (country A sells to country B, country B sells to country C who buys from country A, but the trade deficit only includes A and B). In fact, in his view, the ""worst case scenario"" of the currency never returning to the country of origin was actually the best possible outcome: the country actually purchased its goods by exchanging them for pieces of cheaply-made paper. As Friedman put it, this would be the same result as if the exporting country burned the dollars it earned, never returning it to market circulation.""<p>It's worth keeping in mind that trade is not a race or competition. It doesn't hurt us in any way if Europe accumulates wealth quickly.<p>I think the idea that trade deficits are bad and trade surpluses are good is largely an artifact of the way we talk about it. It wouldn't sound as scary if Lou Dobbs talked about ""America's looming capital account surplus,"" even though a capital account surplus is logically equivalent to a trade deficit. Right now, foreigners are buying up a small share of our capital goods and sending us consumer goods in exchange. At some point in the future, those same foreigners will sell the capital goods and use them to purchase consumer goods from us. In an of itself, neither situation is something to be concerned about.",1191816422

Thoughts as to why?<p><a href=""http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/</a><p>Meh link:

<i>One of the biggest issues facing the oceans is a lack of awareness. You can't see what goes on in the ocean the same way you see what happens in a forest or in an African savanna. So people don't know that we waste 54 billion pounds of fish every year while 8 million people die of starvation. They don't know that every single fishery will have entirely collapse by 2048. Or that 90 percent of all large predators in the oceans are gone. And if people could see that. If people could see the amount of waste and destruction in the oceans they wouldn't stand for it for a second.<p>It should be noted however that perviously Dr. Ballard has, in the process of drumming up enthusiasm for increased funding and interest in ocean exploration, touched on the rich bounty of resources yet to be tapped beneath the sea floor. As always, the needs of man and nature are not mutually exclusive should we choose. Balance between the amazing scientific and educational benefits often described by Ballard and the interests of commerce can be achieved if we keep our eye on the prize.</i><p><a href=""http://roastedpinebark.hubpages.com/hub/Ocean-Exploration-Needs-More-Funding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roastedpinebark.hubpages.com/hub/Ocean-Exploration-Ne...</a>
<i>“The ocean is home to the greatest diversity of the planet.  It’s still ironic that there are more footprints on the moon than there are on the bottom of the sea, and we’re only 7 miles away,” says biologist Sylvia Earle (Marino).  Ocean exploration does not receive the amount of funding that it should, especially compared to the space program.</i><p><a href=""http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1202/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1202/1</a>
Answers me a bit:
<i>It is common for books on undersea exploration to include a throwaway comment about how we know far more about the surface of the Moon than the bottom of the ocean, or how more people have been into space, or on the Moon, than have reached the bottom of the sea. These comparisons are often not terribly accurate. Every year thousands of sailors travel under the oceans in military submarines, thousands of commercial divers work on pipelines, cables and oil rigs, thousands of hobbyists engage in recreational diving, and hundreds of researchers travel to great depths in the interests of science. Robots regularly venture where humans do not. What is usually fueling these claims is jealousy, or more politely, professional envy: the United States spends billions of dollars exploring space every year, and far less money exploring beneath the sea.<p>There are many similarities between deep sea exploration and space exploration, and also some important differences. Deep sea exploration has existed for nearly twice as long as space exploration, and followed a different path. But the differences are diminishing and the two endeavors are starting to look more and more like each other. More importantly, deep ocean exploration is having a major effect upon space exploration.</i>",1325295656

Uh, so, how'd that work out?  Spammers quickly figured out how to make a mockery of Bayes based solutions.  And who is still out there filtering spam using IP addresses & domain names?  Spamhaus.<p>Then, what really got his goat was back in 2005 (yes, long grudge holding, one wonders what he feels about the mail-carrier who lost a letter of his back in '78 ;-) when his vanity site, shared-IP-hosted at Viaweb which had become Yahoo! Stores was blocklisted at Spamhaus.  Back then, Yahoo, and Yahoo Stores were a spammer-hosting cesspool and Paul's page was wallowing in the center of it.  Rather than get to the bottom of it, Paul just got on a high-horse and ranted about the evils of Spamhaus.

Well, his paulgraham.com's email is filtered by Spamhaus, as is his ycombinator.com's email.  As are the emails of most of the social/blog sites he's on (posterous.com, etc.)  One wonder how many of these still use ""A Plan for Spam""?

However, he still hasn't had an important policy position as compared to his competitors for the presidency (excepting Bachmann). This is not a slight, but it should be acknowledged.<p>Now, I agree that he has had substantial power rhetorically. He has people who are passionate about what he says; his elucidations and opinions have influenced them, raised money, started conversations, and affected the political agenda. That is why it is disappointing that the very little power he has has been used inappropriately in certain instances. If he hired awful ghostwriters who spread stupidly racist material because he wasn't minding the store, then that is not a good sign that he has successfully managed the one area where he did have meaningful power.<p>Separately: I think you can critique Obama without mentioning things which seem to me untrue or at least misleading, which I think warrant correction:<p>- Obama has never (I believe) indicated that he's in favor of suspending habeas for U.S. citizens. There's misinformation around that NDAA does this; it does not. If you're thinking of something else, citation please.<p>- The U.S. torture debate has mostly revolved around waterboarding and unauthorized treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib, Bagram, etc. -- none of these are known to have happened under Obama. Some people believe that the Army Field Manual enables other forms of torture; Obama ordered a  full review and asked for all torture to be taken out; if you think he missed things, that's a complex judgement call, not a simple issue.<p>- On several other fronts, like the drug war, Wall Street, etc., Obama has in fact applied the policies he stated--I'm not sure what makes you think he's broken promises or compromised his sincere beliefs in any of these areas. He's not a libertarian (except maybe in comparison to H. Clinton).<p>""Batting average"" is a helpful term to use, but I think you're not using the right denominator: Paul hasn't been up the plate many times, whereas Obama, Gingrich, Romney, even Santorum have had a lot more opportunities to either accomplish something or screw up.<p>By the way, I'm not arguing generally that you should vote for Obama instead of Paul or whatever. But I am defending this newsletter ""scandal"" as a still relevant datapoint on Ron Paul. Not definitive, but relevant.",1325294245

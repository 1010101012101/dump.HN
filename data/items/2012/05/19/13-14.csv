3995924,comment,3992500,3992500,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""The goal of a regular text is to inform or entertain. The goal of Web copy (and ideally your website in general) is to get people to do something""</i><p>Good article, on the whole. But I disagree, slightly, with this point. At the risk of being cute, I'd say that the goal of <i>all</i> text is to get people to do something. Writing is persuasion. The particular end may change, but the means should always fit some end. Writing devoid of purpose is bound to be powerless. It's rambling. It's filler. It's extraneous.<p>Before writing anything, whatsoever, consider why you're writing it. Consider whom you're writing it for. Consider what you'd like that person to do, or think, after having read your copy. You need to be engineering an outcome. If not, you're basically gambling that your reader will stumble into something accidentally. Instead, leave nothing to accident. It doesn't matter if you're writing a cookbook, web copy, a letter to a friend, an email, or a science fiction novella. You're trying to get your reader from a point A to a point B, and the first step in doing so is taking careful stock of what A and B are.",1337435790

I was at a friends house when this happened, and rode my bike home shortly after this happened, not knowing all of this had happened (not a big basketball fan).  As I was riding my bike down Baltimore Avenue, two cops in riot suits were standing on the sidewalk beside the street, and when I was just square with them, they suddenly jumped at me screaming stop.  I almost lay down by bicycle as one of the cops tries to tackle me.  He managed to kick my back tire, and I skid to a halt and dismount.  They come up to me and point their 50mm canister guns in my face and start yelling in my face.  I smile at them and sort of laugh, and ask if there's a problem officer.  They say I was entering a restricted area, and tell me I have to turn around.  I point to the my building and they don't really care.  They say I have to turn around.  These cops don't get to go to riots very often, so when they do get the chance, they like to have as much fun as they can with it.",1337435777

3995912,comment,3989752,3994411,1,0,draz,,,"> One may argue that if she has no understanding of the European financial meltdown, and just wants to find evidence for the failure of the welfare state where there is none<p>There there. Relax.\nI was not arguing that the social measures were the only cause of the financial meltdown.  They are, probably, a contributing factor. You brought up Spain, which in particular, I am quite familiar with due to personal relations with a Spanish. Real estate was the major factor (as it was in the US), that is true. However, when Spanish citizens tell me they show up at the ER for a sore throat because the ER is closer to work/fit their schedule/whatever instead of setting an appointment with a doctor, I think that's a big ""social"" expense that could and should be avoided.  Why do they do that? Because it's free! So who cares, right? There's nothing wrong with providing free health insurance (and I'm a big advocate for it), but showing up to the ER without a reason should be penalized.<p>Also, when I hear that people who have no desire to work (because they're homemakers, for example) show up at the unemployment office simply to collect unemployment or just to be eligible to ""fun"" courses (to fill up their days), that's a social expense (in Spain, if you're unemployed, even for an extended period of time, the government will pay for all kinds of courses, be it knitting, accounting, or something else).  Those are expenses that affect a country's well-being.\nI AM all for these things.  But that's what I meant that they may have gone too far.",1337435448

You might just appear to be more cranky, or forgetful -- normal signs of aging.<p>2) Even for the person experiencing it, chronic hypoxia doesn't necessarily ""feel"" like anything. I was regularly getting my blood oxygen down into the upper 60s and as long as I had enormous amounts of caffeine I was good to go. Over time, especially after getting a CPAP, I realized to look for symptoms: skipping over words in the middle of a sentence and guessing incorrectly what they were, a more difficult time focusing (both mentally and with my eyes), and so on. Hypoxia in pilots has been studied over and over again, and no matter how hard you train, it still sneaks up on people and takes over. Scary stuff.<p>3)You do not necessarily experience an overnight resurrection when this condition is fixed. Many do, but many do not. Sometimes you just realize that you're now entering a long phase of recovery.<p>I can't adequately describe the emotional transition that goes with recognizing hypoxia and getting it fixed. There's a sense of joy, sure, but also a sense of fear: you realize just how close to death you were living, and how dependent you now are on a machine (or drug or whatnot). Living low on oxygen is a frightening and life-changing experience. Once I realized I was basically strangling myself every night -- passing out and then coming to over and over again just enough to be able to breathe again -- it dramatically changed my image of my body not letting me down. Hypoxia teaches that you can be severely broken in ways that you are not able to discern. Not fun.",1337433339

Another way to see this is basically that the corners basically divide the whole angle in many more parts in higher dimensions. For 2D, four corners cover the full 360 degree angle. For 3D, 8 corners. For a million dimensions, you can connect 2^(1mill) corners of different cubes to each other without overlapping each other.<p>So 'pointy' cubes reasons out the 'paradoxes' without resorting to 'spikey' spheres.",1337433027

That's about 4 orders of magnitude smaller than current systems.  Here is their last progress report on the STEPS project: <a href=""http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2011004_steps11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2011004_steps11.pdf</a><p>> <i>The most important part by far is to leave out anything you possibly can.</i><p>This is also the most <i>overlooked</i> part by far.  I deal with something similar at my day job:  I noticed that I am relatively poor at dealing with masses of complexity.  My co-workers fare better.  On the other hand, they don't <i>mind</i> small unjustified complexities.  The latest bit I saw was this (in C++):<p><pre><code>  class Foo {\n  public:\n    out_t1 bar(in_t1 in);  \n    out_t2 baz(in_t2 in);  \n\n  private:\n    static mem data;\n  };\n\n  // example\n  Foo foo;\n  out = foo.bar(in);\n</code></pre>\nAs it turned out, this ""class"" didn't have any state whatsoever.  There was `data` of course, but it was never modified after its first initialisation at program launch.  I devised a simpler interface (which happens to be backward compatible):<p><pre><code>  class Foo {\n  public:\n    static out_t1 bar(in_t1 in);  \n    static out_t2 baz(in_t2 in);  \n  };\n\n  // example:\n  out = Foo::bar(in);\n</code></pre>\nIt's not much, so they say it's no big deal, and act as if it does not count.  But it adds up quickly, often to the point where I can reduce the line count of a procedure by <i>half</i>, without even understanding the code!

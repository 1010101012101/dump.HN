611521,comment,610876,611451,0,0,rjurney,,,"Its not a silver bullet, but it is specifically designed for problems like Twitter's back-end issues.  If it can handle running telephone systems for years at a time with a large string of 9s of uptime, I think it can handle broadcasting SMS.  Well.  Its the most proven tool for this type of job and the only one I'm aware of designed from the ground up for building applications like twitter that are utterly reliable.<p>Not a case of magic, just the right tool for the right job.  You could code a web app in C, but why would you?  Making twitter in Ruby (and to a lesser extent Scala) is the same thing.<p>I clicked the profile link to your blog, and it looks like you have a lot of Ruby experience.  Compare the syntax for message passing between Erlang and Ruby.<p>id ! {my_fun,Args},<p>Thats it.  Passing messages between pids on nodes across a network isn't much harder.<p>Compare the difficulty of parallel computation and storing data in parallel across many systems reliably between Erlang and Ruby.  Doing that stuff in Erlang is just as easy as doing CRUD in RAILS, because the tools are designed to make it easy.<p>The downside is that Erlang is pretty bizarre and hard to learn if you've never coded in a functional language - you only get to set values ONCE, etc.  Thats a critical feature for debugging large pools of processes working together, but it sure is strange.  Which is why you wouldn't use Erlang to do a simple CRUD web app, you'd use RAILS.<p>Seriously... its an entire language based around passing messages between lightweight pids working in congress, across many systems, with built-in fail-safes for any failures, and a rock-solid distributed/redundant data store baked in.<p>In this situation its just about as close to a silver bullet as you will ever see.  Erlang would make writing twitter's back-end FUN.<p>A dozen crazy Swedish mad scientists slaved over a language for years to enable creating scalable applications like twitter trivial, only to be totally ignored by most everyone until quite recently.  And still twitter picks something else for the rebuild.<p>'Heavy metals poisoning' would seem to be a more apt metaphor than 'silver bullet.'",1242428230

611514,comment,609861,609861,0,0,anamax,,,"I find it interesting that these comparisons often focus on income and not wealth.<p>""In 1998, for example, the richest 1 per cent of Americans took home 14 per cent of total income, while in Sweden the figure was only about 6 per cent. Wealth concentration is another matter, however. The richest 1 per cent of Americans owned about 21 per cent of all wealth in 2000. Some European nations have higher concentrations than that. In Sweden—despite that nation’s egalitarian reputation—the figure is 21 per cent, exactly the same as for the Americans. And if we take account of the massive moving of wealth offshore and off-book permitted by Sweden’s tax authorities, the richest 1 per cent of Swedes are proportionately twice as well off as their American peers.""<p>And, income inequality doesn't always predict poverty the one one might think.<p>""What about poverty, not the same thing as inequality? Because inequality is greater in America, relative poverty is by definition also higher. But absolute poverty rates look different. If we take absolute poverty to be living on the actual cash sum equivalent to half of median income for the original six nations of the EU, we see that many western European countries in 2000 had a higher percentage of poor citizens than the US; not only Mediterranean countries, but also Britain, Ireland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden. Unemployment benefits in the US, often portrayed as derisory in the European media, are actually higher than in many European nations. Greece, Britain, Italy and Iceland spend less than the US on unemployment, measured per capita.""<p>(Note that the US seems to have lower unemployment rates so higher per-capita spending combined with lower per-capita rates produces even higher per-unemployed-person spending.  Yes, I realize that spending doesn't translate into benefits, that administration sucks up a lot of money, but that's a separable problem.)<p><a href=""http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10746"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10...</a>",1242427884

Price. Bootstrapped startup often can't afford professional design and cheap design often is crappy.<p>2. Misunderstanding. A much bigger problem. As I see it, design isn't just pretty decorations on your website or nice drawings in your app. It's a direct projection of your idea through a media similar to text. If you have a tight 1-4 person team that understands the idea very well, a foreign person might fuck it up.<p>What do you do without a designer?

What on your mind is that you try to rationalize and compare the stability the large company offering against the possibility of success of the startup.<p>Since you are young (I just assume so, I'm 24) and have few dependencies and debts, if I was in your shoes, I'd decide to work where my passions would want to work.  With the startup, you can make a much bigger impacts and have more freedom to create and innovate.  Bigger company provide you a more stable life, but do you see yourself working there for 1, 2, 3 years?<p>My thinking is that you can always get a job with a traditional company.  It's a matter of putting together a solid resume, working through the network of friends and recruiters to place yourself in the right place.

In a way, you can really learn a lot from working your way at the start up, wearing multiple hats -- these should be invaluable experience that you can brag about in your resume for future employees should you apply for a new job.

Based on what you said, this should be enough to get your house.<p>- benefits, retirement:  is there a chance for stock options?  For retirement, how about starting a Roth-IRA for yourself (you should do this anyway regardless)?<p>- health and dental insurance:  you can do some research so you won't get caught in emergencies without proper coverage, especially when you plan to have kids in the near future.

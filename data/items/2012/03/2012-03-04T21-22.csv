You could just make your point.<p>Also, I don't think you really got it right here. His point is that lots of functionality has <i>moved</i> from shell scripts to C. Yes, you have an ini-style configuration file. That's not the same as a shell script.<p>postfix took the simple-flat-config-file model whereas exim provides a much richer language. Some years ago I attempted to do something slightly odd for SQL auth in both, and found that postfix only let me use SASL, and SASL didn't have a driver for what I wanted, and therefore in order to make it do what I wanted I needed to write a C-based SASL driver to execute the SQL I wanted. In exim it was 3 or 4 lines of config.<p>Similarly, if I hit something systemd can't do I now have to write C to add a config file, rather than write a couple of lines of shell.<p><i>that</i> is what the author means.<p>I could certainly see an advantage to providing an ini-based approach as well for people who regard current LSB conmpliant init scripts as ""shell scripts that made no sense to me"" - and for people like me who -do- love them, but would be quite happy with a simple way to configure simple things.<p>But please don't try and take that power away from me when I need it.",1330897984

3664163,comment,3663746,3663887,17,0,tomku,,,"Anime groups can afford to be much more aggressive about technology because they have special requirements that older tech doesn't allow (styled softsubs, multiple audio/sub tracks, ordered chapters), and because their audience is overwhelming using high-performance PCs because nothing else commonly supports those technologies.  In fact, modern anime releases are basically targeted towards one platform (Windows PC with MPC-HC and CCCP[1] without DXVA) with coincidental support for Mplayer on Linux because it uses the same basic open source codecs and splitters.  Hi10p is even more aggressive - when they started releasing Hi10p releases, the only decoder that supported it was ffdshow alphas, and even now software support for it is very sparse.  Hardware support is non-existent, and will continue to be so unless a mainstream content provider like Apple decides to start releasing Hi10p video content.<p>On the other hand, people who watch non-anime scene releases are much more likely to use mobile devices, set-top boxes and other A/V equipment that relies on hardware decoding support.  One of the major reasons that scene releases are standardized is so that they'll play on a wide variety of hardware, and this results in a much more conservative approach than anime groups.  The main reason they're moving forward with this change is because H.264 has acceptable support in hardware (primarily in the MP4 container, MKV support is awful) and XviD is really showing its age compared to modern H.264 encoders like x264.<p>[1] - Media Player Classic - Home Cinema (<a href=""http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net</a>) and the Combined Community Codec Pack (<a href=""http://www.cccp-project.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cccp-project.net</a>)",1330897715

I wanted to continue consuming information on a device.<p>- I liked trying to make my iPad my sole device for communication (Facebook, twitter, email, IM, Skype.)

It's thinner and lighter than an iPhone from everyone who's compared the weight<p>- The Galaxy Note seems huge as a phone but small as a serviceable tablet.

But really the two are from different planets: their data models as well as their computational models are incompatible. For example, compare how databases relate data (foreign keys) to how spreadsheets do it (cell references). What do these have in common?  Basically nothing.<p>The point may seem esoteric, but there have been lots of attempts to combine spreadsheets and databases and they all run aground on this mismatch. Crude integration a la import/export works ok, but the perennial dream of having a true spreadsheet on top of a relational database is out of the question unless you sacrifice efficiency, which you can't. I do wonder sometimes how far you could get implementing SQL on top of spreadsheet data.<p>As an aside, it's interesting that the research literature on databases is vast and rich while the literature on spreadsheets (alas!) approximates nil.",1330897403

I can totally have a normal life, but I need to be a lot closer (than people with a normal vision) to text to be able to read it. This affects me greatly on my day to day as I'm a developer, and I need to be staring at text on my screen all the time. I can work just fine (larger font, screen closer to me, etc) but the biggest problem of all is, I tend to get my head closer to the screen a lot to see smaller text, consciously or not, and I have ridiculous neck and back pain as a result. I've been suffering this already for a few years. I've been to several eye doctors and all say wearing glasses or more LASIK wouldn't make a difference since ""my eye is OK"", and of course I've gone to every kind of back expert on Earth. All agree it's a posture issue (doh!) and while a good massage is a relief, the relief doesn't last  more than a few hours, so that's not helpful.<p>Has anyone gone/is going through the same? Any ideas what could I do to improve my vision?<p>I know all about ""stop working every X time and do this and that exercise to relax your back"", and would appreciate any ""amazing and not-well-known exercises"", but I'm mostly interested in improving my vision, if that's at all possible.<p>Thanks a lot.",1330896803

Marcus Felson, a professor at the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University, has concluded that lighting is effective in preventing crime mainly if it enables people to notice criminal activity as it's taking place, and if it doesn't help criminals to see what they're doing. Bright, unshielded floodlights -- one of the most common types of outdoor security lighting in the country -- often fail on both counts, as do all-night lights installed on isolated structures or on parts of buildings that can't be observed by passersby (such as back doors). A burglar who is forced to use a flashlight, or whose movement triggers a security light controlled by an infrared motion sensor, is much more likely to be spotted than one whose presence is masked by the blinding glare of a poorly placed metal halide ""wall pack."" In the early seventies, the public-school system in San Antonio, Texas, began leaving many of its school buildings, parking lots, and other property dark at night and found that the no-lights policy not only reduced energy costs but also dramatically cut vandalism.</i><p>I remembered it incorrectly, as apparently motion-activated lighting helps, but on-all-night floodlighting makes the situation worse.",1330896695

To create a new record, you then would have to build the record and then set the user_id and repository_id on the record.<p>Or, you can set user and repository to be accessible (attr_accessible :user, :repository).

Everyone else has been a non-developer/designer, non-programmer, or barely computer literate. What happened to me was at age 10 we got a computer and I've been absolutely obsessed with creation ever since.<p>This led to mannerisms, interests, and an external appearance adapted from my peers, but also to a quiet (though dominant) side of me that spends 20 of 24 hours each day pounding away at my keyboard.

The first is the ability to quickly share a test build of an app amongst the team for feedback and iteration. No downloads, no installs - just a URL.<p>The second is the ability to market your app to your clients or fans via your website or through Facebook, to get instant engagement (vs a banner/screenshot) to drive downloads. We&#x27;ve found it to be highly effective and the average app play is about 1:30. Hope that helps!",1376038729

6184436,comment,6182507,6183535,2,0,noloqy,,,"Interesting post.<p>I&#x27;m not fond of declaring her mentally ill based on the offenses she has committed. Clearly, she isn&#x27;t living an ordinary life, but plenty of ordinary people have used drugs, drank alcohol, trespassed and stole during the course of their lives. Prostitution might be a different case, but prostitution ultimately also is a choice. I can even imagine her shoplifting because she wasn&#x27;t able to obtain the necessary money through different means: nobody would hire her, and whenever she prostitutes she gets arrested. Also, it appears that she doesn&#x27;t rip out her veins when she isn&#x27;t incarcerated - otherwise she would be dead by now. Furthermore it is not uncommon for &quot;normal&quot; people who get arrested to be put on suicide watch. The tendency for self affliction perhaps isn&#x27;t so uncommon for the imprisoned.<p>I think that if the government would stop disturbing her in her daily life, a Pareto optimum would be reached. Naturally we have the moral obligation to kindly offer help with her problems - rehab, etc. - but shouldn&#x27;t have the right to force her into anything as long as she isn&#x27;t a menace to society.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is that the system now is turning her into a menace to society.

6184435,comment,6176222,6176222,1,0,catwell,,,"I am French and liberal, my views on economy are considered extreme liberalism in my country, but I when I read things like this I am even more thankful for our education system.<p>The French scientific higher-education system is weird and misunderstood even in other European countries, so here&#x27;s a (very simplified) explanation of the road I followed and how much it cost.<p>After high school, if you have good enough grades (say top 10%) you can enter something called Classes Prparatoires, which is a rather intense scientific (Math + Physics) preparation for competitive exams for the Grandes coles. It lasts two years, three if you decide to repeat the second year because you are not satisfied with your results at the exams (repeating the first year is forbidden, if your fail you have to go to a regular University - which is also cheap anyway -, but only 10-20% fail the 1st year).<p>There is a lot to say about how the way we are taught in Classes Prparatoires should change, but there is something right about them: they are <i>completely free</i>. Oh, and if you (your family) cannot afford rent and/or food, you can get funding from the government for this.<p>After Classes Prparatoires, if you succeed at the competitive exams, you get into a &quot;Grande cole&quot; (Engineering School). Studies usually last three or four years and you get a Diplme d&#x27;Ingnieur at the end (basically what you call MSc in the US).<p><i>All</i> the top Grandes coles are public and depend on different ministries (Education, Industry or Defense). The cost of studying there is below 1000/year. You can still be subsidized if needed, and you are encouraged (actually it is even mandatory) to make paid internships which pay for your studies. Actually, the two top Engineering Schools (Polytechnique and cole Nationale Suprieure) even <i>pay students</i> who study there.<p>Oh, and you are encouraged to go abroad. You can do an internship in another country or go there to specialize during your 3rd year. In my case I went to a British University to specialize in Distributed Computing. The cost of studying there is much higher but since I was a guest student from another European University I didn&#x27;t pay (except campus rent). It also works with the US, although I am not sure how: some friends did the same thing at Standford and MIT.<p>In the end, I got two MSc-s (one in France and one in UK), and my tuition fees for the entire thing amount to about 3000.<p>There are very few things I think a State should pay for, but top higher education is definitely one of them.",1376038130

That way, the receiving server wouldn&#x27;t see the plain text.<p>Silent Circle had a feature where people could upload their public keys to their keyserver and then Silent Circle would encrypt any outgoing email to that person with their key if it wasn&#x27;t already encrypted. Something like that, but more automated.<p>As for meta-data, when I looked at Silent Circles services, they were adding Received headers to email which contain the senders IP address.

In the middle of intense discussions about systems architecture it&#x27;s a real bonus to be able to get the numbers quickly and without suspending the discussion in order to punch things into a calculator.<p>They say that discussions go faster and are more free-flowing and productive because they don&#x27;t have to stop and start constantly.<p>Of course, I work in an engineering-heavy field, so my experience won&#x27;t be typical.  Even so, your question carries overtones of the &quot;when am I ever going to use this?&quot; question that causes math teachers all over the world to despair of ever getting people to understand that it&#x27;s not about the facts, it&#x27;s about the ability to think.<p>Being able to do mental arithmetic effectively is one aspect of being able to break down problems into small parts, and retain some pieces while working on others.  The skills involved are clearly related to those required in programming - seeing more than one way to do things, working through long chains of reasoning, combining tiny operations into large and complex calculations.  It&#x27;s plausible that practising those skills in small, concrete settings such as arithmetic can help foster the abilities required in larger and more abstract settings such as math and programming.<p>You&#x27;ll never need trig if all you ever do is flip burgers, but I use it all the time in computing margins of error in safety critical operation of 30,000 tonne tankers and nuclear submarines.

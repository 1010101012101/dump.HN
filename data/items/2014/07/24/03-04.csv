Gox told creditors he would consider returning the bitcoin that remains with the defunct exchange without converting it into regular currencies, people who attended a closed meeting with creditors said.<p>Some of those who had deposits with what was once the world&#x27;s largest bitcoin exchange welcomed the possibility of keeping the virtual currency unconverted, avoiding a potential drop in its value. But they also expressed their frustration with a bankruptcy process they say is taking place with little transparency.<p>Mark Karpelès, the chief executive of the defunct exchange was also present, despite saying he had concerns about his safety.<p>Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in February, saying it had lost 850,000 bitcoin, worth half a billion dollars, in hacking attacks. Only about a quarter of the missing electronic currency deposited with the exchange has been recovered.<p>The bankruptcy highlighted concerns over the regulation and security of bitcoin.<p>Some of the defunct exchange&#x27;s 127,000 creditors have been worried that the recovered bitcoin might be converted into dollars, euro or yen before being distributed to creditors at the end of the bankruptcy process. Many creditors would prefer to keep their share of the remaining money in bitcoin, since a large-scale conversion into conventional currencies would deflate its value.<p>&quot;The court-appointed trustee asked how many of us want to have the bitcoin returned as bitcoin, and about 70% of us raised our hands and gave a round of applause,&quot; said Yoshimitsu Homma, a Mt. Gox creditor. &quot;He said the option would be considered, though he added it wouldn&#x27;t be easy due to legal requirements.&quot;<p>About 100 creditors attended the meeting, gaining their first opportunity to talk with Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee who has remained largely silent while carrying out his duties. Mr. Kobayashi has made announcements via the Mt. Gox website, but his critics say his handling of the case lacks transparency, leaving creditors dissatisfied with his work.<p>Mr. Kobayashi has repeatedly declined to comment on any aspect of the bankruptcy process.<p>Mr. Kobayashi used the first 30 minutes of the meeting to explain the bankruptcy process and how he was seeking a sponsor to take over the operation of the business while continuing efforts to find more of the lost bitcoin, the people at the meeting said. The trustee spent the subsequent 90 minutes answering questions, though the people said Mr. Kobayashi didn&#x27;t provide any new details.<p>&quot;I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I&#x27;m totally disappointed with the meeting,&quot; said Kolin Burges, a creditor who staged a sit-down protest outside the Mt. Gox office building for several weeks starting in February.<p>Creditors had asked the Tokyo bankruptcy court to allow the proceedings to be recorded and posted online, as many creditors aren&#x27;t based in Japan and can&#x27;t make it to the series of meetings to be held at the court. But those requests weren&#x27;t approved.<p>No photography or recordings are permitted in the court building.<p>Another focal point during the meeting was the whereabouts of the lost bitcoin and the police investigation into the matter. Mr. Kobayashi declined to comment on that, saying he didn&#x27;t want to disrupt the investigation.<p>Mr. Karpelès briefly apologized during the meeting, in response to a request by a creditor, but said nothing else.<p>&quot;I am really sorry for what happened and will do my best to make the outcome of the bankruptcy as best as possible,&quot; Mr. Karpelès told The Wall Street Journal after the meeting. He said he had been worried about attending the meeting because of recent death threats he received. &quot;I really hope everyone recovers what they lost and that the culprit is caught,&quot; he said.<p>The next meeting, including an update on the bankruptcy process, will be held in November.<p>Write to Takashi Mochizuki at takashi.mochizuki@wsj.com",1406173895

How do these ~15,000 machines pick up new content? I assume they synchronize with the Netflix mothership every once in a while.<p>My question (without any intent to trivialize what Netflix is doing) is, isn&#x27;t that just a good-old caching system?<p>But it makes me wonder if it would be possible to create a distributed, localized caching system? For example, if I watch The Avengers, my machine could be configured to cache a part (or all) of the movie. The more people watch it, the more it is distributed. Since Netflix can correlate location data with what movies are watched, they can target certain areas to cache certain movies more aggressively. When the next person in my neighborhood watches The Avengers, they would pull part of the movie from me (maybe the beginning until the rest buffers) and cache another part of it themselves for the next person in line. That way all the people in my neighborhood or adjacent neighborhoods don&#x27;t have to pull the entire movie across the internet every time - instead, we help each other watch movies with higher quality.<p>On second thought, this may not be cheap considering the amount of development that may be required (and, at the end of the day, someone has to pay for this storage - although Netflix could, for example, offer personal mini-caching boxes in exchange for a monthly discount), but it&#x27;s fun to dream about a sanctioned, decentralized, peer-to-peer movie service.",1406172641

8078088,comment,8076919,8076919,7,0,spott,,,"So, I do a little bit of related research in this area:<p>This is typically called a &quot;filament&quot;, a &quot;plasma channel&quot;, and sometimes described as a waveguide.  It requires high powers (~10^13 W/cm^2, usually femtoseconds in duration) depending on gas.  It essentially works because the index of refraction has two nonlinear terms:<p><pre><code>    n(ω) = n_0 + n_2 I - n_plasma\n</code></pre>\nthe n_2 I makes it so that higher intensities (which occur closer to the center of the filament for a typical gaussian laser beam), have a higher index of refraction, causing the field to focus, increasing the electric field intensity at the center.  However, when the field gets high enough, it ionizes the material, causing a plasma to form, which has a negative contribution, defocusing the filament.  These two contributions balance out and cause a &quot;waveguide&quot; where the light essentially travels along a narrow channel, allowing the focusing pulse to travel longer without as much spatial dispersion.<p>You can&#x27;t send another light beam along these channels, because after the beam has left, all that is there is a plasma channel, which defocuses and absorbs light instead.<p>This has been around for a while.<p>What is NEW here is that they modified their beam profile to have 4 or 8 or even an annular ring of these plasma channels.  Accoustic waves propagate toward the center of this filament arrangement causing a change in the density (which changes the index of refraction, the index of refraction increases linearly with density) that makes the channels act like a waveguide for another light source.  This source of the density change has a duration of microseconds. When the acoustic waves have dispersed, a thermal gradient has a similar effect, and this has a duration of milliseconds.<p>They used this method to channel light from a spark source while mostly maintaining the spectra of the spark.<p>Now, what this allows, or doesn&#x27;t allow:<p>LIDAR is a possible use, but whatever you point this source at is going to have to be able to take 10^13 W/cm^2... and not a lot of materials can take that without breaking down.  While there is good focusing and guiding of the light, I think single photons are probably going to have a high probability of being absorbed (the mode of the photon will overlap into the plasma channels, which will likely absorb it),  The nice thing is that signals could likely travel through one of these channels (though there likely will have to be some dispersion compensation at the receiving end).",1406172167

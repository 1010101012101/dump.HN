2242832,comment,2242721,2242796,0,0,Kylekramer,,,"But this redesign just hides the normal URL bar behind a button. So, basically, exactly the same as things run now except a click away. If things function exactly the same as now, how can people not use it properly? Even in your example, if people were to type in www.nytimes.com, they actually wouldn't search and be directed right to the website. It is actually a net win over the typical googling ""facebook.com"" story. The only thing that supports your idea is that the URL bar is accessed by a button that says ""search"", but I can't think of a better name for that. ""URL Bar"" would just be confusing.<p>Of course, I also think this is a pie in the sky mockup that won't ever make it to prime time due to numerous usability problems, but who knows?",1298231989

2242828,comment,2242721,2242796,0,0,eco,,,"That was my first thought as well but after reading the article I'm not quite so conspiratorial about it.  Regular users do not understand or properly use the URL bar.  They may indeed want to do what you say but part of it is definitely just clearing up even more screen real estate and this is a fairly clever way to do it.  The URL will still be there but only when you want to see it.  If I'm understanding this correctly it'll be while the page is loading or if you click the tab it'll turn into a URL bar.  I'm a little torn on the idea because I like quick glances at the URL but it would clear up an entire row and I can still type/see the URL if I need to with an extra click.  I think I'll have to actually use for a few hours to decide if I love it or hate it.<p>I did just think of one problem though.  Phishing will be even easier so they'll really have to step up their detection and warnings for those.",1298231901

2242822,comment,2241638,2241786,0,0,wdewind,,,"I would replace scarcity of knowledge with scarcity of information/media in general and expand this to the entire media industry.<p>For years television companies paid top dollar for content so that they could create crowds for their advertisers.  Because there were very few people capable of even reaching a large crowd (ie: there were large distribution barriers), there was, relative to now, a scarcity of media in this arena.<p>Provided you got the right distribution, it didn't really matter what you put out there because there were so few people capable of operating at scale (again this goes for all industries, from Hollywood to journos).  I did a lot of consulting for Time Warner about 2 years ago, and one of the things I heard their executives say over and over again was ""We think there will always be a market for our premium content.""  They fundamentally failed to understand their business model: they thought it was providing high quality content to build crowds for advertisers, while in fact it had nothing to do with the content (the content was just the means, not the ends).  In this sense Google is their prime competition (same ends, far cheaper means), and is absolutely eating their lunch.<p>The other thing they didn't understand is that people simply don't have the hours in the day anymore.  If 10 years ago you watched 10 hours of television a week, it's likely you now spend some portion of that on Facebook, youtube, blogs or some other media outlet that we consider ""user generated.""  This hurt television more than the industry thought it would, again, due to the the fact that they were winning in distribution much more than quality, like they thought, and because as advertising approaches a zero-sum game linearly, the prices grow exponentially.  Now that it is easier to capture the long tail cheaply, and to more directly target consumers, what traditional media companies have offered (the distribution mechanism) is no longer valuable.  As a content filter, the publishing houses have always been crap, they just didn't know it.<p>The industry optimized years ago for this inability to hit the long tail: the information provided is extremely abstracted in order to provide mass appeal.  Taking NYTimes as an example, general news source dominance led them again to optimize for what they THOUGHT was quality winning: they hired the best journos they could find, instead of industry experts with writing skills.  When blogs allowed these industry experts to easily distribute their own work, the middle man was removed.  Now these companies are so big and have optimized everything from their recruiting processes to their syndication for this model: high quality journos, high quality content.  They are too big, and it's become very difficult for them to pivot.<p>This phenomenon is easily transferrable to almost all media industries, and is the general ""cheapening"" (I would call market-readjustment) of the value of media.  It turns out people have more specific taste than the media industry gave them credit for (or was able to serve), and now that these specific tastes are easily served, the general, abstracted versions of these media have lost tremendous value.<p>Hope that makes sense, /rant.",1298231721

It really seems that Google wants people to not realize they are using a web browser when they are browsing the web, and the URL bar is one of the last notable things separating typical browser UI with that of desktop applications.<p>Defaults are important because so few people change them or even notice them.  Hiding the URL bar by default will make some new Chrome users not even realize it is there, and yet more will eventually neglect to use it properly.  The web then becomes like a HyperCard stack, with Google as the top card (by default).  I'm sure this is exactly how Google wants the web to be, but it's not going to help create knowledgable web users.<p>I'm sure you've heard of users that google ""www.nytimes.com"" to go to the New York Times, because they already don't know how to use the URL bar or what a URL is and equate Google with getting anywhere on the web.

Class B states that it is legal to build (and distribute?) programs designed for wireless telephone handsets that are legally obtained in their own right (don't reuse code that say Apple developed), but again it is restricted to ""Wireless telephone handsets ... connected to a wireless ... network""<p>Using the letter of the law, PS3 jailbreaking is not covered under those exemptions. The only exemptions relating to video games are to controlled DRM works where a hacker wishes to research security vulnerabilities, but the ""information derived from the security testing is used or maintained in a manner that does not facilitate copyright infringement"". Sony might have a decent case against GeoHot based on this, since he released the keys that enable people to sign custom code that may act as a frontloader to bypass DRM checks for illegally obtained copyrighted code.<p>Us hackers might consider the differences between a PS3 and an iPhone negligible enough that hacking either is logically the same task, but the DCMA states that they are two separate beasts and hacking one is entirely different than hacking the other. Unfortunately, people need to follow the letter of the law in order to stay out of these kinds of legal challenges, but these legal challenges are also what help craft the law to be fair.

I initially wanted to write this program in Lisp so I began to look at available libraries. For the gui component, my first pick was Qt, for which Lisp actually has bindings. I spent about a week trying to get all the dependencies for it installed unsuccessfully. The documentation essentially says, ""You need all these installed,"" and then gives you a bunch of links to their respective websites. All of the other details were missing.<p>Specifically, I could not install the smoke bindings for Qt. I searched for any guides or documentation and always found a git/svn repository. Once I had the files, I had no idea what to do with them; where they needed to go or how to compile them, etc. Raw .cpp and .h files that have dependencies do nothing in isolation. Furthermore, there was no support forum or any other place to ask for help.<p>Finally, I just gave up. It was too much work to just hack together what was supposed to be a fun weekend project.

2242768,comment,2242385,2242385,0,0,Mz,,,"<i>Karma threshold required to submit ""Ask HN's""</i><p>I don't like this at all and would down vote it if that were an option.  I joined this forum so I could post an ""Ask HN"". That was the very first thing I did.  And I have seen people do throwaway accounts to ask questions anonymously who are (presumably/apparently) members in good standing but have some valid reason to not want to ask under their regular account.  I have in recent weeks been thinking that it might make some sense to let people post an Ask HN with a new account but not post other submissions until they have a certain karma threshold.  The people who submit spam are frequently brand new accounts and seem to not participate in the forum at all.  People who are new (or using a new account) and doing an Ask HN are much, much more often looking for legitimate feedback than folks who start posting other types of submissions from a new account.<p>The only hesitation I have is that in another forum I used to participate in, in place of karma, they used post-count as their measure and when they instituted a post-count threshold for getting certain privileges, people would join, make like 25 inane, pointless posts to hit the threshold and, voila, get the privilege they sought.  However, since karma works very differently from post count, it is probably far less abusable.<p>Also, please do not limit comments per day.<p>For the most part, the options listed do not appeal to me.  They are mostly a ""big stick"" approach to problems.  There is a time and a place for that but please, please do not turn HN into some version of what people are complaining goes on at International airports in the US.  Polite, civilized behavior is something which occurs by mutual agreement and is rooted in genuine respect, not fear of reprisal.  You can model that and you can foster that but you cannot beat people into genuinely respecting you/each other or being sincerely polite.<p>Edit to reply to this piece:<p><i>Super-bonus extra special bonus round: if you've been here for more than 500 days and think HN's S/N hasn't degraded over the last 6 months, tell us all why! My perception is that most veterans think it has.</i><p>Not saying it ""hasn't degraded"" but it seems to me that a lot of the folks on the leader board are older members -- by that I mean they are not 23 years old but tend more towards their 30's and 40's.  A recent poll of the age distribution of the site has caused me to stop and reassess ""tone"" of some of the comments. I'm 45.  Most folks here are a lot younger than I am.  ""Young and clueless"" sometimes sounds rude and disrespectful but often is not.  If they are just youthful and exuberant and you reply factually to their erroneous assumptions, young people are typically way more willing to step back from their initial position than older people are -- unless, of course, you reply in an ugly way, in which case it rapidly degrades.  So that has influenced my recent behavior to be a bit slower to assume someone is being an arse.  It has helped make my recent experience more positive as well.<p>I don't know if the age distribution has changed or not from ""the good old days"".  I just know that information made me look at posts in a different light.",1298230655

Apologies.<p>Yes splitting your data into a training set and a test set is a really good idea for problems like these.<p>But I'd still argue it's near impossible to generate decent grading first, TDD-style, with only a superficial knowledge of the problem you're trying to solve in that case.<p>Say you've got one obscure Star Wars character in your test set.  Top results are probably imdb and wikipidia and that looks good.  Then you've got a slightly less obscure character in the test set.  And you stick with imdb and wikipedia as the top results for testing purposes.  But he's got a huge page on wookiepedia.  He's got a huge fansite.  He's got a huge personal page.  A twitter account more popular than Austin Kutcher.  All popular enough to bump IMDB and Wikipedia out of the top five.  Now the test you wrote is broken, and you're coding to broken results.<p>In that case I don't think we're capable of generating good tests to define the result set FIRST, TDD-style.  I don't think we're capable of specifying the application behavior FIRST, BDD-style.  I think its better to play around with the data and algorithms first, until you start to get a gut feel for the data.  And then you can write some decent tests for the test data.<p>Same with mapping software.  It's probably a good idea for the shipping product to have a test suite that does something like generate 100 random or not-so-random trips, then make sure that: you can get there from here, You can do it in +/- 5% of the time/miles that we've already esablished, etc.  But I question how much value those tests have for day 1 or week one or even month one when you're writing the software.  There's a lot of legwork before those will even come close to passing.  And because you now don't have an un-broken build, people will potentially start ignoring problems with tests that should be passing week one.<p>And I know you're not saying this, but every time people argue about TDD, the TDD proponents seem to think that no-one else tests.  Which isn't true at all.  You do need tests.  The question is when and how.  And the answer isn't always before anything else.",1298229180

I've decided that generative art/music is an interesting market, and so I originally was going to make synthesizer apps for Android. After much thought, I decided that a musician centric app, (not to mention a professionally useless one) excluded too many people. So my compromise was to make a series of sound organisms, each with a distinct sound, behavior, and visual style. Similar to RJDJ(1) or Brian Eno's generative sound apps(2). I figured this would be a good idea because IMO the aforementioned apps are a bit too hard to grasp for the average user. People might sympathize more with a creature that produces sound as a byproduct than a generative sound application with abstract visuals. At least that was my reasoning.<p>So the actual project is going along nicely, but from reading HN a lot I realize that the launch and marketing are pretty important as well. I don't know anything about marketing or launching a product. I was planning on charging $.99 for each app (each creature would be an individual app), and for my website I would have a splash page with a video, some QR codes and links to the apps in the market. Besides posting to HN and Reddit, what else can I do to spread the word about my apps? Should I set up the splash page now and gather emails? I don't know if people would be that excited about something that is kind of hard to explain without watching a video, which is why I'm hesitant about trying to build excitement without a finished product.

8503410,comment,8502968,8503164,0,0,Terretta,,,"> <i>history of being quite hostile to consumers</i><p>That&#x27;s going to need some really impressive fact-based justification.<p>I think a good case could be made Apple&#x27;s the only PC maker focused on making mass market consumers happy (vs enterprise or technology buyers).<p>They&#x27;ve also seemed more focused on the product experience than on market share.<p>- - -<p>Some TL;DR specific thoughts on each of your examples:<p>- <i>&quot;finally offering larger screens for the iPhones&quot;</i> -- the giant screen move feels anti-Samsung, not pro-consumer.  There is an ideal <i>one handed</i> screen size, and the 6/6+ are not it.  The 5 series was already pushing it.  The problem for Apple is in the big box or mobile store, bigger looks better.  In every day use, once the phone is part of you, one handed becomes natural when right sized.  (If you&#x27;ve only used bigger, you don&#x27;t know any better.)  In the store handling with two hands, you don&#x27;t realize it won&#x27;t go well.  Buying experience and <i>using</i> experiences are at odds here, though I grant the bigger screens are nice when you are <i>not mobile</i>.<p>- <i>&quot;finally making iTunes (partially) DRM free&quot;</i> -- it&#x27;s well documented that movie, TV, and record industry execs were the problem here, not tech providers, and Apple&#x27;s fight to liberate music was quite public.<p>- <i>cross compatibility</i> -- this is a bugaboo (something that causes fear or distress out of proportion to its importance).  with rapidly evolving technologies, it&#x27;s extraordinarily difficult to have an end to end ecosystem &#x27;just work&#x27; for normals not interested in diagnosing why it fails.  Apple controls that end to end to make sure it works.  Even then, things happen, like the Airport Extremes and iOS 8 WiFi, but because they control both, they can release updates to both to fix it.  They don&#x27;t have to support the lowest common denominator, they can push for performance and stability both.  The bargain a user makes with Apple is &quot;buy into the ecosystem, get peace of mind and eliminate the need for a tech guru.&quot;",1414155531

The fit is so perfect I actually suspect he... ah... played with his data slightly after the fact. A &quot;fortuitous&quot; choice for alpha is obviously helpful too.&quot;<p>Author of the linked blog post here.  I made the comment that &quot;if I had instead chosen 12, or 13 (for alpha), the resulting predictions would not agree nearly as well.&quot;  This is perhaps overstating the &quot;luck&quot; of my initial midpoint choice.  Here is a quick plot showing the same data with predictions using 12, 12.5, and 13:\n<a href=""http://imgur.com/lP5sjwB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/lP5sjwB</a><p>(Note also that a better least-squares estimate of alpha is actually about 12.7.)  Even these &quot;endpoints&quot; still look to be in reasonable agreement with measurements.  That is, if 12 to 13 calories per pound really represents most of the range of variability among the (male) population, then one can likely make useful predictions without needing to be spot-on with their choice of alpha.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s a valid question whether 12 to 13 really covers a large chunk of the distribution.  Are there men out there with alpha<10, or >15, for example?",1414155239

Where is this added complexity?<p>Recently, I tried to install a few ocaml projects. I had to learn what are Opam, OCamlfind, Batteries, Core... And unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work on my particular mac with homebrew. I had to use alternative ways of installing everything.<p>If you look at the installation procedure:\n<a href=""https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html</a>\nIt may be rather complex depending on the platform, and if it doesn&#x27;t work from the start, you have to dig deeply in this whole new ecosystem.<p>An other example. I was trying to install a project that compiles only using ocamlfind. Unfortunately, one of the libraries used wasn&#x27;t available with Opam and I had to find it elsewhere and write myself the ocamlfind meta information.<p>So yes, to me, a lot of complexity was added. There are many new tools that you have to learn, a few standard libraries (I still don&#x27;t know which one to use as a casual developer).<p>It&#x27;s probably much powerful and it works well most of the time, but it&#x27;s more complex than 10 years ago.",1414155125

Say a customer chooses a vendor that sells his information after he ends his service with them.

It&#x27;s easier (I would argue/guess) to understand a sentence talking about what <i>the captain of the Danube steamship company</i> did than a sentence about what <i>the Danube steamship company captain</i> did. Both utterances are noun phrases and have practically the same meaning.<p>It&#x27;s still possible that German and English speakers differ in the way they use compound nouns -- e.g. how often they use compounds instead of paraphrasing them or how spontaneously they form new, unfamiliar compounds.",1414153974

The current OS market is stale.<p>The POSIX era is closing, it fails to properly model non-serial or disk based data operations. Flowing data like tcp/ip connections are horribly handled in the Unix like model. Linux is a bloated monster with thousands of system calls, and the BSD&#x27;s are stable but user/developer hostile (MacOSX included at a systems level Darwin has a lot of memory management brain damage).<p>The problem largely with drivers is a war you can&#x27;t win.<p>Windows has backwards compatibility written into it at a very fundamental level. This was a good lesson Windows learned from IBM early on. If you write something for windows 95, it&#x27;ll likely work with windows8. System32 is still System32. Most your API&#x27;s, IPC, Draw calls, etc. All still exist, most are actually faster.<p>The biggest selling point of an IBM mainframe isn&#x27;t that they are fast. It isn&#x27;t they have 400+ PPC chips, each with 24 virtual processors. Its that they are binary compatible with IBM System360. If you invested 10 man years writing an application in the 1970&#x27;s, it still runs today, without the need to write or fix things. It just works. You can have faith in IBM and those guys with gold medallions and bellbottoms who are now balding managers.<p>Does it fully make economic sense? No. The cost of IBM equipment, support, etc. Is likely way more then 10 man years of software time over 40 year history that application has been deployed.<p>The fundamental problem is purchaser ignorance. The purchaser may see there are more competitive solutions. But the chain of command doesn&#x27;t want to invest, it wants to be comfortable. You aren&#x27;t fighting silicon valley investors so much as you are fighting wall street.<p>Compare this to say Uber. Which solved a fundamental problem. Hailing taxi&#x27;s is stupid. Lets make it easier. Ask for a taxi on your app and wait. The quality of your life has improved. The balance sheet looks the same (largely) a taxi costs X dollars.

Data center costs stay the same, software development costs go up. How does that balance sheet look?<p>I&#x27;ll give you a hint. Bad. There is no market, or demand for it. At best it&#x27;ll end up being another marginalized fringe OS.<p>P.S.: If you want to do start with Plan9 work up from there, make the kernel interface work like 3.x linux kernal so you can use linux code.

The cheapest option, and best option for everyone really, is to continue using (an up-to-date) Mono and instead allow for writing games in C++ as well.<p>Yes. It seems logical that there have been some licensing negotiations that we&#x27;re not aware of, and maybe all this is part of ongoing negotiations too.<p>What&#x27;s puzzling is that they&#x27;re keeping il2cpp closed.

However, they do require images to be taken of you, that are entered into a database ( <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/state-photo-id-databases-become-troves-for-police/2013/06/16/6f014bd4-ced5-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/state-phot...</a> ). So when discussing &#x27;biometrics&#x27; as a whole, government agencies routinely collect and share it.<p>Plus, let&#x27;s not forget the data sharing arrangements that were highlighted by Greenwald; the US collects fingerprints from anyone entering the country ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Biometric_Identity_Management"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Biometric_Identity_Ma...</a> ), and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re happy to share that information with other countries, who may be prevented legally from collecting that info from their own citizens. And vice versa. So traveled overseas? It&#x27;s not unreasonable to assume your home country now has access to that piece of biometric data. Certainly, the country you traveled to does.<p>And of course, if you are arrested, your fingerprints are entered into a DB as well (though you can fight to have them removed if you are never found guilty of anything; good luck with that).<p>In general, our biometric data is collected routinely, and so makes a really bad choice for a password.

8503204,comment,8497670,8501323,0,0,smoyer,,,"I spent my morning bus-ride wondering about this and my conclusion is that there&#x27;s not much to say ... I wouldn&#x27;t want that job and I doubt that anyone else would either.  The question of why we feel guilt and/or whether we should is a bit ambiguous:<p>1)  If I&#x27;m viewing moderated content, how do I even know that?  And should I feel guilty for only being shown that which meets certain guidelines?  I&#x27;d say no.  If I&#x27;m disturbed by something I see on the Internet, should I assume it&#x27;s unmoderated content and/or somebody didn&#x27;t do their job?  I don&#x27;t.<p>2)  If I&#x27;m running a business and feel the need to provide moderators, should I feel guilty that they&#x27;re exposed to the content that&#x27;s deemed unfit?  Assuming I&#x27;m paying them what a wage that&#x27;s mutually acceptable, I don&#x27;t think so.  If the wage wasn&#x27;t acceptable given the job, people would simply work elsewhere.  If I&#x27;m seeing high turn-over, that might indicate these employees decide the job isn&#x27;t worth the psychological trauma only after they&#x27;ve spent time working.  Should I help these workers maintain their sanity (through training, counselling, etc as well as designing the systems to minimize the content&#x27;s impact)?  Absolutely!  Should I pay them more than the market rate?  That doesn&#x27;t really fix any mental issues the job is causing, it just locks employees into a role they can&#x27;t take longer.<p>3)  If I&#x27;m posting content that needs to be moderated, should I feel guilty that someone has to moderate the garbage I&#x27;m spewing?  Nope ... I&#x27;m the five percent or so of the population that rarely considers the consequence of my on-line actions!  In fact, I find it funny to cause other humans discomfort (excuse me while I go DOX the latest underage rape victim).<p>So the problem is that those who are guilty will never be stopped, and can&#x27;t easily be blamed.  Those in the middle have decided to apply quality standards (which might mean moderation) and are probably clinging to razor-thin profits (if they&#x27;re not just burning VC money) and it&#x27;s simply a business decision - do I make more with moderation or without.  And those of us viewing any given web page don&#x27;t know whether or not moderation has happened.<p>I think it&#x27;s a lousy answer but my opinion is that there are a lot of jobs in this category - jobs that people don&#x27;t really want to do.  Does anyone really want to be a garbage-man?  If you watch &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot; with Mike Rowe, I think you find quite a few that aren&#x27;t desirable but are made viable by the market.<p>Sorry for the long non-answer!",1414152023

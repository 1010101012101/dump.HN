When I was at $LARGE_VIDEO_GAME_COMPANY, a ""code review"" was a pre-checkin (to Perforce) meeting with the nearest cubemate, at your computer, showing them diffs. It was designed to be as short as possible, but had a good bang-for-the-buck since simple little things could be caught very quickly by another person doing a sanity check.<p>In contrast, ""code review"" at my next full-time job inspired dread of 3-hour all-hands meetings where a big group would go over code, line by line, ages after it was submitted to the repo.<p>I'm solidly behind the former process. I've come up with a checklist of ""pre-commit"" tasks to do before someone checks in code to one of my project repos, which generally ensures that any changes submitted are tested, and as minimal as possible.",1309992785

Not all of our clients/employers are huge entities with business processes and data requirements that are stable for decades. Many, if not most of the projects that come across the desk of an IT developer are temporary projects with indefinite scope.<p>One of my current projects is modelling a rather complex set of intertwined business processes. Part of the problem is just getting the client to explain their existing processes completely. Another part of the problem is that the processes are always changing. As soon as I think I finally have all the data models figured out, there's one more tweak. I am not great at data modelling or SQL, but tweaking a dozen 50 line joins on a daily basis is not happy fun time for anyone. At some point the specced data model, the model as implemented, and the conceptual model that's in my head get out of sync in some mysterious way, the plot is lost and it all turns to shit. On top of this I'm also trying to manage an object model that sorta maybe corresponds to the data model. In cases where the spec changes frequently, the higher cognitive load of maintaining a decent relational model is simply not worth it.",1309992763

I recall Olympus stating that phones were simply incapable of competing with digital cameras, regardless of market. However the market has shown that phones eat into the low end market and the SLRs are pushing down from the top putting a lot of pressure on the mid-range market.<p>I could imagine that the 'phone' function as an adjunct to all tablets. All you need is a headset and voice dialing and your tablet can go VOIP/Cellular as the channel availability demands. Services like Gvoice making the endpoints number vanish by overlaying it with a 'logical' phone number.<p>Its not a huge step to cannibalization of the smartphone market by the tablet market.",1309992413

This can be deduced from the ASP that Apple, HTC, RIM etc report. iPhone ASP has always been $600+, while HTC, RIM have ASPs around $300-400 (Samsung smartphone ASP is even lower). This can also be seen by looking at contract prices outside the US. For example, in the UK all phones can be had free on contract, but the monthly amount you pay for an iPhone is much larger than for a top of the line Android (see the O2 or Vodafone UK sites).<p>The reason this is not reflected in the contract-less prices is because US carriers have a very strong incentive to inflate them to force you to choose contracts.",1309991662

For me, that meant finding & making friends with people in a similar situation as mine, going out for coffee, lunch or dinner with them every so often (~2-6 times a week), and using them for support when the roller coaster was dipping fast.<p>Of course, finding such a support system is easier said than done. I was fortunate that many of my former coworkers were in similar situations, so I just reached out to them. I haven't had as much luck in meetups and conferences, but perhaps you may. Friends of friends were sometimes a good source too - whenever I heard that such a 2nd degree connection was also an entrepreneur, I'd invite them out for a casual coffee and make sure they knew I wasn't out to get anything from them, apart from meeting fellow entrepreneurs and perhaps finding a sounding board. A few worked out, most didn't though.<p>I should add that I personally find great comfort in being able to help others too. So in reaching out to these people, I sometimes found myself helping them as much as I was being helped - and that reciprocal relationship was what really made it work, IMO.<p>Another idea: See if you can rebalance your life to include more of your family and friends again. I know that's not always easy in a startup with insane deadlines, but you can start small. Put aside one day a week for family & friends. Or even one meal a week.

My startup is making progress, secured some funding. Won a few prizes. The code is coming along nicely.<p>But my private life is an utter disaster. I'm in debt. I'm neglecting my family. I'm alienated from my friends. Besides my startup I'm doing none of the things I want to do.<p>What helped <i>you</i> get through moments like this?",1309989686

But it makes sense that this would be a part of the problem, since the blog has the freshest content, and the bad result does come from the blog.<p>However, this still doesn't explain why jquery.it has such a high pagerank. And blog.jquery.it has a pagerank of only 1. I can't find any interesting-looking links to jquery.it that would explain the high rank. It's also strange that Google returns blog.jquery.it 1st for the search ""jquery 1.6.2"", since those strings are found at lots of highly ranked blogs (pagerank>1 for sure). We could be dealing, once again, with Google's preference for finding search terms in the domain name. But this puzzle is still not coming together for me. This is why I'd like wiser persons than me to try to get to the bottom of this.",1309989653

It's also got a much better language (C#). It was definitely a good choice when scala was still young. Nowadays... pretty much depends on what you're used to.",1309989638

And it&#x27;s kind of jarring to see them in contrast, to say, the production values on the early seasons of DS9, a contemporaneous series. The latter probably had a much bigger production budget, and I guess it shows. But I&#x27;ll forgive a show its low-budget feel if it makes up for that in other ways. Try as I might, I just couldn&#x27;t summon the attention span to last past the first few episodes. They were about as exciting as reading a particularly dry textbook on political economy.<p>I&#x27;ll grant you that every sci-fi show seems to have its bad episodes, and many of them occur early on. DS9 was not immune to that effect.<p>At some point I pledge to give B5 a more serious attempt.

One side of it is what you&#x27;re expounding upon (the mgmt / engineering dichotomy)...which I agree with largely (although I think there&#x27;s also room in some companies to be largely tech and advance up the ranks while saying no to those other responsibilities).<p>What I was getting at was the second aspect of it which was the &quot;out of bounds time&quot; alluded to when OP said &quot;The problem is I don’t enjoy meeting with executives at 8pm over drinks to try to discuss the next big deal. I don’t like to make presentations late into the night to put in front of Venture Capital, Series A/B investors, or Executives.&quot;  I was focusing on the &quot;8pm&quot; and &quot;late into the night&quot; parts of the phrase which is more lifestyle / time overreach than the other aspect.<p>OTOH, I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to get stock which came out to be worth quite a bit (granted it took quite a bit of effort to make that so).  I&#x27;ve also had the stock which was worth very little in comparison to the effort.  It&#x27;s often a difficult thing to weigh as one is weighing effort, the market, and a lot of external things.<p>As a &quot;doer&quot;, we are frequently not paid what I think we should be.  To get paid that I think requires often taking on a lot more responsibilities that some of us don&#x27;t often want to handle (sales, marketing, hr, legal, etc. ... ie running a company).",1405979900
8066251,comment,8064786,8065913,2,0,andrewla,,,"While regulation will always play a role in this, I would hesitate to say that this is &quot;the&quot; difficulty.  Transferring dollars (say) electronically is complicated because you need to prove that no dollars are being created or destroyed.  Though you could phrase this as a regulatory rule, it&#x27;s really more of an accounting requirement.<p>The system as it stands (FedWire/CHIPS/SWIFT, and ACH on a consumer level) is very complex and tries to strike a balance between reasonable clearing times and limiting trust of individual actors.<p>The difficulties in an electronic money transfer system for fiat currency are, in my option, primarily technical and logistic, with the logistic aspect being maintaining the correspondence between specie and electronic balances.<p>That said, it&#x27;s always hard to analyze success.  Arguably, bitcoin does not solve the money transfer problem any better than previous schemes, like Chaum blind signatures or egold.

Even in the badly broken implementation we have today, there are things BIT.LY can do to override Libya; for instance, they can have their certificate pinned to a specific trusted CA.<p>The general belief that TLD managers &quot;already&quot; control sites is probably behind a lot of otherwise- inexplicable DNSSEC boosterism. Because if you really believe that, then sure, giving <i>still more</i> control to the operators of those TLDs is just a cosmetic change.<p>But, thankfully: no. No, no, no. The operators of .COM don&#x27;t get to monitor Google mail. The government of the British Indian Ocean Territories doesn&#x27;t get to patch Redis.<p>The schemes we have now to fence Internet trust off from TLDs are imperfect. The right response to that is to make them better. DNSSEC advocates act like this is a pipe dream, but there are surprisingly simple things we can do right now to massively improve the situation, like adopting TACK or HPKP to turn everyone&#x27;s (or at least everyone running Chrome and Firefox&#x27;s) browsers into a surveillance system for attempts to compromise Internet trust.<p>&quot;But we can do this in a DNSSEC world, too&quot;, the DNSSEC advocates say. That&#x27;s not quite right; they mean to say, &quot;but we still have to do this in a DNSSEC world&quot;. Two problems. First, if we&#x27;re going to rely on HPKP/TACK and CT as a bridge to a decentralized reasonable trust system, why waste the time and effort on DNSSEC in the first place? Answer: there is no compelling reason to do that. Secondly: DNSSEC <i>actually makes it harder to do those things</i>; among the reasons, when TLD operators misbehave, there is <i>no recourse at all</i> for rectifying the situation. How long do you think it takes the Chrome team to flip the switch to remove a rogue CA? Now, how long will it take them to remove .COM?",1405977472

The analytics will give you great insights into user behaviour, retention, churn rate, segmentation, etc. Use the data to decide what you should focus on next (e.g. if the user engagement is too low, try focusing on that).<p>ASO\n- Optimize keywords to ensure that you are ranking in the top 10 for each of your keywords. I have written a series of blog posts about this topic (<a href=""http://blackboardmadness.com/blog/app-store-optimization-aso-selecting-the-right-keywords-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blackboardmadness.com/blog/app-store-optimization-aso...</a>) and also developed my own keyword selection/scoring model.

Cities should not be in the telecommunications business. However, there SHOULD be laws promoting competition and thus restricting the de facto monopoly positions of many providers. Where I live in France, I have, in just my small town of Avignon, at least 5 high speed internet providers available -- resulting in my monthly cost for 120mbs + full cable (all the movie channels) cell phone with unlimited data, unlimited calls to over 49 countries in the world AND home phone (which I never use) for about 70 euro per month. The internet portion of that is something like 20 euro per month, the cell portion is about 15 or so (give or take 3 euro.)<p>Cities don&#x27;t need to get in the telecoms business -- however governments do have a responsibility to promote competition. Cities getting into the internet business would be about as efficient as the Post Office getting into the letter delivery business -- a ton of public-union-related waste, bureaucratic inefficiencies as well as an inherit incentive to discourage private companies, thus reducing innovation. You also have the issue of city-run networks being subject to political pressures such as &quot;I&#x27;ll donate money to your reelection if you allow my content to have preference on the network.&quot; You also have the city having access to your usage records and they&#x27;d be nothing keeping them from using it for law enforcement purposes without a warrant or your consent. After all, you&#x27;d be using city-owned property, thus you really wouldn&#x27;t have much leverage. The police would certainly leverage that. We all know that most internet traffic isn&#x27;t going to be safe from NSA-types, however, there&#x27;s a reasonable belief that NSA-level intercepts aren&#x27;t filtering down to the local cop on the beat. Maybe it&#x27;s a bit of paranoia, however based on my experiences with city governments in the US, they are some of the most power-hungry, corrupt sufferers of little-man(woman) syndrome I&#x27;ve ever encountered. These are the same twits that want to ban large sodas because they think they&#x27;re your daddies and mommies. Yeah, count me out.

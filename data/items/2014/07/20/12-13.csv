8060142,comment,8059539,8059810,1,0,crdoconnor,,,">Capitalism&#x27;s periodic financial crises have been a way to solve perhaps fundamental imbalances.<p>In theory (if you just leave the crisis to play out) that&#x27;s what should happen, but in practice it rarely does. Not without the correct political response.<p>The too-big-to-fails in the US could have been allowed to go bankrupt, but it would have caused a catastrophic economic bottleneck because they have so many counterparties. Following regular insolvency procedures for a small enterprise is complicated enough and can take years as the creditors fight it out among themselves over how to divvy up the remainders of liquidation. Imagine how much of a clusterfuck it would be if half the country was either a creditor or a debtor in some respect. Worse, you wouldn&#x27;t know if half of the rest of the country was bankrupt or not until you resolved the clusterfuck.<p>What could have happened was for a temporary nationalization so that the banks could have continued operating in a limited form so as to avoid the bottleneck and give time to tie up the loose ends. This is what Sweden did in the 90s. Their fundamental balance was resolved and they returned swiftly to growth.<p>When the too-big-to-fails are too politically powerful, however, they just tell the government to make them solvent again and the government promptly does it. Spectacularly bad lending decisions then resume and the power of the heads of those banks increases even more as the cancerous organization grows even larger. The fundamental imbalance has worsened.",1405858609

Some people, like Gilbert Levin, are more confident about the data than others.<p>Even further back in time, Percival Lowell believed there were canals on Mars. The discovery of life now would be so much less shocking than the impact of Lowell&#x27;s work, no? If only because we know that any such life can&#x27;t attack us a la Wells.<p>Also, wouldn&#x27;t &quot;shock&quot; more likely lead to new funding for Mars missions? What reason is there to delay and minimize that announcement?<p>No, I think a better hypothesis is that the information we have about Mars is growing over time (&quot;piling up&quot;), which allows us to make more and more definite conclusions. Since the observed events are compatible with that simpler hypothesis, I see no need to add a new wrinkle to the system.",1405858372

8060135,comment,8060030,8060030,23,0,pdabbadabba,,,"Here&#x27;s a better headline: &quot;My Uber gor pulled over by the Denver Police, and the officer mistakenly told us Uber is illegal.&quot; Maybe not so many clicks that way, though.<p>I agree that this was a rather unfortunate and odd experience, but I don&#x27;t see what the big deal is. The only thing that struck me as &quot;really weird&quot; about this is that the author called a Denver Post reporter to get live legal information while he was in the car, and that the author wrote this sentence: &quot;Did I really want to take a ride from an individual who clearly lied to me, then was evasive when I asked one basic question?&quot;  (Did it ever occur to the author that the cop might just have been mistaken about Uber&#x27;s legality? Did it occur to him the the officer was just trying to do him a favor?)<p>At the end of the day, we have a cop who pulled an Uber driver over for speeding and, though he mistakenly thought Uber was illegal, nonetheless only issued a speeding ticket and offered to drive the passenger to the airport. The author goes out of his way to pain the officer as behaving &quot;really weirdly,&quot; and I suppose I don&#x27;t see why the officer needed the passenger&#x27;s ID (though I also would not be surprised to learn that it is totally normal for an officer to request a passenger&#x27;s ID), but for the most part this seems like everyone did their jobs properly.<p>Of course, in a perfect world, an officer would know everything about Colorado law. But that is clearly unrealistic. So while yes, of course, it would be preferable for an officer to be properly informed about Uber&#x27;s legality, I don&#x27;t think we should be judging him too harshly for his mistake, especially when it sounds like Colorado has only recently legalized Uber, and the officer did not attempt to ticket or detain anyone for the purported violation.<p>Edit: By the way, the Colorado law imposes a number of requirements. Companies must obtain permits, drivers must display various notices and &quot;[t]o obtain permits, the companies must have drivers pass criminal-background and driving-history checks. The drivers&#x27; cars must pass vehicle inspections, and be clearly marked as [&#x27;transportation network company&#x27;] cars. The drivers must also carry personal car insurance, in addition to the commercial insurance Uber and Lyft provide.&quot; <a href=""http://gazette.com/uber-lyft-become-regulated-in-colorado/article/1521068"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gazette.com/uber-lyft-become-regulated-in-colorado/ar...</a> Nothing in the article on whether Uber, or his Uber driver, has complied.

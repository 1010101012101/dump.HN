Congratulations Sony.<p>Companies like Halfbrick, Rovio, Firemint, Pixelbite and many many more were made by an open market on mobile. I am excited to see what games will pop up on PS4. They already had better indie exclusives like Joe Danger, Fat Princess and more. Good times ahead for gaming on the PS4.<p>What I don&#x27;t get is being open appstores attracts developers and sells more hardware and subsequently more games. Why would Microsoft shut that down?

I suspect that the reputation of Aliens: Colonial Marines is so bad that price reductions aren&#x27;t helping.<p>I suspect that publishers would love to be able to kill used games and maintain current pricing strategies, but I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll work for them.  Video game sales are too price elastic and, like you said, for people who would ordinarily buy new at $60 and resell at $30, their video gaming budget would only buy half the games it used to.  These people would be more likely to wait until the games were $30.<p>In a worst-case scenario, if publishers persisted with that strategy, other forms of entertainment may be seen as more appealing and money might disappear from the video games industry.<p>Like you&#x27;ve said, the free market would take care of it, and I think used games are standing in the way of that being able to happen while allowing maximum compensation for the developers.",1370930160

5860003,comment,5859307,5859307,23,0,leoc,,,"From the point of view of any non-resident alien who has US cloud data, this is a <i>very</i> ponderable answer. We know what the Fourth Amendment says. The problem is that apparently (IANAL!) the US courts are upholding the idea that <i>the Fourth Amendment does not apply to the US-based cloud data of non-US-resident non-US-citizens</i>. I&#x27;ve heard a couple of people suggesting that this interpretation is based on the idea of border search, but that&#x27;s neither here nor there: the upshot is that, unlike for example the US property of non-US-resident non-US-citizens, which is protected by the Takings Clause, the US cloud data of non-resident aliens seems to have no Constitutional protection. This seems to be the Constitutional foundation of FISA <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-92/pdf/STATUTE-92-Pg1783.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-92/pdf/STATUTE-92-Pg178...</a> 702 <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr6304/text"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr6304/text</a> , the law which allows the NSA to get Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Orders against non-resident aliens. <i>Absolutely the only thing</i> the government has to prove to the FISC court to get one of these orders is that the targets are (more likely than not!) non-resident aliens. No probable cause, no standard of suspicion for anything: the government doesn&#x27;t even have to state its motivation. And the &quot;Notwithstanding any other provision of law&quot; language in 702 seems to sweep away any other statute law you (or Rackspace etc.) might want to use against the order. (Again IANAL.)<p>So how are we to interpret<p>&quot;Based on our interpretation of the Fourth Amendment and ECPA, we are of the view that Rackspace is prohibited from accessing and turning over customer data stored on a customer’s server or other storage device in a U.S. data center without a properly issued, lawful request ( e.g. search warrants, court orders, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Orders) from a U.S. court with appropriate jurisdiction over Rackspace and the data sought.&quot;<p>? Coming right after the recitation of the Fourth Amendment, this gives the impression that Rackspace will only hand out your data in response to a warrant (or warrant-like-thing) that demonstrates probable cause. But in fact, when the customer is a non-resident alien, the order is a FISA 702 order, and the court is the FISC, probable cause never comes into it: the US can (completely properly and lawfully!) get such an order for no stated reason at all. Imagine the following conversation in 1860:<p>Q: I hear that you have slaves on your Virginia cotton plantation. Is this really true?<p>A: The Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution states that &#x27;No person shall [...] be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law&#x27;. No-one is forcibly detained on this plantation except fully in accordance with the law and the Fifth Amendment.<p>This answer seeks to suggest that the only prisoners on the plantation are convicted criminals, which is false - the plantation is worked by slaves. But in fact the answer is precisely true though devious: slaves have no rights under the law, while the Fifth Amendment does not apply to slaves. I really hope this isn&#x27;t the correct way to interpret Rackspace&#x27;s statement as well.",1370930125

5859997,comment,5859307,5859731,8,0,lightknight,,,"Maybe you would, maybe you wouldn&#x27;t.<p>See, that&#x27;s part of the problem in terms of economic calculation when dealing with a surveillance society -> since it&#x27;s largely impossible to quantify the amount of lost business due to various surveillance / justice actions, as the methods and individual events in which such actions took place may never see the light of day, a society could be going bankrupt due to an overly large security division, and never know it.<p>Let&#x27;s consider a real-life plausible scenario: a DEA agent gets a tip from a questionable source about a large shipment of Molly coming in tonight on the docks (cliche, but let&#x27;s roll with it). The information isn&#x27;t good enough to get a warrant, but the DEA hasn&#x27;t had a bust in a while, and the agents are being pressured to find something to justify their jobs. This DEA agent figures that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to have a look around (nothing illegal there, right?), and spotting nothing immediately out on the docks, begins to think that it&#x27;s a bust. The agent notices that an upper window is open on one of the warehouses, and that there are voices being heard within; it would take a little effort, shimmying up the side, but the agent could peak through the window (questionable)...and maybe even climb inside if the agent sees something. The agent climbs up, and hears rising voices from within. Not seeing anyone, the agent climbs in.<p>The agent, walking on top of some crates, sees the owners of the voices, and after listening for several moments, realizes that it&#x27;s just a typical worker&#x27;s spat. The agent goes to leave, not seeing anything of interest...but as the agent moves, one of the crates topples, pushing the one in front of it, and so on in a domino fashion. The agent manages to leave undiscovered, but not before $30 million in Lowe&#x27;s Italian Chandeliers are dropped three stories onto a hard concrete floor.<p>The workers will be blamed for not stacking the crates correctly, and the owner of the warehouse cited. The insurance company will, of course, cover the costs of the damaged merchandise. However, the cost to society, for this overstep, was more than a minor civil rights violation...it was more than those workers make in a decade, possibly their lives.<p>And that&#x27;s kind of at the heart of these infringements...when the intelligence agencies screw up, when the police screw up, it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re shouldered with that debt; it&#x27;s charged to society as the cost of doing business...no different from what the bankers did recently when they &#x27;privatized the gains, and socialized the losses.&#x27;",1370930059

The most basic role of government is to protect its own citizens against <i>that</i>, and it is not an abstract threat.

However, there is zero evidence that any of the data being collected had even been used in any way that impacted or threatened the freedom of people in the US -- it&#x27;s all possibilities and abstract paranoia.

The combination of the two is actually not a bad thing.  &quot;I know you can destroy me if I attack you, and I know you can see me if I start to do so&quot; is not a bad set of factors.  Unfortunately things like anti-satellite missiles and weapons in space really endanger that because if a small piece of space junk collides with a satellite over the other guy&#x27;s territory, you may not know <i>for sure</i> that this is not the prelude to an attack.<p>So the actual MAD strategies as they developed through the Ford years were actually quite sophisticated and stabilizing.

Then review recent elections with the definition of populism in mind. There are stark similarities.<p>&quot;When Hitler was appointed in January 1933, Germany was a democracy. Germany had fair elections; nobody had their right to vote abused; there were numerous political parties you could vote for etc. To pass a law, the Reichstag had to agree to it after a bill went through the normal processes of discussion, arguments etc. Within the Reichstag of January 1933, over 50% of those who held seats  were against the Nazi Party. Therefore it would have been very unlikely for Hitler to have got passed into law what he wanted. Many saw Hitler as a fall-guy politician who would have to shoulder to blame if things got worse under his leadership.<p>Hitler had promised a general election for March 1933. This would have been, in his mind, the perfect opportunity for him to show all politicians  who opposed him where the true loyalties lay in the German people. In fact, 1932 had shown Hitler that there was a possibility that support for the Nazis had peaked as their showing in the November 1932 election had shown. Anything other than a huge endorsement of Hitler and the Nazi Party would have been a disaster and a gamble which it is possible that Hitler did not want to take.<p>One week before the election was due to take place, the Reichstag building burned down. Hitler immediately declared that it was the signal for a communist takeover of the nation. Hitler knew that if he was to convince President Hindenburg to give him emergency powers - as stated in the Weimar Constitution - he had to play on the old president&#x27;s fear of communism.

Sony did every damned thing in their power to stop it. To run homebrew, you had to either run an older version of firmware or root the device. Every time an exploit was patched, a new one was found. This inevitably meant a lot of people spent a lot of time rooting the PSP[1]. I was impressed with how the security of the device fell time and time again to the community.<p>If Sony just allowed the PSP to run homebrew games, they&#x27;d not be in such a mess. Many of the developers rooting the devices just wanted to run their own software, but the shadow community would use that result to pirate games. Separating the two communities by allowing homebrew software on their device would have made sense for their own protection.<p>This was then followed up by the PS3. After releasing with both the ability to run Linux, they removed both. You paid for a device with X, then they removed X. Understandably the community became somewhat irate. Eventually their private signing key for their entire console was leaked due to the desire to allow homebrew and to restore OtherOS (Linux) support[2]. Sony&#x27;s legal department tried to fix that...<p>So, from all this past history, I wouldn&#x27;t trust Sony&#x27;s new direction.

I also think it&#x27;s very telling that Solaris, Linux, and Windows opted to never do this as well.<p>And now that OS X no longer offers a 32-bit kernel, this all seems moot anyway.",1370927914

Maryland said that installing a pen register to to record call detail information regarding an individual under surveillance did not need a warrant because:<p>1. The information was willingly shared with a third party.<p>2. The individual relied on the sharing for many other services including being able to trace harassing phone calls, and the like, and<p>3.  The information was not deeply revealing.<p>The much more important case regarding 3rd Party Doctrine is California Bankers Association v. Shultz (1974), which established that there is no reasonable expectation to privacy in routine surveillance of bank records of transactions above a certain amount (set at $10k under the statute then as now).  The thing is that the dissent was worried specifically about dragnet surveillance and the majority more or less swept that one under the rug.<p>However, this is not the 1970&#x27;s any more and there are reasons to think the dragnet surveillance concerns that were ignored in 1974 carry more weight today.  In 1983, the Supreme Court, in United States v. Knotts included clear dicta differentiating the case of following a car with a beeper installed in something that was sold with suspicion that it would be used illegally, from the dragnet surveillance case.  Rhenquist, writing for the majority, said:<p><pre><code>    But the fact is that the &quot;reality hardly suggests \n    abuse,&quot; Zurcher v. Stanford [460 U.S. 276, 284] Daily, \n    436 U.S. 547, 566 (1978); if such dragnet-type law \n    enforcement practices as respondent envisions should \n    eventually occur, there will be time enough then to \n    determine whether different constitutional principles \n    may be applicable.\n</code></pre>\nThe court further narrowed beeper tracking in Karo v. United States to hold it was a search when law enforcement officers determined that a barrel of ether (suspected of being used in making of narcotics) was traced to someone&#x27;s home.   Given that even without GPS, our cell phones are effectively beepers have lead some courts to start pushing back on subpoenas for historical cell site location data.<p>More recently, you have the 5 concurring justices in Antoine Jones v. United States, opining that long-term surveillance by virtue of time and amount of data collected may well violate the 4th Amendment even if individual pieces may not.  I say &quot;opining&quot; rather than &quot;ruling&quot; because Sotomayor refused to rule on that ground, but instead chose Scalia&#x27;s more narrow rule, while at the same time endorsing Alito&#x27;s much broader rule.  While not the &quot;Opinion of the Court&quot; it is still &quot;an opinion of the majority of the court&quot; and I think this has a certain amount of force on courts below.<p>We must be confronted that we are at a point where Rhenquist&#x27;s insistence that dragnet surveillance must be considered separately now mandates that we confront that.  A clear majority on the Supreme Court seems to believe that this can violate the Constitution with the other four justices merely having declined to comment on it.<p>I hope this clarifies both what the court said and what confusions there currently are as this area develops.  No I am not a lawyer but I read Supreme Court cases for fun.",1370927482

I think that a game&#x27;s value as an experience rather than &quot;an object&quot;, though, is orthogonal to it&#x27;s actual dollars-and-cents <i>value</i>. The value is the price people are willing to pay, plain and simple.<p>That is, a brand new, $60 game isn&#x27;t really worth $60 to most people after it&#x27;s been out for a couple of months. The used games market is more agile in recognizing this. If the first-party publishers became more agile, they&#x27;d wipe out the used games market. Why would I pay, say, $30 for a used, six month-old game, when I can get a brand new copy for the same price? The answer: I can&#x27;t. The first-party publishers are still charging at least $40 or $50 for that game. The used games shop has recognized that the true value of that game, six months in, is actually $30. The publisher is in denial, or trying to take advantage of some sort of arbitrage by charging $40 or $50.<p>I think you&#x27;re also discounting the fact that the first-party publishers <i>do</i> get a portion of that used games sale. That is, when someone buys a brand-new game at $60, and sells it to the used game shop for $30 a month later -- $30 of the original $60 purchase is coming from the used sale. Sure, in some cases the person buying that used copy for $35 or $40 might have bought a brand new copy if no used copies were available, but in many cases, that person might never have bought a copy at all. If the used market is shut down, maybe I stop buying the games when they&#x27;re $60, because I know I can&#x27;t get some portion of that money back to spend towards other games.<p>Anyway, as I noted in another comment, the price of a new car has not only the cost of materials and labor factored in, but also the cost of the probability that someone who buys that car used would have bought a new one instead, had the used car not been available. Video games should also be priced like this (I suspect they are, actually, and all the handwringing by the games industry is really just a misdirection).<p>TL;DR: In a free market, it doesn&#x27;t matter if a good is experience-based of utility-based, its&#x27; price should reflect its actual value (which is determined by the market). Secondhand games aren&#x27;t taking food out of developers mouths, inability to quickly adjust price to match actual value is. Shutting down the secondhand games market is a cartel/monopoly tactic, not actually beneficial for the general public.",1370926829

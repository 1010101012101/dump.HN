9931221,comment,9928036,9929626,0,0,PavlovsCat,,,"> I don&#x27;t mean to excuse LEOs, but rather to point out that the expectation that they&#x27;re somehow different from the rest of us, is one of society&#x27;s problems.<p>Can you elaborate a bit? In what way are they &quot;no different&quot;? At the very least they are LEO, unlike all the &quot;rest of society&quot; AKA non-LEO.<p>Are these stats wrong? <a href=""http://womenandpolicing.com/violencefs.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://womenandpolicing.com/violencefs.asp</a><p>And what is the civilian equivalent of the blue shield? How come people snitch on each other all the time for petty things, or even make UP bad things about each other? How come LEO are rather more tribe like when it comes to that stuff, seem to cover up even murder with no problem, and sometimes even threaten the precious few cops who do speak out? How many cases <i>are</i> there of cops blowing the whistle about concrete cops who killed concrete persons? Is that just not being reported on as often?<p>I don&#x27;t mean when something or someone ELSE, the non-LEO society if you will, proved without a doubt that a cop did a heinous thing, and the cop is impossible to defend, that some will condemn that cop as well and distance themselves. That one&#x27;s a given, and if you see a whole lot of cops getting caught horrible things and not very many cops speaking out before anyone got caught, you should be worried IMHO. If you aren&#x27;t, that just makes me worry about the US public as well. But again, &quot;if&quot; is the operative word here, I&#x27;m asking more than claiming this.<p>But this I will claim: The pre-&quot;super-high-tech&quot; era is the last window of opportunity to solve the problems of power and morality.<p>We simply have no political consciousness, at all, anywhere in the world; not in the sense of Hannah Arendt, who said politics is not about life, it&#x27;s about the world, which should be one way or another, which should outlast us one way or another. I would add, so life can prosper in it. Here&#x27;s an idea, to not think about what offends people who are living right now, but to think about what would offend people who might live in 1000 years, that is, what results of our (in)actions would they like, what would they curse our names for, maybe even in between screams of torture. Yes, this takes courage, which I lack as well, but even realizing one should be able to do something but doesn&#x27;t dare, is better than rationalizing it. There&#x27;s at least some <i>measure</i> of hope and dignity there.",1437587950

If you raise additional funding later, this will dilute every shareholder&#x27;s percentage down to accommodate the new investor.<p>Traditionally YC did not have Pro Rata, which is the right to basically participate in the new round, to retain their original ownership percentage.<p>Scenario:
YC owns 7%
New investor comes in and buys 20%
YC dilutes 1.4% (which is 20% of their shares)<p>With Pro Rata, YC could participate in the new round up to 1.4% of the total price of the company to maintain their 7%.<p>Why this can be important:
VCs are like beautiful but often panicky gazelles. They are easily spooked, and find comfort in the direction the herd is going.<p>If an investor in a company in the previous round doesn&#x27;t reinvest, this may look bad and cause them to back out.<p>If YC invests in everyone&#x27;s Pro Rata, it means that there&#x27;ll be no apparent signal for the gazelles to act on.

A number of people have speculated that the parts that got clipped are when the officer is conferring on the radio to try to fabricate a plausible series of events that would justify his arresting her since up until he gives her the order to step out of the car (presumably to arrest her) he has no actual justification for arresting her (cart before the horse). You can&#x27;t be arrested solely for resisting arrest, so he had to come up with some sort of charge that he could claim that occurs prior to his asking her to get out of the car. In his arrest report apparently he claimed she kicked him, which in light of the video evidence is clearly BS, but whoever edited the video was probably worried that if too much of the video goes missing some very pointed questions would be asked.

9931184,comment,9929667,9929667,0,0,davisclark,,,"In Notes from Underground, Dostoevsky nailed the reason computers and science and algorithms will never be able to replicate humanity or predict the actions of man, when he wrote:<p>“What is to be done with the millions of facts that bear witness that men, consciously, that is fully understanding their real interests, have left them in the background and have rushed headlong on another path, to meet peril and danger, compelled to this course by nobody and by nothing, but, as it were, simply disliking the beaten track, and have obstinately, wilfully, struck out another difficult, absurd way, seeking it almost in the darkness. So, I suppose, this obstinacy and perversity were pleasanter to them than any advantage...<p>The fact is, gentlemen, it seems there must really exist something that is dearer to almost every man than his greatest advantages, or (not to be illogical) there is a most advantageous advantage (the very one omitted of which we spoke just now) which is more important and more advantageous than all other advantages, for the sake of which a man if necessary is ready to act in opposition to all laws; that is, in opposition to reason, honour, peace, prosperity -- in fact, in opposition to all those excellent and useful things if only he can attain that fundamental, most advantageous advantage which is dearer to him than all. &quot;Yes, but it&#x27;s advantage all the same,&quot; you will retort. But excuse me, I&#x27;ll make the point clear, and it is not a case of playing upon words. What matters is, that this advantage is remarkable from the very fact that it breaks down all our classifications, and continually shatters every system constructed by lovers of mankind for the benefit of mankind. In fact, it upsets everything...<p>One&#x27;s own free unfettered choice, one&#x27;s own caprice, however wild it may be, one&#x27;s own fancy worked up at times to frenzy -- is that very &quot;most advantageous advantage&quot; which we have overlooked, which comes under no classification and against which all systems and theories are continually being shattered to atoms. And how do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice? What has made them conceive that man must want a rationally advantageous choice? What man wants is simply independent choice, whatever that independence may cost and wherever it may lead. And choice, of course, the devil only knows what choice.<p>Of course, this very stupid thing, this caprice of ours, may be in reality, gentlemen, more advantageous for us than anything else on earth, especially in certain cases… for in any circumstances it preserves for us what is most precious and most important -- that is, our personality, our individuality. Some, you see, maintain that this really is the most precious thing for mankind; choice can, of course, if it chooses, be in agreement with reason… It is profitable and sometimes even praiseworthy. But very often, and even most often, choice is utterly and stubbornly opposed to reason ... and ... and ... do you know that that, too, is profitable, sometimes even praiseworthy?<p>I believe in it, I answer for it, for the whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key! …And this being so, can one help being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and that desire still depends on something we don&#x27;t know?<p>You will scream at me (that is, if you condescend to do so) that no one is touching my free will, that all they are concerned with is that my will should of itself, of its own free will, coincide with my own normal interests, with the laws of nature and arithmetic. Good heavens, gentlemen, what sort of free will is left when we come to tabulation and arithmetic, when it will all be a case of twice two make four? Twice two makes four without my will. As if free will meant that!”<p>I think it comes down to authenticity. Humans can predict the actions of humans, so long as humans act by and large as they think they&#x27;re supposed to act or like the things they think they&#x27;re supposed to like. The moment an individual walks in, an individual who does what they truly want to do when they want to do it, all correlations and inferences and predictors fall to waste.",1437587672

But basically just tell your current employer on the exit interview (if they have one) that you have a new opportunity that you just can&#x27;t ignore.  Don&#x27;t tell them anything in specific, it does you no good and honestly they don&#x27;t deserve any more of your time.<p>As someone else mentioned too, the tech community while seemingly large is not, and it is not unlikely you will run into some of these people at another place.  At the same time work to not hold a grudge, some people are more weak minded (and struggle with it internally) so they go along with the culture instead of standing up to what they don&#x27;t believe.  That isn&#x27;t calling you weak, its calling those that participate, when they know better, weak.  Yes it is a character flaw to some people, but I just don&#x27;t believe in holding a grudge against these people.<p>In regards to a new employer, you never say anything derogatory about a prior employer or manager etc.  Simply because they will have in their head if you are willing to do this to someone else you will do it to them if you are unhappy.  So instead, play the game and just tell them that you are looking for new challenges.  It is even better if you are going to Enterprise from Startup because you can say, well I wanted to gain experience in an Enterprise environment now or something along those lines.  When you have a change in types of business it helps.  Also if you change industry, say from B2B products to B2C products you can use that as your reason for changing.  It is simple and easy and no one really questions it.  Just be prepared for a follow on question about what intrigues you about the B2B or Consumer market etc.<p>Good luck and I hope you find an environment that appreciates you soon.",1437587259

You could argue that time is wasted, but not every intellectual or emotional pursuit <i>has</i> to be oriented on externally viable goals. Time you spend on side projects could also be time you spend on playing a computer game, crafting something, or any other hobby-like activity. Even though the remnants of old projects can sometimes feel like tombstones or failure markers, for some reason we don&#x27;t feel the same way about, say, an old save game file.<p>But most importantly, I want to circle back to the evolutionary aspect: side projects are explorations.

Occasionally, side projects survive and get to pass on their genes in the form of continued development, or partial re-use, or even a commercial spin-off.<p>All of this is fine, and it&#x27;s part of the process many programmers go through.

    2. Add an OFF ancilla bit and rotate it by 1/(2m)&#x27;th of a turn for each satisfied clause, where m is the number of clauses, using triply-controlled m&#x27;th-root-of-NOT gates.
    3. Measure that ancilla qubit
    4. If the ancilla stayed OFF, restart the whole algorithm.
    5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 a total of R times, without triggering the restart (the appropriate value for R is figured out later)
    6. Measure all the variable qubits.
    7. Return SATISFIABLE iff all clauses are satisfied by the measured variable values
</code></pre>
(Note that I simplified the algorithm. The paper uses ancilla bits to hold the clauses in qubits, but they are not needed because they&#x27;re only measured at the end and otherwise only used as controls.)<p>For starters, I&#x27;ll just say that up front there&#x27;s no way this works. It&#x27;s too simple. Other researchers would have tried it. Repeatedly rotating proportional to the amount satisfied and measuring? Too obvious. I would not be surprised at all if a majority of researchers have come up with this idea, tried it, and understood why it didn&#x27;t work. Grover&#x27;s algorithm is more complicated than this.<p>Anyways, why does it <i>actually</i> not work? It becomes clear if we simplify the algorithm a bit more by deferring the conditional restarting measurements.<p>Instead of conditionally continuing the 2-4 loop R times, simply run Step 2 a total of R times up front. Then measure the R ancilla bits you introduced, and restart if any of them was false. This is equivalent to conditionally restarting because a) there&#x27;s no information dependency between the loops beyond &quot;don&#x27;t bother doing it&quot; and b) measurements can always be deferred until later [1].<p>Now make the simplifying assumption that all variable assignments, except for a single satisfying one, satisfy 7/8&#x27;ths of the clauses (based on [1]). Note that applying 7/8&#x27;ths of a NOT will transition an OFF bit into a state where it has a roughly 96% chance of being ON.<p>Since <i>most</i> possible assignments are not satisfying, and non-satisfying assignments have a 4% chance of causing a restart (the satisfying assignment has a 0% chance, but it gets diluted by the exponentially many non-satisfiers), the ancilla bits&#x27; measured value will be dominated by the non-satisfying assignments. Each ancilla bit will have a roughly 4% chance of being OFF.<p>That means the chance of not having to restart is roughly 0.96^R. But the paper says that R increases faster than linear with respect to the number of qubits. So the odds of not-restarting are upper bounded by 0.96^N. That places an exponential multiplier on the running time, because it&#x27;s so unlikely to succeed as N gets large.<p>Therefore this is not a polynomial time algorithm.<p>1: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Measurement_Principle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Measurement_Principle</a><p>2: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karloff%E2%80%93Zwick_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karloff%E2%80%93Zwick_algorith...</a>",1437586425

The freedom guaranteed by the GPL enables society to reach a state in which every individual is not merely a consumer of solutions, but a producer.  In this vision, we all cooperate to solve problems together because solving problems in the world makes the world better for everyone.<p>In reality, problem-solving ability (the intersection of the cognitive ability, skill set, drive, and opportunity to solve problems) is a limited resource.  There are problem solvers and there are sheep, a configuration that results in a natural kind of economy.  &quot;Corporate&quot; with all its lawyers and sales hucksters, i.e. persons not directly engaged in the work of solving problems, are a necessary demon.  They connect problem solvers with users that have problems to solve.  Users, for their part, exist to give us their money as a reward for the work of solving their problems.<p>Whether to support the GPL is really a moral decision about which world you believe in.  Do you solve problems to make the world a better place, or to make more money for yourself?  I personally wish RMS&#x27; vision would come true even though I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s possible.  There are natural limitations to problem-solving ability other than the psychological effects of the capitalist environment on those who grow up in it.  Still.  When you really dig to the bottom of opposition to the GPL, you always find one thing, and one thing only.  Money.  &quot;ME&quot;.",1437585729
9930968,comment,9927771,9929938,0,0,brightball,,,"This is a much longer topic but it boils down to 2 things:<p>1. Switching your database is not easy with or without stored procedures because it will involve down time for the application while the data is migrated, then verifying that it works as expected in the new database with that ORM. You hope for the best, but it&#x27;s always more complicated to switch a database.<p>2. The ORM tends to lock you into the application stack. Switching a part of your application from something like Rails to Go when you need to performance tune is significantly easier and more common than switching the entire database backing the whole system.<p>Beyond those two are the harsh realities of working with large datasets. As soon as a dataset it non-trivially small relying on the application to do core work on it becomes self destructive by adding network latency and in many cases object creation (check some Rails benchmarks on object creation costs). It becomes a big deal.<p>This is not to say that doing the bulk of work in the ORM is bad or that everything should be done in the database, it&#x27;s a matter of balance. The only dangerous opinions on the matter are the &quot;purist to the detriment of all else.&quot;<p>Verifying uniqueness, exclusion and maintaining data integrity should be the job of the database in most cases. That is what it&#x27;s good at. Performing actual business logic on that data should not unless there is a significant performance based reason for it in most cases.<p>In Postgres the &quot;stored procedure&quot; thing is a little bit different because they&#x27;re significantly more valuable thanks to the volume of functionality built into PG. Everything is basically a function in PG.<p>In PG, you can use functions to create indexes and when the function is used in a where clause that index will be used. You can use functions to create constraints, unique indexes and even notify outside process that are listening of changes in the database with pubsub.<p>PG is a heck of a lot more than just a &quot;datastore&quot; and that&#x27;s why these discussions are important. If you want a generic dumb datastore...there are databases built for that. PG is built for a whole lot more than that.<p>Here&#x27;s a very incomplete summary: <a href=""http://www.brightball.com/postgresql/why-should-you-learn-postgresql"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brightball.com/postgresql/why-should-you-learn-po...</a>",1437585724

Most of the well developed accelerated dynamics methods only work well for solids where there is a well defined time scale separation between atomic lattice vibrations and reactive events. In liquids (e.g. protein folding) the timescale separation is not as well defined. There seems to be complexity at every level (vibrations, small rotations, dihedral angle changes, etc). Liquid like systems have a very rough potential energy landscape with an enormous number of shallow minima that must be explored to understand the dynamics.<p>I look forward to the clever algorithms that will be developed that will enable modeling liquid systems on the experimental timescale. This is recently become possible in some solid-state systems, but it will take some time and effort before it happens for liquids.

Getting 2k req/s out of a Heroku free tier is just awesome ontop of all the overhead convenience you provide. Great job, great documentation, all around looking fantastic. You deserve to be on HN homepage.<p>Second, I&#x27;m an author of a distributed database (VC backed, open-source), so I&#x27;d like to respond to some of opinions on databases voiced in this thread - particularly in the branched discussions.

If inflation goes up even a little bit...<p>- &quot;The problem is scaling your database&quot;, I can confirm that this is my experience as well. But there is a very specific reason for that. Most databases are designed to be Strongly Consistent (of the CAP Theorem) and thus use Master-Slave architecture. This ultimately requires having a centralized server to handle all your writes, and this becomes extraordinarily prone to failure. To solve this, I looked into Master-Master (or Peer-to-Peer / Decentralized) algorithms for my <a href=""http://gunDB.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gunDB.io/</a> database. Point being, I&#x27;m siding with @3pt14159 in this thread.<p>- &quot;Sorry but databases are just a hole to put your shit in when you want it out of memory&quot;, I write a database and... uh, I unfortunately kind of have to agree, probably at the cost of making fun of my own product. You see, the reason why is because most databases now a days are doing the same thing - they keep the active data set in memory and then have some fancy flush mechanism to a journal on disk and then do some cleanup/compression/reorganizing of the disk snapshot with some cool Fractal Tree or whatever. But it does not matter how well you optimize your Big O queries... if the data isn&#x27;t in memory, it is going to be slow (to see why, zoom in on this photo <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/X1Hi1.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/X1Hi1.gif</a> ). You just can&#x27;t get the performance (or scale) without preloading things into RAM, so if your database doesn&#x27;t do that... well what @batou said.<p>Overall, I urge you to listen to @3pt14159 and @batou. PostgreSQL is undeniably awesome, but please don&#x27;t fanboy yourself into ignorance.

Because I&#x27;m not aware of many that are clear-cut (of course, there&#x27;s environment-gene interplay, but that is way more murky than anything talked about in the article or in the OP&#x27;s comment).<p>I&#x27;m not saying that those claims were false and therefore all such claims are false. I&#x27;m saying that in the West we&#x27;ve spent a lot of time trying to prove that non-white men are inferior in different ways. Arguments like &quot;unconscious bias comes from evolution&quot; ignore that long history of non-white-male qualities being judged inferior.",1437584584

And there was indeed quite a bit of cracking UConnect and wirelessly spying on Dodges and Chryslers throughout the country before the experiment.<p>If I were an auto manufacturer, I wouldn&#x27;t wait until someone finds a wireless exploit (at which point it&#x27;s too late to do anything about it before people die or are maimed unless I&#x27;m lucky enough for the zero-day to be found by a white-hat or grey-hat).  I&#x27;d see those earlier reports, say &quot;holy shit if we have one wireless bug, the whole car could be pwned&quot;, and start working on a better isolation of critical systems from internet-connected systems <i>immediately</i>.",1437584574

In each case, it&#x27;s because they stumbled into a business that was unexpectedly profitable, but which wasn&#x27;t something that they really wanted to be in.  Usually it&#x27;s not something that can really be <i>sold</i> either - typically they&#x27;re taking advantage of temporary market niches, are too small to be of strategic value to a big player, and have a geographically-distributed and lightly-attached employee base that&#x27;s not a good candidate for a talent acquisition.<p>Under these circumstances, usually the most rational course is to treat the business like an annuity: while it lasts, milk the profits, do all the stuff you really want to do like travel the world or write a book, and save up a bunch of money.  The gravy train will end eventually, but they never wanted to be in this business in the first place, so &quot;losing the company altogether&quot; is a plus.",1437584555

You have three years of runway before getting resounding success or having to pack. At the end of these three years you have to compare your gains against what you&#x27;d have gained saving some more.<p>If you start your thing, the initial years will be in the red. If it works out in the end, you are looking to gain your saving back, plus the years of missed gains, plus the interest you&#x27;d matured having money<p>When you start grtting enough money to hire someone to maintain the company and start gaining passively you aren&#x27;t actually passively gaining from the beginning: you are still a lot in the red. So it&#x27;s moral to me wanting to keep a share of the company earnings, so I&#x27;d be able to sustain another venue.<p>Also it doesn&#x27;t seem so bad to profit from an idea one had to enter a new market, niche or otherwise.

There is nothing special about Haskell that makes this possible, and nothing special about ML that inhibits it.  It’s all a mode of use of modules.<p>So why don’t we do this by default?  Because it’s not such a great idea.  Yes, I know it sounds wonderful at first, but then you realize that it’s pretty horrible.  Once you’re in the IO monad, you’re stuck there forever, and are reduced to Algol-style imperative programming.  You cannot easily convert between functional and monadic style without a radical restructuring of code.  And you are deprived of the useful concept of a benign effect.<p>The moral of the story is that of course ML “has monads”, just like Haskell.  Whether you want to use them is up to you; they are just as useful, and just as annoying, in ML as they are in Haskell.  But they are not forced on you by the language designers!</i>",1437584479

Also, you can think you understand things so well that you have to revisit things you think you know in order to find new questions.<p>> It isn&#x27;t remotely the class of the hardest problems we can think of. If NP=P that doesn&#x27;t mean we can solve every problem easily. But it does mean we can solve a lot of important problems easily.<p>That&#x27;s fine to you, but there&#x27;s obviously some communication and definition of terms problems going on, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s entirely surprising considering how lost everyone tends to get in the language of it.<p>P=NP means you can get computers to write their own math proofs.

9930839,comment,9929590,9929590,0,0,tokenadult,,,"The key idea is that genetic variants that have strong phenotypic effect through variation in just one gene are mostly rare, and genetic variants influencing most human traits of interest (heart disease risk, cancer risk, physical stature, alcoholism, IQ score, etc.) act in combination with many other gene variants, each of which alone has weak effect. This is the consistent finding of genome-wide association studies (GWASes) as those studies grow in sample size and in sophistication of the statistical analyses applied to them. Most gene variants in the human genome have nil effect on phenotype or such a weak effect that the influence of that one gene is undetectable even in GWASes with hundreds of thousands of subjects. So the word &quot;rare&quot; in the submitted article title (from the article description in the original article metadata) is the key word here.<p>These rare gene defects with strong effect on phenotype are likely to be helpful in illuminating the biological pathways involved in individuals developing those phenotypes, if the individuals are studied thoughtfully in clinical studies and especially if genetic engineering in an animal model can replicate the effect. But many of the diseases and disorders that you and I most care about will not be understood through this kind of research, because those diseases and disorders are already known to be polygenic (influenced by many genes, each of small effect) and multifactorial (subject to influence both from genes and from various environmental factors, some of which are very poorly understood). Identical (monozygotic) twins differ for many traits of interest, showing that influences other than genetic influences still make a difference in human development.",1437584434

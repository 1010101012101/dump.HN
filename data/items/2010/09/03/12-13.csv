1659378,comment,1657740,1658700,0,0,wazoox,,,"I'm pretty sure that the ""weird sound"" we hear are the reverberation early reflections. Reverb processor introduces a slightly delayed and damped set of reflections (10 to 250 ms late), so what we hear is the first note attack, slightly lower than the sustained note (the singer starts a bit low and corrects herself along), that gives that effect.<p>I've been a sound engineer until 1996, and I know that auto-tune definitely use some formant-aware phase shifting, so that a slight pitch correction (up to a couple of commas) must be essentially inaudible if properly used. Heck, back in the 1980s when we only had Eventide H3000 to save a poor performance, we could make a convincing approximation of the auto-tune effect in post-production, and when the digitech vocalist MV-5 became available, it made a really decent job at real-time pitch-correction, and it was back in 1995.

1659375,comment,1658380,1659328,0,0,ErrantX,,,"I'm somewhat confused by your argument (actually; entirely confused). Perhaps a quick refresher of Evolution is useful.<p>Basically there is a wide misconception that mutation and NS <i>is</i> Evolution. This is something of a well taught fallacy.<p>Evolution consists of three parts - Variation, Mechanism and Outcome. The first of these, Variation, relates to the physical phenomena that cause changes in organisms. One of these is mutation; which is a random action at the <i>gene level</i> causing something different to occur in the organism. There are several other things that can cause variation in an organism.<p>The second is Mechanism; which is the process by which individual variations take effect across a ""population"". This is, in effect, the guts of evolution - and one of the main parts of that is Natural selection (which is an easy theory to comprehend). The thing to remember about NS is that this is a very very slow process; if one variation is favoured this is not a process that occurs from one generation to the next. NS works best in larger populations - so the progress of multiple variations through the population can take hundreds, or thousands, of generations.<p>The final part of Evolution is the outcome of the progress of variations across a species; this is more about the phenomena we observe (i.e. that we are adapted to our environment, or that two species ""co-operate"" at a very basic level). This is the guts of your particular problem. Mutation is a pretty provable phenomena because, well, we see mutation all the time!<p>Your original post made this note:<p><i>If you have a really good team of tester and code reviewers, but no one submits any patch (or, no one makes any change), then the software will not evolve on its own. It will not get better just because there are a lot of people to test it. It needs other people to make changes/submit patches.</i><p>Consider a more ""true to life"" version of your example; a program exists that can compile and produce a version of itself as well as doing some other specific task. People download V1 of this program that, say, flashes a pixel on your screen. As the program compiles itself a random ""mutation"" may occur in the code - adding, removing or changing something. Programs that don't work are discarded (naturally) and those that do something extra or cool are favoured. Over the course of millions of generations you will end up with a number of highly evolved programs - for example a network scanner, a web browser and a word pad.<p>Your mistake is in assuming a system that requires an intelligent input.<p>You seem to be suggesting that it is unlikely for mutation to create useful variations; this is also a fallacy because mutation is random. So despite being unlikely it is not impossible; please remember we are not talking about a mutation that suddenly means the offspring grows a lung - that is a common misconception. We are already highly evolved over millions of generations - so it is a lot harder to observe directly in current organisms. But we can observe it in bacteria who adapt to new situations through mutation. That is the basis of the whole shebang.<p>The theory of evolution has survived this challenge a number of times without being proven fallacious.",1283518524

1659371,comment,1659020,1659020,0,0,jrwoodruff,,,"I just disagree with this. I think complexity is laziness on the part of the designer, the marketing team and the management team that probably demands their products appear complex.<p>For instance, the washing machine that needs two buttons but has 20. Two buttons on a washing machine, if designed well, is a great marketing opportunity. BUT you would have to design it with a way to SHOW the user all of the things that the machine is actually doing, like how the prius shows you what it's doing. Give it a sleek, standout design, and you've got a high-end, high-dollar washing machine.<p>Thing is, that means someone has to step outside the box and do something different than their competitors. Slapping lots of 'features' on a machine is cheap and gives the sales guys lots of fodder for B.S., no extra training required.<p>Look at Apple's products, look at the Toyota Prius. Complex machines that simplify the tasks they do. And they're selling very well.<p>Ultimately, design and marketing have to make simple mean more, not less, to middle America. And someday, probably soon, when every washing machine has 20 knobs and I need to push 10 buttons to toast a piece of bread, simplicity will be the new selling point.",1283518442

1659356,comment,1659280,1659280,0,0,demallien,,,"OK, firstly a nitpick - feature creep is not the same thing as cruft as Stephenson describes it.  Cruft is specifically about the code, and how under the hood everything gets very messy.  Feature creep (to continue the car metaphor) is more like having a very busy dashboard.<p>Secondly, the reason that iTunes has become this kind of catchall application is because Windows users do not like installing new software on their computers.  Just about everyone has iTunes installed, so when Apple wants to add new functionality to the computer part of it's vertically integrated stack, it is easier to get users to adopt the software by inserting it into an already existing program than it is to get users to install a new program.  In turn, it is easier for users as well - instead of having a myriad of different applications to manage on their computer, they only have one.  This of course doesn't apply to Mac users, where Apple can push updates to as many apps as they want in a synchronised manner.<p>Thirdly, as anyone that uses Apple products knows, it is often possible to simplify a product so that the 90% use case is very simple, but at the expense of making the 10% use more difficult/impossible.  No, I don't have to worry about how iTunes stores my files, the app does it for me, but if I'm a power user and I want to install my music library on a separate hard drive, or set it up to be shared between multiple computers, all of a sudden it's not so easy to use any more.  That said, iTunes is easy to critique on this score - why all of those different views of your media, for starters.  Or at least, I can understand your book collection looking different from the TV show colleaction, which looks different to the film collection, which in turn looks different to the music collection, but why allow the user to choose which view they want for which media type - this is a most un-Apple like way to do thigngs, and they really should think about cleaning out some of this extraneous stuff, to once again simplify the interface.",1283517897

Lower MP gives you less noise but it won't give you more resolution. In the extreme case where you push the ISO maybe the extra noise can overcome the extra resolution. To make it simple lets say that at base ISO on a sunny day the higher MP will out-resolve the lower MP for a given sensor generation.<p>My point isn't that low MP isn't good for many applications it's that saying that higher MP doesn't lead to higher resolution is just wrong. If you want resolution you need pixels to produce it and current cameras are mostly not wasting the resolution away.<p>The excessive MP problem only really exists in consumer compacts. High-end compacts and DSLRs haven't been stretching the limits too much. The highest MP DSLRs right now have 24MP on a full-frame sensor, which is about the same density as 10MP on an APS sensor. Some of the APS ones have pushed that on to ~16MP with accompanying improvements in the individual pixels.

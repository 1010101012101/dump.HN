He is diversifying a heck of a lot of exposure away from a stock that is now at the mercy of the public equity markets. Besides, in relative terms, he is still retaining the vast majority of his wealth tied to Facebook stock.<p>His performance as a CEO is essential to ensuring solid performance for the company, but the stock price - like every other public share - is now at the mercy of macro variables that affect the performance of the equity markets as a whole...<p>Mark Zuckerberg is being prudent in diversifying a fraction of his exposure away not just from FB, but also from the asset class and perhaps even the currency / country.<p>C'mon, is anyone here willing to admit that they would not cash-out a small fraction of $18 bn tied to a single stock if you had the ability to do so??",1337831984

4016709,comment,4014400,4016598,10,0,grellas,,,"No, there are no Ninth Circuit precedents saying APIs are protectible by copyright. I am referring to the <i>Johnson Controls</i> line of cases that specify that software is to be analyzed piece-by-piece (including its ""structure, sequence, and organization"" - a judge-invented doctrine) in determining which pieces are expressive and which are functional. This line of cases makes it virtually impossible for a trial judge in this circuit to conclude as a matter of law that any specific element (such as the menu structure in <i>Lotus v. Borland</i>) is categorically excluded from copyright protection as falling within 17 U.S.C. sec. 102(b) (which excludes ideas, systems and methods of operation, etc. from copyright protection). Since SSO obviously has expressive elements to it, it also virtually forced the judge to instruct the jury that the SSO for the APIs could be infringed if they found that such expressive elements existed (a point which Oracle argued vigorously, e.g., by emphasizing all the creative choices an API developer makes in designing the API structure).",1337831951
4016708,comment,4013292,4016614,3,0,stickfigure,,,"It's rare because RPC & filesystem access is usually wrapped in a library or module which does not have any business knowledge of the task at hand.  A more realistic example is your getUser() call which calls 10 stack frames down to a filesystem access, and let's say you get a filesystem error.  The natural thing to do is throw an exception which goes up all 10 stack frames and gets caught by getUser(), which provides some sort of ""sorry, internal error"" message to the client.<p>The notion that typing ""if error return error"" through 10 stack frames makes you think more clearly is absurd.  Decades of C experience has shown that lazy programmers will ignore critical error conditions and introduce hard-to-find bugs because execution plows ahead past the original error.<p>Whether getUser() returns an error object or throws an exception is a question of high-level API design.  Sometimes UserNotExistsException makes sense, sometimes a null (or error) result makes sense.  That is an entirely separate issue.  Any designer with significant experience will use both approaches as appropriate.",1337831890

4016706,comment,4016248,4016628,2,0,bmelton,,,"Thank you.  I don't know where the 'young bucks' demarcation point is, but I, at 34, can remember when I was either willing to forgive my idols for their transgressions or wasn't.  And I also remember that feeling you pointed out of either rationalizing it or being unable to, and it mostly having to do with how I felt about them before I found out about whatever thing they did that crossed me.<p>I don't remember when it happened exactly, but I've since grown to the point that I can separate someone's good qualities from their bad.  I hate Ben Roethlisberger for his off-field behavior (and because I'm honor bound by being a Ravens fan,) but I won't let that delude me from thinking he isn't a quarterback that most teams would kill to have.<p>Maybe it's just seeing more and more of your idols fall away as it's hard to find anybody who honestly doesn't do something that irritates you in some way, and in just the way your closest friends do.  Everybody put on a pedestal will eventually fall off, or failing that, die.<p>Anyway, I'm rambling at the moment, but your post touched a chord, and hopefully people can appreciate the truth in it before rushing to rationalize it.",1337831838

Your Same Niche Idea can become niche plus X, Y, and Z, making it no longer Same Niche Idea. Harder than #1, but worth considering.

4016693,comment,4016248,4016248,19,0,haberman,,,"This is a low-quality essay that is not worth discussing directly.  (Meta-note: see, it's possible to have firm opinions without being abusive).<p>I just want to add that there are plenty of outstanding engineers with very high standards who lead projects without going on the kinds of abusive rants that Linus is known for.  For example: Roberto Ierusalimschy (Lua), Matz (Ruby), Ian Lance Taylor (Binutils, GCC, Gold linker), Shawn Hargreaves (Allegro, works at Microsoft now), Jeff Dean & Sanjay Ghemawat (two of Google's most senior engineers), just to name a few.<p>These guys don't compromise their opinions or let crap into the code-base just to be nice.  But they're all really nice guys who don't rip into people for being wrong.  When you see messages from them on a mailing list, you get a warm feeling because you know they are going to be insightful, accurate, terse, helpful, and friendly.<p>Some people like the machismo that comes from people like Linus.  It's like watching superhero movies and rooting for the guy who kicks ass against the bad guys.  But I think ultimately this is not a healthy way to lead a community.  If you speak in a way that triggers people's defense mechanisms, you make it harder to rationally evaluate the issues.  If you ridicule people for their opinions, you aren't giving them an out that lets them change their mind later; a person is inclined to dig their heels in rather than look foolish.",1337831567

But I find it does wonders for clarity/readability. Using ""regular"" control-flow for error conditions and the ""happy path"" makes code much easier to follow; this is as opposed to trying to intuit the different ways control can jump from the happy path into the error handling.<p>Also, I find that having to write the ""if error return error"" makes me pause to think about how to handle errors properly. For example, if the function I'm writing literally cannot proceed I will return the error. If its a really weird place to be getting an error, write it to a log and return the error.

Backed by Redpoint, FF venture capital, etc",,"<i>|FNAME|</i>,\n\nThank you for believing in our vision, for investing in your people, and for your encouragement and support as an early adopter of the BetterWorks perk offering. Its been quite a journey for our amazing team and we learned a lot along the way. Im proud to have earned your business as a valued customer and advocate for making work rewarding.<p>I'm writing to let you know that after extensive consideration, weve decided to close down the BetterWorks perk platform. The platform will continue to run through May 31st, 2012, at which point it will no longer be active. Our decision came as a result of not being able to sustain a large enough market relative to the high cost of customer acquisition and we realized that reevaluating our company strategy was the right next step. We know our customers love using BetterWorks and enjoy the cost saving and efficiency it drives every day, thank you again for your business over the past months. <p>On behalf of BetterWorks, I apologize deeply for the inconvenience this creates for your workplace. We realize this affects employees currently using the platform, but we still believe in our core vision that employers should invest in their people. We recommend immediately communicating proactively and also considering reallocating your BetterWorks dollars to something that you and your people choose together as an easy way to keep your company engaged and happy. We will do everything we can to minimize the impact to your company during this period of transition. Here are some key details to be aware of:<p>Account Closure\nAll accounts will be automatically closed at midnight on May 31st. We will communicate with employees this week over email in the coming days and remind them to spend unspent budget and of the key dates to be aware of. Please do the same to ensure employees are aware.<p>Budget and Personal Spend\nThroughout the remaining days in May, employees may continue use the platform to make perk purchases on personal credit cards or using budget; however this will end at midnight on May 31st, 2012. Any unspent funds will not be charged of course. All personal and credit card information will be deleted from the system at this time.<p>Monthly Memberships\nAll monthly memberships will be cancelled at the end of May 2012. Many vendors will continue to honor BetterWorks or preferred rates for corporate customers. However, this is not a required policy, and we encourage employees to discuss this option directly with their vendor, should they wish to continue memberships at their desired facilities.<p>Vouchers and Orders\nPlease inform employees that prior to midnight May 31st, they must print out any unused vouchers. All existing purchases and vouchers will remain valid through August 31, 2012. Our vendors will honor all purchased vouchers from BetterWorks through this period.<p>Employee Communications\nWell remind employees over email of the key dates and actions they will need to take immediately. We encourage employers to be immediately transparent and proactive about employee communications as well. You invested in us because you care about your people and theres no reason that needs to change. Please make sure your employees are aware of the May 31st site closure date and make appropriate plans following the site closure. We recommend reallocating BetterWorks funds toward ideas you and your people choose together.<p>Final Payment Details\nBecause you are able to make purchases until the end of May, we estimate final charges will be settled within the first two weeks of June. No fees will be charged following the closure of the site on May 31st 2012. For additional information around payment and billing please see the FAQ.<p>Support\nOur goal is to provide an easy transition for our customers during this time. Should any issues arise please email support@betterworks.com or call us at 1-888-601-9675 extension #2 and we will be happy to assist you.<p>Thank you for your support over the past year.\nPaige Craig\nCEO  BetterWorks\nfollow on Twitter | friend on Facebook | forward to a friend",1337829521

2736120,comment,2735537,2735960,9,0,john_b,,,"I'm a M.S. student in mechanical engineering facing a similar situation, except I haven't put any code on Github (my advisor wants to keep it proprietary, but I probably would not bother putting it up even if he were ok with it).<p>I've written around 15000 lines of MATLAB for my research and only a handful of people will ever need to see it. Some is well-structured and nicely commented, but other parts are incomprehensible and were written under severe time constraints. My advisor is not much of a programmer and will not be able to figure it out, and I feel bad for leaving a pile of crappy code to the person who inevitably follows in my footsteps, but I ultimately have a choice between writing fully commented, well-tested, and well-structured code and graduating a semester late (at the cost of several thousand dollars to myself), or writing code that's ""just good enough"" to get results on time. This is a solo project (there is no money for a CS student to intern) and I'm not getting paid to write code unlike a professional programmer, so every second I spend improving my code beyond the bare minimum <i>costs me</i> time and money.<p>Even if I were able to tidy up and publish all of my code, most mechanical engineers would not be able to understand it because most can't write code. Those who can mostly use FORTRAN, although C is becoming more common. Nonetheless, even those who could understand my code would have little incentive to read through 15000+ lines of code.<p>Unfortunately, as far as research code is concerned, a lot of trust is still required on the part of the reader of the publication. I agree that the transfer of knowledge <i>should</i> be handled differently, but until there is a strong incentive for researchers to write good code it will continue to be bad. Especially when many research projects only require the code to demonstrate something, after which it can be put in the closet.",1309989553

2736107,comment,2735537,2735537,19,0,dasil003,,,"For all the talk of ""best practices"" and ""training"" the depressing truth is that guaranteeing correct software is incredibly difficult and expensive.  Professional software engineering practices aren't nearly sufficient to guarantee correctness with heavy math.  The closest thing we have is NASA where the entire development process is designed and constantly refined in response to individual issues to create the checks and balances with the lofty goal of approaching bug impossibility at an organizational level.  Unfortunately this type of evolutionary process is only viable for multi-year projects with 9-figure budgets.  It's not going to work for the vast majority of research scientists with limited organizational support.<p>On the positive side, such difficulty is also in the nature of science itself.  Scientists already understand that rigorous peer review is the only way to come to reliable scientific conclusions over time.  The only thing they need help with understanding is that the software used to come to these conclusions is as suspect asif not more so thanthe scientific data collection and reasoning itself, and therefore all software must be peer-reviewed as well.  This needs to be ingrained culturally into the scientific establishment.  In doing so, the scientists can begin to attack the problem from the correct perspective, rather than industry software experts coming in and feeding them a bunch of cargo cult ""unit tests"" and ""best practices"" that are no substitute for the deep reasoning in the specific domain in question.",1309989376

The article does observe that the code is great from an academic but not professional standpoint, but it gives reasons why that is the case. There's nothing ad hominem about the article.<p>If anything, your comment is more of an ad hominem -- rather, the positive version of the same, an argument from authority -- with the implication that F/J is probably good since Doug Lea wrote it.<p>> The complexity criticism sounds a bit like ""I don't understand this code! It must be bad!""<p>All complexity criticisms sound this way. Some are true and some are not, and we must attempt to separate which is which. But dismissing the criticism because of how it sounds without actually investigating the claims yourself is not good. ""This sounds like X and is therefore dumb"" is not a valid refutation.<p>It seems like you are trying to undermine some minor points in the article and claim that the whole thing is bunk as a result. What about addressing the major points instead. Can F/J scale across thousands of cores? Is work-stealing task-management actually valid in Java? Is the performance actually good? Is monitoring and stall detection available? Would a better approach use the Unsafe extension less? Etc.

She thought it would be nice to make a plain site that helped folks (our idea of ""plain"" was not so good back then!) We figured using our target phrase as the domain name would at least tell people what we were about.<p>We make maybe 20 bucks a month from the site, and domain renewal is something like 140/year for all the major TLDs, so it's not a high priority right now. The only reason I shared this to try to point out how easy it is to lose traffic and not know why.<p>If I wanted to chase it, I'd go to SEOMoz and check out the backlinks and competition -- did anything change over the past month? Are other sites getting a bunch of links for some reason?<p>Thanks for the great tips! We have a Webmaster account on Google. Didn't know there were options also on Bing. Looking at Google Analytics today, we're still at 13K visitors for the previous month, which is about a 20% decline. It's all still search engine traffic, mostly from Google and mostly for ""tater tot casserole"" Go figure. Is tater tot casserole so popular? Why? These kinds of questions drive you crazy, because many times when you make a site for your startup or topic -- especially if it has a lot of pages, you get all this data from web analytics and it's a bitch trying to make some kind of meaning out of it.<p>Folks are still spending on average more than a minute on the site, which means they are taking time to read the recipes and get some value. That's all that counts for us.<p>BTW, if any of you startup guys want to go into recipes, good luck. She has had this site, with lots of traffic, for a couple of years now, and hell if we can figure out how to monetize it. We did books, kitchenware, magazines, AdSense -- finally writing our own ebook. Right now we're thinking about coupons or some other giveaway product, but I don't have my hopes up. Recipes, at least to me, looks like an income-free zone. One of the reasons we did the ebook was to provide a totally ad-free place to keep track of recipes. We're operating under the principle that people who are cooking hamburger casseroles probably aren't needing anything else at all, at least at the moment they're online.<p>Still, we did it to make something people want that can scale, so no matter how it turns out, we helped people (as evidenced by our emails and traffic stats) and we can learn something from it.",1309989270

2736095,comment,2735980,2735980,1,0,pwhermanson,,,"How do you develop a pricing scheme for a new product that hasn't been marketed before?  At any point in time, the true value of a new product to consumers seems intangible and subjective.<p>It is important to consider what market you are going after when thinking about pricing.  Lets think in terms of art for an example of a new or misunderstood product. If the art is priced just above the cost of materials, say, $75.  What market of people would buy it?  I'm sure plenty of people would see that for its price and think ooh, pretty.  I can afford that. Who are those people going to show off that artwork to? Are they going to talk about it? What about the people that will look at the price and automatically assume that it is poor quality.  OR, are people not defining the work's value by its price, but by the name of the artist?  If the price is low, then that must mean that the artist isn't well known.  Now think about if the artwork was priced at $10,000.  Someone might buy it because they are a collector looking for something in particular and you were lucky enough to give them what they wanted.  Or maybe they will buy it just because they can.  They will pride themselves on being able to show friends and colleagues that they appreciate the finer things in life.<p>Elasticity in pricing is already complicated enough to understand let alone applying it to a real life situation.  But when you add a subjective or new misunderstood product, pricing can play an even more prominent and critical role in how a company is perceived.<p>Check out this book: The $12 Million Stuffed Shark: The Curious Economics of Contemporary Art by Don Thompson",1309989238

The next time you get pulled over with that license, it's lights out.  Additionally, you can't just walk out the door of a DMV with a new license, you have to wait for it to be shipped a real address and if your forgeries are detected before then, police may be waiting to see who picks it up.

There is also reason to believe that light exists in multiple dimensions at the same time.  Example: If Person A is stationary, holding a flash light down a road And person B is in a car traveling down the road in the same direction at 100 mph, also holding a flash light straight   ahead. Which beam of light is moving faster?<p>One would figure that the light coming from the flashlight in the car would be 100 mph more than that speed of light coming from the stationary flash light.  But the light from both flashlights will be calculated to be exactly the same.  How does one explain that?",1309987307

We decided not to do code reviews because we were building a game engine from scratch and the churn was going to be way too high to keep up with.<p>You can claim that code reviews are fast, but when you're generating a couple hundred new lines of code a day that really builds up. Especially when each person is committing 5-10 times a day.<p>What we decided to do instead is go down to the coffee shop below our office every day and just talk about what we were working on, the problems we had run into, and what should be worked on next. As a result, we still had a lot of knowledge sharing going on without having to look at every single line of code going into the codebase.<p>Having a general idea of how the systems are being built and put together is _much much_ more important than going over every line of code looking for bugs.<p>My point, is that the knowledge sharing is what's important. We could have done code reviews, but it was actually a lot easier to just talk to each other for an hour or so a day away from the computers about the state of the project. As a hidden bonus, we also got fresh perspective on implementation ideas before any work was done, which I imagine saved countless hours.<p>This sort of thing is probably less feasible at larger companies, so maybe code reviews are the best way to share knowledge there, but if you're under 3-4 people I'd definitely try this approach instead.",1309986803

We review everything everything before it gets merged into our mainline branch, and the process is pretty much what you described.  Every bug/feature gets a branch, and when it's finished whoever's working on it takes a diff and attaches it to the issue in our bug tracker.  The reviewers look at the diff (or, if they want more detail, pull the branch in question and look at the commit history with more context) and then pull the author in to discuss it.  Every once in a while we consider either some more clever process or some sort of integrated tool to automate more of the process, but we always conclude that what we have works well enough that it's not that big a deal.<p>If your source control makes branching/merging painful enough that it's going to get in your way to do it on a regular basis you might want something different, but that seems like an argument for better source control rather than a need for clever reviewing strategies.",1309986532

2735879,comment,2735494,2735494,5,0,programminggeek,,,"I think that one of the reasons that MongoDB is getting traction is that many people don't use relational databases in a relational way for many projects. Lots of data just isn't as relational as we hope it would be and also people are terrible at modeling data in a relational way.<p>Relational databases were designed around the idea of minimizing storage footprint, and we have nearly infinite storage capacity relative to many databases, so many devs don't care about only having one copy of a piece of data in the DB.<p>Also, SQL is great as a data retrieval language, but it is awful for inputting data. Yes, it works, but writing data to MongoDB in general has felt more natural than generating SQL to shotgun in data.<p>You could argue that ORM's solve a lot of the uglyness of inputting data into a DB and I agree with you, but you still have to deal with table migrations and being able to just add a field in your code and not have to go hold the database's hand or write a migration to make it work is incredibly convenient.<p>In the end, MongoDB solves a lot of convenience issues for programs that don't need relational data or programmers who don't want to use an ORM, create SQL strings, or write migrations to get their database to store their data.<p>It's not for everybody, but if it fits your needs, it solves some problems much more conveniently than MySQL.",1309986190

I'm one of the people that originally started and actively works towards promoting NSCoder Night Santa Monica located in Los Angeles (Tuesday dinners for Cocoa developers).<p>The overwhelming majority of newcomers I talk to were intimidated to show up because there were people (like me) that had at least dabbled with Cocoa for <i>years</i>, but they had just started that month/year/hadn't started at all but wanted to start someday and they felt like they would be out of their league and unwelcome to the group.<p>But you know what? We all have stupid and awesome questions to ask each other. We <i>all</i> have something to offer to the group no matter our experience level. Just showing up and opening up is a huge deal. We have people with all kinds of programming experience spanning decades (including one guy that started <i>programming in general</i> a scant couple months ago). We don't even always talk about programming. It's a very casual event where we talk about film editing (this being LA, lots of people are employed in that industry), baking bread, making ice cream, exercise, photography, and more. The only thing that ties us together is that we all are interested in Cocoa. Nobody is ever obligated to talk at all about anything (other than a brief introduction, but we all share in that even if it's our 50th time at the event) or bring anything to the table if they don't feel comfortable doing so, and I'm hoping that newcomers find this environment to be friendly. The fact that we've had several new people that keep on showing up makes me think we're doing it right :)<p>I know I am a very antisocial person and I really don't enjoy spending time with total strangers, but being an organizer of this event has made me further appreciate the benefits of networking and coming to terms with my being antisocial. Not everyone out there is expecting to hang out with people who are stupider or smarter than them or that you <i>need</i> to do this or that to participate. You won't know that until you actually go and try to at least introduce yourself to people. Don't worry about it :)<p>In the event anything really doesn't work out, start your own group. That was my reason for joining in on trying to organize our NSCoder group. Los Angeles is huge and lots of events I wanted to go to would have involved being stuck in an hour of traffic to get there. Lo and behold, there were other people that thought the same as me and our group was born. We had 15 people show up yesterday night, I think we were pretty successful in that regard :)",1309986154

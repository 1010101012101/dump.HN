They wouldn't have used secret police to terrorize the very class they set out to honor. No, when a system obviously ruled by corrupt thugs strays that far from its principles, I assume the rulers had always been corrupt thugs who paid lip service to the system to sway the masses and achieve power.",1268279924

To simulate some of the functionality of codebubble in vim, I :vsp the same file and scroll up/down to the method I want.<p>I have, however, come to realize that navigation through a large project with keys alone is suboptimal. One typo in a nav command and you have to press at least four or five more keys. With the mouse, you're less likely to make such mistakes and your retry time would also be low. It'd be like trying to browse the web using the keyboard alone... even I, a hardcore vim user, found firefox/vimperator underwhelming to say the least.<p>What would be awesome is if they made some sort of hybrid superintelligent keyboard where the whole keyboard surface could also act as sort of a multi-touchpad.

Patio11 makes some very valuable points and there are plenty of other ways and reasons to make or conclude that it's valuable.<p>2- Social License - The first paragraph of Patio11s response, subsidy, is incredibly important. For the time and cost of attending college it is possible to take a huge number of alternatives . Buy & run a Jakuzzi installation business, start & run a preschool in a developing country. I have a feeling this is the line of thinking inspiring your question.<p>The problem is that <i>you</i> (and the vast majority of other people) probably won't do that. That's mostly because of this social license. Only an extremely radical parent would give their child a hard earned $100k and 4 years room & board to go buy a Jacuzzi business that will most likely go bust but amount to a tremendous learning opportunity. Everyone would think that they're nuts. Nevermind financial support, you are unlikely to find moral support. Not from society. Not anywhere near the support you receive for bumming through the most meaningless of University degrees.<p>I'm not advocating the easiest option. I actually think there is no excuse not to learn a lot at University. I'm also not advocating going where social norms dictate. Far from it. Just pick you battles and be realistic about opportunity costs. Most of the people who don't do the incredible things that you could be doing instead of College aren't not doing them because they went to college instead.",1268279184

In general, every process that isn't core to the web stack <i>must</i> be executed in a completely different tier.<p>Obviously you can still shoot yourself in the foot with poorly written SQL and other things, but a lot of the ""sys-admin"" type mistakes are avoided by enforcing best practices when you start with Heroku.",1268279140

If your classes remind you of a tedious treadmill leading toward the Blub Factory you <i>need better classes</i>.<p>Or a better major. Perhaps you're making the mistake of letting your chosen career dictate your choice of classes. The universal secret to school is: Take the best classes you can find, from the best people, regardless of subject. If the local comp sci offerings remind you of Javaschool, <i>do something else</i>. I have lots and lots of colleagues who can attest that you don't need a major in comp sci, or even a single class, to spend your career working on software.<p>The best bang for the buck in college is the stuff that you can't get anywhere else. Stuff that requires expensive facilities or hardware, for example. Take lab courses -- unlike programming, these are things that are hard to self-study. Biology, physics, chemistry, electronics, mechanical engineering, even art and design (which I suspect is best done with physical materials and a live teacher). Or be a productive dilettante: As I said above, find the best professors in the university and take their courses, regardless of the field. I discovered linguistics that way, and it turns out that intro-level linguistics is a really nice thing to know if you're going to work with languages all the time.<p>If I were to go back I'd probably still take a lot of physics and electronics, which is what I did before, but I'd also be all over the biology and biochemistry. Molecular biology is the ultimate machine language. And I wouldn't neglect statistics: Study as much stats as you can stand.<p>Of course, nontechnical subjects are also important, because they make you write essays. You'd be surprised how useful a skill essay-writing can be. I had a minor in history, and I don't regret it.",1268279109

Okay, I'm with you on that - I think the bloody guerella communist takeover is always going to be a real mess. Rest of comment still stands if you're up for discussing, hope it's interesting and informative a bit.<p>> Just look at what happened after the American Revolution. Oh, wait...<p>Let me ask, seriously - I've done a lot of looking into it, and I'm at this point firmly convinced that socialism is a bad thing. I have no desire to be under a socialist system, and I'd resist if people tried to put me under one by force. Is there any way I could convince you to abandon socialistic thought? You've made a lot of pro-socialist comments. If it is, I'll be happy to keep discussing.<p>The main reason the American revolution gave way to good government is that the leaders of the revolution were largely older and more experienced than any other revolution in history. Most revolutionaries are young, and have no idea how to govern once the takeover is complete. Ironically, I'd point to the large mass of successful businessmen, traders, and capitalists as the reason the post-war government was built well in the United States. People like Franklin and Jefferson knew how to build successful organizations. Washington was an actual conventionally trained British military officer, so knew a fair lot more about organization and leadership than the guerrillas like Che, Castro, Kim Sung Il, Mao, Pol Pot, who were largely lost when it came to traditional structures.<p>So let me ask, if you don't mind - what would it take to convince you either that (1) socialism is largely a bad thing, or (2) you ought to live and let live, and let people want to be part of a collective join, whilst leaving people like me who want to be individuals alone?

1182801,comment,1182329,1182329,0,0,geuis,,,"What correlation is the author trying to make? To my knowledge, Blue Brain has so far gotten as far as simulating a single cat cortical column. In most higher mammalian brains, they are built up from hundreds to thousands of these columns. The approach that Blue Brain is taking is to start with the neurons, making sure the simulations match real-world data. Then wire the neurons into the cortical columns and make sure the simulations match real-world data. The idea is to build from the base components, test the hell out of them each time using the best medical data we can get about how neurons work, then scale to the next level. In this case, hooking together an increasing number of columns to simulate ever more functional parts of the brain.<p>This has crap-all to do with a 'body'. This is such an obvious case of someone not defining their terms that it bugs the hell out of me. In the terms of the Dictionary from Anathem, it comes across as ""bullshit"" in sense 2.<p>We are still at the point where we don't have a whole enough picture to completely figure out the math of what makes a thing ""think"". We have ideas, hypothesis, and some theories. But its all very much in flux.<p>People quite often make the wrong analogy between the discovery of flight and conscious AI.<p>Before engineers knew about how air moving over a curved surface creates pressure differentials that provide lift, they tried to build flying machines by simulating wings. For decades, these people were laughed at by the common folk who believed human flight was impossible.<p>However, once it was discovered how air movement made pressures and it was possible to mathematically describe it, the approach changed. Then the first successes happened. Then there was a huge amount of innovation in the next 40-50 years before the innovation in plane and wing design leveled off.<p>Figuring out how to organize matter so that it ""thinks"" is still being figured out. We have some ideas that are well-supported by data. I feel the approach IBM is taking is among the best. Since we don't know the completely mathematical theory that applies to neuron networks to allow some to be conscious and others not, our best chance is to take as much real world data as we can and to build one in simulation. On the way, we discover all kinds of things we didn't know before.<p>In a way, it sounds like I'm countering my previous argument about how people trying to build wings failed. But, I'm not. It was in the process of attempting to re-create examples of structures that obviously could fly (birds) that we figured out the principles of <i>how</i> they flew.<p>Blue Brain probably won't become THE method of building AI in the future. However, its one of the first massive attempts to do the modern equivalent of building a wing from the atom up. Along the way, we will start really figuring out exactly what needs to happen to make one network of neurons conscious, and another one not conscious. Then we'll be able to take those mathematical algorithms and start playing with them.<p>Eventually we will get to a point where we can test an entity for consciousness. Once we can scientifically describe how consciousness works, we can devise tests for neuronal networks of any complexity to say if its actually conscious or not. This opens up the prospect of seeing if other animals on earth ranging from ants to dolphins are conscious in the same way that we are (or not).<p>It also gives us an actual true test for AI consciousness. If we see the same or similar results on a human that we do for an AI, its fairly obvious that if the AI says ""I think, I am"" then it probably is.<p>I've always had a problem with the Turing Test. Its too subjective. Just because you can fool 8 of 10 people, or even 10 of 10 people into thinking something typing to you is conscious doesn't mean it is. You CANNOT determine that without analyzing the structure of the mind that you're communicating with. If that mind is based on biology, you examine the network of neurons. If its based on software, you analyze the structure of the programming and the flow of data. Since the biological systems and software systems would both be using similar patterns of information to describe their structure and functioning, the same tests apply to both.<p>Sorry to get off on a rant.

Or a mechanic without four extra cars in his backyard.<p>I'm sure Heoku is a great deal if you don't have the sysadmin skills.  My skills are just good enough and I manage my own box.  I bought it 5 years ago..4 cores, 8 GBs, 73GB RAID-1...for $5000.  I pay $105/month to host it.<p>This is at least the equivalent in horsepower of what you get from Heroku for $500+ a month (that's being generous).  So in a few years, I'm ahead of the curve: $11,300 vs $30,000.  Add in the fact that I paid down $5000 in advance as a capital investment and I'm still ahead.  You could do this today for under $3000 capital investment and have an even more capable box.<p>Sure there's risk I'll have a hardware failure (I did have 3 years 24 hours on site warranty, but that's still potential downtime and headaches).  But there is also risk that over the course of that time you will want to run things on your server you did not anticipate when you started.  It certainly was the case for me.  e.g. I started my app in rails then switched to merb.  Now I run a second site on the same server with mongodb and solr.<p>Bottom line, if you have moderate linux skills and know your going to be in ""some business"" that requires you have a server, buy your own.

1182755,comment,1181742,1182386,0,0,jrockway,,,"geocar's response is pretty good, but I am going to disagree on some points.<p>Hyperlinked call graphs: nope.  Never needed it, don't know how to generate them for any language I use.  Emacs can't do it, but neither can anything else.  Write the code to do the work, and Emacs will support it in about 30 seconds.<p>All use of a given symbol: same problem.  The static analysis for this is Really Hard, and it would provide me with near-zero value.<p>Background compilation: yup.  Supported by pretty much every mode.<p>Refactoring: I've used Eclipse, but I've never had good luck with its refactoring tools.  The automated refactorings are <i>almost</i> what I want, but since exactly what I want is so simple, I just do it manually.  If you are renaming your classes everyday and you have to change the name in 1000 files, you have two problems that can't be solved by an IDE.<p>Keyword completion: excellent.  I was using Eclipse today, and there is a noticeable delay between when I press M-/ and when the keyword was completed.  I eventually learned  to not use that feature, because I can type faster than the auto-completion can ""intelligently select"" the right keyword.<p>Emacs is instantaneous, and right as often as anything else.  And I can expand things other than symbols, like long words in the documentation, or filenames in string literals, etc.<p>As for integration, I find Emacs to be quite well integrated for the work I do.  A few weeks ago, I was writing a Haskell app for use on Windows.  I was really not looking forward to it, until I realized that all the Haskell functionality works perfectly on Windows.  I never needed to leave Emacs; I could test my code (interactively or automatically) from the GHCi REPL and I could build binaries and docs with M-x compile.  Of course, it's just one keystroke to move to compilation errors (in both cases). If I needed to poke around in a shell, I just used Eshell, which works the same on every platform.  Everything you need to do is tightly integrated and very fast.<p>Working with Perl is just as nice; one keystroke runs the test suite in a nearby eshell, another just runs the tests that pertain to the current file.  Anything I want to do is usually one or two keys away, and a shell to do something complicated is just as easy to get to.  (For me, C-x C-x switches between the shell and the most-recently-used buffer.  Fast!)<p><i>Their UI's tend to be a lot more powerful because they are not designed to be run on windowless environments.</i><p>Not true.  But one thing that's nice about Emacs is that you can run Emacs in the background and connect to it multiple times.  If your X session dies, no information is lost.  If you are poking around in a shell, you just ""emacsclient -t file"" (which I alias to ""ec file"") and you are instantly working with that file in your normal Emacs session.<p><i>for large projects I use an IDE with a Vim emulation plugin</i><p>That means you are probably unaware of about 90% of Vim's features.  I've watched many experienced Vim users try to use various vi emulation plugins for Eclipse, and there is always a lot of cursing involved.  They eventually just invoke Eclipse functions from vim instead.<p>The underlying theme here is that IDEs make tasks that you perform once or twice a week really simple.  The ""traditional editors"" don't do much about that; instead they make the things you do 10,000 times a day really really simple.<p>(One other thing I notice is that IDE users tend to ignore features that Vim and Emacs have and dismiss them as unnecessary, while Emacs/Vim users steal the good features from IDEs as often as possible.)<p>In conclusion, you don't know much about Emacs.",1268276678

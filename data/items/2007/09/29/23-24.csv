The reason Bill Gates has the money to deal with ""real world problems"" is because his company created something valuable that increased people's productivity. Could he have started his foundation without creating a Microsoft?<p>In general, the road to solving what you call real world problems takes you straight through solving more mundane problems like getting iron out of the ground and figuring out a more efficient process for managing inventory.\n",1191108691

Bill Gates has now gotten old and to the point where he isn't too concerned about tinkering with phones and computers and sees that as being secondary to solving real problems on this world.<p>What's really interesting though is how both men being college dropouts (although for Steve that's a bit generous) and here they are, old and experienced, explaining how the problems (for Steve being creativity and Bill diseases) isn't so much something that can be solved by the collective brain power in college. It requires people to just make an effort and try.",1191107779

Quite a few buildings are connected by walkways, so we would play manhunt or hide and seek around 2-3AM when no one was around. Great fun. Drinking was fun too (stupid of us considering the danger). We used to line the roofs with empty bottles and wait to see how long they stayed up there. They're all still there. :) I miss the roof.",1191107681

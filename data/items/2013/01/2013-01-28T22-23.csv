5131280,comment,5130545,5130545,11,0,dsrguru,,,"Informative article, but slightly inaccurate. General American is not ""considered generally confined to a small section of the Midwest."" This is a myth that I've heard a lot of Midwesterners propagate. Prior to the Northern Cities Vowel Shift, the most identifiable broadcaster accent was probably the Inland North dialect, which is spoken mostly in western New York, northern Ohio, Michigan, northern Illinois, and Wisconsin. That's presumably the source of the myth. But today, that accent sounds very different from most other dialects of American English (for example, their short 'o' as in ""block"" sounds almost like most American's short 'a' in ""black"" and their short 'a' sounds like the non-rhotic diphthong that speakers of RP use for ""air""). I've heard Iowans claim that their accent is the most standard, but that couldn't be further from the truth, as most Iowans have backed 'o's and 'u's a la Minnesota, in addition to subscribing to the cot/caught merger, etc. The reality is that there are seven or so dialect regions in the U.S. with lots of variation from place to place within those regions. Some metropolitan areas have their own distinct accents. In my experience, broadcasters tend to use features from their native accent as long as they aren't from the South or a region heavily affected by the aforementioned Northern Cities Vowel Shift.<p>One other inaccuracy is the article's claim that the British elite had much less influence in manufacturing hubs in the Mid Atlantic where Scots-Irish immigrants and nothern English speakers of rhotic dialects predominated. One specific example they give is New York. In reality, New York English was non-rhotic up until recently, and even now, a sizeable number of speakers either have a non-rhotic accent or drop their 'r's in certain environments. I don't know the history of the New York dialect or whether it become non-rhotic at the same time the Boston dialect did, but I'm assuming New York English was influenced more by Dutch, Italian, and Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants than by Scots-Irish and northern English immigrants, which would explain why it didn't follow the rhotic trend of the other Mid Atlantic cities that the article talks about.",1359413907

They'd be tracking a van and miss the larger context that the van is full of school children.  Nova painted this camera as a way to never lose the bigger picture.  Of course now you've got a massive bandwidth problem.<p>No mention was made of the obvious solution: add a second low-zoom camera.  A basic usability feature would be to click on a spot in the low-zoom area and have the high-zoom camera immediately track over to that spot, making it very easy to flip between several locations with the high-zoom lens.<p>edit: Other bit of bad design mentioned in that show.

I propose that early New York, being Dutch and the most important immigrant gateway later on, probably had a bizarre Duthified English which had a scaled impact on generations of immigrants who came through New York.<p>Similar stories are probably found elsewhere.",1359413600

5131217,comment,5128748,5129258,1,0,salimmadjd,,,"That's not really a fair point. I think it's better to look at their market segment. The people who want a nice-looking (luxury) car, roomy with 4 doors who are environmentally aware. That being said, there are/will be numerous established players (American, German, Japanese) who will provide a vehicle that could fulfill this market segment in one way or another.<p>Keep in mind consumers with certain existing brand loyalty are more likely to buy from your trusted brand before buying from a relatively unknown car maker. Especially, one that doesn't have as many dealership footprints around the country, which further reduce the probability of a sale.<p>You can make the argument of Ferrari who have a niche market and who have stayed in the business despite all the competition. However, Ferraris had/have a long history of racing history and certain brand around handling and driving. They are targeted to that audience.  Tesla sedan is marketed to a whole different segment that could as easily buy a BWM, GM, MB, VW or Lexus before they would buy a Tesla.<p>Tesla is innovative, but their innovation is not something  that can hold everyone else back. I've seen the car and how beautiful the interior and the center console is, but it's not enough to hold the competition back.<p>Lastly, Tesla is yet to offer a leasing plan. Nissan is offering an amazing deal on their Leaf. I looked at it and my projected fuel cost saving was roughly the same as my lease rate. Meaning I could drive a car for FREE for 3 years.<p>So now Tesla is going to move to a saturated market and they need to start adding marketing costs, dealership expansion costs and other unseen expenses to maintain their sales and suddenly they are not going to have the same profit margins and are going gradually get squeezed out. Their only hope is to sell to Toyota or MB who already buy components from tesla.",1359413029

Until the recent Silicon Valley salary wars, the tech industry just didn't pay salaries sufficient to compete with those other industries for graduates. Contrast my brother, who graduated from the same school, and recently from one of HYP. Tech attracted a lot of people in his class. And it's obvious why.

5131121,comment,5130559,5130559,3,0,mnicole,,,"Echoing the article and everyone else that this was an issue for me as well. I had an interview at a small-town agency once with the two owners. They talked to me for awhile, and then walked out of the room to speak privately. When they came back, one of them said he loved my work and he'd hire me today, but his co-founder wasn't comfortable with hiring someone ""so young without any formal education"" and wanted me to come back after I'd done so (haha, right). They actually bickered quite a bit between themselves on the issue right in front of me (which made me feel good), but settled on not giving me the gig. I went about my way, happier that I didn't have to put up with someone who cared more about paperwork than work on paper.<p>A few years later I was working at another agency where my art director was pleading with me <i>not</i> to go to college and to stay with the company (which, honestly I would have had it not been for the keylogger I found implemented by another manager). ""School is a waste of time for talent,"" he said, ""You'll be miserable. Stay here and do real work."" Feeling like I'd rather see for myself than regret the opportunity, I went. It wasn't the private art schools I wanted (I couldn't afford something like that), so I ran into nothing but mediocrity and decade-old lesson plans. Underwhelmed, pissed, and broke, I went back to working.<p>Meanwhile, a girl I know that spent the better part of 10 years receiving design/multimedia degrees has little to show for it by way of skills. While she acquires jobs easily, she doesn't keep them for very long as her talents are so many years behind what people are expecting that she can't do what she wants to/what her degree seemed to ""promise"" her.<p>These days you'll see portfolios splattered with ""~young designer~"" or ""~budding developer & entrepreneur~"" and it completely goes against the spirit of being merited on your strengths rather than your accomplishments-by-age (ironically, I enjoy when kids/younger teens post their age in the titles of their ShowHNs). While it might make the kid feel more competent, acknowledging it is just asking to be underpaid because they know you won't know any better or inherently believe you aren't worth it.",1359412069
5131120,comment,5130559,5130559,1,0,mvleming,,,"If you look to history, you can see overtime we acquire new ways of changing ourselves. There was a time when there wasn't makeup, but nowadays people can use makeup and change their appearance. Same thing with dying your hair, getting a plastic surgery, or arguably even body building: by getting this down to a science, we can figure out how to best change our physique. But really, all of these methods are crude, really crude.<p>But I'm super excited about what the next of couple of decades will do change this. I think we're on the verge of being able to completely define ourselves, and I don't just mean in the sense of designer children, i.e. genetics. I'm also thinking more along the lines of augmented reality and new bionic bodies.<p>Even today, there is a woman, Aimee Mullins, who has prosthetic legs. In her TED talk (<a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/aimee_mullins_prosthetic_aesthetics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/aimee_mullins_prosthetic_aesthetics...</a>), she talked about how she could redesign her legs however she wanted. For example, she could be 6 inches taller, or when she did a fashion shoot, she could have cheetah legs: <a href=""http://img0.liveinternet.ru/images/attach/b/3/17/452/17452836_cheetah.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img0.liveinternet.ru/images/attach/b/3/17/452/1745283...</a>. (NSFW?) At one point in the talk, a person from the audience shouted out ""It's not fair!""<p>And this is epochal, right? This is just a sign of what's to come. You look at Second Life and you see these avatars people have designed for themselves, they have control over how big their chest is, what skin colour they are, height, whatever. I can't help but dream of that being extrapolated to the real world, where we have complete control over how we express ourselves physically. Everybody would feel comfortable in their skin, everybody would look super-sexy, and we would find radical new ways of expressing ourselves (personally I would love blue fur).<p>Now I know what some of you are thinking right now, isn't this really superficial? In Second Life we already see huge tits and perfect abs. In one sense, culture becomes magnified tremendously. The body almost becomes a blank canvas to extrapolate the mind onto. But also, it's not superficial at all, it's exactly the opposite.<p>Let me explain it by posing you this question: what defines you? I've thought long and hard about this, and I've come to the answer: you are defined by what you can't change. When OP can't change how tall he is, he's defined by that, especially so in his workplace. On the flip side, when you can change something about yourself, that is a means of expressing who you are. We can change the style and the colour of our hair, and this is a huge part of culture: just look at all those hair magazines.<p>So what we have here is you are defined by what you can't change and what you can change is a means of expressing who you are. But, and this is the point I'm trying to get at, when you can change something that you couldn't change before, what defines you becomes smaller. So when in the next couple of decades, when we can change our sex, skin colour, physique, species?, what will truly define us becomes an interesting question.<p>And it is in this sense how it is exactly the opposite of superficial.<p>There's a Buddha saying: ""You are not your thoughts."" And you are not your body either.",1359412064

They actually change rather quickly, from generation to generation. Large human migrations tend to homogenize in the sense that they result in a single dialect propagating over a large land mass. But then they continue to diverge regionally over time in rather random ways, to the point where every city in a given country, or even every neighborhood in every city in the country, will develop its own distinct dialect. London is a good example--it's a city that's been inhabited mostly by the same ethnic group for many centuries, and their language tree has branched to the point where people of different districts and social classes there use very different-sounding pronunciation.",1359411844

They would increase innovation, grow the economy and raise employment as immigrants have done throughout US history.<p>However I have to admit it would probably reduce the wages of similarly skilled existing workers at least in the short run. This is basic supply and demand: more supply means lower prices at least in the short run.<p>For example would skilled US programmers be paid as much if any skilled programmer in the world could come here compete for their job? Probably not just look at the prices for contract programmers in India, Eastern Europe, China, etc.<p>However in the long run almost everyone should be better off because the flip side of lower prices is greater volume: more innovation, economics growth and employment as well as lower prices. There are other less understood benefits such as immigrants increased likelihood to start businesses.<p>Also in the long run it won't matter as much where people are located. Eventually most US skilled workers will be competing with similarly skilled workers throughout the world. So we might want to adapt to this future reality now as it will only get harder in the future. People piling up student loans need to know what future wages will be.<p>Overall I think we should be willing to take the risk and accept some disruption now.

There are 122 million Americans 25 or older. That means about 38 million of them have a bachelor's degree or higher. There are 279,000 Americans with bachelor degrees or higher that make minimum wage. That means a maximum of .73% of Americans with bachelor degrees make minimum wage. Adding younger people with degrees dilutes the number further.<p>56.7% of Americans over 25 are somewhere between a high school degree and a bachelor's. If we do the same math above, we get that there are 69 million Americans with a high school diploma but not a bachelor's. And 2.5 million of them make minimum wage. That's 3.6%, which is a difference of about a factor of 5.<p>Dealing with people between 18-25 probably skews the data towards a lower percentage of minimum wage workers more in favor of those without a bachelor's, but I think the point still stands.

Whether that's the rural accents ranging from the Cornish (south west) to Norfolk (south east). Then you have the harsher sounding dialects of the north east - who also seem quite rhotic (or at least, the thicker accents are). Then you have the Welsh and -as mentioned in the article- the Scottish and Irish who all also emphasise their R's (it's quite amusing when I hang out with some of my Scottish friends as they can't pronounce ""Karl"", so every time they call his name, my other friend ""Carol"" answers!)<p>The ironic thing is, the way the English are perceived to speak isn't the way how 99% of English (let alone British) people speak. Even in London and it's overspills (the neighbouring counties), which is where our dialects are the least rhotic, most people don't pronounce themselves in the same way as they do in American TV. But I can understand why the stereotyped accent is used; it's a slower and more clearly spoken - which is ideal for broadcasting where the actor needs to be heard and understood by the audience. Many of the northern accents are spoken with such speed that it can be difficult for an untrained ear; even for some of us English! It's also a sexier dialect (few sane people would fall in love with a Geordie accent, Brummie or even Cockney, if they weren't already brought up in that area.<p>If anyone is interested, I'd be happy to find youtube videos for some of the more distinct dialects.<p>[edit]<p>Just been chatting to my wife about this. She's from the north east of England, I'm from the south. It seems I've overstated the amount of emphasis the north east places on their R's.<p>I'm not sure if I'm alone about this, but the funny thing about pronunciation is the moment you're asked to think about the way you pronounce a word, you've instantly forgotten how you normally talk!",1359410620

Under those circumstances, any government hoops to jump through should not be considered voluntary and consensual.<p>The NYC subway system is particularly sensitive to this, as others have pointed out, because so many people use this to work every day.  You can say the bus is an alternative, but what about when they make a requirement to get on the bus?  (TSA has already been caught at Greyhound stations!)<p>...or looked at from an entirely different angle, why should there be people trying to determine if I have a gun in a bus, on the subway, or on the streets of New York?  Aren't guns legal in America?  The fact of the matter is that it is so impossible to lawfully carry a gun in NYC that the cops, now using these scanners, <i>presume</i> you can't have one.  Imagine a Texas sheriff with a scanner.  ""Excuse me sir, I've scanned you and you have a gun on you.""  ""Yeah, so?""",1359410554

Essentially an overpowered ""calculator"". Main differentiating factor compared to running some app on a smartphone would be a good physical keypad. That would both make input easier and free up lots of screen estate. Being a special purpose device it could be even accepted for tests and that way break into the educational market currently dominated by TI and their 20 year old designs.<p>With all the recent trends around hardware tinkering, such as 3D-printing and cheap ARM-boards, I don't think such project would be entirely infeasible, or even overly expensive.",1359410537

5130950,comment,5128748,5130052,1,0,bathat,,,"Compressed natural gas (ie, not liquefied) is the runner-up to purely battery electric vehicles.  The problems are short range (go read the reviews of the Honda Civic GX: the range is comparable to the middle battery option in a Tesla Model S) and lack of natural gas stations.<p>The second problem can be partially ameliorated by filling at home with a high-pressure compressor (runs on electricity) fed by the same pipe that brings natural gas for your furnace and stove.  Unfortunately, that still requires you to plug in the car overnight, just as you would with an electric, because <i>fast</i> high-pressure compressors are still very expensive.  The compressor, by the way, costs more than an 80A EVSE for an electric car and adds range more slowly.  There are a few public stations that store high pressure gas, but they tend to be at places like airports and taxi maintenance yards, where fleet vehicles congregate (check out Edmund's review of the Civic GX for refill times, though, they aren't nearly as fast as with gasoline).  And compressing the gas still requires electricity.  It is comparatively easier (and cheaper) to set up an EVSE (the ""charger"" stand, although it isn't really a charger) for an electric car than to run a gas line and install a gas compressor.<p>The first problem I mentioned doesn't really have a solution with a short time horizon: You need either more volume (a bigger car) or a tank that can hold more pressure (you think that everyone from SCUBA divers to NASA hasn't been working on that one for the last fifty years?).<p>Liquefied natural gas has it's own set of problems: people complain about the Tesla Model S losing a few miles of range while parked overnight, but the boil-off from a cryogenic container would be far worse (an uncovered dewar of liquid nitrogen boils off in ""a few"" hours; a big 150L dewar at 1 bar will last maybe two or three weeks).<p>It's not that I think natural gas is ""bad,"" it's that as a physicist I can see that we <i>already</i> have technologies that work <i>better</i> (albeit slightly more expensively for now).  The only thing natural gas seem to have going for it at the moment is that it is slightly cheaper[1] than a battery-powered car.  Unless there is a new and obviously-practicable way to greatly improve the inferior technology in a short amount of time, I don't understand why it is worthwhile to spend money developing it.<p>[1] The Civic GX seems be to only available in jurisdictions (like California) that require a manufacturers to sell a certain number of ""zero emissions"" vehicles.  Thus, it is probable that Civic GX's are ""compliance cars"" and that Honda takes a loss on each one sold.  If you want to know this for sure, wait a few years until the full restrictions kick in and all ""zero emissions"" cars are required to actually have zero emissions: If the GX is still sold by then, I'll concede that it is a viable product (though I'd still rather spend <i>my</i> money on a something like a Leaf at that price point).",1359410454

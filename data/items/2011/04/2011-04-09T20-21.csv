2428081,comment,2427610,2427785,7,0,lemmsjid,,,"Agreed, I think the OP is missing the real meaning of the phrase ""don't reinvent the wheel"".  The phrase does NOT mean ""don't improve on the wheel"".  Nor does it mean, ""The stone wheel is and always was great, don't try new materials."" It means, ""Don't create this whole thing from scratch thinking its original and new, when some research will reveal that it isn't.""  In patent terms, it means, ""Check for prior art.""<p>Linus Torvalds (OP's example) had a deep knowledge of Unix before he began what became Linux.  If he hadn't such knowledge, he would have not been successful, for one of the great draws of Linux was its familiarity.  In other words, he didn't ""reinvent the wheel"".",1302382571

Sarah Lawrence College, in NY, lets you take 3 classes a semester, where half of your credit for each class comes from a semester long project that relates at least tangentially to the course subject. I ended up dropping out after 2.5 years to move to SF, but I don't think I would have lasted that long if not for the awesome projects I got to work on.<p>As examples of the type of I did for my CS-related courses: for Computer Science: An Accelerated Introduction (Python), I made an app that parses an iTunes XML dump, hits Last.fm's API for additional info on each track and artist, and uses that data to generate playlists. For Data Structures, I built a 3d printer for the college that uses Java firmware. For Robotics, I implemented a Neural Network-based bot that predicted opponents moves in low-limit Texas Hold Em poker. For another class, I wrote a bot for Eve Online that would perform margin trading.<p>These projects I found to be more valuable to me once I had started my career than much of the time spent in the classroom.",1302382369

Most of the examples listed in the article fit this. If it's what you spend all day thinking about and working on, you're probably better suited to reinvent it than anybody else.<p>Reinventing the wheel doesn't make as much sense for something that isn't your core product. For example, if you're trying to create the next personal financial webapp, it may not make sense to embark on a project to create a new JavaScript AJAX framework or message processing queue, since those aren't your product and there are a bunch of decent libraries already. There are counterexamples to this (Ruby on Rails), but in most cases, startups with limited resources need to take advantage of existing libraries/systems as much as possible. Reusing existing technology frees up more time to worry about your core product.",1302382352

2428059,comment,2427957,2428006,2,0,pemulis,,,"That's the problem with standardized education. Critical thinking and creative thinking are stifled, because it's much, much easier to assign grades when every test and project is based on a simple set of criteria. The students either fulfill the criteria, or they don't. Standardized education is good at teaching students how to memorize information and follow instructions, but that's almost all it's good at. That was fine when schools were preparing students to work in factories, but for our current economic system, it's a complete disaster.<p>If the education system was based on creative projects, employers and colleges would have recognize that the grades are subjective, and not the best signal to judge a candidate by. In fact, grades already a pretty weak signal, since they indicate skills (memorization, ability to follow specific instructions) that aren't nearly as important as they used to be. The most important thing wouldn't be the student's GPA, it would be their portfolio. That's already the case for creative fields, but it's easy to imagine how it could apply to other fields. A portfolio of critical papers for academics, a portfolio of business plans (or, better yet, real businesses) for business students, an investment portfolio (real or virtual) for finance students, etc.",1302382108

Recently acquired by Salesforce and expanding their add-on range means that they will be around for a long time and it is promising that they are catering to a larger variety of developers.<p>Reliability:
They run off Amazon web services which are continually expanding their regions. So they are highly reliable (especially after the EC2 outage in 2010).<p>Cost:
In my experience, heroku has saved me a lot of time and my clients a lot of money. Yes, I can setup and manage my own servers and it can be for as little at $10/month. heroku on the other hand costs up to $100/month for my production servers. Why am I willing to pay this much? Because I put a higher price on my time than $100/month. I don't have to worry about infrastructure or redundancy issues. Furthermore, my clients can afford these hosting costs as I explain to them that $100/month is cheaper than my hourly rate if I have to troubleshoot network/server issues and also perform server maintenance... which none of these I have to do on heroku.<p>Limitations & hiccups:
I've found that I've needed to employ alternative ways of doing things due to some minor heroku limitations. Overall, everything is achievable with some resourcefulness and some extra money.<p>Overall, heroku is easy to get started with, especially if you've got sys admin experience!

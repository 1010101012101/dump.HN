3871628,comment,3871463,3871463,32,0,molf,,,"This sounds a lot like a ""lattice"" organisation. It was invented by Bill Gore, founder of W.L. Gore & Associates (famous for their Gore-Tex fabric). At Gore, apparently everyone is an associate with no specific job title. There are no chains of command or hierarchy. People choose to work on projects based on their own judgement.<p>As Gore grew, it was apparent that this structure did not work with more than a couple of hundred people. So now, teams are limited to about 200 people (approximately Dunbar's number). I imagine Valve will run into this social limit as well once they grow well beyond their current 260 employees.<p>Given that Gore still exists, has 9000 employees and is profitable after 60 years is testament that such a structure can work for small as well as larger organisations over a longer period of time.<p>I first learned about this organisational structure in Malcolm Gladwell's book The Tipping Point.

You don't get the money <i>back</i>, you just get to subtract it, as if you'd never earned it in the first place.<p>How do I calculate these deductions? Well, the first problem is that you will need to keep a bunch of receipts for a couple years, just in case the IRS summons you to account for your deductions. But okay, what receipts should you save?<p>(1) If you donate to a registered charity, it's as if you never earned the money in the first place. This is the least WTF-y part of this idea.<p>(2) If you paid medical bills, you are only taxed on the first 7.5% of those bills (wtf?) -- the rest is a deduction. Old wealthy white folks, rejoice.<p>(3) You also have to pay taxes to your state, because otherwise the 50 states would get into a nasty tug of war over federal money. (But they do this anyway.) These taxes are deductible.<p>(4) Certain forms of interest (mortgages and investments) might not count in certain cases.<p>Since that's complicated and is entirely devoted to making rich people pay less tax, there is also a deduction for poor folk like myself who don't want to keep receipts, and that is called your ""standard deduction"".

(It should be noted Best-First Search is a family of search algorithms, of which A* and Dijkstra are a part of).<p>Here, Best-First Search uses geometric distance (estimated with a heuristic) from the goal to prioritise nodes. UCS uses pathcost only and A* uses the sum of pathcost and heuristic. This means this implementation of Best-First Search will expand nodes that are closest to the goal first, even if it has a high path cost. A simple example is a straight path and a path with lots of twists, with the straight path starting a few nodes further away from the goal. Best-First Search will proceed on the path with twists first, till it reaches the goal. The result of this Best-First Search isn't optimal, since the straight path is shorter. Both A* and UCS will get the shorter path (there are conditions though, UCS needs strictly positive path weights, and the distance heuristic <i>must</i> be an underestimate).",1335009658

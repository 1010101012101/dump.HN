And I think pica said he'd been told to say ""n-word"" instead of, well, the n-word.<p>I have no idea why this was satisfactory to the reddits, since all it did was add a hilarious dash of ironic political correctness.",1184336683

The point of marketing is that can greatly increase your adoption. Even if your product is the best thing in the whole world -- that doesn't at all mean that adoption of it will spread like wildfire.",1184335421
34034,comment,33886,33958,0,0,Jd,,,"Your algorithm suggestion is interesting, but probably not sufficient.  Although reddit trolls are one step up from internet spammers, the same principle applies.  With sufficient quantity of trolls/spammers blocking each one individually becomes an incredibly time intensive task - enough to drive away all those who don't have tons of time on their hands.<p>Pg speaks above about customs, but the problem with customers have to both (1) be educated about site customs (2) want to be educated about site customs.  I think with any influx of 14 year olds of sufficient you will find both 1 & 2 problematic.<p>Now, personally, I think there is a significant difference between a news aggregation site and a community site.  In a community site persons actually develop relationships and relate to each other on this basis.  I have no seen that happen much on reddit or here.  One reason for this is the speed of discussion - most of the best online discussions I have been involved with have taken days or weeks to fully develop.  In any news-blog-digg driven site the time frame is closer to 24 hrs.<p>What I would favor is a multi-tiered system.  For something like YC News there could be something like three tiers: (1) Old school hackers with experience in startups (2) Less experienced coders (3) Whoever wants to participate.  Each conversation could be assigned a tier, and people of that tier and above tiers could participate.  For example, a tier 3 discussion would accommodate people of tier 1,2 &3, a tier 2 discussion could accommodate tiers 1&2.<p>In many ways this model is what we already do.  We have low-tier sites like digg which we may check, we come to places like this for a free form discussion mostly among people of type 2, and type 1 discussions are mainly engaged in via email.  So in some ways the only innovation I propose is that some of these type 1 discussions be viewable to the public, so we can see what cool lisp hackers talk about in private (and solicit them for advice).<p>Response to other reddit comment comments:<p>Fallacy - I don't think the fallacy thing will work simply because (as with the site customs described above) one has to be educated as to what any  given fallacy means.<p>Ethical dilemma - funny I never thought of doing that, although I think your solution would work.<p>Popular comments - yes this is a big problem; I have noticed it.<p><p>

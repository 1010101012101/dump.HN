Build up its strength, the authors suggest, with small but regular exercises, like tidiness and good posture. Dont try to tame every bad habit at once.<p>This is the key. For example, instead of having a bunch of New Year's resolutions, come up with one resolution every month. Focus your (finite) willpower on making it into a habit, at which point it won't require willpower anymore. Next month, move onto another habit and do the same thing.

I can't tell you how often I hear someone tell me that eating better is ""too expensive"" an option for improving their health.  In many cases, it's a matter of a few bucks a month a month compared to sometimes literally thousands of dollars a month in medical expenses.  But food comes out of their pocket and a big medical crisis they think someone else will help cover. I think.<p>I don't get it myself.  Just tossing that out there.",1315081063

Even Amazon is rumored to be about to use it for some purposes.  Apple has repurposed some Mahout code for Genius.  Dozens of other companies use it for recommendation.<p>In the more traditional data-mining areas of clustering, latent variable discovery and supervised classification, Mahout does scale and does deployment very well.  I am a Mahout committer, but I use R all the time, often times for prototyping or for small analyses.  I would hate to have to deploy an R solution, however.  Sampling is a fine solution for the first 80% of gain and if you are in a startup situation, that may well be enough for you.  On the other hand, efficient deployment is usually pretty important as well.<p>As always, you mileage may vary.<p>I would recommend that you pop over to the Mahout mailing list for better feedback.  I doubt that the Hacker News community knows as much about Mahout as the people who develop and use Mahout.",1315080775

The boy's parents chose to wait and rack up a $280,000 hospital bill, but did no  one explain to them that a simple $80 procedure can prevent serious complications? Paying $80 for that one procedure would have saved them their son, and it would've been cheaper than paying health insurance anyway since it's a one-time payment. Cut back on something, anything, just don't risk your or your son's life when the solution really wasn't too expensive.<p>Things like this would be better served by microloans anyway. Patient financing should be looked to as a way of controlling costs rather than forcing everyone to buy health insurance. If the boy's parents had been given the option of paying, say $10 a month over a year for the dental procedure, it would've been much easier on them than paying $80 up front. They could pay less if they make all their payments early.<p>Just give them an option, an option they can understand and afford.",1315080714

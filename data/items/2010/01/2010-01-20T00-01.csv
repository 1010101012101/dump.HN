Most Chinese companies simply don't have the capital to do R&D to the standard of a developed country, and most talents go work for western companies that have the money.<p>If IP laws were enforced in China, Chinese companies would be further kept at the bottom of the food chain, making cheap products in sweatshops at very low margins.  The IP policies in China is meant as way to jumpstart domestic companies by letting them compete in higher-margin value-added goods when they don't have the ability to do their own research.  The policy-makers know that they suck at most things, especially as a venture capitalist, so they go with the least-interfering approach.<p>Of course, eventually they'll have to enforce IP to sustain their own R&D, once their industries mature.",1263949114

We propose that those with limited knowledge in a domain suffer a dual burden: Not only do they reach mistaken conclusions and make regrettable errors, but their incompetence robs them of the ability to realize it. Although we feel we have done a competent job in making a strong case for this analysis, studying it empirically, and drawing out relevant implications, our thesis leaves us with one haunting worry that we cannot vanquish. That worry is that this article may contain faulty logic, methodological errors, or poor communication.

1063719,comment,1063287,1063496,0,0,camccann,,,"Well, I can tell you how Dunning and Kruger did it--they borrowed a bunch of jokes from various sources (famous comedians, joke books, &c.), then had some professional comedians rate the quality of the jokes. The assumption was that making a living in comedy probably requires being able to recognize when something is or isn't funny.<p><i>We created a 30-item questionnaire made up of jokes we felt were of varying comedic value. (...) To assess joke quality, we contacted several professional comedians via electronic mail and asked them to rate each joke on a scale ranging from 1 ( not at all funny ) to 11 ( very funny ). (...) Although the ratings provided by the eight comedians were moderately reliable ( a = .72), an analysis of interrater correlations found that one (and only one) comedian's ratings failed to correlate positively with the others (mean r = - .09). We thus excluded this comedian's ratings in our calculation of the humor value of each joke, yielding a final a of .76. Expert ratings revealed that jokes ranged from the not so funny (e.g., ""Question: What is big as a man, but weighs nothing? Answer: His shadow."" Mean expert rating = 1.3) to the very funny (e.g., ""If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him is 'God is crying.' And if he asks why God is crying, another cute thing to tell him is 'probably because of something you did.'"" Mean expert rating = 9.6).</i><p><a href=""http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/unskilled.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/unskilled.html</a>",1263948657

This leaves actual visible criminal activity to those not smart enough, or not disciplined enough, to take that route.<p>Don't shake your head at how awful it is when a high-up executive at a major corporation turns out to be a complete sociopath.

1063704,comment,1060176,1063594,0,0,morphir,,,"<i>""A knowledge of algorithms doesn't teach you to pick the right problems to solve.""</i><p>That is true. To create a application, one needs a Use Case. A Use Case will provide the most abstract solution to what the app will be doing. Then you can take the top down design approach, by dividing the Use Case into a several abstract sub problems. That is known as code architecture and belongs to System Engineering. The System Engineer needs a domain-expert help to identify what problems that needs to be solved.<p>Then..<p>Programming is carrying out those abstract sub-problems (interfaces) to become a concrete solution using a specific programming language. To complete such a task, one needs a person that knows his/hers algorithms design techniques, sorting, searching, string processing, graph problems, combinatorial problems, geometric problems and numerical problems. And lastly, the analysis of the respective algorithms.<p>Once you know what to solve, its just a matter of being able to carry out the task.<p>I think you might have confused the programmers job with the job of actually creating the entire software - which in general terms is non-sense. To sum up:<p>The software engineer (the project lead) takes care of identifying the sub-problems, after creating the Use Case with the domain expert (often the customer).<p>The programmer solves those sub-problems bottoms up, by focusing on creating the atomic parts as efficient as possible.",1263947819

Bill Gales made silly amounts of money by having great connections, getting lucky, and executing ruthlessly not just working hard.

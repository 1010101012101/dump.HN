Then we can spend months chasing our tail learning all of the &#x27;Gotchas&#x27; of Ember.js. Also, just to make things interesting, let&#x27;s use a bleeding-edge version of Ember.js. Also let&#x27;s do this at a time when articles on Ember.js that are just 4 months old are already out-dated and no longer apply to the current codebase.&quot;<p>Though I doubt that a warning on HN will deter such people.",1428422397

9334924,comment,9333330,9333330,0,0,paulhauggis,,,"This is a great article.<p>Here is my experience with startups:<p>-1 co-founder was a designer and after I finished the product (I&#x27;m a developer), took 6 months to make changes that could have taken a week or two.  Without a boss telling him what to do, he had no motivation to finish anything in a timely fashion.  This failed before it got off the ground, but I built lots of nice libraries that I still use today.<p>-1 co-founder (a developer) gave up after he had to work on the boring parts.  A few years later I gave him another chance.  We were going to start a consulting business together and I figured, because he already had clients, that    things would be different from our previous experience.  Well, he took me to his lawyer and wanted me to sign these completely 1-sided contracts where everything I built in my off-time was owned by both of us (he knows I had other companies).  He also wouldn&#x27;t take any risk and give me ownership in his current contracts, but I had to give up mine.  Before I even had a chance to tell him no, he changed his mind once again and wanted to &quot;wait a month&quot;.  3 months later, I politely told him I wasn&#x27;t interested and he now works a 9-5.<p>-The last time in my poor decision making was partnering up with someone that had no tech (besides checking email, etc) or business experience.  I was to do all of the development and I figured he could learn the business and marketing skills along the way.  His job in the beginning was to do all of the content-creation (which is not easy).<p>Well, after alpha 1 I built the entire site and he created 5 articles (which was enough to get some people testing it).  He was unwilling to learn anything about marketing (because I was better at it as he said) and wanted to farm out all of the content creation to other people (which is a good idea, but not at this stage in the business..especially when we are strapped for cash).<p>So now we are in a situation where he has nothing to do and my job is to: get customers, design the website, fix bugs, and make business decisions.  I&#x27;m basically running the entire business myself and he, as an equal partner, is sitting around waiting for things to happen.<p>So what does he decide to do?  Comes up with un-realistic ideas for future business plans that of course only involve things that I will be working on and not him (since he has no tech experience).  I also had to fight against his ideas and continue to convince him that we shouldn&#x27;t be working on the next &quot;Facebook for X&quot; and on the task at hand that had a real chance at making money.  This involved hours and hours of phone calls and meetings that took me away from the site that was in alpha.  That was another issue: nothing could be explained by email to him, only by phone or in-person.<p>Everything eventually fell apart and it was a very frustrating experience.  He was also a good friend, which made it even more difficult.<p>I feel like some people like the idea of running a business, but have these un-realistic expectations when it actually comes down to doing the work.  I&#x27;ve learned some hard lessons, but I think it will help me in the future when it comes time to find another co-founder.",1428422244

The advise specifically was first an anecdote about working in Japan and going out to get piss-drunk on sale after work and then a generalization of that to drinking as a means to networking in general. My generalization to other drugs is my own. Since there is no moral difference between alcohol and marijuana and there soon won&#x27;t be a legal one.<p>Interestingly I read an article (perhaps it was posted here?) in recent days about westerners struggling in Japan and one key point was the expectation to go out drinking heavily after work every night.<p>I can see the merit in holding networking events surrounding drinking as alcohol will (perhaps) get people to put their guard down, relax and socialise more than if everyone were stone cold sober.<p>I will be interested to see what happens with regards to marijuana and networking events. Though the moral argument against marijuana is gone, there is still a stigma associated with the drug. In many professional circles cocaine is currently more likely to be the accepted drug of choice than marijuana (going by personal experience).<p>Marijuana is also different to alcohol in that one can have a few drinks over a reasonable amount of time and be more relaxed without getting intoxicated, however a few drags on a pipe with reasonable marijuana in it will cause rapid intoxication. How well that bears for networking events is something I&#x27;ll certainly be interested to see!",1428422003

This suggests that &quot;subtle -isms&quot; against less-favored groups might be policed less vigorously. For example, many ordinary white men might reasonably consider the term &quot;underrepresented&quot; itself to be a &quot;subtle -ism&quot;, but I doubt complaints to this effect would fall on sympathetic ears.<p>This issue applies to Hacker News because being inspired by the Recurse Center&#x27;s policies risks importing the expectation that &quot;avoid subtle -isms&quot; mainly applies to speech against their favored groups.

I&#x27;m not entirely sure why, but its as much an emotional argument as a logical one.<p>After I thought about it for a while, I concluded that you have a valuable and interesting point. But every time I read it I keep wondering a couple of things, so since you&#x27;re here I figured I&#x27;d just ask.<p>First, why deny so absolutely that WebGL is 3D? I&#x27;ve been feeling like your point might have more traction with graphics programmers if it left the question open than claim to close the book. Even though you&#x27;re right, you need to do your own math, WebGL still does accept 3d data, and it does 3d operations on that data. WebGL enables 3d graphics, and denying that it does that is inherently problematic, isn&#x27;t it? The argument that amount of prior knowledge necessary to use a library should dictate the category of a library also seems pretty subjective to me, and in my experience doesn&#x27;t generally hold - not many libraries I use are truly black box libraries that don&#x27;t require prior knowledge. My personal use of OpenGL has always involved me doing a lot of 3d math myself, just like my personal use of OpenCV requires a lot of prior image processing and computer vision knowledge.<p>Second, why try to convince the internet that WebGL is 2d and not 3d, as opposed to, say, the Khronos Group? If all the official sources of documentation call WebGL a 3d library, then isn&#x27;t this argument probably going to be futile and never ending?",1428420448

672869,comment,672093,672367,0,0,dkarl,,,"I think Macs are quite counterintuitive for people from the Windows world.  I jump between:<p>- OSX (my home box for Lightspeed/iTunes/Squeezecenter)<p>- KDE3 (my home programming box, and my work desktop until I started using Awesome a few weeks ago)<p>- Windows XP (my work laptop)<p>I feel perfectly comfortable jumping between Windows and KDE3.  They're basically the same logic, the same way of thinking.  OSX, which I'm posting from right now, is entirely different and extremely frustrating for me.  To switch to an app, I click on the same icon I used to launch it?  The menu bar associated with a window lives at the top of the screen?  When I focus different windows, the weird detached menu bar at the top of the screen magically changes?  GUI conventions like these don't make any intrinsic sense.  You're either used to them or you're not.  People who are used to Windows will find the KDE3 conventions quite familiar, whereas OSX will be quite alien.<p>Customization is a different issue.  ""End users"" aren't likely to sit down at the desk of a customization-mad hacker.  They might inadvertently screw up their own desktops, but they can do that with Windows anyway.  ""My entire screen is gray!""  ""Where did all my files go?  They were here yesterday!""  Except with complete computer beginners (a vanishing species) it's a relatively minor problem.",1245884358

AHN only discusses CS, but I'm sure the discussion would not devolve if you included other subjects (ie Physics, Biology). A potential problem is that though you might have read something interesting, it might not quite fit.<p>Perhaps because the articles are dense and require time to read (a prof. told me to expect to take at least three hours to read an academic paper properly as an expert in the field), it would help a lot if the original poster would help jump start the discussion by talking about the interesting features of the experiment or study. I'm not sure if this can be forced though.<p>AHN (completely) aside, I had another idea for a news site that addresses a pain point of mine. I'm not sure if it belongs in this thread, but it seems as good a place as any.\nMany, if not most, articles in the mainstream media are horribly devoid of content, information, and context. An aggregator that posts stories and has a historian annotate them and add links to documents (especially primary source!) describing previous relevant events (sorted by importance and date) might be really cool and useful. I am stumped as to how to actually make it work though as if you do it with personnel, your labor costs would be enormous. On the other hand, there may be a ready supply of liberal arts doctorates who missed out on professorships (I understand there is a major discrepancy between the supply and demand). The real trick of this would be that if you managed to realistically rate historical events according to how they impacted the world, then you could sort your front page by both newness and importance score, thus mining the gems that are misplaced in regular papers. However, this would be susceptible to gaming by writers - which is unavoidable in the long run.<p>Automation would be much better. However, it becomes a classification problem along waaaay too many dimensions, and assembling a supervised learning dataset would be a giant task that I'm not even sure how to do as these labels can be very uncertain.<p>The rewards would be great if some sort of system like this could be devised on a reasonably sized scale.",1245881037

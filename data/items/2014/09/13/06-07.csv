8311795,comment,8311691,8311691,1,0,jrapdx3,,,"While Walter Mischel is enormously accomplished, the ideas described in the article re: self-control appear to be simpler than observation of people struggling with behavioral control reveals.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with Mischel&#x27;s work, though he&#x27;s admirably produced a lot of it, no doubt reading some of it would teach me things worth knowing.  I&#x27;m not assuming the article is truly representative of the breadth of such a prolific mind.  My ideas on the subject reflect what I&#x27;ve seen and learned so far.<p>To say we are driven by limbic system emotion in one way and goal-driven prefrontal cortex (PFC) opposing it would be minimizing the magnificent complexity of our construction.  Thing is, control of our own behavior is limited and the nature of such control hardly understood by neuroscience, leaving us in no position to confidently prescribe methods of self-control in general.<p>It should not be surprising that kids performing better on a test that measures exactly what is successful in school and the corporate world will be more successful than kids scoring poorly.  Academic achievement requires a talent for anti-hedonism, and those not as gifted in this trait will likely not do as well.<p>OTOH the persistent stubbornness (&quot;grit&quot;) required for some kinds of success isn&#x27;t synonymous with pleasure denial as seems to be implied.  Determined persistence has a strong emotional component, individuals with such traits take pleasure in their accomplishments even if others don&#x27;t understand it at all.  They also react strongly to attempts to deflect them from their path.<p>Emotional salience is intrinsic to strongly bound goals, one must have the desire, the drive in order to sustain the effort to achieve.  The emotion is not suppressed but harnessed in service of the mission.  To the goal-seeker, foregoing other pleasures &quot;normal&quot; people covet is not a sacrifice, it is simply unimportant and not missed.<p>In this paradigm, imagine the kid who&#x27;s more eager to finish building the tower of blocks than interested in the taste of candy.<p>History shows us many people built like that: Paul Erlich (chemotherapy), Thomas Edison, Harold Edgerton, among so many others.<p>The saying &quot;knowledge is power&quot; applies, fully knowing what we feel and having the &quot;grit&quot; to feel it, connected to logical problem-solving is a very potent tool.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s what the article about Mr. Mischel was really trying to say.",1410591580

8311786,comment,8308011,8311740,2,0,bane,,,"> It is extremely difficult to get hypercalcemia<p>Not really. You just have to be predisposed to getting it.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand what your point is exactly. You&#x27;re talking about elevated D3 like it&#x27;s the same thing as a high Ca2. And that upping D3 doses turns D into Ca. Serum D is usually not elevated in this case.<p>In hypercalcemics, the issue is elevated Ca2+ not D3. D3 merely improves the efficiency of Ca uptake, which is usually not a problem as most people will dispose of extra Calcium through their kidneys and urine. Hypercalcemics don&#x27;t eliminate it fast enough (usually due to improper parathyroid signaling) and it builds up in their bloodstream. So excess D3 just exacerbates an existing issue.<p>I haven&#x27;t tested as irregular for thyroid or parathyroid issues (I get tested every year due to a long family history) but it&#x27;s likely to be the cause. My dietary intake of calcium is virtually unchanged, but if I up my D3 intake significantly (sun exposure or supplements) it&#x27;s likely that I&#x27;ll also end up with elevated Ca2+ and have to cut both until I urinate it all out.<p>I do actually have to know this stuff and be aware of it since it can literally kill me.<p>Thyroid and parathyroid issues are surprisingly common (especially among women) so people taking lots of D supplements should just be on the lookout for similar symptomology.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to treat once you&#x27;re aware of it. But it can be unfun trying to figure it out.",1410590747

You have some entities/data you need to communicate to the user, through whatever interface/device that&#x27;s available to him. A touchscreen, a keyboard, knobs, LEDs, microphone, speaker, paper, etc.<p>When your &quot;user&quot; is a computer, JSON (while not perfect) seems to do the job as an interface. In the case of humans, JSON does a poor job at efficiently communicating information.<p>For humans:<p>- A calendar is better than &quot;2012-11-05&quot;<p>- A color is better than &quot;#FF3300&quot;<p>- An image is better than &quot;<a href=""http://example.com/image.png&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/image.png&quot;</a><p>- A clickable link is better than &quot;<a href=""http://example.com/document.html&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/document.html&quot;</a><p>The list goes on. We can easily generate a basic UI based on  complex entities, and map specific types to custom/reusable templates if needed.<p>Now that your UI can automatically be generated from data, you can build an app (business model) once, and make it usable (and actually look and feel good/native) on any device. A smartwatch, a smartphone, a smarttv, etc.<p>Basically, the core of software development should be knowledge representation. Describe the world semantically (with RDF or similar technologies), and let the UI-compiler generate a UI for any given target platform, language, culture, user preferences.

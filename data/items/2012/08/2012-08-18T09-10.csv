4400727,comment,4400649,4400649,1,0,shasty,,,"Funny you should ask.  I had a suite of apps for iPad/iPhone and Mac that I submitted to the app store.  Primarily because I wanted to build on top of iCloud (you have no choice there, non app store apps cant use iCloud).  I wrote the desktop app first, submitted it, then wrote the iPad/iPhone app, and submitted them.  To my surprise the iOS apps got approved in 6 hours, the desktop app for the Mac app store sat in review status for a month.<p>I cant get into the details, but only after I bugged the app review team did they tell me that the Mac app (which is exactly the same as the iOS apps), would be declined even though the iOS app had been on sale for weeks and was approved in 6 hours.<p>They also said that they will be potentially pulling the iOS apps now that they realized their mistake.<p>Anyway, its a great idea to build for these platforms.  And this is the rub, because you never know what Apple is going to do, you tend to shortchange yourself, and reduce your investment of time and energy, because you dont know when your done if Apple will approve it.<p>As for iCloud Apple suggested I use a different cloud API.  I find that pretty shitty, and I had other apps planned for iCloud that I will not be building on top of their stuff at this point.<p>This kind of experience is not unique to me.  But seriously consider whether the distribution channel is worth the hassle.  Chances are its not and getting your app in google search results can be generally easy.<p>good luck.",1345283905

The French, for instance, will not only blame everything on the government (or people who have had success), but <i>expect</i> everything from it (find me a job, keep me healthy, save my company from bankruptcy, provide me with nice state-sponsored TV fiction championing the values of ""diversity"", etc.).

The linear algebra parts are entirely unnecessary (although interesting).<p>For example, suppose we're playing the iterated prisoner's dilemma. I pre-commit to a strategy: if you've defected in the last 5 games I will always defect, otherwise I will defect unless I haven't cooperated in the last 4 games. In this situation your optimal strategy is to always cooperate, even though I'm taking advantage of you. Punishing me won't change my strategy, I've pre-committed to it. The rational strategy, and the one evolution would eventually settle on, is to always cooperate with me.<p>I think the main thing that bothers me is how the result is characterized as ""theory of mind"" beating evolution. As if evolution couldn't stumble on such simple strategies, and pre-commitment had no cost or associated risk of going extinct.",1345283851
4400724,comment,4400324,4400645,5,0,smsm42,,,"Note that you are comparing a big chain store (Circuit City) with small business (a Turk). Most businesses in the US are small businesses, which behave differently than chain stores. And if you think that that the Turk wouldn't get back the price of his tea hundredfold when you buy that rug, then you're very naive :) It's just different styles of conducting business - in some cultures, the negotiations are supposed to be personal and simulate closeness and friendship (even if parties are hoping to cheat each other as much as possible), in some it is supposed to be businesslike and impersonal.<p>As for the Apple store, I had been a number of times in Apple store in San Jose, that's abut 15 minutes drive from main Apple campus. Almost each time I had the worst experience. I had to wait for a long time, workers kept redirecting me from one to another, and since the policy is that there are no lines in Apple stores, I had no idea when I am going to be served - I just had to aimlessly wander around the store and wait for the moment where some ""genius"" is ready to grace me with his attention. I had to explain what I need to multiple people, which for some reason didn't talk to each other, and I observed multiple store workers not busy with anything but somehow still unavailable to help me. I am totally unconvinced about that being the paragon of customer service.",1345283836

As we can see, for their practical use arrays and pointers can really be seen as the same thing. So again, except if you are optimizing a program where you can statically declare your arrays and access them a lot (i.e., you are doing matrix multiplication), the difference between arrays and pointers does not really matter.",1345281317

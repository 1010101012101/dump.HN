If one hundredth of the promises made in the last election's manifestos were implemented, India would be a very different place.<p>Publishing manifestos is an almost empty electoral ritual, beyond the above mentioned mild ""signaling"" effects. No one holds any party accountable for what their manifestos promise and by the time the next election comes around, everyone has forgotten what the manifesto said (and there will be a new manifesto!). As an example, any party that plans to curry favor with the Muslim populace would include a ""resist American imperialism"" theme in its manifesto (though my friends who are part of the ground campaign report that many muslims think that Barack <i>Hussein</i> Obama is muslim, so they are feeling friendly to the USA and so the ""anti American stance to please muslims"" plank is backfiring occasionally!)<p>Second, the Samajwadi Party is largely confined to the ""cow belt"" of India, which has the least educated populace in India. There is a national election coming up in the next few days and this is just posturing on Mr.Yadav's part to score points with his uneducated/ English unfriendly constituents (or so he thinks. Most people, even the desperately poor, would,given the chance, send their children to English Medium. computer friendly schools).<p>A large chunk of the bureaucracy functions in English (though ever larger chunks have moved to the local language over the years) and this causes English illiterate people some difficulty when they have to interact with the bureaucracy. This is the sentiment Mr Yadav is (faintly) trying to add to his vote bank, without pissing off the english using bureaucrats. And of course, there is always a bunch of hard core language chauvinists who hate every language but their own (This in a country with 20+ official languages and 2000+ dialects) The elections are likely to be very close this year and every bit helps. The smarter folks just ignore this kind of posturing and look at what the candidate/party <i>did</i> in the past(vs  what they said).<p>Think of an American politician in a  heavily republican evangelical constituency talk about how he'd enforce Christian Prayer in schools and work diligently overturn Roe vs Wade.  The American pol would have powerful interest groups watching and publicizing every deviation from their agendsa. In India nothing like that exists.To a much greater degree than in the USA, in India no one really cares about party manifestos anyway except in a very abstract sense. Elections are decided on local/current issues and alliances.<p>Believe you me, any action to make this a ground reality would cause a massive backlash, if not  outright rebellion. Indian governments are largely coalitions of disparate parties and there is no way Mr. Yadav will get the votes in parliament to implement this. (he is a very canny politician, he wouldn't even try!)<p>To repeat, It's just posturing.  Mr Yadav  was recently hauled over the coals by the Election Commission for  making vaguely threatening noises about a very honest and incorruptible District Magistrate in charge of overseeing the elections in his constituency and probably just wants a last minute burst of publicity to shift the focus elsewhere.<p>To conclude,  Computers aren't going anywhere. Neither is English education. This is all posturing!",1239537565

Here, the assumption is that people become teachers because they can't get hired anywhere else, and they're paid accordingly.""<p>At least in India, many people become teachers ""because they can't get hired anywhere else, and they're paid accordingly."" This is particularly true in Engineering/Science/Mathematics.<p>Most teachers have zero industry experience, have never worked as engineers, have never done any significant engineering/science etc etc   and do choose teaching because they couldn't hack in the industry. [except for a few really good teachers at say the IIT's - which have their share of terrible teachers -  but you could find  equivalent folks in say MIT].
As you said ""(& a couple saints that just don't want to work there, for any amount of money).""<p>So maybe you are talking of China/other parts of Asia?",1239536961

558354,comment,556230,556694,0,0,lukifer,,,"I don't mean to say that principles don't matter; they define your goals, not your methods. Design vs. implementation, as it were. You can go on as long you like about the kind of world you would like to live in, but the only thing that actually matters is what you can actually implement. (Not that personal principles aren't also important; I mean specifically on a large-scale, public policy level.)<p>I suppose I should clarify, in that I don't mean solely data, which is subject to interpretation, but rather using engineering principles instead of making decisions based on gut-felt, emotionally charged belief systems. In each of the cases I mentioned, I think that the ""principled"" and the smart thing are synonymous:<p>- Resource wars (and wars in general) often cost more than they benefit, particularly over the long-term. Burning oil to get more oil, resulting in diminishing the world's dwindling oil reserves even faster. Far more profitable to invest the peace dividend elsewhere.<p>- Data consistently shows that drug usage goes <i>down</i> with decriminalization and treatment programs. It'd be an interesting philosophical debate of society-vs-individual if prohibition resulted in lower use, but it simply doesn't. It's harmful, expensive, and counter-productive.<p>- The bailouts are admittedly more nebulous, but in short, we might have been better off if we had paid the cost of letting decrepit and irrelevant institutions fail. Paying their ransom may be the more practical choice right now, but we lose a large opportunity to clean our slate and reboot, even though the short-term cost might be high. (Okay, I confess, that one's 99% subjective opinion.) ;)<p>Anyway, my original point was that principles are guides, not universal constraints, and one can believe in both social justice and rugged individualism. At the end of the day, there are no answers, only trade-offs.",1239535739

""Your friend would not consider hiring me because of this ""<p>I don't know how exactly you define exceptional, but if you are indeed exceptional in the  sense of being in the top 5% (say) of developers in your chosen language, and assuming your language is not some forgotten relic from the 60's, then  you should be beating off employers every day.<p>If I wanted a game written in Java (for whatever reason) and John Carmack wanted to take the job but he knew only C/C++ (but was ok with learning java) I couldn't imagine turning him down because I have Joe Blow's cv showing 10 years experience in java. If you are really exceptional in your language, I doubt someone would turn you down just because you'll take a couple of weeks to pick up ruby.<p>Moving on, I wonder how came to the conclusion you are ""exceptional""? This isn't a mocking question. I am just curious because even though I am a good programmer (if I do say so myself), and I have improved a few quanta of magnitude in the last few years, I always find that there are many people much better than me,no matter what level of proficiency I attain.<p>Maybe I just don't work hard enough but I am very interested in knowing at what point one would classify <i>oneself</i> as exceptional (vs other people making that judgment).<p>What have you achieved in your language of choice that made you conclude this? Maybe you have some code out there we can look at?<p>""Your friend would not consider hiring me because of this too I'll bet -- yet I could probably build his site twice as fast as the best Ruby programmer.""<p>This doesn't compute. The best ruby programmer in the world (whoever he/she is) should be massively productive. What enables you to get a 100% boost as compared to him?<p>EDIT: On judging oneself exceptional. There is a local legend that goes like this.<p>Once upon a time, long ago, a prince told his father(the king) that he wanted to become a martial arts expert and  an exceptional warrior. So the king apprenticed the prince to the best martial artist in the kingdom. The master was a greet teacher and the prince was very talented and diligent, and he threw himself into the training. The king got regular reports from the teacher that the prince was steadily advancing in his proficiency.<p>A year later, the prince came home for a holiday and the king asked him how his training was going. he replied "" I've learned  a lot. I could take on a 100 opponents at a time  and win, easy"". The king said "" That isn't good enough. You need more training""<p>The next year the king asked the same question and the prince replied "" well I've learned a lot more and I've changed my estimate. 100 people may be a little tough but I can take on 50 and win"" and the king just shook his head sadly and asked him to train more.<p>Every year after that the king would ask the same question and the number of people the prince thought he could fight simultaneously kept coming down till after many years he replied ""I think I could handle one opponent, maybe, but if possible I'd rather fight a duel only when absolutely necessary, because you never now what the result will be. There is always the possibility that your opponent totally outmatches you.""<p>And the king replied "" Now your training is  complete"". (And by then the prince was indeed a deadly fighter, the best in the kingdom).<p>fwiw.",1239535262
558351,comment,557961,558309,0,0,AlisdairO,,,"Absolutely - SSDs make irrelevant a lot of the advantages that a denormalised storage model provides: denormalisation means fewer seeks but more data stored/read, which is often a good tradeoff for disks, but not for SSDs.  It should be noted that column-oriented architectures offer the ability to compress away a lot of the excess information (they're very friendly to RLE-based compression, for example, and vertica integrates awareness of the characteristics of that compression into the query optimiser).  Fundamentally, though, in a data warehouse you're still going to be talking about pretty vast quantities of data, and disks are going to hold an advantage  in price/performance for much longer than they will in the OLTP sector.<p>I don't mean to suggest that the author has no idea what he's talking about, more that he's set up a bit of a straw man.",1239535254

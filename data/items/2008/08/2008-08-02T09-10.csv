264914,comment,264808,264825,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>It'd be a crackhead's paradise -- find the nearest hotel, break two room windows in, and score a cool $600 worth of electronics in a few minutes. Score!</i><p>I think the hotels that would use this first would not be the motel in the drug district, but rather a high-rise in some city.  If you can break into a 10th story window, I guess you can have the Roomba.<p>Currently, theft of this variety doesn't appear to be a real problem; there is tons of expensive stuff in hotel rooms right now.  Video game systems, flat-screen TVs, mattresses, etc.  The Roomba would be easier to steal, but I doubt it would become a common occurrence.<p>Besides, in my imagined version of how this would work, the door to the room would be open while the Roomba is doing its thing, and the maid would probably hear the window breaking.  (There wouldn't be a Roomba in each room, the maid would just carry some when doing their cleaning, set them loose in a few rooms, wait for them to finish, repeat.)<p>Anyway, this just won't happen.  I should have just written that initially and saved the bits used to represent this reply ;)",1217670947
264913,comment,264808,264815,0,0,jrockway,,,"Why don't 99%+ of developers use emacs or vi?  Because they are too dumb to realize that their life can be improved.  I assume a similar principle applies here.<p>mattmaroon (see blog post above) appears to be unable to follow the instructions included with the Roomba, so he doesn't like his.  This is interesting because this is the same argument (""it's too hard"") you hear about other cool things, like emacs, vi, CL, etc.<p>Anyway, I like mine.  I start it when I shower and I emerge to have a clean apartment.  I have a small apartment, though.  Yes, it needs to be emptied every few days (and the cat hair removed from the brushes), but that takes all of 5 minutes -- much less time than vacuuming manually would have required.  (The reality is that when I didn't have a Roomba, I just never vacuumed.  Gross.)",1217670690

But they do have lots of security problems, mostly they come from trying to support lots of different formats, plugins, programming languages and hence acquiring every security flaw of each and every one of them used (see the vulnerability in pnglib for example) and their sand-boxing is currently very very poor.",1217669637

I'd rather kids (and adults for that matter) knew a little bit about taxes, law or how to calculate compound interest of their debt.<p>There are things about natural systems that affect us and things that are interesting, but identifying and classifying  plants outside of any context is not one of them.",1217669544
264903,comment,264542,264782,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Mostly plugins and shoddy code. But yeah, I wouldn't necessarily call it an 'inherent' problem, just a difficult one. I've often wondered if it were feasible to run every browser tab in a separate (fork()ed) and chrooted OS process as an unprivileged user. Browsers generally already run plugins in separate processes because they have a habit of crashing or deadlocking. What about distrusting major parts of the browser itself that way?",1217669318

If there are any serious studies out there about gender and code quality, I'd love to read them. While gender itself may well be irrelevant when it comes to programming aptitude, the way that a society treats girls and women (and the fact that it may be (is, for mine) different than the way it treats boys and men) could influence how many/which women go into the world of programming, which might in turn influence the quality of what they produce.<p>I can't remember ever meeting a female programmer that I didn't later come to respect for their skill. Anecdotal evidence isn't really useful, though.<p>edit: Good point. I guess that if a correlation may exist for women by this logic, it may well also exist for non-mainstream sexual orientations.",1217667688

So, since you have already read a number of books, I would say that practice is the most important thing for you now.<p>Also, in time, you will want to learn other programming languages to give you a more rounded experience of what is available both in terms of tools and also concepts which will help shape how you think about and solve problems in java. Ideally you would learn a number of very different languages. At the very least a functional language as this even help you a lot when you begin writing multithreaded programs in java (and also help you design simpler, more composable code).<p>But for now, practice. Try to set yourself real projects or actually useful tasks and make sure you complete them (ie don't have a load of unfinished projects, but finish them to the point that you could release them to non-programmers if you wanted).

5689201,comment,5677220,5686902,1,0,wpietri,,,"Yes, that's the fundamentalist libertarian perspective. Like most fundamentalisms, it is hermetically sealed: you can never convince a Freudian it isn't all about sex, or a bible thumper that it isn't all about God's word.<p>I always find that a little depressing with libertarianism, as there's enough useful material there that I hate to see fanatics turning people off to it. There's a giant difference between ""an important function of government is"" and ""government's sole duty is"". The latter is appealing to people looking for simple answers to complicated problems, but is actively off-putting to everybody else.<p>I understand you don't think you're an anarchist, and, for a different reason, I'd even agree. I think the step-over-the-dying school of libertarianism would turn out, in practice, to be indistinguishable from the sort of chaos that people who don't know any actual anarchists think when they say ""anarchy"". (The interesting sorts of anarchism, like what the anarcho-syndicalists were pursuing, depend upon a human moral sense. Which, bringing this back, include compassion for the ill.)<p>The reason things will fall apart lies in another gap in your thinking. Parents are the most obvious thing a child depends upon. But try telling a teacher or a grandparent or a cop or a social worker or a neighbor or an aunt that they don't matter, that they don't have an impact on the kids they deal with. It takes, as they say, a village. Or, if you'd like a richer society, a lot more than that. You'll of course wave that away as inconsistent with your chosen theoretical framework. But that you can't perceive the value in something doesn't prove that it's valueless. It only shows you haven't bothered to really understand it.",1368229804

5689188,comment,5688462,5689047,6,0,jules,,,"In this context, the mathematical dual of something is the consumer of the something. So ""tagged unions are the mathematical dual of structs"" means that a tagged union consumer is isomorphic to a struct.<p>If you have a tagged union consisting of the elements Foo(int), Bar(char) and Baz(int,string) then to consume such a thing you have to specify what to do with a Foo, what to do with a Bar and what to do with a Baz. You can specify this by giving a struct with a function that consumes Foos, a function that consumes Bars and a function that consumes Bazs. In ML syntax we have:<p><pre><code>    type Qux = Foo of int | Bar of char | Baz of int * string\n\n    type QuxDual = Consumer of (int -> result) *\n                               (char -> result) *\n                               (char * string -> result)\n</code></pre>\nNow if you have a QuxDual, you can consume a Qux by picking the appropriate function depending on what kind of Qux you get, and then calling that function on the data inside that Qux.<p>You can see that because of these `result` types duality is not particularly nice in languages based on functions. It's nicer in languages based on processes or continuations, because they have a direct notion of a consumer of something. A consumer of an int is an `int -> result` function but in languages based on processes we can directly take a process that takes an int as an input or a continuation C(int). So in those kind of languages we don't have extra result types hanging around.",1368229319

Being the most popular (and open source) kernel means that anyone looking to experiment or improve in this area will almost definitively go to Linux. Combine that with the fact that Linux has major corporate support, and many of those sponsors have an interest in the kernel being good, it is not surprising that Linux is doing well in this area.<p>However, this also means that the kernel is (in some ways) optimized for more server/super computer type stuff which prefers throughput over latency, at the expense of desktop/smartphone use, which prefers low latency over throughput.<p>Of course, in many cases there is an option between approaches (either at compile or run time). In the case of the scheduler however, they decided not to support multiple implementations in the mainline. This leaves us with the highly complicated implementation suitable for high end computer, and not the simpler Brain Fuck Scheduler (BFS) that shows minor improvements in desktop use.<p>Of course, using BFS is only a patch away, and several desktop distributions do use it.",1368229136

I mean, AltaVista - backed by DEC - spent a relative massive amount of money at the time on what seemed like an index of insurmountable scale.<p>Who could ever compete with Facebook? You'd have to spend billions to replicate what they do, just to get off the ground.<p>The reason you're wrong, is because paradigm shifts is what matters, not chasing the past. That's the opening that makes it possible to replace Google (not compete head-on with them). I don't care how well organized Google is, they're so large now, they will run into the same clumsy elephant problem that every other mega company in world history has.<p>The problem isn't that Google has no competition. You should not be trying to solve the problem Google solved in 1998. That is over, they're riding the benefits of a solution from 15 years ago, extrapolated forward and polished.<p>You never compete head on with the past, you're guaranteed to die that way. You chase the future and replace the past. Look for the inflection, and bury Google in the past accordingly.<p>Need a better example? Windows was feared as a practical god of wrath in technology circa 1997/98. Who could ever hire enough engineers to write the tens of millions of lines of code to compete with that? It was the omnipotent titan that could never be challenged. Want the Windows obituary? It reads as follows: it never was challenged, it was replaced by the future that looked nothing like Windows 95/XP/Vista/8/etc.<p>The future begins with a new - obvious in hindsight - solution to a massive problem. Typically this solution will start out simple in concept, but can scale massively. It is almost always extremely cheap to instigate (relative to the value long term). See: PageRank.<p>The future does not begin by going after a leviathan like Google and playing the game the way they do, and spending money like they do. It never works that way.

This may seem trivial, but it allows for functions to be added to a class or type which is out of your control.<p>For example, the function to convert a 'string' to a C-style zero terminated string is:<p>toStringz(string s).<p>calling the function as s.toStringz() has a much more natural feel, and allows for a much more modular approach than ""throw everything in the class"", since it can just simply be added on as a uniform function in another module (toStringz is a library feature on the concrete string type).

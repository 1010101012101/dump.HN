What if a business guy has a vision that both he and the hacker agree has a chance to improve peoples lives.  And on top of this vision he has the money to fund it.  What is the hacker's response? And how should the equity be divided?  <p>",1181799549

As screens approach the crispness of paper, those tricks will become pointless distortions. In a roughly similar way, fonts designed to come through clearly in faxes tend to look dumbed-down in print.<p>There's another issue here which I haven't seen mentioned -- OS X assumes, by default, that displays have a gamma of 1.8, while 2.2 is traditional on Windows. For everyday non-graphics work, the difference is lost in the varition between monitors, but it will tend to make Windows antialiasing look slightly too heavy on Macs and vice-versa. (Once I noticed it, it was easy to spot screenshots of ClearType on my Mac LCD -- it's too colorful and ""sparkly"" compared to the system antialiasing.) If Apple didn't account for this, it may add to the confusion.",1181798046

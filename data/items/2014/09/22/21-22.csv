(I don&#x27;t think the particular fact that they invest in derivatives has anything to do with it.) For hedge funds any fees they accrue for &quot;performance&quot; are carried interest and not subject to regular income tax, though they will eventually be taxed at the capital gains rate.  E.g., if a hedge fund charges 2% of assets annually, plus 20% of annual increases in asset value over 8%, the 2% fee would be taxed as regular income and the performance part (20% of increases > 8%) would accrue to them as carried interest, treated as capital gains.<p>You can read more about this at Wikipedia:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carried_interest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carried_interest</a><p>My not-so-informed belief is that while there may originally have been a decent rationale for treating hedge fund performance fees as carried interest, in many (most?) modern hedge fund scenarios that categorization is misapplied.  In any case, the treatment as carried interest is legal, at least for now.",1411422730

8352819,comment,8351981,8352769,10,0,paf31,,,"Consider a recursive function like factorial:<p><pre><code>  fact :: Number -> Number\n  fact 0 = 1\n  fact n = n * fact (n - 1)\n</code></pre>\nThis will build stack frames and fail with a stack overflow for large inputs. We can fix this by using tail recursion and an accumulator:<p><pre><code>  fact :: Number -> Number\n  fact = go 1\n    where\n    go acc 0 = acc\n    go acc n = go (acc * n) (n - 1)\n</code></pre>\nThe PureScript compiler will recognize that every recursive call is in tail position, and will convert the function to a while loop.<p>If we want to perform side-effects during the recursion, we typically use a monad to track the type of side effect in use. For example, we can use PureScript&#x27;s Eff monad to trace information to the console:<p><pre><code>  fact :: Number -> Eff (trace :: Trace) Number\n  fact = go 1\n    where\n    go acc 0 = do\n      trace &quot;Done!&quot;\n      return acc\n    go acc n = do\n      trace &quot;Keep going ...&quot;\n      go (acc * n) (n - 1)\n</code></pre>\nIn the case of the Eff monad, the PureScript compiler employs some special tricks in the optimizer to enable the tail call optimization, so we&#x27;re still OK. But this is only possible because Eff is defined in the standard library (at least until we implement custom rewrite rules).<p>In the general case, the compiler only sees applications to the monadic bind function of the underlying monad. For example, if we use the Writer monad instead:<p><pre><code>  fact :: Number -> Writer String Number\n  fact = go 1\n    where\n    go acc 0 = do\n      tell &quot;Done!&quot;\n      return acc\n    go acc n = do\n      tell &quot;Keep going ...&quot;\n      go (acc * n) (n - 1)\n  </code></pre>\nwhich is equivalent after desugaring to the following code:<p><pre><code>  fact :: Number -> Writer String Number\n  fact = go 1\n    where\n    go acc 0 = tell &quot;Done!&quot; >>= \\_ -> return acc\n    go acc n = tell &quot;Keep going ...&quot; >>= \\_ -> go (acc * n) (n - 1)\n</code></pre>\nThis is an example of &quot;monadic recursion&quot; - a recursive function whose return type uses some monad. In this case, the recursive calls are no longer in tail position, so the compiler cannot apply the tail call optimization. The result is that the compiled JavaScript might blow the stack for large inputs.<p>The point is that idiomatic Haskell code is often not appropriate in JavaScript because of the different semantics, so it might not be appropriate in PureScript either. The good news is that many Haskell idioms have corresponding PureScript idioms (often using the Eff monad).",1411422203

Physical activity in general is helpful, but martial arts in particular has a very calming effect.

There is a big emphasis on overcoming your limits, and this has a very positive effect on self-esteem.<p>It also teaches you how to look inward at your own flaws. In martial arts, if you can&#x27;t do a technique, there are no teammates to blame. It&#x27;s on you to persevere and keep trying until you get it right. But you don&#x27;t want to hurt your training partner, so you have to stay calm and focused no matter how frustrating it gets. And when you do get it, it feels amazing. That confidence and calmness carries over into other areas of your life, and you feel like a million bucks.<p>A few other students in my class told me that it had a similar effect on them.

However, judged by this metric, the S&P 400 midcap index has historically outperformed the S&P 500 index, which has in turn historically had higher total returns than a balanced portfolio of index funds and bonds.  Be careful about any analysis that when applied to these investment options would conclude that someone in their 50s should hold all of their money in an S&P 400 index fund instead of having a better diversified portfolio.<p>Many hedge funds aim to have better risk-adjusted returns by some metric (say, Sortino ratio or Sharpe ratio) than the major stock indexes or other asset class benchmarks, or the traditional advice of a balanced portfolio of equity index funds and bonds.  They often consciously sacrifice some expected returns in exchange for reduced downside volatility.<p>Some hedge funds try to provide as good returns as possible while having as low correlation as possible to the major asset classes available outside the fund (equities, bonds, commodities, real estate, etc.).  These sorts of funds expect their investors to have major holdings in equities, bonds, commodities, real estate, etc. outside the fund.  These sorts of funds view themselves as an extra option for diversification for individuals who are already well diversified in the major asset classes.<p>Some funds (mostly short-only funds) aim to be anti-correlated to some asset class (typically equities) as cheaply as possible, so that holdings in the asset class combined with holdings in the fund result in better risk-adjusted returns (say, Sortino ratio or Sharpe ratio) than just holding major index funds along with some out-of-the-money long-dated puts on those indexes.  Many of these sorts of funds expect to have several years of small losses, punctuated by large gains in years when their investors&#x27; other holdings have major losses.<p>In short, I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of just plain poor funds out there.  However, depending on the investor&#x27;s utility function and holdings outside of the hedge fund, it may be rational for the investor to have holdings in a hedge fund even if that fund consistently under-performs the S&P 500 and MSCI World Index.",1411421299

At minute 42:26 of his talk, he even presents a complete picture of tranducers type. They are reducer transformers where a reducer is rather made of  3 pieces :<p><pre><code>   data Reducer a r s = Reducer {\n      init :: () -> r,\n      step :: r -> a -> r,\n      complete :: r -> s\n   }\n</code></pre>\nWe may than write :<p><pre><code>   type Transducer a b = (Reducer a r s) -> (Reducer b r s)\n</code></pre>\nBut I think that we miss the point doing that. A transducer should be able to lead to a new reducer which use a <i>different</i> type to accumulate inputs. This opens the way to state management and the implementation of transducer like `taking` or `partition`.<p>Leaving Haskell for OCaml I&#x27;m more comfortable with :<p><pre><code>   type (&#x27;a, &#x27;b, &#x27;c) red = {\n      init : unit -> &#x27;b;\n      step : &#x27;b -> &#x27;a -> &#x27;b;\n      comp : &#x27;b -> &#x27;c;\n   }\n\n   let taking n reducer =\n     let init () = (0,reducer.init ()) in\n     let step (i,acc) item = if (i<n) then (i+1,reducer.step acc item) else (n,acc) in\n     let comp (i,acc) = reducer.comp acc in\n    {\n       init = init;\n       step = step;\n       comp = comp\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe type of taking is `int -> (&#x27;a, &#x27;b, &#x27;c) red -> (&#x27;a, int * &#x27;b, &#x27;c) red`. The former `b` accumulator state has been replaced by a pair `(int,b)` where a counter is used to track how much items have been taken so far. Yes this should be improved with early termination. But the key point I want to highlight is that wrapping <i>all</i> the transducers into a single general type may imply the use of some sort of existential type (to abstract away the accumulation type). This general type is furthermore useless for the system to check the compatibility of a reducers along a transducer chain.<p>---<p>Another point I would like to say is that if transducers are undoubtedly an important and effective mean to build efficient transformation chains,\nthey doesn&#x27;t deserve to be pushed forward of conventional transformers (map, filter, take, ...) to which we are used for long.<p>Based on collection definition as something whose content is reducible, we can define the &#x27;map&#x27; collection transformation on the basis of &#x27;mapping&#x27; reducer transformation<p><pre><code>  type &#x27;a col = {\n    fold: &#x27;b &#x27;c. (&#x27;a, &#x27;b, &#x27;c) red -> &#x27;c\n  }\n   \n  let map f col =\n  {\n    fold = fun reducer ->  col.fold (mapping f reducer)\n  }\n</code></pre>\nSo, we have the clarity of map/filter/reduce with the power of transducers.<p><a href=""https://github.com/didier-wenzek/odist"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/didier-wenzek/odist</a>\nis a project where I started to implement these ideas some months ago.\nThis transducer discussion will undoubtedly energize me to work again on the topic !",1411420221

My guess would be that it&#x27;s going to roll out a streaming service, but on its own terms. This probably means renegotiating a lot of the music rights previously negotiated by Beats, and starting with a clean slate. Apple probably figures it can get better terms from the labels than Beats did.<p>Part of me thinks that the only reason a la carte purchasing still exists is because there is no way to get everything from one streaming service. To use a TV example: I can&#x27;t get most HBO shows on Netflix; ergo, I use Netflix and HBO Go. Same thing with Showtime, so I use Showtime&#x27;s app as well. And some things I can&#x27;t get anywhere through a streaming service, so I buy them. I&#x27;m not buying a la carte because I feel the need to &quot;own&quot; things. I&#x27;m buying a la carte because the fragmented streaming landscape has significant gaps in its coverage. What I&#x27;m really doing, when I buy, is covering those gaps <i>and/or</i> hedging against the risk that something I love might go away on my streaming services.<p>My wild hunch is that Apple realizes as much, and it&#x27;s moving to get as much content as possible under new license before it reveals its streaming service. It knows that a streaming service, in 2014 or 2015, needs to be as selection-complete as humanly possible. And anything not on its streaming service needs to be for sale on iTunes. It&#x27;s very hard to thread that needle when you&#x27;re working with legacy licenses under two different entities, presumably applicable only to those individual services.",1411419720

However, I just tried the same javascript snippet in the Chrome console and it takes 179ms instead. As I said, it's a matter of optimization that is happening with the interpreter (Chrome doesn't run javascript the same way Firefox does, as not every php version will interpret php code the same way based on different versions and compile options)<p>Edit : Think about that : web browser are always on the cutting edge of javascript performance with the ton of javascript libraries that keep popping out each day. Everytime a new browser comes out, tons of bloggers test the javascript speed of those browsers so there is a lot of work going into optimizing javascript to make it as lightning-fast as possible.<p>On the other hand, PHP hasn't been pushed like that towards compile-time optimization so that's why Javascript can sometimes beat PHP in terms of speed tests.",1300294716

On the other hand I would not consider dealing with a dev who's ready to work completely for free. Based on my past experience such devs are either seriously underqualified (and through that unreliable and require lots of mentoring and hand-holding) or they would gear down and slack if the project is not truly interesting for them.

We're not purely innocent victims in all this, San Francisco has done plenty to earn that magnet status.  Every now and then a mayors of some other city starts a kerfuffle by offering homeless people $50 and a one way bus ticket to SF (though SF actually used to bus its own over to Oakland).<p>I think a very well implemented national health care program can be a competitive advantage.

For the messages to be receivable, we must know the properties of the medium that the messages are to be sent on.<p>Basically, this limits the very earliest that such backwards going messages can be received to around now-ish.[1]<p>As a consequence it may not be a paradox anymore, since there will be no point at which we can operate without a suspicion of future interference, thereby reducing the paradox effect, and in fact encouraging it by divining the outcomes of our actions. Of course this divining rapidly loses power anyway, as multiple messages are sent conflicting with one another - it gets messy quick. It gets messier quicker if you choose to go with a ""many worlds"" interpretation of the universe.  Further, there are questions regarding observation: does observing a message from the future cement that future into being, possibly incurring an absurd chain of events but not causing any paradox (the 12 monkeys thing)?<p>What I am really driving at here is this: Your paradox claims are amusingly simplistic, the real deal here is that we just don't know enough to say.<p>[1] I am ignoring two big possibilities: 1. that this has been known for some time by, say, evil wall street bankers with secret labs (and their ilk -- governments, supervillians and such). 2. That there aren't aliens at some point in the very distant past whom we get messages to, and convince to do our bidding, who show up at various key stages of history an change everything.

I've talked with firms and business owners and they both seem to think it's a great idea.<p>That being said, I'm not a great developer.  I don't know much PHP or any other language really to build a full scale app like the one I have in mind.  I need a developer, or a couple to help bring this to life.

Here's how I think they do it:<p><pre><code>    1) Give generic information away for free (e.g. Reuters stories).\n    2) Place any unique, WSJ-only content, behind a pay-wall.\n</code></pre>\nMost content on newspaper websites fall into #1. When you see a link for ""all 584 news articles"" on Google News for a story, that information is pure commodity. You won't be able to charge for it.<p>The #2 category is where the money's at, but only if the information is worth something to those buying it. For the WSJ, you have extremely wealthy business people needing detailed info about the economy, and the WSJ is the only place that delivers it. Their pay-wall easily succeeds; high demand for a scarce piece of information, coupled with disposable income to buy it.<p>How does the WSJ get #2 content? Intimate relationships with corporate executives who don't have all day to talk to dozens of news outlets. Investigative reporting focused on business. Creating unique niche stories which you can't find anywhere else. For example, check out ""Off Screen, Porn Sites Trick Advertisers"", a pay-wall article:<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704893604576200383793893712.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405274870489360457620...</a><p>Now search for the story on Google News. 22 hits, none of them relevant, except for the same WSJ article above! The story isn't anywhere else because the WSJ created it. If you're in the online porn business, you're probably signing up for a paid account right about now.<p>WSJ HACK: If you click on the link in the Google News search results, you'll get free access to the whole article! :) It's the same URL as above, but WSJ.com knows you're coming from Google, and gives you free access. They likely do this for marketing/promotional reasons, and non-tech-savy users won't usually be aware of it.<p>--------------------<p>The issue with the NYT.com is, while they do create unique content, it's not typically the type of content people want to buy. What's more important to you, a story about a competitor for your business dollars, or an article about which wine tastes best? Are you selling aspirin or vitamins? Aspirin cures pain right now, where vitamins makes you feel a little bit better about your future self.<p>A few years ago the NYT put their Op-Ed pieces behind a pay-wall, but eventually realized it didn't work:<p><i>The paper has tried a pay wall before. In 2005, it rolled out “Times Select” whereby it cordoned off access to op-ed columnists like Thomas Friedman and to archived stories and other features. That strategy generated around $10 million a year. But it was considered a failed experiment, and the Times dropped the wall in September 2007.</i> - <a href=""http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20100120/the-new-york-times-officially-starts-construction-on-its-paywall-metered-model-coming-2011/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20100120/the-new-york-times-...</a><p>Op-Ed is arguably their most unique content, but it wasn't really valuable for their readers. To charge for content, they need unique information that isn't available anywhere else, which is also valuable enough for their customers to pay for. Op-Ed pieces met the first criteria, but not the second.<p>Perhaps their best way to charge for stuff is to augment it. Shoot a video for every free article, placing it behind a pay-wall. Some people like to watch instead of read. Have a pay-walled ""additional details"" section, outlining some additional facts not covered in the free article. Subscribers could be the only ones allowed to talk to reporters directly, asking them questions and getting feedback. Stories appear 4 hours earlier for subscribers. I'm brainstorming here (lots of crap, I know).<p>They're in a tough situation. I think most newspapers have realized that the 40-50% margins from twenty years ago are gone for good. It may be that most of the industry, outside of a niche few, are going to get stuck with much tinier margins indefinitely.",1300291251
2332543,comment,2332071,2332071,0,0,bartonfink,,,"Personally, I prefer to learn a system by working on it instead of studying it from the outside. Bugs, except the most trivial ones, are great for this because you have to walk through the system to sort out cause from effect and you can't help but learn as you do that. If you don't have bugs, you can get some mileage out of utilities you've always wanted but haven't had time to write (maybe you want your code to use a new function to generate a standard window title). The key there is not just doing the discrete work (the function), but the weaving it into existing code.<p>However, occasionally I'll run into a ? that I can't answer myself directly from the code I see (a good example would be a message queue where I only have access to the producer or consumer). For that, I either need some external resource, whether it's someone to ask ?'s of, or documentation to read or even a fair amount of time to see the whole system working together.<p>Probably the least effective method I've run into is having someone try to walk me through a system. Very few people are able to explain a system from soup to nuts without taking their own knowledge base for granted. If you do decide to do this, the best method I've found is to treat the explanation as a series of problem/solution pairs. Keep reframing the discussion in terms of a conceptual problem, and then point the code that solves that problem. You can drill down as needed, and the constant reframing gives enough breadcrumbs that it's easy for an outsider to follow.",1300291250

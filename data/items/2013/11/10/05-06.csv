First, you pick a point of reference and call that not moving, then everything else is moving in reference to that. There is no point in the universe that is not moving independent of choosing a point of reference.<p>This is actually related to Galileo. What he said is irrelevant. What he did was pick a point of reference without a reason, the sun, and that was of course immediately denied by both the church and all science to this day.<p>Speaking practically, when calculating satellite orbits one uses a two body universe, Earth and Moon. To include the Sun, other planets, the Milky Way or distant galaxies would be inefficient and not yield a result different enough to bother. So many people legitimately treat the Earth as the center of the universe every day and to do otherwise would be inappropriate.<p>Science of course, pretty much since G went out on a limb, says that planets don&#x27;t orbit.

He taught public policy and one day explained that black businesses in Kenya were uncompetitive against Indian-run enterprises since blacks where too generous in granting credit to friends and family. He had been invited by the government of Kenya to study the situation and suggested better business training for black Kenyans. The topic was indisputably part of the course and thus totally protected by AAUP academic speech guidelines. Stuart was also extremely liberal on all racial issues.<p>Nevertheless, to condense a long story, an anonymous letter from irritated black students complained of Nagel&#x27;s &quot;racism&quot; and included the preposterous change of &quot;workplace violence.&quot; After a protracted and bungled internal university investigation, two federal trials (I testified at one), he was stripped of his teaching responsibilities and coerced into retirement. Interestingly, having been charged as &quot;racist,&quot; his departmental colleagues, save two conservatives, abandoned him. A few years later, partially as a result of this emotionally and financially draining incident ($100,000 out-of-pocket for legal fees), he committed suicide. I can only speculate that he believed that years spent being a &quot;good liberal&quot; (including service in the Justice Department&#x27;s Civil Rights Division) would insulate him from being denounced as a &quot;racist.&quot; Nor would he have anticipated that the university would spend the hundreds of thousands in legal fees to punish a famous tenured faculty member who &quot;offended&quot; two students. Nagel&#x27;s sad saga undoubtedly provided useful lessons to many others. Stupidity can really be dangerous, even in a university. Better keep quiet.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/09/since-some-people-seem-to-still-think.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/09/since-s...</a>",1384061966

Bridging the gap between real estate professionals and their clients. Real estate is the largest industry in the world. Its also one of the most importantafter all, everyone needs a place to live. Millions of consumers are looking for their next home online, and they expect the same kind of browsing and buying experience they get on sites like Amazon and Facebook. Unfortunately, real estate agents are struggling to provide that experience. Thats where Placester comes in. Were creating an industry where it&#x27;s quick and simple for real estate professionals to get their information on the web. Dont let that simple description fool you. Were addressing the hardest problem in the largest industry in the world. As you might have guessed, not everything is written on the home page yet.<p>Our Culture: Team. Join the team that makes a difference in a big, complex industry. Our culture is all about teamwork. That being said, we&#x27;re composed of folks who are their own brand of brilliant, focused, fun, intense, and friendly. If you&#x27;ve ever worked on a high performing team you&#x27;ve experienced this mix before. Youll be expected to get things done and be responsible for making it happen, without any bureaucratical mess. Youll be expected to identify problems and solve them on your own. But more importantly, you may need to rally a friend or team to overcome them. Both are key tools on your belt. Youll be expected to have an opinion because it will matter when shaping the outcome of your company.<p>Opinions are about courage: to speak your mind and to change it. Everyone laughs a lot over lunch. Topics range from the standard technical, tactical and whos-doing-what in the start up world; but they also weave through topics like the proper structure for the US debt, that great restaurant down the street or how to Sous-vide the perfect piece of meat.

Young people with &#x27;healthy&#x27; kidneys are able to eat and drink almost anything they want and are much more likely to have well-regulated blood pressure. However, as we age, our kidneys perform more poorly (a simple explanation as to why older people are more likely to take blood pressure medications than younger people). As our physiology weakens, our diet (and exercise, among other things) become more important to our physiological health. This, in conjunction with the hardening of our arteries due to age and atherosclerosis, means that our diet (particularly our sodium intake) becomes exponentially more important in our older age than our younger age.<p>If this sounds unlikely, understand that the kidney is the direct or indirect target of many medications for blood pressure. Diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide and loop diuretics such as furosemide act very directly on the kidney. Drugs such as ACE inhibitors (e.g. lisinopril), ARBs (e.g. losaratan), and renin inhibitors (aliskiren) act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which directly involves the kidneys in a different manner.

Now it is a well known fact that no matter how many right hand side variables you include, the coefficient on BLACK will always be significant and positive.  That is, even after accounting for income, education, etc., Black people commit more crime.<p>Now we are allowed to say this in class, because it is already understood that by getting this far into a PhD, you have proven yourself not to be an evil racist.  For example, everyone <i>knows</i> that the positive coefficient on BLACK must be a result of complex social interactions and not genetics.<p>But ordinary people aren&#x27;t so sophisticated, so they are not allowed to even know that the coefficient on BLACK is significant.

People who consider themselves sensitive to MSG are encouraged to confirm this through an appropriate clinical assessment.\nStandard 1.2.4 of the Australia and New Zealand Food Standards Code requires the presence of MSG as a food additive to be labeled in packaged foods. The label must bear the food additive class name (e.g., flavour enhancer), followed by either the name of the food additive, MSG or its International Numbering System (INS) number, 621.[30]&quot;<p>In NZ - no one cares<p>In Aus - everyones like &quot;ZOMG MSG, BAD FOR YOU&quot; and try to avoid it.<p>Food in NZ is way better than Australia.

6705340,comment,6701688,6701688,2,0,colanderman,,,"I can&#x27;t find any documentation on the type system.  In particular, I&#x27;m interested in how objects are typed (that they&#x27;re both structurally typed and may be abstract is novel), and the capability of the type refinements.<p>I loathe template-based OO due to the possibility of monkey-patching but the fact that objects are immutable looks like it might ease this.  (Generating efficient code might still be difficult.)<p>I don&#x27;t see the use cases for the cyclic structure as presented.  If your data at all resembles a database relation, then (a) you have scalar keys anyway so you don&#x27;t need language support, and (b) you probably need to key off of more than one column.<p>The &quot;method-as-fun&quot; semantics seem weird.  Given this code:<p><pre><code>    o = { x(self): self.y end, y: 10 }\n    f = o.x\n</code></pre>\nf() returns 10, as per the examples on the front page.  But then:<p><pre><code>    p = o.{y: 15}\n    q = { x: o.x, y: 15 }\n</code></pre>\nClearly p.x() should return 15, but what does q.x() return?  It doesn&#x27;t seem clear whether it should return 10 or 15.  (Without reading through the reference manual (it&#x27;s late), my guess would be that method definition is special-cased, so that the answer would be 10.)",1384060625

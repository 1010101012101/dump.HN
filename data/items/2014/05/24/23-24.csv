If either buyer or seller defects (or there&#x27;s some kind of a problem), there&#x27;ll be <=1 signature present. The third mediating/escrow party would then choose whether to place their own signature or not (thereby validating or nullifying the transaction, accordingly.)<p>iirc there&#x27;s also some BIP-level stuff (or an idea to implement it using bitcoin Script, anyway) to have things like NashX[1] work within bitcoin. Basically a Nash equilibrium based transaction scheme with no human &#x27;escrow&#x27; party required - everything is formalized. If either the buyer or the seller fails (i.e.: if any of the two report &#x27;failure&#x27;), all funds are burnt (e.g. sent to some provably bogus bitcoin address, whatnot.) <i>Both</i> parties have to chime in so that the risk is distributed accordingly/appropriately.

First, this probably isn&#x27;t true and, second, it&#x27;s not what&#x27;s really important here.<p>How many parts inside these drones are off-the-shelf parts manufactured in China?  Of the parts that aren&#x27;t off-the-shelf, how many can be reproduced exactly just by sending a design files and a check to the right place?  How much of the software do they now have binaries for? Iran could probably produce a drone configured to run on the U.S. TDRSS system fairly quickly.  All they&#x27;d have to do is reproduce the drone that crashed exactly.  Unfortunately, this wouldn&#x27;t do them a whole lot of good.  The big problem is probably going to be to reverse engineer and adapt the drone&#x27;s software/hardware so they can be used with Iranian systems, which probably don&#x27;t exactly have <i>global</i> coverage. It&#x27;s another challenge still to learn enough from this design for Iran to be able to produce different designs.  Copying is a great way to learn though.<p>The drone&#x27;s stealth tech may be compromised for a variety of reasons, such as the difficulty of reproducing paint coatings, etc..  This brings us to what is really important.  This same stealth tech was already compromised by the Chinese radar installations Iran used to detect and hijack the drone in the first place. Iran is already using Chinese radar systems and is probably not working alone. The opportunity to reverse engineer the latest stealth drone hardware is going to make China (or perhaps Russia) <i>very</i> generous to Iran.<p>Chinese radar systems can already penetrate the latest U.S. stealth tech given the right circumstances, but now they are likely to get even more effective.  Stealth requires such huge compromises from aircraft designs that I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if stealth designs are soon abandoned.  This incident is not the beginning of the end for Stealth aircraft, it&#x27;s closer to the end of the end!",1400975652

It&#x27;s also not possible to limit the use of the equipment beyond its stress limits without using money. Trains in particular require additional staff to handle high passenger loads. Some passenger trains are not set up to handle high traffic loads. Charging money limits the ridership to the people who want/need to use the train more than others. It also limits ridership of likely bad actors who will do things like key the windows or spray graffiti in the tunnels or on the trains themselves.<p>>Why would city spend significant resources to discourage usage of public transport?<p>Because then they would otherwise need to rely entirely upon the political process to maintain needed funding to the system, and there would be other spill-over impacts to the quality of the rail network.<p>>Do they really prefer for the people to buy cars and stand in traffic for hours on overcrowded streets and subsequently be disgruntled and pressure local governments for more roads?<p>I&#x27;m unfamiliar with road policy in Sweden. I imagine that the fares are paid through taxes on gasoline, tickets for driving violations, licensing fees for commercial vehicles, and other fees. The two transportation methods are not completely interchangeable. You can&#x27;t run heavy freight on a passenger rail line. It&#x27;s a bit easier to have shared freight and passenger traffic a highway. Expanding rail coverage to other regions is much more capital intensive than expanding road coverage, and much more challenging to estimate (see: the underutilized light rail projects all over the United States).<p>In a magical world of infinite resources and immortal human beings and infinite time, then there would be no reason to charge fees on anything. Because we live in a finite world of finite time and resources, we use money as a measurement tool to make better decisions with how we allocate our resources.<p>>Why only public traffic commuters pay if all benefit from the fact that they are not on the street crawling in 1.5 tonne of steel each?<p>Not all benefit at all times to the same degree.

7794798,comment,7794529,7794529,5,0,djokkataja,,,"I switched from Gmail to Fastmail about a year ago after using exclusively Gmail for email since 2007. I&#x27;ve been very happy with Fastmail since then. Primarily I was bothered by getting the service for &quot;free&quot; from Google--it&#x27;s not free for them to provide it (no such thing as a free lunch), which means they have to find ways to monetize my personal communications with others without me directly paying them. Obviously there are the ads, but then there&#x27;s the matter of having to stay up to date on their privacy policies... long story short, Google creeps me out a little, and I&#x27;d rather pay a bit of money to feel like I&#x27;m not a host for some kind of sprawling global parasite.<p>Anyway, pros:<p>- The Fastmail web interface is <i>fast</i>. I&#x27;ve never seen it take longer to load than 1 second on any computer or internet connection; it&#x27;s noticeably faster to load up the entire interface than Gmail.<p>- Fastmail also uses basically the same keyboard shortcuts as Gmail (j/k to go up and down, x to select, # to delete, y to archive, z to undo, r to reply, f to forward, a to reply-all, ctrl-enter to send--works from any field in fastmail rather than just the body or title as in gmail, which is handy for forwarding things).<p>- Sometimes sending/opening messages in Gmail was kind of slow; sending messages from Fastmail has always been virtually instantaneous, and opening them is definitely instantaneous. I think Fastmail preloads email content into the client so that it only has to request images from the server, because it definitely opens email too quickly to have done a round trip to the server to get the email contents. If you press &#x27;o&#x27; to open an email, it will be open by the time your &#x27;o&#x27; key comes back up.<p>- Fastmail can help with setting up DNS for emails for custom domains.<p>- Fastmail has this &quot;Pin&quot; feature that lets you pin emails so that they stick to the top of whatever folder they&#x27;re in. I always wanted something like this in Gmail (like if starred messages stuck to the top or something). I think there&#x27;s an option to toggle whether or not they float to the top if you&#x27;re not a fan. Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure that having this feature has actually been beneficial to me in any way, but I like it a lot.<p>Cons:<p>- The Fastmail interface is not as pretty as the Gmail interface. There is no option to get a big, beautiful background picture, and the interface doesn&#x27;t really have space for it anyway. This bothered me a little at first, but these days I don&#x27;t care... if I&#x27;m gazing longingly at the mountains in the background picture of my email, I&#x27;m being extraordinarily unproductive.<p>- Fastmail&#x27;s auto-complete when you&#x27;re typing in the recipient list does not keep track of who you send to most frequently and push them automatically to the top of the list. This still bothers me sometimes.<p>- Fastmail&#x27;s settings pages are a little confusing. There are a couple different ways to get to them, and it can be a little tricky to figure out where you&#x27;re supposed to find something. I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the way settings are organized in any email client, though... Gmail and Outlook have settings pages that aren&#x27;t as terrible these days; Fastmail&#x27;s settings are a little less refined. On the other hand, it seems like you can do a lot more with the settings in Fastmail (so this is a bit of a pro, not strictly a con).<p>- Fastmail has a folder system with nesting like Outlook. I don&#x27;t think this is really a bad thing; I like the concept of Gmail&#x27;s labels a lot, but I never found it to be significantly more useful than folders. What sucks about Fastmail&#x27;s implementation is that to create folders or rearrange them, you have to enter this special folder management menu. Then to create a folder, you have to scroll all the way to the bottom and type the new name, and if you want it to be at the top, then you have to drag it up past all of the other folders, and there seems to be a max speed on how quickly you can drag it up, and it starts arbitrarily selecting the text as you&#x27;re dragging and sometimes gets a little janky as you get to the top. Definitely my least favorite part of the interface.<p>Ambiguous:<p>- Not strictly a pro or a con in my opinion: there is no chat interface built-in (actually I&#x27;m not certain about that, there might be some option to enable chat and put in chat credentials, etc. but I haven&#x27;t looked for it). Overall I think this has been very good for getting me in and out of my inbox very quickly and productively without any risk of distraction. I actually stopped using any form of chat until more recently when I needed it for work, and I think my quality of life was improved for it, but I know that for many people chat is an important part of communicating. But I haven&#x27;t missed it in my webmail one bit.<p>Wow, that was a lot more than I expected to write! Anyway, to sum up, from my perspective as a web developer:<p>- Fastmail is faster and contributes better to getting things done, in my experience (worth the $60/yr for that reason alone)<p>- Fastmail has some nice options if you&#x27;re setting up email inboxes for yourself for custom domains. I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend it <i>yet</i> as a mail option for clients since it&#x27;s a little less polished than Gmail and some of the settings options are a good deal more technical.<p>- Fastmail is a nice gateway drug to freeing yourself from the idea that Gmail is the be-all-end-all of email. Still waiting for someone more productive than myself to combine webmail, Trello, and Google Calendar into a glorious productivity app that ushers in a new era for humanity.",1400974299

This is bad because it often causes whoever is writing the code to use an arbitrary length that &quot;will probably be big enough&quot;, and IMHO that is never a good thing, for various reasons including security.<p>Making it controlled by a simple, <i>fixed-length</i> (or length-delimited where absolutely required) binary protocol would&#x27;ve reduced or even eliminated many of these overflows, because such protocols are far easier to write correct code for. E.g., if a command is always 8 bytes, then you are always going to use a buffer of 8 bytes and read 8 bytes. Those that need variable-length data can prefix the data bytes with a length, and that must always be read first and acted on, since reading too much or too little just won&#x27;t work. No need to parse text lines of arbitrary length, (un)escaping, etc. Each additional layer of complexity, each step that needs to be done, is an opportunity for bugs to be introduced.<p>Also, this is a device that absolutely does not need to be running Linux; its functionality would probably be achievable with an 8-bit microcontroller and WiFi module, running none or maybe a minimal realtime OS. Instead of over 4MB of firmware, a few tens of K would be sufficient.

How do I signal that amount to others? Do I have more or less?). For small, whole quantities (<100), alternate numeral systems could likely reach a similar  learning curve as Arabic numerals. Very large and complex quantities, and things of a number theoretic nature are probably areas where a future numeral system will be differentiated.",1400973010

Chemical vapor deposition of high quality diamonds is well established and doesn&#x27;t cost much at all.<p>Market pricing for aesthetic applications of diamonds continues to be only loosely related to cost of production.

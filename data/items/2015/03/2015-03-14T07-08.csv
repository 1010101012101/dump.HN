You’d be taking on many essential responsibilities, but maybe ones that don’t need to get done by the founders themselves.<p>We&#x27;re looking for candidates who value mastering whatever it is they’re doing. You&#x27;ll need to be open to figuring things out on your own. This may mean spending some time researching the best way to accomplish things (e.g., finding a decent place to print business cards). It may also mean experimenting, which means that sometimes you might fail. (That&#x27;s okay.) Along with that, you&#x27;ll need the persistence to keep going and try again. While we don’t want you to stress out, you might think about this job as de-stressing the rest of the team.<p>We’re looking for someone who can communicate very clearly, who has a lot of patience, and knows how to get organized.<p>This position will be based out of our SoMa office in San Francisco.<p>Does that sound like you or someone you know?

9201876,comment,9201644,9201785,0,0,ffn,,,"Most people don&#x27;t view Stallman&#x27;s words as gospel, he&#x27;s actually kind of a running joke nowadays - a sort of the caricature of the software profession, all neckbeard, tin-foil, and wizard powers. And it is true a lot of Stallman&#x27;s ideas are sadly unrealistic for a large corporation operating in many highly complex environments.<p>And although nearly every single point on his rant regarding facebook&#x27;s policies is ridiculous as an argument against using facebook (except the psychology study one), I do absolutely agree with him that folks should, with enough time and introspection, grow out of using facebook personally (professional use is fine). The fact of the matter is facebook gives you the illusion of personal connection and being &quot;always in the know&quot; so you short-circuit that reward-loop in your brain and wind up with an addiction. It&#x27;s just like drugs, alcohol, video games, or any host of other addictive activities out there for us to waste our lives on.<p>Granted it&#x27;s fun at first, but after a while, one needs to realize one has become a slave to a rather meaningless habit (checking your feed, updating your status, &quot;liking&quot; shit) that doesn&#x27;t make you better, richer, or any more intimate with another. Instead, you&#x27;ve sat at your computer for another evening, poor-ifying the circulation in your legs, watching the highlights of other people living their lives, and feeling mildly displeased with yourself yet not enough to ever look away. Instead of facebook, you could&#x27;ve did leg day at the gym and gotten better glutes, hiked to the beach and communed with nature, joined a crossfit class and paid to irreparably hurt yourself, or even got some work done on your hobby project.<p>Facebook is literally wasting you away for the promise of social fulfillment that it can&#x27;t fulfill. After all when it comes to social connection, facebook is far inferior to actually meeting up for a date, direct call/skype, text/im/email... hell, in a lot of ways Facebook is worse than video games because, when you&#x27;re playing a video game with friends, at least you&#x27;re all working together on a common platform (especially if it&#x27;s one of those Kinect dancing games, nothing brings people closer than watching each other dance awkwardly). Instead, you&#x27;re on facebook, ruminating over ghosts of people and events that have already passed by you, thinking you&#x27;re together and connected with all your friends, yet still miserably yourself in front of your computer with nothing to show for it. Also, one can stand to look at only so many pics of receipts from super expensive restaurants by friends who have just recently gone and are gushing over the food like some 12 year old fangirl over a boyish pop idol.",1426319285

9201866,comment,9201644,9201799,0,0,lazaroclapp,,,"Privacy and freedom are different concepts, though. A world in which the government can monitor all of your phone calls, but it not allowed by law to stop them or prosecute you over their contents still preserves freedom very strongly, without any privacy (assuming the law constraining the government is enforceable, and extra judicial or spurious prosecutions are not a tool commonly available to the state). A world in which technology (or lack thereof) makes wiretapping impossible, gives a lot of privacy to people, but if you can still be arrested because of distributing a leaflet, it provides little freedom.<p>Thing is, even in a world where freedom of expression were inviolable (and it isn&#x27;t quite this world, so in reality, privacy helps support freedom of expression), we&#x27;d still want privacy to be a human right. Animals don&#x27;t behave the same when they know they are always being watched. Pervasive surveillance inhibits thought, breeds abuse and unnecessarily limits human behavior.<p>Also, in the end, we have the right to have things to hide. We have the right to say and do things we are ashamed of, or aren&#x27;t sure are right, or we are not ready to defend under scrutiny of society at large. We have the right to share thoughts with others that we are not ready to defend from strangers, even if the law prevents such strangers from hurting us because our thoughts. Society needs to be able to discuss heresy, and revolution, and treason, because what for one generation is treason and heresy, for the next might be justice and freedom. But it also needs to be able to have some of those discussions in dark, private places, because a lot of great thoughts will only ever bloom in the dark. Even if mass surveillance worked (it doesn&#x27;t), even if abuse could be curtailed (it can&#x27;t), even if it gave us a world without crime (it won&#x27;t), the price to pay would be a world where our thoughts are constrained by the fear of other&#x27;s seeing them in their underdeveloped raw form.",1426318926

We have had similar problems in Finland: my local water utility had to flush some clean water straight to the sewage system, because people started saving water and sewage lines started to clog up.<p>You can get around this problem partially by designing the sewage system  to deal with this (handles better a larger portion of solid matter in the wastewater, includes pipelines for flushing fresh water through it).<p>Still, too much frugality is not a good thing. We nowadays use washing machines and dishwashers that are built to German specification.<p>The washing program is a compromise of water amount, temperature, duration, and mechanical wear during the wash. We now have machines where the water amount and temperature are prioritized. Thus the washing program takes a long time, and it puts a lot of mechanical wear to clothes.<p>This is OK for Germany, where water is somewhat scarce. You have one city pulling its water from the Rhine, purifying it, using it, and putting the managed wastewater back to the Rhine, then the next city a few kilometres downstream does the same, and then the next. The purification is an expensive process.<p>But we don&#x27;t have that; we have a pipe from a lake that contains already-drinkable water in abundance, and it needs just a bit of cleansing of solid matters before delivering to consumer pipes, and it is better than in Germany.  Then, after using this water, the wastewater needs to be managed, regardless of where the clean water came from<p>But now the bottom line is, we save water that we wouldn&#x27;t need to save, then we flush sewage pipes with fresh water, and when I put my clothes to my Miele, I wait for two hours to wash the cotton program, and wear out the clothes too soon because the washing machine rubs and whirls them half-dry.",1426318071

(AT&T started requiring that smartphones have a data package or be blocked entirely from data if the smartphone was already on the account.  This one already was so the block was put in place.  Six months later, AT&T declined to exempt MMS &quot;data&quot; from the data block, so the user&#x27;s picture and group messages died.  Tech support said I could put a $30 data feature on there to restore MMS.)<p>Now, for ~90% of the coverage I had with AT&T, I pay $179 and that&#x27;s with interest-free financing of my wife&#x27;s new mobile phone.  Once that is paid off in a year, the bill drops to $160.  That&#x27;s seven SIMs, or five mobile phones and two data-capable tablets, and now the smartphone user who couldn&#x27;t have MMS on AT&T has it, just like all five lines have 1GB of high speed data (going over is free, but rate-limited).<p>If I wanted to go cheaper, there&#x27;s Cricket Wireless, MetroPCS, Red Pocket Mobile, Harbor Mobile, Page Plus, or any number of MVNOs (mobile virtual network operators) and resellers that have popped up in the past year or so.

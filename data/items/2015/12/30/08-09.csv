Yes, you can make your servers redundant, and keep them up 24/7, or you can use the pay as you go model with the Blockchain. The difference is like keeping a car idling vs. using an electric car.<p>2.)  Writing things to the Blockchain can be very beneficial compared to your own database. Ownership of offline things like bikes can be done with a Bluetooth/NFC chip and a bitcoin address. Also for online  transactions, it provides a tamper-free source of truth.<p>3.) You argue that someone would still have to write the logic for the Blockchain apps. That&#x27;s definitely true but the impact of a Blockchain startup might replace a higher ratio of jobs than you expect.

10811308,comment,10803775,10811262,0,0,pron,,,"> Why Oracle didn&#x27;t sue Apache?<p>Simple: because they didn&#x27;t have the motivation (see point (I)). Their goal wasn&#x27;t to copyright APIs (that just was one of the many <i>tactics</i> used in court, and the one that just happened to win), but to get their share of Android. Suing Apache wouldn&#x27;t have helped their goal in the least.<p>Also, while not relevant to the question, I will note that even if APIs are copyrighted, Harmony has a <i>much</i> stronger fair-use defense than Android: 1. It was done for the purpose of interoperability and 2. it was not intended to make a profit. Each of these is a fair use defense alone, and certainly together, but neither is true for Android (although the first might be partially true).<p>> Sun didn&#x27;t sue Google in the 5 years Google used Android<p>Because they didn&#x27;t have the resources and the inclination, as the company was already in a downward spiral and such a lawsuit could only have hurt them at the time. Google, however, fully expected them to.<p>> The ruling talks about API and API&#x27;s has nothing to do with being a language level API or a &quot;web API&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s only because the term &quot;API&quot; -- until very recently -- was only used to describe language-level API, while what today is known as a web API has always been called a protocol, so don&#x27;t let the recent overloading of the term confuse you.<p>More to the point, the reason copyright may apply to APIs but certainly not to protocols is because copyright law is not only concerned with the intent, abstraction, or use of the work, but also with its form. This why other IP protections (like patents) exist, to cover works whose <i>form</i> does not match those covered by copyright.<p>In particular, copyright requires a fixed representation (in text, image, recording etc.). So, for example, if I tell you a story, the story isn&#x27;t copyrighted. But if I write it down -- or even record it -- then the <i>text</i> of the story or the <i>recording</i> is copyrighted. It doesn&#x27;t matter that the purpose in all three cases was the same: to convey a story (once that fixed form is copyrighted, the protection may extend to non-exact reproductions, but that original fixed-form <i>must</i> exist). While a protocol may be described in a text and that <i>text</i> is copyrighted, the described protocol itself cannot be, because it does not have a fixed representation in text (a completely different text could describe the same protocol). A language API does have a fixed form.<p>> the appeal court ruled that the fair use question must be decided in the forthcoming case, nothing more. As any other copyright case<p>Yes, but that was the point. Google made some arguments that they believed would make APIs non-copyrightable. The court ruled that those arguments are fair-use arguments which are not relevant to the question of copyrightability, but may be used as a defense once APIs are copyrighted.<p>> No, it has to go to court so yes, any player must be concerned<p>Quite the opposite. It is the copyright holder who has to sue you. Any company would sue you if they believe they have a case, and you would still need to defend yourself in court when they do. The question of API copyrightability had never been decided, so even before the ruling there was a good chance you&#x27;d be sued, and you&#x27;d still need to defend yourself. Now, it is true that a ruling against API copyrightability would have removed this threat (which had existed even prior to this case), but now your position is not much different than before, only that except making two arguments (as Google did) -- that API are not copyrightable <i>and</i> if they are, you&#x27;ve made fair use of them -- you only have one: fair use.",1451464305

I&#x27;m even doing a standard web project for a guy who thinks it will be useful to keep track of stuff in containers. I come from the finance industry, so I think I also know a bit about the requirements there, and they don&#x27;t need it.<p>So let&#x27;s look at what blockchain technology lets you do:<p>1) You get an indelible wall that grows every 10 minutes. You can write whatever you like on it. Well, that&#x27;s great but you can do that with a normal database. It&#x27;s well known how to do it, there&#x27;s backup processes, security, various consistency measures, scaling, and so on that are established.<p>2) You don&#x27;t need to run your own database. This is great if you don&#x27;t want the network to be closed due to malfunction or police intervention. But banks already know how to run a database, they have hordes of people doing that. And they have to comply with information requests from the authorities. And someone, somewhere needs to have all the records, which they will want compensation for. I suggest AWS and the likes (in house), running an old fashioned DB would require orders of magnitude less compensation for similar amounts of traffic.<p>3) The network automates the ledger system so we don&#x27;t need as many back office staff. Well, there&#x27;s no magic here. If you write a blockchain for securities operations, the logic still needs to be written by someone. There&#x27;s existing protocols for this kind of stuff, and there&#x27;s existing automation at the banks for processing this stuff. Even if you decide to go blockchain, you will have to meet with the other banks to make sure everyone agrees so they&#x27;ll want to be on the same chain. You&#x27;re still going to need back office staff to make sure the inputs and outputs make sense.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve yet to see a blockchain use that both requires and is improved by using the blockchain.",1451464032

10811255,comment,10809360,10810060,0,0,Matumio,,,"> I wish GitHub had a proper UI for deprecating/abandoning projects<p>As we see from OP, it&#x27;s really hard to admit that you don&#x27;t have time for your own project. Ideally, inactive maintainers will let go and give push right to whoever is working on their project. But more often, maintainers simply stop being active. This discourages contributors from even submitting bugfixes because the users won&#x27;t profit from their work. (I&#x27;ve once seen a project with 3 forks, each containing a slightly different commit fixing the same bug.)<p>It would help much already if GitHub displayed a prominent notice &quot;the activity on the project you&#x27;re looking at is very low, but fork A and fork B both have higher recent activity&quot;.<p>Something like a compact summary of the network graph. (The network graph is great, but has too much whitespace and requires too much scrolling to get an overview. Especially if there are 30 forks of people just committing one local hack or config file.)",1451462909

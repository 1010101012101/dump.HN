10142097,comment,10141798,10141955,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Absolutely, although it does depend. The Netherlands had and still has today very small cities where residential, commercial, office and other (local school, sports centre, park) areas are close together and easily reachable by foot, bicycle or short distance public transportation (tram, bus, subway). Building cycling infrastructure immediately pays off because you&#x27;re building transportation lanes that have 10 miles per hour speeds, in cities where citizens mostly make many 1-4 mile trips.<p>And this is a pretty common European feature really, virtually all our cities are built in the age of transport by foot or horse and are structured much differently, coupled with higher rates of population density in the Europe (vs say the US, or worse, Australia).<p>That wouldn&#x27;t work as much in say Australian cities, some of which are known for their terrible urban sprawl. The notion of building transportation lanes that average 10 miles per hour when typical citizens work, shop or go to school say 10 miles or more away from home, doesn&#x27;t make as much sense. Australia after all has seen the majority of its cities founded in the past 150 years and saw 2/3rd of its population growth in the past 50 years or so in the era of ubiquitous cars.<p>Now of course existing Dutch cities today are expanded with minimizing any urban sprawl in mind, and cycling is both an instrument to solve issues as well as drive city design to prevent issues. And new cities are entirely built with this in mind. But in terms of reinventing existing cities, it was much easier to do in the Netherlands than it&#x27;d be in say the US.<p>So while I&#x27;m Dutch and yes, 40 years ago we were heavily motorised, and had lots of traffic deaths, and had poor cycling infrastructure, and were able to reinvent ourselves, and while yes this can apply to all cities worldwide to a large extent, it&#x27;s also fair to point out that some cities would really need radical changes to decrease travel distance and create more density. e.g. by creating many small city centres where residents can do everything (most of their shopping, work, entertainment and education within miles of their home). Such radical changes require very significant leadership and an effort that dwarfs what the Dutch had to do to get where they are today.<p>That having been said I&#x27;ve also visited lots of American cities where cycling infrastructure would seem like a perfect fit. You mentioned Honolulu, I totally agree, it&#x27;s a no-brainer to build cycling infrastructure there, requiring nothing more than what the Dutch did.<p>Lastly another difference isn&#x27;t technical, economical or social or relating to geography or anything like that, but purely political. The Netherlands has always had an automotive industry but it&#x27;s always been relatively small. Virtually all cars are imported. Of the top 10 brands, 3 are German, 3 are French, 1 American/Swedish/Korean/Japanese. It&#x27;s pretty well known that the car industry helped dismantle public transportation in the US, such forces haven&#x27;t been as big a factor in the Netherlands (despite the fact Dutch Royal Shell&#x27;s oil industry was the largest company by revenue of any company worldwide in 2013, 2nd in 2014 and 3rd in 2015, revenues equivalent to about 85% of the country&#x27;s GDP (!), but it&#x27;s pretty much entirely focused outside of the Dutch market anyway).<p>Although I do recall very recently Shell funding helmets for kids which I thought was pretty funny. In 2010 only 2 kids died in traffic in the Netherlands, and it&#x27;s pretty well known that cycling is reduced when cyclists are forced to wear helmets here and that cycling&#x27;s popularity has done a lot for safety. You could take that as a clever anti-cycling measure wrapped in &#x27;safe the kids&#x27; rhetoric from Shell, but perhaps that&#x27;s paranoid.<p>Fun fact, Dutch support for Israel in the 70s may have helped the cycling culture get a tiny boost. OPEC boycotted oil sales to the Netherlands for its arms sales to Israel who was embroiled in the 73 war with various OPEC members. Dutch PM responded with car-free sundays due to oil scarcity. Of course soon after OPEC expanded the list of countries beyond the Netherlands, we started getting oil from South America and Africa instead and it didn&#x27;t last very long either (ironically there was even a bit of an oil glut in Dutch harbours because one of the biggest refineries in the world was in Rotterdam so whenever it supplied e.g. France or Germany it could circumvent the boycott), and driving less on sunday led to driving more on saturday, so it wasn&#x27;t extremely significant but I thought it probably helped a tiny bit :)",1440902661

As an engineer, I prefer smallcaps when I need someone else to read my handwriting, but if it&#x27;s just for my own consumption (task lists, notes, etc) it&#x27;s faux* cursive 99% of the time.<p>* faux because it&#x27;s really just joining letters and filling the missing letter spaces with zig zaggy curlies ... which have no bearing on readability, per this: <a href=""http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/cmabridge/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/cmabridge/</a>",1440900189

You need to carefully, and slowly, read SPJ&#x27;s Tackling the Awkward Squad. You need to allow yourself to skim over the parts that are perplexing on first-reading and take them on faith. With more understanding you&#x27;ll find even the answer given there not particularly satisfactory (in fact the paper points it out explicitly, trust me you&#x27;ll know when you&#x27;re in the precise section).<p>At this point you&#x27;ll either accept the state of affairs, or want to go deeper down the rabbit hole, at which point you become more an academic than a programmer per se.<p>In a very precise sense what groovy2shoes is saying is exactly right, and you need to understand that truly strange weirdos inhabit IO () whereas, as you point out, only one thing, modulo non-termination, inhabits ().",1440900090

The original idea of AirBNB (having strangers sleep on your couch while you are in your home) was and is a terrible idea.<p>What made AirBNB a success was not providing a way of letting people camp out in your living room, it was paying for professional photography and enabling/encouraging people to run illegal hotels. Both of these are good ideas, but they had nothing to do with the original concept behind AirBNB.",1440900083

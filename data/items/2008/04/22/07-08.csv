170389,comment,170324,170327,0,0,rms,,,"Y Combination isn't a victim here.   State funded incubators don't make it on YCs radar at all, because the state funded incubators/early stage funds are terrible at picking winners.<p>Until Y Combinator came around and revitalized the incubator model by doing it with micro-investments (and not being an incubator, something the clones have mostly failed to understand), private incubators were money losing failures.<p>As far as I am aware, AlphaLab in Pittsburgh is the only government funded incubator investing with the same magnitude as YC. They are no threat to YC, because they are only targeting people that live in Pittsburgh.<p>It does mess the Pittsburgh entrepreneurial scene up with Innovation Works and the Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse being the gateway to angel investment. But I believe strongly that we are much better off with them than without them. If they were gone, millions of dollars of additional capital wouldn't come to Pittsburgh to replace them. Investors don't avoid Pittsburgh because they have to compete with the PA government; the PA government isn't very good at investment.\nInvestors stay away because no rich people want to live here.

I tested SimpleDB pretty thoroughly for the next version of Gridjit and decided against using it.<p>One of the drawbacks to working with these sorts of storage services is the temptation to create overly-abstract models too early. Abstraction and metadata-based schemas are great but can also add needless complexity (ironically) early on.",1208850265

The 'real men' of old were the systems programmers, they used to use assembly.<p>I remember reading something similar in dr dobbs years ago that had exactly the same argument going, 'real men' write assembly, everybody else uses C (which was still considered to be a high level language at the time).<p>Our definition of 'high level' is shifting, and apparently so is what we consider to be 'real programming'.<p>C is more like (old style) lego, the bricks are small and simple but you can build very complex stuff out of it once you master the principle. It will do very little 'out of the box' but once you get it your limits are your fantasy, there are no 'domain specific' bricks.<p>I wonder how much of the reasons for these preferences can be traced back to what you were playing with as a kid!",1249212785

737320,comment,737206,737206,0,0,spyrosk,,,"One thing that is puzzling me for some time is why vegetarians think it's more moral/nice/whatever to eat plants and not animals. They too are living creatures and most of the times you are killing a being in order to consume it for your personal gain. I'll skip the analogy between fruits and their mamal equivelant, but you get the idea..<p>Thing is, survival is a really competitive process and unless you want to get off sooner, you have to take things away from other organisms, human or otherwise. We, as a civilisation, may have raised it to a more noble, according to our perception, level but fundamentally it's still the same.\nEthos is mostly the refined version of pack rules evolved to make sure an individual doesn't hurt the well being of the group. It's a human fabrication.<p>With that said I agree with the author's view, try to do as much good as you possibly can, while realising that just by living you are causing harm to someone/something else.",1249212327

737316,comment,736794,737132,0,0,haberman,,,"> Tables for layout didn't really take off until the late 90's<p>Which was coincidentally when websites started having sidebars.  Are you arguing in favor of pre-1995 web design?  Are you arguing that there is a <i>more</i> natural way than tables to express site layouts with sidebars?<p>When I say ""prior to CSS"" I mean ""prior to wide CSS adoption and browser support"".  Yes, CSS1 was released in 1996, but it didn't really catch on among web authors for a few years (and wasn't really practical to use anyway due to limited browser support).  In that intervening time, websites started sprouting sidebars, and basically all the sites that used sidebars did so with HTML tables.<p>> And even when they did take off, tables were still burdened with the sorts of quirks and browser incompatibilities people complain about with CSS<p>Quirks or no, HTML-based tables are more fit for describing layouts than CSS ever will be until web authors can use ""display: table"" or something like that.  With HTML-based tables, you're working around <i>browser quirks</i> (which really aren't as bad as you make them out to be).  With CSS, you're working with a language that is too weak (even if implemented perfectly) to express what you're trying to say.  With CSS, a three-column layout (something that many, many sites want) is considered a ""holy grail"" (<a href=""http://www.alistapart.com/articles/holygrail/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/holygrail/</a>).<p>CSS (pre-""display:table"") doesn't have the right abstractions for achieving designers' demonstrated needs.

Especially a lot of Fortune 500 companies tend to have their own frameworks programmed in C. They're generally not interested in rapid prototyping, but rather in performance, tools and most of all code stability (i.e. you don't want your website to depend on the security/updates of an interpreter). Gradually this is moving to Java (and .NET) for the reasons you mentioned, but it's a slow process.",1249211951

737305,comment,737260,737278,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I think that a big part of it is that C is <i>simple</i>. The thread of execution is dead obvious, it is almost - but not quite - like looking at assembler. In C++ you have more options to create interesting bugs, every operator has a potential side effect depending on the context.<p>Sure that can be done in C too, but you have to work a little harder for that.<p>When reliability - or lives - are at stake and plenty of systems software written in C controls mission critical stuff it helps to see what is actually going on.<p>By sticking to a very simple subset you make it easier to find problems before they cause nasty accidents.<p>I know of plenty of situations where even an OS would be a detriment, these run on totally stripped down kernels that probably the majority of programmers would no longer recognize as an operating system proper but would instead call a loader or something to that effect.<p>C++ offers the same advantages that C does but it also offers a single disadvantage that C does not have, it's more expressive. In other words you can make your C code do lots of stuff but you will not be able to say it in roughly more than one way.<p>In C++ there are endless ways to do the same thing. That means there is more to remember and that in turn means that programmer expertise is a much bigger factor in quality. I think systems level guys have learned the hard way that the KISS principle is the most important programming guideline there is.",1249211013

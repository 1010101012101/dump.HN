For years I&#x27;ve been thinking it was &quot;money lenders&quot; not &quot;money changers.&quot;<p>I read the link you pointed to. It affirms that the plantiff&#x27;s claim is &quot;consonant with the plain language of the 7th Amendment.&quot;<p>There must be a typo there, as the 7th is right to a trial by jury, while the given quote about &quot;nor shall private property ...&quot; is from the 5th.<p>I don&#x27;t see though how this is an effective argument. Every single lawsuit filed in opposition to an eminent domain seizure <i>must</i> claim that the seizure is violation of the 5th amendment. So of course this lawsuit is &quot;consonant with the plain language of the 5th Amendment&quot; as otherwise it would be thrown out as being unjustified.<p>A more effective argument would point to existing legal cases, to show how the courts have previously ruled. But the comment you linked to dismissed Kelo - a case which gives some idea of how much the Supreme Court may defer to local governments - <i>without</i> giving any reference to other more relevant cases.",1377471587

If not they have a tendency to go missing.  The important thing is tracking what has been authorized for payment. Without solving that a protocol would risk being just another black hole where unpaid invoices languish.<p>Instead build something that tracks approved invoices.  When an invoice is approved the vendor gets an email asking them to fill in a form, entering all the data from the invoice. Include a big &quot;pay me&quot; button at the bottom.

Self-driving cars, Glass, DistBelief, etc.<p>In fact, one thing that&#x27;s unusual about Google is how much R&D actually makes it into products (unlike, say, Microsoft, whose research group turns out great stuff but rarely does anything with it). In that sense, it&#x27;s less pure blue-sky, but more applied. I think it&#x27;s more akin to the Manhattan Project, Apollo program, etc - scientists and engineers working closely together to redefine what&#x27;s possible.

The grounding for <i>Terry</i> searches is <i>exclusively</i> officer safety. <i>Terry</i> searches are the basis of &quot;stop and frisk&quot;.<p>The second common authorization is &quot;incident to arrest&quot;. The police can conduct a thorough search of your person, effects, and immediate vicinity if they actually place you under arrest. The grounding for this search is both officer safety <i>and</i> collection of evidence.

For the individual home, yes, it is a stretch to think that the value of an inflated mortgage is less than the value of the house. But, they are thinking in terms of the population of all underwater homes. There is an increased rate of default on underwater mortgages. So, you could argue (and they are), that the lost value when spread out among all underwater mortgages, makes the pool of them less valuable than the value of the homes themselves.<p>To know the answer, you&#x27;d have to know the normal rate of default, the rate of default for underwater mortgages, and the average amount the bank looses when a mortgage defaults (as well as the average value of the homes and the inflated mortgage valuations).<p>It is very possible that when all of the numbers are calculated that offering below the appraised value of the home for the mortgage is approximates fair market value over the whole population of underwater homes. A loan wouldn&#x27;t necessarily have to be distressed to fall into that statistical population.<p>If you think in terms of one house, this plan doesn&#x27;t make sense. But, when you think in terms of an entire city, it starts to make more sense (if the numbers and rates line up).

6273902,comment,6268080,6271462,1,0,mercer,,,"I think a big problem lies in the individualist approach combined with a reserved attitude toward others. When you start a &#x27;new life&#x27; in a new place where you cannot rely on massive amounts of free time, or structured &#x27;community&#x27; (university, high school, church), you have to find shortcuts to making &#x27;significant&#x27; connections.<p>I&#x27;ve done okay on that front, having moved to a completely new place very often in my life. I find that one of the secrets is being extra honest, and extra open, instead of waiting for &#x27;organic&#x27; moments of connection. These moments happen if you have loads of time to spend with people. If you don&#x27;t have the time, too much can happen to get in the way of making such a connection before it is too late.<p>I rather like this quote in the context. Can&#x27;t remember who wrote it:<p>&quot;We waste so much energy trying to cover up who we are when beneath every attitude is the want to be loved, and beneath every anger is a wound to be healed and beneath every sadness is the fear that there will not be enough time.<p>When we hesitate in being direct, we unknowingly slip something on, some added layer of protection that keeps us from feeling the world, and often that thin covering is the beginning of a loneliness which, if not put down, diminishes our chances of joy.<p>Its like wearing gloves every time we touch something, and then, forgetting we chose to put them on, we complain that nothing feels quite real. Our challenge each day is not to get dressed to face the world but to unglove ourselves so that the doorknob feels cold and the car handle feels wet and the kiss goodbye feels like the lips of another being, soft and unrepeatable.&quot;",1377468027

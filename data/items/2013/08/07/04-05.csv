And that this decision is in fact not driven just by the fact that it is seldom used, but driven more-so by the corporate interests they hold with advertising and other online entities that serve not for the browser users, but their own corporate interests. This fundamentally collides with the intent of the Mozilla foundations purpose and this behavior must stop.<p>The ability to disable javascript has been on the main screen of the options panel because it serves a very important purpose.<p>Also the ability to not show tabs when browsing a single web page because for that use case, it is more optimal to not show a tab and waste the screen real estate on dead space.<p>They have fundamentally altered the Firefox browser in a fundamental way that is not configurable and have not provided reasonable alternative.<p>I refuse to accept any so called &quot;Add-On&quot;.

6170925,comment,6169999,6169999,1,0,codex,,,"This article claims that some regulations exist to protect certain industries.  The proof is the fact that these regulations are harmful to various new startups but not to existing industry.  But that&#x27;s not proof: that&#x27;s correlation without causation.  It is just as likely, if not <i>more</i> likely, that certain regulations were instituted to protect the public or to perform a public good, and the current industries have evolved, like an organism, to coexist with the regulations.  Just because an industry has adapted to work within the law does not mean that the law was put in place to protect that industry.<p>For example, NYC regs which are harmful to AirBnB exist to protect other tenants from the insecurities that stem from a revolving door of transients in their buildings.  Simliarly, taxi cab medallions restrict supply in order to prevent a tragedy of the commons whereby too many cabs fight for fares in congested city cores, taking up all available road space.<p>In this respect, these startups are not innovative--just stupid enough to operate extra-legally.  Just because something can be done more easily with technology does not mean it should be done.",1375851408

6170911,comment,6170757,6170757,6,0,nostrademons,,,"I assume you&#x27;re actually thinking of going into software engineering as a profession, and not just getting a CS degree and doing something else.  The latter can actually be pretty useful in a variety of scientific, technical, and management fields, except you have to pair it with something.  Anyway, here&#x27;s my list (for reference, I&#x27;m 32, have roughly 9 years of professional experience all of it in software, and currently work on search for Google.  I have a CS degree but went to a liberal arts college and switched around between physics, philosophy, and sociology before settling on it):<p>1. Programming is a very cognitively demanding and highly rational skill.  To do it well, you to some extent need to &quot;shut down&quot; your emotional circuitry and your intuitions about how things <i>should</i> work, pay very careful attention to how things <i>do</i> work, and then retrain your instincts to take this into account.  All on a very rigorous, formal, mathematical level.  Unfortunately, if you do this without simultaneously maintaining an active social life, you risk finding yourself unable to relate to &quot;normal&quot; people.  It&#x27;s not just that programming attracts geeks, it&#x27;s that programming enough can <i>turn you into</i> a geek.  This is avoidable (some of the top minds in our field have a life outside work and are quite approachable as human beings), but it requires that you set strict limits on the time you spend hacking - which can often be hard to keep to when you hear about a 19-year-old kid who invented a peer-to-peer protocol or a 23-year-old who invented a programming language.<p>2. There&#x27;s an expiration date on your knowledge.  It&#x27;s not as drastic as some people make it out to be - it is still possible to get hired as an engineer past 40.  But pretty much  everything you learned when you first started out will be obsolete.  I&#x27;ve only been doing this since 2000 and I&#x27;ve had to reinvent myself at least three times - I started as a desktop UI dev working with Java Swing; then I learned JS and web technologies pretty deeply; then I got into unstructured data mining, clustering, and ranking algorithms; now I&#x27;m back doing UI, but for mobile web devices (which have completely different performance characteristics as desktop) in a lead role.  In fields like law or accounting you gradually learn more of a huge body of relatively static knowledge, and so your intellectual capital increases monotonically over your career.  In computing, large bodies of knowledge become completely obsolete overnight, and so you can easily have huge discontinuities in your career where you have to adapt or fade into irrelevance.<p>3. Programming is not amenable to just putting in your time and packing it away when you go home at 5.  It&#x27;s a creative profession, and creativity is subject to the whims of your brain and requires engagement and grappling with the subject.  Many programmers find it really hard to work on a set schedule - Paul Graham has a good essay called &quot;Maker&#x27;s schedule vs. Manager&#x27;s schedule&quot; on this.<p>4. The egos.  A large segment of the software world seems to be composed of people who keep trying to one-up each others in their knowledge of esoteric trivia, and then once they&#x27;ve found something they know that nobody else does, suddenly everyone else is an idiot.  This is exhausting and not all that pleasant.  It is much more prevalent in some communities than others - there are places you can go that are quite supportive, where <i>everybody</i> is interested in learning new things and new knowledge is gently pointed out and explained - but if you read many of the places where programmers gather, there are many a pissing contest that are just complete wastes of time.",1375851220

It was mostly client-side logic with a FireBase backend.<p>I developed the first prototype in pure JS and there were some bugs (due to me being new to this FireBase model, and some hastily developed code).<p>I then converted the whole thing to TypeScript, because I prefer static typing. It took some time to setup: upgrading to the latest nodejs, collecting all type definitions for popular libraries, etc. The DefinitelyTyped[1] library is a great resource. But there were some warts in it. I had to make some PRs to this library for some missing methods in jQuery.<p>But right after finishing the setup, I was able to find and fix a complicated sequencing bug. That alone was worth the trouble of the setup cost.<p>I then tried using TypeScript for another project (this one had a licensed IDEA available). Here the setup cost was even lower. There are plugins available for Typescript in IDEA. Though I couldn&#x27;t convince everyone in the team to switch to TypeScript.<p>This was back before they added generics support. Now that generics is added, I think there is hardly any excuse left to not use TypeScript (or a similar alternative).<p>What would make TypeScript awesome is support from more IDEs (Eclipse especially).<p>[1](<a href=""https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped</a>)",1375850938

At the same time, other landlords don&#x27;t see the hassle  and potential drama of subletting as worth the cost and prohibit the practice.<p>In the same way, I can see SAAS providers going two ways on this. Some might welcome your &quot;sublet as a service&quot; and explicitly take advantage of it as a way to broaden the market that they serve.

I want to want one, seriously, but every time I go back and look into getting one I just realize I don&#x27;t want it. E-books are no bargain compared to print and I don&#x27;t think the reading experience matches a real book, so really the only benefit is convenience and ability to store multiple books in a compact tablet which doesn&#x27;t carry much weight either, I&#x27;m afraid.<p>So my point is that I wonder whether the market is reaching a point where those who wanted to try an e-reader made the purchase and are happily using their Kindles and Nooks and the rest don&#x27;t give a shit.

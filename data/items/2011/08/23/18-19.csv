2917891,comment,2914405,2915327,1,0,fleitz,,,"IMHO it's largely a side effect of first class functions. In Java in order to pass a function you need to pass an object that has the function, or an interface with the function, so it leads to a lot of line noise and thus people don't do it much. DI doesn't look impressive in a functional language because it's so well supported, but if you look at something like a global accumulator in a functional language you'll need a monad because you need state.<p>eg in Java it's easier to write:<p><pre><code>  int accum = 0;\n  for(int i : collection){\n    accum +=i;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nrather than<p><pre><code>  collection.reduce(new IReduce<int> { \n    int reduce(int accum, int i){\n      return i + accum;\n    }\n    })\n</code></pre>\nI'm a bit rusty on Java so the syntax may be off but you get the idea, where as in a functional language (F#) that code is reduced to:<p><pre><code>  collection \n  |> Seq.reduce +\n</code></pre>\nOr in an imperative language that supports function passing (C#)<p><pre><code>  collection.sum((a,b) => a+b)</code></pre>",1314125908

2917878,comment,2915835,2916700,3,0,roel_v,,,"Inca rulers and the upper class used gold for decoration and to make things like tableware from - the point of this discussion is whether it was used as currency, which it wasn't. How are you going to call something a currency when it's only hanging on the wall of the upper 2% of society? I'm not sure what point you're trying to make, but you said that gold was used by all societies of the last 1000's of years as a currency, but it flat out <i>isn't</i>. <i>Most</i> societies, yes, but not all - and that's important, because it shows that in places where there is a relative abundance of gold, it's not good as a currency (the non-use of gold in Inca times was not solely because of high supply, I'm not interested in arguing details on Inca culture and economics here because frankly I don't know much more about it than what a couple of tour guides told me).<p><i>Anyway</i>, let's go back to 2007. A house in Phoenix that sold for 250k in 2004 just reached one million. Which would you have rather bought back in 2004? That house, or a gold eagle?<p>My point - it's easy to make a 'case' with perfect hindsight. There are several drivers to the current high price of gold; people diversifying their portfolios into precious metals, Chinese millionaire who have limited options for storing value, increasing demand from emerging markets for jewelry. That's not the point; the point is that you are claiming that gold has 'intrinsic' value ('Gold is real money that holds it's value over time.'). That's bullshit, plain and simple. Yes, gold has historically been a relatively constant value store, but there is nothing intrinsically valuable about it, and (the vast majority of) those claiming it is are alarmist nutcases with little grasp of economics.",1314125710

It may very well be beautiful and unique, but are they really suggesting that Google cloned Java <i>merely</i> because they didn't want to take the time to come up with their own API and <i>not</i> because they wanted to interoperate with existing Java code and tools? Oracle points out that Google's Java is not 100% compatible, but so what? It's still compatible with a large subset of Java, and a large subset of tools and libraries do, in fact, work with Android unmodified.<p>Is there not some aspect of copyright law that prevents these sorts of doomsday abuse scenarios e.g. someone copyrights the sound of breathing and we all choke to death?

There is virtually no chance that a generalist developer will ever build sound crypto with a library like that.<p>The good kind of crypto library is Keyczar. Keyczar removes degrees of freedom; it says, ""you don't tell me what block cipher to use, and you don't remember that your messages need a MAC, and you don't choose the order operations happen in, and your keys are all going to be from a CSPRNG, and you'll use this keystore, and that will be that"". There are a very few other libraries like that (Guttman's cryptlib is another).<p>Unfortunately, nobody uses libraries like that. They use OpenSSL (via their language's bindings to it) which seems to work until it blows up in their face during a pentest.<p>My best advice is to use Bouncycastle's PGP implementation, which again removes all the degrees of freedom <i>and</i> has the benefit of building on very well studied constructions (poorly regarded constructions, but survivors nonetheless).",1314124097

2917645,comment,2917389,2917483,21,0,raganwald,,,"From my imperfect recollection:<p>Margin is traditionally formulated as the difference between the selling price and the cost of goods sold (“COGS”), basically all of the variable costs required to manufacture the unit and ship it to the customer.<p>Cost of Good Sold does not include the infrastructure required to get the customer to buy it. So while shipping the unit to an Apple Store might be included in COGS, the rent Apple pays for the store and the salaries of the geniuses in the store are not part of COGS. Marketing expenses are not part of COGS. There’s another value, Cost of Sales or “COS,” that includes certain somewhat fixed but discretionary costs associated with selling the product. COS is always larger than COGS.<p>Anyways, “margin” is a useful thing to know when comparing products and companies, however we cannot assume that just because Apple has high margins, that there is a business opportunity for someone to have lower margins. It could be that the other business will be killed by their Cost of Sales. This is especially a problem when competing with an incumbent: Marketing and other costs are going to be very high while you try to compete with the juggernaut.<p>Imagine, for example, that Apple spends $1,000,000 a month marketing to a certain small segment of the market. If you want to sell to the same segment, you are going to need to spend serious coin to offset Apple’s million dollars a month plus all the goodwill Apple enjoys from making products people actually like.<p>But your sales are insignificant to begin with, so your COS will far exceed any margin you plan to extract, putting you in the red from day one. Meanwhile, Apple is spending that $1,000,000 a month out of their high margins. And worse, if you expect your price to do all the talking for you, what will you do when Apple launches the iPad Nano at a low price? Their COGS are lower than yours, so they can obliterate your price advantage with a single press release announcing a Black Thursday sale.<p>The hard truth is, competing on price is a difficult job. You need to have very deep pockets and some expectation of a big payoff down the road to make back the money you lose up front. You need to have a COGS edge. In other words, you need to <i>innovate</i> somewhere other than deciding to charge less. Dell did that back in the day with their supply chain optimization. Apple does that now. You need to do something more than simply cut margins: You need to <i>disrupt</i> the tablet business.<p>It is not impossible, but it is more than simply sharpening your pencil. <i>Exempli gratia</i>: Kindle, as noted by another commenter elsewhere.",1314123177

This is not necessarily a deficiency in kernel code because it can make other code more complex, but fundamentally error handling and cleanup usually either requires 1) keeping track of a bunch of state  and then using complicated logic to evaluate the state for error cases 2) exception catching such that error conditions can be thrown up, caught, and brought to a cohesive resolution or 3) goto, such that cohesive cleanup code can be placed together in a segment and then jumped to on error conditions. (3) is far superior to (1) and, while (2) is arguably superior to (3), it simply doesn't exist in C.<p>The second case is that C doesn't have a multi-level break. That is, when in multiple nested blocks (loops), in order to exit early one would have to keep track of state and use conditionals to trigger a ""waterfall"" break all the way down the block chain. goto solves this by allowing you to jump out of the chain completely. I think most people would probably agree that adding a multilevel break (e.g., ""break 2;"") would probably be preferable to using goto here, but I think the workaround is basic enough (either use goto or refactor into separate functions) that the language addition is unlikely now.",1314123085

You argue that an animal based example illustrates all these different possibilities in an object oriented approach.<p>>> Are ducks a ""subclass"" of bird? How do we handle the face that penguins and ducks can swim and penguins can't fly? Is it useful to consider be the penguin as a ""bird"" at all. Perhaps we shouldn't have a ""bird"" class but an ""animal"" class. Should we do multiple inheritance? Mixins? Templates? Perhaps we'd be better with an ""animal"" class and allow some animals to fly and some to swim? Are complex classes like this bad? How could all these different approaches to OO design be applied?<p>The problem is that this is completely divorced from anything that any sane person learning programming would want to do.<p>Sure, printing ""quack"" is interesting for the first page of a tutorial, but I would expect that the usefulness of the examples in a tutorial would scale with their difficulty. If you're using multiple inheritance, mixins, and templates, you should be using code that either <i>requires</i> these techniques or <i>benefits</i> from them.<p>Imagine you're a novice programmer. You've used a computer your whole life, and do awesome things with it every day. You want to learn how to make it do cool things. In and of themselves templates, mixins, and inheritance are not cool things. They are only cool if you know what they can help you do. A <i>novice</i> programmer will have <i>no idea</i> what they can help him do.<p>So, for a tutorial aimed at teaching someone their 12th programming language, use birds/ducks. But if you're aiming at teaching a novice, and you use a birds/ducks example you have almost certainly failed to keep your student engaged. Instead, go with something that doesn't cover all the bases, but starts to show how much work can be accomplished with some simple OO structures.",1314122989

Cohesive groups where we're less worried about looking bad might be more effective.<p>c) Pair programming -- even though I'd definitely consider myself an introvert, pair programming doesn't rise to the level of social invasiveness that I would find problematic. In other words, most introverts dislike being around large groups, strangers, trying to chit-chat/schmooze, etc... but are often find around smaller groups of people they know and get along with. So I'd be hesitant to group pair programming with the others. OTOH, I've never had to do it all day long, so I'm not sure how that feels. Can anyone speak to that?",1333227510

At its core, Groupon’s U.S. business is a receivables factoring business, as I wrote last year. They give loans to small businesses at a very steep rate (the price of the discount plus Groupon’s commission). They get the money to fund these loans from credit card companies such as Chase Paymentech. Groupon is essentially a sub-prime lender that does zero risk assessment.""",1333227381

In other words, DDoS is a server-side problem, not a client problem. Whereas I (and I think that most people) believe that it is our responsibility to use our computing resources responsibly, and work hard to avoid being included in a botnet.<p>You seem like a smart person, and I'm sure you have something to contribute to the client-side of this issue, but that won't happen until you are convinced that there is a client-side problem.<p>In any event, somewhat selfishly I suppose, I've found this discussion quite useful in clarifying my own views on the matter.

This not only requires a lot of space, it's also getting more difficult to back up in a certain amount of time (you probably want your full backups to finish before starting incrementals). There are various workarounds for these issues (compression, snapshots, deduplication etc.), but none of them have really solved them yet.<p>Secondly, the disks used for backups are usually part of disk arrays and those are quite expensive and also require some administration.<p>Thirdly, disks are only one part of the story - tapes are not dead yet and probably won't be for a while. They are usually faster than disks (when streaming speed is achieved), cheaper per TB of storage, can be stored more efficiently etc. There are drawbacks of course, so bigger companies usually create multi-tiered backup systems combining all available solutions.<p>As for the deletion of old data - some data has to be archived/available for a long time in order to e.g. comply with certain laws, but in general one implements multiple retention policies, depending on the importance of data.

3781395,comment,3780619,3780619,7,0,oz,,,"Here in Jamaica, and I've read, many other less-developed nations, Blackberry phones are the most popular. By far. Overwhelmingly, this is due to BlackBerry Messenger, or BBM. It's almost like a small social network in and of itself. A friend of mine runs a phone sale / repair business via BBM. Every morning, he broadcasts items for sale and daily specials. Deliveries and payments are also co-ordinated via BBM. Party promoters also put their BBM PIN and QR Code on fliers, and keep you updated via BBM. My <i>bank</i> is on BBM...<p>Blackberry Internet Service (BIS) is also affordable. My BIS plan costs ~17USD, which gives me email access, unlimited data, and BBM. Normal data plans for use with an iPhone / Android phone would cost approximately double that, and most are metered.<p>I use my Bold 2 (9700) with Google Apps for my personal / business email. Works great. Email, Contacts, and Calendar entries sync seamlessly out of the box. Email is <i>instantaneous</i>. From here in Jamaica, over my home WiFi, if I send an email from Gmail's web interface, in literally 2 seconds it shows up on my phone as a Sent Message. I can also 'star' messages, archive them, label them and it supports Gmail conversation view. The browser in OS v6 is ok...I haven't experienced much other mobile browsers. ihackernews.com is a lifesaver, and my home page....<p>I don't have access to all the apps in the iOS ecosystem, but I'm actually quite satisfied. And I love the keyboard. When data plans get cheaper, though, I might switch to an Android phone running CyanogenMod.<p>FWIW, my PIN is 21C714C2. Always happy to chat with a fellow HNer.",1333224701

3781386,comment,3780247,3780729,2,0,rogerbinns,,,"The main overhead for MongoDB's storage is that the ""column name"" (keys) is stored in every record rather than just once as with traditional SQL database and some of the other NoSQL solutions.  That is why you'll often see developers using very short key names, and one use for an ""ORM"" to translate between developer friendly names and short stored names.<p>Of course this can be solved fairly easily by the MongoDB developers by having a table mapping between short tokens/numbers and the long names.

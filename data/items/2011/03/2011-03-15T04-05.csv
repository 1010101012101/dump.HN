2326046,comment,2325017,2325017,0,0,yewweitan,,,"I agree with the author almost almost every point. There is one which raised a question in my mind.<p>The author states:<p>""The music industry is the problem—too many bad songs are the problem. It’s the reason the audience doesn’t roar when you talk about playing a new track or two that were added for a re-release of your greatest hits. If your greatest hits were from the last three years, imagine how much money you’d be making on album sales even beyond your touring.""<p>When he says ""greatest hits"" here, what exactly is he referring to? Am I right to assume, that he means that bands, just like startups, need to be continuously iterating and innovating?<p>If so, then I'll sympathise a little with the frustration a musician must feel.<p>I think it's fair to say that musicians make their money of their long-time fans, which implies that they need to keep people happy with their music for a long period of time.<p>I think this is slightly harder for a musician, since unlike a startup, they don't explicitly have a ""problem"" to solve. For myself, I used to be a great Linkin Park fan, and I still think that 'Hybrid Theory' and 'Meteora' are 2 of the best albums around. They lost me after that unfortunately, and being 14 at the time when Meteora was released means that I never gave the band any cash.<p>On the other hand, there are other bands that I've been following for a long time whom I still gladly pay for their music. E.S Posthumous released their album 'Makara' last year, and even though its on YouTube, I still paid for the thing --- Thanks to iTunes =) [by the way check them out - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0kH781DV0U"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0kH781DV0U</a>] The same goes for bands like 'Mr Big' and their album 'What if','Nightwish' with their album 'Dark Passions Play', and Steve Vai with his recent 'Live in Minneapolis' album.<p>I use those bands as an example because they've been around for awhile (10 years or more) and still can provide innovative, new music that retains the same appeal as their previous work, but yet provides a distinct WOW factor to it. ie: same but different.<p>I personally think that very few bands can do that, and the industry that supports long-term creativity like this will inevitably be small.<p>So that's a long way of saying that I agree with the author's premise, and that the music industry of the past is bound to see a major change (relatively shrinkage) thanks to the inherent nature of the craft along with the new-found efficiency of distribution.",1300165042

I seem to recall that you were the one that suggested that somebody could not possibly be a good developer without a strong understanding of Bachmann-Landau notation and the associated complexity theory. That's rather insulting of an awful lot of quite good professional working developers in my book. Pardon me if I take umbrage with stabs at me and my colleague's profession.<p>I know that you've spent a great deal of time working towards your PhD (congratulations btw), but I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess you've never worked for any significant length of time on production systems out in the world. In my younger years I too worked in academia (for an actual for real Nuke Lab believe it or not). It's a vastly different world, with different notions of what's necessary, what's useful and what's required to operate in the respective worlds.<p>The transition betwixt the two was not easy for me as I often rallied for far more rigor than was needed or required for any day to day development task. Why didn't we have a documented mathematically rigorous proof of the validity of the login system?! Ye gads! How can people operate this way? How come nobody knows the strict storage and space requirements of such and such algorithm?! What do you mean nobody can give me a provable upper and lower bound runtime for this query, you say ""it's guarantee to finish before the Universe grows cold?""!?!?! How can the world function?! You mean nobody has ever calculated an average estimate for these portions of the queuing system?! What kind of knuckle dragging place is this?!<p>But you know what, things got built, they more or less worked, we got payed and then we moved on to the next project.<p>The poll could go either way and show either you or me right -- or open up good discussion.

2326036,comment,2317359,2324830,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""Otherwise, can iptables ban those who failed more than 10 SSH logins?""<p>Yes, sort of, though it's not ""more than 10"", it's ""drop packets that look suspiciously like an automated attack"", which I think is actually cooler because it never outright bans anyone but it makes it impossible to run an effective brute force attack. You'd use the ""--state NEW"" option to determine whether the connection is a new one or an established one. If someone connects over and over again to ssh (or any login-able service, really) within a short time you can drop them. Rules would look something like this:<p><pre><code>  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -i eth0 -m state --state NEW --dport 22 -m recent --update --seconds 15 -j DROP

  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -i eth0 -m state --state NEW --dport 22 -m recent --set -j ACCEPT
</code></pre>
Assuming, of course, that you're already accepting ESTABLISHED connections above those rules.<p>iptables is astonishingly powerful and flexible, and it's usually pretty easy to google up the right recipes, if you aren't quite sure of the incantations. It can be a little intimidating, but it more than repays you for the effort. When I did network consulting I was always surprised when I came upon a network where they had a Linux router, web server, mail server, etc., and then a Cisco PIX firewall sitting in front of it. Once again, it's just needless complexity, when the Linux box could do everything the PIX does (and possibly more, in the case of the low end PIX that I usually see).<p>Since you have professed iptables ignorance...are you sure CSF is doing anything sensible in your deployment? By that, I mean, do you have any idea what your firewall rules are actually doing and if they are effective for what you think they are effective for? I'm always a bit wary when I come upon a network where the people maintaining it have no idea what their systems are doing or how they work. While CSF may be a net positive, if the trend is toward avoiding knowledge, it's a dangerous direction to go in. I'm all for simplifying, and sometimes tools make things simpler. But, as I said, in my experience the ""pile of shell"" firewall scripts complexify things rather than simplify them.",1300164808

While it is true that hipster is not as offensive as some other classifying words and carries none of the historical baggage, it has become a slur, nothing more.<p>What you've described sounds like a caricature. While it is possible that the more nuanced culture formed elsewhere and was made extreme on it's way to your shores (and, indeed, there is evidence of this having happened in many other cases), I am not sure that is what is going on here. The specific attitude you describe is one I see commonly attributed to hipsters, and only in very rare cases a fair characterization. I think that The Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Radiohead (to throw something out there) are examples of incredibly commercial, mainstream bands which most of the people you are describing would be into.<p>Saying that you don't like the new Shins album because it is very mainstream doesn't actually mean that you don't like it because people are buying it (they aren't), it means that it doesn't seem challenging or interesting to you. It seems designed for mainstream appeal.<p>In the US, the word is not applied solely to the group that you describe, either. It's used to describe people who live in particular areas, people who ride bicycles, people who shop at thrift stores, people who listen to public radio, people who see lots of live music, and people who listen to records on vinyl, and this is by no means an exhaustive list. The most important thing is that people seem to have flipped your description of the attitude on it's head; It's not about whether or not you dislike ""mainstream"" or ""commercial"" things, it's about whether or not you like something which <i>doesn't</i> fall into one of these categories.<p>I agree that your description of this group doesn't make me want to hang out with anyone in it, but it certainly doesn't make me feel like I shouldn't tollerate it. If there is a group of people who want to be very bad at conversation at parties, more power to them.<p>If I believed that most people made these judgements on a case by case basis, that would be one thing, but that's not the case in my experience.

But let's not forget this was a horrible natural disaster first. We engineers never said a meltdown could never happen but that we have done everything possible to minimize the risk. I can predict that the amount of lives lost and property damaged due to this accident will pale when compared to other forms of energy including coal, gas or oil when things go wrong -- a price we pay every single day and is so common it hardly registers as news. What was cost of the BP oil spill? Read your local news for <i>local</i> gas explosions, oil spills, injured workers, etc.  People are killed in the coal industry every single year. These are such every day occurrences they don't even register unless many people are killed or it involves barrels of oil.

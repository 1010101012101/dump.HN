Finding somebody who has a real complaint seems before starting litigation seems like a good solution, because it ensures that at least one person was harmed.

I&#x27;m working normally, would love to see a way to make this (a port) happen in the evenings. $50 would be more than I would like to spend here, because it&#x27;s my own money and the end result - even if successful - is probably a &#x27;Huh? Interesting..&#x27; and that&#x27;s that. It would be for my own amusement.<p>2) To see if it will improve my workflow I&#x27;d need to invest (time) in it first. Since I don&#x27;t have a use case for SS (see 1) I see no point doing that in the moment. I learn new stuff every day, the queue is basically endless. SS could&#x27;ve jumped to the top if it would&#x27;ve been a viable option. So I&#x27;m not making the case that it won&#x27;t improve my workflow: I plainly don&#x27;t know anything about it.<p>3) Yes, my salary is more than a grand / month. But that&#x27;s a crappy metric. It certainly feels as if lots of people here make $100+ a year, the SF crowd. Right, if you basically cost that much in 4 days then this might be something to argue. But that scale changes rapidly with smaller salaries.<p>4) Even if we agree that $ 1000 (per nose) is nothing, who&#x27;s going to spend that? No clue how this works in other companies, but here you have to make a case, get X people from management to agree. Why would they? &quot;I would be more productive&quot;? Without snark, I&#x27;d really like to see a case for a purchase like this that could work in my scenario.

No offense, not trying to attack you here - I just want to make it blatantly clear that &#x27;random&#x27; comments a la &#x27;that money is nothing&#x27; are - if not wrong in general - not useful here.<p>5) Quitting can be a big deal.

9434449,comment,9431944,9432291,0,0,ffn,,,"Absolutely, Haskell has a richness of concepts to it that&#x27;s entirely in a class of its own... but that being said, Haskell is to programming what sex is to life (for a woman... because men&#x27;s natural enjoyment of sex throws off my following analogy). Granted there is richness and joy in finally discovering it, one needs to realize it&#x27;s important that one isn&#x27;t forced into it too early. Haskell demands a lot of thinking up front and therefore requires a programmer of a certain logical / organizational maturity in order for the process not to be frustrating and painful (or even traumatizing). Haskell (like C, Lisp, and the arcane slog known as Erlang) should rarely be someone&#x27;s first language.<p>And that&#x27;s where Ruby, Python, Javascript, and to some extent Matlab come in. For whatever else people may say about them later (they don&#x27;t scale, they&#x27;re a roadblock, they&#x27;re a mess, null is not a function, etc.), they were there for you when you were programmatically young and they introduced you gently into a world that&#x27;s otherwise extremely complex.<p>After all, programming, like literally everything else, is 99% human and 1% logic, machines, data, &quot;scaling&quot;, etc. Programs are written by people for people (incidentally they can also be read by a computer), so it&#x27;s incredible important that the 99% of that equation (you the programmer) don&#x27;t become discouraged at the onset by an extremely elegant, expressive, but rather rapey language before you&#x27;re ready for it. In that sense, it&#x27;s absolutely okay to be &quot;seduced&quot; by an easy scripting language in the beginning. Eventually, though, when you start lamenting about &quot;undefined is not a function&quot; and how that could be so easily avoided when proper type-checking, that&#x27;s your body telling you that you&#x27;re ready for Haskell now.",1429893895

I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve seen people that have air-tight cases but they, understandably, won&#x27;t, or can&#x27;t, pay hundreds of thousands of dollars (filing fees and attorney&#x27;s fees) to pull the trigger. The cost for these things is truly astronomical compared to quite literally every other aspect of the patent office. Even more astounding is that there is no reduction in fees for entity size (like almost every other fee). So a solo inventor and a Fortune 500 company pay exactly the same amount in filing fees, which is absurd and makes zero sense (even the older, reexamination route has fees based on entity size. e.g., large companies pay 12k, while &quot;micro entities&quot; pay 3k). I&#x27;m hoping, but not holding my breath, that eventually the fee structure will change; but given the popularity of post-grant proceedings, I can&#x27;t imagine the PTO pulling the plug on a solid money maker for them.

But you don&#x27;t have either problem with this situation.<p>Just have each peer generate a random number of sufficient length.<p>So, roughly. When you need more random numbers:<p>1) Have every client generate a random number of sufficient length and publish a cyyptographic hash of it.<p>2) Wait for everyone to ack that they have every hash<p>3) Everyone publishes the random numbers.<p>3) Every client verifies that everyone&#x27;s random numbers match the hashes, and computes the final random value as the xor of everyone&#x27;s random numbers.<p>As long as the random numbers generated by the clients are long enough / actually randomish, this should work.<p>AFAIK, this is secure. A client cannot delay until after they know other peoples random numbers, as it&#x27;ll stall at step 2. A client cannot find someone else&#x27;s random number from their hash, as inverting the cryptographic hash of a random number of sufficient length is infeasible.<p>About the only concern with this is spoofed network communication.

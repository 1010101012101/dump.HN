Though perception is not the same thing as caring about your perception. Being perceived as assholes (and enablers of child labor, pollution, etc) doesnt stop men from striving to be CEOs of huge international conglomerates. I do believe that there is a societal issue with appointing women as CEOs of existing enterprises (rather that women being CEOs/founders). This fear may be founded in &quot;can this woman rise to the sufficient level of asshole necessary to always make shareholder-value-enhancing decisions?&quot;. maybe it is the higher morality of women (a good quality by anyone&#x27;s standards) that acts as a glass ceiling in business.<p>> A hundred years ago you could have easily claimed that women shouldn&#x27;t have the vote because of tens of thousands of years of biological differences. What makes that argument any different to this one?<p>no one is preventing women from giving up raising a family to dedicate themselves to business. i doubt that the disparity between male and female CEOs can solely be accounted for by oppression or the perception that &quot;trying isnt worth it because i&#x27;m a woman&quot;",1407189509

8134276,comment,8133835,8133835,5,0,TeMPOraL,,,"> <i>I&#x27;ve found myself thinking about the database as just another data type that has an API: the queries.  The queries return values of some type, which are represented as some object in the program. By moving away from thinking of the objects in my application as something to be stored in a database (the raison d&#x27;être for ORMs) and instead thinking of the database as a (large and complex) data type, I&#x27;ve found working with a database from an application to be much simpler. And wondering why I didn&#x27;t see it earlier.</i><p>Exactly. ORMs feel to me like a result of trying to stick together two different abstractions with a duct tape and hoping it will save us from writing code.<p>The two abstractions would be:<p>- #1 Database as &quot;just another data type that has an API&quot;, i.e. what is stored in the database and what are your business objects are <i>two different things</i> and should be explicitly separated. ORMs break this by Active Record pattern.<p>- #2 Database as invisible persistence layer that automagically stores the state of your business objects, in the same way as garbage collector automagically takes care of reclaiming unused memory. ORMs break this by leaking SQL all over the place.<p>Getting #2 and not having to deal with RDBMS explicitly would lead to a great simplification of code, however we seem to be nowhere near that with current libraries (I heard some rumors that some Common Lisp Metaobject Protocol magic can get close, but I need to see this with my own eyes). So until that time I try to stick to abstraction #1. I do use Active Record, as it simplifies things, but try to explicitly avoid treating ORM objects as business objects.",1407189334

The Cocoa API&#x27;s are the big learning hurdle for iOS development and they are the same with Swift. Once you under stand the basics of the language, after building a couple of projects in it you will be up to speed. I see the sentiment that learning languages isn&#x27;t hard here all the time and it&#x27;s mostly true. If you know the fundamentals of programming and the API&#x27;s well a new language shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.

With the caveat that all growing systems gather warts, and yes, it&#x27;s nigh upon impossible to keep your data de-normalized at scale with sufficient complexity, an ORM coupled with a decently designed schema is an unbeatable combination. Not only do you get fast development, code re-use, and easy benchmarking but you also get all the knowledge and expertise that&#x27;s been baked into the ORM. Most ORM&#x27;s now come with miles of security features built in, and are able to infer and optimize on complex queries and joins better than your average non-DBA developer (assuming your data size isn&#x27;t in the millions of rows, per table, with < 3 tables to join... aka 90% of all queries).<p>Of course general solutions sometimes can&#x27;t match up with tightly coupled, highly optimized, extremely specific hand crafted SQL, and duh, making things easier can encourage bad practices, but that&#x27;s just parroting tautologies and ignoring all of the benefits you get with an ORM. In fact, good ORM&#x27;s will even provide tools to allow you to construct custom queries in the same scope as an ORM query, allowing you to have your cake and eat it too. Why would you throw out the baby with the bathwater when you can just rewrite your most egregious 10% of queries in SQL, while allowing the rest of your app to merrily chirp on?

So don&#x27;t map them that way! What we need is a low level abstraction layer alongside the ORM.<p>The main problem with raw SQL is that what you really want is a genuine programming language. You almost want programmatic access to the SQL AST, so you can generate syntax as opposed to concatenate strings together. Kind of like a DOM API, but for SQL.<p>Let me give you an example from what I&#x27;m working on now. So let&#x27;s say you have a generic query for fetching monthly aggregated import / export values between countries. Sometimes you want to filter by one country. Sometimes you want to filter by 10 countries. Sometimes you want to use the column containing the inflation-adjusted value instead of the regular column. Sometimes you want the average export instead of the total export.<p>With a low level abstraction layer, I can do stuff like already_complicated_query.filter(another_param==5). Or I can write a function that does get_world_trade_aggregate(country=&quot;USA&quot;, aggregate=&quot;average&quot;) and it&#x27;ll generate the right query for me. But then that&#x27;s not even all, if I have to modify or filter that query further in some other part of the code, in some unexpected way totally doable. It&#x27;s less often that I have to write a whole new function or duplicate code.<p>So the point isn&#x27;t the abstraction, it&#x27;s the fact that it makes queries modifiable and composable, which is something you just can <i>not</i> have in raw sql. So given a query, I can decide to add something to it or change it without having to change the text based SQL. You know how it&#x27;s good practice to split your 1000 line function into smaller, modular pieces? With this you can do that with your ginormous SQL query too. AND it&#x27;s (well, almost) guaranteed to generate correct and safe SQL.<p>This also makes everything much more maintainable. E.g. If I change table names or migrate fields, often it&#x27;s a non-issue and there is a single place I need to change that. But with raw SQL you have to go in and do a ctrl-f and hope you catch everything, but often you don&#x27;t because someone decided that that field name should come from a variable or something.<p>Raw SQL spits into the face of everything we&#x27;ve learned about programming languages in the past 60 years.<p>Anyway, the neat thing is that this magical system exists, as the SQLAlchemy Core (<a href=""http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/core/tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/core/tutorial.html</a>).

Maybe I haven&#x27;t worked with big enough data sets, but to me that number seems insanely high - and I really don&#x27;t see how the ORM would be any worse than raw SQL - if they were equally optimized.<p>It sounds to me like best practices SQL are being compared with worst practices ORM. Now many ORMs, by default, may lead a developer to use bad practices, which I will concede is a problem.<p>But in optimizing a query with SQL you only select necessary fields - and don&#x27;t use any more joins than required for the data you need - you only gain over the ORM if you didn&#x27;t limit the scope of the object you asked the ORM for and instead asked for the full object.<p>> Attribute creep and excessive use of foreign keys shows me is that in order to use ORMs effectively, you still need to know SQL.<p>Well there is your problem! Thinking you can completely ignore the underlying database mechanism of an abstraction layer is a little naive - if you want to maintain maximum performance. Though bad marketing of some ORM&#x27;s may claim differently which is a problem as well.<p>I agree, there is a potential downside to ORM&#x27;s. Raw SQL likely will get you better performance almost 100% of the time. Is that necessary? Well, it depends.

However if you&#x27;re essentially doing a SELECT * and JOINING on all related tables just to get one field from the Users table - then the SQL will win hands down.",1407188134

8134170,comment,8133835,8133835,66,0,terhechte,,,"I used to write raw SQL for many years, then, around 2005 switched over to ORMs in order to be able to target different databases, have a nice model, etc. Lets be honest here, the ease of justing doing:<p><pre><code>    p.username = &quot;Carl&quot;\n    p.age = 33\n    p.save\n</code></pre>\ninstead of &quot;update users set username=:username, age=:age where id=:id&quot; has a ton of advantages. For one, some sort of syntax or type checker is actually trying to understand your queries and makes it easy to find typos <i>before</i> the database laments in the middle of a huge transaction. Strongly typed languages are even cooler here (most notably Slick for Scala, which has a fully type-checked DSL for database querying which makes it really difficult to create typos) [1].<p>However, the downside of this is that it only works as long as whatever you need from your database is the lowest common denominator of database features. I&#x27;m currently working on a Clojure + Postgres project and I&#x27;m using all the bells & whistles that Postgres has to offer: HStore types, Json Types, subqueries in subqueries, Upserts, functions, etc. I have a rather complex database that I&#x27;m running analytical queries against, and using an ORM for this would simply not work. I&#x27;d spend half my time trying to figure out how to implement a certain Postgres feature in -insert-or-name-here. I actually started with Korma [2], a simple Clojure ORM, and gave up because it was too tedious trying to figure out how to get it to correctly run my 4-function column result query.<p>I&#x27;ve since switched to YeSQL [3] which follows a very interesting idea: You write queries in .sql files (full editor support, jay) and tag every query with a name. YeSQL then reads these .sql files during compile time and dynamically generates clojure functions with the correct amount of parameters based on these queries. It is kinda the best of both worlds. Example:<p>queries.sql:<p><pre><code>    -- name: get-users\n    -- a function to retrieve the user by name\n    select * from users where username=:name\n</code></pre>\nclojure.clj:<p><pre><code>    (defqueries &quot;some/where/queries.sql&quot;)\n\n    ;; now I can do:\n    (get-users &quot;carl&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nI think it really depends on the use case. If the database model is simple and there&#x27;re no crazy database technologies in use, I&#x27;d rather go and use an ORM again I guess.<p>[1] <a href=""http://slick.typesafe.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slick.typesafe.com/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://sqlkorma.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sqlkorma.com/</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://github.com/krisajenkins/yesql"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/krisajenkins/yesql</a>",1407188108

8134092,comment,8133103,8133103,2,0,yason,,,"I think that the road design is a key factor in how fast people drive, not limits.<p>Wide lanes, one-way streets, and cleaned-up sides without obstacles encourage driving faster while narrower passes and trees/bushes on the side make you naturally slow down. On a road or street well designed you would drive at the limit even if you didn&#x27;t know what the limit is because the limit is set to the &quot;natural&quot; speed of the road. This is what I believe is behind the sergeant&#x27;s thinking.<p>On residential streets, a very narrow design would be the first thing to do in order to slow down automotive traffic and make the street more pleasant and safe for pedestrians. There are streets where it&#x27;s nearly impossible to drive faster than 10 mph, so there are really no practical limits for speed governance in road design.<p>Conversely, on highways even astonishingly high speeds can be reasonably safe such as on German autobahns. Highways are mostly protected against the worst accidents such as head-on-head collisions. Things usually go wrong when someone disrupts the traffic flow by unattentive, blind lane changes. This is a completely different safety assessment than what&#x27;s in effect on the streets of populated areas.",1407187317

This architectural design afforded us the ability to maintain our (very high) cache-hit ratio, even when we outgrew the total slab size of a single varnish node.<p>That ability to maintain the same cache-hit ratio, the motivation for this effort, is the result of not needing to evict cached content prior to TTL.<p>So, if you have a low cache-hit ratio due to eviction (and you don&#x27;t just have excessive TTLs), then your cache pool is probably too small.

On the right lane you have the trucks which are limited to 90 km/h by law, so that&#x27;s the maximum speed you can usually drive on that lane. Now most highways only have two or three lanes. No speed limit usually results in a difference of at least 40 km/h between lanes and always-changing speeds because of traffic. Driving in a small car with a low-power engine is no fun at all, your only choices are getting stuck behind trucks at 90 km/h or a constant speeding up, slowing down, switching lanes and pushing your car to its limit.<p>My personal theory is that this is one of the main reasons why German drivers are so aggressive.

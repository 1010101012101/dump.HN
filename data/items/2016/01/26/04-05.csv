Having a VM manage everything in a resource/power constrained environment is a crazy idea in the first place. Oracle&#x27;s JVM is competitive because of heroic engineering, <i>in spite</i> of Java&#x27;s design -- not because of it. And it still has tradeoffs, like insane memory usage. ART/Dalvik are operating under different constraints, which probably contributes significantly to Android&#x27;s handicap.<p>That can&#x27;t be the whole story though, because C# and VB.NET both (seem to) perform decently under a managed runtime on Windows Phone. Wonder how big of a role the CLR has in typical WP apps and the WP core, as opposed to unmanaged C/C++ code.",1453784363

What I mean by &quot;culture&quot; is the widespread notion (cargo-cult?) among Java programmers that adding more classes and abstraction is always better, almost like a &quot;best practice&quot;, leading to &quot;enterprise&quot; monstrosities with deep inheritance hierarchies and ridiculous amounts of indirection to accomplish the simplest of tasks. The low consideration given to memory management in general (there&#x27;s a GC, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you should abandon all thought about memory allocation --- an analogy I like to use is how it&#x27;s possible to get as good fuel economy with an automatic transmission as a manual, with the right technique) also contributes to the bloat.<p>The JVM itself has a certain amount of unavoidable overhead, but even if it was e.g. 10x slower than native code at best, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the main problem. I&#x27;ve used systems that were more than 10x slower in benchmark-terms and had less than 1/10th the memory, yet felt much more responsive and performant.

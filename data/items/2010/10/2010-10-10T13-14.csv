I don't really care if the article was pro Oracle or pro HP or pro you.  Wasn't my point, and still isn't.<p>The point I raised was that hiring a CEO that was involved in that mess shows really poor judgement on the part of the HP board, they had internal candidates that were far better choices IMO, and they do this.  Another bad decision.<p>My point was all about the HP board.<p>And in rereading the article, I suspect that the author shares my point of view.  It's not that it is a pro-Oracle point of view, it's a con-HP board point of view.  I don't care about Oracle, I grudgingly respect that they wring every dime of profit they can out of whatever they do but I've had friends work there and from what I can tell it's a pretty crummy place to work.

It is as if he is ignoring the advice in his older post about making software usable.<p>Instead of having a simple text format that is the configuration, he encourages everyone to write their own. I can imagine the fun now on a mailing list - debugging n+1 languages to start a webserver.<p>When you deploy, do you deploy the sqlite database file or the script that generates it? Does the daemon check if the db is out of date on startup? Does the script clear the existing db when it runs? Does it have merge logic?

I'm debating that you need to have the entire DB in RAM to get good performance.<p>Most of the time, less than 10% of your DB represents the active working-set of your data and a good database-system should be able to analyse what is being used, gather statistics about the data, use those statistics to intelligently optimize your queries and minimize the need for disk IO.<p>For any decent RDBMS, having to match total memory with the database size, is wasting money on RAM for very little extra gain in performance and this doesn't really make much business sense.<p>A concrete example would be a server I manage. It has 16GBs of RAM and handles around 5000 GBs worth of DBs. Due to a good RDBMS and intelligent caching and use of statistics, that server has a cache-hit ratio of 98%. That means that only 2% of queries entering the system results in actual disk IO.<p>In order to get the last 2% of queries to get into RAM, I would have to increase the system memory by a factor of 30. At that point just getting another server and setting up replication would be much cheaper and also allow a theoretical doubling of troughput.<p>Really. Having the DB all in RAM is not something which makes marginal sense at all when you compare it to the costs it involves.

People who aren't linguists try <i>The Language Instinct</i>; people who aren't physicists pick up Hawking or the popular lectures of Richard Feynman; lots and <i>lots</i> of non-historians read popular histories (think: Stephen Ambrose); and I wouldn't be where I am today if it weren't for writers like Martin Gardner who labored to translate mathematics for young, unspecialist audiences.<p>And then we have programming.

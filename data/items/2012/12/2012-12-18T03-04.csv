I think trying to describe spirituality in such a bracketed, mathematical way is a smidge like trying to describe an emotion with an equation.<p>It doesn't describe what spirituality means to oneself -- which, from person to person, can mean many different things.<p>After all, isn't spirituality really all about personal meaning?",1355802996
4935981,comment,4932196,4932196,1,0,u2sonderzug,,,"Looking at this from a different point of view maybe altogether, one of the big issues I think concerning HTML5 mobile web apps (not used in a native app wrapper to get included in the appstore) is <i></i>discovery<i></i>.<p>Where do I actually find compelling mobile web app user experience when I am trying to solve a problem in my web browser as a user when I search using a search engine?<p>I noticed a few years ago that Google cut out their mobile only results option - and now when you search for anything on a smart phone you get a mish mash of mobile friendly and conventional web optimised results. For a little while there Google would put a little mobile icon next to mobile optimized results - but that has gone too. I know perhaps the point of mobile is moot now - since we have a sizeable amount of tablets accessing websites too. But just in my own personal research all my friends who aren't techy say they much prefer sites that look right on their 'touch' (be it mobile or tablet). For instance, is there even such a thing as a 'mobile web app store' out there?<p>If consumers had an easier way of finding great mobile web apps perhaps this would grow this channel? I'd be interested in perspectives on this - maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way.<p>I'd also like to make the case that I think HTML5 will continue to make a very important contribution moving forward - why? Because as we get more devices, it's really starting to get silly how many apps I constantly need updated and feel like I need syncing. I think as prices come down we will find ourselves with several devices for home, out and about and at work - using the 'fat client' model of installing all these apps just gets annoying.",1355802987

Mail, or you could switch to Fastmail.fm, or whatever else. But when it's a proprietary social network, you can't switch (in practice), because all your friends and followees are on Instagram - not the other thing that you switch to.<p>When services interoperate using open, decentralized protocols, competitive pressure helps keep a lot of the ugly stuff out of their Terms of Service. We all win. But with Instagram, or Twitter, or Facebook, one company has a complete monopoly on a particular combination of (functionality + approximation of social graph).

The mechanism necessary to do it in the straightforward way - a constitutional amendment - is almost impossibly difficult. Perhaps a roundabout mechanism would be easier.<p>If that sort of thing was allowed by the courts (it isn't), similar end-runs around the constitution could be used to do things you might not be so happy about. The fourth amendment, for example says people have the right to be ""secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures"". It doesn't say anything about tapping your phone or using a laser microphone on your window, but the courts have held that it means a warrant is required to do those things just as it is to search your house.<p>It's much easier to change policy than mechanism.

For instance, there is an algorithm called RESPA that is used to break integrations of different types of particle interactions into appropriate timestep intervals.

For instance, A(t) can be position or momentum.  The Liouville operator must be symmetric in order to generate a reversible numerical integration algorithm.<p>The result of all this is basically that:<p><pre><code>    p(t + t/2) = p(t) + t/2 F(r(t))

4935920,comment,4931575,4935445,2,0,betterunix,,,"While it is true that AES was designed with practicality in mind, that is not what the difference between a theoretical construction and a practical construction is about.  The theory of cryptography is based on complexity-theoretic arguments (or in some cases, information-theoretic arguments) about cryptographic constructions, essentially showing that any algorithm that can be used to violate some security property of the system can be used to solve some hard problem.  For example, in the case of the Goldwasser-Micali system, any chosen plaintext attack can be used to solve the quadratic residuosity problem efficiently.  On the other hand, there is no such proof for AES; the evidence in favor of the security of AES is heuristic, based on a combination of statistical tests, resistance to known attacks on block ciphers, and other measures that have been developed over the past few decades.<p>This is not to say that AES should not be trusted.  AES is a fine cipher, it is efficient, and unless someone can show us a practical attack the heuristic evidence is pretty strong.<p>Now, as for Merkle puzzles, that system is not considered secure by cryptographic standards.  A cryptographic construction is not secure unless it requires the adversary to do work that is exponential in some parameter in the system (the security parameter), while parties that know some secret (such a key) only do work that is polynomial in all parameters of the system.  In the case of RSA, for example, parties that are aware of the secret key must do work that is cubic in the security parameter, while the adversary must do work that is exponential in the cube root of the security parameter.  Whether such systems actually exist is still an open question, as it turns out; a positive answer to this question would imply that P does not equal NP.  Cryptographers generally assume certain truths about complexity theory, beyond the P vs. NP problem, and cryptography research has actually opened new areas of complexity theory that are based on such assumptions (such as the notion of knowledge complexity, which emerged from the work on zero knowledge proof systems).",1355801884

Oh dear. This is what happens when your design perspective is limited to the past few years of popular UI design.<p>Flat design was not invented by designers at tech startups. The concept was not popularized by Microsoft. Yes, there has been a recent trend away from the use of shading, texturing, and depth cues. It is a resurgence of something that began much, much longer ago.<p>Who invented flat design? Maybe Josef Mller-Brockmann, 1951? El Lissitzky, 1932? Dribbble users may not care about these names, but the current seasonal trend toward formal simplicity is little more than a rediscovery of the 20th Century's defining graphic design aesthetic, Swiss Modern.<p>If you're interested in the history of design, and understanding modern visual design in a broader context, I'd suggest Philip B. Meggs' A History of Graphic Design. For something a little more readily available, you might also want to take a look at Guity Novin's History of Graphic Design.

Upon connecting, you get pushed a page that says ""Want to share my bill? Send me a message with this form"". The message then gets passed on to you, and then you can go walk downstairs and chit chat, or whatever. This way your neighbor can message you without requiring internet to do so, as wifis.org does. (And then, naturally, put your actual internet on a different WPA2-protected SSID.)",1355800562

Is it like the 10 Commandments that have been passed down from the sky and now we have to worship it unquestionably? There are large numbers of people in this country that seem to believe so.<p>So take the gun issue. Why is that in the constitution? For hunting? Protecting from bears? Foreign invaders? Maybe. Would it make a difference now if anyone attacked us if we all carried guns? Probably not. We'll probably use our drones and tanks to fight back. Maybe it was for people to protect from an abusive government? Is that realistic today? You'd need to be able to bear tanks, helicopters and fighter planes if this hypothetical militia is ever to even register as a blip on government's threat radar. So why even bother both defending the idea or trying to find a loophole to bypass it. Both seem rather pointless to me.<p>Are people defending themselves better with guns? Canada and other countries have legal guns and don't seem to have issues with such crimes as we saw recently. Some countries outlaw guns and experience much worse violence. Is there any credible study that shows a linkage between legal arms position and violent crime?",1355800240

He said that the one tool he wished he had access to was predator UAVs like the ones they had in Afghanistan, because the amount of ground it could cover in one flight was huge compared to troops on-foot (or even in ground based vehicles). He had hooked up with a Melbourne based aviation engineer to design a UAV themselves, with thermo imaging equipment etc. The problem for me was that it was essentially a radio controlled plane, complete with the buzzing sound of the little nitro engine.

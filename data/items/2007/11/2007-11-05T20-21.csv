76373,comment,76269,76269,0,0,cstejerean,,,"imagine if instead of typing amazon into the google search box you had to type ""site to buy and sell books"", and instead of Amazon you got back Half.com<p>Google did not invent a new way for people to search, they took the way people were used to search and made it return more relevant results. I believed Powerset was bound to fail from the beginning. the problem is when folks search for email, for files on a machine, for files on P2P networks or for web pages on Google they use the same keyword based method.<p>It might certainly be useful to have a semantic search capability for some obscure searches but that would work better as a Google add-on (and with all the engineers Google has in-house if building such a technology was worthwile they would do it).",1194296052

I'm not sure if I would call Loopt a Web2.0 startup, but I agree with the point about Justin.tv<p>The problem however is that a good number of startups that call themselves web2.0 companies are building facebooks apps, Yet Another Social Network, or roll your own web app with Ruby on Rails in 15 minutes.",1194295694

Seems like a classic, frothy social app.  And yet beneath it are very difficult technical problems and horribly tedious negotiations with carriers.  Or Justin.TV.  What could me more frivolous, right?  And yet to get it to work they had to build their own CDN for live streaming.  They spent 6 months working round the clock building infrastructure (including custom hardware) before they could even launch.",1194294134

It is a true hell.  %90 of development time ends up being spend on fixing device specific issues, or workarounds for the wildely different and crappy implementation.<p>Now, you don't have only J2ME, but also Winmo, Palm, Brew, Symbian.... Blackberry  flash mobile,  all require differnt set of expertice.... it is hell people.  <p>I envy server side guys.  When you hear people b!tching about IE/Firefox javascript problems, i can't help but roll my eyes.  Mobile dev. is 10 times worse.<p>I have sweared long time ago, that my next job wont be in Mobile dev.  Maybe, if Google Android is good, and picks up steam, I might change idea.

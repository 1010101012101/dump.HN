Ideally, the affected range of spectrum wouldn't exceed that specced amount, but electronics aren't perfect, and RF is a tricky matter.<p>In practice, you tend to see splatter near a particular channel, outside its allotted frequency range. Furthermore, receivers have to filter out any signal not within the frequency range for the channel they want to watch, but the filtering circuitry (called a bandpass filter) will tend to cause distortions within the intended frequency range the better they are at filtering frequencies outside that range. There are also other complicating factors, like signal overloading receivers, and mis-tuned transmitters.<p>This resulted in a margin space between channels, so that adjacent channels would interfere with each other less. As receiver electronics have gotten better, more selective and more error tolerant, these margin spaces became less necessary, and we have space in the spectrum that's no longer required for its original purpose of providing a margin.<p>That space is your 'whitespace'.",1285271250

Gold, silver or platinum, or a spread of all three.<p>Right now, were in a high inflation environment, with the interest rates being forced down below the inflation rate. This is very similar to the scenario that created the housing bubble, only there is no longer a mania in housing.  We have an ongoing sovereign debt crisis in europe, most of which is not being recognized and an even bigger one in the USA which nearly nobody recognizes, and hasn't even started yet.<p>This means that the dollar is poised to crash, interest rates will have to rise sharply, and both of these are very bad for bonds.  Stocks will rise in an inflationary environment but this is really due to the decline in the value of the dollars used to price them.<p>I'm sure I'm going to be down voted for saying this because it is popular to believe that inflation is low (by changing the baskets of goods to pretend prices aren't going up) and that the ""recession is over"" etc. Etc. It is popular because it makes the government's job easier and the government wants to just print money like never before without consequences.   But there are always consequences.<p>I've been around a long time, and when I was 25 I was not wise enough to save.  If I'd bought stocks then, it would have been a good investment,  but having many hears of investing experience now and having studied investing and studied economics, I have learned a thing or two.  After I made a killing from knowing the housing market was going to implode, I got out of every asset with counter party risk. I've done better than %25 a year holding the ""dumbest"", least fancy investment you can- bullion.   Meanwhile, the derivatives bubble is just getting going, with one of the largest bubbles being in paper gold, btw, such as etfs.  Buy physical gold, silver and platinum, and hold onto it for a couple years.<p>2008 was the rough equivilent of 1929. We're just now entering the first part of the truly great depression.  If you do want ot invest in stocks anyway, make them Canadian mining companies or canadian royalty trusts.  Two reasons- commodity based businesses will do better, and thevcanadian dollar will do better, so assets in Canada and priced in canadian dollars will provide some protection from the decline in paper money.<p>We have about 90 years of inflation that the us has managed to export to other countries.  This means we've benefited from low cost of living by exporting our inflation abroad for a very long time.  This only owkrs, though, when you're a major industrial power and the other countries want to finance your debt because they believe you will be able to repay it.<p>The US has recently passed the levels where repayment is traditionally considered viable, and has inly increased the rhythm of the printing presses...at the same time we are longer the manfuacturing power we were.<p>This is going to be a very painful crisis.",1285271164

1720899,comment,1720555,1720555,0,0,johnnygood,,,"Rails is based around the idea that the simple cases don't need a lot of explanation to the computer.  So, let's say that you have an Article model.<p><pre><code>  class Article < ActiveRecord::Base\n  end\n</code></pre>\nThere's no need to do things like 1) tell it which database table to use; 2) tell it the setters and getters you want.  Those can be inferred.  Well, it's called Article so it'll use the articles table and we're going to want a setter and getter for each column.<p>Now, that can be overridden.  You can call set_table_name to explicitly tell it to use a table, you can add additional methods, you can override the default setters and getters, etc.  That's the idea behind Rails. You need a programming language to describe the decisions you're making that affect how your application works, but for a lot of things you're doing the same thing over and over and there's no reason to keep doing the same thing over and over.<p>Let's say that you wanted to (by default) order the articles by their creation date:<p><pre><code>  class Article < ActiveRecord::Base\n    default_scope :order => ""created_at DESC""\n  end\n</code></pre>\nYou've now defined some business logic so that when you call Article.all, you get them in that order.  On the models, you can define any amount of logic you want by creating instance or class methods.  In fact, all of those fancy keywords are just mix-ins - method calls that add methods to your class.<p>This is why it looks like Rails is lacking a bit of business.  When you call belongs_to :apple, the belongs_to method gets executed as the class is interpreted and that belongs_to method is something like:<p><pre><code>  def belongs_to(associated)\n    define_method associated do\n      associated.to_s.camelize.constantize.find(send(""#{associated}_id""))\n    end\n\n    define_method ""#{associated}="" do |val|\n      send(""#{associated}_id="", val.id)\n    end\n  end\n</code></pre>\nNow, it's more complicated than that (since belongs_to adds some additional features), but that's the basic premise.  You have this foreign key association and, most often, it's a simple association where you want to define a setter and a getter for that association.  So, the belongs_to method takes the name and pops out two methods based on that name.  The first is the getter and it makes the name you input into a camel-case and gets the constant with that name.  It calls the find method on that constant and inputs the foreign key value to the find method.  Likewise, the setter (setters in Ruby are methods that end with the equals sign) and sets the ""name underscore id"" attribute on the model to the id of the associated object.<p>But you could just as easily define the methods yourself in the Article class rather than using the helper mix-in. Likewise, if you have business logic that doesn't fit in with what's already made, you can define any methods you want on your model classes.<p>The same goes for controllers.  Controllers can be pretty small.  If you're just trying to get the latest 10 articles, there isn't a lot you have to do - you need to fetch them from the database and store them in a variable.  This is another one of those areas where Rails doesn't ask you for things it can assume.  Instance variables (which start with the ""@"" symbol) get passed to the template, local variables (which have no prefix) don't go to the template.  The template that gets rendered is the one named ""controller/action"".  Of course, you can override that and call render :template => ""xyz/abc"" if you like.<p>I'm sorry if this seems a little all over the place, but I'm not sure what kind of business logic you're looking to implement.  If you give me an example, I can provide some insight.  However, from what you've said, it looks like you've just seen the basics of what models can do - and that's because a lot of the intro code is ""let's build a blog"" where there isn't a ton of business logic.  But you can make any methods (class or instance) you like to do things to your data.  Rails creates the basic cases for you - because the basic cases are well-understood.  However, you can make them more complex:<p><pre><code>  class Article < ActiveRecord::Base\n    def title\n      if Time.now.day == 1 and Time.now.month == 4\n        return title.reverse\n      else\n        return title\n      end\n    end\n  end</code></pre>",1285269112

It took some time to find an instructor in New Mexico, but it was possible.<p>Now I have to ask the same question many have asked me - why Sweden?",1285268677

I can't think of any ill that can come from this, beyond a bit of discomfort, and I can see plenty of upside.<p>Being public means public conversation. It's not always fun but it's a cost of doing business.<p>I'm reminded of a conversation I had the other day with a friend. This guy is very senior and has been around the bay for 25 years. His kids went to school with Steve Jobs' kids.<p>At a graduation, my friend observed all these people coming up to Steve Jobs, introducing themselves, and otherwise being a nuisance during a family event. Jobs' body language clearly communicated how little he enjoyed this.<p>This is a cost of doing business.<p>The other side of it is that Apple gets millions of dollars of free press attention every single year, thanks to this one guy's personality and visibility. Their buzz is tremendous every single time they launch a product. Jobs pays the price of this.<p>Clearly a more extreme example, but this is what comes of successful visibility. Some of it is great.<p>Some of it is posts like this.<p>But it points to one thing: patio11 is doing it right.",1285268573

I remember a time when all my friends were on myspace and suddenly everyone switched to facebook. The reason was facebook loaded instantly and you didn't get spammed by bots trying to make money off you. These two things are becoming increasingly less true of facebook today and I can feel the attempts to make money on facebook becoming more intrusive and more insulting of my intelligence.<p>Also as Cory Doctorow has pointed out, the inherent of value of a social network decreases over time the longer you use it [<a href=""http://craphound.com/?p=1961"" rel=""nofollow"">http://craphound.com/?p=1961</a>]<p>It's possible for facebook to become a real success but they need to figure out the difference between creating value and making money and not try to make money by destroying value.

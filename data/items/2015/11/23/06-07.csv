Not that this stopped any identity warriors, ever.<p>The reason humans actually have words for categories (like &#x27;cats&#x27; or &#x27;policemen&#x27;) is because said categories are important and indeed allow for generalizations.<p>Meanwhile things that lack verbal categories (&#x27;people who wear socks&#x27;, &#x27;people who have funny-looking ears&#x27;) precisely lack them because language bearers have never had the need to invent a verbal category as there wasn&#x27;t much generalizing to be done about these groups.<p>Likewise looking at children&#x27;s use of words is idiotic because they are @#$% children - ie they lack any sort of life experience. Jewish israeli children (just like arab ones) have no need to categorize people into Arab/Jews because they are not dealing with all the crap their respective adults have to contend with.

10613241,comment,10609796,10609796,0,0,kr4,,,"If you&#x27;d like to read yogic prospective on depression [0] is a good start. [1] is a book on the same by the article&#x27;s author Om Swami.<p>However, let me warn you that this will venture you into concepts of human body you have likely not heard of and which has not been studied extensively by modern medical science. However, it&#x27;s heavily researched and applied at least for thousands of years in India etc.<p>>>>\nDepression is a state of mind. It is not a physical ailment; it is not a neurological disorder and it is rarely a malfunctioning of the brain. It is strictly a condition of the mind. And mind pervades your whole body and beyond. It is for this reason that pacification of the mind calms the whole body just like its restlessness upsets the whole system. Severity of depression can be ascertained from the symptoms of the patient. While I am using the term patient, that truly is an oxymoron. There really cannot be a “patient” for depression because it is not a “disease” that one can suffer from. It is simply a mismatch of the colliding psychic imprints (vāsanā) also known tendencies of the mind. Mind cannot malfunction for the true nature of mind is pure bliss (ānanda) and beyond all subjective characterizations and dualities (dvanda).<p>....<p>A pertinent question: what causes depression? Depression is a state of mind. It originates in the causal body. The mind has become a victim of its own latent tendencies. It can happen from curbing your desires or an unfulfilling life, both of which are caused by ignorance of the conditioned mind. A lot of people lead an unfulfilling life; some choose to ignore the voice of the soul while many others drown it in material pursuits. But, one day it catches up.<p>....<p>If you are not taking anti-depressants currently, half the job is already done. Please do not start taking such pills. They are soporific substances designed to artificially pacify your brain creating the illusion of a calm mind. Gradually, their dosage needs increasing as your brain gets used to it.<p>To not only completely get rid of depression but feel fitter than you have ever been, you need to cover all three aspects: body, consciousness, and the soul.\n<<<<<p>0: <a href=""http://omswami.com/2011/10/depression-definition-cause-and-cure.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://omswami.com/2011/10/depression-definition-cause-and-c...</a>\n1: <a href=""http://omswami.com/2015/08/when-all-is-not-well.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://omswami.com/2015/08/when-all-is-not-well.html</a>",1448261598

10613232,comment,10610478,10613195,0,0,zackchase,,,"Hi Ian,<p>First off, thanks for your interest in our work! The tech is a homegrown recurrent neural network (deepx) which is available via pip. <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/deepx/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/deepx/</a>\nWe use theano for compilation to GPU and an original neural network architecture (a concatenated input generative model) to preserve the signal of auxiliary inputs (like star rating and beer category) across long intervals.<p>To run the model in reverse, we infer the probability of a category via the likelihood of a review. Because the prior over the categories is uniform (balanced dataset) and because the normalization term (marginal probability of a review) doesn&#x27;t depend on the category, we can exploit the fact that the probability of a beer category given a review is proportional to the probability of a review given a category.  In this way we&#x27;re able to make a text classifier that takes into account word order.<p>Regarding Google Analytics, we just noticed this ourselves and are fixing it presently. Concerning color, that&#x27;s a great point and I apologize for the oversight. We certainly bear no malice towards those with protanopia. In future work (and if we have subsequent versions of this paper) we&#x27;ll do our best to make the lines dotted, dashed, etc to make them more readable to those unable to distinguish reg-green. Generally, I agree with you that a black and white printing should retain all readability.<p>Thanks for your interest and helpful observations.<p>Cheers,<p>Zack",1448261270

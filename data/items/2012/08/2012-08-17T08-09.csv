There are certainly some things that are split out in separate binaries and  scripts.<p>On a Debian system, take a look at /usr/lib/git-core/ - it contains a number of additional binaries, but it's still reasonably small. And a lot of what's in there is optional functionality and stuff you can delete if you don't want it. E.g. ""git-imap-send"", ""git-instaweb"" and a bunch of other things that you may or may not care about at all.<p>The main stuff like ""git-commit"" etc. is all linked to the main binary (or not necessarily present at all, depending on your build/distro).<p>EDIT: I just compiled a statically linked ""git"" binary. Stripped it is 2.5MB. That obviously excludes the few things that are in separate binaries. Things like git-daemon weighs in at 1.7MB statically linked.<p>Some things, like git-imap-send, seems to be a bit tricky to build statically (git-imap-send barfs errors about libdl all over my screen, and I'm not motivated to figure out why)",1345193936

This looks like random debugging more than anything else. Seriously, stop. Please, just read some business books, talking about like say the 4Ps, and then try to figure it out.<p>We're over thinking the problem, and the cup of coffee analogy is a perfect hit, it is a pricing issue. We as developers don't know how to price our products. Just search HN and see how many posts are talking about pricing experiments.<p>To the post. It mainly blames three areas: customer experience, free/paid issue, and craftsmanship. Which in business talk translate to product, pricing, and promotion.<p>We first tried to fix this mess by cutting down the price of our products. Things didn't work, sales still going down. And what did we do? Rinse and repeat. We kept doing that until we reached the bottom price, which now seems to be free. Newsflash, the problem stills there.<p>Worse, to stay in business the only option we had was to keep cutting down on other areas. The candidate picked for the next round of random debugging was the product itself. Quality development costs money, so product quality had to suffer. As a result we've got this endless sea of crapware we see in the AppStore and elsewhere.<p>That has led to another round of random shooting at business bugs. The next victim is promotion, or in other words, software craftsmanship, which is an attempt to fix the image problem caused by the race to the bottom. It won't work! People don't care about all the sweat and tears that we put into our work, they just want to save money. And thanks to us, they're all doing that.<p>In the end the problem remains, and we still have to go the the source in order to make the right decisions to fix this mess. The shareware business model sure would be an easy fix, but it won't happen. Another solution, if you aren't in SAAS or IAP, is to raise your prices and pull out the free products. Some developers have done it and they have gotten good results.<p>Finally, people spend four bucks on a cup of Starbucks coffee because they need the kick to wakeup and go about their life. If you figure an app to do that, please don't sell it for one buck! It worths more.",1345193693

Because frankly 'big data' is becoming a just cool must use tool regardless of use cases people have these days. I've even seen data sizes as small as 10 MB being considered for bid data use cases. Often this gets subjected to a monstrously complex architecture for no good reason.<p>Generally most of these cases can be addressed and solved with as simple a tool like sqlite! And all you generally need is something like Perl with sqlite and ability to write simple SQL queries.<p>People get deceived very easily, When they look at GB scale XML files they think that is what big data is. Yet most of that generally and easily goes into a traditional RDBMS. And the performance is generally is in pretty acceptable limits. Mark up eats a lot of space and data size. When converted to flat file structures like csv's, tsv's and then imported to a RDBMS the data sizes are way smaller. I've some times seen an order of 10x difference.<p>Another annoying thing is abuse of NoSQL databases.

      act of software development is right. But charging
      for copies of the same stuff (and not providing its 
      source) is not.
</code></pre>
While I understand the rationale behind this statement, it never felt right.<p>When designing a new car, a lot of money goes into research and development, money that cannot be recovered (sunken costs). However, once that's over and the assembly line is put together, the cost of creating new copies (while never zero) it definitely converges to the cost of the raw materials involved. The more items the assembly line produces, the cheaper it gets. And when buying a car, you're paying a lot more than that, because you're in fact buying a brand, not just some pieces of metal put together.<p>I also disagree on a car being ""open-source"". Assuming you can make copies of your car and give those to other people, you'll be obliterated by trademark, copyright and patent lawsuits. Also many car manufacturers are voiding your warranty if you go to unauthorized car repair shops. And if you can look under the hood, that's only because of strong consumer protectionism laws.<p>Apple has more than 50% profit margins on iPhones. Is that moral? Well, they need to earn a profit (otherwise they wouldn't be in this business) and they also need to pay the research and development costs for newer versions or for other products. And after all, this is capitalism - if you don't like it, buy from somebody else.<p>So why can't this rationale also work for pure software? After all, the developer needs the profit to develop newer versions, improvements or other applications from which you may also benefit. And again, this is capitalism. If you don't like it, search for something cheaper, or create your own.<p>RMS's principle (being paid only for creation of software, not for delivery of copies) does not work because it doesn't scale. You cannot put together an assembly line for software, like you can for physical products. This effectively means that you end up selling your time, which makes a good living, but it won't make you rich and it won't allow you to work on lots of silly things that may or may not pay off.<p>Also, only simple apps can be cloned easily. No software can currently match Adobe Photoshop, which still deserves every penny, and it wasn't for a lack of trying. I use Gimp because the price of Photoshop is too high for my amateurish needs, but I would shell out the cash for Photoshop in a heartbeat if I would be a professional photographer or designer.<p>The $.99 price tags is common just because the app stores are filled with crap, with most apps not even deserving $.99 - but create an app that enriches people's lives and even allows them to make some money, and you'll have no problem selling it for $90 or even $900.",1345193016

People would expect to pay a lot of money for coffee like that, more than at Starbucks.<p>Say I make great software, I have the best designers, work for weeks on user interface details, and make a great web site to go with it. Quite apart from the general expectation that my software should be cheap, or free, there is a logical conclusion that if my software is so great I must be selling millions of copies, and at $10 a copy I'm charging way to much. If I'm selling millions of copies I should be able to price at a volume level. In economic terms my marginal costs are near zero, and if the app is so great that it is selling well then my fixed costs should be divided by a very large number.<p>So for physical goods, the better the product, the more you can charge. For software the opposite is often true.<p>At the other end of the spectrum there is software that is not expected to sell in huge volumes, and for educated purchasers they understand that these apps cost more. Probably most apps in the app store that are priced over $20 are in this category. Apple does a really bad job of supporting these apps though, theres no mechanism for trying before you buy, so the risk factor is large. If you are in a market that is well connected though, then this risk is lowered by word of mouth feedback. If your market is not well connected then you have a problem convincing users of your value.<p>We were in the top paid iPad apps category briefly with an app that was priced at $49, but our market for that app is small. We choose that prices based on an estimate of selling only hundreds of copies, to a user base that had already paid thousands of dollars for the required hardware for the app. We were competing against a $3 app at that time, but our assumption was that price would not be a large deciding factor for our user base, and we were right. We could invest more in the product because our price was realistic (I think) whereas our competitors had very little money to reinvest. They had to sell 15 times the volume to make the same revenue, in a small market, and that didn't happen.<p>Actually, what happened for the most part was that customers bought both apps. We got $35.00 from each customer and our competitor got $2.50. Once the purchase was made the price was mostly forgotten, it was the reliability and features that mattered from then on. If you do have a high priced app you'd better make sure that it works well.",1345191343

This vision was sold to us by Dean Allen who had an enormously positive reputation as one of the very best early bloggers. Funding TextDrive with these lifetime accounts was not just us chumps buying into some bottom-feeders marketing scam. There was real intention and integrity behind this.""<p>* principle over actual experience<p>* a blogger over someone with actual knowledge and technical expertise<p>* an undefined ""fair price""<p>* an expectation that comfortably exceeds the current delivery levels<p>* intention and integrity<p>And what you ended up with is a typical shared hosting company experience, one that lasted a whole lot longer than a large number of other web hosts.<p>I can't help but feel that a large number of people would be happier if Joyent went down in a big ball of flames suddenly, rather than an orderly and planned 60-plus day notice of a shutdown of their service, in favour of focusing more on a better and more sustainable business model.<p>Businesses grow, industries grow and change. There's not much of a sustainable business in shared-hosting, the margins are too razor-thin got that, the middle and top end has been chomped off by affordable VPS offerings. Lifers seem appalled they are effectively paying the same price as everyone else.<p>The rest of your post seems to be on a personal crusade against the technical ""co-founder"". Why not the original blogger co-founder who promised a service he could not work with someone to deliver?",1345190420

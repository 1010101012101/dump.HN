Yes, even if you're not making the games. My guess is that they get away with it because so many people want to work in gaming at any cost.<p>Yeah, I still think about hacking a game together from time to time. The emerging casual gaming market is pretty fascinating. One of the alternate ideas on my YC app was a game.",1192172287

The guys behind it are really smart, and I'm lucky to be able to learn from them. <p>If you're interested in game development, the single best thing you could do is hang out in the IRC channel #gamedev on the server irc.afternet.org and learn from them. There are a surprising number of excellent developers in that channel, so even if you're not interested in game development you'd probably find it worthwhile anyway. Just wait for an interesting conversation.",1192171340

While the voice explains the purpose of the site quite nicely, you need a tagline and a clear written explanation as well: if the user doesn't see the value proposition in 3 seconds, they're gone (and what if they have their sound off?)<p>I also like the fact that you don't have to register to use your site.<p>I'm afraid the collaboration and social aspects are somewhat lacking - you should focus on those.<p>I can see the market for your site, but do you have a solid business plan to monetize it?<p>(long time fan of zombo.com)",1192171262

Reporters love new factoids. <p>What I see work, over and over again, is companies manufacturing surveys or studies that come up with numbers and metrics about the market, like, ""20,000 enterprises are deploying technology to stop the Storm worm"". Some companies will do annual press releases about an official-sounding report they generate, like, ""Weboopia's 5th Annual Twitter Study Concludes 4,897,489,281 Messages Delivered Over Twitter In 2007"". \n",1192170217

The more we treat children like fragile little eggs, the less able they will be to carry the torch.  <p>Who said that children shouldn't be anxious?  Was there ever a single moment in world history where children had nothing to worry about?  Fear of real danger is as healthy a thing as I can think of.",1192169818

When I want to go to a local business, I don't <i>fly</i> there.<p>It always amazes me how geeks will ooh and aah over any 3D interface. But the three-dimensional world is extremely inconvenient for conveying most sorts of information -- there's occlusion and perspective, which hide and distort information. The one thing a 3D map does convey is the height of buildings, and sometimes the shape, but it's not clear that this is worth the costs. <p>Even if it were true that 3D gave you more useful information, there are no interface standards for 3D navigation.<p>Full disclosure: I work for Upcoming (<a href=""http://upcoming.yahoo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upcoming.yahoo.com/</a>), also in the events and local search business. But honestly, this isn't me slamming the competition; I have ranted about 3D interfaces for years. I think UpNext is impressive, but maybe there's more appropriate uses for this technology than local search.",1192169811

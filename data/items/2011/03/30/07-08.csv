[Palem] and his students simulated a PCMOS circuit that would be part of a chip for processing video, such as streaming video in a cell phone, and compared it with the performance of existing chips. They presented the work at a technical conference, and in a show of hands, much of the audience couldn't discern any difference in picture quality.""",1301471444

That's a fair question as we're seeing a lot of other companies put their resources in the smaller 7""-9"" screen market (Kindle, being the most popular if you consider it a tablet).  Not sure I buy it, but with that statement he's not saying <i>all</i> tablets.<p>Secondly, I'm minded that everyone in the mainstream world thought that the NetBook was the next big thing - and that market has practically evaporated (in the Western World, at least).  Same could happen to tablets, especially like NetBooks they don't actually replace an existing machine but instead try to create a new tier of need.<p>For Microsoft their biggest market is still enterprise and I'm yet to be convinced tablets have a massive value there given that we're seeing tablet usage orientate around content + information consumption not productivity.<p>Ultimately, however, I do think this is a foolish decision if it represents Microsoft's official position - they just cannot afford <i>not</i> to hedge their bets and have something in the tablet market even if they think the future is ultimately gloomy.",1301469927

Didn't work.  Got some strange error message in a popup window.  It looked like the text of the error message was being truncated (like it was flowing off the screen or the popup window wasn't large enough to accommodate the text or similar).<p>This got me wondering - are there any helpful automated tools out there that enable an Android App Developer to test his app across multiple popular devices / multiple OS versions / multiple permutations of each device?  Maybe something like Browsershots.org, but for mobile devices?  Ideally <i>not</i> an emulator, but screenshots from an actual device.<p>If Amazon can't get it right, is there hope for any of us?<p>P.S. I'm new to Android App Development",1301468759

Because they don't eat sugar! The latest studies show that a prevalence of sugar in our diets is what turns LDL cholesterol into its artery clogging form. BTW LDL cholesterol is also needed in our bodies. However, if we eat sugar it causes the LDLs to break down and attach to the arterial walls. These aren't outliers, just real world examples of how people around the world have eaten for years without developing diabetes and becoming overweight.",1301468447

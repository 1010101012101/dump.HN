Read below:  <p>""In particular, you don't need a brilliant idea to start a startup around. The way a startup makes money is to offer people better technology than they have now. But what people have now is often so bad that it doesn't take brilliance to do better.<p>Google's plan, for example, was simply to create a search site that didn't suck. They had three new ideas: index more of the Web, use links to rank search results, and have clean, simple web pages with unintrusive keyword-based ads. Above all, they were determined to make a site that was good to use. No doubt there are great technical tricks within Google, but the overall plan was straightforward. And while they probably have bigger ambitions now, this alone brings them a billion dollars a year."" (How to Start a Startup)<p>Sure, search engines sucked (algorithm-wise) before Google but the concept/idea of a technology to aggregate links by relevance, was pretty critical to Google's existence, IMHO.<p> ",1189370542

52544,comment,52501,52535,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"Yeah, I think the recent quality of submissions to the site have suffered - at least if you measure them against the name of the site - 'Hacker News'.  It seems that voting by itself doesn't weed out non-topical stuff.<p>Perhaps this could be fixed by asking the submitter to reconsider if the link they are about to submit really has anything to do with hacking or entrepreneurship.

To paraphrase the writer, light pollution is bad for a lot of reasons, but mostly because the night sky is simply too beautiful not to protect.  I find that sentiment really charming.",1189368628

Also, soon I will begin to feel the full effect of passing up the best opportunities for building a relationship with a good woman.<p>Perhaps if I had funding then it could have been a little better, maybe not. Having to do the very best in anything is very expensive.<p>Oh, and you're majoring in painting? Man, I really wish I had that luxury. (seriously, I'm not trying to talk down.)",1189368268

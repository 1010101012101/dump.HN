Avoiding press is very easy, just don&#x27;t do the journalists&#x27; job for them. :)",1413892790

8486877,comment,8483102,8483102,0,0,dockerhubby,,,"The Docker hub is - after such a short time - an even darker place than the wordpress plugin registry and is already a source of security problems and a useless waste of bandwith, time and effort. Besides too many amateurs publishing BS, the real problem is that the company behind this is not taking responsibility to assure the quality of their containerized-app-store. This does not have to end in censorship, like our beloved Big Brother Apple does - some automated checks on each uploaded image could be a way to go plus a team of reviewers, that approves everything uploaded. Of course, the amount of information attached to any image currently is a joke, the whole hub is a one-day-of-work prototype that never should have been published in the first place in this premature state, but now it´s too late, so there is no other way than burning it down and restarting it with some more thinking before.<p>Much better concept would be: share layers, not images, based on verified base images with preinstalled saltstack. This effectively boils down to sharing good and up2date provisioning scripts.<p>There are some more conceptual problems with the whole docker idea that are rooted in a &quot;need-to-productize-quick&quot; infected thinking and do make everything seem immature and not really thought out - very basic problems that pop up with orchestration and networking should have been solved before releasing the product, now millions of half-assed &quot;products&quot; step into that gap and the result is a bizarr level of overcomplication of any infrastructure that was not possible before with virtualization alone, and still there are important things that &quot;will be contributed in the future by somebody, hopefully&quot;.<p>Docker should not be a product itself with it´s own &quot;market&quot;, but the basic docker ideas should be added to already existing concepts and inherit already existing infrastructure. The docker execution model should be a standard feature of any linux distribution with a standardized container modell (with some security added!) and the existing packaging infrastructure should be extended to handle what is needed to support it, including userspace updates and provisioning or on-the-fly rebuilds, so people can concentrate on writing provisioning scripts and not fighting another layer of system config BS. Getting rid of the VM is great, but building even more complicated overhead is totally absurd. Meanwhile something like Vagrant is a great thing to learn from.",1413892443

Every decision has potential legal consequences, so anyone making such a decision has to have clear criteria for making it that will stand up in court.<p>Companies don&#x27;t give referrals any more for the same reason - making any judgement about an ex-employee is potential grounds for legal action (the next employer can sue because they hired the person on the basis of your erroneously good referral, or the ex-employee can sue because of your bad referral).

Whilst I was living there, I shared an apartment with 3 other people, the landlord and 2 other chinese guys which were sharing their room. In fact, most of the younger foreigners I happend to hang around with shared apartments, and I wouldn&#x27;t be suprised at some of them sharing rooms either. The only guy under 25 where I&#x27;m certain that he had his own flat to live in had a mother who used to work in real estate. Proably the most cramped situation that was described to me by an expat involved a girl that i met in one of the cities posher nightclubs who came to Beijing to find a modeling job, who was sharing an apartment with 5 other girls. Presumably, they did share rooms. And this is foreigners that came to Beijing despite of that. I cannot imagine how cramped some of the BeiPiao (Chinese migrants coming to Beijing) are willing to live just in order to stay in the city.<p>So if you&#x27;re young, unmarried and you&#x27;re not incredibly fussy about living together with other people, I think you should absolutely go for it.

The Summerhill school has been around for decades and is successful, and probably inspired all of the schools discussed in the article (the book was published in 1960). It optimizes for pyschology --- not pedagogy.  This is why it is free: freedom but not license, which to Americans, would be better stated as: an environment without submission and without domination (so, as opposed to an anarchic school, teachers are not submitting to arbitrary demands of children). A healthy degree of assertion develops in this environment. I&#x27;ve seen Sudbury graduates describe this type of school as a generator of entrepreneurs --- they start businesses afterwards and become successful (although from the Summerhill point of view, success is having a happy and flourishing life). I&#x27;ve found many papers across the years, while researching this topic, that, added together, support the idea that learning is affective and pyschology should be an organizing principle of the school.",1413890396

There&#x27;s no general process to achieve that, which is why it requires ingenuity :)<p>SPOILERS BELOW<p>To do that you have to notice the common factor in the initial equations.<p>Let n1, n2, and n3 be number of chickens sold pre-lunch time by each farmer. The initial equations are:<p><pre><code>  n1*x + (10-n1)*y = 35\n  n2*x + (16-n2)*y = 35\n  n3*x + (26-n3)*y = 35\n</code></pre>\nTransforming them a little:<p><pre><code>  n1 * (x - y) + 10y = 35 ;[1]\n  n2 * (x - y) + 16y = 35 ;[2]\n  n3 * (x - y) + 26y = 35 ;[3]\n</code></pre>\nThe common factor of (x-y) looks useful; you can establish relationships between n1, n2 and n3 with it:<p><pre><code>  (n1 - n2) * (x - y) - 6y = 0  ;([1] - [2])\n  (n1 - n3) * (x - y) - 16y = 0 ;([1] - [3])\n\n  (n1 - n2) =  6 * (y / (x - y)) ;[4]\n  (n1 - n3) = 16 * (y / (x - y)) ;[5]\n\n  (n1 - n2) = 3/8 (n1 - n3) ;[6]\n</code></pre>\nIf you get there the puzzle is basically solved but for a bit of number crunching - you know n1, n2 and n3 are positive integers, n1 <= 10, so for [6] either n1=n2=n3 (trivial 0-post-lunch-price solution) or n1 - n2 = 3, n1 - n3 = 8. From there you substitute back into [4] and get 3 * (x-y) = 6y, so x = 3y.<p>You now have simple relations between n1, n2 and n3; as well as between x and y. The remaining step is to tie x or y to one of the n&#x27;s by substituting into initial equations. For example from [1]:<p><pre><code>  n1 * 2y + 10y = 35\n  2y = 35 / (n1 + 5)\n</code></pre>\ny must be integral in pennies; that part is tricker to derive and the simplest solution is to just notice that since n1 >= 0, and n3 >= 0, and n1 = n3 + 8, then 8 <= n1 <= 10, and try 8, 9 and 10 for n1. With n1 = 9, you get y = 1.25. That&#x27;s the only &#x27;guess and check&#x27; part of the problem.",1413889384

6246835,comment,6243627,6246444,3,0,kevingadd,,,"My PoV is that even if you have the hour or so that it should take for an average candidate to arrive at Floyd&#x27;s algorithm or something, is that really the best use of the hour to screen the candidate? If your goal is simply to see whether they can solve problems using linked lists, that&#x27;s noble, but making a candidate spend the majority of an interview trying to arrive at a solution for a new problem from scratch is a questionable decision, especially if each person in the interview pipeline is going to do the same thing with another problem.<p>For reference, the first time I saw the cycle detection problem it was in an interview, and I had to derive Floyd&#x27;s algorithm myself. It indeed took about an hour, so your estimate&#x27;s probably not that far off. The problem is that it&#x27;s the least optimal environment to solve a new problem for the first time without any assistance or context, which is what you&#x27;re basically requiring. The candidate is basically left swimming in the deep end of the pool and you watch them flail around and at the end of it, maybe they&#x27;ve come up with a solution to the problem. Maybe they&#x27;re really close and haven&#x27;t hit that flash of inspiration yet. Maybe you accidentally misstated one of the problem&#x27;s constraints and they&#x27;re never going to figure it out as a result. Pretty lame.<p>For basic stuff like reversing a LL I agree that no reference is needed to work out the optimal answer, but on the other hand I strongly believe those questions are worthless as a way of evaluating competence. The kind of LL stuff I&#x27;ve seen in interviews skews much more heavily towards Floyd&#x27;s than simple stuff like list reversal, most likely because the simple stuff is easy.<p>A good interviewer can certainly detect that a candidate just isn&#x27;t familiar with LLs, and move to a different problem. I think that&#x27;s an adequate method too: Attempt to screen out the people who aren&#x27;t competent at logic and recursion and similar concepts, but without filtering out people who have just never been exposed to a particular class of problems.<p>On the other hand, if you think having a candidate flail around for an hour (whether they solve the problem or not) is a good idea, there&#x27;s no convincing you otherwise. I just think it&#x27;s a pretty poor choice if your goal is to make the candidate and interviewer come out of the experience looking back on it positively with lots of useful information.",1377035560

Yet the spinner feels faster than no feedback, and the progress bar feels faster still. Watching that bar fill up makes the time seem to pass faster.<p>And the progress bar is totally fake. In fact, it doesn&#x27;t even take 10 seconds to fill. It fills in 9.2 seconds, starts out fast and slows down, and none of this has anything to do with what is really happening, which is that you&#x27;re waiting for a 10 second timeout to fire.<p>My point with all of this is that in order for a progress bar to fulfill its duties as a time condenser, I suspect that it needs to be prominent.

I wouldn&#x27;t adopt this strategy.<p>Instead, assuming it truly is &quot;minor,&quot; I&#x27;d own it.  Write a blog post about how your past has made it harder for you to find work.  Talk about what you did, specifically, and all your feelings about it then and now.<p>Don&#x27;t name names of companies, but perhaps share some (anonymized) stories.  Whatever you do, it can&#x27;t sound like sour grapes.  You have to be magnanimous to the last drop.  You have to swallow every last bite of indignation you have.  You need to say and believe things like, &quot;If I&#x27;m honest with myself, I can understand why Company X made the decision they did even if I felt they handled it inappropriately and ultimately made the wrong decision for the wrong reason.&quot;<p>Try to tie it into a larger story, perhaps raising questions about whether the tech world is really a meritocracy, e.g., &quot;Silicon Valley is a Meritocracy, Unless You Broke the Law as a Kid.&quot;  Maybe try to reach out to other folks who have had similar experiences, e.g., &quot;Are you an engineer whose past makes it hard for you to find work? You&#x27;re not alone.&quot;<p>The response on this thread alone should be good enough evidence that folks would be interested in the story.<p>This will do a few things.

How stupid of people to reject a candidate for those reasons; let&#x27;s interview him.&quot;  The latter will go, &quot;Holy shit!

If you can combine this with good personality, social skills and integrity, then you will definitely be appreciated. Almost always there will be some smart people around to notice you.

Don&#x27;t wait silently, show your contribution, but don&#x27;t overdo it. Job security is an illusion, don&#x27;t go after it. You will probably receive fair compensation eventually.

There was this  idea for an Android app that I had - a food-related Android app - that did not exist in the market. There had been a few attempts but nobody had done anything concrete in the direction that I was thinking of taking. I pitched the idea to a few developer friends and found that the idea seemed to excite almost ALL of them. Unfortunately, none of them could spare me the bandwidth. Frustrated, I finally decided to take the plunge myself and created a prototype using Google AppInventor to knock up a very shoddy-looking app that was served with a Django-Python -TastyPie backend running on a free Heroku instance.<p>Since then, I have gone on to indulge myself with a few other projects:<p>1. Hashpix - <a href=""http://hashpix.herokuapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hashpix.herokuapp.com</a><p>2. @updt_me - <a href=""http://update-me.herokuapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://update-me.herokuapp.com</a><p>...and a few more in the pipeline.<p>Now, we come to the most important question: Do I have offers related to my programming &#x27;expertise&#x27;? Well, no. Seeing as how my experience in the field is next to none, I find that my skill set has few or no takers. Does it make me happy? Hell, yes! Does it scratch my entrepreneurial itch? Well, somewhat. None of these ideas are making me any money, you see. Does it put food on the table for my family? Abso-fucking-lutely not. I&#x27;m pretty sure it won&#x27;t put any food on the table until I reach a good enough level of expertise - something that I am sure is (at least) another few hundred thousand lines of code away.<p>Long story short? If you have the bandwidth, the energy, the ideas, the time, the inclination, the burning desire and MOST IMPORTANTLY, the savings in your bank account to scratch your entrepreneurial itch, go ahead and take the plunge. Otherwise, wait for a while, build up those zeros that follow the $ sign and THEN take the plunge.<p>Of course, the standard universal disclaimer applies: YMMV.",1377033746

6246631,comment,6243627,6243627,1,0,abalone,,,"Ok, the RealTimeCounter problem got me thinking. It&#x27;s a great question. It seems very simple, but as the author notes even PhD&#x27;s are stumped by it. Here my solution.<p>One very important purpose it serves is to see how well you can identify problems in algorithms. Probably I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s not even important that you get it perfect, just that you can recognize and talk through the challenges.<p>One challenge relates to understanding the requirements. It needs to return the count for the preceding period of duration N, whether N is a second or a day. It could and usually does start in the middle of the preceding second, day, etc. It&#x27;s a constantly moving window. That means if you just reset the counter each time you pass the absolute boundary of the next N (1:00, 1:01, etc.), you lose accuracy.<p>So that suggests that you might have to track each individual increment() somehow. But there&#x27;s the next challenge, memory usage. If you just store all the timestamps, that&#x27;s linear memory growth every time increment() is called.<p>So it seems to me like the solution is a tradeoff between memory usage and accuracy. If you don&#x27;t call increment() very much or have a lot of memory, you can get perfect accuracy.<p>So that&#x27;s the &quot;theory&quot;. Now here&#x27;s where it gets more interesting from an engineering perspective. Optimal implementations. Here&#x27;s what I came up with in about 15 minutes.<p>First you minimize memory usage by storing offsets instead of the complete timestamp. Do this in 2 arrays, one for the preceding interval and one for the current one. This makes it easy to exploit our knowledge of when we&#x27;ve crossed the interval boundary, e.g. via now().getSecond(), to clear out old data.<p>(I am only considering one type of interval like seconds here.. you could extend this to minutes, hours, days by duplicating this method, or perhaps theres some way to consolidate more optimally.)<p>Anyway, increment() takes the offset from the fixed start of the current interval, i.e. the nanoseconds since the start of the current second, and appends it to the Current array. It also checks if we&#x27;ve passed into the next interval, in which case it reassigns the Current array to the Preceding array and starts a new Current array. The getter functions also do this.<p>To get the count, the getter simply<p>1) Finds the nearest offset in the Preceding array to the current offset (could just loop over it, start in the middle, etc.)<p>2) Subtracts that index from the array length to count the number of in-scope increments from that preceding interval (this works because the array is naturally sorted)<p>3) Adds that to the length of the Current array (because everything in the current array is in-scope)<p>SO, that should be a pretty fast way to do it with minimal memory requirements. If memory&#x27;s going to be a problem,<p>A) you could spend a little more computation to do a kind of garbage collection. In step 2, resize the array to clear out the out-of-scope indexes. (Maybe you&#x27;d want a more optimized kind of data structure than a vanilla array for this.)<p>B) reduce accuracy by quantizing the offsets.<p>Ok am I hired yet? I&#x27;ll go wait by the phone.<p>Just kidding, I&#x27;m sure this is wrong in many ways. But the point I&#x27;m trying to make is that it&#x27;s a great problem for exploring tradeoffs, yet easy to understand what&#x27;s being asked and requires no special technical knowledge.",1377033298

6246574,comment,6236478,6239541,2,0,dalke,,,"(Yes, this is part II. I got interested in the topic.)<p>I empathize with the difficulty of defining &#x27;educated person.&#x27; As you rightly point out, there are different threads in what an &quot;education&quot; means. <a href=""http://www.educationengland.org.uk/history/chapter03.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.educationengland.org.uk/history/chapter03.html</a> goes into the three main groups - &#x27;public educators&#x27;, &#x27;industrial trainers&#x27;, and &#x27;old humanists&#x27; - which participated in that debate, ending &quot;The curriculum which evolved during the 19th century was &#x27;a compromise between all three groups, but with the industrial trainers predominant&#x27; (Williams 1961:142). This was &#x27;damaging both to general education and to the new kinds of vocational training&#x27; (Williams 1961:143).<p>For purposes of this discussion, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to refine the meaning of &quot;educated person&quot; specifically to &quot;expected from someone who has graduated from a liberal arts college.&quot; I think this definition works for most of the last 500 years of having liberal arts colleges, up until the mid-1900s.<p>My definition specifically excludes religious and industrial education, which I think is appropriate for the intent.<p>Now, I noted that the Elements book I pointed to was meant for &quot;elementary&quot; students. I <i>think</i> that means up to age 12 or so. It&#x27;s definitely no later than what the 1868 Taunton Report proposed:<p>> first-grade schools with a leaving age of 18 or 19 would provide a &#x27;liberal education&#x27; - including Latin and Greek - to prepare upper and upper-middle class boys for the universities and the older professions;<p>(vs. second- and third-grade educations meant for the middle classes and lower.)<p>So the two pieces of evidence I have, for why someone in 1913 with a liberal arts education (an &#x27;educated person&#x27;) would have likely studied the Elements is first, the two forewords for a text book meant for &#x27;elementary&#x27; students, and second, the number of reprintings of the text book, which implies that many were published.<p>I can now add more data points. In &quot;THE RIVER WAR: An Account of the Reconquest of the Sudan&quot; by Winston S. Churchill, 1902 edition, from <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4943/4943-h/4943-h.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4943/4943-h/4943-h.htm</a> :<p>> The whole journey by rail from Merawi to Dakhesh occupied four days, whereas General Hunter with his flying column had taken eighta fact which proves that, in certain circumstances which Euclid could not have foreseen, two sides of a triangle are together shorter than the third side.<p>Why would Churchill use this reference if the readers, educated in the mid- to late-1800s, are not expected to understand it?<p>There was a big debate in the UK in and around 1902 about the teaching of Euclid.<p>In Google Scholar&#x27;s preview for &quot;SOME RECENT DISCUSSION ON THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS&quot;, WW Beman - School Science and Mathematics, 1903 - Wiley Online Library &quot;I may add that the address was given in full in the Educational Review for February, 1902. This discussion of the teaching of mathematics in England particularly with regard to the retention of Euclid as a test-book of geometry is by no means a new one.&quot; See also a letter in Nature <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1902Natur..66..103S"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1902Natur..66..103S</a> pointing out that Schopenhauer was also critical. And a 1903 Nature followup at <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1903Natur..68R...7P"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1903Natur..68R...7P</a> saying &quot;I WILL not deny that some reformers desire to abolish Euclid and establish another sequence of propositions in abstract geometry for schoolboys .. Two per cent. of schoolboys take to abstract reasoning as ducks take to water, and they ought not to be discouraged from the study of Euclid, but they and all the other boys ought to study geometry experimentally, logic entering into the study just as it enters into other parts of experimental physics. If the best modern books have a fault, it lies in the absurd assumption that an experimental sequence ought to have some connection with the Euclidean sequence.&quot;<p>In <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3603959?uid=3738984&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21102568961213"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3603959?uid=3738984&ui...</a> I read a page from a 1901 paper for the Mathematical Gazette (London) saying &quot;(ii) The question of the retention of Euclid as a text-book was again raised. It was urged with considerable force that our retention of a book discarded by other nations had at any rate a presumption against it, and that it was wrong to sacrifice the interests of education to the east of the examiner. (iii) More than one speaker pointed out that if the experimental or intuitional method of introducing the truths of Mathematics, and especially of Geometry, were used from the lowest classes of our schools upwards, the strictly deductive course would not lose but gain in effectiveness.&quot;<p>So, it looks like the end of the 1800s was the death-knell for Euclid&#x27;s Elements, but it was in the UK where it hung around the longest, perhaps for another 20 years.",1377032820

(Hence, the need to follow...)<p># Why?\nWell, I don&#x27;t use twitter frequently but I do have an app on my phone. My RSS reader slowly grew into a mammoth pile of feeds that I eventually stopped caring about. My source of news these days, is aggregators and forums like Reddit and HN.<p>However, I do pay attention to my DMs on twitter. So I decided to create an RSS feed reader with Twitter as the interface point.<p># How\nWhenever you see a feed you want to follow, all you have to do is follow the user @updt_me and send out a tweet of the form &quot;@updt_me START <feed_url_here>&quot;, for example:<p>&quot;@updt_me START http://barrettsheridan.com/feed&quot;.<p>Whenever the feed has a new post, you&#x27;ll receive a DM with the link and the title of the post.<p>The site is currently running on a free Heroku instance with tweets being grabbed every hour or so.

No one is raving about Flash performance on Android.  Netflix isn't going to release a client with poor performance.  Everyone will blame Netflix for it. Of course future Android phones will run Flash fine (faster processors, more ram, whatever), but that's not a solution <i>today</i>.  The Netflix Android clients have been in development for months (see their blog posts) and will be released in the first part of 2011 (few months).  Will those Android phones that have no problem with Flash be here in a few months?  If so, how many of those will there be in comparison to the install base now that netflix is trying target?<p><i>Does anyone provide a content protection framework for Android?</i><p>See that question? It's talking about 3rd party solutions.  Not about DRM being provided by the underlying OS. Not sure why you are hanging on that point to call out Netflix's blog response as BS. Irdeto provides the content protection framework for Netflix to use on GoogleTV.  Netflix isn't requiring the OS to have one.  iOS and WM7 happen to provide their own, which is why they have clients already.  Android doesn't and no one provides one.",1289680417

But why should we think of it that way?<p>The Postal Service was originally conceived as an essential piece of national infrastructure.  Why should we think of it as an ""independent"" entity that needs to turn a profit?  Does the highway system turn a profit? How about the Federal Reserve, or the National Institutes of Health?<p>What's important is that the USPS continue to have enough funding to provide its service in an accessible, timely, and reliable manner.  That is what makes it a critical piece of infrastructure.  Like it or not, it is still essential to be able to communicate with hard copies.<p>(Why? For one thing, we don't, as citizens, all have an official electronic mail box.  Physical mail also bears information about its transport -- where it went, whether  anyone else read it along the way, whether it was delivered and read -- in a way that most electronic communication doesn't.  We don't have a unified way of finding out how to communicate with someone online, and the means we do have are all owned by private corporations that cannot be relied on to provide that information in perpetuity.  And so on.)<p>I agree that, for many things, there are ways to communicate that have advantages the Postal Service doesn't offer.  But I cannot imagine having to sacrifice what makes that service valuable in the name of making it profitable, or always having to rely on alternative services, especially for critical or official communication.  We're going to need a public post office for some time yet.  And as communication continues to move online, the need for a  reliable, public system for delivering that communication will grow even further.",1289679858

Web real estate for link-images seems easy to get once you reach a certain level of mind-share but I can't see getting image everywhere as being the same as becoming a <i>necessary</i> part of the web.<p>If taking credit cost little, every remaining store in the US would do it tomorrow. Does that mean many stores would be willing to <i>stop accepting cash</i>? No way. (well not 'till ""the beast"" slouches a little closer to ba-by-lon but I'm not hold my breath).",1289678646

Considering the foundation work is largely the longest process in the building anyway, I don't see a 6-day building time as an improvement when you've still got to wait a month or more for the foundation to be laid and cured, then you really haven't advanced much.<p>Considering that they used 6 cranes and crews working throughout the night, this was still a 18-day regular construction for 8-hour work days. Assuming the 6 cranes were performing equally and to their max this would have been 108-days of construction using a regular Western crew with 1 crane. Roughly a total 30-week construction - sounds about typical to me for non-prefabricated construction, if not rather slow in man-hour comparison and we're talking opposed to <i>unionized labor</i> which is possibly the slowest construction workforce in existence.",1289678624

If I remember correctly, he said that the bill was in response to people who would buy apartment buildings and use all the rooms to make them into an unlicensed hotel.<p>They talked with the sponsor of the bill and he said that they wanted to work with each other, or something to that effect. I haven't looked into it any more than watching his talk, so I could be wrong.<p>That's not to disagree with you, though. I find it a cowardly move, as well.",1289678576

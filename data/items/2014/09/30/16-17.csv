MDMA has always been tops in the rankings (not just this one, but DARCs and others), implying it&#x27;s been sold to at least tens of thousands of customers. If the worst MDMA would rank 1 and normal MDMA 5 and half the MDMA sold is bad (to maximize the possible impact on the rating), then you&#x27;d have to have <i>thousands</i> of people croaking after taking the bad MDMA in order to produce an average of 4.9 (to pull down the average by .1 using ratings of 1).

It has been tried and tried again, it doesn&#x27;t work. Nobody has been able to make it work, I don&#x27;t see that changing without any other variables changing. People innately want to downvote to disagree, that&#x27;s how people have proven they work.<p>> Adding more user choices won&#x27;t stop people from using the one intended to suppress inappropriate comments on comments they disagree with if they, in fact, want to suppress disagreement.<p>It will for the reasons I set out above: Flagging stops them interacting with the comment (replying, disagreeing) and a &quot;disagree&quot; is a public disapproval rather than a private one which likely suits many people&#x27;s ends better.<p>Additionally you now have more metrics (data) to measure a comment&#x27;s quality on (e.g. agree, disagree, and flag) rather than two. More data might make it easier to detect flag-button abuse.<p>> I think this rests on a false assumption -- private use of flag doesn&#x27;t reduce the incentive to use it, it just reduces accountability.<p>The upvote and downvote arrows have no more or less accountability, so I don&#x27;t follow what you&#x27;re getting at. The flag arrow just wouldn&#x27;t be recorded in the comment&#x27;s public scores, accountability remains identical (in that there isn&#x27;t any).<p>> it would be stupid to use the UI option to &quot;disagree&quot; after you flagged anyway, since that would negate the effect of your flagging on its only purpose -- suppressing the opinion you disagree with, rather than publishing your disagreement.<p>It would on paper, it wouldn&#x27;t for real people. While there are people who sit there and figure out how to best game the system, the majority just knee-jerk react to things they find &quot;offensive.&quot; So they would hit flag, then disagree, then reply with &quot;you are dumb.&quot; If we take away 2/3 of their toys if they hit flag incorrectly, they&#x27;re less likely to utilise flag and instead just disagree and reply.<p>Plus it re-focuses flag&#x27;s purpose. If you flag a comment you literally don&#x27;t think it should exist, therefore you should have no need to interact with it. Heck you could go one step further and auto-hide it for that individual user.",1412095946

A57 wasn&#x27;t actually done when Apple outed Cyclone. Apple clearly ran with early aspects of A57 (your disingenuous misreading about ARMv8 being ignored).

Indeed, nvidia and Qualcomm are just getting to 64-bit parts, doing a pretty good job with their existing architectures.<p>Apple wanted to be first, and they pounded every bit out of 64-bits in their marketing.

For example, we know that anyone who confidently and bluntly asserts that &quot;if X had been done Y would have happened&quot; is not contributing to any useful discussion. People rarely know why they are doing what they are doing today, and certainly know almost nothing about why someone else did something half a century ago.<p>We can point to things people said and did in the past and make informed judgements about the plausibility of various reasons they had for doing what they did, but again: anyone who asserts bluntly and with confidence that &quot;Japan would have surrendered if...&quot; or &quot;Japan did surrender because...&quot; isn&#x27;t helping.<p>Japan surrendered after Nagasaki was bombed. Some people think this shows that Hiroshima alone was not enough to convince the Japanese government that the new weapon would turn the tide of war against them.<p>Russia declared war on Japan after Hiroshima was bombed. Some people think this was important to Japan&#x27;s surrender, but would it have happened without the bomb?<p>Japan had a history of fighting for every inch of territory. Some people think a conventional invasion would have resulted in a rapid conquest.<p>Area bombing in Europe had a relatively small effect on the Axis war effort, and an awareness of this was growing within the Allied command. Within military circles there tends to be a feeling that if something isn&#x27;t working the best thing is to do more of it. The bomb was more of it. Thus, the ineffectiveness of area bombing in Europe may have contributed to the decision to use the bomb in Japan.<p>And so on...<p>It is worth noting that war itself is almost always strongly motivated by counter-factuals. &quot;If we just bomb the enemy they will surrender&quot; (they don&#x27;t: they become more dogged in defense until they demonstrably face total destruction). &quot;If we engage in horrific acts of terrorism the enemy will run in fear!&quot; (they don&#x27;t: terrorist organizations that employ violence against civilians have a zero--yes, zero--rate of effectiveness in achieving their goals: <a href=""http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/792/why_terrorism_does_not_work.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/792/why_terr...</a>)<p>All we can say with anything remotely resembling certainty was that the bombs did drop and the war did end. We can make some informed guesses about why both sides decided the way they did. We can say virtually nothing with any certainty at all about what would have happened if any major decision had been different... except maybe one.<p>What if Japan had never attacked Pearl Harbor? This is a counter-factual that people who are wont to make blunt, confident predictions about &quot;what would have happened&quot; had the Allies never destroyed Hiroshima or Nagasaki are generally surprisingly silent about, yet it is one of the few things that would plausibly (not certainly) have avoided the subsequent destruction of those cities.",1412095075

I spend very little of my programming time struggling with those issues, even in languages without generic types...But more important, what it says is that <i>types</i> are the way to lift that burden. <i>Types</i>.

They need to change when their usage changes (for example, when they&#x27;re used to build bigger and bigger programs) as well as when fashions shift, but when they do, they must do so carefully and conservatively. As a general rule, Java only adds new features not when they make something nicer, but only when they solve something that&#x27;s really painful.<p>I think this approach works especially well in large projects designed to last for years, made by large heterogenous groups of developers who might come and go over the lifetime of the project.<p>One language that is somehow confounding in this respect is Clojure. It is minimalistic, but at the same time it&#x27;s clever, so I&#x27;m not sure whether it belongs more in the minimalistic language category or the clever language category.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://dfjug.org/thefeelofjava.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dfjug.org/thefeelofjava.pdf</a>",1412094299

The fact that students are willing to pay for it doesn&#x27;t mean too much (IMO) as the economics and incentives of higher education (2008 downturn, skimpy state budgets, tuition grants, non-dischargeable loan debt, graduate research funding) have driven most schools to a challenging place where students are mostly choosing between institutions that are kind of mercenary, and ones that are blatantly mercenary.<p>This story comments on the University of Chicago mostly because its one of the extremes.  However, the issue is really the trend - The move to run schools like big business.<p>To gauge success by non-student oriented metrics like year-over-year recruitment growth or annual profit.  To compete for, and try to hire big shot administrators / executives (cause that $1M (Example) Harvard guy is worth 10x more than some $100k random dude).  To vote large administrative / executive pay raises or parachutes (not general faculty) while the main public story is the rapidly rising cost of tuition.  To tailor the school towards showing good metrics, rather than educating students and letting metrics flow from that.  To focus primarily on research output because its more profitable / efficient than educating a bunch of undergrads.<p>IMO, its all the problems that we&#x27;re vaguely aware exist in higher education, but the University of Chicago is just particularly egregious about it and could make Obama look bad if he puts his library in it while talking about how important educating all our students (not just the wealthy ones) is.",1412093855

Low gravity has a lot of negative health effects.<p>Mars also has nothing like the Van Allen belt, it&#x27;s bombarded with radiation that colonists would constantly need to be shielded from.<p>Mar&#x27;s atmosphere is poisonous to humans, and has a much lower atmospheric pressure, so colonists would need to have a constant protective bubble protecting them from the world they were on.<p>Mars hasn&#x27;t got liquid water.

I&#x27;m not a user of it so I can&#x27;t speak from personal experience, but the common understanding seems to be that the particular constellation of Yesod packages together hover very close to unbuildable. They are also all together quite large and rely on a lot of compilation-time tricks (template haskell) which can increase build time.<p>I think it&#x27;s unfortunate that Yesod gets billed as the premiere web framework for Haskell because it does require some extra work to get compiled.<p>In fact, the entire Stackage (&quot;stable hackage&quot;) project, I believe, was originally developed in order to get some tooling which would allow Yesod to be consistently built. If you think you&#x27;re going to be primarily using Yesod then I suggest you switch to Stackage [0]. Stackage prevents install issues by building the entire Stackage group together periodically to ensure that there are no build problems.

If something is not ready for prime time, you should signal that. Call it v 0.7, say it&#x27;s a beta, label it as a &quot;labs&quot; product. Say up front where the known weaknesses are, and say what audience you want.<p>I also strongly recommend working with a small, carefully selected audience to begin with. Typically only a small percentage of your eventual audience will put up with the rough edges of a work in progress. Getting the average audience member involved early on is frustrating for both sides. You get a lot of feedback on things you a) already know about, and b) are intentionally avoiding for now. And they waste a bunch of time on stuff that wasn&#x27;t intended for them.",1412092977

Even without Columbus&#x27;s voyage, the existence of ships capable of intercontinental travel would have led to an an encounter that would have played out much the same way: decimation of the population by foreign pathogens from a society with strong immunity due to high population density, ensuing collapse the native states that may have been able to organize resistance, looting of mass quantities of gold and silver, and mass agricultural slavery. The only difference would have been a slightly greater technological edge for the invaders.<p>Also, there&#x27;s nothing special about Europeans. If the explorers had been from China via the eastern region, the scenario would likely have played out the same way. Up until modern times, most warfare was either about power, e.g. preventing a rising rival or conquering a falling power, or extraction, where the goal was to remove as much wealth as possible in as short a period of time as feasible. Given human history, extractive warfare against the native population by militarily superior Eurasian invaders would be the expected outcome.<p>So no, I doubt the lack of Columbus&#x27;s voyage would have done more than set back the timetable a bit, or changed the players. Societies in Eurasia just had too much of a biological (germs from city density), technological, and organizational advantage.<p>That said, what&#x27;s unique about the Mars colonization idea is that we may have a limited time window in which to try it. Given that our chief sources of energy are non-renewable, we are living in a golden age of cheap production. We haven&#x27;t so polluted space for Kessler syndrome to lock us in. We even have precociously advanced space technology due to the huge boost from the USA-USSR space race.<p>Right now we&#x27;re watching our space programs atrophy. There may be a limited amount of time to get a viable off-world colony going.<p>Sure, right now we&#x27;re talking about an Antarctica-style bunker mission, the Martian equivalent of Apollo.

In many ways, Go seems to have something Pascalian lurking under its surface - WOCA with static compilation (and fast compile times), readability favored over terseness/expressiveness, and deliberately trying to limit what can be done (i.e., no pointer arithmetic) so that there is a &#x27;sane subset&#x27; by default.<p>I&#x27;ve played around with Go (worked through the Go Tour and implemented some trivial site scraping/JSON client stuff).

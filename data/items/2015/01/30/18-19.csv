8973667,comment,8972766,8973533,0,0,nationcrafting,,,"You make some good points.  I think the solution has to be one that looks at the state as a service provider.  Until the issues have been depoliticised, decisions will be made for political reasons rather than good business reasons.<p>As a service provider, the state has 2 sources of revenue, primarily: private customers i.e. people, and corporate customers i.e. companies.  Both those customer groups pay for services in the form of taxes.  Now, those customer groups must be, by and large, wealth creators for there to be any wealth that can be taxed or even redistributed (if that is your political inclination).<p>So, it simply won&#x27;t do to just reform the state, to spend less, etc.  A system has to be put in place rapidly that boosts wealth creation.  This includes: minimal bureaucratic lag in the creation of new companies (Chile, for example, enables new company creation within 2 days), very low taxes, easy interaction with regulation bodies, a business-friendly environment, etc.<p>If the state is too sclerotic to reform, it can be set up through free-trade zones in isolated parts of the country.  This was China&#x27;s route, when they essentially replicated Hong Kong in Shanghai, Shengzen, and all the other FTZs.  It allows to you to be ultra-reformist in small experimental areas without putting at risk the power structures that exist in the state at large.",1422644220

8973662,comment,8973023,8973433,0,0,beslinger,,,"Very much agree with the second point. And not just how it relates to the actual project work, as a freelancer, you also need to be prepared to do a lot of things that aren&#x27;t development. Tools and consultants are available to help, but invoicing, insurance (if applicable, depends on your client types), taxes, proposals, etc etc all have to be overseen by you if not actually done by you. Personally I have been fine with those tradeoffs, retaining a high degree of autonomy in exchange for some less than interesting tasks. But it&#x27;s a tradeoff you have to be willing to make if freelancing is going to be the source of your livelihood.<p>Edit to add: especially if the target client js less than savvy, they&#x27;re going to really appreciate working with a consultant who has the skillset the OP does. Frequently (and sometimes frustratingly) less savvy clients can take a very wide view of what a web consultant should be providing for them. Marketing as a product development and management guru can absolutely become a viable business as a freelancer. There are tons of other freelancers with other specialities whom you can sub to (if the budget and agreement allows) to fill out any gaps you may have in specific areas. Particularly things like design and UI that lend themselves to well-defined scopes and deliverables.",1422644174

It isn&#x27;t a required component of some entrenched industry dictum.<p>You&#x27;re registering this objection on the basis of JS&#x27;s privileged status in the browser; I&#x27;m invoking it because of The Fine Article&#x27;s comparison with JS on the server, where it&#x27;s adopted as voluntarily as any other language -- and where, yes, despite claims that event-driven/callback scattered code are worse than what Go offers, people are able to get things out the door anyway!<p>And that&#x27;s true of Node, it&#x27;s true of PHP, it&#x27;s true of Java, it&#x27;s true of most languages people have moved to Go from.<p>The claim that being able to ship in a language doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s wart-free is a pretty solid one, and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re talking about.<p>> I find it hard to even express clearly why Go feels so...natural and productive. But it does<p>Does it? I&#x27;ve been working in it for 8 months and... nope. Doesn&#x27;t feel unusually productive. But I guess your subjective opinion that you can&#x27;t explain should trump everyone else -- after all, we&#x27;re using &quot;specious logic!&quot;<p>> And one of those reasons is that the language is so simple and, well, crude, that you don&#x27;t stop and sit on questions of approach.<p>Ah, yes. It&#x27;s like Java:<p>&quot;I liked programming in Java mainly because I found it very relaxing. With a bad language, like say Fortran or csh, you struggle to do anything at all, and the language fights with you every step of the way forward. With a good language there is a different kind of struggle, to take advantage of the language&#x27;s strengths, to get the maximum amount of functionality, and to achieve the clearest possible expression.<p>Java is neither a good nor a bad language. It is a mediocre language, and there is no struggle. In Haskell or even in Perl you are always worrying about whether you are doing something in the cleanest and the best way. In Java, you can forget about doing it in the cleanest or the best way, because that is impossible. Whatever you do, however hard you try, the code will come out mediocre, verbose, redundant, and bloated, and the only thing you can do is relax and keep turning the crank until the necessary amount of code has come out of the spout.&quot;<p><pre><code>   http://blog.plover.com/prog/Java.html\n</code></pre>\n(When I started working with Go last May, I had <i>no</i> idea or expectation of the extent to which I&#x27;d have thought this article would apply.)<p>> And FWIW, when people talk about the lack of generics causing them great pain, usually they aren&#x27;t making a solution, but instead are toying with the language.<p>Really?<p>> it just...isn&#x27;t a problem.

There have been exploits against the Kernel found, and there are likely to be more.<p>Good answer, but I counter with this:<p><a href=""https://blog.sandstorm.io/news/2014-08-13-sandbox-security.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.sandstorm.io/news/2014-08-13-sandbox-security.h...</a><p>> Plus, how much effort has gone into hardening the Cap&#x27;n&#x27;Protocol bridge? Do you have a security expert reviewing the code and looking for vulnerabilities?<p>Among our advisors are Mark Miller and Jas Nagra, both members of the Google security team (though advising us in their free time, not on behalf of Google). Cap&#x27;n Proto is based heavily on Mark Miller&#x27;s previous work in capability-based security.<p>Also among our advisors is Andy Lutomirski, a kernel developer who specializes in security and sandboxing. He has been cranking out CVEs against the kernel lately. Most of them haven&#x27;t affected Sandstorm, due largely to our seccomp filter which Andy himself wrote and continues to work on (see link above).<p>My own background is diverse but includes a few years working on security at Google.<p>That said, we have not yet commissioned a thorough security review of Cap&#x27;n Proto&#x27;s own implementation. That is something we plan to do before any 1.0 release (of Cap&#x27;n Proto or Sandstorm).<p>> But not their in-memory caches. Code and shared make up a fraction of their presence in memory.<p>Depends. If the app is written in C++ or Rust, then the code is mmap&#x27;d in (with that memory being shared across instances). The runtime memory overhead tends to be very low if the app is single-user.<p>For apps written in dynamic languages that parse their code at startup, yes, memory usage is a lot larger -- as a rule of thumb, many apps use around 100MB. One idea we have to fixing this is to checkpoint an app at the point when it first tries to read its per-instance data and restore from that checkpoint on future runs. This checkpoint could theoretically be shared between all instances and mmap&#x27;d copy-on-write.<p>That said, we don&#x27;t feel this trick is immediately needed. For our upcoming managed hosting service, we&#x27;ve run the numbers and are confident that the vast majority of users will not come anywhere near hitting the resource limits we&#x27;ve set even for the &quot;standard&quot; service level, and we aren&#x27;t losing money if they do.<p>> And if we&#x27;re running potentially dozens of PostgreSQL instances on a single machine<p>For the scale of a Sandstorm app, it makes tons of sense to switch to sqlite, which mostly solves this problem. :)",1422643993

The author is completely correct that people often underestimate the fragility of predictive models, and that summary analysis (I group this into a more general concept called &quot;insights&quot;) are simpler and more robust. I think the article is a little harsh towards predictive models though.<p>The primary difference between a model and an insight is that insights require a human to process - anything more automatic is a model. Insights are easy to implement and are great for finding patterns and anomalies (the human mind is basically designed to pick these out). But the human element makes insights less scalable with significantly higher latency. For some problems these are unacceptable tradeoffs, and this has little to do with how stable a company&#x27;s environment is.

There are a couple of advantages actually.<p>- You don&#x27;t have to write logic to figure out <i>which</i> clients need to be updated with some data. You just run the queries that you need to to generate the data for the client, and then RethinkDB sends you an update only if the result of that specific query changes.<p>- Having the thing that modifies the data send the updates to the connected clients becomes increasingly difficult if you have multiple application servers. Then you would need to set up some separate message passing / broadcasting infrastructure if you also want to update clients connected to other servers. RethinkDB takes care of &quot;passing the news around&quot;, even in a distributed environment.<p>- RethinkDB supports changefeeds not just on the raw data, but also on transformations of the data. Not all transformations are supported yet (for example map reduce queries are not), but our goal is definitely to support changefeeds on pretty much any query. Just knowing that the underlying data has changed isn&#x27;t enough. In a traditional setting, you would still need to either recompute the whole query, or implement your own logic for incrementally updating their results for every type of query you want to run. RethinkDB updates query results incrementally and efficiently.<p>(I work for RethinkDB)",1422643799

An exponent less than one would imply that a system with more elements has a lesser coordination complexity than each element acting independently.  Such would only be possible if humans became telepathic when forced into close proximity.<p>3.b.  Consumption per person would be equal to the usable  output of each person, minus overhead losses, minus stockpiling and savings.  Assuming the latter to be zero, consumption is x = sigma N^0.5 - gamma N^2.  To find minima and maxima, we take the first derivative with respect to N, and find where it is zero.  0.5 sigma N^-0.5 - 2 gamma N = 0.  The non-imaginary solution is N=(sigma/4 gamma)^(2/3).<p>3.c.  Plug N=2 into the above equation.  To support cities of that size, gamma must be less than 9% of sigma.  Sigma may be increased by gains in productivity, such as with specialization.  Gamma may be reduced by lowering coordination burdens, such as by using money instead of barter, or employing merchant specialists.  Changes in gamma have a greater effect on city size, so given the equal-cost choice between a universal education mandate and a guaranteed uniform currency standard, the latter is preferable, if larger cities are desired.<p>If student economists cannot think their way through that problem, we may assume that they will have a detrimental future effect upon both sigma and gamma, and we should therefore kill them now before they cause our cities to collapse.

Unfortunately China has growing up now a &quot;forgotten&quot; generation of young men who outnumber women their own age over 2:1, and what has history taught us societies do with a bunch of unhappy young men? Kill them in wars.<p>So while China might not be invading India or the US, there still might be a civil war if this bunch of unhappy men decide to turn on the government to force &quot;change.&quot; That too would be a threat to world peace, as an unstable China is bad for everyone.<p>I think Russia&#x27;s recent aggressive stance against Ukraine is worrying. But we&#x27;ll have to wait and see if this is an &quot;isolated incident&quot; or some part of a USSR-mini-reformation. However the social makeup in that region of Ukraine (where many of the people living their speak Russian and want to be Russian) might be a unique one off rather than a specific change in Russia&#x27;s overall international stance.<p>Let&#x27;s also remember ISIL (&quot;ISIS&quot; as the US calls them). A group of mostly young poor men rampaging through multiple states because they feel their own governments have let them down, and are unhappy with the US&#x27;s interference in the region and or drone strikes (that sometimes kill civilians, often with even an apology or investigation by the US).<p>Yes, there is a religious element to ISIL&#x27;s increase in popularity, but it is often quite interesting to look at the social economic situation that allowed extremism to bread rather than simply looking at the extremism and pretending it gained popularity in a vacuum.<p>I general I suspect you&#x27;ll see the US get involved on the ground with ISIL, you&#x27;ll see the Ukraine situation simmer out with the Russian&#x27;s holding the occupied land, and you&#x27;ll see some major national or international incident with China in the next 15-30 years.",1422642871

Ironically that was for cost, like switching from 3rd party to (finally) a home grown php tool to replace the Saas $200 fee.<p>Essentially, what we&#x27;re seeing from my team&#x27;s perspective are the culmination of a few trends that started being bigger back in 2003, when I first worked from home full time for about six months, prior to joining Yahoo at giving up the lifestyle for a few years. With nearly ~6.5 years in WFH experience; I&#x27;ve done it nearly half my professional career.<p>Those who can make it work, do it the way in the article, there&#x27;s no option, only pain, to that process. It broke up a 12 year business partnership I had, in the end, written goals were broken, therefore, I ejected. Simple, straightforward and asynchronous. There&#x27;s a movement, tempo to when a team is producing. My CTO and I are incredible partners this way, and we spend less than twenty minutes per session &quot;Talking,&quot; because he&#x27;s even more introvert than me, it seems.<p>At the end of the day, team&#x27;s ship something. Marketers should be shipping business models, spreadsheets, powerpoints, Adwords copy, Blog Posts, Social Posts, Images, Videos and more. Engineers ship code, so, they rock and should have it a bit more straightforward.<p>Designers ship design. If the &quot;Business monkey,&quot; isn&#x27;t playing secretary, documenting things and helping others ship, OR shipping something with their fingerprints all over it, something is broken. For a production oriented individual, remote, WFH work is the most empowering kind.<p>Freedom. Run at your own pace, if the team gets slow, develop new skills, a new hobby and explore. The digital world is a vast place; for example, I&#x27;m building free, open source SaaS, running two blogs, a team, built two visual novels this month, learned Daz3d, Carrara, Gimp for animation & more.<p>I ship what and how I want, when I want & where. The team does the same, as a group, we have aligned objectives. So the business moves at one pace, and as an individual, I carve my own lane. Run ahead, scout, explore, learn and grow. Then perhaps, those skills in animation & 3d become useful to the business. Or not. Time will tell.<p>Great article, and thanks for posting your experiences. I love learning.",1422642852

The range owner explained that the weight of the thing was what made it so effective - especially in the hands of people with little training, the &quot;kickback&quot; of a normal gun would make it hard for someone without a lot of training to keep fire concentrated over a sufficiently small area, but the heft of the Thompson makes it &quot;drop&quot; back into place very nicely after the round is fired and the recoil kicks in.  Sure enough, when we pulled the targets back, mine was the most accurately shot round-for-round (no one there was very experienced with firearms), which I found to be pretty impressive since everyone else was shooting modern weapons and I had this old brick - but the range owner said that was what made the thing so effective.

And now Tsipras is arguing bluntly that Greece&#x27;s economic system will not rebound as expected because it&#x27;s productivity problems are deeper than liquidity.<p>It is worth looking at Detroit here. Not because of where they are similar but where they are not.<p>Detroit could not repay debts and required restructuring (aka hair cuts). Importantly they decided the type of hair cuts on their own. They had to do this because there was no Federal bailout. Michigan agreed to pay 194 mil for pensions as a lump some (aka a gift) but Detroit had to sell off assets, renegotiate with creditors on their own and reform where they could. But again, they did this because they knew they had to. It wasn&#x27;t directly dictated by &quot;The Union&quot; (Fed).<p>Importantly they were given some breathing room because at least some portions of social services providing stability are Federal (social security, medicare, medicaid). And though they just exited bankruptcy it&#x27;s likely without investment from overloads (state and federal) a full recovery will not happen. Or at least, investment will certainly help that become more possible.<p>What is missing in the EU are these social safe guards. And it seems a good time to build them. Rather than dictate to Greece how to alot retirement or social welfare or other social services, they should provide a baseline EU wide option for entities that default. This option makes it easier to let them get at least as close to default as is required for them to be in a place to consider what changes they could make to provide future stability. And when it comes to bailouts it should come in the form of investment. Both seem to be a rather obvious steps in maintaining the Union and providing greater trust and integration. Anything else should be decided in negotiations only after Greece begins the hard negotiations with its creditors after all accept imminent default.",1422642444

Maybe this will be solved by WebRTC, but it&#x27;s a lot easier with a server component. (Sandstorm has several real-time collaborative apps, like EtherPad, EtherCalc, and Wave. Currently you can share these apps with other users by copy/pasting the URL; the sharing model will get more sophisticated eventually).<p>* You need to set up a storage server for the apps to use, or use one of the big providers that like to do data mining. You then need to connect the app to the correct server, which is extra busy-work.<p>* The permission model of these storage servers isn&#x27;t terribly sophisticated. Often you&#x27;ll end up granting the app broader permissions that you really want.<p>* There is, of course, nothing stopping the app from storing data to other places as well, nor is there any isolation between separate documents opened by the same app. (On Sandstorm, each document is a separate instance of the app in a separate sandbox which cannot communicate with the outside world without permission.)<p>Edit: Missed that you said you&#x27;re working on RemoteStorage.

8973401,comment,8972766,8972766,0,0,netcan,,,"Europe had and has a fundamental problem in its dealing with sovereign bankruptcy, or insolvency as Alexis Tsipras puts it. The reality is that the government of a state cannot go out of business and make way for a new one. But, it&#x27;s not uncommon for states to become insolvent. State collapse is not an option.<p>The way it is normally dealt with is inflation, which is kind of treated as default by economists but not really by financial markets and law. The print money which (A) can be used to continue operating and (B) reduces the value of the debt (sovereign and private) as the currency devalues. The &#x27;C&#x27; is one that Greece really needs. It&#x27;s also one of the hated (or loved) mystery components of &quot;Keynsian<i>&quot; economics.<p>Inflation lowers salaries, and other pre-agreed contracts. It allows (for example) houses to sell at a lower (real) price without the &quot;animal spirit&quot; responses involved when someone sells a house 5 years later at a 15% nominal loss. There&#x27;s debate in pedantic circles about whether this effect is indeed emotional or if it&#x27;s related to mortgages being denominated nominally and other &quot;rational&quot; reasons.<p>Whatever the theoretically best way of understanding it (the two most vocal sides are Austrian vs Keynsian economists with actual politicians usually adopting a confusing mix of both vocabularies), it remains the case that the tried and tested (though certainly not free) solution is printing money.<p>The German solution is just to stay solvent. They manage to do it and they want other EU countries to do it too. This is a combination of strange optimism, stubbornness, fear of inflation and belief in Beaurocratic controls (which work better in German than in Greece).<p>This is the core of the issue. A State that runs its own budget (a fundamental EU principle) that does not control its own currency (a fundamental EU principle) cannot make it through insolvency.<p>One option that I quite like is letting states go into a sort of &quot;bankruptcy.&quot; The banks would have to take the hit. This means the system must be robust against bank failure (which is easier to swing than state failure, but we&#x27;re not there at this point. Too big to fail, Systemic risk, etc.) But, that doesn&#x27;t prevent the problem overall. It prevents states from digging quite as deep as their interest rates rise sharply, but it doesn&#x27;t completely block off the risk of failure.<p>I don&#x27;t really have a solution. I don&#x27;t like the Keynsian approach, but it is popular because it offers a solution to recession and state solvency at the same time.<p>We can see similar things happen in sub-state governments. US cities & States (provinces elsewhere) can go bankrupt. They are locked into spending on salaries, physical maintenance and such which require future revenues that were never realistic or haven&#x27;t been achieved for some other reason (eg migration). They control a budget, they don&#x27;t control a currency.<p>The EU needs to solve this in a way that doesn&#x27;t make it happen again. bailing out Greece with an actual cash transfer would not achieve this. It would (A) make it easier for other EU states to get into the same trouble and (B) take the pressure off Greece to do what they need to do, become solvent.<p>Greece&#x27;s governmental spending is unsustainable. Not of the currently declining tax revenues. Not on the pre-austerity revenues. Not even in a best case scenario. Inflation causing a (quite but extensive) reduction in government salaries, contracts, pensions, etc. is not an option in the EU context, but it may not have been enough anyway.<p>It&#x27;s actually quite scary. I have no idea how they solve this. I have no idea how the EU gets &quot;fixed.&quot;<p></i>I use Keynsian quite loosely. It&#x27;s only tangentially and perhaps spiritually related to John Maynard Keynes the person.<p><i></i> Printing money doesn&#x27;t always work either. Hyperinflation can destroy the State. Borrowing in foreign currency (as the poorest countries must do)  takes away the option.",1422641840

8973363,comment,8966789,8970967,0,0,Mz,,,"Thank you for your long, intelligent reply. Have an upvote.<p>Yes, I do know this (that the magnesium makes a difference). Unfortunately, I probably cannot prove it. However, I am somewhat compulsively helpful. I hate seeing other people suffer. So I foolishly continue to try to help other people, in spite of a long history of being pilloried for trying to share what I know.<p>Here is my story and how I know, which I am fairly sure won’t convince you of anything:<p>I have a form of Cystic Fibrosis, as does my oldest son. I nearly died just about 14 years ago, at the age of 35.5. Ten weeks of ear infections turned into pneumonia practically overnight when I tried some &quot;home remedy&quot; that had been suggested to me. I then spent about 3.5 months bedridden and was finally diagnosed with CF just short of my 36th birthday. I had already started looking into alternative medicine because doctors were not being very helpful. Also, given that I had lived that long without a diagnosis, I felt confident that, armed with the information about exactly what was wrong with my body, I could certainly improve on my track record.<p>The home remedy that made my condition dramatically worse overnight was acidic in nature. I have since learned that acidity promotes inflammation, CF is an inflammatory condition and it slowly makes you way the hell too acid. I thought this was a big epiphany that would revolutionize treatment of CF, but everyone already knows this. They just don’t think it is medically significant and mostly don’t bother to treat it.<p>I recently spoke with a knowledgeable person from the CF community and explained that my best understanding is that the mechanism behind CF is that the interior of the cell becomes both increasingly too acid and gets out of whack in terms of salt and mineral balance, and this is the underlying mechanism behind &quot;the normal progression of CF&quot; and reversing that is why I have been able to not only stop the progression in myself and my son but actually reverse our symptoms and gradually get healthier. It creates a positive feedback loop of the worst kind: More acidity and mineral imbalance leads to increased misfolds of proteins (including the CFTR, the defective protein in our genetic disorder) and more misfolds leads to the cell being too acid and more imbalanced in terms of minerals. It is known that the cells of people with CF hoard both calcium and glutathione, a powerful antioxidant. I believe our bodies do this as a means to buffer the cell against these chemical imbalances.<p>So this knowledgeable individual, who is well respected in the CF community and has apparently written some papers on the subject, told me “It can’t work that way. That would kill you. A cell has to maintain a pH balance within a very narrow range in order to sustain life.” I wrote back and said “Given that CF kills people, often at very young ages, I don’t think that’s a good counterargument.” She then began looking up articles that support my hypothesis instead of shooting me down. It turns out there has been actual research on this idea as far back as (IIRC) 2008 but it isn’t getting much press and isn’t being seriously pursued as a treatment modality.<p>So I have spent a lot of years talking with people with various conditions and the detail that magnesium helps with tinnitus is well known in at least one alternative medicine community. That was where I got the initial information on that. I know it to be true because anytime I throw up a lot or run too much fever, I start having issues with noise sensitivity and the like and the thing that consistently helps it every single time is eating magnesium rich foods.<p>Of course, it wasn’t as simple as just feeding my son magnesium rich foods to help with his tinnitus. We were also reversing the high acidity of his cells. This is related because magnesium is an alkaline mineral. People with CF are prone to getting osteoporosis as early as their teens. I saw some show a long time ago that indicated that life did not leave the ocean until we had bones not just for the infrastructure it provides, but because the calcium is critical to mediating the blood balance. Sharks and other sea creatures don’t need that. The mineral rich ocean water keeps their blood balance on an even keel. But land creatures need a large store of calcium to draw upon because if your blood leaves a very narrow range of pH, you die. And you die pretty darn quickly. When diabetics are diagnosed with ketoacidosis, they typically are promptly hospitalized because it can kill you within three days. (I know this in part because I worked for an insurance company for over 5 years and read medical records all day long as part of my job.)<p>So it is very well established that acidosis is a bad thing. It is very well established that CF makes you too acid. If you become suddenly and extremely too acid, they hospitalize you. But if you have CF and you thus become slowly, gradually, inexorably too acid and they know you are dying from your genetic disorder, they completely overlook the connection between this known acidosis and the fact that you are dying and if you are patient who thinks that is medically significant and something that needs to be treated as a cornerstone of dealing with the condition, the entire world will advise you that you are nuts and will do all it can to issue you a gag order and give you hell (ie if you are me).<p>So while I think the cochlear hearing loss issue is no doubt more complicated than just “take magnesium,” given that I regenerated my lung tissue and no longer have a hole in my left lung and magnesium deficiency promotes acidosis because it is an alkaline mineral…etc…etc..etc.. compressing 14 years of research and trial and error into a short post for HN comes out as a suggestion that I think that antibiotics that cause magnesium deficiency might be a clue as to what the best direction to take future research might be for this hearing loss issue.<p>However, that’s sort of an educated guess. I don’t actually know which antibiotics are known to cause this issue. I was just being stupidly compulsively helpful. As soon as I am done getting myself physically well and off the street, I plan on getting that compulsively helpful personality defect dealt with.<p>Have a great day.<p>Edit: I appear to have left out the detail that magnesium deficiency and calcium deficiency are interrelated. They work hand in hand and the body needs BOTH (plus a few other things, like vitamins D and K, which people with CF are routinely deficient in because they are fat soluble) in order to properly process them. So if you are deficient in either of them, you can pretty much bet that you are deficient in both.<p>But this comment is already overly long and it probably makes no difference how well I state my case.",1422641488

For instance, typing `cd &quot;foo&quot;` is significantly more painful than `cd foo`.  (Maybe this could be fixed by forking or adding to ghci so that when you hit space after the function name it automatically puts the quotes in for you and places the cursor between them.)  Options are certainly important, and as others have said, they can be emulated with records.  Is the syntax going to just as convenient as shell scripting?  No.  But that&#x27;s not the point.  The point is that shell scripting is massively painful in a lot of other ways where Haskell blows it away.  So the task is to find a happy medium that gets fairly close to the convenience of shell scripting while still giving us the power of Haskell.<p>There are a number of potential approaches for coming close to the ease of shell scripting.  One is options records as others have mentioned.  For defaults you can have a Default instance (no, that&#x27;s not boilerplate because you would have had to specify the defaults somewhere anyway).  Then there is plenty of room for infix operator combinators to make it easier to change individual options.  A second option could be to put options into a string that would get parsed into a record.  You could use patterns similar to those used in existing command line argument processors like optparse-applicative.  Or, if you don&#x27;t like that, then maybe a quasiquote could give more power.<p>Do these things require some boilerplate?  Yes.  We know that is going to be required since Haskell wasn&#x27;t designed for the convenience that shells were designed for.  But that&#x27;s fine in this case because the potential benefits are huge.",1422641460

It might be this article was written for a more general audience.<p>The key point I&#x27;m referring to is that many of the developments of modern databases are really expansions on ideas that were invented back in the 1960&#x27;s but have been re-invented in the distributed world, to handle higher data volumes and advances in hardware/software capabilities.<p>For example, the article overlooks (and most seem to overlook) a critical technology known as multivalue databases, which are mid-1960&#x27;s technology, predate relational systems, and share a lot in common with more recent NoSQL systems in terms of the persistence paradigms.  The main difference is that multivalue databases were centralized systems and not distributed - but data volumes were a lot smaller back then compared to the volumes we have now.<p>I bet most would be surprised to know that Pick/D3, a legacy multivalue database, was an integrated operating system, database and programming language, and that it contained a &quot;SQL&quot; like query language (without joins, aggregates, etc. - very simplistic) as well as attempts at natural language query-like utilities.  Pick/D3, in particular, lost out to the relational players in the 70s and beyond for a multitude of reasons.  That said, it and technology like it (MUMPs, for example) are still alive and running systems today.  Intersystems Cache, for example had interesting concepts that mixed object-relational mappings and SQL queries on top of a system that started as something resembling a persistent multi-dimensional array, MUMPs.<p>In the context of the history that I understand, everything is an evolution in thinking for data storage, data volumes, persistence, networking, data access techniques, etc.<p>NoSQL, for instance, is a terrible misnomer - for many such systems suffered in adoption because of a lack of a good general purpose query language (although many now provide their own forms of query languages to make working with data they store easier).  That said, having a structure which is non-relational in form has never meant you could not use SQL with it - just that some of the relational constructs do not fit as easily into those realms.<p>We need not look further than Hadoop to understand how relational paradigms can be extended to any form of data/system with the right combination of technology components (think Hive, Spark, etc. etc).<p>We are in a world now where we have a multitude of data engine paradigms, where no one model truly and completely dominates the other - they are complementary and each have strengths and weaknesses.  And we continue to get closer and closer to combinations of techniques that allow for general purpose, distributed by default, data systems/processing/storage.",1422641296

His statement &quot;Greece&#x27;s debt is currently unsustainable and will never be serviced&quot; is a typical, bold, populist statement, twisting reality. Greece&#x27;s debt would indeed be sustainable, if it wasn&#x27;t for Tsipras&#x27; recent claims that they would rehire some recently laid of government workers and stop the privatization process. The debt is serviceable, it just isn&#x27;t repayable. But that&#x27;s no problem since the ECB can always take over these bad loans, once the Greece government has fulfilled all the requirements for reform. When he says in his last paragraph:<p><i>I understand that, behind your &#x27;demand&#x27; that our government fulfills all of its &#x27;contractual obligations&#x27; hides the fear that, if you let us Greeks some breathing space, we shall return to our bad, old ways.</i><p>Then this is exactly the reason why the debt needs to be retained. Tsipras has already proven with his recent actions that he&#x27;s very tempted to return to the &quot;bad, old ways&quot; of Greece government spending. European solidarity means helping out equal partners in the union, it does <i>not</i> mean funding dysfunctional governments at the expense of others.",1422640927

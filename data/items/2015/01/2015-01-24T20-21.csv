Motivated by the lack of accountability by food producer/manufacturers - and lack of a venue for consumers to voice concerns.<p>This was a direct result of a jar of honey I had qualms about (and probably an aggregate of other concerns & thoughts that we all build up over time on topics like this).<p>I wrote the producer an email, but would much prefer voicing my opinion public - seems that would be a far more effective way to get the issue resolved.<p>Anyway, I gave it a go with this Open Food Facts site.

It&#x27;s great that this product is in a glass jar, is 100% raw and organic - but when little chunks of plastic foil end up in my honey it totally invalidates those benefits.<p>Anyway, the feedback feature could be as simple as a comment thread below the page.

A larger screen avoids the feeling of crowdedness, at the expense of reachability. If you rarely need to access the top part of your screen, the trade-off is usually at least acceptable if not worthwhile – less so with many iOS applications.<p>I mostly use my smart phone to browse the web, and I think one of the things Windows Phone got right was to place the navigation bar on the bottom (although I don&#x27;t use Windows Phone, my phone does the same). Thus, unless there are controls at the absolute top of the page, I don&#x27;t have a problem reaching anything (most native apps on my phone support gestures, which rely less on absolute finger placement).",1422132778

I was told by an Apple Genius to get AppleCare over the phone, which I did, and then I replaced my phone using that.  That night, I bent it because I accidentally sat on it in my back pocket.  I subsequently got this replaced under the free warranty, so frankly I&#x27;m satisfied with the level of care I&#x27;ve gotten from Apple regarding these problems.<p>In the past few months, I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, but I prefer my iPhone 5.  I still have my iPhone 4 and 5 lying around, and the iPhone 5 is still nice to hold.<p>I always feel like the iphone6 is going to slip from my grasp.  I never felt that with my iPhone 5.  As well, the larger screen just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  Too many buttons or links for &quot;Next&quot;, etc are in the upper right or left hand corners, and I never can reach them with one hand.  The overall usability of the iPhone 5 is much better.<p>I do like using ApplePay, and it is much easier to read websites with the iPhone6, especially when in landscape mode.  In the end, I&#x27;ll just adapt, but it&#x27;s not like the iPhone 6 is a clear home run vs the iPhone 5, and that is probably meaningful in terms of how the pace of their innovation is slowing down.",1422132749

But if you offend the wrong person, you will most likely get fired from your job, shunned completely from your community, or bullied online.<p>It&#x27;s not even about the truth anymore.  Even mainstream news organizations spin and lie about what actually happened, with real-world consequences (and no consequences for the news orgs or the reporters).  Every news outlet spread lies about the Ferguson incident, before we even had any credible witnesses or facts.  When the facts finally came out, they continued to spread the same lies (and many continued to believe them).<p>In the past couple of years, there have been dozens of reporters that have gotten fired for an obvious mistake that was deemed &#x27;offensive&#x27; by the likes of political activist groups and used as fuel to fire them.  It&#x27;s just another form of bullying.<p>Many people don&#x27;t even know that Al Sharpton will threaten companies and demand money or work in exchange for not going after them publicly.  Pepsi paid him thousands per year in the 90s and XM radio actually gave him his own show for a couple of years to get him to stop talking about the &quot;homeless charlie&quot; incident that happened a few years back.  A quick Google search will show you many companies that essentially pay him hush money.  It tells me that when he cries racism, it&#x27;s not about bettering society, but lining his pockets.  It seems this is public knowledge now.  Why isn&#x27;t he in jail?<p>I don&#x27;t really use Facebook besides some simple private messaging between friends.  Why?  I can predict the coming storm that many people don&#x27;t seem to see.  Anything online can and will be used to instantly form an opinion about you and your life style.  Not having the right &quot;culture fit&quot; might just mean someone in management doesn&#x27;t agree with your political opinions.<p>The ex-Mozilla CEO is another good example of the problem with today&#x27;s society.  He donated a small amount of money to a cause he believed in and was bullied and ridiculed online until he quit.<p>If it had been the reverse (he supported gay-marriage and was bullied until he quit) many of those same people would be crying out about how we need to stop online bullying and probably demand the government step in.  If I were the Mozilla CEO, I would have set an example and found the people that worked for the company that spewed the most hate against me and fired them on the spot.<p>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I have found that most people are the  same: they preach open and honesty..until it&#x27;s for a cause that they disagree with.

I can make the same argument against people with long tenures. Some people, when they realize that they&#x27;ve been passed over for a promotion or that they&#x27;re not being groomed for the role they want in the future, bounce (external promotion). That&#x27;s the honest thing to do. Others stick around, play politics, work the system, slack, and wait for others to fail so they can capitalize on the chaos and move up the ranks. In other words, one could make the argument that the able, confident, ethical, honest people job hop and the political actors stick around and climb the ladder.<p>I don&#x27;t <i>actually</i> believe that most people with long tenures are unethical. I&#x27;d put the correlation right around zero, to be honest about the whole thing. I think that there are patterns that cause good people to have long tenures and bad people to have short ones, and also patterns that cause good people to have short tenures and bad people to have long ones.<p><i>First, if this guy is really so great, why has he flamed out of 3 firms in 5 years?</i><p>Maybe he&#x27;s technically excellent but bad at playing the politics. Perhaps he&#x27;s an overperformer, like McNulty on <i>The Wire</i>. Maybe he&#x27;s just unlucky. Maybe he didn&#x27;t flame out, but each move was a major promotion that he wouldn&#x27;t have been able to get internally.<p><i>Second, do I really want a guy who&#x27;s bounced from firm-to-firm glomming up ideas and IP? Won&#x27;t he do the same thing to me?</i><p>The problem isn&#x27;t &quot;job hoppers&quot;. It&#x27;s attrition. When people leave, it&#x27;s disruptive (and the internal disruption to your own processes is so much more of a threat than IP leakage, unless someone&#x27;s actually stealing code and then it goes to the courts, that the latter is a rounding error). You can control attrition by treating people well and making sure that ambitious people have appropriate opportunities get promoted on time. It has little to do with the people you hire, and much more to do with how you manage them.<p>The anti-&quot;job hopper&quot; sentiment isn&#x27;t really about IP. It&#x27;s about being mean-spirited, and the IP justification is just made to back-fill an already-formed prejudice.",1422131918

(&quot;.as_string(), or &quot;&[]&quot;?).  Things are far better than they were a month ago, though.<p>After using Rust a little, I get the feeling that the borrow system, the big innovation, is in good shape. The type system is clunky. Take a look at this date/time module:<p><a href=""https://github.com/lifthrasiir/rust-chrono/blob/master/src/datetime.rs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lifthrasiir/rust-chrono/blob/master/src/d...</a><p>Note that none of this code does any computation. It&#x27;s all field access and update. It&#x27;s not a multi-calendar system with time zone tables. This is the code for stuffing the year into a Datetime object:<p><pre><code>    #[inline]
    fn with_year(&self, year: i32) -> Option<DateTime<Off>> {
        self.local().with_year(year).and_then(|datetime|
        self.offset.from_local_datetime(&datetime).single())
    }
</code></pre>
This has generics and a closure, neither of which ought to be necessary.  Despite all this generality, there are two copies of this code, one for time-zone aware and one for &quot;naive&quot; timestamps.  The author of that module has misgivings about the structure.  He writes &quot;This is a bit verbose due to Rust&#x27;s lack of function and method overloading, but in turn we get a rich combination of initialization methods.&quot; This is the best of the three date-time modules available; the other two won&#x27;t even compile with the current build system and are abandoned.<p>There are some neat ideas in the type system. One is that if you have something which might not be able to return a value, you have it return an &quot;Option<T>&quot; value, which can have a value of type T, or a value of None. Sorting out what was returned requires a &quot;match&quot; statement, which is rather verbose. It&#x27;s an elegant way to avoid null pointers and error codes, but it&#x27;s quite verbose in practice.  The business with &quot;and_then&quot; and the closure above is to deal with that problem.  See &quot;Option Monads in Rust&quot; (&quot;<a href=""http://www.hoverbear.org/2014/08/12/option-monads-in-rust/&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hoverbear.org/2014/08/12/option-monads-in-rust/&quot;</a>) for an explanation.<p>In Python, situations like this raise a ValueError exception. In Go, situations like this return (uselessvalue, err).  The Rust solution is formally correct, but complex and verbose for what it&#x27;s doing.<p>I&#x27;m worried that all this verbiage will turn new users off.  It turns me off, and I have a background in formal systems.",1422131666

It seems that most recorded influenza deaths are from pneumonia, and aside from the very rare and deadly influenza strains, far more people have died from malaria than any other disease in the 20th century - perhaps aside from only smallpox.<p>Malaria is believed to kill on the order of a half million or more a year. There are other infectious diseases that kill millions of people - such as the many illnesses that cause diarrhea - and these are also prevalent in Africa, and related to health care.<p>Ultimately improving health care has cumulative effects. A society that does not need to worry about malaria (or influenza, for that matter) can begin to work on other issues. When so many children die every year from a random illness, adults cannot plan families, governments cannot address other issues.<p>It&#x27;s vital that malaria be cured because it is necessary to solve many other issues. Improving health care, period, would reduce the population growth rate and allow more resources to be dedicated to education, infrastructure, and yes, further improving health care.<p>It&#x27;s only in places like the United States, where the leading causes of death are from ourselves (car crashes), from disease associated with old age (cancer, heart disease), and our mistakes (medical mistakes), that we can be a society that looks so far forward.<p>It&#x27;s difficult for someone in the 21st to realize that our treatment of influenza and other diseases has prepared us to be a super power. Diseases just don&#x27;t kill people very often in the US, and allowing young children and their parents to not worry has drastically changed our society.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/lawrence-solomon/death-by-influenza_b_4661442.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/lawrence-solomon/death-by-influ...</a>",1422131144

Our answers were predictable. Because they save lives, their skills are extremely important, and it takes years and years of education to become one. All sound, logical reasons. But these traits that doctors possess are universal. So why is it, she asked, that doctors in Russia are so lowly paid? Making less than £7,500 a year, it is one of the lowest paid professions in Russia, and poorly respected at that. Why is this?&quot;<p>The answer? It doesn&#x27;t seem to be a coincidence that in Russia, doctors have been a traditionally female profession, unlike western Europe and the USA.

The profit &quot;on the silly stuff&quot; then came mostly from speculative investment, buyouts and advertisers - not from direct consumer sales. I&#x27;m not sure how different that is from today. I&#x27;m not on the latest numbers; maybe you&#x27;re better informed. Is the revenue being generated by today&#x27;s startups more often and in larger quantities from direct consumer sales?<p>I found what you said about IPOs interesting. Why is it that you think going public (before or after being profitable) is an indicator of a bubble? It seems to me to be a minor detail.<p>From what I can tell (there is no universally accepted definition of a bubble) all that is needed for a bubble is for speculation (trade-value) to outgrow revenue (use-value) at the same time speculation appears to increase the demand for, lack of supply of, or actual underlying value of a business/commodity/whathaveyou. Upon entering a feedback loop of increased speculative investment because of rapidly inflating possible returns (which do pay out up until the bubble bursts) and increased returns because of rapid inflation in the amount of venture capital, the numbers get bigger on their own without a need for change in underlying value. That is until investors withdraw, causing capital and valuations to plummet, and more investors to withdraw, ad nauseum.<p>The important thing here is that the source of investment (venture/speculative) capital need not come from any particular source, be it public option or nay. It&#x27;s possible in principle to have a bubble based on Venture Capital and private money, but its also true in practice that these VC firms are often traded publicly themselves and promise returns based on their investments.<p>The second paragraph and last sentence are fascinating, but isn&#x27;t the hypothesis here that the bubble hasn&#x27;t burst yet?",1422130139

You&#x27;re warned when the compiler detects this, and it can be resolved by giving one a higher priority.<p>I personally didn&#x27;t find the semantics to be unreasonably complicated, but the type system is very much based on Haskell&#x27;s so if you&#x27;re not used to that there&#x27;ll be more of a learning curve.",1422129829

The article does seem to go out of its way to make a point that could stand on its own. I am the first to admit I question people who don&#x27;t make things, but &quot;just&quot; criticize, however that has nothing to do with gender, but with a different kind of bias.",1422129714

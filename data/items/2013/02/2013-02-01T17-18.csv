5152228,comment,5150901,5151930,3,0,betterunix,,,"""I don't think there is a moral argument for ""freeing"" existing content""<p>Well I guess that depends on what you base your morality on.  I am of the view that it is inherently immoral to base a person's access to education on their wealth, because it ensures that wealthier people will have an easier time remaining wealthy and that poor people will have a harder time becoming wealthy.  That applies equally to grade-school mathematics and reading texts as it does to academic journals.<p>""all parties to the ""paid journal"" business model, including the paper authors, seem to have entered into these arrangements with coercion.""<p>Failure to publish means losing your job as a researcher; how is that not coercive?<p>""The authors of papers are, in fact, paid; they are paid with the prestige that comes from being published in such a journal""<p>Which is detrimental to the quality of research, and by extension harmful to society.  By making publishing so prestigious, we have encouraged researchers to tackle only smaller, safer problems, to avoid questioning the validity of commonly used research techniques, and to waste resources by publishing minute variations on a single idea over and over again.  Since copyright itself exists ""to promote the progress of science,"" it would seem that correcting those problems would be of paramount importance -- and the prestige associated with publishing in a ""big name"" journal is one of the factors that created this situation.",1359741374

It is remarkably easy to assess, and everyone who cares to know already knows the answer.<p>After you break under torture, the victim will tell the torturer anything they think the torturer wants to hear, and has very little sense of what is or is not true.  ""Beating"" torture is simple - pretend break early and tell interesting lies.  When you really break you'll no longer know truth from fiction - nor can a questioner who has no idea which leads are true and false.  Once you've hit that point then absolutely no method of getting information can work.<p>We have much, much more reliable interrogation techniques.

In some respects, predicting early traffic for a coffee shop is what I would imagine it to be like if you were looking at good locations for a gas station. Since there's nothing too novel about the _concept_ of a coffee shop, before people try you out, they're going to judge you by what part of town you're in, how easy it is to park, and other logistical factors. Once you get people in the door, that's where you need to start differentiating yourself. If you can impress your first customers, get them talking, and stay consistent, the draw of the shop will expand outside of the neighborhood.

You could roughly replicate it with:<p><pre><code>    var i, elements = document.getElementsByClassName('widget');
    for (i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
        elements[i].style.color = ""green"";
    }
    for (i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
        elements[i].style.fontSize = ""16px"";
    }

Two loops. The ""improved"" suggestion would be roughly equivalent to:<p><pre><code>    var i, elements = document.getElementsByClassName('widget');
    for (i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
        elements[i].style.color = ""green"";
        elements[i].style.fontSize = ""16px"";
    }
</code></pre>
This is one loop, but it's still O(n). If there are 100 "".widget"" elements on the page, the first code does 200 writes to the style property. The second code does 200 writes to the style property. The difference in jumps and compares isn't worth thinking about when style changes are so expensive, the difference is probably immeasurable.<p>The second version is better just because it's cleaner code, but that's it.",1359740312

They shortly got a PDP-10, which I miss, and we commenced to rewrite the compiler in Bliss-36.  So it was essentially a cross-compiler, spitting out 8085 machine code with a very fancy assembler listing, including timings for each basic block.<p>The project was wildly successful, and opened the door to switching processers.

Although, frankly, I've looked at company websites, and top-level executives with PhDs are not _that_ common, even in software companies. But yeah, I mean, there _should_ be a top-level decision maker who is _at least_ keeping a close watch on any research related to what the company does (I'm talking software companies here, not companies that _use_ software)... and the vast majority of people who have the necessary skills will be people who did PhD-level research. Anyway, this person should be able to advocate for how the company can leverage new research, and this should not just be left to lower-level (hierarchically) technical folks who have no true strategic voice in the company.<p><i>To found your own company and leverage your PhD skills seems tempting but rarely if ever do PhD's have research that can be converted into successful industry products.</i><p>Do you think this is true even of CS PhDs? I feel like in my research group, there is a real chance for any of we (students) to do this, but AFAIK I am the only one who has ever really thought about it, because my colleagues tend to keep their noses in the books and focus on narrow technical concerns, whereas I'm really a big-picture thinker. So: in my case, plenty of opportunity, just not much interest among actual PhD students.",1359739797

If you're a single person, willing to share an apartment with someone else, then you can rent just a room (""inneboende""). That's likely the easiest. You can also look for a sublease (""andrahandskontrakt""). But getting a lease (""frstahandskonrakt"") is hard. Parts of town require you to be on a waiting list which can be up to 5 years long. For Gothenburg, I was on the list for 1.5 years for a lease before we gave up and moved to the smaller city of Trollhttan.<p>No startup scene, but a 1,300 sq. ft. apartment in the center of town (3bd, 1.5 ba) goes for only $1,500/month, and the commuter train to Gothenburg takes about 45 minutes.<p>If you have money you can get a ""business apartment"" for about 2x the normal rate. Those are pretty easy to find.

When a place is ""1 rum"" it means studio, ""2 rum"" means ""living room and bedroom"", etc. As a decent approximation, 1sq meter is 10 sq. feet.<p>Rates in the tech area of Kista look about $700 for a shared room/studio. In Sdermalm I see prices more around $800 for a room/studio, though you can pay a lot more.

As much as I dislike academic publishing, the last thing I want is to have deans and their staff evaluate the merits of research on a case by case basis.  It sounds nice in theory, I guess, but they're people with agendas and biases too, and even setting that aside, they don't have the time or the training to do it.  (as an, I hope, neutral example: could a dean trained as an economist really evaluate the relative merits of 15 different experimental physics papers?  Could a trained physicist really evaluate the contributions of 15 different economics papers?) (note that this all applies to deans at <i>other</i> universities.  The deans at <i>my</i> university are of course exceptional and above reproach).<p>So, on the one hand, even MIT probably can't unilaterally make a lot of progress on this issue.  On the other hand... almost every recent paper I've ever been interested in is available from the author's webpage (making this quote: ""much of the work produced in academia is never seen by anyone outside that cloistered world, because everyone whos not affiliated with a university is cut off from access"" ring hollow to me), all of the work to produce the journals is done for free or nearly free by researchers, and (anecdotally) everyone prefers electronic copies of the journal articles anyway.  It seems like open access publication is almost inevitable.<p>A more manageable (but less sexy) step might be for MIT and other universities to defray the admin costs for some of these flagship journals that want to go open-access.  The article mentions the <i>American Historical Review</i> as having annual (editorial) costs of about $500k [1], which is tiny for a university.<p>[1] From this post: <a href=""http://blog.historians.org/news/1734/aha-statement-on-scholarly-journal-publishing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.historians.org/news/1734/aha-statement-on-schola...</a>",1359739462

If it did organizations such as eBay would have certainly made the move by now.<p>At some level --at least for me-- if it isn't going to generate more  revenue it isn't worth the extra effort.<p>Clearly I don't have any data to back-up my claim so we'll have to leave it as conjecture at this point.  I can't say either way.  Just a hunch from observing what's going on with top-level sites both as a developer and a user.<p>I equate this to the whole 3D movie/3D TV fad. Yes, this is probably a bad analogy.  The point is that 3D has always been a fad.  It comes back every N years and everyone proclaims that ""this is what it will take off"".  Film producers get all hot-and-bothered and jump on the 3D bandwagon and forget why people go to see movies: The story.  A 1940's black and white movie with a great story will always do better than a new film with a bad story, no matter how much tech, 3D and special effects you throw at it.<p>I guess what I am saying is that content is far, far more significant than design gimmicks.  Customers don't come to your site to be in awe of your engineering or design chops.  Craigslist proved that point long ago.  No, they come to your site for the value they may be able to derive from it.  Good relevant content and great value are at the top of the list.  Ease of use and security may be second.  Beyond that, everything else is optional and, in my book, can only be justified if you can show that it can improve conversions relative to other approaches.<p>As I said before, one of the reasons I currently tend to reject the idea of responsive design is that it can create a situation where site optimization becomes a geometric problem.  Now you have a dozen layouts per page to optimize vs maybe two.  I've seen some really amazing optimization reports where things as simple as the position and size of elements have made a huge difference.  I am not sure how you'd even begin to approach that with responsive design when you've introduced so many additional variables in to what --in the cased of fixed design-- was so simple.",1359738879

It is pretty dumb to send CS PhD recipients from reputable universities home, or force them to go through the idiocy of temporary work visas with dual intent to remain in the us.  It makes more sense to just grant residency.<p>I just have a very, very different opinion about the rest of this.<p>First, I think that PhD programs in the sciences are generally a poor return on investment relative to other options (the professional degrees, in particular).  Here's a link to a RAND study that concludes that the American allergy to STEM PhD's is rational and market-driven.<p><a href=""http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html</a><p>My guess would be that PhDs in CS are a better investment than science degrees in the aggregate.  However, PhD degrees in CS still have sky high attrition rates and time to completion compared to the professions, and salary and employment prospects long term for top students who could attend elite law, medical, business, or other professional schools are still better than what is offered by PhD programs.<p>In short, I think that any ""shortage"", to the extent that it exists, is market driven and rational.  PhD programs need to face a reckoning, and they need to change.  The RAND study makes some good suggestions, but PhD programs won't change if they can position themselves as gatekeepers to US residency.  They'll just wave goodbye to the Americans who already have residency and don't have to go through this bullshit, and continue their abuse of students who have fewer legal options to reside here.<p>This brings me to my next disagreement - that PhD students make up the costs of their scholarship ""to some extent.""  I think this is a vast understatement.  Talented PhD students in STEM fields are profit centers for universities.  The work product of a 5th year PhD student in a biochemistry lab vastly exceeds the minor stipend this student is paid.  This is why PhD programs like to string out their students.  It's a big reason for why they won't move to the professional model (advocated by the RAND study).<p>In short, I hold opposing positions here, depending on which perspective I take.  Yes, PhD graduates from STEM programs should be granted residency, it's nuts to send them home or force them to jump through hoops.  No, PhD programs should not, under any circumstances, hold the power to grant residency to international students.  They will abuse this - they already do.",1359738574

    Full Time or Contract. Remote OK, Local Preferred.

    Positive-Cash Flow with 8 full time employees + contractors, interns
</code></pre>
We are a 1.5 yr old startup working to disrupt the $60 billion waste industry, and we are primarily looking for a backend & systems developer. We need individuals who are willing to solve problems inherent to an aging industry, and by doing so, topple the biggest players in the market.<p><pre><code>    About the company: 
</code></pre>
Sequoia is saving businesses money by incentivizing them to recycle. We work with almost any sized business to make recycling and waste-vendor management simple.<p>We have hundreds of client locations in a dozen states, and are cash flow positive with reoccurring monthly revenue, but need to stay on top of our tech development to stay ahead of the multi-billion dollar players in the space.<p>You will be an integral part of a small development team, tasked with improving upon 1-2 years of database, iOS, and customer portal/CRM development.<p>Currently we are rebuilding our backend, taking into consideration all the lessons of our first year and a half with clients. After doing so, we'll be prepared to roll out service in nearly every metro-area around the country - scaling on what will be your product!<p><pre><code>    <-- Requirements/Responsibilties -->
</code></pre>
Leadership experience, with the ability to produce from conception to execution.
Comfortable architecting 'behind the scenes' systems, and building those systems in a manner suitable for scale.
A keen eye for customer UX.<p>Preferably, you have a cool project, website, or demo that you could send in.<p>We've done a majority of development for iOS, and run our data services on Salesforce and an AWS RDS instance. We're looking to get away from Salesforce as the backend to our customer portal and develop our own, pulling data from our own database.<p><pre><code>    <-- What we will be working on -->
</code></pre>
Collecting more data streams, via government agencies and any available API's, so that we may better analyze our customer's services.
Further down the road, we will make trash receptacles 'smart' for data collection and customer service.<p><pre><code>    <-- To apply -->

All platforms are ought to be used only as a tool, not as a foundation of business. In other words earn trust with your clients and steer them to do business directly with you, without platform-as-a-middleman.
Use platform to gain clients, gain business. Pay fair commission for it's services but don't sell yourself short to platform just because they want you to.<p>2. Have plan B (or rather platform B) in case platform A failed to deliver, got disgruntled or becomes unruly. Maintain accounts at different platforms as a backup.<p>3. Platform's TOS is not a law (although they want you to think that) it's a guidance for crowds. Have your own brains.",1359738235

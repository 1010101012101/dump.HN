5295611,comment,5293883,5293883,2,0,jhund,,,"I really like this approach. I use something similar for my work, however this has a much nicer API.<p>Often these patterns are treated and discussed as an either/or decision, which I don't agree with. There are many places in an app where the default and simple Rails way is the right choice. However as apps get more complex, there is also a need for approaches like the one presented here.<p>My rule for choosing the right approach is this:<p>If it's just a simple CRUD controller where it receives input from a simple form and writes attributes to a single model, with no AR callbacks involved, then omakase is perfectly acceptable. In that case I don't want to have to jump through all kinds of hoops and overcome unnecessary friction added by enterprisey patterns.<p>However, as soon as I have to use AR callbacks, add more lines to my controller action, or touch more than one model, that's a clear indication that a service object makes sense.<p>Mutations looks like a great solution for the latter case. It brings in some DCI goodness as well. The key is that some operations require complex context (object graphs, permissions, dependent operations), and that context should be treated as a first class citizen.",1362005949

The second wave of feminism was all about achieving literal equality - changing society so that women could take on the exact same roles and challenges as men.<p>I wouldn't say such a conception is inherently problematic, but it certainly raises difficult questions. How can we frame an equality that is based on each gender's needs without importing all the old baggage of gender stereotyping? Who defines each gender's needs -- do we care only about those that are purely biologically, or also those that are deeply embedded in the culture? How do we account for those who don't fit -- either physically or culturally -- into the dominant gender categories? And so on.",1362005789

I simply doubt the complex interplay of settings within x264 lends itself to mere knob-turning.</i><p>You're treating x264 like some box of black magic.<p>As far as the perceptual tunings go, x264 already provides the three most important knobs (aq, psy-rd, psy-trellis) that, due to their nature, can't be a ""one size fit all"" deal. x264 makes no attempt to guess which of those settings would fit your source best and only offer a conservative Default and a series of tunings for marginally more fine-grained control.<p>A hypothetical, ""better"" approach would be to have an amazingly intelligent first pass be done to split the movies into scenes and calculate the perceptual weights for each scene. That way, in a movie like Kill Bill, the animated, fast-action, and talking-head scenes would all be perceptually optimized, as they all need <i>vastly</i> differently settings. Splitting the movies into zones also open up a whole plethora of options for fine-tuning quality. Again, you can always reach these options from the command line.<p>(Also, x264's psy-rd is hilariously unoptimized for high-stress bitrates. I'm not sure if the purported ""service"" being discussed in this thread can handle those bitrates, but it's an area needing massive tweaks. x264's main role seem to be high-quality archiving, however, so this is merely a tangent.)<p>> Even if they managed to build a pre-analysis model that figures out decent settings to feed into x264, it would break to some extent whenever x264's code/algos are changed.

5295476,comment,5293152,5294553,1,0,tharzoss,,,"It's funny that you want to see it as a flaw, while it's the only way that makes sense to me. You simply have a slight case of pointer-phobia.<p>Languages like Python insist that there is a difference between basic data types and objects, that the former should copy by value, and the latter by reference. But what is a basic data type? Is a list (a builtin data type) basic? It turns out to be no (and it makes sense if you think of how C arrays are just pointers), and every python tutorial has to warn you of that. When are you dealing with reference, and when are you dealing with values? Expect to do some reading.<p>While in C, we have actual pointers. Your reference is simply syntactic sugar when compared to actual pointers (and pointer to pointers). That means all C structs and basic data types can behave consistently (copying by value). Even pointers themselves are just fancy integers that copy by value. If you want to copy the references, use their addresses. C++ add classes, which are just fancier versions of structs (and thus similarly copy by value) and references, which are just pointers (that also make sure the objects exist). C++ also allows you to redefine the assignment operator itself, which I usually use to disallow copying complex objects by value (which can never hurt). I'm not scared of the power C++ gives me, but I understand many are, and thus I use it sparingly and document it carefully.<p>Consistency, pointers, deterministic object destruction ... They're why C and C++ rule. You can make the case that they are too difficult for some programmers. But they are great for those who want clarity, control and performance.",1362004627

Used it once or twice for ruby, but not enough to know how good it was as I have never used ruby otherwise. Intellij is also its own code base, not another fork of eclipse, like most IDEs out there. Intelij also has built in support for git, hg, github/bitbucket, pretty much any SQL dialect including SQLite (as well as SQL syntax checking ERD diagramming, and table editing). Unit testing integration for python, php, javascript, java. Django support (and for templates), Google App Engine (python and java), jQuery support, javadoc support, epydoc/restructured support, phpdoc support, jsdoc support, and some of the popular php frameworks. I could go on, but you can see it pretty much comes with everything one needs (and what one does not need can be disabled from plugins). If it does not come with it, open a feature request and they'll probably add it later.<p>Other IDEs I have used:<p>- Aptana (PHP, html/js, css, python). It's really a fork of eclipse with some additional features. If you want a free IDE, it's better than eclipse, but not quite as good as intellij.<p>- Visual Studio (2005, 2010, 2012). Great if you are doing C# or F# and combine it with Jetbrain's Resharper. Not as fond of it for other languages though. I've heard JS support is also very good now, but my web development is all scripting languages like Python and PHP so it does not help me much.<p>- NuSphere's PHPed. A good natively compiled IDE for PHP and web, but development kind of lags behind other IDEs and a few bugs that were never fixed when I used it would constantly annoy me. Also, only Windows unless you do WINE (it worked well enough on WINE though).<p>- Eclipse. Eclipse interface is clunky and honestly, it's slower than Intellij or any of its derivative cousins. Aptana improves on it though. Used Eclipse for a couple of years before finding Aptana and then moving onto Intellij.<p>It's not just about the IDE though, jetbrains in general is a great company. Despite English not being their first language for many employees, they have awesome customer service and are very up front about their road map and interact with their users directly.<p>I've used some commercial IDEs in the past, such as NuSphere's PHPed (which was a decent IDE at the time, not sure how it is now). PHPed's developers did not speak English as their primary language either, but they did not have anywhere close to the same level of interaction and support. Jetbrain's bug tracker is open for anyone to report on and they actually fix stuff you report (filed a few reports over the past few years, all were eventually fixed).<p>Maybe I'm just getting overly excited over what any decent company should be doing in the first place. However, many IDE vendors do not seem to do that overly well. Having confidence in the developers of your IDE is important (at least to me) and that they are listening to their customers/users.",1362004270

5295280,comment,5295223,5295223,1,0,swalsh,,,"Personally i'm cautious with my expectations as I approach glass.  It's clear that instant accessibility of information changes literally everything.  For example as I drive to work, i like to listen to lectures from Itunes U.  Today during the lecture the professor mentioned a concept I wasn't familiar with.  Unfortunately there was no way for me to stop, and find out what that was.  Which means there was some clear missed value on my part.<p>Google glass is an attempt to bring additional context related information into your life.  That's a game changer, but until I see it, I have a really hard time believing glass can deliver this quite yet.  But it might get us started in the right direction, and that alone is significant.",1362002675

I came across the Wikipedia data (available for download).<p>Now I am trying to list out the questions that I could as this data.<p>What are the questions that you want answered from the data available in the Wikipedia data?<p>This will help me write some useful MapReduce code , Hive quries or Pig scripts to improve my skills.<p>I just feel that learning by doing is the best form of learning.<p>Thanks.",1362002583

2092031,comment,2091720,2091720,0,0,detokaal,,,"Ugh, another story provoked by the tragic shooting in Arizona.  Worse yet, it implicitly links Beck to the shooter by its timing.  It's clear now there is no link.  Period.<p>The shooter's videos and writings cite everything from the Communist Manifesto to Mein Kempf.  His friends describe him as a liberal.  Most people are unaware Ms. Gifford is Jewish.  Is that why this Nazi-influenced man killed her?  Let's not draw lines connecting things that  create a desired picture.  If he was Arabic and owned a Koran, would we make the same leap that some would eagerly make if actually owned a book by Beck?  What if he was a registered Republican (he registered independent and didn't vote in the recent election)?  Stop it folks, please.<p>He was a nut case, plain and simple; no more and no less.<p>That being said, can we agree that violent rhetoric and imagery is a poor choice for anyone in politics?  Does it really matter if it a map with cross hairs created by a PAC supporting Sarah Palin or a map of bullseyes created by the DNC?  So Beck uses violent wordplay?  Don't forget Obama, ""They bring a knife, we bring a gun"" and ""hit back twice as hard"" or even ""punish your enemies.""  Just yesterday, Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa said about GOP Gov. Rick Scott: ""They ought to put him against a wall and shoot him.""  We can find an equal number of bad examples from all parties, races and genders.<p>Maybe it's time for everyone to stop.<p>P.S. His most violent video rant has the song ""Bodies"" by Drowning Pool playing in the background.  I would be remiss to point out what a horrible influence heavy metal music is on our youth today.  That must be the real reason why he shot those people...",1294757888

Whatever extra money they have is likely just going to a slightly nicer house, their IRA, dental insurance, a slightly better preschool for their kids, etc. In other words, if you're making 300,000 per year then you probably can't afford to fly to Hawaii for the weekend on a whim any more than someone making 80,000 can.",1294757514

2092021,comment,2091871,2091920,0,0,modoc,,,"I disagree with this.  While I'm not saying I was ever ""poor"" (as I never felt poor), I started out working for $5.15/hour, and sleeping on a friend's couch while I tried to find an apartment I could afford.  Then I moved into a boston apartment that was $1000/month for three of us.  It was falling over, and I ate homemade burritos every single day because beans and tortillas were cheap.<p>Now I own a big house, drive nice cars, and earn a lot more than back then, but I still don't feel rich.  The rise in income over 12 years, was more or less matched by a rise in lifestyle and spending.  Don't get me wrong, life is more comfortable, and I'm able to do lots of things I want to do that weren't possible before, but I still don't feel ""rich"" (I do feel lucky and blessed, etc...).  I hate my 1/2 working 30 year old electric cooktop.  I want a new gas cooktop, but that means new counter tops, and running a gas line, and if I'm doing new counter tops I should probably re-do the cabinets at the same time, and if I'm doing those, I should do the floors, and if I'm doing cabinets I should really replace the wall oven and fridge while I'm at it.  But I don't have that kind of money!  And I still have to bust my ass every day at work.  So until you're really ""RICH"", and you still have to set the alarm and work every day, and you have things you want, but can't afford, you don't ""feel"" ""rich"".<p>Is this a healthy well adjusted mindset, probably not.

And, yes, he's aware of all the qualifications that attend such a crude number.<p>The ability to talk is obviously a significant trait. But it is not an extraordinary one. Everybody uses language in some form (a subject in which Pinker is strongly versed.) What language you speak is decidedly less significant and something most parents don't get to choose. I'd be surprised if the differential impact among parents on this point was even 1%. Most kids don't end up speaking like their parents. They end up speaking like their peers.<p>Dropping a kid on her head or locking her in a closet for her teenage years (with or without a violin) are obvious ways a parent could have a more extraordinary impact on her child's development, but, happily, they are not very typical.<p>Harris and Pinker's point is that parents have a pretty perfunctory role in a child's development (feed, protect, provide the rudiments of cognitive development) and much less influence than most people generally suppose (probably, most of all, parents that think they are having an impact). What influence they do have is regularly mixed up with genetic characteristics that the child has inherited.<p>Chua's argument seems to reinforce the point: to move the needle requires draconian measures.",1294757451

But it's less self-explanatory, in that scp/ssh commands are replaced by full names.<p>One might argue that the rush version is more conceptually elegant, because everything is objects, and you can streamline treatments this way, but :<p>- Even if this isn't true for bash, in practice it's the same thing, because connection strings are treated like hosts by all relevant programs, directory strings like directories by all relevant programs, etc. You lose in typing but not in usability<p>- This is in a context of a script where the authors considered it was better to actually have variables for everything, so that, i guess, the thing be better configurable, readable, and reusable. That's a good goal, but it's not always necessary.<p>Let's see how ""raw"" versions of the two compare :<p><pre><code>    scp -r /Users/adam/myproj/ my.remote.server.com:/home/myproj/app\n    ssh my.remote.server.com ""find /home/myproj/app/ -name .svn | xargs rm""\n</code></pre>\nversus<p><pre><code>    root['/Users/adam/myproj/'].copy_to Rush::Box.new('my.remote.server.com')['/home/myproj/app/']\n    Rush::Box.new('my.remote.server.com')['/home/myproj/app/**/.svn/'].each { |d| d.destroy }\n</code></pre>\nThe verboseness is of course worse when you don't declare variables. Let's be honest, i don't often declare variables for one off commands on the shell. I use auto-complete and i'm done with it. And for having typed this rush example by hand, i can assure you i'm not really ready to type that again anytime soon.<p>So i seriously doubt something like rush can replace something like bash/ssh. The benefits are likely to show up for bigger operations, where lots of people already use perl/python/ruby anyway because bash is a PITA for any serious programming, but bash still seems a lot more usable as a ""shell"", and i kind of understood this was the purpose of this.",1294756794

In general, any best practices or learnings from experience re:communication/UX for optimizing download conversion rates? How would you ""couch"" a download (albeit a small one) if you knew it was a necessary step in the user funnel?

Any experience or data indicating that the app download should be part of the registration process or after the user enters the site? In one case you might hurt the registration step in the funnel and in another you might hurt the download step.<p>Some background: Unlike other products I've worked on in the past, the GameGround UX is part website and part lightweight desktop app. The two work hand-in-hand simultaneously. The desktop app automatically saves your scores in games you play on the web, your PC, and console. It also shows you a game summary at the end of any session highlighting your scores, new rank, and what to achieve next.  The website displays your scores and accomplishments and allows you to compare and compete with friends. You can also launch games from the website, but you don't have to - the app still saves your scores and rewards your progress.<p>Sorry for the lengthiness here.

Just because parents derive pride from their children's success doesn't mean that you are nothing more than ""an ornament."" How did they abandon you?<p>I am personally disappointed in my parents because when I decided it was easier to just skate by in life as a teen, they let me get away with it. Things are sharper now, but I wasted a huge portion of my life and they were more concerned that I didn't want to go to church any more and were placated by my athletic achievements.<p>So, showing your kids no love is bad, but giving in to them for short term happiness sucks too. The self-esteem movement is overdone.  I know people who are afraid to tell their kids that they are fat. Honesty and direction communication among family is enabled by strong family bonds, and, particularly in East Asian cultures, Confucian values that clearly establish the roles of parent and child.  It's just hard to find the right balance to get kids to maximize performance.",1294755465

There's basically two ways to build a successful blog - the first is to only produce <i>extremely</i> high quality content. This means writing less frequently and throwing away your pieces that aren't incredibly polished and don't come out just right.<p>This is the model that Paul Graham and Derek Sivers follow, for instance. This model requires you to let pretty-good-but-not-excellent blog posts/essays die on the vine, so the signal:noise ratio remains incredibly high.<p>The other way is to post every single day. I did a little surveying of the landscape, and it seems like going from 4x per week to every single day produces a few massive jumps - more consistent visitors, a faster finding and evolving of your core topics of any given time, and faster evolution in your writing ability.<p>If you've already got practice in writing, a well-defined theme, and have launched enough projects or writing or marketing materials that you can recognize when you've got a winner on your hands, then the high-quality-only model can work well. For the rest of us, every single day is far more likely to lead to improvement and successes.",1294755244

I hope he didn't get a Scala program to do the list!!!<p>I am always deeply suspicious of any appeal for using a language that uses as it's initial premise that the language is shorter or saves keystrokes.<p>Personally, I'd take one of his examples and make it 'worserer' by enbiggening it.<p><pre><code>  new RunningReporter();\n\n  public class RunningReporter extends Thread {\n    public void run() {\n      System.out.println(""Running"");\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAnd then I'd redesign it to something useful, e.g.<p><pre><code>  public class RunningReporter extends Thread {\n    public void run() {\n      System.out.println(""Running"");\n      doSomething();\n    }\n    public void doSomething() {}\n  }\n</code></pre>\nSo then subclasses of running reporter would spit out Running to System.out.println and then go and do their funky thing.<p>But even that isn't as useful as it could be, it should really be something like:<p><pre><code>  public class RunningReporter extends Thread {\n    String message = """";\n    public RunningReporter(String s) {\n      super();\n      message = s;\n    }\n    public void run() {\n      System.out.println(message);\n      doSomething();\n    }\n    public void doSomething() {}\n  }\n</code></pre>\nOkay, so now you can customise the message, so that you can tell these threads apart if you're doing stuff:<p>e.g.<p><pre><code>  new BluetoothRunningReporter(""Spp fix""); \n</code></pre>\nSo we've passed through shorter, and gotten bigger, but the line that would be used in the program conveys enormously much more information.<p>I find that upon examination, in a properly and well designed Java system almost all of the anonymity disappears... which makes me uncomfortable with that example of how Scala is better than Java, because in the real world, if you were doing it properly, you wouldn't do it that way in Java anyway.",1294755173

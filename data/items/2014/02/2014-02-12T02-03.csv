Most of PG&#x27;s stuff was written for technical folks considering entry level technical jobs. I would guess that even considering survivorship bias, the average outcome for elite startup tracks versus entry level tech track is extremely good, considering the jobs it can lead to (would love to hear if otherwise).<p>It&#x27;s a little harder to compare for the theoretical econ major from harvard contemplating a wall street track. wall street is not a normal business environment - oligopolistic, heavy regulatory protections - much more like joining a club earning economic rents off capital flows than a group doing much to change the world.<p>IMHO the main reason people work 100 hour weeks in finance is to prove they are willing to give up everything in their life to make it to the next rung - not because they are doing anything particularly noteworthy or unusual that demands intensive focus. from first hand experience, I&#x27;ve noted most M&A customers have sophisticated in house teams that can run the numbers plenty well on their own, which does raise the question what the six banks typically advising them are doing.<p>All I can say is - for the average econ major contemplating the future on wall street - it will be really interesting when Amazon (and/or others) decide to take on financial services. regulations can hold them off for a while, but as they eat the rest of the world, it&#x27;s inevitable hungry eyes will aggressively turn to where the money is (literally) - only a matter of time I&#x27;m sure.<p>Plan accordingly, I say.",1392172316

Also, they can be found so cheaply that it&#x27;s computationally trivial to do even for an individual [1]. Thus anyone who can change what data you receive, can trivially also make it hash to the same MD5.

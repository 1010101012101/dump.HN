If you look at a company like Apple right now, they basically have unlimited money to pay salaries based off of proceeds from products that are built by their engineering team. Any budget that a department has at Apple is made up by some executive based on some crazy formula of expected returns. It has nothing to do with what they can afford. That means they could literally double every engineer&#x27;s salary tomorrow and it wouldn&#x27;t really change much for their bottom line.<p>In an environment like that where money is not scarce but engineering skills are, how can the salaries not climb and how can small companies even DREAM of competing? Or course the big players don&#x27;t want to get into a bidding war because they know both sides can afford to pay a lot more.<p>One of my recent jobs was VP of Tech for a small startup. They offered me what they could afford plus equity. The product they were working on was not going to be Facebook size. I think realistically they could have had a 100 million dollar buyout in 5ish years if everything went well. OR they could have gone broke. They gave me 1% of the company in my package which is huge, but that means I&#x27;m gambling on the success of this startup for a hopeful payout of 1 million dollars in 5 or so years. At the same time this was happening a few of my friends took jobs at Apple and guess what? They were offered packages that basically meant they would make as much as I did in 5 years if I were to get the million. So, where was my upside?

The modules for xml, parsing, swing as well as the (unsupported) continuations plugin and library are available individually or via scala-library-all. Note that this artifact has weaker binary compatibility guarantees than scala-library – as explained above.<p>The compiler has been modularized internally, to separate the presentation compiler, scaladoc and the REPL. We hope this will make it easier to contribute. In this release, all of these modules are still packaged in scala-compiler.jar. We plan to ship them in separate JARs in 2.12.x.<p>Reflection, macros and quasiquotes<p>Please see this detailed changelog that lists all significant changes and provides advice on forward and backward compatibility.<p>See also this summary of the experimental side of the 2.11 development cycle.\n        #3321 introduced Sprinter, a new AST pretty-printing library! Very useful for tools that deal with source code.<p>Back-end<p>The GenBCode back-end (experimental in 2.11). See @magarciaepfl’s extensive documentation.<p>A new experimental way of compiling closures, implemented by @JamesIry. With -Ydelambdafy:method anonymous functions are compiled faster, with a smaller bytecode footprint. This works by keeping the function body as a private (static, if no this reference is needed) method of the enclosing class, and at the last moment during compilation emitting a small anonymous class that extends FunctionN and delegates to it. This sets the scene for a smooth migration to Java 8-style lambdas (not yet implemented).<p>Branch elimination through constant analysis #2214<p>Compiler Performance<p>Incremental compilation has been improved significantly. To try it out, upgrade to sbt 0.13.2-M2 and add incOptions := incOptions.value.withNameHashing(true) to your build! Other build tools are also supported. More info at this sbt issue – that’s where most of the work happened. More features are planned, e.g. class-based tracking.<p>We’ve been optimizing the batch compiler’s performance as well, and will continue to work on this during the 2.11.x cycle.<p>Improve performance of reflection SI-6638<p>IDE * Numerous bug fixes and improvements!<p>REPL<p>The bytecode decompiler command, :javap, now works with Java 7 SI-4936 and has sprouted new options SI-6894 (Thanks, @som-snytt!)<p>Added command :kind to help to tell ground types from type constructors. #2340 (Thanks, George Leontiev and Eugene Yokota!)<p>The interpreter can now be embedded as a JSR-166 Scripting Engine SI-874. (Thanks, Raphael Jolly!)<p>Warnings * Warn about unused private / local terms and types, and unused imports, under -Xlint. This will even tell you when a local var could be a val.<p>Slimming down the compiler<p>The experimental .NET backend has been removed from the compiler.<p>Scala 2.10 shipped with new implementations of the Pattern Matcher and the Bytecode Emitter. We have removed the old implementations.<p>Search and destroy mission for ~5000 chunks of dead code. #1648",1394093684

It&#x27;s unfortunate that new technology will let parents hover forever.<p>Luckily, they&#x27;re resourceful.  I wonder if it&#x27;s possible to hack the app to send false location data?  There are ways to jailbreak a phone that make it appear unjailbroken (e.g. to put a keylogger on it).  Maybe this technique could be used to acquire freedom, by MITMing whatever findmyfriends is sending to their servers and modifying it in transit.  The phone&#x27;s location is probably a JSON field in the request.

Maybe you&#x27;re only thinking about people who grew up south of the southern border.  Low skill immigrants come from many places.  Many pay lots of money to get here, if they don&#x27;t see a market for their low skills, there is no reason to come here.  Low hanging fruit [low skills jobs] are being replaced by automation, slowly, but it&#x27;s on its way.  Currently there is a net negative low skills immigrant flow.  As automation accelerates, it&#x27;s likely to increase low skills immigrant outflows.  Conversely, we may see more net inflows of mid and high skills immigrants.<p>And, as minimum wages go up, high school graduates become more willing to work.  At $10 you may not find manual labor worthwhile, but at $15 it looks more enticing.  Now, immigrants typically work a little harder, but not so much to overcome a lack of education and poor communication skills --which can take years to develop if Eng is not their native lang.<p>As tech advances and &quot;hollows out&quot; low skilled labor from advanced economies, these economies will struggle to keep their mid skills labor market employed.",1453442294

I&#x27;ve never seen an instance where somebody stole an idea that hadn&#x27;t already been realised successfully; I&#x27;m sure it happens, but I reckon it&#x27;s pretty rare.<p>I think unrealised business ideas, even those that turn out to be hugely successful, often don&#x27;t sound that compelling unless you&#x27;re personally invested in them already. Hence people don&#x27;t tend to steal them.<p>On the other hand, if something is already successful that <i>can</i> significantly derisk, or reduce the perception of risk, involved in attempting it yourself<i>, and therefore might make it more appealing to copy.<p>So, yes, I agree, where brilliant equates to demonstrably successful.<p></i>Obviously if something is too well established, or your potential competitors massively overmatch you in terms of talent or resources, this argument falls apart. There&#x27;s probably some combination of optimal scale/adoption/market awareness/penetration/maturity, etc., that makes this more viable. In a consolidated market copying would almost certainly be a terrible idea.",1453442287

10951022,comment,10948588,10950768,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Most of those languages had no clear, formal spec early on. Especially C and C++: one getting started with UNIX and ad hoc code with the other starting as C w/ Classes plus some extra features from other languages. IIRC, Java&#x27;s initial mandates hurt it because they were terrible quality in a number of areas and took up to a 15x (yes, times) performance hit in some measurements I saw. JavaScript were two, competing implementations with a ship-first mentality with a bit of it standardized later with vendor-specific stuff left in. C# did have a language specification on v1.0 whose quality I have no knowledge of. I do know they internally beta&#x27;d it starting in the late 90&#x27;s. So, it was done similar to Rust but privately for years before that spec.<p>So, I&#x27;m not seeing your examples as relevant or a critique. Most were in use and changing [to their benefit] before any spec was created. Three of those very publicly, one privately. Another sucked partly thanks to formalizations with lots of money driving adoption. I think you should read Gabriel&#x27;s Worse is Better essays... several rather than just the first... to see why pushing a partly done or evolving system is right approach for growth & accelerated improvements. Lipner at Microsoft, inventor of successful Security Development Lifecycle, incidentally thought the same thing.<p>Least Rust team is trying to fix problems and evolve in a robust way.

Sweat contains salt (1g/L), so when exercising or in high temperatures, I need to eat more of it, or I&#x27;ll get fatigued and physical exertion will become impossible. (Sweat also makes exercise a confounder in studies that look at urinary excretion.)<p>Meanwhile, foods that we think of as &quot;salty&quot; are usually not actually salty, but rather, are designed to create salt pica.

There are also rules for &quot;slow play&quot; that generally keep a single turn from lasting too long—and inadvertently prevent certain weird combinations of cards from working.<p>Online play has what is effectively a chess clock. This doesn&#x27;t work in person because the game involves &quot;priority&quot; passing between players after <i>every single action</i>, which would be difficult to do manually.

The issue here is that your release procedure treats unstable features differently than everything else, making any crate or code that wants to use any unstable feature resort to using a nightly of some sort.  Admittedly, I can see reasons why this might be by design.<p>You might have good reasons why you think that won&#x27;t work or be useful (I can think of a few, such as not wanting to promote people building on a specific implementation of an unstable feature).  At a minimum, it is at least slightly more work to make sure this new item is released, depending on the release process.<p>P.S. The prevailing wisdom so far when wanting to use unstable features from a point release is to use a nightly form the same day, but the release policy seems to indicate that the nightly from that time is actually <i>two</i> release versions ahead of the stable that was released the same day:<p>> This process happens in parallel. So every six weeks, on the same day, nightly goes to beta, beta goes to stable.

If you get more than 3% value out of the incubator, it’s often a good idea to pay more than 3%.

Entrepreneurs would obviously benefit from more competition amongst incubators – and maybe you’re right that change is at hand.<p>I’m sorry that you didn’t get in to YC specifically (and maybe it wasn’t the right idea to apply, if you felt so strongly about how incubators provided so little value) – but I hope you won’t let your disappointment and anger get in the way of thoughtful business decisions, including in cases like future customer rejections.<p>Anyway, back to building our businesses – good luck with your own!",1453440092

10950859,comment,10943462,10943462,0,0,dr_,,,"My career is as a physician in post acute care settings. From my experience one of the biggest, if not the biggest, issue regarding home care for seniors is the cost. The agencies near us are rather expensive for most seniors. It&#x27;s covered by Medicaid for those who have it and some insurances provide benefits, but otherwise if you are a senior who needs care for several hours to 24 hours a day, you are typically paying about $20 an hour or $200 a day. Medicare does not cover it, and a lot of people cannot afford it. Which is why when we discharge people and make the recommendation for home care, and connect them with an agency, many patients and families do not follow through with it, beyond what their insurance may cover for a short period of time. \nMind you I realize this doesn&#x27;t mean the caregiver gets paid anywhere near $20 an hour or $200 a day, so I applaud Honors intentions of making them full time workers with, I hope, benefits. \nBut the bigger issue is how do seniors pay for these services? It will probably require a change at the level of CMMS.",1453439091
10950856,comment,10948588,10949850,0,0,dbaupp,,,"Yeah, the Cargo.lock file means that * constraints aren&#x27;t a problem until you need to update a library, e.g. to get an emergency bug fix. And, you are right that cargo update&#x27;s --precise option allows manually getting the same benefits of explicit requirements, but even doing this once seems like more work than just including the right version, especially with the risk of `update`ing wrong (although, again, Cargo.lock can save you here, if you&#x27;re tracking it in version control). The combination of `cargo search` (built-in) and `cargo add` (external, others have linked it) makes it pretty easy to just add the right versions at the outset.<p><i>> I&#x27;d also note that while theoretically restricting versions works, in practice having multiple versions of a single crate within a rust project often leads to build failures due to crate A having a public API that uses types from crate B, and crate C using both, but not getting the same version of B that A got. This leads to type errors at build time. </i><p>This <i>is</i> a problem, yes, but focusing on it by itself is somewhat of a red-herring: if A doesn&#x27;t restrict B&#x27;s version there&#x27;s no guarantee that A compiles against whatever version of B that happens to be chosen, i.e. you don&#x27;t even get to the point where there could be problematic interactions.<p>In any case, there has been serious discussion about how cargo can solve the problem of crates exposing other crates in their API, and the current proposed solution is to make cargo more strict about allowing multiple versions of such crates. #2064 is the relevant issue.<p><a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/2064"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/2064</a>",1453439061

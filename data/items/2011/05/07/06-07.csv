That gave the impression that unless you put a lot of effort into your language, it will probably be just a variant of C#/VB. The first versions of Eiffel for .Net lacked multi-inheritance and I think DBC was crippled somehow too. :-/",1304751340

2523322,comment,2523290,2523290,3,0,i386,,,"As much as I've enjoyed writing Grails apps and Groovy scripts, what I don't like about groovy is that it comes with a large runtime jar and its binaries are not really usable from java projects without API uglyness.<p>I wish Java had been designed with the same multi-language philosophy that .NET has had from the get go. Binaries produced in any language in .NET don't give any clues to what the language the binary was implemented in. For example, if your writing something using VB.NET and working with a library that was implemented in C# there really isn't any evidence that this is the case and the signatures look the same.",1304750739

You should think of systemd less as a &quot;program&quot; and more as a software compilation for the core system.<p>Yes, there is a chance that components of systemd could suffer bitrot, but I&#x27;d argue its less likely that a project under the tutelage of Red Hat in the interests of its enterprise crowd will see the rot that other projects like xinetd have in recent years, where major contributors just stop, the whole project grinds to a halt, but because its not part of some broader software project nobody notices to pick up the slack (note, my example has gone through periods of rot and revival when someone notices its become a problem). If one component starts rotting the bugs will pile up on the systemd bug trackers and the broader project will notice and respond more efficiently since everything in systemd uses the same semantics and code formatting and the developers will be more comfortable changing their working directory than their repository.",1424703130

First, they are taking an inherently trustless system and demanding a very high level of trust for AML/KYC requirements, which is unavoidable when dealing with fiat conversions.  Why not just trade directly in bitcoin (of course few people want to do this which is why coinbase exists)?  Specifically however, coinbase by default keeps your private keys under their control, which is where the bigger violation is IMO.  They push everyone to go through their service and not use bitcoin directly, so they can track and control everything.  The blockchain may or may not even be involved in some of their schemes (they offer a fiat-fiat service that supposedly involves bitcoin!).  This is inevitable, as they are a company out for profit not an idealistic bunch of ancap hackers, but they are not just looking at public blockchain data.

The AAAI is the Association of the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. Its annual conference is the worldwide gathering of university graduate students, and a few corporate labs, presenting their research in the disparate niche areas that have something to do with smart or human like behavior. All these niche areas have their own annual conferences,... Robotics, Planning, Semantic Web, Knowledge Representation, Natural Language Processing, pattern recognition, speech processing, theorem proving, and so forth.<p>GOFAI is &quot;Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence&quot;, and is used to represent the line of mostly symbolic AI research made popular by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and others back in the 1960-1970 era. It was those folks who as peer reviewers made Hinton&#x27;s life awful. The NIPS conferences over the years became the home for connectionist researchers, as opposed to the AAAI.<p>Now the wheel has turned full about. The triumph of Hinton&#x27;s approach allows him to tell thousands of young researchers that their own research approaches are finished unless they incorporate deep learning.",1424702748

It&#x27;s simply that the sticker price fails to represent the actual price of the product, a common practice throughout history. Once, it was common practice for handymen, construction firms, and automotive repair shops to hide additional costs in contracts. That practice went away quite fast as soon as consumer protection laws required that the cost was upfront and known to the customer. We can also see the exact same pattern with banking and travel, where hidden fees and surcharges was common practice everywhere until companies was forced to start informing customers.<p>If Lenovo laptops informed the customer prior to sale, then this would be a trade. They could have told the customer about the additional advertisement they would show on the sold device, how much they would earn, what private data they would transfer away from the device and sell. That to me is a difference in kind to what we have here, as I do not see an informed customer willingly accepting the adware deal.

9094452,comment,9092968,9093854,0,0,paulmd,,,"Yeah, number of eyeballs helps but it&#x27;s not a catch-all.  In some ways it could actually be a hindrance, since less-experienced eyeballs may not be able to mind all the necessary details, or may introduce further bugs/vulnerabilities.  For our purposes, these are &quot;bad programmers&quot;, whether or not they&#x27;re good programmers on other stuff.<p>A simple model for code quality is something like Q =(good programmers) / (good + bad programmers).  I would actually argue that it&#x27;s not even related to the average, and that bad programmers can degrade quality disproportionately to their actual number.  I think it might be something closer to Q = (good programmers)^2 / (good + bad programmers)^2.  This is what it seems like people are getting at with the whole &quot;negative productivity&quot; in the good/bad/10x programmer framework.<p>Openness/closeness of the source code isn&#x27;t the whole picture but the open-source model can more easily run into the too-many-cooks problem if the source is not properly gate-kept and reviewed in the aggregate.  Thus I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s entirely orthogonal.  Of course closed-source software is typically commercial, which runs into its own set of pressures that degrade code quality.<p>I think much more sophisticated testing systems are what will really boost code quality.  More advanced detection suites that throw more warnings, mandated full unit test coverage, plus CI frameworks that make sure that your code isn&#x27;t merged if it doesn&#x27;t clear the warnings and pass the full-coverage unit test.  Randomized address systems and mandated array-bounds checking that catch undefined behavior and off-by-one errors.  Basically, making things fail noisily instead of silently and forcing contributors to pay attention.<p>The C compiler in particular is really bad on the &quot;throwing warnings&quot; thing, even before you get yourself into other kinds of trouble.  As in, according to the C standard, &quot;rm -rf /&quot; (or literally any other behavior the compiler wants) is a valid output behavior if you miss a closing quote([1]), rather than a compile-time error.  That&#x27;s an absurd definition in a security-minded world, and that&#x27;s just the most egregious example of undefined behavior allowed by the C standard.<p>JVM-style managed code and declared exceptions are annoying but do seem to be a step in the right direction from a security perspective.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.regehr.org/archives/213"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.regehr.org/archives/213</a>",1424702128

Like a photo sharing site or whatever.<p>Things to include in your example app so you can learn the ins/outs of how rails does it:<p>- Nested models: comments on photos and how to organize the models, many to many relationships<p>- Rendering Partials: you can factor out pages into partials and essentially load them anywhere in the app<p>- Gems ecosystem: check out rubytoolbox (.com I think) for categories of gems.  These are like Java JAR files you can include via Maven.  The popularity and activity level are good ways to assess usefulness (outside of requirements)<p>- Host your own server: learn how Rails apps run on a server and different options for running it.  There are providers out there like Heroku where you can just deploy to them but I think it is best to understand how these work.  You probably understand how Tomcat or other Java containers work, where to look for log files, how it might interoperate with Apache HTTPD, etc.",1424702073

Nobody had adequately conveyed to me how these things work and what goes into actually building FCVs.

9094322,comment,9092567,9092567,0,0,keithnoizu,,,"I think the arguments for or against keeping full time architects on staff versus having developers who also work together to design out systems are the same the argument for or against separating out internal systems and test automation from regular developer roles. For example googles SET, STE & Engineer roles.<p>Personally I like more integrated teams and believe a good architect should be down in the mud writing code half the time in-between designing things out. Partially because technology keeps changing and you need to keep an eye on developments and partially because it&#x27;s a shame to waste that big picture understanding when tacking debugging or designing out specific components, and partially because it&#x27;s important to keep an eye on cod equality.<p>I&#x27;ve done the architecture thing both ways however, throwing design notes over the fence versus designing and helping with implementation, and honestly they both have their pros and cons.<p>Tighter integration reduces communication problems and wasted effort. On the flips side having individuals focus on producing what they produce best can be more efficient then forcing team members to wear multiple hats. For the same reason why a country much better at growing expensive widgets and slightly better at growing gaskets than another country should focus their production efforts on widgets while the other country focuses their production efforts on gaskets.<p>The major problem in my own humble opinion with the separating out the architecture discipline is that once you step away from the code you&#x27;re basically kicking off a countdown to the point where your understandings of the technologies involved and current practices and tools doesn&#x27;t match up with reality. Which impacts your quality as an architect.<p>You can say similar things about technical project managers, general managers and ctos who no longer code,",1424700510

cross validation, each time using one of the profiles for testing. Figure 5 is a confusion matrix, which shows a high success rate in classifying the routes. The achieved successful classification rate in this case was 93%.&quot;<p>So, given a bunch of known routes (like a stretch of highway), this algorithm is able to match your phone&#x27;s battery-usage signature to one of those routes, sort of like how a service like SoundHound is able to identify a piece of music based off of a few seconds&#x27; recording.",1424700304

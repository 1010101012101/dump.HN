2114790,comment,2112918,2114638,0,0,russ,,,"I don't have a breakdown with precise numbers for you, but some bloat comes from the fact that we include all of our templates in the phoenix bundle. Some savings could come from fetching certain components and pages on demand, but right now, we pull down everything.  Gzipped it drops to ~200k, which isn't terrible considering that this is fetched in parallel with API resources and the initialization of our cross-domain iFrame. We're currently working on getting our bootstrap time down, so the bundle size may be reduced as a result of that effort.<p>Re: DOM issues, when you switch around between pages and/or timelines, we detach the timeline DOM elements and keep a reference in memory.  Upon returning to a previously loaded timeline, we do a repaint (not bad). Right now, we don't employ any such technique for an active timeline that has been scrolled a long way down.  One thing we can do is detach large blocks of tweets that aren't in the viewport and splice them back in (while maintaining an accurate scroll height) if the user scrolls back up.",1295330229

I figured I would share it now to help me think of ideas as I go forward. Basically the idea of the site is to store everything about your day in a JSON object for a year.<p>Why you ask? Well, it would be cool to identify and trend habits, go back in time and see what you did on a given day and whatever else you could think to do with the data. How would you get it? I kind of worked some of that out.<p>I set the whole site up in phases:\n- 2 weeks = Voice memo everything I do\n- 1 week = Go through data and identify specifics to track based on habits. Build application to take in data and create a JSON object. \n- 3 months = Voice memo trackable items and enter them into application<p>At the end of all this you should have a decent result set of data that you could query on using MongoDB or something else. Obviously this would not benefit everyone, but I know it would me and hell, I am interested in the end results. If others are interested then please share your thoughts so when I pursue this I could bake them in.",1295330226

2114722,comment,2114120,2114569,0,0,jacques_chester,,,"> Actually the idea of a Royal Commission is just part of a smaller idea missing from US governance: the idea that an organ of the government can be completely non-partisan.<p>Yes, but they are rarely used, for two reasons.<p>1. They resemble the Star Chamber in their powers and setup. The Common Law has an unflattering cultural memory of this time in its history.<p>2. Their independence makes them dangerous to the commissioning government. For political reasons various watered-down sorts of inquiry are preferred instead.<p>> Royal Commissions are instigated by politicians, but they're expected to exist far above the fray of ordinary politics; certainly I've never heard of any accusations that a Royal Commission is biased one way or the other.<p>The Costigan Commission has been accused of bias, or at least going outside its terms of reference.<p>> Other examples of entities which manage in Australia to escape the partisanship which dominates them in the US are the High (Supreme) Court and the process for redrawing the boundaries of electoral districts.<p>I'm not sure why the HCA has avoided such a divisive culture as in the US. Probably because our jurisprudence has evolved in a quite different direction from the USA's in terms of constitutional interpretation. Simplifying grossly, the US model is ""realist"", taking the view that all judges are biased and that policy consideration affects judicial decisions; the Australian model is more ""legalist"", in that every attempt is made to ignore the policy implications and attend only to the law.<p>Of course in both countries the debate is far more complex and nuanced than that; but in Australia our judges have developed a theory of interpretation that blends legalism[1] and a general rejection of originalism/purposefulness[2]. This latter strand has caused the original design of the federation to be steadily turned inside out.<p>As for electoral boundaries, yes, having independent electoral commissions is a huge boon to our country and something that should be more widely replicated. In terms of electoral systems Australia is a world leader in many areas.<p>[1] Justice Sir Owen Dixon championed this view and shaped the post-50s court. He said upon becoming Chief Justice: ""Close adherence to legal reasoning is the only way to maintain the confidence of all parties in federal conflicts. It may be that the Court is thought to be excessively legalistic. I should be sorry to think that it is anything else. There is no other safe guide to judicial decisions in great conflicts than a strict and complete legalism"". His thinking in this case was shaped by the previous appointment of politicians to the High Court.<p>[2] Justice Isaacs introduced this mode of reasoning in the famous <i>Engineers</i> case.",1295328252

As crazy as it sounds, it would seem to be more likely to breed one from a Tasmanian Devil.  As marsupials are 'born' the size of a peanut, the actual parent wouldn't matter.<p>There has been articles floating around from time to time about a recreation of the Thylacine, but I think the stumbling block is the inability to get enough genetic information, despite the last living example living in captivity in 1936.  Legend has it that the corpse was thrown out with the trash, althogh I'm not sure I believe that.  You'd think they would have at least embalmed or frozen the corpse, but I guess 1930's conservation thinking didn't exist or was vastly different.<p>You can also find a rich litany of resources on the web of reported thylacine sightings, though none have ever been photographed accurately or verified.  It does seem somewhat likely that a small family or two still lives deep in the Tasmanian wilderness.",1295328140

Of course people are only human and have their biases, but if you create a social expectation that they'll be unbiased (and combine this with choosing the best people for the job -- old judges with nothing in particular to gain or lose and a well-earned reputation for impartiality) then they will be as unbiased as humanly possible.<p>The ""Royal"" in the title is no accident, though -- the traditions of the Commonwealth countries dictate that the Crown is above all politics, so anything expected to be above politics is always given a direct symbolic link to the monarchy.

Unless you're going to forcibly confiscate private property, people are not going to leave of their own accord - and even if they do, others will be happy to move in behind them.  So it's a choice of leaving things where they are, or suspending democracy, private property and freedom of choice and doing a dictatorial thing like clearing all the houses and buildings along the river and creating a park.  Even if you did it under existing laws, the amount of money required to resume all the properties would be immense.  Everyone of those riverfront homes is worth at least a million dollars.  The buyout and demolition would far outweigh any reconstruction costs.<p>These people know they live in a flood zone.  There are flood markers all over the place and every property purchase inclues a 1974 flood report as to the level of flooding in the particular property.  People choose to live in these place of their own free will in the full knowledge the river might one day come and flood them.<p>So a wide green belt along the river might be a good idea.

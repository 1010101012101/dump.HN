I can't tell you how many times we've been run around the ringer for discounts, extra support, customizations, etc. only to suddenly not hear from the person anymore, or find out they went with someone else with absolutely no explanation. That is all of course within the customer's rights, but experiencing this many times on the vendor side, you begin to grow cynical, and a policy of trying to be as supportive and helpful to everyone begins to slowly turn in to a more guarded and defensive posture and your first inclination is to look for someone trying to do an end-run around your pricing vs. someone simply looking for help for ""his daughter's video editing project.""",1291917569

1988339,comment,1987208,1987208,0,0,neworbit,,,"People who live much more mundane and low-visibility lives than Fred also have too many demands on their time and can't do everything they want to or feel like they should.<p>Seems like this is nearly everyone, in fact.<p>A VC's workload falls into several primary categories, which map back to groupings that are probably more familiar to those of us on the entrepreneur or employee side of the table: working with portfolio companies (Operations), prospecting for new firms (Marketing), screening new firms to decide if they want to invest (Purchasing), and raising capital for their next fund (Sales).<p>If you get good at this or even just high visibility, you can get deluged with new firms wanting your investment. Fred is good at building his brand and marketing himself/his firm, and now has the classic problem that we as entrepreneurs all want: too many customer prospects; even when winnowed down to the good ones, it's too many GOOD customer prospects - because a lot of people with good companies like Fred/USV and because Fred is largely actually doing well by his portfolio companies.<p>So what do you do when you have a high touch and/or service business and want to grow? If you have more leads than sales people to close them, generally you hire a good sales director, train some qualified folks on the idiosyncrasies of your business, and staff up your sales team to match. Some level of this is probably the right answer here, but unlike a conventional firm, USV can't do this on a large scale.<p>That sounds odd, doesn't it. But venture funds are limited in size. They have commitments from external investors to provide a certain amount of $. If they start garnering phenomenal interest and everyone wants investment from USV, Fred and others have to go raise a new fund. This is the gating factor on how much VCs can invest, how much they can afford to have a huge staff to assist in sourcing, screening, and closing companies. If you have a ton of capital to put to work, you have huge management fees and can afford more of a staff (as well as more $ in your own pocket).<p>So interestingly, Fred spends a while trying to jawbone down the price he pays for his share of companies. This is in one metric a good idea for him because he effectively gets a discount as to what the company is actually worth, but is causing a big chunk of the problem he faces. He's only got a certain number of dollars to spread around, and the more places he wants to invest in, the more his time is spent discovering and exploring those firms - let alone actually helping out with them. A busy VC is not an asset to the entrepreneur over and above the $ invested, whereas if he has time to focus on the startup firms that can be much more valuable. Ironically, success in VC generally makes you no longer ""smart money"" as you are just a distracted guy with a checkbook trying to juggle a dozen different board seats at once.<p>Fred would probably be better off getting a larger investment pool, putting larger chunks of money to work, adding the right team members to help scale USV, and focusing on making the portfolio companies more successful. His counterpoint is probably that investing smaller amounts and knocking down the valuation of the companies so that those smaller amounts buy bigger pieces of the firm gives the investors in the VC fund better returns. But it would be refreshing to see VCs focus more on adding value to and growing their portfolio companies, and realizing that more capital and more personal involvement are in fact a reasonable way to do that. Might even produce more value for everyone involved - fund investors, entrepreneurs, and VCs - as well as taking some heat off Fred to answer his email firehose personally.",1291917457

An Ad Hominem fallacy is suggesting that there is something wrong with <i>you</i> and that therefore your argument is wrong. You are entitled to any opinion you like. We celebrate iconoclasticism here, HN is all about people doing things most people do not like.<p>However, if you attempt to redefine the word ""climbing"" in a way that is entirely at odds with how everybody else uses the word, you can expect to encounter resistance. If the only climbing you respect is free soloing, have at it. I've free soloed, I respect it, I won't argue with that.<p>But if you're going to argue that everything else isn't climbing, well, that doesn't strike me as intellectually constructive. There is already an established vocabulary of terms for the various styles of climbing, and there is no visible need for throwing it all out and starting from scratch.<p>Now to address your second point. It's an important one, and a little research into climbing history reveals that this is a divisive debate going back over a century. Some people feel that risk is an essential component of the climbing adventure. Some do not.<p>There is a gymnastic pursuit that is carried out on plastic and on rock called climbing, and in modern times it can be carried out with little or no risk. So can cycling.  You can decide for yourself whether it is worth doing if there is no risk of injury or death.<p>There is also a thrill-seeking or adventure pursuit carried out on rock and in high, cold places. Proponents seeking adventure deliberately place themselves in harms way through free soloing, fast and light alpinism, and through placing protection that is of limited utility. Risk is not a black and white decision, most adventurers manage their adventure to expose themselves to a perceived tolerable amount of risk.<p>These two pursuits are both called ""climbing."" If you strongly prefer the latter to the exclusion of the former, you are not alone, but you also aren't in the majority.<p>So your question of why not build an escalator is easy to answer. The escalator removes the gymnastic element of the exercise and for those who seek adventure, removes too much risk.",1291915963

Domscheit-Berg quit the project this year due to disagreements with Assange’s policy and criticized him for giving some newspapers special access to the secret documents instead of publishing them all openly. Domscheit-Berg said OpenLeaks will create a decentralized system of secured mailboxes that will allow everybody to share any information without the risk of being tracked.

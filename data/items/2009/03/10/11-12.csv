I can't tell you why, other than the abstraction is infinitely easier to grok.<p>It does make me lazy though, but in someways there are benefits to that.  For instance, I work hard to find easier ways to write code.<p>I wouldn't recommend it for anyone, but I grew up smoking weed.  Also, quality plays a HUGE factor.<p>Moderation is key.",1236686297

509811,comment,509191,509191,0,0,maryrosecook,,,"Music is a terrible choice for a voting system.  The homogeny of opinion for sites like Hacker News or even Digg is way higher than any sector of music listeners, and it's this homogeny that aggregators depend upon to remain useful.  To put it another way: without curators, you need to all think alike.<p>The only way I can see this site working is for rankings to be calculated on a per-user basis, based upon the votes accrued from the user's neighbours.  This would go some way towards the mental filter I use for music recommendations from friends: do I trust this person's music taste?",1236685648

The nerd community is already familiar with the potential of SSD's and their speed increase. I think that the consumer market should be steamed ready for the 'next-gen' in hard disks via a video that's not focused on RAID configs, 6 TBs, a benchmark of 2GB/s and stuff. Focus on things like homevideo editing or working office, photo apps, mediaplayer and stuff all at once.<p>More exposure, more familiarity with the hardware and advantages, more potential buyers.",1236684389

There's a number hidden somewhere for the app store team, you call them and they will escalate the matter for you. It worked with 2 other companies we consulted for and it worked for my app.<p>I don't want to self promote here, but those who are interested in the book I co-wrote about this should check out the link in my profile.",1236684105

The seconds one demands mostly time, since debt is inevitable. To get the degree i have to learn.<p>I'd also like to work (d) on my project ideas, but there isn't enough time left after (a)-(c).",1236684070

220594,comment,220447,220584,0,0,skmurphy,,,"If you are based in California you end up paying both Delaware taxes and California taxes, you don't save anything by incorporating in Delaware, it's more expensive. Since you don't plan to take outside investment there would be no advantage to a Delaware incorporation. If you later change your mind you can always re-incorporate in Delaware (either due to outside investors' request or for other reasons).",1213772187

That means your company will have Cali law applied across the country (kind of, in certain areas).<p>I wouldn't worry if I was you. You can find a lawyer in California that knows California law more readily than one that knows Delaware. The majority of your legal issues will deal with employees, buying office space, etc. You don't need a Delaware LLC for that stuff. Delaware law won't even apply.<p>If you are going to take on funding or you hit it big and you are expanding, look at the Delaware LLC.

220574,comment,220390,220531,0,0,timr,,,"Part of the problem is that these tests aren't for specific diseases, and really <i>can't</i> be made more accurate.  Nobody knows what these genetic association studies mean on a clinical level.<p>For example, if a woman is found to have a SNP marker that is associated with breast cancer, you might conclude that she shouldn't take birth control, since that raises the risk.  But what if she <i>also</i> has a marker associated with ovarian cancer?  Hormone therapy helps with that.  What then?  There are dozens of stories like this one, and even doctors are over their heads when it comes to this stuff.  There's absolutely no chance that a layperson is going to be able to interpret the data of such a clinically dubious test.<p>It may not be the best idea to enforce a doctor's order for these things, but there's a legitimate argument to be made, and it goes well beyond a simplistic interpretation of personal liberty.  If enough people shell out for these scans, it's going to cause panic, over-medication and over-utilization of the medical system.  Again, it's a question of public health.<p>But don't take my word for it...here's a great editorial with some even better examples of the problems:<p><a href=""http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2004425391_geneticsop20.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2004425391_gen...</a>",1213769878

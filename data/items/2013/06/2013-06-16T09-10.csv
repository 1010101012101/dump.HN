If he dumped all the data at once, the story would blow over way faster. It&#x27;s also been helpful that other people have came semi forward, such as the Democratic congresswoman from California who basically pleaded for someone to leak for information because it&#x27;s that bad. This strategy also makes it easier to catch the U.S. government and company telling lies and contradictions. Also, it&#x27;s way harder to run damage control when you don&#x27;t know what information the other side has.",1371376734

Currently elevator shafts can reserve huge part of floor space. Down going cars could run motors in regenerative mode. So there&#x27;s no need for heavy counterweights or heavy ropes.

6308685,comment,6308425,6308425,5,0,rvivek,,,"Interviewing process is constant optimization just like every other workflow process in a company.<p>Disclaimer: I run interviewstreet.com which helps companies screen & hire programmers using coding challenges. We have had a substantially HUGE number of developers screened (might not be able to reveal the exact number) through the process and using the data points, here&#x27;s what we found (btw, this is also constantly optimized)<p>a. Asking a 5-year experienced engineer to solve a graph theory challenge or a complex tree problem is a pretty useless indicator.  The goal of such an interview challenge should be to test the problem solving skill of a candidate which is essential across any programmer role.<p>Can this person actually take an array of objects, perform an operation to get the result such that it works for any size of the array without throwing an exception? The data structures used in the question should be simple enough to start working on the challenge. You will be surprised how many errors, corner cases come up which are often missed. And as you gradually increase constraints, you can check their thought process of how their algorithm changes.<p>b. Make the problems interesting - put in actual effort to make the problems interesting, sometimes relevant to the problem you are actually solving. I often send this link to our customers(www.itasoftware.com/careers/puzzle_archive.html) and also help them design problems like this. That&#x27;s by far the most interesting publicly available challenges. The other one is Quora, quora.com/challenges which is slightly harder though but very interesting (and has proved very effective!)<p>c. Calibration: Surely github/bitbucket/SO profiles are important and can serve as a data point. However, it&#x27;s probably going to be very hard to calibrate. A web server coded in Python vs a new MVC framework written in PHP - who is a better candidate? Who has actually thought through the design of the problem better? It&#x27;s tough to evaluate. The programming challenge interviews act as a data point (one of the interview rounds) to check these skills in a contained problem/environment helping the company calibrate the performance against the rest of them.<p>The problems should involve a combination of the ability to write good code, focus on problem solving skills and not on remembering an algorithm from the CLRS text book, intelligent thinking (not to be confused with weird math/geometry problems unless your company is working on that domain) and <i>importantly</i> the ability to catch hints and solve it in a better way. This is a data point, an essential one but there are more to technical interviews.<p>If used in the right way, it can prove to be hugely effective for your process not only in streamlining but also as a way of generating interest from potentially interested programmers.",1377997165

6308680,comment,6304752,6307093,1,0,einhverfr,,,"Right but the T-shirt is saying, in effect, &quot;The Supreme Court said this was free speech.&quot;  It is arguably only expounding how far the boundaries of free speech go.<p>This is an interesting question because it gets to the heart of the question of how far free speech goes in school.  I have trouble imagining a court holding that summarizing and quoting from a Supreme Court opinion is not free speech and protected (and the hypothetical T-shirt clearly does this), but I am also pretty sure the Southern Poverty Law Center would sue in a second if the school didn&#x27;t take action.<p>This is an example of a hypothetical where significant legal arguments could mean both that the school <i>must</i> act and also that the school <i>must not</i> act.  It&#x27;s even possible a school could be sued and lose on both sides.<p>BTW, the states rights argument regarding the Civil Rights Act is more complex and it has to do with unconstitutional efforts to ensure ratification (refusing to seat Senators from non-ratifying states).  My view however is that these could have been raised early on and weren&#x27;t.  I think latches doctrine needs to apply at some point.  Otherwise we get to nitpick everything in history all the time.  The Equal Protection Clause should be included as a restriction of states&#x27; rights.

The ratio of good to bad programmers in India is the same as anywhere else[1].

A twitter feed is mentioned, which ended up consisting of posts such as &quot;and then God said&quot;, followed by some gibberish. This is actually a reference to a feature in one of his programs (a game I think) which allows one to &quot;talk to God&quot;. When you press the button, it simply randomly spits out words. On Reddit, the author asks people repeatedly to tell him what God said to them. He&#x27;s referring to this feature in his OS and obviously finds entertainment in hearing what words his program came up with for other people. This is reminiscent of fortune cookies. Strange behaviour perhaps, but not so nonsensical when placed in its context. As other people have pointed out, illness or not, this guy has managed to succeed at something highly nontrivial which most people will never do, at the pinnacle of Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs, namely &quot;Pursue inner talent; creativity; fulfillment&quot;. And whether or not some of his writings may be unintelligible, his code certainly passes a strict syntactic check.

6308655,comment,6308017,6308569,4,0,lutusp,,,"> Why is a finite set not random?<p>First, for a given finite set, one cannot say it&#x27;s not random, only that its randomness cannot be proven.<p>Let&#x27;s think a bit about what we mean by &quot;random&quot;.<p>* Is an even distribution of the digits 0-9, and no preferred sequential order, evidence for randomness? Yes, but not very good evidence.<p>* How about sequences of digits taken two at a time -- if each pair of digits is equally likely and shows no discernible pattern in their order, then we can say that the set meets the twin test.<p>* Now to triplets -- does each set of three digits show a complete absence of pattern, i.e. are 000, 001, etc. equally likely and have no preferred ordering?<p>Do you see where this is going? For any finite set size, the randomness tests must end when the digit sequence size to be tested equals the set&#x27;s finite size. That means we cannot fully test the set, and the reason is that it&#x27;s finite in size.<p>> What if it&#x27;s a random selection from the set of all sets?<p>Well,<p>* Typical examples drawn from an infinite random set won&#x27;t themselves be provably random. Consider if we draw three digits from an infinite, random set -- they won&#x27;t be likely to be random in isolation. Extend this to a selection of N digits from an infinite, random set -- as N increases, the probability of the selected set being random increases, but cannot be truly, provably random for any finite value of N.<p>* A random selection isn&#x27;t the same as a random set. If I randomly select a location within an infinite set, I have no assurance that my random choice of N digits will itself prove to be be random, therefore my having chosen a random starting point doesn&#x27;t either aid or hinder the process.<p>Consider these seeming paradoxes (not really paradoxical):<p>* Within an infinite random set, there will be an infinite number of examples (and repetitions) of infinitely repeating digits, i.e. infinite sequences of 1111 ... , 2222 ..., etc. In fact, if we accept the premise that the infinite set is in fact random, such repeating sequences <i>must exist</i> somewhere in the set, or the set is not random.<p>* Within an infinite random set, with appropriate search tools, we <i>will find</i> every book ever written or to be written, every state secret, every mathematical equation ever written or to be written, essentially everything. It&#x27;s a simple matter of knowing where to look.<p>Given these examples, if we choose an arbitrary index within the infinite random set from which to extract 40,000 numbers in base 26, we cannot be sure the extract will not be a work of Shakespeare with every word spelled correctly. Obviously that&#x27;s not a random subset. Therefore we cannot have any assurance that a subset of a random set is itself random.<p>Consider the infinite sequence represented by the digits of Pi. If we examine the digits of Pi expressed in base 26, where A = 0, B = 1, etc., it should be obvious that we will begin to see dictionary words of increasing size rather quickly in a practical search using present-day tools. To get a work of Shakespeare, one need only search more deeply.",1377995986

When we started the company we made a lot of assumptions about the demand for our product and the ease in which we were going to change bar culture.

That was the hardest thing to do.<p>Sure we were saving people time, and making the drink ordering experience more efficient (no cash, cards, open tabs and an easily-accessable drink menu), but what we learned is that people in bars are there primarily so socialize, and they don&#x27;t always need maximum efficiency like you do when you need a ride home (enter Lyft, Uber) or want lunch delivered (Seamless, GrubHub). People in bars like the social friction, and we were offering them a solution that took the social aspect out of the drink ordering process.

That is where religion comes in, which is fundamentally the psyche&#x27;s last grasp on reality by clinging onto hope in society. (Father, save me.)<p>The psychology involved is absolutely real, and the effects can be seen in any brainwashing victims who have had their will destroyed through deceit or betrayal. This is documented stuff- you can <i>make someone schizophrenic.</i> Ever been dumped by a girlfriend and felt &quot;lost&quot; for some time, losing some ability to reason? Congratulations, you have experienced damage to the psyche caused by emotional shock, otherwise known as &quot;heartbreak.&quot; This is what religion is referring to through the metaphor of the &quot;soul.&quot;<p>Furthermore, society has responded to this man&#x27;s determination and faith in redemption, i.e. &quot;God&#x27;s Will.&quot; We&#x27;re adjusting and slowly coming to accept his mental state and are beginning to appreciate the impressive effort put into his project. His faith is <i>working</i>, and in this we are both observing and are participating in the &#x27;miracle&#x27; of faith, which is due to the emotional bonds that humans create.<p>We are pack animals like many others in nature, we create family units, and we are essentially structured just like the natural world around us despite what we like to think about ourselves- our conscious thoughts are produced by our subconscious, we&#x27;re not in control, and we have no idea what the hell we&#x27;re doing except chasing a vision of success. Success in what, exactly?<p>Religion is not what you think it is! It is not entirely pointless superstitious nonsense, it is an ancient way of describing the matters of the pull of emotion from the heart and the effects it has on the human psyche through abstractions and metaphor. It is very difficult to understand except through experience, because it&#x27;s relying on a different state of the brain and attempting to describe feelings. People call it &quot;wisdom&quot; because that is the easiest explanation, since it is dealing with emotional states of the human mind that cannot be explained logically, only through abstract stories, warnings, and the like, same as Greek mythology (don&#x27;t fly too close to the Sun). Thou shalt not steal, because the subconscious guilt may eventually damage your trust in yourself and you may be cast out from your peers. (i.e. the Kingdom of God.)<p>Likewise, Hell is a metaphor for what happens when you are lost in the world with a shattered psyche, with no social bonds to pull you back up. It is a terrifying fate, and it certainly happened thousands of years ago to men just as it happens today- where do you think the minds of the homeless pushing around shopping carts are?\nModern psychology (at least some of it) is essentially a scientific explanation of the situations and consequences that the ancients described in the Bible.<p>It is not literal, nor did that have any meaning when it was written. It is the &quot;Word of God&quot; as again, a metaphor, describing the nature of human beings and their common behavioral patterns leading to predictable consequence.\nThe Old Testament is essentially an ancient Almanac, containing metaphor about the creation and nature of the universe, orally passed down legends and tradition about the beginning of mankind, a history of the fate of various sects and tribes and family lines of man originating from Israel, and collections of poems, songs, and Confucian-like snippets of wisdom collected by kings.<p>The traditions, symbolism, culture, music, and weird mannerisms of the church (or any religion in any culture) are there for a reason. They are symbols that affect the subconscious and evoke emotion, the same way that subliminally seeing a fast food sign in your peripheral vision will make your stomach rumble, and the reason why all advertising works.\nDescribed in an ancient way, this is <i>magic</i>. It&#x27;s real, and you&#x27;re exposed to it every day in both positive and negative forms.<p>The &quot;house of religion&quot; where participants submit into a particular culture of tradition gives humans in various situations and walks of life something to bond together with, creating a social family unit i.e. &quot;children of God, flock, congregation, etc.&quot;\nThis feeling is subconsciously <i>uncomfortable</i> to the logical crowd like this one, which is compromised of young men driven by their very nature to break free of their parental family unit and create their own, while <i>not realizing</i> that is exactly what they are doing or where their ambition comes from. They are clinging to their <i>confidence in themselves</i>, and if that doesn&#x27;t pan out, the only thing left to hold onto is hope in the compassion of your fellow man as a collective.\nIt is sort of like a recursive self-deception where people place their faith in their own emotions (God&#x27;s name is Jealousy) which actually works and helps people pull themselves back out. Hard to wrap your mind around the illogical!<p>Let&#x27;s not disappoint the man. He deserves recognition, and it is in our very nature to give him a hand and pull him out of his rut. Perhaps he will even find a woman to bond with, set up a steeple above their heads in &quot;holy matrimony,&quot; and become a King himself.",1377994426

9557942,comment,9556459,9556459,0,0,gjm11,,,"The article mentions the fairly familiar fact that &quot;median is to L1 as mean is to L2&quot; -- i.e., the mean is the point from which the total squared error is minimized, and the median is a point from which the total absolute error is minimized.<p>I was telling my 8-year-old daughter about that the other day, and it occurred to me that the other &quot;measure of central tendency&quot; children get taught about, the mode, <i>also</i> fits into this scheme, with a tiny bit of fudging. Define the L0 error to be the sum of the 0th powers of the errors, with the (unusual) convention that 0^0=0. In other words, the L0 error is just the <i>number of data points you don&#x27;t get exactly right</i>. Then the mode is the value that minimizes the L0 error. So: L0 : L1 : L2 :: mode : median : mean.<p>(Note 1. The obvious other Lp norm to consider is with p=infinity, in which case you&#x27;re minimizing the <i>maximum</i> error. That gives you the average of the min and max values in your dataset. Not useful all that often.)<p>(Note 2. What about the rest of the &quot;L0 column&quot; of Ben&#x27;s table? Your measure of spread is the number of values not equal to the mode. Your implied probability distribution is an improper one where there&#x27;s some nonzero probability of getting the modal value, and all other values are &quot;equally unlikely&quot;. (I repeat: not actually possible; there is no uniform distribution on the whole real line.) Your regression technique is one a little like RANSAC, where you try to fit as many points <i>exactly</i> as you can, and all nonzero errors are equally bad. I doubt there&#x27;s any analogue of PCA, but I haven&#x27;t thought about it. Your regularized-regression technique is &quot;best subset selection&quot;, where you simply penalize for the number of nonzero coefficients.)",1431816761

The tutorial itself has been vetted by people who worked on the simulators though -- thanks to Lidnariq, Quietust, and BigEd!)<p>The basic logic elements tend to be more involved in CMOS, which makes use of symmetrical pairs of transistors with different doping. (Roughly, the doping determines whether a high or a low voltage &quot;closes&quot; the transistor.) Compare the implementation of a NOT gate for NMOS and CMOS here for example (where &#x27;a&#x27; is the input): <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverter_%28logic_gate%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverter_%28logic_gate%29</a>.<p>To get an idea of one problem with NMOS that CMOS solves, consider the inverter example when the input is high.

CMOS on the other hand is designed to only draw power while the circuit is switching. Studying the circuit on the wiki article might give some rough idea of how that works.",1431816752

There was widespread speculation that the ISI knew Bin Laden&#x27;s location, even right after Bin Laden was killed. The story about the Pakistani general defecting seems to have been reported by others and seems reasonably plausible.<p>Some other portions of Hersh&#x27;s story just don&#x27;t seem plausible to me (the Vox piece made a number of these points and more, but personally I think these are the strongest). If Bin Laden was under ISI control, I don&#x27;t understand why the Pakistanis would have wanted the US to send in SEALs to kill him in Abottabad when they could have just put him on a helicopter and had the SEALs kill him in Afghanistan. That would have avoided all sorts of embarrassment to the Pakistani military and intelligence services. The fact that the US penetrated Pakistani air defenses was very embarrassing to the Pakistani military, as was the fact that Bin Laden was living practically down the street from a Pakistani military academy - not to mention that it seems strange that the Pakistanis and Americans would have chosen to undertake all the risks of discovery of sending helicopters in to a peaceful town when the ISI, which was supposedly guarding Bin Laden, could have just quietly taken him to a remote area.<p>The business about SEALs dumping parts of his body out of a helicopter also seems strange - given how politically charged the mission was I would imagine that they would have been incredibly disciplined and professional. And Hersh&#x27;s explanation for the breach in US/Pakistani relations following the mission just seems convoluted and implausible. It seems very plausible to me that the US went in and killed Bin Laden without Pakistani knowledge, and that the mission caused the breach. Hersh&#x27;s explanation just seems like he&#x27;s building up a whole convoluted series of explanations to justify his theory.",1431815318

It&#x27;s around 1800, and the medium of exchange is letters.<p>Laplace has recently shown that the integral of minus t squared, where t goes from minus to plus infinity has a definite answer.<p>Gauss starts a paper, basically says, let&#x27;s just run with the arithmetic average, the usual mean, as the go-to best estimate, from a big series of measurements of a single thing, each of which has errors, because, yeah, why not.<p>Moments later the guy shows that squaring the errors makes it equivalent to that thing Laplace did, and we now have a general rule. His argument follows by supposing each repeated error due to a specific cause has an expected error of zero, with no particular rule of distribution, but that as the number of specific causes goes to infinity, the Law of large numbers applies (go Euler, fair play). Hence, wiggley wiggley, Laplace&#x27;s thing.<p>Beautiful piece of work, and resting on Laplace and Euler too, two other heroic oddballs.<p>The best thing is the underlying explanation: Take a nearly-infinite number of different measurements of a thing, each measurement with its own pattern of rubbishness, and the average of those measurement will approach having this distribution. That bit is what makes it so broadly applicable.",1431814041

So we have an absurd situation where a non-trivial amount of Spanish toponyms are more accurate in the English Wikipedia than in the Spanish one.<p>In the global context, this is probably a small issue.

I agree, for targeting that explicitly as a  pedagogical or philosophical end in itself.\nA cool ideal, btw (though I think it works better with less powerful programming - more concrete, perhaps only regular or context free not turing complete).<p>In real (non-coding) life, there's usually overlap, of ""adjustments"". e.g. you're cutting tomatoes with a knife, and adjust the knife's angle, or your grip, or move the tomato, spin it on a vertical axis, rotate it, try sawing vs slicing, maybe change knives, etc. Perhaps you exclaim ""This is the best knife for tomatoes!"" and resolve to use only it henceforth. But many of these adjustments are unconscious, and part of everything we do. Is it ""operation"" or ""design""? I think it's fuzzy in practice; we often chip away at things as we learn and adapt.<p>True, in software, there's usually a sharp line between user (operating) and programmer (designing). Customization crosses that line: macros, templates - even, hiding menus you don't use.\nIs hiding a menu ""programming""? While not turing complete, it's a step closer to it.<p>I agree there's not much market for the combination, in itself. Programming is so accessible these days, if you want to do it, you just do it. Probably starting with HTML ""programming"", then Javascript or PHP. It even looks like a real website! It's like hypercard, but global.",1322887687

3306934,comment,3305328,3306903,1,0,jarek,,,"The thing about high rises is that they require money to put them up, especially in seismically active areas. Typically the cost is such that an apartment in a high rise takes at least several years to fully pay off when paying off a mortgage with payments of the equivalent of today's monthly market rent.<p>Relax regulations, clean out zoning, remove market controls, employ people on the black market, do the construction not-for-profit and you might be able to slash the cost by half or maybe two thirds, probably not more. (There is a finite amount of people willing to pay to live in such a high rise, but let's assume demand really is huge.)<p>In particular, even at that lower construction cost it won't be worth it for anyone to build if the rent is to be comparable to maintenance costs, whether through supply/demand or otherwise. This will be the case until you can put up high rises at a total cost of about $900-1200 per unit (roughly 15-20 times the monthly payment), no matter how many you can put up.",1322887375

Statistics reported by agencies are often interpreted incorrectly. The companies who run the survey are often biased and perform the tests incorrectly.  I've been pitched statistics by marketers plenty of times and they usually don't know what they're talking about.<p>Nevertheless, your article goes to show that the spending gap between men and women in online social gaming is pretty small.  My article mentions that women tend not to play console and PC games as much as men do, which supports the opinion that EA is not a good comparison point for Zynga.<p>I wish I could get male/female spending demographics for Dave & Buster's, but it would probably be closer to social gaming than console/PC gaming.  Although you'd have a tough time teasing out money from men (husbands/boyfriends) who pay for their female companions vs. men on themselves.<p>Edit: Many years ago when I played Everquest some friends had a discussion of why so few women play games.  One guy answered, quite aptly, ""By putting scantily-clad big-breasted cartoon women and monsters bashing each other on the cover they catch the attention of men.  If they wanted to bring more women in, then they should have smiling people sitting around a table and cooperating with one another.""",1322887209

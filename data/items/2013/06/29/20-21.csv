I feel like Java owes its current following to its entrenched position in a broad array of corporate and government IT departments.

Types provide substantially stronger guarantees without having to execute any code.<p>> The type system does need more information from the user to allow the same kind of flexibility in a type safe environment.<p>Did you have a look at Haskell? Or any other language with type inference?\nThe connection you are trying to establish between &quot;untyped == no need to specify types explicitly&quot; and &quot;typed == necessary to specify types explicitly&quot; is patently wrong.<p>Having a helpful compiler doesn&#x27;t mean that the language has to suck.

Maybe there&#x27;s some art to finding the right balance.<p>It&#x27;s a fascinating idea, to have a story that is shaped by the players actions, incorporating them as significant plot points in a story - so that <i>whatever</i> the player does is given meaning in the story. Sounds nice... but to do it, you some kind of a &quot;grammar&quot; of stories, and a way to recognise player actions (not to mention actually getting it to generate a story, a sentence of the grammar).<p>Perhaps one way to recognise player actions is with a constrained world, such as a point and click (or text) adventure, with pre-defined nouns and verbs.<p>So, you pick something up, and it <i>becomes</i> the solution to a puzzle; whoever you meet <i>becomes</i> a mentor, ally, enemy, depending on what the story needs at that point; you do nothing, and things come to you; you go somewhere and it <i>becomes</i> a threshold to a special world; you do something difficult (e.g. it takes a few steps to get to it), and it yields a greater reward.  The player seems to be trying to achieve something (how to detect that? Things seen in the distance, or mentioned, or written or implied, with directions, and the player goes that way), you make it more difficult.<p>Such things usually turn out obviously cookie-cutter, because it is by definition without creativity. But perhaps with a sufficiently large database and orthogonal grammar, it would be no more derivative than many popular films/novels.",1372538558

Granting for the purpose of discussion that the current revelations about NSA in the United States appear to show a slippage to worse conditions from the legal restrictions that originally governed NSA&#x27;s activities related to Americans living in America, is it genuinely correct, as the article claims, that &quot;idealists have, as the Washington saying puts it, &#x27;nowhere else to go&#x27;&quot; besides supporting one major United States political party or the other?<p>My observation of history is that third-party political movements in the United States have never won the Presidency  or a majority in Congress since the fragmented election of 1860 that began the current &quot;two party&quot; system, but the two parties have changed everything about their positions on policy while keeping their names the same. The Democratic Party and Republican Party went through a complete role reversal with each other on many issues from the 1890s to the 1990s, and third-party movements in the United States continue to nudge the parties to respond to popular discontent. United States political parties are not ideological, and have no ideological test for membership. Political parties in the United States are coalitions to aid the efforts of individual candidates to win elections. My state has been governed by a third-party governor quite recently, and I have voted for candidates who are genuinely independent of any party, and candidates endorsed by SEVEN different political parties, in state and federal elections since the 1970s.<p>As for a broader question about where freedom is available to the common people, what do immigration patterns tell us? The United States is a rare example of a country that has consistent, sustained population growth irrespective of natural increase through immigration. Tens of millions of people around the world have responded to public opinion surveys to indicate that they desire to immigrate to the United States. The United States gains population on a net basis in comparison to almost any other country. If there is a freedom problem here in the United States, where is there not a freedom problem?",1372537542

I told him by phone that i can not do this with him. That i have a really bad feeling and do not want to do this with him. That i like to work with him but that we have two different views on entrepreneurship and how to build a startup. He threatened with a lawyer and said that he promise to &quot;destroy&quot; me when i would do this. \nHe added two persons to the team, tried to create a partnership and wrote round about 20 lines of the business plan. Nothing more, in one year.<p>Now, six months later i begin to struggle again with the fact to have him in the team. It blocks me mentally. It demotivates. It feels bad. We are two months away from our launch and i really need some advices how to handle this. Should i contact a lawyer? Should i just say &quot;Goodbye&quot; and hang up the phone?<p>What do you think?

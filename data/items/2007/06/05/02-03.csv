While I know that women receive more diplomas than men, it's completely unclear to me whether they are coming up with the majority of the new ideas in the field. They might be, I just don't know.<p>2) This seems like it would only help for women specific startups. How many women specific startups are there left to create?<p>1) I believe that men are, compared with women, more likely to be competitive as opposed to cooperative. That being said, only a very small subset of men start Web 2.0 businesses, and I'm betting they are already much more cooperative than average. At least this would make sense, since it having a cooperative mindset would seem to be an advantage in putting together a diverse team to create something of value.<p>That being said, women probably would do well to start more startups. I can never understand why women complain that only 2% of fortune 500 CEOs are female, instead of complaining that only 2% of high growth startups are founded by women.<p>Also, it drives me nuts when I see girls I'm friends with buying business books specifically for women. While I've never read one, I can't imagine they are any good, at least compared to the normal Seth Godin / Guy Kawasaki / Paul Graham / Joel on Software / etc. (If they were any good, men would read them too. After all, it's the same process...)",1181011280

(I know I've tried to add comments in articles as I've posted them, but gave up because of the number I submit. I do read them but now comment sparingly.)   There is a real problem with generating volumes of information quickly. If you want speed,  there is a limit on the amount of <i>meta</i> information a user can reasonably generate. If you want usefulness, this requires more time on behalf of users submitting.<p>Newspapers have this problem and solved it by training news editors to create <i>catchy titles</i> that neatly summarises the entire article in a small sentence - maybe even a few words. But not everyone writing articles on the web is trained in Journalistic techniques, let alone people who read this site.  There is also the other problem when re-phrasing or changing titles of articles. Mutilating them into something un-recognisable from the original.<p>This is where the software has to work harder. By supplying users with the tools to classify, sort and value the submissions with tags, comments, summaries (already have ranking).  I'm thinking here of delicious where tagging has allowed users to sort quickly by tag, then if they want to add more data themselves (descriptions, summary). The other way is to gather meta data from the source document (tags, microformats) where possible (un-likely as it takes time to process documents to generate useful things like summaries - even longer for meta data like microformats). Now the question is,  <i>could</i> ""pg with news.yc create some tools to help users or process new submissions extracting meta-data""?",1181009770

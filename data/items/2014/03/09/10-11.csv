7368127,comment,7367438,7367438,6,0,human_waste,,,"I was bullied at grade school all the time, I was a poor, fat kid and my parents had just divorced, I was happy and optimistic, but very vulnerable. I won&#x27;t go too much into the details of this, because this post is already too long. But as a result and the point of this post is that I became a bully myself.<p>I didn&#x27;t have friends there and as a result I hanged around with the kids on my neighborhood. They were all younger than me and quite a lot of immigrants and others with not that much of a &quot;social standing&quot; and I could get an easy hold over them just by the power of seniority. Then, when I went to a middle school and the scenery changed, I had become an alpha male in that sense that I knew how to rule over people with fear and verbal abuse. I didn&#x27;t do it consciously, it just had became a part of how I act.<p>Bullying is about abusing other people&#x27;s weakness&#x27;. I had became a master of it. I never actually did anything myself, I just talked, other kids did stuff for me. Physical abuse like &quot;Hey I know, let&#x27;s fill your backpack with all of our books and hit that guy in the face with it!&quot;. Stealing shit from school like computer equipment, cigarettes and candy from grocery stores. There were even plans to rape certain girls. Perhaps the only time I thought I maybe had gone too far was when a &quot;friend&quot; of mine bought a gun to school.\nThe way the school tried to control me was to talk to the people around me. My closest acquaintance was this huge football guy and the principal frequently took him into talks and tried to get him to stand up against me, he always came back to me to tell it and my reaction was pretty much &quot;Haha what would you do you fucking fag?&quot;. In reality, if even one person had said anything or done anything to me, I would&#x27;ve completely crumbled down, because inside I was still that bullied little fat kid trying to fit in.<p>What I&#x27;m most ashamed is the bullying I inflicted on one kid that was born with his legs different height and as a result, he didn&#x27;t walk very good. Easy target.\nAlso, my own little sister. She was the first one in line always. We fought so much that she eventually had to move away to live with my father.<p>Later on in life, I found out that the kid who began the cycle of hatred, my original bully, had a very abusive big brother.<p>I&#x27;ve gone through clinical depression, severe anxiety and drug abuse at my adult life to truly find out who I am and I feel that a lot of it was residual from my childhood, as it usually is.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to justify anything, but if you are in that period in your life where you don&#x27;t really know how life works, there&#x27;s nobody to show you and the only experience that you have is dog eat dog, then that&#x27;s what you become.",1394362658

But generally programmers can bring tangible value in a way that few professions outside of sales can do, so I never felt a strong need for alpha behavior and posturing to acquire status.  What is needed is to work in a company that understands how to leverage technology, and the rest should take care of itself.  Programmers are in such high demand now that companies which don&#x27;t know how to use them and fundamentally value them will get stuck with the bottom of the barrel, leading to a negative feedback loop.",1394362629

7368109,comment,7362613,7364465,3,0,robn_fastmail,,,"> &quot;needing ... supporting IdPs (email providers)&quot;<p>Over at FastMail we seriously looked into implementing Persona across the board. We&#x27;re one of the bigger &quot;small&quot; email providers and we figured that it would be a good thing to get in on the ground floor if it succeeded, and have a(nother) feature to differentiate us from our competition, and to be able to give feedback on the system from the iDp perspective.<p>The hard requirement for HTTPS or DNSSEC is what raised the bar too high for us in the end (see <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/persona/issues/1523"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/persona/issues/1523</a> for more info). Basically, the domain owner needs to securely delegate to the identity provider. Since we provide DNS and basic web hosting for most user domains, that means we have to provide HTTPS certificates for every domain we manage (and at least one IP per domain) or be able to serve proper DNSSEC records for every domain we manage (difficult when many registries we use still don&#x27;t support it).<p>DNSSEC is something we&#x27;re working towards, and I&#x27;d really like to have full support available this year. HTTPS without needing one IP per domain and multiple certificates is still not yet feasible, though there are specs gradually coming down the pipeline for it (DANE, DNA, POSH, etc). Without all this tech in place, Persona seems to be a non-starter for a IdP that wants to manage lots of domains.<p>I don&#x27;t blame the Persona guys for this. I know they tried and they got a lot of it right, and should be applauded for that. Maybe the next round of federated authentication will work. I have no idea, but I know we&#x27;d still like to be involved, and we&#x27;ll be watching the space with interest.",1394362109

(disclaimer: I&#x27;m an XMPP board member).<p>There are three problems to solve:<p>1. knowing when to retrieve messages (push notifications)<p>2. retrieving messages (message archive management)<p>3. synchronising messages between devices (what this solves)<p>More background: XMPP is designed around keeping a connection open to the client and pushing through updates and new messages. These assumptions worked well in a desktop environment on a solid TCP connection. But for power, intermittent network, and mobile OS design reason, holding open a socket isn&#x27;t ideal.<p>Push notification work because the OS provider (Apple, Google, Mozilla etc.) keep one socket open and then push through important notifications. This keeps the phone&#x27;s radio from powering up for silly things like &quot;contact came online/went offline&quot; type messages.<p>A push notification might be &quot;xyz posted ... &quot;. Your phone needs to now come online and synchronise messages that might have been posted on your tablet or desktop client. Hence XEP-0280. It helps resync messages from other clients.<p>The XSF is also writing up a push notification XEP that makes it easy for mobile apps to use XMPP as a signalling channel and throw out push notification where necessary.",1394361855

7368096,comment,7365812,7367147,9,0,cornholio,,,"> There are also 255 representations of almost all representable numbers. For example, 10 is 1 x 10^1 or 10 x 10^0 – or any one of 253 other representations.<p>You are not correct. The smallest significand possible is 1x10^1, but you can&#x27;t delve further into positive exponents. Conversely, 56 signed bits allows the largest integer power of 10 as  10 000 000 000 000 000 so the exponent will be -15. So there are exactly 17 representations of 10, and that&#x27;s the worst it gets. All other numbers except powers of 10 have fewer representations, and most real world data affected by noise has a single representation because they use the full precision of the significand, and you can&#x27;t shift them to the right or left without overflow or loss of precision.<p>So the redundancy is much less than you think, one in 10 real values has two representations, one in 100 has three etc. This is common for other decimal formats and not that big of a problem, detecting zero is a simple NOR gate on all significant bits.<p>The real problem with this format is the very high price in hardware (changing the exponent requires recomputing the significand) and complete unsuitability for any kind of numerical problem or scientific number crunching. Because designing a floating point format takes numerical scientists and hardware designers, not assembly programmers and language designers.<p>Heck, the only reason he put the exponent in the lower byte and not the upper byte, where it would have ensured a perfect compatibility to most positive integers, is that X64 assembly does not allow direct access to the upper byte.",1394361707

You can kill the entirety of the original team and not be in dire straits, provided they die over the course of several years.<p>If an entire team dies at once, there&#x27;s no one to pick up the slack, and no one to train replacements.<p>It is both unlikely that an entire team will be on a commuter bus at once, and even if they were, it is unlikely that a bus crash would kill all of them.<p>Plane crashes, in contrast, have a nasty habit of killing everybody on board all at once.",1394360735

7368047,comment,7365801,7367708,5,0,Karn,,,"Further info in support of the above comment:<p>- The Mig had been manufactured in February 1976 and thus was one of their latest most sophisticated production aircraft.<p>- Transistor circuitry was not used but instead the Soviets relied on vacuum tubes for most of their electronics.<p>- The Soviets reasoned the vacuum tubes were less affected by EMP waves in the case of nuclear attack; were more resistant to temperature extremes and they were easy to replace in remote airfields where transistors may not be readily available if repairs were needed.<p>- Welding was done by hand.<p>- Rivet heads were exposed in areas not critical to parasitic aerodynamic drag.<p>- Pilot forward vision was highly obstructed.<p>- With huge Tumansky R-15D-300 engines the Mig was considered almost a rocket.<p>- Pilots were forbidden to exceed Mach 2.5. There was a total of three engine instruments and the airspeed indicator was redlined at 2.8 Mach.<p>- Above Mach 2.8 the engines would overheat and burn up. The Americans had clocked a Mig-25 over Israel at Mach 3.2 in 1973. Upon landing in Egypt, the engines were totally destroyed. We did not understand that the engine destruction was inevitable.<p>- The combat radius is 186 miles.<p>- Without using afterburner; staying at optimum altitude and not maneuvering, the Mig can fly in a straight line for 744 miles.<p>- The plane was so heavy at 64,200 pounds, that according to early rumors Soviet designers had to eliminate a pilot ejection system. However this was disproved.<p>- Most MiG-25s used the KM-1 ejector seat. The last versions used an early variant of the famous K-36 seat. The speed record for the fastest successful ejection (Mach 2.67) is held by a KM-1 equipped MiG-25.<p>- Maximum operational altitude: Carrying two missiles, 78,740 feet (for maximum two minutes duration); carrying four missiles, 68,900 feet is maximum.<p>- Maximum altitude of missiles: 88,588 feet.<p>- Ability to intercept an SR-71: Belenko states the Mig-25 cannot intercept the SR-71 for several reasons: The SR-71 fly too high and too fast; the Mig cannot reach it or catch it. The missiles lack the velocity to overtake the SR-71 and in the event of a head on missile fire (The Golden BB), the Guidance system cannot adjust to the high closure rate of the SR-71.<p>- The Mig-25 has a jam proof radar but cannot distinguish targets below 1,640 feet due to ground clutter. The radar was so powerful it could burn through jamming signals by approaching bombers.<p>- Maximum G load: With full fuel tanks 2.2 G&#x27;s is max; with near empty fuel tanks, 5 G&#x27;s is dangerous. The Mig-25 cannot turn inside a U.S. F-4 Phantom fighter!<p>- The plane was made of steel alloy, not high temperature titanium, although strips of titanium was used in areas of high heat concentration.<p>- In a tight turn the missiles could be ripped from the wings.<p>- The Mig-25 was was not a fighter or an air superiority aircraft but rather designed by the Soviets to climb at tremendous speeds, fire missiles at one pass of the target and then land.<p>- Search and tracking radar had a range of 55.9 miles.<p>- The pilot duties were to take off, turn on the auto pilot and await instructions to fire the missiles from ground controllers. The Mig-25 had a superb auto pilot and digital communications from an onboard computer to ground controllers.<p>- Credit is given to the Soviets for building a high altitude Interceptor in a short period of time with the materials and engines available to them in 1967 in order to counter the perceived threat of the XB-70.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.wvi.com/~sr71webmaster/mig25.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wvi.com/~sr71webmaster/mig25.html</a>",1394359745

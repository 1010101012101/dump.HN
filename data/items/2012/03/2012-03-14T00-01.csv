3701227,comment,3701119,3701119,1,0,cobychapple,,,"Disclaimer: I deliberately didn't read your description above to emulate the impression I'd get if I turned up without knowing anything about your site.<p>That said, I think you're focusing too much on what/how people post content on Wehgee, and not nearly enough on the benefits people can expect from sharing content this way. For example, Twitter's landing page says ""Find out whats happening, right now, with the people and organizations you care about"", and Facebook ""helps you connect and share with the people in your life.""  both of these are very direct ways to introduce the product.<p>In contrast the way your describe yours seems purely functional: I know that with Wehgee I'm suppost to share stuff in 6 weekly topics, and that by doing so I'll be ""shaping the conversation"" but that has no relevance to me whatsoever and doesn't communicate a benefit to me of any kind.<p>Also, I think you need to be clearer about the distinction between a category and a topic. Initially I thought that the hashtags were the 6 categories, but it took me a while to work out that this wasn't the case, and that the two were separate. I think you need to first make it clear what categories of content there are, and then find a way to distinctly communicate what the <i>current</i> topic is for that category.<p>Another point: How do I know when one week's topic ends and the next begins? Is it on a Monday? Sunday? Can I revisit topics/discussions from past weeks?<p>I think there's some serious potential to giving people a framework of topics/categories to use for posting content, I just think you could find a clearer way of articulating the benefits of this approach.",1331686672

When you think about it, Facebook is a closed system. They want CNN to post articles into the CNN FB stream. They want people to read those articles on the CNN page (yes, this currently links to outside FB... that will change).

Disbarment... who knows. If one has gotten the short end of the stick in a patent dispute, I guess it could make him dislike patent attorneys.<p>> No. You miss my point. Not even Congress could do it. If Congress passed a law, the patent bar would simply work around it and continue its present practices.<p>There's simply no reason to believe this. If Congress made a clear law prohibiting software patents, and it was a well-drafted law, then it would be followed.<p>> Germany before 1877. China now.

Kind of like teenagers when they realize that finding a job is suddenly not an 'optional' thing in their lives.<p>James' rant here reminded me of a similar rant I read (internally) at Sun on its 10 year anniversary. They had published a book all about Sun's first decade, and somehow excised the fact that Sun had built a workstation called the 386i. It emphasized the successes, and papered over the mistakes. The rant was about how Sun, who had kicked DEC in the nuts and had them retreating to the data center, was walking right into that same data center because Microsoft was starting to make PC's as useful as workstations. (there used to be a real distinction there.)<p>I remember thinking that somehow Sun had gone from bringing technology to the folks who could use it, to being all about being a more impressive Sun Microsystems. Sun's ""Google+"" moment was the day they announced they were going to merge System V and SunOS.<p>In my brief time at Google I was exposed to the folks who had become more about 'The Google' and less about doing cool stuff.

Google did the same with search, make it real, then monetize.<p>But I think at some point the operating committee at Google looked at monetization of all the things Google has done and if you included search advertising the in the bar graph everything else looked like zero.

So maybe I could set up some simple framework with a JS Canvas and see if they'll bite. Maybe even better would be just to code some simple game for myself, for fun, show it off, and I already know of at least two kids that will try real hard to figure out how I pulled that off, and they'll be happy to find out it was written inside the same HTML tags they wrote their website with :) (another good reason is, before I caught the Python-bug, I was coding JS all day :) )<p>Anyway, thanks again for your explanation!",1331684557

My journey goes like this:<p>First machine was a Sinclair ZX80 with 1K ram, a bubble keyboard that hooked up the television. No sound, basic for language (using peek/poke for accessing h/w) and tape deck to load programs. Very simple and fun to play with. Hooked ever since.

69324,comment,69273,69323,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"For one, Demo Day is definitely NDA-ed. Other stuff, the business and marketing help that JL provides or the technical help that PG provides, those would also be considered under NDA, unless it's generic enough that sharing such information wouldn't hurt the startups. <p>YCombinator's interest is in the exit of the companies it funds. It's from that money that they can continue to do this year after year. Giving away everything in the farm doesn't help them do that. As much as everyone makes sharing and collaborating such a big deal, here in Silicon Valley people are actually pretty mum about their plans. Put it another way: if someone insists on talking to you about startups and whatnots around here, it's cause you're getting pitched. ",1192660177

Ok so this house is incredibly efficient in energy and space use and I really like the design of the interior.  You would think then that it would also blend well with the landscape and not stick out like a sore thumb.  However all you see from the outside is is a rectangular box that you only get to pick the color of.  I just think the exterior lines are a bit harsh and out of place for something that is otherwise so well designed.",1192658750

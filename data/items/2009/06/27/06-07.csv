People are dying every day because life and death healthcare runs on handwritten notes. 100,000 people die every year due to medication errors. Of course! As the number of meds a person is on increases, the more likely a fatal interaction, overdose, or incorrectly written prescription will occur.<p>What if we ""allowed"" the airline industry to run on paper? Are we willing to tolerate 400 Air France crashes per year? Why does the medical industry get away with this?<p>I’d like to start a movement.

676682,comment,676593,676676,0,0,TriinT,,,"I would dare to say that there's much, much more than ideology here. There's an awful lot of <i>propaganda</i> on Global Warming. The facts that are presented are, in a way, manipulated to scare the masses. For me it's more than ideology, it's a matter of principle. I would like to see good, honest and open scientific debate on this topic, and that seems to be impossible. Anyone who questions the validity of the global warming predictions is labeled as a crackpot. This is very dangerous. This kind of dogmatic view is rather similar to the Inquisition.<p>If everybody had studied the global climate in detail and had arrived at the same conclusions, then the fact that everybody thinks the same way would not be dangerous. After all, everybody thinks the Earth is approximately ellipsoidal, and everybody can measure it. However, very few people have studied the climate in detail, and due to this herd movement, any scientist who questions the predictions the most pessimistic arrive to is attacked. This is unacceptable.",1246085206

Imagine: Thirtytwo Jefferson and his brother Thirtyfive Jefferson pledge to carry on the legacy of Kim Jong Il.  Forty Jefferson, who has become the Communist Party leader in Manchuria, warns them to tone down their rhetoric about the United States, at the same time as publishing an influential book about how democracy is a fundamentally deficient form of government.  Twentytwo Jefferson writes a series of increasingly unhinged tracts about the benefits of LSD, while Twentythree devotes his research career to unearthing relics of the Etruscans in Northern Italy.  Eighteen Jefferson moves to San Francisco and becomes notorious for his sexual escapades, one of which involves a group of Costa Rican nuns.",1246084266

Climatologists will generally agree that 30 years is the minimum time to consider when talking about global climate change, because of the natural rhythms and fluctuations year to year.<p>Saying that the last 8 years disproves climate change is like saying that last week was warmer than the week before and therefore we're heading into summer and not into winter.<p>However, there's probably not too much harm being done in waiting another 10 years before we take this more seriously. 10 years from now if we're having record heatwaves again everywhere, I expect most skeptics will start coming around.",1246084233

676667,comment,676593,676642,0,0,TriinT,,,"For starters, I don't like your tone. This is HN, not reddit. <i>Got it?</i><p>I stand by my assertion. ""Climate Change"" is a redundancy. The climate has <i>always</i> been changing. If you reduce the entire complexity of the global climate system to 1 bit, you're not doing any good Science. It's not whether it's changing or not, it's how it is changing. This makes a world of difference.<p>The laws of Physics haven't changed. What may change is the inputs: solar radiation, C02 and methane emissions from the biosphere, C02 emissions by humans, etc. Since we don't really know the inputs with good precision, and since we can't measure them reliably either, jumping to conclusions based on computer models is ludicrous.<p>The problem with computer models is that we lack sufficient knowledge on the initial conditions. We would need a whole lot more measurements to be able to come up with reliable computer simulations. Unfortunately, measuring is expensive, while simulating is cheap. Trying to solve the fluid and heat dynamics PDEs on a global scale with incomplete info on initial conditions is not Science, it's voodoo magic.<p>I repeat: the rules of the game haven't changed. The laws of Physics are still the same. Focus on measuring the inputs that drive the dynamical system, rather than make apocalyptical predictions based on bad computer models.",1246084049

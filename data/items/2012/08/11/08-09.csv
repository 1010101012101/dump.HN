These are my observations on OS X:<p><pre><code>  log into OS X user account      (nothing)\n  new terminal                    .profile\n  run ""bash"" from that terminal   .bashrc\n  run a shell script              (nothing)\n  ssh hostname                    .profile\n  ssh hostname somecommand        .bashrc\n</code></pre>\nThe behaviour of ssh seems (to me, at least) to contradict the bash man page. Anyway this was all so complicated that I'll never remember it, so what I ended up doing was:<p>* .profile does nothing other than source .bashrc<p>* In .bashrc anything that should be specific to interactive shells goes inside:<p><pre><code>  if [ -n ""${-//[^i]}"" ]; then\n    ...\n  fi</code></pre>",1344674932

4369732,comment,4369485,4369578,12,0,jwecker,,,"So I admit it's a 10 minute hack done on my way home on the train, but the issue is real even if you understand the man page. Here's roughly the way these work normally.<p>Starting with ""login"" bash invocation- which means:<p>* On linux, usually only when you first ssh into a machine or boot up into a terminal- and then _never again_ as you open various terminals or su etc. If you boot into gdm or something like most desktops/laptops do nowdays, you may hardly ever see your local machine invoke bash as a login shell.<p>* On a mac, ""login"" mode is invoked on pretty much every terminal you open.<p>* The login mode of a shell is _orthogonal_ to the shell being interactive (in theory. In practice, and in the gist, a login-shell is almost always a small subset of interactive shell invocations [or larger subset on mac]).<p>The rules for the login shell invocation are to load:<p>('/etc/profile' THEN (~/.bash_profile OR ~/.bash_login OR ~/.profile - one and only one, the first one it finds)) (and nothing else)<p>UNLESS bash is invoked as a login shell with the 'sh' name, in which case it does:<p>('/etc/profile' THEN ~/.profile)<p>IF the shell is NOT a login shell but IS interactive, don't load any of the profile stuff but load ~/.bashrc (ignored if bash is invoked as 'sh')<p>Finally, a shell in posix mode and a shell invoked by a script- i.e., non-interactive, will first load any file specified in the BASH_ENV environment variable and nothing else.<p>On a mac, the default for new home directories is to have a ~/.profile sitting there. Should you unwittingly drop a ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login in there one day, you would find (and many have found) that the ~/.profile suddenly stops working (more likely you suddenly notice your PATH isn't set anymore). Except sometimes, when bash is being invoked as sh, in which case ~/.profile is alive again.<p>And, note that .bashrc isn't loaded at all for a login invocation, even if it is interactive (true the vast majority of the time). On a mac, .bashrc seems useless, then on linux, .bash_profile seems useless. So many on linux end up filling up their .bashrc with the good stuff and then realize that when they log in remotely nothing gets loaded so they troubleshoot, read the manpage, and end up sourcing .bash_profile from their .bashrc. On mac, people tend to do the reverse. Oh, and when you are trying to remember what is what and why you should care-- the manpage is almost 5,000 lines long. AFAIK, it's the only manpage the size of a book.<p>Anyway, I was putting my dotfiles into github and spend a lot of time on OSX and Linux so was merging the two sets. I also have seen (and written) so many rc scripts that liberally mix stuff that is relevant for interactive-mode with stuff that should really only be done at login, etc. That said, it _is_ a 10 minute hack so forks + fixes appreciated.",1344673950
4369731,comment,4368993,4369692,4,0,alexlarsson,,,"I don't expect every user to create unix pipes 2.0, so the difficulty of that is not really what needs to be compared. It will only have to be done once.<p>And once this is done any user can avoid having to painstakingly construct pipelines that try to cut out the right columns to treat as numbers, or avoid all the problems parsing strings that may contain spaces or other control characters. You can do an operation like:<p>filter out all processes with %cpu > 20 with uid > 1000 and sort by second cmdline arg as:<p>dps | dfilter pcpu "">"" 20 uid "">"" 1000 | dsort ""cmdvect[1]""<p>Obviously a made up example, but something like this is easy to read and write, whereas something working on tabular ascii data would be quite long and complicated.<p>As per black magic, I have about the same interpretation as you. I didn't really misunderstand it to be about how complicated it was. However, ""black magic"" certainly has a feel of ""you should not do this"", and arguing that you can then use that in order to do something which could instead be simple and obvious in a typed system seems kind of weird.",1344673895

The only thing that was implicit was the automatic transformation of string -> unicode when people mistakenly used unicode codecs on string objects, or the reverse for string codecs on unicode objects. The proper answer to both of these is to just not do automatic type conversion... which is what was done in Python 3.<p>So actually, had we left all of the codec machinery intact, those codec errors described by Armin wouldn't ever occur again!

I would like to get feedback on an idea I had to gauge its viability:<p>The Problem:\nAs a frequent traveler (on a budget) to different countries I always find myself having to buy new sim cards in each country I visit to get network and data access while I'm in that country.<p>This involves keeping tracking of all my different sim cards for each country and taking them with me everywhere I go. Using the roaming features is just not viable due to the insane charges that are incurred. There are currently providers that offer a ""one-sim"" service but these services still dictate the prices that you have to use and have somewhat limited offerings / selections when it comes to packages.<p>The Solution:\nWhy not create a service (website / app)that allows you to use one generic sim card all the time, but manage the networks you belong to via a website / app?\nFor example, when currently visiting a new country, you would have to go into a shop / contact call center and get a new sim card to use any of a network provider's services.<p>Instead, now you would just log into your ""One-Sim"" account, select the network and package you want to join from a list of networks available in that country. The service would then register you on that network and then add that network to your global list of available networks. You then just switch to that network via the website / app and voila you are on the new network using one of their packages / contracts.\nWhen you return to another country, you simply go back to the app, select the network for that country and then the app connects you to that network.<p>Advantages / Disadvantages to follow...",1344673442

Each variant is a self contained typed data chunk which is by itself not ""streamable"" (i.e. you have to read all of it). The data chunk is strongly typed and the type is self-described.<p>The supported primitive types are: bool, byte, int16, uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64, double, utf8 string (+ some dbus specific things).<p>These can be recursively combined with:\narrays (of same type), tuples, dicts (primitive type -> any type map), maybe type, and variant type<p>In my dps example I generate a stream of dictionaries mapping from string to variant (i.e. any type). The type of each item in the map differs. For instance cmdvec is an array of strings, whereas euid is an uint32.",1344672067

Chomsky stuff.

448154,comment,445707,448009,0,0,jballanc,,,"So, I think you're focusing too much on the specific example and not enough on the runtime distinction. The C runtime looks for ""main()"". If you trick it into looking in different places for it, that's a trick. Ruby (and other scripting languages) goes through the source file sequentially, executing statements and definitions as it goes. There isn't a specific symbol for it to look for. (Well, there is, but that just complicates matters.) The point I'm trying to make is that the distinction between scripting language and programming language shouldn't rely on how it's used, but rather on how it's formatted.<p>...and by the way, I <i>would</i> consider x86 assembly a scripting language. You're just scripting out the processor's actions...",1232810300

I didn't get all the terms I asked for but I did get enough to make it worth while to sign.<p>An additional requirement might be that you actually have to be an inventor with a proven track record.  If your proven record and skill set is indistinguishable from millions other workers, you are hosed no matter what.  You have to take what you can get.  In that case, it doesn't matter because you have no IP to protect anyway.<p>Most IP agreements are written by lawyers who arrange the terms to be totally one sided.  Your employer is to have absolute claim over the entire contents of your life.  THAT is simply unacceptable.  Yes, you need a job but the employer needs someone who can do the work as well.  You don't have to agree to be a rightless drone.  A job like that is not worth having.<p>You have the right to pursue your skill to make a living.  An employer does not have the right to prohibit that.  Ask for terms that respect BOTH your and your employer's rights and you are likely to have them accepted.",1232810232

448151,comment,445707,446136,0,0,acangiano,,,"That's a good point, but I'll address both points.<p>- What are my friends using?<p>Each of these languages has online communities that are ready to help. Some more than others, but they all minimize the need to have real life friends who use the given language. Physical groups can be beneficial, but thanks to the internet they are no longer strictly necessary. Also, in most cities there are usergroups if you'd like to interact in person with the community.<p>- What are the people in my field using?<p>There are advantages associated with using a language or DSL/framework that's popular within your field - there is no denying that. But you shouldn't underestimate the competitive advantage that a more obscure language that's better suited for the task can give you over your competitors. PG used Common Lisp without a relational database for Viaweb. Yet in part that was the secret to his success. I suspect that using Lisp or Haskell in places where everyone else still use C++ or Java, may be a major competitive advantage thanks to the increased productivity and more robust code you can write with them.",1232810034

He talks about 'increasing light'.<p>My point is that for a 'spiritual person', true success is aimed for in the long-term measure - the one by which we are ultimately judged - whether deemed to be judged by ourselves or a third party. So to ask, in the context of 'spiritual business' about success, meaning financial success, is something of a contradiction in terms.",1232809778

448144,comment,446881,447983,0,0,jerf,,,"""you seem to be lumping a whole load of very diverse opinions together then criticising them as a whole"" - well, <i>duh</i>. No HN post can possibly tease apart all the possibilities. That's really a null criticism unless you want everyone to be typing books back and forth at each other.<p>You seem to work off the assumption that engineers won't be interested in testing the solutions before implementing them on the large scale. I think you may have them confused with scientists on that point. Engineers are well aware of the issues of complexity and inability to predict... hell, half the reason I have a hard time buying what climate scientists are selling is precisely because I am an engineer, I do have that understanding, and I am completely unconvinced that they do!<p>Any real engineer would be <i>religious</i> about testing. Each plan would be phased in, with observations taken after each phase to make sure we're going in the right direction, and if at all possible, plans on how to undo what we just did if it becomes obvious it's really not working. (That may not be possible, but any plan for which it <i>is</i> possible would be that much more preferred.)<p>I'm serious about this: The biggest bioengineering risk would ultimately not be about the bioengineering at all. It would be that a politician (probably egged on by scientists) would overrule the good judgment of engineers. How many times have we read that story in a programming context? It's not unique to programming engineers, we just lack the authority to tell our bosses to go to hell, we're not doing it that unsafely. (The one good thing we'd get from a programmer certification process. I'm broadly against it, but it does have its good points.) Politicians could and probably would blow right past that.<p>By the way: I don't hate scientists (a stupid position for an engineer). The opinions expressed in this post are based on observations of climate scientists ""in the wild"". Scientists in general are far more humble before the face of a complicated universe, as well they should be, as is ultimately the entire point of the scientific process.",1232809292

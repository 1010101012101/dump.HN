Say that about a thousand times. Once you are creating value, then you can write long blog posts about various tool choices -- or spend time reading them. Until then? These issues are so trivial as to almost not be worthy of discussion.<p>The interesting thing is that this is exactly backwards from the way most folks are taught programming. You pick the tool first, learn it&#x27;s secrets, then set about making someone happy. This is a great paradigm if you want to be a corporate programmer, but if you&#x27;re looking to form a startup you&#x27;ve got the cart in front of the horse. Sure, bring the skills to use all kinds of tech. But don&#x27;t spend a millisecond focusing on that crap when nobody wants what you&#x27;re offering.<p>A lot of guys who say they&#x27;re in startups are like a severely overweight and out of shape guy who sits around reading running magazines and ordering expensive gear.

That&#x27;s true, but I don&#x27;t think it matters for what I was trying to test -- I was <i>not</i> trying to test how well a given rdbms can handle load, for instance; I was trying to standardize that, to test the app&#x27;s performance. My simulation assumes an (eg) 50ms _average_ iowait time, by just assigning every request 50ms of wait. Or instead of 50ms, whatever average iowait you wanted to posit and test, and I tested a few. It is indeed a simulation, but I think it captures the significant things for what we wanted to measure).<p>However! I would very much welcome seeing the results from a test done by you (or anyone else), with an application that simulates (or actually does) I/O in a way that you believe is more realistic and leads to more instructive results. It certainly would be interesting to see if it led to different results than my tests, or not. I suspect it would not (because I think my app is realistically simulating the parts that matter, naturally! but I&#x27;ve been wrong before!)<p>Feel free to fork my code to do so, if my code is a useful starting point for you. Please do share your results!<p>Of course, you could also run tests with some actual real world app as well, instead of an app simulating a real world load in a standardized way like I used, and see what those results look like.  I&#x27;d certainly welcome seeing that too! There&#x27;s certainly plenty of different sorts of tests that could be done.

As a result, many web sites are frustratingly slow in my opinion (for example, a popular site used for hosting source code repositories).

Horizontal scaling may help alleviate an over-taxed CPU dealing with too many concurrent requests, but if a single request in isolation runs in 300ms, it will not run quicker than 300ms.  It may run <i>worse</i> when contending for CPU capacity versus concurrent requests, but not better, unless a faster CPU is dropped in.<p>Performance matters, even in the world of horizontal scalability.  Performance brings reduced latency (user experience) and reduced cost (size of cluster).

If an attacker were using an irreversible but thermodynamically ideal computer floating in space passively cooled to the temperature of cosmic background radiation... the amount of waste heat from her computer would be enough to boil away Earth&#x27;s oceans.  I&#x27;m too lazy to look up Bruce Schneier&#x27;s calculation for counting to 2 * * 256, but counting to 2 * * 327 may very well require more energy than our Sun will output between now and when it goes cold.<p>Now, all of the basic qbit operations are reversible, so the above theoretical lower bound on waste heat doesn&#x27;t apply to a quantum computer.  However, if the hash algorithm doesn&#x27;t have any weaknesses and has at least 326 bits of state in an optimal implementation, it will still take an attacker 2 * * 163 hash operations on a quantum computer, so at least 2 * * 163 times the clock cycle of the quantum computer.<p>Or... even given some rather weak assumptions about SHA-1, if your bank and FunnyCatPitcures.com both use salted SHA-1, and the stolen password hash is 160 bits, but the password itself is 327 bits, an ideal attacker is going to find your password along with about 2 * * 167 false correct answers.  As long as your bank uses a different salt for your account than FunnyCatPictures.com did, then having your password hash from FunnyCatPictures.com doesn&#x27;t help an attacker.<p>Basically, as long as your password has at least twice as many bits of entropy as the stolen salted hash, the number of false positives (hash collisions) from cracking the hash is more than the expected number of random guesses needed to get a false positive (hash collision) at your bank, so the attacker is better off just throwing random guesses at the bank.",1377628310

I know many people find static guarantees and unacceptable curtailment of their &quot;programming freedom&quot;, but frankly I think it&#x27;s the answer to many of the problems we face in software today. Small is another thing. E.g. Go and Scheme are <i>small</i>. C++ and Scala are <i>large</i>.

Side effect isolation (i.e. language-enforced purity) would be another feature I&#x27;d like to see become common. For example, the D programming language has a &quot;<i>pure</i>&quot; keyword that lets you mark a function as side-effect free. (In Haskell, all function are pure by default, and you escape the confines of purity via monads.)<p>I&#x27;d like to do research into (inventing) other forms of static assertions. One thing that&#x27;s been on my mind lately, has been static &quot;complexity assertion&quot; for programs. I don&#x27;t know if this even possible, but it would be nice to be able to ascertain before running a program, certain time & space complexity bounds on it. This would perhaps require us to drop the programming language itself to some level &quot;slightly below&quot; Turing machines -- but this in itself could be achieved via a keyword like D&#x27;s &quot;pure&quot; or something more elegant. (Note: my point is not that we&#x27;re going to make the <i>entire</i> language <i>non</i>-Turing complete -- but rather that we&#x27;ll have subsets of the language that are <i>not</i>, and this reduction of power would/could bring with it a greater possibility for statically asserting stuff.)<p>[1] FYI I made this term up.

6285159,comment,6282943,6284306,1,0,mcherm,,,"> Maybe it&#x27;s a complete coincidence.<p>The word &quot;correlated&quot; means that it is NOT just a complete coincidence. One might not cause the other, they might be correlated because of a separate factor that interacts with both, but if they are &quot;correlated&quot; then complete coincidence can be ruled out.<p>> [...] So the lead is correlated to crime historically, even though neither causes the other directly.<p>Yes, this is what I mean by a third factor affecting both. But lead is a physical effect -- there are only certain sorts of things that can cause it. Things like eating lead, breathing lead, or having a diet that causes one to incorporate less lead into neurons. Thinking happy thoughts cannot change your lead levels (directly). So there are only certain categories of separate factors, C, that could be the cause of both A (lead) and B (crime). Where your name comes in the alphabet might conceivably cause crime, but it simply cannot cause lead. C, if it exists, must be a physical effect.<p>That&#x27;s why I mentioned controlling for location where people live. That is a likely candidate for C: it is plausible to correlate with crime and it is possible to correlate with lead. If you control for it and still find an effect, then either A causes B, B causes A (not reasonable), or there is a different C&#x27;. Perhaps a genetic mutation that increases lead absorption and also alters brain chemistry to increase propensity to crime? That one is already a bit of a stretch.<p>I guess what I am saying is that it is true that correlation does not imply causation, but that there are reasonableness constraints on the kinds of interactions one can hypothesize, and after a certain point Occam&#x27;s razor implores us to consider causation.",1377627483

I know what you are talking about there too, but that&#x27;s not how I see the strategy working.<p>What I found in my research is that the statistical analysis being done on markets is an approximation of the underlying phenomena. Yes - central tendencies and dispersion work 90% of the time, but they hugely under price tail events. This is the basis of Nassim Taleb&#x27;s trading strategy.<p>What I see really happening is a recursive channel pattern at different time scales. As the recursion plays out it &quot;zooms in&quot; on the correct price of a security and the central tendencies and dispersion can be analyzed through traditional statistics. However, when a market correction takes place it &quot;zooms out&quot; by stepping back through previous market cycles and then statistical models break down. It&#x27;s very weird to explain. Essentially, I see the market being a predictable Fractal pattern. Check out Mandelbrot&#x27;s work on Finance to get some insight. I just disagree with his (and Nassim&#x27;s) conclusion that these can&#x27;t be predicted.<p>I&#x27;ve always been interested in trying to back test my theory but I didn&#x27;t have the technical chops and didn&#x27;t know where to start looking.<p>Thanks for your thoughts.",1377627474

Go touts it as one of its major pros; and I do agree for personal experience that compile time matters.<p>You can often cut down compile-time by making &quot;run-time compromises&quot;. For instance, with C++ code, dyn-linking rather statically linking everything can speed up things significantly. This is because with massive C++ codebases, when you change a couple of lines, rebuilding the relevant objects only takes a few seconds - but the static linking stage can take forever.<p>On memory constrained system (4GB) of RAM, I&#x27;ve seen a particular codebase that I&#x27;ve worked with take up to 28 minutes <i>just to</i> link. The same code on a machine with 8 gigs of RAM (just double) took less than 4 minutes to link. Due to the sheer number of objects that need to be linked, your system ends up thrashing (swapping pages out to disk).<p>That being said, I read somewhere that Go doesn&#x27;t support incremental compilation. I don&#x27;t if this is still true, but that&#x27;s a major problem that needs to be fixed right away.<p>With interpreted languages, practically everything is done at run-time and you have no compilation stage -- but at a massive performance penalty. Tracing JITs do help though.",1377627077

6285092,comment,6283309,6283309,10,0,jfarmer,,,"Hmm, I think this is a fine essay for people who have already internalized the notion of algebra <i>per se</i>, but it&#x27;s not great for a student who has to yet to do so and is asking the titular question &quot;What is algebra?&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s my attempt for, say, a relatively smart high school student.  Consider this a rough draft; I&#x27;m writing it from start to finish without editing.  I&#x27;d love, love, love feedback, though.<p>Today even schoolchildren understand arithmetic.  We have these things called &quot;numbers.&quot;  There are different types of numbers like natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, and irrational numbers.  We have rules for manipulating these numbers like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<p>This wasn&#x27;t always the case, however.  I don&#x27;t mean that humans couldn&#x27;t always add, but I do mean that it took humans thousands of years and multiple false starts to come up with a sensible way to represent numbers and these operations.  Think about trying to do division with Roman numerals, for example.  It&#x27;d be a nightmare!<p>There was a time when numbers like &quot;4/5&quot;, &quot;-2&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, and &quot;5&quot; made people freak out because we didn&#x27;t have the symbols to represent them and it wasn&#x27;t obvious what they corresponded to &quot;in real life,&quot; if anything.  Imagine yourself living in a world like the ancient Greeks, for example, where you represented numbers by talking about lines of a given length. It was very hard for you to talk about numbers <i>per se</i> without drawing a shape that somehow encoded that number.  Now, pop quiz: how do you represent something like &quot;0&quot; or &quot;-2&quot; in this world?  If you were a Roman using Roman numerals, how would you represent &quot;4/5&quot;?<p>This is just a story to highlight that although we take our numbering system and arithmetic for granted, this was not the case for most of human history, even most of recorded human history.  The way we do arithmetic was an <i>invention</i> that both helped us do arithmetic and helped us understand WTF a number even is.<p>By the way, if you freak out at the idea of imaginary numbers or the idea of a number i which satisfies the property i^2 = -1, this is <i>no different</i> than the kind of freaking out the ancient Greeks did when they first encountered 2 or other cultures tried to make sense of negative numbers.<p>Now, let&#x27;s think about what we really did by inventing arithmetic as we understand it today.  You can&#x27;t point to the number &quot;5&quot; anywhere in the world, right?  Even the symbol 5 isn&#x27;t five <i>per se</i>, any more than &quot;five&quot;, &quot;fnf&quot;, &quot;|||||&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, or &quot;&quot; are five <i>per se</i>.  But with one symbol &quot;5&quot; we can represent this abstract thing.<p>Then something like &quot;5 + 4&quot; might represent the length of a line segment made from concatenating a line segment of length 5 and a line segment of length 4, the age of a 5-year-old in 4 years, the volume of water made from pouring five buckets of water into a pool and then four buckets of water, the number of apples shared between a 5-apple basket and a 4-apple basket, and so on.  So, these abstract things we call &quot;numbers&quot; and &quot;arithmetical operations&quot; can represent many more concrete things.<p>Let&#x27;s call this process &quot;abstracting.&quot;  Algebra is what you get when you treat numbers as the concrete thing and apply this same process.  With arithmetic, we want to talk about numbers divorced from a particular concrete realization.  That is, we want to talk about the number 5 without having to talk about a basket of five apples.  With algebra, we want to talk about numbers <i>per se</i> divorced from a particular concrete number.<p>Remember, when we invented arithmetic we had to invent a bunch of symbols to represent the abstract thing.  We do that in algebra, too.  Often we use single-letter symbols like x and y, but we could use anything like , , or zorpzop.  These symbols &quot;stand in&quot; some number in the same way that the symbol 5 &quot;stands in&quot; for all the things 5 could possibly represent in the world.  We can talk about 5 without talking about the things it might represent.<p>So, we say things like &quot;let x be a number&quot; or &quot;let x be a positive number&quot; or &quot;let x be a rational number.&quot;  What can we say about x in each of these situations?<p>For example, if x, y, and z are all standing in for some number, we can say the following:<p><pre><code>    x + 0 = 0 + x = x          regardless of what number x is\n    x + y = y + x              regardless of what numbers x and y are\n    x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z  regardless of what numbers x, y, and z are\n    x*1 = 1*x = x              regardless of what number x is\n    x*(y + x) = x*y + x*z      regardless of what numbers x, y, and z are\n</code></pre>\nThese are true because of what we mean when we say &quot;number&quot; and what we mean when we say &quot;addition.&quot;  It&#x27;s not as if these are true for some numbers and not all, nor is it as if we know these are true because we&#x27;ve &quot;checked all the numbers.&quot;  That&#x27;s impossible because there are an infinitude of numbers.<p>So, now we might ask things like, &quot;Are there any numbers x such that x^2 + 1 = 0?  How about x^2 + x - 1 = 0?&quot;  These questions might be hard to answer, but we have now at least invented a language where we can ask them, whereas before &quot;abstracting&quot; arithmetic into algebra we had no easy and succinct way of asking them.<p>This is no different than not being able to easily ask, &quot;Can we construct an equilateral triangle with side lengths of ?&quot; before abstracting from more concrete things into numbers.  Without a symbol for  we have to say things like &quot;the constant that is the ratio formed between the circumference and diameter of a circle.&quot;  This is how mathematics was done for thousands of years.  It was tough going, as you can imagine, and we missed many things that would seem &quot;obvious&quot; to people using our notation.<p>You can continue this process further, by the way, and abstract further from algebra.  This is what mathematicians call <i>abstract algebra</i> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra</a>).  In this context there are multiple algebras and the &quot;algebra of numbers&quot; becomes the concrete thing in this new system.  Linear algebra is a different algebra, for example, with a different sets of &quot;numbers&quot; and a different set of &quot;arithmetical operations&quot; that don&#x27;t always correspond 1-to-1 with the numbers and operations we find in arithmetic.<p>Often, when presented with a new physical system of objects that interact in a certain way, we can try to abstract these objects and operations into symbols and derive rules about these abstract symbols and operations that correspond to the workings of the physical system.<p>We might call this symbolic system &quot;an algebra.&quot;  For example, Claude Shannon invented an algebra for relay and switching circuits that allows us to understand how they operated and how to combine them without actually building physical circuits.

8844536,comment,8844023,8844023,0,0,lmm,,,"&quot;imperative&quot; does not seem like a good/valuable characterization. Yes, the &quot;do&quot; form is imperative. That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re not supposed to use it much, perhaps only for the top-level structure of your program, the part that acts as an interpreter to connect the pure program to the outside world. <i>When you express business logic in a language like clojure</i>, that expression of the business logic is not usually &quot;a sequence of commands executed in order&quot;. It usually looks more like &quot;an expression tree and rules for how nodes are evaluated&quot;.<p>The downside of a simple, transparent language like lisp is that it exposes you to the dangerous parts of the underlying. An opaque abstraction (e.g. expressing database operations as a tree of operations some of which define transaction boundaries, rather than as a series of SQL commands some of which open or close transactions) is vital for transforming dangerous things into safe things. Ultimately a program looks like an expression of business-level logic and then an opaque layer that pretends the computer is actually a machine that understands your business. Lisp forces you to provide more of that opacity yourself, whereas a language that already has a vocabulary for drawing distinctions between different kinds of thing provides you some of the scaffolding you need (the tradeoff being of course that it will be less specialized to your particular circumstances).",1420555762

8844430,comment,8842564,8844200,0,0,vidarh,,,"The point again is that regardless whether or not the likelihood a mature superintelligence doing so is infinitesimally small (and frankly, we can&#x27;t know that, but see also below) is irrelevant. What actually affects us is how many people may come to believe that this may be true, and adjust the way they act as a response.<p>But you&#x27;re already changing the argument when assuming a mature super-intelligence. All that is necessary to posit for someone to be concerned about the torture aspect is <i>any</i> set of entities (doesn&#x27;t even need to be intelligent, though it may take a super-intelligence to create the entities in question) sufficiently capable to run an ancestor simulation of the kind described by the simulation argument, that is willing to use torture, and that is prepared to run enough ancestor simulations to offset &quot;good&quot; simulations.<p>And the thing with this is that it does not assume a malicious AI even as the ultimate instigator per se. Assuming an <i>indifferent</i> AI that simply doesn&#x27;t care about the contents of a simulation or is sufficiently removed to not even know about them. One that does simulation runs to understand the possible paths the development of AI <i>could have taken</i> might be sufficient. Or that experiments with variations of itself and simply doesn&#x27;t care that some broken version spawns large numbers of ancestor simulations and plays with the contents in ways that massively skews the odds in &quot;favour&quot; of bad outcomes.<p>But the point is we don&#x27;t know. And not knowing gives ample room for someone to decide on values that makes it rational for them to act in ways that may make our odds worse.<p>This is further an exercise in long term statistics: It doesn&#x27;t matter what the likely first AI will do. It matters what the balance of outcomes of the sum total simulation runs that will ever exist until the end of the universe will be (regardless of who or how they are created). And if said simulations are sufficiently powerful, that may even apply recursively (imagine a single &quot;rogue&quot; AI playing with the ancestor simulation equivalent of a fork() bomb with added torture, with access to sufficient resources).<p>If you believe the total balance of simulation runs that you could plausibly be in will be ones run by some set of parameters where nasty things will happen if you don&#x27;t act in a way leading towards an AI takeover, then one might want to act accordingly.<p>Note that Roko&#x27;s Basilisk even posits a <i>Friendly</i> AI.  That is, one that is imbued with respect for human values, but that may simply consider &quot;threatening the past&quot; with torture a necessity in order to ensure it is created as a moral imperative to minimize human suffering. Note that such a Friendly AI would have reason to carry out this threat even if it believes it exists and so has been created, because it will not know whether <i>it</i> is a &quot;full version&quot; running in reality, or a partial, restricted, time limited simulation by people trying to figure out whether or not Roko&#x27;s Basilisk holds before deciding whether to let it loose in their reality.<p>To an AI that is looking to minimize human suffering, torturing a suitable number in simulations might be a small price to pay to ensure that if <i>it</i> is in a simulation, the people running the simulation does push through with creating the full thing in their reality (which might of course be yet another layer of simulation) out of fear for what will happen if they are themselves in a simulation.<p>We can&#x27;t even look at &quot;well, I&#x27;ve done nothing for the AI revolution, and I&#x27;ve not been struck down yet&quot;, because a Friendly AI, or indeed many subsets of possible variations over this argument, might be minimising the torture to only people who have a realistic shot at making a difference to the existence of such AI, or may be giving us every chance to &quot;redeem ourselves&quot; by waiting with the torture until a synthetic afterlife.<p>Roko&#x27;s Basilisk also presents an unselfish reason for &quot;cooperating in advance&quot; with such an AI: To prevent the future torture of a suitable subset of &quot;martyrs&quot;. That is, working to assist a Friendly AI in taking over may itself be a moral imperative for someone seeking to minimize suffering.<p>Then again, there may very well be one or more fundamental flaws in the entire argument, or it may turn out the odds are just fundamentally in our favour. Or we could&#x27;ve just gotten lucky. Or not be important enough. But it&#x27;s fun to think about.",1420554344

Because each rendered page&#x27;s content was built up in a hierarchical manner, I added a caching layer that allowed arbitrary portions of the rendered page &quot;tree&quot; to be cached all the way up to the entire page and HTTP response if possible. Each cached portion could be located quickly based on its dependencies (template ID, content ID, CSS etc). If any edits were made to the site, only the relevant portions needed to be flushed and re-rendered. User-specific portions could be cached in the user&#x27;s session rather than site-wide. (Thinking about it now, each portion could have been rendered in parallel too, though this was back in the days when multicore machines weren&#x27;t very common and it wasn&#x27;t something that occurred to me.)<p>I built this without giving much thought to whether anyone else had attempted something similar.

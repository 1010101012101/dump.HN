I share most of the views from the post above you, but I'd like to expand on them a bit.<p>First of all, I don't think people <i>like</i> flaws. If you take someone who has never listened to a vinyl record and ask them to listen to one and compare it with a CD recording, I'd bet they would cite the CD as being the better experience.<p>What people like is what they are comfortable with, and not just because of habit: distinctive patterns, especially in highly emotionally charged areas such as movies and music, generate emotional connections and attachment. Those who grew up listening to vinyl associate it's ""fuzzy/scratchy"" sound with the moments they spent listening to them. There's very potent emotional attachment to those flaws, and that's why people are attracted to them. When I hear the warbly sound and see the poor quality visuals of old VHS's, I'm taken back to watching Disney movies as a child.<p>As explained in this article[0], these emotional attachments are the reason why people enjoy Instagram to the degree that they do. The washed out, blurry, grainy photos generated by Instagram hit on the emotional connections to old photographs of our parents and of our childhoods.<p>Similarly, I think the same follows for 24 fps vs 48 fps movies; think of all the intense moments you've had while watching a movie in your lifetime. How many times have you laughed or cried or gasped at something happening in a movie shot in 24 fps? Given that any movie you've watched up till now has been shot at 24 fps, you've probably done it many times. Each time you feel those strong emotions, every aspect of that moment is associated with that feeling: the smell of the popcorn, the low lighting, the chair you where sitting in, the people with you. All of those details are now associated with that memory and that experience.<p>Now repeat that process of strong emotional association for every single movie or TV show you've ever seen. With this information, it's obvious why people are so attached to this small aspect of a movie: because there are strong emotions associated with the 24 fps frame rate.<p>[0] <a href=""http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2011/05/14/the-faux-vintage-photo-full-essay-parts-i-ii-and-iii/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2011/05/14/the-faux-v...</a>",1357793993

You could even imagine the device being video-based, something you run on your laptop (which obviously doesn't actually upload or even record pictures of you). If you can stand topless in front of a fitter, you can stand topless in front of a device.<p>A less intense approach, though, would be doing a better job of statistical modeling women's breast shapes and how well different kinds of bras fit them. If you sell bras for a while and different women return different ones, you can start to build a sense of what customers' ideal fits are and refine what bra shapes and styles get sent to them. Whether that data can be accumulated fast enough to make the service useful is an open question, but it at least doesn't sound crazy.",1357793943

And yet, there are federal and school policies in place to prevent students from paying less than their fair share. I know students whose families earn about 25-30k/yr, who have siblings, and are still expected to pay ~15k/yr. My family's Expected Family Contribution last year was something like 20k (which is more than they were able to pay, so I still had to go into debt). However, due to the fact that I earned about 10k at an internship the previous summer, despite my parent's income remaining constant, our EFC increased to 28k. And, due to my unusually high income, I was eligible for about 4k less in subsidized federal loans (which I've had to max out). Meaning I've had to rely on private loans to make up the difference this year.

Once an exploit module makes it into the Metasploit Framework, it's immediately available to ~250K users. The Metasploit Framework isn't just exploits though, it's an integration point for offensive capabilities that simply work together. It's also very easy to hook your own stuff into it.<p>There are several programs that build on the Metasploit Framework and take advantage of it. Rapid7 has commercial penetration testing products. I build the open source Armitage GUI for it and a commercial add-on called Cobalt Strike.<p>It's worth spending some time to learn how it works and what it does.

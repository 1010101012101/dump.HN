That, in turn, is to prevent scam artists from inducing people to part with their money by ""investing"" in a private investment that's totally free of SEC registration and oversight.  If you wanted to invest in your friend's startup, you could, but if you wanted to fund other third-party startups with which you had no pre-existing relationship, you'd need to register as an accredited investor.<p>See grellas's excellent summary from a few days ago:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1221387"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1221387</a><p>As absurd as it seems, laws like this don't come out of nowhere just to make people's lives complicated and miserable:  the SEC registration requirements are there to prevent scam artists (of which the 20th century that saw rise to these laws saw plenty), and the accredited investor regulations are a way to clarify the exemptions to those requirements.",1269968243

I haven't posted it to the Redis list yet because it's still a bit young* , but the big feature is that it supports non-blocking operation via an arbitrary defer hook and async socket IO, for easy non-blocking / event-driven operation. (I have a project quite similar to node.js in the works, and Redis and non-blocking socket IO fit great with Lua's coroutines.)<p>* Most notably, the code to auto-reconnect while pipelining needs work, and I just finished moving, so it probably won't get touched for a week or two.<p>It has a translation of the entire official test suite into Lua (which was an ... interesting ... way to learn Tcl :) ), plus some other extensions for idiomatic handling of sets, lists, and zsets in Lua. (They're translated to tables with {key=true} for sets, {key=score} for zsets, and {key1, key2, key3, ...} for lists.) Also, the other Lua Redis library feels a bit more Ruby-ish to me.<p>I never got into Tcl, but that or Lua seem like the clear frontrunners as embedded config/scripting languages go.

If, it turns out, that what makes you happy are big houses and expensive cars or planes (I have an uncle who truly seems happy with all 14 airplanes he owns.. though he's an ex-commercial pilot who usually finds old planes he refurbishes and doesn't mind if they crash land in corn fields..

It will take time, we are just entering 2.0 feature freeze, and later the priority will be redis-cluster, but we'll get scripting soon or later probably. Now I happen to be the original author of Jim, a small embeddable but fast enough (using an objects specialization technique) Tcl implementation. It's just a single .c file with 10k lines of C that is albe to run many Tcl programs unmodified if they don't tak with the ""outside world"" (that is no files, no sockets, no everything). It is really designed to be embedded, check it here:<p><a href=""http://repo.or.cz/w/jimtcl.git"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repo.or.cz/w/jimtcl.git</a><p>Jim Tcl is actively developed, and used in OpenOCD (<a href=""http://www.amontec.com/openocd/doc/About-JIM_002dTcl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amontec.com/openocd/doc/About-JIM_002dTcl.html</a>), in eCos environments and so forth.<p>But what I think is that users may get upset if I don't use a different language. The problem is, I don't know any single-c-file easy to embed, fast enough, interpreter for a language that will be more welcomed (I would like Javascript, for instance).<p>Also Tcl happens to be perfect to write Redis scripts, as they will look like commands issued with the redis-cli, like that:<p><pre><code>    register-command GETDEL key {\n        set result [GET $key]\n        DEL $key\n        bulk-reply $result\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI wonder what will happen, if I'll go ahead or if there will be an alternative. I can't see how Lua is more elegant or better than Tcl, and while not hard to embed definitely not as simple and self-contained as Jim Tcl is. Also Lua is far from being a well known language.<p>I really think that the right thing to do is to embed Jim Tcl, but there is a cultural barrier preventing me from doing this.<p>Btw, Lua is absolutely the best among all the JS / Ruby / Python / ... implementation I saw.<p>Without configure, and with a ""Make ansi"" target that is suitable to be used with the zero-configuration environment of Redis. So actually if it will not be Jim, it will probably be Lua.",1269966819

It's a juggling act though, to work hard so some of them become reality, and hope that other people will take on the rest of my dreams (because I also know I won't be able to do it all myself). Regarding American Dreams, as an immigrant to this country, strangely I have none. I have learned so much while living here, I think that is an undeserving gift to me. My american dream is that America can evolve and find new ways to prosper, innovate while never forgetting the real reasons their founders fought for.

It reminds me of a game design article I read a long time ago, which mentioned that the best way to figure out if you have a game that will be fun when it's finished is to ""start with the stupidest thing that could possibly work.""  In other words, starting small and focusing on the core mechanic, and building on that only once you've ""found the fun,"" is a reliable way to produce fun games.  This is in stark contrast to the way many projects are run (game or otherwise), in which thousands of features are planned out right from the start and presumably developed in parallel, like a hundred people simultaneously trying to stuff themselves through a single doorway.",1269964995

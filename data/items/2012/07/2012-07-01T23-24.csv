To give you a sneak preview: You can use the type system in such a way, that your source program will safely discriminate between the two types of strings (e.g. tainted and untainted), but there won't be anything left in the compiled assembly (tags or wrapping or whatever).<p>Also about the HTML: You can of course use different syntax for what I proposed, one that's closer to actual HTML.  But I think as long as the syntax tree is preserved, it's still close enough to HTML for me, and all your accumulated knowledge about HTML is still applicable.  (Not to be derisive, but if your years of learning are no longer of any use upon such a cosmetic change, you should probably examine your level of comprehension.)",1341186973

A politician that was not some denomination of Christianity would be, most likely, completely unable to win a Presidential election. And that's even if they were a religion the Christian majority feels close to, such as Jewish. If they were Muslim, or so help them atheist, they would stand no chance at the White House.<p>I recently had a friend of 6 years from the UK come and visit for two weeks, and we had a number of discussions on cultural differences. When he mentioned that the majority of people in the UK were not religious, I was dumbfounded. I (foolishly) thought it was everywhere as it is here. In my community at least, to openly question the existence of a God is a social faux pas. I have an interesting perspective having been on both sides of the coin, but in the end it scares me as much as it scares you.

Some combination of better education and healthcare is part of it, and I support negative population growth in the world in general and the US in specific.)<p>US foreign policy is a bit too interventionist for my taste, but I'd prefer it to pure pacifism.  A better-armed UK or France is probably a reasonable compromise for that.  However, most US foreign interventions (except Iraq) aren't that horrible for most citizens (and even Iraq wasn't that much worse than Iraq 1991-2003 or 1980-1988) of the foreign countries, certainly compared to invasions and occupations by other countries.",1341186729

Here are some comments from the other side of the pond; they're of course my personal opinion but I think they're somewhat representative of the European view.<p><i>I dont view the USA as the center of the world</i> - i see America as an overreaching empire that has had it's heyday. If you take a historical perspective this is how many empires fall. They overreach by trying to annex large parts of the world, spend all of their resources doing so and eventually implode. The British and Roman empire are good examples.<p><i>I stopped calling myself a Christian</i> - the fact that many Americans are so religious is just utterly strange, and somewhat frightening. If the Danish prime minister started confessing her belief in a god she'd be laughed out of the room.<p><i>Ioccasionallyfeltembarrassedof America</i> - I have a mixed relation with America. On the one hand it's a great country with amazing and open people that will gladly help a stranger, and has an amazing work ethic. On the other hand I have a problem with Americans not knowing or caring about how the rest of the world functions, how Americans define themselves in terms of their job, and their aggressiveness on the Geopolitical arena.<p><i>I believe Americas time as #1 super-power will come to an end within my lifetime</i> - I think this is already happening.",1341185880

To many of the guis and the git cli are all about tasks.  If you know what tasks map to your goals then it works out ok, but if not (as is the case for perpetual intermediates) then it is a confusing maze of bizarre commands, useless messages and copy/paste from google search results hoping one of them will work.  For context see this <a href=""http://www.drdobbs.com/goal-directed-software-design/184409952?pgno=8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drdobbs.com/goal-directed-software-design/1844099...</a><p>Git also has all of its defaults setup for large groups.  For example tags are not pushed unless you specify an additional flag.  That is absolutely the right thing to do when there are lots of developers, but the ""wrong"" thing when there are only two.<p>Nirvana for me would be a gui tool (Linux and Mac) that interoperates with projects hosted at Github and has a goal oriented interface.  It should be smart about things (eg tags not being pushed in a project of two people is worthy of attention), and it should enable a git workflow (eg topic branch, pull requests, reviews etc).  I really don't care what the git commands are to do various things - there are often several needed in some particular order with various random flags.  Just help me and other perpetual intermediates reach our goals and concentrate on our development efforts, not micromanaging a version control system.<p>Part of that also means having an attitude about the right way/best practise way of doing something.  Rather than providing endless configurable ways (and dialog boxes) to do something, pick one right way even if not everyone would agree.  An example would be to always push tags for projects with few developers.",1341185843

Probably that is not very far from the mark.<p>I think that what git brings in functionality is good enough (specially compared to non DVCSs) to make people want to use it and put the effort to understand it. On the other hand it is hard enough to use that when people finally manage to wrap their heads around it they are so proud that they must tell everybody about it.<p>It is actually quite brilliant if you think about it: Make a SW that does something really well, better than most other similar tools, but wrap it in a horrible UI to keep your users on their toes and make them proud that they are able to use it! This starts an incredible self-congratulatory feedback effect which gives notoriety to your tool.<p>If you add to that the fact that git was created by one of the most famous hackers of all time, plus the creation of GitHub, and then you get the perfect storm to make git the open-source tool of choice.<p>Mercurial on the other hand is just as useful (if not more) than git, but it is just not as hard to use. People use it, like it, but they do not need to feel proud about it. It is just easy. There is no need to talk about database details, reflogs, etc. There is no need to blog about it. It just works. This should be great and make mercurial the better tool but it has the perverse effect of not making it cool to talk about it. There is no challenge, there is no achievement in learning how to use mercurial. This makes it hard to get the same sort of buzz that you get from a tool such as git.<p>In my opinion it is a little surprising that such a knowledgeable bunch such as the Hacker News readers and the open source contributors in general are not able to evaluate both tools just in their technical merits and instead follow the buzz.

Consider the elementary abstraction of an array. The slightly less elementary one of a map.<p>Abstractions can definitely be an improvident in some cases. They just bring extra complexity at it's cost. In the 'map' case you pointed out, you now need to take into account the performance characteristics of an array, one or more hash functions and linked lists in their specific configuration.<p>Even though the lookup of a hashmap is supposed to be O(1), you now have to run a hash function for every lookup. That's bound to be slower than the simple integer addition we were doing before on the flat array.<p>Besides that, if it's a bad hash function (or if the data is bad), performance will easily go down to O(n).<p>>> So, no, just because there are layers of abstractions does not automatically mean things are going to be slow.<p>That's not what I'm saying is it? I'm making the point that it'll be slow/er/ because of the overhead of the abstraction. I didn't say ""less productive"" or ""every abstraction is bad"", I'm point out that each extra layer comes at a cost and that the extra cost gets buried the more layers you add.<p>I'm not going to go into the source control argument because I'm talking runtime application performance and mental overhead, not developer performance.",1363170257

5367666,comment,5366154,5367312,1,0,graycat,,,"Good thoughts.<p>""May I ask whether you have much experience as a\nsole proprietor or solo founder?""<p>Some!<p>""One reason a technology startup is significantly\nmore stressful than a standard business is that, by\ndefinition, you are in uncharted territory.""<p>Yes, there's some ""stress"".  My view is that making\nthings work ""in uncharted territory"" is just what\nhas to be an expected part of much of work in being\nsuccessful.<p>Generally, for everything we have that did not exist\n40,000 years ago, there was someone who did it for\nthe first time and was ""in uncharted territory"".<p>""Uncharted territory"" does not have to be just a\nshot in the dark or wildly risky; instead, in a good\ncase can have some good evidence quite early on that\nare on a promising path.  If not, then pick a new\napproach to a solution of the problem or pick a new\nproblem.  Problem selection is important.<p>You are partly right about a guy with, say, an auto\nrepair shop but in information technology, for an\nimportant problem, market, etc., having something\noriginal, much better than anything else and\ndifficult to duplicate or equal, can be an\nadvantage.<p>""With most tech startups, you have to invent a new\nbusiness model, create new technology from scratch,\nand convince customers that your never-before-seen\nproduct or service is something they should spend\ntheir hard-earned money on.""<p>Look at it this way:  Start with a problem it is\nclear the market, users, customers, etc. really have\nand really care about, and then give them the first\ngood or a much better solution.<p>So, all are trying to ""sell"" the customer on is your\nsolution for the problem he already cares about.<p>""Though there are a few general patterns available\nfor web startups to use (e.g. freemium,\nad-supported), every startup has to figure out how\nto become profitable within its particular niche.""<p>For Web sites, sell ads.  From the Meeker data at\nKPCB, the average 'charge per 1000 ads displayed'\n(CPM) of mobile and desktop is $2.125.  Then if can\nsend, on average 24 x 7, 2 Web pages a second with 4\nads per page, should be able to get monthly revenue\nof<p><pre><code>     2.125 * 4 * 2 * 3600 * 24 * 30 / 1000 =\n     44,064\n</code></pre>\ndollars.<p>Then, for a solo founder, $44,064 a month is a nice\nstart.<p>The key is to have the site deliver a 'solution' to\na problem where the solution is good enough to have\nusers request the 2 pages a second.  For that, need\nto have something some people want.<p>How many people?  Well, at least how many pages per\nmonth?  That's<p><pre><code>     2 * 3600 * 24 * 30 = 5,184,000\n</code></pre>\nSo, if each monthly 'unique' user sees 10 pages,\nthat is 5,184 monthly unique users.  There are maybe\n100 million people in the US active on the Internet\nand 1 billion in the world.<p>For sending 2 pages a second, the 'operating costs'\nof the business might be just one or two servers\nworth less than $2000 each and an Internet\nconnection that, with TV and phone, costs about $150\na month, that is, next to trivial.<p>If more users like the Web site, then the revenue\ncan grow.  So, be sure have built a 'scalable' site,\nand then add servers and Internet upload bandwidth.<p>""Writing code and designing user interfaces is\nnothing like repairing cars.  There's no doubt that\nthere are a lot of intelligent, knowledgeable\nmechanics (even some who are also software\ndevelopers), but there's a very large difference\nbetween understanding an existing system, and\ncreating a new system from nothing but keystrokes.""<p>I don't know!  As a teenager, I repaired some cars.\nAnd I've written software, e.g., created ""a new\nsystem from nothing but keystrokes"".  For me, in\nmost respects, the keystrokes are easier.<p>When I've created ""a new system from nothing but\nkeystrokes"". the challenging part was not the\nkeystrokes and not the programming but figuring out\nwhat to program.  In my case, that's been mostly\napplied math.<p>E.g., once I was working for a software house near\nDC.  Our customer was a major Navy lab.  I had a\nweek with nothing else to do, and a project was in\ntrouble, so I was sent to the project for the week.\nIn about an hour I saw that there was nothing I\ncould do for the project in a week.<p>But we were also in some competitive bidding on some\nsoftware for that lab.  I saw a problem with what\nthe lab had requested and decided to spend the week\non something risky:  I got 'smart' on the statistics\nof the measurement of power spectra, wrote some\nillustrative software, and at the end of the week\nshowed a guy from the Navy.  The Navy was pleased,\nand our company got essentially 'sole source' and\nwon the competitive bid.  If my work that week had\nfailed, then I might have been fired.  I got a\nsolution; I thought that it was fun.<p>""Most startup-worthy software projects will involve\nintense creative effort at every step of\ndevelopment, which is far more mentally taxing.""<p>A lot of work in school involves ""intense creative\neffort at every step""; e.g., one exercise was show\nthat there are no countably infinite sigma algebras,\nand the solution takes some ""intense creative effort\nat every step"".  I was the only one in the class who\ngot it, but it was fun work.<p>""A tech startup has to convince customers that they\nneed to spend money on an entirely new category of\nproduct.""<p>Well, can take my approach, ""convince""\nusers/customers that, for a problem they already\nhave and really know they have but are not really\nsolving now, they need to use ""an entirely new\ncategory of"" solution.<p>""only those who are determined beyond reason (or\nalready rich) should dream of going it alone"".<p>""Rich""?  Need routine cost of living.  But for the\nsoftware, I paid Microsoft for Windows 2000 and then\nfor the upgrade from Windows 2000 to Windows XP, but\nall the rest of the Microsoft I've been using --\nVisual Basic .NET, C/C++, .NET Framework, SQL Server\nExpress, IIS, etc. -- has been for free.  The 4000\npages of documentation from MSDN, also free.<p>When I go live I will need serious copies of Windows\nServer and SQL Server, but those are available via\nthe Microsoft BizSpark initially for free.  Now can\nplug together one heck of a computer for $2000, and\ncan get some really good Internet access, with TV\nand phone, for about $150 a month.  Don't have to be\n""rich"" to fund that.<p>""Alone""?  I'm failing to see that involving others\nwould speed the work or lower the costs.  For\nspeeding the work, nearly all the time has gone to\nmy learning enough about the relevant Microsoft\nsoftware and working around various issues, and as\nthe CEO I should know that material.  The work\nreally unique to my project has been fast, fun, and\neasy.<p>In a sense, either the solo founder really knows\nwhat the heck he is doing and is on a good path, or\nhe doesn't and isn't.  In the first case, involving\nothers will likely dilute the quality of the work\nand increase the costs, and otherwise not much can\nsave the project.<p>I don't know why you are eager to hire others\ninstead of just doing the work.",1363169993

My choice is Cloud Checklist\nhttp://apps.skybuffer.com/checklist\nfrom Skybuffer.

I can also see completed tasks from the past for up to 365 days.<p>If needed it is possible to have a print version that is clear and nice formatted.<p>I can also share my task list with friends or colleagues via email and control their authorization. So, those who should just see my list will not be able to edit it. And that is excellent!<p>The main technical idea that is implemented in Cloud Checklist is the push changes from server method, so no need to click refresh button any more, you can enjoy collaborative work and get changes to the opened in browser list immediately when it is done by another person.<p>Cloud Checklist from Skybuffer is very competitive to the market leaders solution and is the very good alternative for those who like speed, simplicity and collaborative work.",1363169747

First, there are not all that many startups to begin with, and they all do different things.  Whether it's one founder or many seems way down on the list of factors influencing the success.  If you had thousands of startups entering a single market within a short time span then maybe you could get something, but not in the current world.<p>Furthermore, I think as a founder if you concern yourself much over this point you are likely to fail.  Building a startup is a game of applying extremely limited resources, if you are focused on structural details like number of founders then you are necessarily not focused on the unique metrics of success for your business.  Of course there are pros and cons to being solo or multiple founders, but in the end a motivated individual should never let conventional wisdom get in the way of pushing forward (especially from investors who are grasping for any kind of signal to hang their hat on!).  Conversely, if a person with the right talents and skills comes along you should absolutely allow them a co-founder seat even if you planned on going it alone as this will magnify your sphere of opportunity in terms of execution potential.",1363169643

The wiki page is here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house</a><p>Basically, invest 14% more in construction up-front, and save 86% on space-heating costs over the long term.  THAT'S FUCKING HUGE!  These things are a major hit in new construction in Central and Northern Europe.<p>More, these things are pretty much exactly what you would want as a new, high-tech business for the bottom 60%, or <i>at worst</i> the bottom 80% or bottom 90%.  I mean, everyone wants to save 86% on heating, and America has a whole lot of people who live in cold, temperate climates.<p>So here's a Big Idea for the Unexotic ""Underclass"", and the middle class, too: how do we bring down the up-front cost to the point where people start being able to afford investing in energy-efficiency, particularly in cold areas that can really use this kind of thing?<p>(Because this kind of stuff doesn't even really matter to the capitalist/upper class: their utility bills are negligible versus everything else they do.)",1369846767

They work off each other and influence each other.<p>I think words are concepts. Some of the discourse of translatability in the Spanish-speaking world, especially when the source language is English, usually deals with the illogical sense of English words. Bullying is a good example, actually. Bullying comes from the Dutch word ""brother"" and its definition has drifted far away from ""fine fellow"". In Spanish, the word ""bullying"" in the 21st century English-speaking sense would be related to mean ""acosador"", which comes from the Latin cursus/currere which can probably best be defined as ""to proceed"" in English. So ""bullying"", as you suggest, might not have a one-word translation, but it could be translated as ""acosador escolar"". However, because Spanish-speakers understand the importance of world integration, ""bullying"" is also used, though you get purists and word-rebels in some regions who, incidentally, are also anti-American, anti-consumerism and sceptical of the English-speaking world in general.<p>A similar phenomenon occurs in the UK. You see certain people use an indigenous equivalent instead of adopting a standard ""London English"" word. It certainly happens in South America. So yes, culture and language are very much tied together.<p>Personally, I think Portuguese, though a romance language, really shouldn't be grouped together with Spanish, even though I can understand most of it, though I've never taken a single Portuguese course in my entire life. My understanding it has to do with studying Latin and Italian. I think the average, <i>educated</i> Spanish speaker would be able to read maybe 50% and understand spoken Brazilian Portuguese even less. Some words and pronunciations have seeped into Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia, however.",1369845219

Still, the <i>implication</i> is clearly male, just as the <i>implication</i> of the article was clearly female. (Actually, a little more than just implication, but the title sets to tone to be a little more general.)<p>One point I do still maintain is that there simply <i>is</i> a clear imbalance between sexual assault on females and males. Yes, that does not change the gravity of either, but it does suggest how the conversation about it ought to run. If it were the other way around, seeing society predominantly talk about female sexual assault would be troublesome. But it is not and thus pulling the conversation towards male sexual assault kind of rings my alarm bells. Just as the <i>implication</i> is universally female, bringing up male sexual assault <i>implies</i> trying to diminish it being a predominantly female issue.<p>It is accurate that sexual assault against females gets the center stage and it is just as correct that sexual assault against males is a serious issue.<p>Your point about sexual assaults against males being <i>rising</i> is interesting - do you happen to have a link on that? My immediate theory would be that while there might be a rise, it can only ever be a rise in <i>reported</i> assault. So I would guess that it is probably increased by the fact that we as a society have become more open to accept males as victims of sexual assault in the first place. But I would be interested in seeing actual data on that.",1369845149

I say this as a MS holder who did not complete a thesis and regret it (much more than leaving grad school, which was the right decision for me).<p>I did (thankfully) participate in research, so I can always talk about the research work even without a publication track record.  I have published since in different formats, so that worked out.<p>But, and this is a crucial issue, a MS in CS of any type helps get you past the HR filter at big companies.  When I completed mine, it meant a significant boost in starting salary right out of the gate. If you're looking to join IBM or Microsoft, you probably need to think hard about that signaling credential . . .<p>Ignoring the disconnect between the academic CS experience and the reality of what most CS programmers work on in the day job, the biggest challenge I see for new practitioners is building a portfolio of software work that a hiring org can understand well enough to make a hiring or interview decision on.  How do you communicate that ability and drive to hiring managers outside of your personal network?  Do these combined BS/MS programs (e.g., a year of additional coursework to finish off a coursework-only MS) or simply hitting grad school still work better than saying, hey, here is my open-source implementation of path expressions for concurrency control in Common Lisp?",1369844859

Precision: hitting the same spot repeatedly.<p>The paper is correct - these measurements hit the same spot repeatedly. Accuracy in this context is a tricky thing. The SI second is defined by the Cesium standard, but the best Cesium clocks are >100 times less precise. These two clocks are hitting the same tiny spot over and over again somewhere within the fuzzy bullseye that is the Cesium target.

Even at that, I have been impressed during my lifetime, which appears to be longer than yours, at what body types that used to be considered ""impossible"" for top performance in some sports have since been vindicated as the body types of champions. For example, before Usain Bolt set Olympic records after training very hard, he was believed to be too tall to be a successful sprinter.<p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/recycled/2009/08/taking_sprinting_to_new_heights.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/recycled/200...</a><p>The way to find out what body types strictly limit sports performance is to have people of all body types come out for the sport and engage in deliberate practice, and see what happens.

It just states that it takes 10,000 hours for a talented person to become good at a field - that a person untalented in a field won't necessarily become a true expert given enough practise.<p>To me this seems intuitively obvious - people's brains aren't built alike, and if we're willing to accept that brains at the fringes (e.g. aspergers) are more attuned to certain tasks, it's not too out there to suggest variance within the 'normal' parameters too.  Of course, proving it would require a complex test - one that (somehow) sorts people into attuned or unattuned on a given subject to begin with, and then makes them work for 10,000 hours on the subject.<p>Realistically, though, I suppose this question just isn't all that interesting.  A lot of the time, the important part of the 'nature' component is simply what you're interested in.  If you happen to have an interest in a subject, you're vastly more likely to put in the 10,000 hours.  I'm a good computer programmer because I enjoyed and was good at it from the beginning, so I spent more time at it.  I'm a terrible dancer because I spent maybe a hundred hours on it, sucked, and lost interest.  Maybe if I'd spent a hundred times longer doing it I'd be a world beater, maybe not - but it doesn't matter, because my initial experience was enough to put me off.

Whether you want to use the 5th Amendment or something else as an argument to support that, is irrelevant.  Bottom line, as a student, you absolutely have the right to wad the survey up, throw it in the trash and say ""fuck this"".  Yes, you may get detention, or suspended from school, but no one has any authority to use force to compel you to fill out a frickin' survey.<p>What we need here, are more people who are willing to spit in the face of so-called ""authority"" and take back a little bit of their own power and sovereignty.  Just because ""they"" told you to do something, does not mean you actually have to do it.<p>Edit:  To elaborate more on this, per rayiner's comments, let me add this:  I believe the bit about the teacher telling the kids they can skip the survey due to the 5th Amendment protection is <i>approximately</i> correct, given the context.  That is, it's a potentially viable legal argument and certainly not something one can dismiss out of hand.  Given that the class wasn't a law-school class, that level of approximation strikes me as totally reasonable.<p>The more interesting point, however, is that whether or not the 5A applies here is kind of irrelevant, since there's a bigger issue at stake.  And that is what the 2nd paragraph above is getting at.  Forget the Constitution, forget the Bill of Rights, forget the SCOTUS, etc.... none of those things grant us rights.  Ultimately, we have the rights we are willing to demand, and willing and able to defend, and that's regardless of what some ""authority"" figure tries to sell us.",1369843702

On the face of it, you're slinging mud at walls and, of course, some may stick. In other words, your claims may be on point <i>some</i> of the time. <i>Some</i> Yale students (undergraduate or graduate) may have had literate, educated parents. Mine aren't. Many others here could say similar things. <i>Some</i> Yale students may have come from Andover, Loomis Chaffee, and the like. Not all. And I'm willing to bet there are numerous students who came from high schools like the ones you describe. Or, as in at least a few cases, came from ""schools"" that were essentially converted sheds or barns. <i>Some</i> Yale students may not have had to worry about taking care of their families or being the breadwinner during adolescence. But others did. <i>Some</i> Yale students may not have lived in shady areas. Many did.<p>We're an intelligent lot, certainly. And certainly there are many others who are much more intelligent than us. But Yale does not exist to serve the world. Yale is not a public service. Yale is exclusive by design. You don't get here by being intelligent, but by the same token, being here does not mean we're more intelligent than you (in the plural sense). The fifteen year funnel notion that the other person described is, in fact, much more a filter of ability, grit, and exceptional achievement than you could ever dream of. A minority of students here come from the sort of Gatsby-ish background that popular myth suggests. There are students here who may not be the most intelligent in the world (certainly, not all of us are MENSA members), but they are, for the most part, people who have proved time and again their exceptional qualities. There is a reason this institution has been an incubator for leaders around the world.<p>Yale is not a meritocracy. Yale is one among a few institutions that have carefully cultivated the ability to choose from an exceptional pool of human beings each year. If you point out the issue of legacy admits, I'd ask: why not? Why not give back to those who have given to Yale? I don't simply mean monetary contributions, though certainly I would wish to signal appreciation of someone who has endowed a chair, a library, or has done something to grow Yale as an institution. But, in general, if someone has reflected well on Yale, then I believe it is worth nurturing that relationship. So, yes, not all legacy admits are evil.<p>The world is not equal, and equality is not a given. We will never be equal, as long as scarcity exists. But instead of whining about how ""all Yale students are privileged"" and thereby exposing your own prejudices and jaundiced perceptions, why not make the best of your circumstances, much as we have of ours?",1369843503

This transformation in how to design and present content will accelerate learning by making the impenetrable accessible.<p>He's making this his life's work, and it's clear he has spent countless hours pondering and working it. A hallmark of a genius is a rare and valuable perspective -- a unique mental model -- that has been built up over time through long periods of deep contemplation. As a result, these rare and valuable perspectives enable you to see what few (if any) have seen before.<p>Bret sees a lever that will amplify human understanding, and he knows how to get there.<p>The difficulty is transferring his mental model to others because the gaps in understanding are often too great. We might get a glimpse of what he sees, but it will be only a sliver until we have explored what he's explored from every angle and have reconstructed the model in our mind.<p>Part of the challenge is showing others how to get to this golden lever, but the first step is to others to recognize its significance so they are inspired to begin the journey. This is what he meant by influence. However, inspiring others to take action can be hard when they begin with only a fuzzy notion of what he sees.<p>But notice the premise of his talk is about providing a solution to this problem. By fundamentally redesigning our interfaces to knowledge, it will be easier for one to transfer their mental model to others -- he states this premise at the beginning. His talk provided a glimpse into what's possible -- to help people snap out of fixed mindsets and point them toward a path beyond incremental improvement. The examples he provided weren't the end game --  they are just the beginning -- meant to whet our appetite.<p>Seeing his work and watching his presentations, you feel his passion and know he lives with these ideas ruminating in the back of his mind everyday. He has explored them farther than almost anyone else in the world.<p>Shinichi Mochizuki is another recent example of someone exploring an idea and following it out to a place no one else can see.<p>Mochizuki spent years working on a proof for the ABC conjecture (<a href=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/11/03/abc-proof-too-tough-even-for-mathematicians/o9bja4kwPuXhDeDb2Ana2K/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/11/03/abc-proof-too-to...</a>). Mochizuki posted four papers for the proof on his website, but he has yet to publicly engage the mathematics community.<p>During this process, he invented his own language -- he was in a mathematical world no one had seen or conceived before -- so his papers have been impenetrable to the world's top mathematicians. The gaps in understanding are too great.<p>When Bret said he decided to present on ""what the audience needs to hear"", I suspect he's starting slow by giving them a glimpse of what he sees, rather than trying to distill everything into an hour talk. He's trying to influence people to think beyond their preconceived notions of what's possible. He's trying to get them to think different -- to inspire their work by illuminating a path that leads to transformative understanding.",1369843364

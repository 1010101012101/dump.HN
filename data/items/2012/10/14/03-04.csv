There are multiple kinds of red shift.<p>> ""Redshifts are attributable to the Doppler effect, familiar in the changes in the apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles; an observed redshift due to the Doppler effect occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. <i>Cosmological redshift is seen due to the expansion of the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase of their distance from Earth.</i> Finally, gravitational redshifts are a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field.""<p>The increasing distance between stars <i>due to expansion</i> is not velocity as we traditionally think of it.  Things that far away get red-shifted because at distances that large expansion becomes a factor, not because of how they are otherwise moving about.  It's basically the general idea behind Hubble's Law.",1350187129

My left-wing friends regarded this as the most cynical thing they'd ever heard, but they didn't have much evidence or analysis against it.<p>Politicians want a powerful state because their power derives from their influence over that state.  They want their power to grow because no one is ever satisfied with what they have.<p>If the US has a Serratta, it would be in the impossibility of doing business without managing political relations, and thus the exclusion of people with serious interests from any serious effort to reform the state.

And MeeGo wasn't the lifeboat they needed.<p>MeeGo was fancy, but too incipient as a platform to compete against iOS/Android. No developers, no industry support, no technical expertise within the company to develop it (plus the political fights with Symbian). It'd be a long, slow, expensive and bumpy road ahead. It'd cost him 3-4 years of development time, and the the board and investors would crush him well before he could deliver on the plan.<p>Symbian was completely f-ed up, broken to its core, so this was never an option (and it's laughable to read ""Symbian was winning"" as put by the OP).

Even so far as the taxes and regulations being details (a couple percent here or there, not a crisis).<p>The issue that we are facing though, is starting to become of another sort. It is evidenced by the shift of wealth from the commercial centers to the DC area.  It is evidenced by 80% of government spending not being on running government or protecting the population or even enforcing laws, etc.  It is evidenced by (what was quoted in the article) of goverment borrowing (and printing money) to support the oligarghical too-big to fail banks.  It is evidenved by the nationalization of private sector debt via student loans and via housing loan guarantees.  It is evidenced by the failure to regulate derivatives or split investment banks from commercial ones.<p>It is evidenced by ""Economists"" in the keynesian tradition who support uncritical borrow and spend (as the answer to everything), all of which provides stability but none of which provides actual earnings/power to the working classes...etc. It just provides benefits to the rich and debt/taxes to the poor.

You are not. But due to the fact that you sound exactly like me some years ago. Hopefully, the following lines will save you the trouble I faced, and the failures I had to crawl out of.<p><i>Marketing is mostly about deception and half-truths, and promoting a product effectively means maximizing the positives and minimizing/omitting the negatives: ""Look at this shiny car!"" (engine leaks oil) ""Buy our shiny lightweight computer!"" (can't change battery) etc...</i><p>Marketing is about showcasing the world your ideas. It is not about deception, although some people do deceieve others through it. Real marketing, the one you and me experience at a hundred percent is something that you don't realize exists. You never heard it. Saw it. Or even thought of it. It simply resonates with your ideas, your self, and your values. The aroma of a pure rythmic parallelism between us and what we want to become. That is marketing.<p>In the 1980's, when Steve Jobs set out to market Apple, he understood the true meaning of marketing. Jobs set out to showcase the world the ideas behind Apple. That is why the original series of advertisements set out to show Apple as more than a computer company. It was an idea. A new idea. The computer did not have to be boring, or tied down to social structures. It was fun. Modern. The future. Apple was about freedom from the regular business computer. \nThat idea is still living these days in the form of iDevices and Macs. In a world of boring Windows-based PCs, the Apple computer and device are still showcasing the original Apple idea. There is a better way to use technology. Such way is the Apple way (according to their marketing, not my opinion).<p>Did it work for Apple? Yes. Did Jobs set out to deceive people? No. Could they have sold millions and millions of devices based on a marketing lie? No.<p>The problem with us hackers is that we tend to forget that the world is not all black and white. Not every salesman is out to get us. Some really do want to help us. Like that insurance agent selling Cancer policies. Go ahead and talk to one of them. Ask them how many people has the policies he sells saved from starving. How many children will have an education or even a roof to live because their deceased parent bought a Cancer policy from him/her. For a programmer, a Cancer policy is just a lottery. For the rest of the world, it can be the difference between life and death. That is why they are marketed like that. It is real.",1350185812

At the bottom and in the middle, American society is fraying, and the children of these struggling families are lagging the rest of the world at school.<p>I laugh when people write things like these. I am an Indian, staying in Bangalore. If you say the US is struggling, I would say you have no clue about other parts of the world. You have no clue what struggling means, no clue what hunger means, no clue what poverty or lack of education or health care means. Think of it this way, even the poorest in the US would be like 10x better of than the poorest in the other parts of the world.<p>>> Economists point out that the woes of the middle class are in large part a consequence of globalization and technological change.<p>I would say these changes are good for the US and the world in general. A lot of co operation and competition means things will move quickly.<p>>> Tolerance for high executive compensation has increased, even as the legal powers of unions have been weakened and an intellectual case against them has been relentlessly advanced by plutocrat-financed think tanks.<p>Sorry, is the word Tolerance the right word? It makes it sound like some sort of a criminal scam is going around in those circles which every one needs to put up with.<p>Sorry but the author seems to point what we generally call as 'Socialist guilt'. The problem is people automatically label the ambitious, hardworking and people who look for big rewards as greedy. This problem is an unfortunate consequence of communism and to an extent socialism in general. Unless these people are made to believe that there is inherent evilness in money and desire for it, they really can't sell their philosophy. The direction in which a communist thinks is to visualize money and in general wealth as a minimal thing merely required for survival. And other things are also pushed, like for example glorifying poverty- Promoting rationing of things etc.<p>The author fails to understand why there are 1%'s anyway. Which is that a capitalist society believes the rewards are not fixed, but vary with effort applied towards the work done to achieve goals. Its not like somebody just called a person in the cabin and wrote them $1 million check. You are selling something and somebody is ready to pay a price for it. This of course requires working hard, taking risks and going through tough times to get there. Not everybody would like to do that, because some people are just happy with what they have now. But just because those people don't want a little extra, it doesn't mean those who want it and earn must share their rewards with others.<p>The fact is nearly everybody wants to be rich, some just convince themselves they don't want to after considering the effort they need to expend to get rich. But later when they look at somebody getting rich, they just happen to either proceed with all this drama.<p>Unless you are ill, or disabled or limited for another genuine reason can't work to get successful, you just can't blame somebody else for your problems.",1350184403

8078336,comment,8060784,8061965,1,0,dtaht,,,"I&#x27;d rather like better data on the problem you describe, as it does not seem to line up with the experimental data I have so far on the interaction of AQM and packet scheduling techniques with bittorrent.<p>The first paper we did was: <a href=""http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~drossi/paper/rossi13tma-b.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~drossi/paper/rossi13tma-b...</a><p>Which predated the development of fq_codel, which is the fair queue (flow queue) + aqm hybrid now deployed in cerowrt, openwrt, and countless other QoS systems. That paper only explored RED or SFQ, not a hybrid.<p>What I think the positive effects we are seeing now are several factors. 1) a &quot;torrent&quot; is usually on 6 flows at a time, rotating to a new flow every 15 seconds or so. 2) The additional peers trying to negotiate IS a problem at very low rates (say below 4mbit) but invisible at higher rates. 3) reducing latencies under load to under 5ms has enormous gains in bidirectional throughput, which more than compensate for losing torrent&#x27;s delay based backoff mechanism, which only backs off at 100ms. Which would you rather have, 100ms latency or 5ms?<p>See, for example, what the fq_codel system does for verizon and comcast here:<p><a href=""https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki/RRUL_Rogues_Gallery"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki/RRUL_Rogues_...</a><p>We got back 5x free bandwidth on the verizon test. And if you are experiencing 5ms worth of latency does it really matter if you have 6 torrents in the background?<p>(80, yes! but it&#x27;s a function of your bandwidth also and... and... more testing is indicated.)<p>... so I haven&#x27;t got around to redoing the research and writing a successor paper on it, and probably won&#x27;t anytime soon. The original authors of that paper have gone off to do several papers of extensive analyses of RED vs ledbat, and I think they&#x27;ve largely gone off into the weeds, not that I mind having that analysis as a basis if ever we (or someone) gets around to analyzing fq_codel with some of those techniques.<p>Please feel free to test re torrent with a system that uses something like openwrt&#x27;s qos-scripts or cerowrt&#x27;s SQM system.<p>The conclusion of the original paper was that only classification seemed to be an answer to even further deprioritize torrent in an AQM&#x27;d and FQ&#x27;d world. (which the above systems can do also)<p><a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hoeiland-joergensen-aqm-fq-codel-00"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hoeiland-joergensen-aqm-fq-...</a><p><a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nichols-tsvwg-codel-02"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nichols-tsvwg-codel-02</a>",1406179786

8078306,comment,8077690,8077983,1,0,srcreigh,,,"I wrote a report about how using Objective-C categories to implement UIViewController feature modules can be really elegant. [1] The same would be true, I imagine, for what would be Swift&#x27;s multiple inheritance. The following is a quick summary of this report, with thoughts about multiple inheritance.<p>You may find yourself having a set of UIViewControllers that implement overlapping subsets of the features that your app provides (i.e. one controller has features A and B, another has features B and C, a third has features C and A).<p>One method of solving this is to create helper modules that implement the features A, B, and C. In your controllers, you can then set up the appropriate subset of helper modules. There are a few problems with this: 1) there&#x27;s still boilerplate code; 2) the implementation can be subtle (make sure to retain the reference to all your helper classes!).<p>This can be <i>elegantly</i> solved with Objective-C categories (by creating a category for each feature) or, I imagine, what multiple inheritance would look like in Swift. Instead of boilerplate helper module initialization and subtle implementation, your ABUIViewController could inherit from abstract AUIViewController and BUIViewController base classes to get both features for free in virtual methods.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://srcreigh.github.io/blog/posts/modular-uiviewcontroller-features/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://srcreigh.github.io/blog/posts/modular-uiviewcontrolle...</a>",1406179051

Either you shut it down completely (and then back on later), or you lose it completely.<p>If you leave cities connected, and the solar solar storm hits, then the cities are without power for a much longer period of time than if you took preemptive measures - with all the risks of crime that follow. Also, I&#x27;ll refer to the 2003 blackout for a dry run of the mayhem that will unfold in the face of a vast power outage (ie. not much), and in this case, you&#x27;ll even be able to provide a quite fair number of hours warning, so most people should be able to get home - you won&#x27;t have a million office workers stranded in Manhattan. Hoarding will happen, though, and it won&#x27;t be pretty. That survivalist nutcase guy at the end of the street will have a field day when he struts out of his well-stocked bunker after the power comes back on.<p>The PR nightmare of having shut down the grid for a few hours with warning (presumably, you&#x27;ll shut it down immediately before the hit is expected, so if you&#x27;re wrong, you can turn it back on fairly quickly[1]) is much, much lighter than frying the entire nations electrical grid, causing trouble for <i>years</i> because you acted against advice from your NASA director. Also, if he was wrong, the NASA director will make a pretty good fall guy and it won&#x27;t even be all that unfair.

It used two arrays of jump instructions: one jump for each current NFA state, jumping into the machine code that had been compiled for the regex.

But the new wrinkle was, it also wrote more jump instructions into the <i>other</i> array, for the next-state set of the NFA matcher.<p>Unlike the MIX, the IBM 709 had a jump-through-register instruction, so self-modifying code wasn&#x27;t necessary.

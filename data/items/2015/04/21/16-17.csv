It is especially good to read as you&#x27;re setting out on life, e.g. halfway through college.<p>One story I&#x27;ve heard about David Copperfield: in Russian monasteries, there are abbots who forbid novices from reading any spiritual literature until they&#x27;ve first read David Copperfield, because while the goal of the monastic life is to become more like God, first you have to become human.<p>For the Russians, especially Dostoevsky, if there is a translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, that&#x27;s the one to pick. It makes a huge difference.<p>As a college senior, after devouring pretty much all of Dostoevsky, I read Anna Karenina largely because in <i>On Moral Fiction</i> it is John Gardner&#x27;s favorite example of a great novel---and it was so <i>boring</i>. Now that I&#x27;m 38 I think often of re-reading it, if I can work up the gumption. I&#x27;m glad to hear you found it not so heavy.<p>A favorite English professor in his 60s told me he was still re-reading Crime and Punishment, but Brothers Karamazov didn&#x27;t speak to him anymore, and he felt it was a young man&#x27;s book.

Maybe a better question is, why don&#x27;t all the auto companies, which already cooperate and &quot;collude&quot; on a lot of things, have similar licenses?   There are little niche markets for modifying the software in cars,  they even make movies about it.  If there is some sort of financial protection to the manufacturer, I&#x27;d think they&#x27;d do similar things for certain cars, perhaps the ones that don&#x27;t have performance enthusiasts, like minivans or something.   I can think of some very real reasons where a company like Ford or Toyota would like to make sure you only use &quot;sanctioned parts&quot; for repairs and DRM could help them to verify that other parts aren&#x27;t usable; they don&#x27;t seem to be doing that though.<p>I&#x27;m just guessing here, but I know Deere produces some fairly sophisticated software that takes over head photos of crops and they have various services that offer advice on how to best farm different parts of a farmer&#x27;s land.  Some of that software interacts with their farm equipment (like it can signal the onboard software to maybe work more slowly in particularly dense parts of a crop and stuff like that.)   I could see them trying to somehow protect that software investment and treat it as a lock-in where the device owners may want to use that service with other brands of equipment or something.

The problem is that the manufacturers mix leasing and owning. I.e. you own the device, but lease the software. I think that everyone would be radically happier if you either leased everything or owned everything. This is partly because when we buy something at a store, we expect to own it, not own part of it and lease the rest. This leads to the price of the object being higher than what you would actually pay if you were going to only lease it. In a world where nobody owns tractors and just leases them, we would still be fine because nobody would pay full price for a tractor every month, but rather only what would make sense economically.",1429634974

Tractor firmware, Adobe Photoshop and that digital copy of the U2 album you didn&#x27;t want are all software, but they&#x27;re expressions of very different things with distinguishing characteristics. In the case of the tractor firmware, an obvious distinguishing characteristic is that the firmware is just as critical to the function of the tractor as any mechanical part. I don&#x27;t see any reason why the law couldn&#x27;t mandate that you own your <i>copy</i> of that firmware. (Actually, I don&#x27;t see any reason why the law couldn&#x27;t mandate that in all the cases I mentioned; I think people on both sides of the IP debate are making a categorical error by assuming that the zero marginal cost of software reproduction changes everything. It doesn&#x27;t. It just changes, well, the marginal cost.)<p>In another comment, I think you said that you thought describing this as &quot;challenging the notion of ownership&quot; as pandering to the (presumably anti-IP) audience.

Is there a reason that you have to sit down and plan to only do that? If you have a well prioritized backlog and the freedom to get work done these scenario&#x27;s should be more like:<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s work on adding this new feature here.&quot; &quot;Ok that&#x27;s a good one, we&#x27;ll need to do a, b, and c to get it all wired up, working and tested.

What&#x27;s next?&quot; It was always a discussion of the most valuable thing to get done and any collateral issues that could also be fixed. In this case, we often got more done.<p>Second, if you had a pair partner sitting around doing nothing, there is a problem. They aren&#x27;t engaged. They either need to become engaged or not be in an environment where there is paired programming. That is ok! But they need to admit it and move on.<p>Pairing works well if you have the people and processes in place to allow it to work well.

If users and the market aren&#x27;t dying for mobile sites, why is google unilaterally forcing them down everyone&#x27;s throats via the completely unrelated pagerank system?

Certainly there is a bubble in asset prices now, presuming interest rates do not remain zero or negative forever.<p>The great irony is that at some point extra money can deflate prices rather than increase depending on where that money is applied. E.g. build enough solar panel factories in China and eventually everyone gets to flood the market with cheap solar panels. So it is not clear that more cheap money will increase prices for a very long time. The second irony is if the Fed and other central banks hit their goal of increase prices, the wealthy won&#x27;t feel anything but it will hit the poor and middle classes very, very hard. As in choosing when to eat meals hard.<p>The thing most analysts miss is there is all of this &#x27;new&#x27; money but we still have huge future liability holes. This is both with debt which requires future cashflows to pay off along with future promises which may not be able to be met. This is very apparent in underfunded pension funds. Despite many different metrics pointing to all time highs in US stock market valuations (many ways to cut this pie) we still have big pensions funds that are 50% funded or less (Illinois & Chicago for one.) That is with expected 7%+ returns year after year in to the future. If their future gains are a lot lower its even worse. Pension fund problems are visible, insurance, annuities, etc are opaque. There could be huge problems there still. Banks aren&#x27;t even that well capitalized still.<p>We could imagine quantitative easing, money printing, and cheap money as something that could be shoveled in to huge holes of &quot;negative&quot; money. As long as those huge holes exist, the stimulus is not going to perform as expected. If the stimulus is through more debt its plausible these holes are staying the same or getting larger. Certainly it is possible that all of this money has done a great deal already including preventing wide spread bank failures.<p>My general thesis is we are in a period of time where technology and monetary policy are in direct and absolute conflict with each other. Monetary policy is totally reliant on inflation to pay off future debt and claims. On the other hand, technology is about delivering more at a much cheaper price. We want a market for $1000 iPhones, not $1 billion iPhones. We want software that delivers 1000x more value to a customer, not that costs 1000x more. Fuck, hn wouldn&#x27;t be here and we would all be living in a bizarre universe if things were the other way around.

You control that one, and only that one, instance of the thing.<p>Intangibles can be given/sold to another party without relinquishing your use of the original (because copies are free).  You can buy one CD and gives copies of the music on it to 1,000,000 people without cost, and without giving up your right to the original.  Even if you could copy an engine for relatively cheaply, the same economics do not apply.<p>Therefore, an exception exists to our physical property laws to cover this edge case: copyright law.  As userbinator notes, there are other areas of intellectual property law that may apply to physical goods (e.g. patents), but you asked what the difference is between digital programming and mechanical: the difference is that digital programming is intangible, so it can be copied ad naseum, so the ownership exception we call copyright law applies.",1429633624

That means that while prices would rise for a time, they would then fall for a time.<p>That made borrowing less attractive since there wasn&#x27;t an implicit guarantee that you&#x27;ll pay back the loan with money worth less than what was loaned to you.  In other words, get $X buying power now, pay back $0.8X buying power over time.  It&#x27;s a slam dunk.<p>After the 40s (and the war) there was a brief flirtation with deflation and then by the 60s inflation was in full force.  Eventually people realized this was happening and a few years later Nixon nixed (HA!) the gold standard here in the US.<p>Once that happened it became incredibly obvious that inflation, borrowing and not really paying for it was the new standard move if you had half a brain.  Businesses got it very quickly.  Most of the population in the US has yet to realize it, otherwise it would have been changed by now.<p>EDIT: Given the regular changes to the way CPI is calculated I&#x27;m not sure I entirely agree with the reported numbers.  I suspect that they&#x27;re actually a few percent higher, so inflation has probably averaged not 4% for the last 30 years, but more like 6-7%<p>1.04 ^ 30 = 3.24<p>1.07 ^ 30 = 7.61<p>If that were the case it would explain a lot of the inequality.  If inflation is 6-7% and returns have been averaging 8% (this is what most pensions assume they can get and shoot for) then your real rate of return is a pittance, almost not worth mentioning.

Being unable to communicate efficiently would not be effective propaganda.

We thought they were doing this other thing!&quot;.<p>Digg.com had to send a cease and desist letter to one Chinese propaganda wing to get them to stop mucking up their website.

Fortunately, I think that even with a few smaller Linode instances, I can reasonably base on ArangoDB such that I scale it when my app needs to scale.<p>To press on about issue one, in a general sense, what I like about ArangoDB is the thoughts behind it and the continous execution of those thoughts. Is memory an issue? Possibly. Is the team aware of memory-mapped files&#x27; limitation? Yes. Will they improve in future release? Probably based on the excellent work they&#x27;ve produced in the past.<p>Their implementation of graphs is interesting to the general point. ArangoDB presently stores relationships in a collection. This won&#x27;t scale. Neo4J&#x27;s free book on graph databases explains why[1]. Fortunately, the ArangoDB team has a graph API (I&#x27;m in the process of implementing that now for Clojure [2]). This means, when they move to a more scalable architecture, I and anyone who use the API should be golden.<p>By the way, I&#x27;m a proponent of ArangoDB. Just in case that wasn&#x27;t clear.

In Utah, there was a thriving edited DVD rental business during this time.  Essentially, Mom and Pop shops would buy a DVD, take out the sex, language, and violence, and rent the edited version.<p>Hollywood complained that these companies were illegally making copies, so the mom and pop rental stores started to include the original copy as well with the edited copy, to prove that they were not making illegal copies.<p>Ultimately, all of these companies were put out of business because the courts ruled that just because you bought a DVD, you don&#x27;t have the rights to modify it because it causes &quot;irreparable injury to the creative artistic expression in the copyrighted movies&quot;.  I find it interesting that the issue was harming the creative artistic expression, not financial at all, since, they were not pirating the films, so in truth, Hollywood was selling more DVD&#x27;s since people who wouldn&#x27;t normally watch a movie with 75 f-words in it, might actually watch the edited version.<p>Of course, in today&#x27;s world, there&#x27;s not many products that we can buy that did not have artistic expression involved in building that product.  My house was artistically designed by an architect, if I don&#x27;t like the kitchen, would I offend his artistic expression by remodeling?

I can remember a few in the past suddenly filled with commenters writing in broken English that there was no bubble for X, Y, Z reasons. While I did not at the time, I now wonder if some of our commenters here are employed by the Chinese government.<p>I&#x27;ve been following Michael Pettis quite closely. Great analyst, understands and explains the global balance of payments very well, lives in China, etc. His opinion has moved from &#x27;China needs to rebalance&#x27; to wording that sounds like he&#x27;s not sure there is going to be much growth for a long time.<p>China&#x27;s growth for some time has been the result of malinvestment on a massive scale. At minimum since 2008, possibly even before that. The factories that we think could be productive and producing things people really want at the right price could be in that position because of very negative inputs (unaccounted for pollution, interest rates being subsidized by someone else, etc.) Fundamentally, when you have an economy growing at a rate above the interest rate, many companies can just overgrow their debt while taking on new debt. Unprofitable operations can be hidden for decades.<p>It is now within the realm of possibility that China could see 1-2% growth for decades ahead. In short term, I would expect negative GDP growth. Based on what has happened to the price of oil (and other raw materials), and the drop in high end consumption due to a &#x27;corruption crackdown&#x27; this could already be underway.<p>In general this should be a good thing.

9415019,comment,9414026,9414863,0,0,ChrisLomont,,,"Inflation and deflation were terrible when on the gold standard [1], and the terrible volatility was a reason every single country in the world left gold standards. The research from the great depression demonstrating that having one&#x27;s currency tied to the rate one can dig up metal, instead of tied to the needs for trade, put the nail in the coffin. See also the list of US recessions, and the behavior before and after the gold standard was removed [2].<p>When volatility is high, everyone has to have higher prices to help plan for an uncertain future, so it is a drain on all aspects of an economy. If inflation were zero, then planning could be perfect, and there would be a much more efficient system. However, zero inflation is nearly impossible to do, since there are accidents, demand shocks, wars, and other events that shake an economy. History has shown that deflation can lead to a deflationary spiral, seriously damaging an economy and putting everyone out of work, so the Fed targets slight inflation. This provides protection against runaway deflation and also provides stable, predictive economy so people and businesses can plan. See, for example, the Great Moderation and related literature [3].<p>The CPI is quite accurate, and matches multiple other places that also measure inflation, such as the MIT based Billion Prices project [4]. If CPI and actual inflation were vastly different, there would be a host of financial products one could invest in that capture the difference, since many items are tied to formal CPI. Knowing people that work in places that would create such trades, if CPI were as far off as you claim, I&#x27;ve asked them, and they say there is no arbitrage. Can you show me where people are consistently making money trading with their &quot;better&quot; knowledge of inflation versus the standard CPI? Finally, if inflation were 10%-30%, as you claim, then prices would double every 2-7 years, which is clearly wrong. Using your claims, prices from 1971 till now (2015-1971=44 years) would be 80 =2^(44/7) to 4,000,000 = 2^(44/2) times higher, which is clearly false, bordering on ridiculous.<p>You&#x27;re also wrong about who benefits from inflation: basically borrowers (you and me and mortgage holders, etc) owe less money in real terms, and lenders will get paid back less than they lent, in real terms. Over the life of a loan, future fixed payments are easier to make, not harder.<p>So inflation transfers value from lenders to borrowers, not the other way around. Inflation hurts banks and benefits borrowers. You have your claims backwards.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~ekerschn/courses/c150042/lectures/09_flations.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~ekerschn/courses/c150042/lecture...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_Unite...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Moderation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Moderation</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://bpp.mit.edu/about-us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bpp.mit.edu/about-us/</a>",1429632586

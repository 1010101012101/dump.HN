As long as they have some sort of social ""hallway pass"" to escape the repercussions, and thus guilt, of their (in)action (such as ""I was drunk"" or ""he was wearing a lab coat"" or ""it was for a movie/documentary they're making"" or ""it will stop terrorists"") they'll do whatever depraved things you like, and allow similarly depraved things to be done to them.<p>I call this the ""Girls Gone Wild"" hypothesis, although it's probably a corollary to Milgram (though one testable with less ethical questionability, certainly.)",1290477579

But this isn't black or white stuff... this is grey area that lots of people have different opinions about.  By all means critique facebook - by all means critique those who have partnered with facebook.<p>But demanding that someone else must come in on the fight on your side or your going to denounce them publicly on their site, is a pretty horrible - either your with us, or your against us - sort of mentality.

Hence the risk of being killed in a traffic accident is on the order of 100 times greater than that of being killed by a terrorist attack against aviation.<p>Now consider how willing most drivers are to trade a marginal increase in accident risk for a marginal increase in convenience (say driving 10 MPH over the posted speed limit to arrive at one's destination early).<p>In light of these risk preferences it is hardly surprising that many travelers are outraged at being forced by the government to undergo a humiliating and degrading procedure for such a minimal (and disputed at that) decrease in risk.",1290477459

1932132,comment,1929167,1930843,0,0,brc,,,"Your comment loses value through the unmitigated bias showing through.  You had me until 'Psychotic Right' as though viewing the problems through a left/right filter is the explanation.<p>The fact is we'll never know what would have happened if large companies were allowed to fail, because they weren't.  It might have been worse, it might have been better.  For sure it would have been worse in the short term, but these issues should be measured over the medium to long term.  One of the messages that has been sent out with the current handling is that there is a Fed put on any high risk adventure, and that's not good.<p>Personally I think that there is something to be said for the 'bandaid' approach.  Not sticking something over the top to cover the problems, but a short sharp shock of pulling it off and let the problems be.<p>The problem with the bailouts is that they cover over the fact that some companies were allowed to fail. Lehman, for one.  And the world didn't stop turning.  Sure, this caused liquidity problems and risk premiums to escalate dramatically, to the detriment of employment and the real economy.  But it's foolish to pretend that this isn't going to happen anyway.  The problem with Krugman and others is that they believe a lack of demand is the problem.  They view the problem through this prism, and as such they come up with solutions that match their world view.<p>Others (including me) say that perhaps the problem is excessive debt.  And until that excessive debt is eliminated from the system, productive companies are unable to make use of the resources tied up in the unproductive ones currently taking shelter with public money.  You say the institutions should be kept alive, I say that they should be destroyed and the buildings and staff and infrastructure released to new institutions who can find a way to be competitive.<p>I believe you shouldn't look at the problem in terms of a company or bank failing.  That's just the symptom. Once the debt had built up excessively, it was only a matter of time and method for the companies to fail. The problem was watering down of regulation that had stood the test of time for 70 years, and regulators becoming toothless.  So far, this hasn't been fixed.<p>This is a not a left/right blue/red debate.  It is a debate as to the level that central governments should take in directing and manipulating markets. Neither 'side' is debating this. Nobody will try and defend central planning and a command economy, because it is comprehensively proven as a failed model, yet we seem to be reversing backwards into this situation on the say-so of a bunch of people who couldn't see the problems headed their way.  They don't seem to realise that controlling the fundamentals of money (supply and price) causes wrong investment choices through inappropriate price signalling. And then they try and correct those choices by further fiddling with central control instead of letting the chips fall where they will fall.  Because they're going to do this eventually - no amount of bailing out will fix a fundamentally out-of-date business model.",1290476485

Here's some data:<p>A typical dental X-ray exposes the patient to about 2 millirems of radiation. According to one widely cited estimate, exposing each of 10,000 people to one rem (that is, 1,000 millirems) of radiation will likely lead to 8 excess cancer deaths. Using our assumption of linearity, that means that exposure to the 2 millirems of a typical dental X-ray would lead an individual to have an increased risk of dying from cancer of 16 hundred-thousandths of one percent. Given that very small risk, it is easy to see why most rational people would choose to undergo dental X-rays every few years to protect their teeth.<p>More importantly for our purposes, assuming that the radiation in a backscatter X-ray is about a hundredth the dose of a dental X-ray, we find that a backscatter X-ray increases the odds of dying from cancer by about 16 ten millionths of one percent. That suggests that for every billion passengers screened with backscatter radiation, about 16 will die from cancer as a result.<p>Given that there will be 600 million airplane passengers per year, that makes the machines deadlier than the terrorists.<p>Nate Silver on the hidden cost of these new airport security measures:<p>According to the Cornell study, roughly 130 inconvenienced travelers died every three months as a result of additional traffic fatalities brought on by substituting ground transit for air transit. That's the equivalent of four fully-loaded Boeing 737s crashing each year.</i>",1290475475

For much of his life, he used these drugs to fuel his work– many of the Stones’ greatest songs were written during the peak of Richards’s drug use. He still drinks copiously and smokes marijuana and cigarettes. Drugs had caused a number of problems in his life– he’d suffered the death of a child and the drug-related deaths of several friends and band makes, but when heroin threatened his ability to make music, he was finally willing to quit.<p>Media accounts of drug problems rarely mention the power of life’s meaning and purpose over addiction. Regardless, research repeatedly finds that addicts in recovery do better when they have a sense of mission, a sense that what they do matters to others and is necessary. Without key sources of meaning and purpose- like children, relationships and productive work- addicts rarely stay clean. 12-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous give members a sense of meaning and purpose through spirituality or religion.<p>However, many rehab programs and addiction professionals deter those new to recovery to work. Due to those with addictive inclinations, those new to recovery can transfer their addiction onto work instead of focusing on building a strong foundation in recovery. Recently on CNN, in an interview regarding actor and frequent substance user Charlie Sheen, Dr. Drew said that it would be “impossible” for him to work and do rehab well at the same time. That’s a common belief in rehab: people are often told the should focus only on recovery and not on work or family or other “distractions,” when they’re trying to quit.<p>On the other hand, Keith Richards was able to work while quitting drugs and Lindsay Lohan, who is apparently permitted to work on her fashion line while recovering at the Betty Ford Center, can be beneficial to some. While its true that addicts must pay attention to learning skills the skills to avoid relapse, research finds that in the long term it’s much more important to foster the opportunity for meaningful work and close relationships. That way, even though you can’t get what you want, you’ll still have what you need.<p>As an alcoholic, addict, and full-time worker, I feel that keeping busy was beneficial to my recovery. Since boredom was a huge trigger, work allowed me to stay busy and keep my mind occupied. Some new to sobriety are not able to maintain a job due to their inability to maintain accountability or responsibility. With time, this will come. Luckily, since I was a high functioning alcoholic, I was able to jump back into society and continue to move forward.",1290474156

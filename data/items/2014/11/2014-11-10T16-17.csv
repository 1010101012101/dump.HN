8584648,comment,8583908,8584450,0,0,jonnathanson,,,"Hitler was willing to be opportunistically flexible with his definition of the &quot;Aryan race.&quot; For instance, he recognized Iranians, Arabs, and Turks as &quot;Aryans&quot;[1] in so far as they supported his war efforts. He also dubbed the Japanese &quot;Honorary Aryans,&quot; whatever that&#x27;s supposed to have meant. (Hirohito was about as fanatical over &quot;racial purity&quot; as Hitler was, and perhaps Hitler saw in him a kindred spirit, in addition to a military ally. Extant records and writings suggest that Hitler viewed the Japanese as more reliable allies than the Italians, whom he was planning to double-cross at some point down the road. This is probably because Italy shared a border with Hitler&#x27;s Germany, by way of Austria, and hence, was &quot;in the way,&quot; while Japan was not. Hitler&#x27;s writings and track record suggest that, had he won the war, he&#x27;d have turned on pretty much any country at any time, should they have proved inconvenient for any reason).<p>[1] Leaving aside the obvious, of course, which is that Iranians are arguably more &quot;Aryan&quot; than Middle-European Caucasians.

8584624,comment,8582793,8583728,0,0,opendais,,,"> What I would say is that there is a difference between hobby code where you get to do what you want and code where you didn&#x27;t control requirements and had to deliver to unreasonable people in unreasonable timeframes (aka commercial software development). Obviously it would depend on the projects but generally someone who has commercial experience would probably be viewed more favourably as it&#x27;s more directly comparable to what I need you to do.<p>1) If I can write a backend integration for some well known property (say, Amazon) as a hobby in Language X.<p>2) If I can show I can write backend integrations for some well known standard (say, EDI) in Language Y at my Day Job.<p>The idea I could write a backend integration for some API in Language X at a new job in situations where I don&#x27;t control the requirements, etc. is quite reasonable.<p>&quot;Commercial experience&quot; is really managing expectations and timelines to make it clear what you can/cannot do. It doesn&#x27;t magically make the choice of X vs. Y a significant difference if you are experienced enough in both to produce functional projects. Tbh, I&#x27;d be more worried about domain knowledge (How well does the programmer understand accounting?) than I would be about whether the programming language is X or Y is the one they use at their day job.<p>The quality of code isn&#x27;t going to massively change because a different language is used. You aren&#x27;t going to know the quality of code from their Day Job anyway, for all you know its unsustainable crap and they are trying to bail before their boss realizes it. At least with a hobby project you can check the basic boxes like &quot;Does this person like OOP vs. functional programming?&quot;.<p>The most that would change is how often the Dev would need to refer to the documentation and honestly, for anything that matters, that is going to happen alot anyway since no one wants to write something moving 5-6 figures a day worth of product without double checking everything first.<p>If you aren&#x27;t building something that handles that kind of value, the bar makes even less sense since you aren&#x27;t worried about them screwing up language specific edge cases that might cost you more than their paycheck if it goes unnoticed for an hour.<p>If anything, it seems to me this is testing for the absolute opposite of what you&#x27;d want to test for. Sure, it&#x27;ll work if the other measures are good...but communication ability + domain knowledge + ability to write code in Language X is what is required. Caring about whether or not Language X is or is not a hobby language...isn&#x27;t testing for anything relevant to the job if they&#x27;ve had programming jobs before.",1415638471

But what I&#x27;m saying is that this is an example of the games that job seekers have to play with different recruiters that have their own methods and agendas. It&#x27;s also possibly a difference between Europe and United States hiring methods, which could be a misunderstanding on my part.<p>But you&#x27;ve mentioned part of the problem, &quot;Recruiters don&#x27;t have the experience to know&quot;, therefore there is an issue with some recruiters being the gatekeepers. Especially when they state things that imply if you didn&#x27;t explain things in the magic way that they want to read it then they&#x27;ll pass on your resume. That&#x27;s my issue. It&#x27;s one thing to say &quot;please phrase your experience in simple terms for a non-technical person might be able to understand and can easily use as a basis for research&quot; as opposed to &quot;write it the way I like it or I may disregard&quot;. It&#x27;s not as bad as the guy who throws out resumes stating he doesn&#x27;t hire unlucky people, but it is a problem.<p>After all, if someone writes that they have AngularJS experience and the recruiter can&#x27;t be bothered to think &quot;I don&#x27;t know what that is, maybe I should look on Google&quot; then there&#x27;s a problem. I&#x27;m not saying that the recruiter in this thread is that person, but does seem to have something close to that mindset.<p>Which, I feel the need to point out, I&#x27;ve personally never had a bad experience with a recruiter nor hiring manager.

One interesting subtopic there is the internalization of the feeling of disgust. Elias shows how disgust -- which we often experience physiologically -- is a social construct that evolved through the ages.<p>Other than that, it is well accepted that some societies have built large, faceless institutions, and evolved from a face-to-face society to a society of strangers. It is a profound change, but no one claims that such a society is more rational than a face-to-face, let alone its members.

For example, I specifically avoided the word &#x27;flat&#x27;. There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with something being &#x27;flat&#x27;, and there are plenty of scenarios where one could quite easily argue in favour of a flat design over a &#x27;lickable&#x27; drop-shadowy visual feast.

Animation, depth, ui-as-content and so on. The topic is greater than the sum of it&#x27;s parts. I also feel that there are also no absolute right or wrongs and I didn&#x27;t want to kick off one of those sorts of debates stroke arguments. I suppose I&#x27;m not scrutinising the implementations but rather questioning the motives.<p>In addition, my comment was as much about &#x27;how we got here&#x27; rather than the problems with &#x27;where we&#x27;re at&#x27;, which I believe totally undermines the current state of UI design. For that, I don&#x27;t think there is much out there to support my view other than the history we&#x27;ve lived through, and we can each interpret that as we see fit. So that part you can take or leave. I offer it as an opinion.

It&#x27;s likely once-in-a-lifetime for the majority of them. You are going to give them a hands-on presentation detailing the value of free software and Linux, you will have their undivided attention for a week.<p>One problem: the organiser fell through with the chairs. There are unassembled ones ready to go, but the company who made those parts require that their guys assemble the chairs. You have some real smart fellas around that figured out how to assemble the chairs, only it&#x27;s not perfect and there&#x27;s a bit sticking into your butt.<p>So you start off the event with everyone standing their respective venues, no chairs in sight. You start off like this:<p>&quot;We had a problem with the chairs. If you don&#x27;t want to sit on the dirty floor you&#x27;ll need to use one of these chairs one of our guys put together.&quot; (Not telling them about the bit sticking into their butt, which you don&#x27;t)<p>&quot;We can get the manufacturer to build the chairs for you, however, because we don&#x27;t know how they did it we don&#x27;t know if the chairs will break. If it breaks you could snap your spine, turning you into a paraplegic.&quot;<p>&quot;Or you could remain standing, or sit on the floor.&quot;<p>How many people will walk out right there and then? Would you?<p>Some people, who no have reason to trust you over the manufacturer (keep that in mind), might use the ones your guys made. After a day sitting with a pokey bit in your butt, what would you do?<p>If you had a fully functional chair how long would you stick around for? Who provided that chair?<p>What have you just done to your potential audience?<p>The message is important, maybe one day people will understand but never if this hardline approach is maintained.<p>An honest appraisal of each option is needed for users, <i></i>up-front<i></i> during the installation process. They must not go in search of it:<p>- Open source drivers: poor performance, very stable, likely to not crash.<p>- Proprietary drivers: high performance, we don&#x27;t know if you should trust them, if something goes wrong there is nothing we can do.<p>> Change always comes bearing gifts. ~Price Pritchett",1415638270

8584539,comment,8583722,8584168,0,0,zanny,,,"> Why would an ISP bother building out the infrastructure if they can&#x27;t extract a higher value from those that it most benefits (Netflix)?<p>Netflix is not getting the benefit, the end user is. That is the demand side of things. They can and do charge more for higher bandwidth, and Netflix will require more than the national average to reliably stream at 1080p. Netflix only exists to fill that need, and the ISP exists to fill that users bandwidth need. It is not Netflix&#x27;s direct need.<p>> it must be mutually beneficial for both parties to go along.<p>It is. Netflix makes more profit off working Internet from Comcast than they lose paying the bribe. But <i>we</i> lose, the consumers, because Netflix is getting a fast lane now, and sets a precedent that ISPs can hold ransom their bandwidth from anyone.<p>> I think this fear is overblown, although I could be wrong.<p>It takes no effort on their part to set up their routing to have <i>everyone</i> in a slow lane unless you pay the fee, and they have no motivation not to, because when smaller websites are slow, users stop visiting them, they don&#x27;t drop their ISP over it.<p>> Why should those consumers be subsidizing those that use broadband heavy services?<p>They should not / aren&#x27;t. At least in terms of month to month server upkeep. In terms of infrastructure wire, you pay the same taxes that maintain the roads if you drive a hundred miles a year as the guy who drives ten thousand miles a month. Previous models have showed that the overhead of calculating physical infrastructure usage (ie, power) is hard, and unless the per-unit volume is valuable enough it is not worth the bureaucracy.<p>> Why should Netflix not be allowed to help subsidize the cost of providing broadband? Why should this fall solely on the individual?<p>Because they are not subsidizing at all. End user will pay the same for Internet regardless of how much money content providers throw at ISPs because the vast majority are in monopoly positions and can do whatever they want up until the point users just drop service all together.<p>> I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s a better scenario than currently exists.<p>If it were the case that ISPs were the underdog here, because compelled by legislation to spend their private earnings to build cable that they cannot dictate price on and must lease compulsively, then you would have an argument.<p>But current ISPs have the opposite. They inherited their infrastructure from public works and other telecom companies, where the laying of cable was heavily subsidized by taxpayer money, and in some cases (verizon) they were <i>given money</i> to invest in infrastructure that they then ran away with and faced no consequences.<p>>  decrease the barriers it takes to compete.<p>There are only three ways to do this.<p>One, you have &quot;wire lanes&quot; where anyone can run wire across the nation. This means starting an ISP no longer has the insurmountable mountain of regulation surrounding breaking ground, and you can just buy fiber, run it, and hook up each end user that wants it on an individual basis from the street corner.<p>The downside is you end up with tons of redundant infrastructure investments, and wire itself is mad pricey. This means that the industry as a whole is inefficient, due to the redundancy. The good news would be that with laying cable being an actual option, entrenched players would have a motivation to lease what they have at reasonable rates to avoid someone else investing heavily in competing in the infrastructure.<p>But it is also completely infeasible. There is no way to set up New York City or rural Arkansas in a way to just let anyone lay fiber cable. The investment alone in getting to that point vastly eclipses the costs of just laying a public fiber channel owned the state that anyone can hook up to.<p>Option two is compulsory leasing, which is what Title 2 is in effect. If nobody can lay wire and actually compete with entrenched interests, you cannot have price competition on the rental rates of wire in the ground. So you have to use legislation to force it.<p>Option three is either eminent domain of the telecommunications infrastructure or the build out of a publicly maintained fiber network. It could emulate the power companies, where regional switching stations are mandated to maintain the network within their jurisdiction using funds from acting as a private ISP, and the networks just need to be interconnected by mandate. This means that the wire is effectively free to use, and you just have to hook in servers and provide bandwidth.<p>The problem there is that you need junction points where you connect to the backbone, and adding one to an already established network is on the order of complexity as laying wire itself. So it is either that, or wholly public ISPs with taxpayer funded Internet service.<p>The downside to that is that you can look at <i>all</i> public infrastructure in the US and see how well that went given our current organization of government. The roads in many states are decrepit, the power grid is woefully in need of an upgrade, water services all over the place are being sold off privately and are also in deteriorating condition, and at least pedestrian rail is on the brink of death (no idea about commercial rail, but the prevalence of trucks in the PA area tells me it is not doing too well either). Our local, state, <i>and</i> federal government have collectively and decisively shown that given the political leanings and organization of state we in the US have, that none of them can maintain infrastructure, let alone improve it in the way we desperately need our Internet infrastructure <i>improved</i> over time, not just kept in its current state.",1415637606

It seems like every vote with approval voting is a strategic vote, whereas with IRV you just always vote for your preferred candidates in order.<p>Yes, favorite betrayal is possible, but it requires a very specific set of circumstances, and the only gaming of the system is people throwing their top vote to the opponent, which is very risky and requires a freakish amount of insight into the race to know if the conditions of a spoiler are even possible.<p>To me, strategic voting seems much more likely with approval voting than it does with IRV, and it&#x27;s that strategic voting that is maintaining the two party system. I think the possibility of a possible spoiler effect under IRV is small, and that its chances of actually allowing 3rd party victories are much higher, and thus worth the risk, especially because, to me, approval voting doesn&#x27;t really remove the spoiler effect, but just delays it.<p>I like approval voting, but IRV seems like a better solution, overall.<p>Also, I disagree that approval voting is much easier to understand.

8584532,comment,8583722,8584466,0,0,warfangle,,,"> An explicit ban on paid prioritization is the only way to preserve the system we have today<p>Errr... no, it won&#x27;t preserve the system. Because the system right now, at least at the interconnect level, already has paid prioritization. See: the interconnect fight vis a vis NFLX, Level 3, Verizon.<p>> The goal with this move is to AVOID common carriers and AVOID competition.<p>Not sure where you&#x27;re getting the competition thing, but it&#x27;s absolutely not about avoiding common carriers. Title II is very, very specifically a common carrier.<p>> Our cable lobbyists and therefore our government will do anything to avoid common carrier legislation being passed.<p>No need for legislation; just a reclassification. No legislation needed for that.<p>> Banning paid prioritization will do nothing to address the actual problems with American ISPs.<p>Nothing? It&#x27;ll do something. It&#x27;s a step in the right direction. One of the requirements under Title II has to do specifically with interconnection: this bullshit between Verizon and Level 3 and NFLX would be patently illegal.<p>> Common carriers would not be allowed to control the content on their wires at all -- they would be forced to let ISPs purchase bandwidth and compete on the same wire. Granting wire ownership and content control to one company is a natural monopoly: In almost every locale new ISPs cannot use the wires someone else owns, new ISPs cannot dig trenches for new wires, and new ISPs have no common wires to offer service on. Therefore, no new ISPs can form under normal conditions, and competition cannot exist. The only logical conclusion is that we are being denied a free market, on purpose.<p>I think you&#x27;re kind of missing the point of what common carriers actually are. You&#x27;re hitting some things, but completely missing on others.<p>Nobody is calling for granting wire ownership to a single entity.

If you allow paid prioritization, there will no longer be a &quot;vibrant&quot; tech sector (as we think of it today) in the US. If you <i>only</i> ban paid prioritization, ISPs will continue to hold monopolies, price-fix, offer inferior service, not invest in their infrastructure, and fuck over their customers with fraudulent charges. But, hey, Netflix will stay in business, so all&#x27;s well, right?!<p>The goal with this move is to AVOID common carriers and AVOID competition. Paid prioritization is a minor symptom of the problem that ISPs are not common carriers. I say this because without common carriers, <i>if the only ISP has paid prioritization, a there is no competitor to switch to</i>. Banning paid prioritization will do nothing to address the <i>actual problems</i> with American ISPs. Our cable lobbyists and therefore our government will do anything to avoid common carrier legislation being passed.<p>Common carriers would not be allowed to control the content on their wires at all -- they would be forced to let ISPs purchase bandwidth and compete on the same wire. Granting wire ownership and content control to one company is a natural monopoly: In almost every locale new ISPs cannot use the wires someone else owns, new ISPs cannot dig trenches for new wires, and new ISPs have no common wires to offer service on. Therefore, no new ISPs can form under normal conditions, and competition cannot exist. The only logical conclusion is that we are being denied a free market, on purpose.",1415637008

This whole net neutrality debate has been going on long before Obama started his first term of presidency, why wait until you are almost out of the White House to act upon something as important as this? He has had six years to act on this. Could it perhaps have anything to do with the fact the Democrats took a heavy blow recently with Republicans being popular with the voters in the recent election? Is Obama merely trying to save some face with the voters for his party to mitigate risk at the next presidential election?<p>Maybe, maybe not. It probably is not fair of me to try and make connections to speculative thoughts like that. I am passionate about net neutrality and it just feels weird Obama is going public on a subject like this not long after votes were casted.<p>But you know what? Either way, if Obama can get a bill deeming internet to be classified as a utility within the next two years, maybe he will leave behind a legacy that we talk of in the years to come. It might be six years too late, but if anyone can make something like this happen, it is the president.<p>I am aware that the FCC can change things without any bills needing to be passed and while I am speculating here, the FCC is not exactly known for being honest and transparent. An independent agency with some suspicious ties to lobbyists and corporations trying to protect their monopolies like Comcast. The issue here is the FCC can change things and should change things but ultimately will not change a thing unless the pressure is there from the right hands. Obama speaking up is great, do not get me wrong, but I think the likes of the FCC will need more than gentle words to start changing things. Action needs to be taken.<p>I simply refuse to believe that an agency can run itself to the point where it controls what can and cannot happen with something as important as the internet which in my opinion is a basic human right to have access to.",1415636596

If you are arrested and charged with a crime, then they can inspect the photos as evidence, but not before. They still are not permitted to delete any.<p>My understanding is different for the UK. If you refuse to show a police officer the photos, they have the right to take you to a station, where they will examine the photos. Like you, i&#x27;m not a lawyer.<p>>Also, in the UK if someone who is not a police office tries to detain you (and this includes security guards and PCSOs), then they must be relying on the law of citizen&#x27;s arrest, which means that they must have seen you in the act of committing an offense that could be tried at a crown court - in other words, something worthy of half a year or more in prison.<p>What you say is true about the citizens arrest, but as was mentioned in the article, my understanding was that they are able to call the police because you&#x27;ve been acting suspiciously, and that they have that &#x27;right&#x27; to call the police if you are seen taking photos. They can&#x27;t hold you, but then most people stay, because leaving is seen as an admission of guilt/being a terrorist. Would be nice if this was tested in a court of law, or to hear from someone who knows if it has. Even then i&#x27;m not convinced a Judge won&#x27;t just say &quot;Well, in this post 9/11 time, people should be expected to be stopped if they take photos of high value targets.&quot;<p>EDIT: Taking photos of a building == Acting suspiciously.

Getting in fights outside of bars at 3am is disturbing the peace. IE, people don&#x27;t feel safe when that is common.  When police show up, most everyone is drunk, angry, scared, etc. They don&#x27;t know what happened. Sometimes they can work it out from talking to people but a 4 minute investigation and witness statements from a bunch of drunks is not all that reliable. They need to do something to keep the peace. So, they might arrest all involved or some or sternly send them all home. Video solves that problem. They know how done it.<p>On the philosophical note, I think outcomes are important. Prison systems producing 80% re-offence are a failure. That said, I also believe in justice. I want rapists, murderers and assailants to go to jail regardless of harm reduction or rehabilitation.

I can live with that.<p>So how would a 14 year old wanting to play games on Linux see this? Firstly, he&#x27;d install a game such as Borderlands and try it out. He hits a wall with dreadful framerate. One of two things, he goes back to a pirated copy of Windows (most likely) or somehow finds out he needs the vendor kernel module:<p>He pulls down the compiler tools, which could take up to an hour in 3rd world countries (first-hand experience). He then goes through the process of changing the init level to 2, compiling the driver shim and installing it. He then reboots his PC and XOrg crashes. Back to Windows or...<p>He discovers the Ubuntu automatic installer. Excellent! Just a few clicks and... &quot;non-free?&quot; Does this mean I have to pay for it? Will I need my parents&#x27; credit card? Why is there a warning sign? Am I doing something wrong?

Two guys forced it from me with one pointing a knife at me and ran away. Three levels up through hallways full of cameras. I waited for an additional ~20mins (collecting information from bystanders). Nobody appeared. Not even the police one of the bystanders called...<p>The situation we have here is exactly what the CCC and all the anti-surveillance movements said when the hype for cameras all over began. They said back than that we&#x27;ll have less police and security on the streets and we&#x27;ll lose the control of the data recorded there.<p>Today even the smallest bus company has cameras in their bus. Even if they can&#x27;t afford to clean the bus properly. Open drug market places have been moved to shady side roads where crime rose. Videos of people being beat up in front of cameras became popular and seem to become popular until media stopped reporting and playing the videos.  And so on.<p>I don&#x27;t see the whole thing work out. Cameras create a false security hole that allows to cut down money where it would have been better invested: in police officers on the streets. What happens to all the collected data, I don&#x27;t even want to know anymore. Btw I&#x27;ve heard a polish city is recording audio also. Isn&#x27;t it nice? They even prevented some crime with it...<p>Btw. the Police was unable to get the videos from my robbery. &quot;Technical reasons&quot;.",1415635282

336479,comment,336367,336431,0,0,davidw,,,"Oh, also, what's interesting about this whole business is that PG is actually continuing to put his own money on the line as if nothing had changed, and will presumably be able to gather some real data from how the YC startups fare in the next year or two, rather than simply writing about it.  Ted bailed on his startup before the economy even really got bad, and has apparently gone back to writing nasty things about other people, which, compared to risking your money and mentoring people, is pretty easy.",1224344522

The article has it completely backwards - the airport security theater is what creates the false feeling of unsafety.",1224344511
336477,comment,334355,335216,0,0,Bananadine,,,"I feel this way as well--except I think I'm what he calls a ""hacker"", and as someone mentions above, I only like making money--so far in my professional career, anyway--because it represents freedom to work on stuff I care about, in some sense.  Usually people call this ""time""; if you have the money to keep yourself alive without working constantly on things you don't care about, then you have time for things you care about.  I think of it as something more like ""energy"" myself, since even when I don't have a paying job at all (and thus have lots and lots of time), I still can only stand working in a few fairly short, intense bursts per day, due to the rise and fall of my inspiration and fatigue and so forth.<p>But back onto Mr. Graham:  Since I'm a ""hacker"", I already know a lot of stuff he knows about software development, and in fact it's clear that I also know a lot that he doesn't address in his essays and probably isn't even aware of.  I mean, I'm a video game developer who writes in Java on Windows machines, and I've got good reason to be such.  Why should I pay attention to Mr. Lisp here who scorns Windows and has never used Java, and who doesn't even mention playing games, let alone programming them?*  I'm sure I could learn some things from him, but he is ignorant of my world, however much he may know about his own kind of software development.<p>He is far from ignorant, however, about startups.  And he's got interesting things to say about various other, non-technical subjects too.  So let him talk about those!<p>* I suspect there are plenty of Mac fans and Lisp fans and C++ fans among this site's readers who could snappily answer this question.  I do not have time to armor this comment against techie criticism; that would itself require an essay.  Suffice to say that I claim I could if I wanted to.  :)",1224344299

It'd be one thing if it was funny, or actually picked holes in pg's arguments, but it's not much better than the average youtube comment.<p>""Ah, yes. It's a crying shame that your landlord won't accept an explanation of your idea in lieu of rent.

It's at times like this where people are tested and those that don't have it, fail. Which is why I guess he quit pressflip. This is just bitter rambling really.",1224343617

I figured he's not the kind of person to take this gracefully, and his resumption of uncov is exactly what I'm talking about.<p>The thing that's really rich is that if uncov had been active at the time, they would have torn pressflip several new orifices because they were doing a lot of things wrong.<p>It's pretty hardcore hypocritical to admit you don't have the stones for the fight and then go back to making fun of people who do. No matter how bad their code is, at least they're not quitters.",1224343575

You could say that the stock market bubble of 2000 lead to the low interest rates, but it's not true. Money supply has sharply increased in the US since the 1980s. Now it's payback time for a few years I'm afraid.",1224342703

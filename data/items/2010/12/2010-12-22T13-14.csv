A HN comment from today[1] brought the problem to my mind again, but this time with a possible solution.<p>At their roots, operant conditioning and classical conditioning are both learning mechanisms.  Since the time of operant conditioning, spaced repetition[2] has gained a lot of popularity. It's a further refinement that depends on beginning with short intervals, and proceeding to longer ones.<p>The idea this suggests to me is that speeding tickets happen to many people infrequently enough that the enhanced learning never takes place.  Draconian crackdowns, however, happen frequently and with high salience because of media coverage--the only time you know about someone else getting a speeding ticket is when you see them pulled over, and it's hard to feel as personally involved with that as when you hear all the details of someone's arrest and imprisonment on the news.<p>One piece of evidence for media coverage changing behavior is that people buy lottery tickets; because they've seen lottery winners on the news, the probability of winning has a much higher salience than it deserves.<p>[1]<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2030038"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2030038</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition</a>",1293025429

The OP was (IMO) correct - a product's success, when done by a private company, is whether or not it improves the company's bottom line.  I don't think that that claim can be made about Chrome or Android at the moment.  I certainly doubt whether the little money they are currently making out of Android would not be largely blown aware by another allocation of that energy and resources.<p>That's not to say that in the long term these products don't end up being major successes, but until they start making money, that claim can't be made.",1293024415

Today, I just opened the notepad and started typing away what I felt. The idea to do so seemed a little funny at first as my thoughts were very clear in my mind and it was my helplessness to do anything that had got me down, but trust me, it helped tremendously. After so many days, I did some meaningful work, of course nothing compared to my peak days but it did break the ""cant-do-anything"" streak. I have also been feeling better overall after writing.
Just thought would share this with you all. Happy holidays.",1293024342

For the first two weeks she was too afraid to make a sound other than the high pitched nasal whining.<p>The first day she barked was hilarious, because she ran and hid from herself. We got her confidence up by encouraging her to do stupid stuff, like walking along our legs from the ottoman onto our laps or sitting on the back of the couch. She's now taken to doing laps of my head making occasional lick attacks.<p>We took to putting booties on her because of all the salt the city puts on the sidewalks. We don't want it getting into cracks in her feet on longer walks (on short walks she lives in the snow tracking like a hound), plus she plays amateur dramatics when her paws get cold. Seeing her in the booties is hilarious as she doesn't seem to feel the ground (I guess its the permanent pressure on her pads) so she's walking like space dog making super exaggerated steps (I swear she's doing a John Cleese Hitler walk parody) and having her out for walks is awesome. She spends the entire walk running like crazy, but she's stuck at my pace as she only has marginal traction.",1293023625

For fifteen minutes the Long Beach Police watched Douglas Zerby sitting on an interior courtyard stoop playing with a toy gun. They never announced their presence. There was no danger to anyone. They never announced their presence. There were at least five police officers there. Then, after fifteen minutes, two or three of them opened fire with shotguns and pistols. There was no warning, and no command to drop the weapon. Apparently his first notification that the police were present was to be shot dead.<p>This, according to the LBPD, was to protect the citizens and make certain no one got hurt.<p>Heroic.

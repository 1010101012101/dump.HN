Many, perhaps most, don't even have a serious alternative theory, they're just pointing out what they think is wrong with AGW.<p>The important exceptions are:<p>As far as I know, the computer models that predict serious AGW just don't work.  They don't ""predict the past"", i.e. you feed them historical data and they don't then predict what actually happened, and now that we can test their predictions they aren't working either.  E.g.:<p>""<i>The fact is that we can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can’t. The CERES data published in the August BAMS 09 supplement on 2008 shows there should be even more warming: but the data are surely wrong.</i>"" <a href=""http://www.eastangliaemails.com/emails.php?eid=1048&filename=1255352257.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eastangliaemails.com/emails.php?eid=1048&file...</a><p>ESR comments (<a href=""http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=1473"" rel=""nofollow"">http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=1473</a>): ""<i>Eyebrows have quite rightly been raised over this quote. It is indeed a travesty that AGW theory cannot account for the lack of warming, and bears out what I and other AGW critics have been saying for years about the fallaciousness and lack of predictive power of AGW models.<p>""But the second sentence is actually far more damning. “The data is surely wrong.” This is how and where most scientific fraud begins.</i>""<p>And that brings us to the second big issue, how good is the data and based on that what can it be used for.  The proxies are very iffy, especially when they get out of the historical period and can be compared to fairly solid actual temperature measurements (""hide the decline"" of the tree ring proxies).<p>Then there's the questions of older thermometers, where researchers are trying to tease fractional degrees out of instruments with hand painted lines.  That goes many times over for the proxies.<p>And the problem with badly situated ground monitoring stations, especially the urban heat island problem.<p>Then there's the demonstrated poor to impossible quality of the CRU data and their loss of the original data; as the detailed in the HARRY_READ_ME.txt file (<a href=""http://www.anenglishmanscastle.com/HARRY_READ_ME.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anenglishmanscastle.com/HARRY_READ_ME.txt</a>), they can't even reproduce their own massaging of the original data....<p>And as I understand it, the NASA satellite data has been calibrated against these poor ground station data sets, not e.g. weather balloons, but I could be wrong there.  This is important since instruments can drift over time, and when they're in an inaccessible satellite....<p>This just hits the highlights of the problems with the data, before we get into a whole lot of what looks like at worst case outright fraud.<p>These things including fraud don't throw climate science per se into doubt as a discipline, but they do engender skepticism and denial of AGW, which as noted is another thing altogether.<p>Anyway, I'll repeat the call many people are making: open it up.  Retrieve the original lost records, do the science in the open, publishing all methods, code and data, and let the chips fall where they may.<p>When an author of a published ""science"" paper refuses to share his raw data, methods and code (and we're not talking about e.g. chemistry/chemical engineering where there's competitive advantage on the table for chemical companies), people legitimately wonder and discount what he says.  When scientists give ""the dog ate my homework"" excuses, you might believe them about that (I think it's very possible WRT to the CRU ... but it says something that they didn't consider it important to archive it carefully), but I don't see how you're obliged to treat their unconfirmable results with any respect.<p>Add the bad faith that's manifest in the CRU emails....",1272030339

The netbook has served me well, it’s fast and the battery life is fine (4 hours).<p>Later, I have decided to learn some jQuery and JavaScript in my spare time (so in my netbook). I installed Expression Studio (Web 3.0), Stylizer, FireFox, FireBug and Google Chrome. When working (debugging JavaScript or editing HTML) I always keep all of the windows open (Web 3, Firefox, Chrome, Stylizer and sometimes IE8 for testing); the speed is amazing, it never slowed me down. I also run Skype and Gtalk.<p>The only issue I have been facing is Flash and mainly with FaceBook videos which completely slow down, kill and then crash Google Chrome or any other browser which was positive since it increased my productivity. Another issue was with Adobe Reader, very slow at loading, opening and browsing PDF books or files.",1272030222

I can't answer for this other guy. His reasons are his own.<p>The problem with spending so much time optimizing an artificial mathematical model (game) is that less work and time is required to create the model than to optimize it. Therefore (to me), it's the losers than spend time working on other people's problems that never move up to the next level: being creative. It's just a mechanical process. (and yes, I'm aware that some creativity is involved in the optimization)<p>My value system is in creating something for other people. So creativity and value to others, are the metric I use when allocating my time. I guess if such a electronic work could benefit people -- by making them happy for a bit or providing them with information they needed or something, it would be worthwhile. I mean heck, under my value system you can stretch a lot of things to make them work. The question (for me) is whether or not those 3 years could have been better spent.<p>Yes, at the end it's all gone anyway. That doesn't mean piss away your life. If anything, it means you only have a certain amount of time to do things you find valuable.<p>My opinion only. To each his own.",1272029146

Watching the videos, you realize someone perfectly reversed the algorithm that makes Sim City 3000 run.  Through trial and error this guy beat the system.  I think it takes a lot of intuition to get this completed.<p>Granted, from a purely logical viewpoint this city wouldn't work, but that's not the challenge.  The challenge was to beat Sim City 3000 and he did that.  Think of it as trying to get the highest score in Pac Man or Super Mario Brothers.  There are competitions on that!  And from one screenshot from the videos, it seems as though there are competitions for Sim City 3000 too.<p>Yes this city wouldn't work in real life.

I try to keep a degree of separation between work and home, and I believe most do the same (though ""home"" can be the laptop I bring with me to work) - I don't use my work PC for downloading porn or dating - I do use it for personal email or some kinds of ""socialization"" like HN.",1272028449

I've grown to the point where I can give someone a promise, and not have to worry about whether or not I'll follow through.

Why make the markup language visible to users? I think that you should hide it behind a user friendly WYSIWYG interface, like google docs (bold, italic, lists, etc.).<p>You can then use git or git-like processes behind the scenes and reprocess the result not to show markup to the user. I think that markup for non tech users is a bad experience and diffs with markup in them are even worse.",1284371874

1686057,comment,1684791,1685608,0,0,osdf,,,"I like your comment. You probably are not German, but if, you would like the texts of Reinhard Kahl (<a href=""http://reinhardkahl.de/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reinhardkahl.de/</a>). His texts are basically about the question 'What kind of school works', and actually 'What do we mean by ""school works""'. Among others he tried hard to demystifiying the success of the finnish school system in the first PISA test, argueing against just copying blindly some aspects that _seemed_ important (e.g. like you, he pointed out that 'education' was socially highly respected in Finnland, unlike in most other european countries). He constantly writes about (german) schools that achieve very good results in tests like PISA, highlighting what they do differently. It is quite interesting that he often finds methods or techniques in these schools that fit really well a lot of findings in neuroscience and psychology (without the teachers at these school knowing anything about these findings!). So what are some things he advocates: (i) no longer teach in a fixed classroom setting, instead, every student should learn by himself, according to weekly/monthly/yearly plans that are setup together with his teacher(s) [main reason for this: every human is special, our brains do not develop at the same speed at the same time] (ii) do not kill the researcher in the children, instead foster playfulness in live and study and show that effort is something deeply satisfying (iii) Authentic teachers, authentic parents, authentic grown-ups (iv) Bring the 'real' live/world into the school (vi) open the school up to the 'real' live, schools should be centers in our society, (vii) at school you don't teach subjects, you teach human beings (viii) there is no school to rule them all and many more aspects. I like his stuff so much because he shows and describes places that really work, and also manages to write about philosophical aspects of these questions (he often connects to writings from Hannah Arendt about eduction).<p>PS: I'm aware that I can't give justice to the stuff Kahl writes, what I have written is quite incomplete. But one has to read it on its own. I'm also aware that some of this stuff is only relevant for german schools, yet I think the broader questions is relevant for all countries.<p>PPS: Refrain from calling me a hippy, a dreamer, a communist or any other stereotype _you_ think is negative. I went through the normal (german) school and university system and it gradually became clear to me, that things as they were and are working are not as good as we want to think, actually, things are rather bad. I'm looking for new ways and possible solutions, trying to find the right questions.",1284371365

In 1995 there were three commercial applications: network simulator, mobility server and distributed resource controller. First is a simulator, not running on the specialized hardware, the third was running on ""a network of Windows NT machines."" The second: ""acts as a call control system <i>when linked to the PBX</i>""<p>OK, the second was running on the additional SPARC-based machine, not big iron, but AFAIK certainly more powerful than the PC's of that time.<p>So I don't see anything that was targeting really ""specialized hardware"" particularly  not what we'd think as embedded (less power consumption, slower processors than the PC CPU's). It was a research project, and it had traditionally performance problems.<p>Even today, after so many years, when you compare Erlang HiPe (Hi Perf, you can imagine others then!) with something higher than C, let's then say Lua JIT it's easy to see which one is faster:<p><a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=hipe&lang2=luajit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all...</a><p>Edit: Or for multi core 64 bits with Mono:<p><a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=hipe&lang2=csharp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/benchmark.php?test=al...</a>",1284369298

If I regret anything, it is not joining earlier.<p>It is great fun, and there is a lot in terms of social skills, working in groups, and fulfilling roles, that you will learn along the way. Don't worry about making a fool of yourself, because as long as you do it with a smile (and say sorry where due), people will like you for it :-) Drinking before you do this will also help :-)<p>And about making your pick: I'd go for a smaller one (~ 200 members), that you feel at home at. The people there will most likely be more diverse and welcoming.<p>I went through a (moderate) hazing, and even that is not too bad, as long as you remember that it is a game, and that it will only last for a specific amount of time.

That's a huge overall win.<p>Complexity in itself isn't actually that bad.  It's <i>arbitrary</i> complexity that spawns all those post-its.  You can come up with a strong password that you and only you can remember, but it's useless if your bank rejects it due to its own silly complexity policy.  There are sites out there that I regularly fail to log in with using my standard ""strong"" passwords, and it's not until I make it all the way through the Reset Password process to where it tells me its complexity requirement that I'm reminded which password I must have used last time I went through the process.<p>The only real solution is to let people use the word ""password"" if they really want.

Ironic that it is these two parties that are currently sharing power in the UK, yet they have polarise stances on something fundamental to future trade, innovation, and growth.<p>More interesting are the smaller parties and independents.

However, no matter how you make the metric, this problem is largely psychological.<p>To do well, a student must be motivated to learn. And one of the biggest motivators at this level is that ""I always am at the top of my class in this subject, so I enjoy it."" Not everyone can be at the top, so naturally the others won't care as much. They will stop trying to get an A and settle with ""not failing."" And the students who start failing will stop caring completely.<p>If you hide a student's ranking, then that initial motivation, ""I do better than the others,"" disappears and we are left with students who must be entirely self motivated.

And, no don't wait.. the harder your course load gets, the more excuses you'll make.<p>Some of my best friends today are guys I never would have met (or probably even liked, for that matter) without having shared the whole fraternity experience. And, I'm talking about the ""boring"" stuff when I say frat experience. Working on projects, figuring out creative ways to get 60+ guys to do something they didn't want to do, volunteering, etc., etc.<p>It's just like anything else, it's what you make of it, and what your trying to get out of it.  I saw guys who were really good at all the social stuff, but never took a thing from the overall bigger experience and just kind of faded out.  I also saw people who came in without all that (very shy, didn't know how to play games or whatever).  They wanted to grow as a person, and gain experience being apart of a team, build leadership skills, and what not, they could and really did thrive, and became just amazing leaders later on.<p>To answer your questions though: Don't worry about it, and just be yourself! My fraternity would invite people over to hang out a few times or go watch some game or something before ever even talking about parties. This was a way to weed out people only interested in that. Not everyone just gets a bid to keep the organization alive like a few posters mentioned.<p>For your situation, (which isn't unusual, and probably everyone else is also worried about it) this would be an awesome time for you to ""get in"" and get to know guys in a non-party setting. Get to know people like that, and the social part will just fall into place. You'll be hanging out with new friends rather than being worried about being in a big crowd or drinking or whatever.<p>You got a lot of advice, so I won't go on.  I do have things I didn't really like as well but overall it was a really great experience.  E-mail me if you want more, there's a pretty good movie I can recommend that is the most ""right on"" portrayal of Greek life, and the lead character is some guy without any social skills who is concerned about the same things you are.

However, always, always, be trying to figure out a way to bring it up in conversations with girls..)",1284368533

8064588,comment,8064231,8064440,2,0,lovelettr,,,"When you start looking into the relationship between Cogent and Level 3. One starts to wonder if all this is not a straw-man argument anyways. It seems to me that both Cogent and Level 3 are both united in their stance against Verizon regarding these sorts of tactics [1].<p>There are some interesting points in that Ars article that I think are worth noting. For one, what is being discussed in that article is case in point what Verizon is admitting they are doing. They have the head-room to handle the bandwidth that Cogent and Level 3 could send in their direction [2]. However are specifically not adding any more interconnections and asking for someone to pay for more interconnections. Sounds like a &quot;toll&quot; to me.<p>The other point that is interesting to me is in some of the debate about net neutrality people specifically state that what they what is for ISPs to not purposely throttle traffic on their network. However, this tactic seems to be the loop-hole in that request. Meaning if Verizon never properly peers with Level 3 then they have no reason to throttle the Level 3 traffic. It is already made scarce, and throttled, by the arbitrary scarcity of the limited traffic that is allowed through the peers. Thus Verizon and all ISPs can adhere to the letter of the law. While probably ignoring the spirit of it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/03/level-3-and-cogent-ask-fcc-for-protection-against-isp-tolls/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/03/level-3-and-cogent-a...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://publicpolicy.verizon.com/blog/entry/why-is-netflix-buffering-dispelling-the-congestion-myth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publicpolicy.verizon.com/blog/entry/why-is-netflix-bu...</a>",1405961654

Aside from mathematics and logic exersizes, there&#x27;s no discussion that doesn&#x27;t involve persuassion and arguments about the very premises (and on multiple levels).<p>That&#x27;s one of the reasons that the pure mechanistic check of the operations/conclusion part that logical fallacies provide is very nearly useless.<p>And of course the &quot;checking the premises&quot; part is not mechanistic (that another problem with the formal check), and could also go ad-infinitum.

This can happen if the needs of the company/founders and VCs don&#x27;t align. For instance the early VCs want to get out because they prefer to invest in quick hits and don&#x27;t want to keep their attention on the company for the long-term, so they sell the stock to someone that&#x27;s willing to take years (and the resultant risk) for a pay out.\n3) The founders or the company itself buys out the VCs. Typically this would happen for situations where there&#x27;s a different vision for the company, for instance the founders want to turn it into a lifestyle business, or a case like #2 where the VCs are losing patience. If the company buys the shares, it has them to distributed to new employees or to limit the number of outstanding shares and therefore increase the price per share.",1405961450

There are a bunch of extra checks all over the place along with a profiler [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/perf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/perf.html</a><p>* Speed isn&#x27;t the top priority of the framework, predictability is. There&#x27;s a virtual event infrastructure and other browser normalization work going on. Om is using React under the hood and more or less represents the best case scenario.<p>* React isn&#x27;t magically fast. The diff process still has to visit all the nodes in the virtual DOM, generate the edit list, and apply it, which is a substantial amount of overhead. I&#x27;m used to seeing React even or behind when benchmarked with a small number of nodes. The explanation I&#x27;ve seen is that these benchmarks aren&#x27;t considered important since the goal isn&#x27;t to be as fast as possible but rather to never be slower than 16ms.<p>The trick behind most of the &quot;React is fast&quot; articles is that React is O(N_dom) instead of O(N_model) so if you can shrink the size of the output DOM, React goes faster. The Om line demonstrates this and doing screen-sized render over a sliding window of data in a huge data set (most grid/scrolling list demos) is another common example. There are perf knobs that probably aren&#x27;t being turned here but if the app renders fast enough why would you waste your time turning them?",1405961212

8064515,comment,8060347,8063047,1,0,bitexploder,,,"Here is the thing. Stoicism as it was taught 2000 years ago was extremely bound up in its &quot;providential&quot; and deity focus. Not as unpalatable as some of the more direct monotheistic religions, but depending on your teacher stoicism was still on a scale of pantheism to direct theism. (Marcus was very pantheistic and deemphasized religion, Epictetus was much more vocal about the theistic elements). As a modern reader a lot of ancient philosophy is like that. It has elements that you have to excise. So ancient philosophies are not really plug in play for a modern rationalist.<p>Basically, I think you have to start by writing things down and learning about the elements of these ancient, and modern, philosophies to see the sort of systems they put in place to deal with every day life events and exceptional events. How should I think about X? And some very obvious patterns will emerge. Some elements of stoicism may be difficult to employ and Stoicism in general is a hard to follow (fully) philosophy. The key point Epictetus had was that very few of us have the ability to follow Stoicism (or any coherent, but challenging) philosophy to its fullest. However, we should still endeavor down this path of &quot;progress&quot;. This is why Epictetus has stayed so popular. He didn&#x27;t advocate perfection of philosophy, merely that you work at it.<p>Which brings me to my final thought for you to answer your question directly: write it all down. For example, Stoicism has a lot of great elements that resemble modern psychology CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). So you pull the elements of ancient philosophies that work, you augment it with snippets like this Less Wrong articles various things. And you write your own coherent philosophy of life. And then you work at following it. It is pretty easy to lay down ideals, and pretty hard to stick to them. So you have to work at it, almost every day. You have to work on mindfulness and staying present and ensuring you keep your philosophy in mind in every day situations and exceptional situations. And, and this is where it gets tricky if you have trouble with non-empirical elements, you just have to believe your philosophy works. You have to believe it enough to follow it, even if you can&#x27;t explain all of it. Science has spent the last 2000+ years catching up to things the ancient greeks found to work.<p>Much like a running coach can&#x27;t really tell you WHY, exactly, everything he is having you do is working, it just does. Physiology has slowly been providing more and more detail, in the mean time running coaches have learned through trial and error how to train very efficiently. Some day we will probably have an exact explanation for the mechanisms of physiological improvement. Until then we can use our very good heuristics. I would argue it is the same from psychological perspective. It is close enough. Trust in your system and intuition and work to make it better and progress as a human being. There is no &quot;perfect system&quot; for everyone, but I think we could all agree on some pretty broad ideals that count as forward progress as humans :)",1405960863

If completely ignoring the relevance of an argument isn&#x27;t a powerful argumentative tool, I&#x27;m not sure what is.<p>Why would you do that? For me it&#x27;s important to note because premises are assertions, and conflicts of interest raise the likelihood that the premises have been deliberately constructed as to be false or misleading. The idea that I would throw out someone&#x27;s argument because I&#x27;ve decided that it must be wrong in advance seems ludicrous.<p>Arguments should rise or fall on their own merits.<p>>But isn&#x27;t that exactly what&#x27;s happening in the infomercial case? And surely we shouldn&#x27;t waste our (bounded, finite) time addressing, point-by-point, infomercial arguments?<p>Why exactly wouldn&#x27;t we, and why would we assume that the claims that are made in infomercials are uniformly false? The reason I don&#x27;t waste my time vetting the arguments in infomercials is because I&#x27;m not currently interested in a juicer, not because of a belief that people who make infomercials are liars, no matter how consistent their arguments or verifiable their premises.<p>>I typically do this with a 9/11 truther friend (also chem trains and luminati (sp?) and so on), and only consider his factoids non-fictional when I hear them from other sources as well.<p>I don&#x27;t. The reason I ignore truthers is because their logic is consistently bad, and their premises are usually demonstrably false. Those reasons came <i>after</i> listening to their arguments, not before. There are plenty of questionable elements in the official narrative, too, but they&#x27;re not in the same order of magnitude as the leaps of logic made by truthers.",1405960329

If you really need to read, you can do it in componentWillUpdate and write in componentDidUpdate.

I am not intending to be argumentative in the slightest.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s context for .NET is only broader due to community effort and NOT due to Microsoft&#x27;s active help. When .NET first came out, was it as widely usable on all those platforms and for different types of applications? No, and that&#x27;s exactly the position that Swift is in right now.\nIn a few years time, there might be a community effort for Swift on different platforms, but look at the success of GNUstep and the libraries surrounding it; there is not wide adoption by any means yet Obj-C remains popular.<p>A large portion of the list of applications that you mention are typically Windows platforms - Windows desktop applications, Windows Store applications, web applications on Windows servers, Windows phone apps. Replace the word &quot;Windows&quot; with Apple or iOS and you get the complaint that the parent mentioned. It&#x27;s entirely a point of view problem, ie you don&#x27;t get iOS/Mac OSX developers complaining about new language features in T-SQL when SQL Server is not available for iOS/Mac.<p>I suppose the same complaints were made against .NET all those years ago - &quot;why bother learning it? I can use the libraries and languages I already know!&quot;. It is a poor complaint to make really, as the effectiveness of a language or library does not depend on it being open source, eg. Java (years ago), the Win32 API, MFC, Carbon, Cocoa, C++ (does the committee steer itself based on our suggestions we just throw at them?). Their success and use has happened on closed-source platforms and with closed-source devices, but it&#x27;s entirely irrelevant in the same way that adoption of an open-source language is, surely?<p>It would be interesting if Apple does open source Swift, but as you say they won&#x27;t promote Swift outside Apple apps (in the same way that I can&#x27;t see that much marketing material from Microsoft encouraging us to use Mono on Linux; ie, Microsoft doesn&#x27;t promote .NET use outside Windows platforms either). But that doesn&#x27;t stop an army of C# developers existing.\nIt would be interesting to know how many of the C# developers use that language because it is available on multiple platforms (perhaps we could have a poll?). I would think that very very few developers are using because they know it is cross-platform to some extent (&quot;I&#x27;m going to use C# and .NET for my Active Directory MMC snap-in page because I can attempt to compile it on another platform!&quot;); in fact, C# and .NET jobs mention Windows development 98.9% of the time don&#x27;t they?<p>I just thought that refusing to even take a look at a language due to it not being open-soured was a bit of a foolish thing to do or complain about, and to be upset that a language (designed by a company for its own operating systems and own devices) was not available on other platforms and OSes was a bit of an odd complaint to make too!<p>EDIT: I have reread this and it sounds quite harsh! I don&#x27;t mean it to sound harsh. I did not know that Microsoft has opened up the .NET system a bit; I was more attempting to highlight that the original parent&#x27;s comments was a bit whiney for no reason, and I wasn&#x27;t meaning to pick a quarrel with you btw.

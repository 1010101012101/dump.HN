They were cleaning bathrooms, waiting for buses in the cold, dealing with criminals in bad neighborhoods, and living in apartments with cockroaches.<p>No, nobody at my school was doing this[1]. Top-tier schools leverage their massive endowments to provide substantial need-based financial aid. Basically their mission is to ensure, if you get in, that there is absolutely no financial friction to attend. In one high-profile instance Princeton University provided a full scholarship entirely from its own endowment to a formerly homeless undocumented immigrant who went on to become his class&#x27;s salutatorian[2].<p>[1] except the cockroaches but that applied to everyone as many of the dorms were quite old.<p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan-el_Padilla_Peralta"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan-el_Padilla_Peralta</a>",1448045944

10603080,comment,10599839,10601612,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"To add a datapoint:<p>I used to live in a very nice neighborhood in Minneapolis, MN with my GF and a child. House was just under 1,000 sq ft with unfinished basement and attic (not included in the sq footage). We loved it there. Great neighborhood: I could walk to the grocery store, or bus and restaurants etc. It was within walking distance of Lake Harriet (beautiful lake/park with free music performances, etc) and close to many other lakes and parks. We were outside a lot.<p>But we moved to a 2X larger house in the suburbs on a half-acre lot behind a nature preserve. Why?<p>Pretty much the only reason was that our son was going to be old enough to start kindergarten soon and the local schools sucked.<p>Private school was an option, but we soon figured out that it was cheaper to move to a bigger house in the suburbs in a better school district than to keep living in  the city and pay for private schools.<p>This is a common reason for parents to move out of very liveable  cities. It&#x27;s often <i>much</i> cheaper to move to the suburbs than pay for private schools, especially if you have 2 or 3 children. And with more and more businesses moving from city to suburban locations, it may even make your commute shorter (it did for both of us).<p>tl;dr: Improve public schools in cities and more parents will stay.",1448045896

There are some minor glitches in a 1st gen product I admit wholeheartedly. Most are fixed for me. I had a defective unit off lot 0 but the replacement and recent driver updates have fixed everything but the &quot;sometimes my mouse goes away&quot; and &quot;sometimes my screen pauses as the driver freaks out&quot;. Both are minor and correctible annoyances that are well known.<p>The Surface book gives me 7-8 hours of battery life doing Clojure development with deploy cycles with casual use, with audio streaming and bluetooth headphones. This eclipses my i7 OSX boxes, current gen, that typically conk out around 5 hours in the same config. The SB has a funny behavior though, it does connected standby like a tablet. It&#x27;ll hibernate, but the default is after 2 hours of standby. So you need to know that a bit of your battery life is being used there.<p>I highly recommend the surface book, unless you&#x27;re an iOS developer. Otherwise, your tools are universal. What I need is there: Docker support is handled via identical (or superior) mechanisms to what we do on OSX; X11 apps are supported about as well; you can get access to the tools you need but PowerShell is actually very whiz-bang and advanced once you see it for what it is; the security model is better than OSX; and honestly I like Win10 better than OSX, which feels incredibly dated by comparison.",1448045790

Although every computer and smartphone user could ultimately benefit from advances in my field of research, my customer would not be the end user, but the manufacturers.<p>I assume that this applies to the vast majority of scientists so the picture actually looks quite grim if you want to keep working in your profession. Many scientists need to change to an unrelated or remotely related field in order to get out of academia.",1448045339

We&#x27;ve been through Pivotal, Lighthouse and Trello, and one team is still using JIRA.<p>That said, our use case is explicitly tracking backlog — <i>work</i> that needs to get done. My philosophy is that any issue tracker that is treated as a database and that disassociates items from assignments will decay into a pile of rot almost immediately. Especially bugs. Don&#x27;t put anything into the database that does not represent work to be done within the next few days.<p>So we use Asana as a collaboration tool that brings together stakeholders, information and assets. Typical workflow: Account manager brings issue to attention of project manager, who brings it to attention of developer, who does the work, sends it back so customer can be notified. Task goes away. Another typical workflow is an actual project, with steps to complete and a launch timeline.<p>The only way, in my experience, to manage <i>bugs</i> is to give them to a project manager. The PM triages: Forget or hide the unimportant ones away in a drawer, and fix the important ones ASAP. Bugs that linger aren&#x27;t important enough to consider. Sometimes everyone is too busy and the bugs are important but not critical; schedule a single day of the week when everyone puts aside their main work and plow through the bug backlog. We call them &quot;bug days&quot;.<p>For new features, use something else, like Google Docs. But it will rot, too.

(1) we have a transformation called sub1, and (2) we have a step operation (returning an array with the transformed x appended to it).<p>We can use this same logic to create filters with an if statement..<p><pre><code>  lt2 = lambda x: x < 2\n  filter(lt2, [1,2,3])\n  reduce(lambda acc, x: acc + [x] if lt2(x) else acc, [1,2,3], [])\n</code></pre>\nA critical thing to notice in each of these cases is that if we ran a curried filter and map (with transformation / filtering functions already passed), then they would loop over the data twice. However, if you look at the example on this github repo, the want to<p>* take 3 elements from the sequence<p>* perform a transformation (map operation) to those elements<p>Notice that in this case take is being performed before the map, but you could imagine doing something like<p>* map items from geometric series to float<p>* filter items that are greater than .15<p>* take 3 of the remaining items<p>How would you do that with map and filter functions without looping over the entire (inexhaustible) sequence?<p>This is the beauty of transformers and transducers, they provide a composable approach to filtering, transforming, and taking elements from a (possibly infinite) sequence.<p>Of course, all of this could be done in a for loop, but often it introduces complexity..<p><pre><code>  # assume geom_series is the generator from the github example\n  take = 3\n  for el in geom_series:\n      if float(el) < .15:\n          result.append(el)\n          if len(result) == take: break\n</code></pre>\nHowever, this for loop is using the same ideas: we have a transformation / if (predicate) operation, and step operation to append the data we want. The problem transducers try to solve is writing a series of these types of operations compactly and cleary as a pipeline of functions (erm, transformers), so those functions can be replaced/moved around quickly, and the pipelines can be combined together simply.<p>A good article that covers tranducers in javascript (sorry!) is here:<p><a href=""http://simplectic.com/blog/2014/transducers-explained-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simplectic.com/blog/2014/transducers-explained-1/</a>",1448045132

At the end of the day the creditcard simply uses a normal credit card transaction, which is denominated in dollars and paid for by Coinbase, in dollars, to the merchant.<p>All Coinbase does is \n1) make sure you enough bitcoin to cover the transaction\n2) sell your bitcoin to recoup the dollars they&#x27;re paying on your behalf to the merchant<p>None of this has anything to do with the blockchain or bitcoin as a technology. It&#x27;s purely a practical product to make it a bit easier to make payments when you have a lot of money stored in bitcoin. I doubt it&#x27;ll be anything significant, various other players like Xapo did this in a similarly reasonably professional manner and none of that blew up, either.<p>The reason it&#x27;s not all that interesting is\n1) again, it has nothing to do with bitcoin/blockchain\n2) you need to store your bitcoin at a centralised company, essentially creating the equivalent of a traditional bank or financial service with the same issues and with no real extra benefits\n3) it solves none of the myriad of security and fraud issues that have plagued creditcards we&#x27;ve had for decades (creditcards are basically plastic sheets of text, the text being the password to your money vault, and you have to hand it over all the time to make payments. It&#x27;s an insane security premise)\n4) it&#x27;s actually pretty expensive, not only are creditcards expensive (both due to fraud and because you&#x27;re putting profit into the pockets of a middleman), but on top you&#x27;re essentially doing a forex currency conversion (in this case bitcoin -> usd) everytime you make a payment.<p>They&#x27;re advertising &#x27;no fees&#x27; at the moment, of course that&#x27;s not structural. In fact I&#x27;m a bit surprised that legal gave the OK to charge customers $10 for a product without communicating usage fees for said product on any specific timeline whatsoever, normally that&#x27;s guaranteed trouble & customer complaints down the line. That&#x27;s like your ISP charges you $100 to install your internet connection, then says &#x27;no monthly internet fees for a limited time&#x27;. You can bet your ass it&#x27;ll turn into a gigantic mess a few months later when you suddenly start charging usage fees.<p>Still, I welcome it.

And for the last 7 years I&#x27;ve kept a daily todo.txt, where I append today&#x27;s date and the 1-2 things I want to try to get done, adding detail as I figure out plans. (This is the only task tracking tool I&#x27;ve recommended that coworkers adopt and are actually using years later)<p>I&#x27;ve come to conclude that no tool for this will ever satisfy everybody&#x27;s needs perfectly. Part of that is that everyone has different priorities for their task tracking tool. And frankly, some of those priorities are directly contradictory. What&#x27;s trackable and detailed to a project manager who lives in the task tracker is heavyweight and clunky to an engineer who sees it as a bookkeeping annoyance. My personal todo.txt is exactly me-focused and only changes when I want it to, but it scales to exactly one engineer.<p>I think you just have to pick something and use it. Changing tools just adds friction and costs you familiarity. Ideally, the people who have to interact with it the most choose the best tool for them.",1448044212

The problem was discovered after a single report to the company in early November of a seatbelt assembly breaking.&quot;<p>&quot;A Tesla spokesman said Friday there have been no accidents or injuries related to the problem. Tesla officials emailed owners of the battery powered luxury sedan asking them to bring their cars to one of about 125 Tesla service centers worldwide for an inspection.&quot;<p>&quot;Tesla may send service technicians to customers if necessary, a spokesman said. The company sells and services its cars with its own personnel and stores. Other automakers get recall repairs done through networks of dealers.&quot;<p>So, they start by mentioning it&#x27;s an immaterial cost, which eases investor concerns. Then say that they&#x27;re taking action after a single customer anecdote, which shows driver safety is paramount. Then mention that their have been no injuries/accidents furthering the safety-first narrative. Then they state the number of service centers worldwide to which a customer can go to have the issue addressed. And finally a nice jab at traditional automakers, saying that Tesla will address the issue with its own personnel whereas it would traditionally be outsourced.<p>So, yeah, I think it&#x27;s fair to call it a marketing ploy.

I especially never thought I&#x27;d ditch it for a Microsoft product. And perhaps most importantly, I never thought I&#x27;d use an editor that didn&#x27;t have Vim keybindings (yet! it&#x27;s at the top of their list, apparently).<p>But after using VS Code for a while now I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll keep using it, at least for Node.js development. The IntelliSense support through TypeScript definitions, the out-of-the-box support for what I consider essentials (linting, task running, emmett, etc.), and perhaps most importantly the built-in debugger make my life significantly easier.<p>I enjoyed working with node-inspector, but the debugging in VS Code is a lot more convenient (mostly).<p>To be fair, for non-node development I&#x27;d say VS Code is not yet good enough to replace Sublime Text, but that might change when enough plugins and features have been added.<p>What it boils down to for me is that VS Code somehow seems to be optimized exactly for my workflow. It doesn&#x27;t have tons of buttons and interface elements that I don&#x27;t need (as many IDE&#x27;s do), and it isn&#x27;t slow. But on the other hand it offers very sensible defaults that other editors such as Atom and Sublime don&#x27;t have. On both those editors I&#x27;ve had some issues with setting up linting, debugging, IntelliSense, and a few misc. other things. The main reason for that, I suppose, is that they&#x27;re all plugins developed by different people. I like how these just come with VS Code and work right away.<p>I&#x27;m rather baffled that I&#x27;m saying all this, considering my general aversion of using Microsoft products (even if this is based on the past). But it is what it is. VS Code is a huge timesaver for me, and (mostly) hits the sweet spot between plain, fast editor and IDE.<p>But please give me Vim support ASAP :).",1448042703

10602692,comment,10602234,10602437,0,0,RyanZAG,,,"Not exactly - three years ago the shipping demand hit an all time high. Large container companies began building new never-before-seen super cargo ships which can carry an enormous amount of cargo. These ships rolled out of the production line earlier this year and have had a very heavy impact on shipping. The slowdown in the Chinese economy compounded this, as China is one of the largest users of shipping.<p>As the Chinese economy picks up and global trade values continue to rise with growing populations, this effect should decrease and you should see shipping prices rise. Compounding this is that smaller shipping companies are being merged into larger ones as the low prices make their business unsustainable.<p>So you can also expect this index to spike rapidly in the future as consolidation occurs.",1448042675

This procedure may detect an improperly attached seat belt but performing this procedure does not replace the need for an inspection by a Tesla technician.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s cool that they&#x27;re being so straightforward, but it&#x27;s weird to see that sort of procedure so casually recommended to the end user.<p>Edit: I got my appointment scheduled for next week.

Citizens benefit because bad police (which we hope are a minority) are discouraged from acting poorly, due to pervasive evidence, and the police benefit because there is a clear documented record of What Happened, which helps prevent spurious claims of police misconduct.<p>It&#x27;s something that most of the police seem not to want, judging from reactions towards journalists and people with cameras, so it&#x27;s not the __police__ asking for more surveillance.

645368,comment,645163,645163,0,0,JimmyL,,,"I guess the new business model being presented is the dealer network owning the company (as opposed to the other way around), and the ""company"" being centered on design and marketing, as opposed to manufacturing. In some ways - but on a larger and more expensive scale - it reminds me of how the computer industry changed from corporate-owned manufacturing, to everyone using four or five no-name companies in Taiwan for everything. It worked out pretty well for the major players in that industry (Dell, Compaq, Apple, etc.), so I wonder how it will work out for cars.<p>I'm not sure, however, how it will work out with the labour situation for factories (I'm thinking long-term, once their two-year contract with GM expires). In order to make this work, you'll have to have some free-standing auto plants willing to bid for the contracts to build the cars; an industry which doesn't currently exist (almost all auto factories are owned by car manufacturers). Conventional economics says that in order to get prices down with this process, you'd have to have competition in the bidding process for these plants, but I'm not convinced that there would be enough (any) plants who would bid for them. I'm also not sure how the existing supplier network would work out, and how they'd stay in business.<p>All-in, it will be interesting how this shakes out over the next five to ten years - if it works, it's got the potential to change how the industry works.",1244336192

It also matters that parents have the time to spend with their kids, read with their kids, help them with homework, etc.; that the kids have the time to work on school instead of at minimum wage jobs trying to keep the family fed; that they have supportive teachers and fellow students; that they have proper materials and decent workspaces; that they have someone to go to for help when they don’t know about something; that they have connections when applying to schools or job searching; etc.<p>Kids of professors have a whole host of social and material advantages that can't just be boiled down to “better culture.” I really don’t think that the ability of professors’ kids growing up to be lawyers or doctors really says all that much about overall “social mobility.”",1244335373

645338,comment,644956,644956,0,0,sedachv,,,"I used to like arguing over the Internet about this subject. There are many good technical and management/organizational arguments you can make for and against macros. What I've come to realize is they're all pretty much irrelevant.<p>The entire point of programming is automation. The question that immediately comes to mind after you learn this fact is - why not program a computer to program itself? Macros are a simple mechanism for generating code, in other words, automating programming. Unless your system includes a better mechanism for automating programming (so far, I have not seen any such mechanisms), _not_ having macros means that you basically don't understand _why_ you are writing code.<p>This is why it is not surprising that most software sucks - a lot of programmers only have a very shallow understanding of why they are programming. Even many hackers just hack because it's fun. So is masturbation.<p>This is also the reason why functional programming languages ignore macros. The people behind them are not interested in programming automation. Wadler created ML to help automate proofs. The Haskell gang is primarily interested in advancing applied type theory.<p>Which brings me to my last point: as you probably know, the reputation of the functional programming people as intelligent is not baseless. You don't need macros if you know what you are doing (your domain), and your system is already targeted at your domain. Adding macros to ML will have no impact on its usefulness for building theorem provers. You can't make APL or Matlab better languages for working with arrays by adding macros. But as soon as you need to express new domain concepts in a language that does not natively support them, macros become essential to maintaining good, concise code. This IMO is the largest missing piece in most projects based around domain-driven design.",1244334618

Have you read ""Genetic evidence for complex speciation of humans and chimpanzees""[2]?<p>Sokal <i>et al.</i> acted in bad faith by cherry-picking the worst instances of postmodernist discourse and setting up postmodernism as a monolithic entity universally opposed to the values of scientific inquiry.  <i>I Love To You</i>[3] is an example of a book written by a post-modernist (one of the ones Sokal <i>et al.</i> made fun of, incidentally) without any obvious obfuscation.

The only thing proping them up is gov't monopoly rights.  At some stage (of remediable innefficiency), it makes more sense to have an ""art tax"" and pay the artists directly.  why should society pay functionaly usesless intermediaries 80 cents on the dollar? to duplicate files and send them over the intenet? Cmon.  If an alternative (irs) can do this via taxes and NP foundations for 20 cents overhead, without reducing the artist production incentive?  There dies the public policy argument supporting ""recording"" industry.  It goes without saying that artists make all their money performing live and through sales of T-shirts.  This would continue...Society is better off...No? Whats not to love. Spotify and soundcloud and you-tube et al could still have a role (they pre-suppose the existence of product in any event).",1346025562

4436707,comment,4427319,4428707,1,0,azakai,,,"The main problem is that Mandreel is closed source. I don't have access to it, so I can't just compile two C++ benchmarks and compare the results.<p>However, I suspect the Emscripten version is faster, for a few reasons:<p>* Indirect measurements on Box2D in that link indicate Emscripten is faster.<p>* Looking at the generated code shows several things Emscripten does better, for example it uses the native JS stack for function calls (Mandreel pushes all the arguments onto the emulated C stack which is additional work), the Emscripten relooper implementation is more optimized, etc.<p>* Emscripten uses closure compiler to minify and further optimize the generated code while Mandreel does not. This mainly affects download size, but not only - closure can do optimizations at the JS level that can't be done before, like for example inlining handwritten glue code in JS into compiled JS code.<p>* Mandreel used to use an older version of LLVM and Clang than Emscripten, which always uses the latest, and there have been big 'free' speedups in Emscripten due to improvements in the LLVM optimizer. (But, perhaps Mandreel has updated, without access to it I don't know.)<p>* Emscripten has gotten a lot of issues filed about performance issues, pull requests, etc. as a benefit of being open source, which led to plenty of improvements. I can't be sure but I am guessing there are fewer people that bought a Mandreel license and contributed feedback.<p>Note though that the question of which is fastest is a little problematic - one compiler's output might be faster in one browser but slower in another, so there isn't an objective sense of ""fastest"" here. But with that said, there are aspects of the code that should be faster in all browsers, like as mentioned above the more optimized way that Emscripten does function calls.",1346024973

Every phone/tablet/pda out there had to implement a scrolling interface for lists, whether it be for contacts, todo items, or call logs, however nobody has created a scrolling interface as usable as Apple's first scrolling interface on the iphone.  Their flick scrolling with inertia was probably the first time I wasn't in pain scrolling through a thousand entries.<p>How can anyone disagree about scrolling being novel?  If it was not a novel idea, Nokia should have implemented this on their phones so it wouldn't take a thousand button presses to get to the bottom of my contact list.<p>When something is novel, every instance prior to the invention would implement it (scrolling) in various different ways, and after the invention it would all be implemented in the same way that emulates the invention.  I can't think of an instance where someone implements scrolling without a flick + inertia nowadays.<p>Hence, the invention brought something new to the table that was never used prior to its existence, and everyone now copies because they feel it is the proper way to do something.<p>Here's a simplistic straw-man:  Prior to the transistor, everyone used vacuum tubes.  After the transistor invention, everyone uses transistors.<p>Everyone used standard scrollbars on handhelds before Apple's invention, however they now use flick/inertia scrolling and nobody goes back to standard scrollbars.",1346024641

4436688,comment,4436150,4436150,52,0,adastra,,,"I'm friends with some people who have worked for Dan.  Here's the best article I could find that might give some insight on what happened. Short answer is each year event per-participant expenses kept increasing (Pallotta has a bit of a ""spendy"" reputation), until it got out of control. At his last event only 14% of the money raised actually went to the charities:<p><a href=""http://www.commondreams.org/headlines.shtml?/headlines02/0827-08.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.commondreams.org/headlines.shtml?/headlines02/082...</a><p>Some more backstory: to his credit Dan Pallotta did create the AIDS rides and cancer walks. They seem common now, but at the time they were innovative and very successful in dramatically increasing the donations going to these charities. Then expenses started to climb. Dan likes everything to be very nice, luxurious even, for his participants. As the money rolled in, he spared no expense on having the best facilities, logistics, design, etc. for his events. At some point he screwed up his math, the expenses ate almost all the profits, and the AIDS and cancer charities went ballistic. And they got the press involved.<p>In addition, Pallotta Teamworks was set up as a for-profit company.  This was not what caused the controversy, but it certainly added to it.  Also not helping matters from a PR perspective is that Dan was known to pay himself a very large salary and live the high-end L.A. lifestyle. He also spent a very large sum (millions) on outfitting a warehouse into a unique, custom-designed office space that was something out of a bond movie. He wasn't doing anything malicious, but these things didn't help when the wave of bad press hit.<p>The sponsors found it easy to find people, including some of Dan's own employees, who were glad to duplicate the events. Except this time they only used non-profits, and guaranteed a minimum percentage of donations that would go to the actual charities.<p>Update: pictures of the above-mentioned Pallotta Teamworks office space (gallery at bottom of page):<p><a href=""http://www.pallottateamworks.com/about_apostrophe.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pallottateamworks.com/about_apostrophe.php</a>",1346024597

It was sold at a severe loss to begin with to push the technology and ramp up volume production of those drives.<p>> They entered the phone market when capacitive touchscreens were cheap/large enough<p>The iPhone's screen was far and away the biggest cost of the device. It was moving so many of them that dropped the price. You're accusing Apple of jumping at an opportunity when they see a cheap enough component. That's entirely not true, that is what their competitors do.<p>What they do is choose a key component for their device and drive down the price through massive volume sales that nobody else can achieve. It was true for the hard drive in the iPod, the flash memory in the Nano and the capacitive screen in the iPhone.<p>If you're saying they didn't invent the HD, memory or screen themselves, that's fair.

I use Humira which if I understand correctly is a human monoclonal antibody glued to a receptor that interferes with something to do with T-cells.

Thing is, Apple's designs were still nothing like anything people had seen. The picture in the post is actually proving my own point, not the OP's. That photo also illustrates how the same design concept can be made without blatant copying. All those phones and PDAs have the big-screen-couple-button design style but still look like entirely different models of devices. Even post-iPhone devices all look different while still retaining their heritage with the exception of the Samsung devices in question. It doesn't take an expert in technology, patents, phones, or any expert at all to see that after the iPhone debuted, a lot of Samsung phones started to look a lot more iPhone-like. Everything from the materials, to the colors, to the shape, and even custom changes to the Android UI all closely mimicked the iPhone. The idea was to get regular folks confused into either thinking they were buying the iPhone or make them think they were buying the equivalent of one. Now, regular folks often do think all smartphones look alike but when you walk into a phone store those same people can tell that those phones are made by different companies. They can at least differentiate between the lookalike phones to the point where they understand they're not all the exact same phone. What Samsung tried to do is blur the lines even further to the point where those normal folks who were looking for an iPhone could potentially get confused into thinking they were buying one because of the way they pretty much cloned the iPhone.<p>The patent system may be fucked but what Samsung was doing was wrong and patents were the best tool Apple could use to send a meaningful message and get them to stop. This case isn't all that good to argue the shortcomings of the patent system. There's too much biased information about it out there and everyone tends to just defend their camp. It turns into a Apple v. Android argument in the end. If you want to argue patents then argue patents. The fact is, Apple held patents, Samsung infringed, and justice was done. You can argue whether the patents should have been granted or not but you can't say Apple <i>shouldnt</i> have won because the patents <i>should have</i> never been granted. Too late.

I, for one, did not know that.<p>I've cancelled cards previously because merchants were unreasonable or unresponsive. Gyms are one of the worst for this. Cancelling a gym membership is an exercise in torture.<p>Anecdote: I was in an Equinox gym a couple of months ago, thinking about joining. I saw a ""representative"" who was happy to give a tour through the gym and explain the costs and benefits. For these sorts of things however I give a fake phone number because I loathe the follow-up calls from such places.<p>Anyway, at one point while standing around reception where there were 5 or so such representatives standing around the receptionist answered the phone. Someone was inquiring about closing their account. She said they had to speak to a specialist and none were available. What the...? No one else seemed to be with a customer. It just struck me as another tactic to make it more difficult to cancel.<p>Now for me this would be relatively easy. My company has a corporate membership so it can be deducted directly from payroll and when I say for it to stop, it stops. But honestly I can't condone these hard sell tactics by giving such companies my money.<p>Cancelling a gym membership should be as simple as a 2 minute phone call or (better yet) clicking a button on a Website (Equinox has a Website where you can reserve exercise bikes no less).<p>My only experience with dispute resolution was reasonably painful although not as bad as it could be. I ordered something online and the merchant called me to say that price was only when I bought it as part of a package. I said I didn't want it. He said fine. A week later it turned up anyway. I had the charge reversed. They applied it again. I had it reversed (again). I had to send the item back by registered post.<p>I think the lesson to take from gym memberships and similar fixed-fee for shared usage pricing models is that they create the wrong incentives. Gyms really want customers who pay every month but never come in so they can oversell their capacity. If gyms were pay-for-use you simply wouldn't have this problem. Likewise you could discount memberships for people who come in at non-peak times, etc.<p>Some point out the ""you signed a contract"" argument and agreed to those terms. To this I response: people have an innate sense of fairness. People will (rightly IMHO) reject unreasonable terms. If I don't pay my gym membership, I can no longer go to the gym. This isn't like failing to make a car payment.<p>Unfortunately consumers seem to like monthly fees so you kind of get what you ask for.",1346022091

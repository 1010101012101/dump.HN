And then figure out how to produce enough revenue to pay for all of that overhead. I'm not sure anyone has figured out how to monetize forum moderation well enough to make it pay well enough for moderators to enjoy it. I write this as someone who has been a forum moderator since 1992 (starting out on the Prodigy proprietary online network) and who still has volunteer moderation responsibilities in various places today. What compensates me for moderating in the places where I do it is a good atmosphere of informative discussion, and the chance to do something about making the atmosphere better. But if have an Internet service provider account, I might very well like knowing that the service provider disapproves of off-topic messages, but I wouldn't like to be the person enforcing that, because anywhere I visit on the Internet will still have visitors from other ISPs, and thus the place I visit may still be full of off-topic messages, but if I work for Verizon I have to deal with all the people complaining about my decisions who visit all the sites I don't care a whit about. My best single way to get the atmosphere I want now is to visit only sites (like HN, for instance) where somehow there is a culture in which contributors outnumber pests. No one has to pay me to help preserve that culture, and no one COULD pay me to attempt to build that culture somewhere where it has already broken down.",1260143116

To me this suggests that quality apps are perfect substitutes, and are selling at as close to marginal cost as possible. Once you fall out of the top 10, however, the competition is more monopolistic, and you can raise your price such that you sell the quantity where marginal cost equals marginal revenue.<p>This seems backwards to a traditional market, where the competition is more monopolistic in the higher quality products, and more perfectly comptative in the lower quality products. <i>Interesting</i>.",1260142367

980348,comment,979170,979971,0,0,w00pla,,,"> When you say ""Africa"", I assume you are not speaking of ""South Africa"".<p>My experience is admittedly limited to Southern African countries (SADEC countries including Zambia and Angola). I chose the South African examples since they are the best documented.<p>But I see no reason to believe that there would be a significant difference in other African countries.<p>> Most of Africa has always been organised into communities, where the communities select a non-heriditary leader, who represents the community in a meeting of all local leaders.<p>Not really – I have not seen any evidence of this. Most of the leaders are hereditary or semi-hereditary (when the line is broken by the brother or family member of the chief).<p>As another example, take the Bamagwato. Ian Khama is the chief of the Bamagwato (in Botswana). He is the great-great grandson of Khama III (who is again had his chieftanship descend from his father). Ian Khama is the president of Botswana (this is not to detract from Botswana’s good governance and its incorporation of Western values).<p>> He cannot assign all the land to himself, that never happens in Africa (in constrast to Europe).<p>Unfortunately many similar things happen. A good example is the Reed Dance in Swaziland. King Mswati selects brides for himself from people (he recently selected one that was under the age of consent). The whole purpose of the Chief is self-serving.<p>> In Africa, the chief is a person who is best thought to represent the decisions of the people, and so what he says is representative of the people who he leads.<p>You live in a dream world. In the 1800’s, Shaka killed thousands of his own people because his mother died (and wanted people to share his pain). He also subjected them to famine.<p>> Ground is not communal, ground is owned by individuals in small portions across the villages or towns.<p>Not completely. Cattle are grazed communally and most work is performed communally. Ubuntu (most Bantu languages have a similar word) literally means “shared grazing land”. This actually also makes sense (specialisation of labour and all that).<p>> I believe there has hardly ever been a situation in Africa where a chief attacked his own people with an army, and caused some kind of internal massacre.<p>The Shaka example I showed you is a good example where he killed off and starved his own people.<p>I personally believe that you may have a little too romantic view of Africa (while I concede that I may suffer from the opposite).",1260142095

980317,comment,979836,980239,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Technically speaking yes it will draw power, all wiring draws power (the wires develop capacitance, but there's also electrostatic leakages around the bare connectors, but at 110/240V it's negligible, this is a concern around 10,000V+, with DC it likely has no electrostatic leakage, and very little drain due to capacitance.<p>However, what I believe you're thinking about is the transformer required to turn 110V->5V and yes you're correct. An old school transformer would drain a few watts when inactive, however the current types of transformers used in Wall->USB devices provide virtually no drain, perhaps less than a watt, so will have no noticeable effect on your electricity bill.<p>Simply put, changing say 20 wall sockets in your house to one of these USB devices will likely have less effect on your electricity bill than plugging in a 7W night light and leaving it in.",1260140931

In fact, the existing OBSERVED degree of IQ increases all around the world<p>I did not mention the Intelligence Quotient (which is subject to boosting). I mentioned the general intelligence factor (which is mostly innate). Using google scholar you can find many interesting articles about the general intelligence factor and its neurological basis.<p>Using google scholar with “general intelligence factor” I found this article that is cited 417 (it just struck my eye since the citations is extremely high for such a recent paper):<p>A Neural Basis for General Intelligence \nScience 21 July 2000:\nVol. 289. no. 5478, pp. 457 - 460\nDOI: 10.1126/science.289.5478.457<p>This one just struck my eye, but there are many more. In my opinion general intelligence factor has become beyond doubt – the question is now what the neurological basis for intelligence is.<p>I also think that we will not do this complex and interesting topic justice if we discuss it here.",1260140873

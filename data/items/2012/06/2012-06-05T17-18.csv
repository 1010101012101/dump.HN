Balance the reward cycle and tune the levels of challenge and frustration properly and you get players to spend more time in the game.<p>I agree that it's a stretch to conclude that D3 is less addictive than D2 but I took it as interesting speculation based on actual science.",1338919169

4069835,comment,4068594,4068594,4,0,MSM,,,"I think one of the big things that comes to mind is something I remember reading with competitive games like Counter Strike and Starcraft- the games where if you are doing poorly against the competition you're not enjoying yourself <i>at all</i>.<p>The sentiment was ""There is a large portion of gamers that do not enjoy <i>playing</i> games, they enjoy <i>winning</i> games.""<p>I think this translates to Diablo 3 very well- everyone was perfectly happy farming Diablo or Baal (previous ""final"" bosses), yet no one seems to enjoy farming Act 1 or Act 2 inferno. It's the <i>exact</i> same thing, but I believe people are not enjoying it because they are unable to beat the game.<p>I see a lot of talk about how it's impossible to beat the game just by grinding, and you have to play the AH to get gear from the people that have already beaten the game but it's important to remember that there were people that beat the game for the first time. These people didn't have people to purchase the best stuff of off because they were the furthest of anyone in the world.<p>Similarly, there are people progressing (albeit slowly) through inferno hardcore where there are probably less than ~100 people in the world. There's very little gear on the market and there are still people progressing by farming gear themselves.",1338919037
4069834,comment,4069209,4069209,1,0,ajlburke,,,"+ 1 on journal-keeping.<p>I've been keeping a diary for the last 8 years or so. The act of writing about and reflecting on each day is useful - but it's also very helpful to be able to look back on what your daily life was like in the past. It's easy to forget what you were <i>really</i> thinking about several years ago, and a diary is a great way to give yourself some realistic perspective.<p>Brief pitch: A big problem I had in getting started with diary keeping was that I'd get busy and not write anything for several days, and then I'd have trouble remembering what I did, say, last Tuesday. Sometimes, to be honest, I forget what I did <i>this morning</i>. I gather this is a common reason for losing the diary-keeping habit.<p>A few years ago I scratched my own itch on this and built ""Remembary"": an iPad diary app that collects photos, tweets, Facebook updates, and RSS feeds and organizes them by day, giving you some context to help you remember what you did each day. It's a bit like the iPhone app Momento, but iPad-native and focused more on writing rather than just collecting feeds.<p>If you're just getting into diary writing or have tried before but have had similar problems getting traction, you might want to check it out. I'm wrapping up a major version 2.0 update that should (hopefully!) be out in a few weeks. You can find out more at <a href=""http://remembary.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://remembary.com</a> (I'm about to revamp the site too).<p>It's cheaper than a Moleskine (if you already have an iPad anyhow), is easily searched, and can be backed up to DropBox or email, too.<p>/pitch",1338919031

Whenever you find an item that you can sell at the auction house - that's a reward. It's arguably as good as it is in Diablo 2.<p>I think the <i>real</i> reason why Diablo 3 is less addictive than Diablo 2 is simply because the folks who played Diablo 2 are now 12 years older. There's something about getting older that makes you less prone to being addicted to games.",1338919028

The subject could have been Martian fizzbozzles instead of microscopes.</i><p>And therein lies a great fallacy which is still widely believed in our post-Enlightenment world. But the map is not the terrain. A mental model cannot be completely represented with words or pictures, or anything. Words and pictures, even good ones chosen for pedagogical value, are only pale projections of a complex thing onto a flat surface.<p><i>>Anyone who can read and comprehend text can answer it with no prior knowledge of the subject.</i><p>Without qualification, this statement is strictly false. There may be certain kinds of text that can be comprehended with no prior knowledge of the subject if you assume a certain baseline of internalized knowledge. There are many old parlor games (which have sadly gone out of style) which rely on hacking this qualification. For example, one of them requires that one person follow the instructions of another. One person tries to describe how to draw a particular geometric figure. The person doing the drawing must follow the instruction, but they also are free (in fact encouraged) to ignore the <i>intention</i> of the instruction. It's a game that puts the difference between words and reality up-front and center.",1338919026

No no no. Normal people want to install an app and just have it work. They trust iOS apps because of a perception that they are carefully monitored, and because nothing particularly bad has ever happened. They don't trust the web because everyone has heard of email, credit card, etc. scams. One big reason for Apply to only allow in-app purchases through their system is that, therefore, third-party apps never see credit card information and can't do too much damage.<p>If you want web apps to succeed, figure out how a normal person is going to find, install, and trust a web app not to steal their credit card info.

Enterprise is all about features, workflows, politics and (sometimes but rarely) reducing costs (from a product and man-hours point of view), all I see is a simple project management tool that doesn't address any of this.<p>The idea of a cloud distributed project management portal  arguably makes it non-enterprise automatically (security or privacy policies anyone?) as does the fact that you guys are clearly not an enterprise yourself (although there is little you can do about this, it just puts you at an automatic disadvantage for consideration amongst many large corporations).<p>How will you guys support a support contract for an enterprise with 1000 users? What about 5000? Hows about 20,000?<p>My point behind all of this is that, to break the software lifecycle in large corporations in large numbers requires large amounts of money, and many multi-faceted strategies (which require considerable head counts), amongst many other complex considerations.<p>I suggest you guys have a long and hard think about who your customer really is in enterprise (its not the end user, its middle management) and think about pivoting into something which would ultimately not be as disruptive to an enterprise as a new project management portal (for the 10th time in as many years, as is usually the case) or ditch enterprise altogether, it sounds like you guys have a lot to learn before you can build a product for the enterprise, and there is nothing fun about doing this, trust me!<p>I do really like what you guys have done so far from a product point of view, the problem is that it totally is not appropriate for enterprise and is a very very long way from being even close, I think you guys should be doing something more like what Yammer are doing with their general business strategy (not targetting enterprises, just businesses, big and small, but mostly small) to have any chance at success, and because of the industry you have chosen (project management) with the added bonus of Yammer as a competitor its going to be tough to gain any traction regardless of business strategy, but you guys should be looking to at least maximise your chances instead of shooting yourselves in the foot.

I apologize for any typos/grammatical mistakes; I should probably get back to work, and that guilt is enough to prevent me from proofreading this super carefully.<p>--<p>So, I sort of agree with the linked post, but I feel it doesn't apply to the game as a whole, rather only to certain sections and to certain demographics.  I'll explain by digging into the presence/shape of the reward and frustration loops (which can co-exist, imo!) for each difficulty level both with and without use of the Auction House.<p>On Normal: The game is never very hard.  As a result, the frustration loop is non-existent for both AHers and non-AHers.  Players using the AH and players <i>not</i> using the AH are pretty much in the same boat, though decent items are inexpensive enough in this level range (1-30) that a player can pretty easily flatten the reward loop entirely (and thus never find anything truly useful to him/her) by purchasing new ""good"" gear every few levels that's very likely to blow away anything they're going to find.  tl;dr: on Normal, the AH serves only to destroy the reward loop (and removes all challenge from the game as well).<p>On Nightmare: The game begins to get more difficult; you realize things are a bit more serious the first time you see an elite pack with potently synergetic affixes.  The increased challenge does not frustrate most players, and for these players the game (as well as the effects the Auction House has on rewards/frustration) is the same as on Normal.  For inexperienced players, however, the effects explained in the OP's post begin to manifest themselves.  The game gets tough in some places, and the AH can alleviate this pain at very affordable prices. Using the AH creates a frustration loop because buying cheap, relatively powerful gear is easier than learning to play better, and as such the idea becomes to ""out-gear"" rather than ""out-think"" challenges.  This dampens the peaks of the reward loop significantly for AH users.  Nightmare is very doable without using the AH, and as such many users are unaffected and the game still feels a lot like Diablo II.<p>As of Hell, D3 becomes much, much harder.  Elite packs with deadly affix sets become common and characters can be killed very quickly at times whether or not they're prepared for what's coming.  Hell, I think, is the part of D3 that is most negatively impacted by the Auction House.  Hell is completable without using the AH, but it's hard enough/some parts are frustrating enough that many people will use the AH to augment their gear before finishing it (and will likely do so several times).  Hell difficulty, IMO, is where the linked post really shines, and I think everything in the OP's article really describes this very well.  Lots of people will use the AH to complete Hell, and as a result will experience the frustration loop and lack of a reward loop described in the post.  Since the gear necessary to complete Hell is very affordable still, players can buy their way out of difficult situations and power through without the addiction that comes along with finding awesome stuff every so often.<p>If you've read this far, thanks!  This is where the game changes.<p>On Inferno, the linked post doesn't apply.  Starting with Act II, Inferno becomes incredibly difficult to the point where characters just ""playing through"" and even characters who have been farming (collecting gold and new items) for awhile in Act I are eliminated by foes instantly and frequently.  Inferno is nigh-impossible (yes, some people have finished it, but the vast majority won't for awhile if at all) as it is intended to be and the absolute best gear is needed to progress without major pain.<p>This gear is very, very expensive, and most players won't be able to afford it.  I don't have statistics to back this up (yet?), but imagine that gear quality follows a power law distribution in which there is a <i>ton</i> of crap and only very infrequently do the wonderful things pop up.  The wonderful things are needed to progress on Inferno, so the demand for them is very high, higher even than it'd be if Inferno could be reasonably completed without them.  The game is now different.  Instead of being able to smoothly purchase the items you need as you go, there is a brick wall in front of you that says you must be THIS TALL to ride, and you're only half this tall.  So how do you get THIS TALL?  You farm.<p>You farm and farm and farm.  The game becomes about total equippable assets.  Say a suitable item for a given slot costs 1 million gold; 2x rings, 1x amulet, 1x chest, 1x helm, 1x boots, 1x pants, 1x weapon (2h for sake of example), 1x belt, 1x gloves, 1x shoulders = 11 items = 11 million gold.  You don't need to find or trade for 11 suitable items; you just need to be able to purchase them.  You feed the power law curve of crap on the Auction House by selling everything you think will sell for a reasonable price so that you can buy the super-expensive items you need to progress.<p>Here's the kicker: this means that the presence of the AH doesn't actually dilute the reward cycle!  The inability to trivially purchase everything you need means that the items you find have full meaning.  Even if you can't wear the good ones, you'll sell them or give them to friends who need them, building up gold and friend-goodwill s.t. they'll give you things they find as well.  In short, the incredibly high bar set by Inferno combined with the rarity of the items needed to progress through Inferno balances with the effects of the AH in cheapening the reward loop, restoring the feel of Diablo IIness.<p>For those wondering about the Inferno frustration loop, I argue that the presence of the AH doesn't change it.  Were it not for the AH, Blizzard would still find a difficulty bar befitting their highest difficulty.  (It would likely be easier to compensate for having no AH -- or perhaps good rare items would drop more frequently -- but the difficulty would likely not change substantially.)  In both cases, the very rare amazing finds are what pushes the player toward progression; in the AH case, the few major item find successes give the player the gold he needs to move on; in the non-AH case, the few major item finds are what you actually use.  The reward loops then are awfully similar if not the same (hence the feeling of Diablo IIness).<p>--<p>To sum up: for players who use the Auction House whenever it's in their best interest to do so before Inferno, yes, I agree with the linked post.  The game is cheapened, the reward loop doesn't feel as good or doesn't exist, and a lot of the challenge is removed.  This does, however, allow Blizzard to make the game more difficult for players looking for a challenge (as not using the AH through Hell is pretty tough!) while still making it possible for less experienced players (via using the AH).  Perhaps that's part of their design, and they should have made it more obvious (like a recommendation not to use it for experienced players until later, etc).",1338918026

For example, instead of looking who got the ""right"" answer, you could look at which wrong answers people selected and why. For example, students who chose ""A"" probably have experience with microscopes, perhaps don't read instructions carefully.<p>More interestingly, you could learn a lot about a student's thought process by analyzing the time spent on a particular question, or whether they chose another answer choice before settling on one, or whether It's possible that the computer adaptive exams (GRE, GMAT, NCLEX, etc.) take this into account because the computer can collect this data, but paper and pencil tests simply cannot.<p>A student who chose answer choice ""A"" after 5 seconds is probably careless or overconfident, whereas a student who chose ""A"" after a minute of waffling between ""A"" and ""C"" possibly lacks confidence.<p>I think standardized tests could become a lot more useful if we could collect more data from them.",1338917753

4069662,comment,4068958,4069115,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"""However, it's only a matter of time until these minor issues are fixed""<p>I think that is not true, And I'll share my reasoning as to why I believe that and then someone can help tell me why I'm wrong.<p>My argument is that 'minor issues' are a function of design change + implementation maturity. Which is to say that as a design evolves, the evolution requires changes in the base code, these changes have ripple effects on other things that had made assumptions about the implementation and tracking down the ripples gets as far as the 'big ones' and then it ships with the proviso that the smaller problems will get ironed out 'over time'. Except once you release the newer version it sparks new design changes and those changes create ripples of their own and so even when the original minor irritations are fixed, you cannot tell they are fixed because there are new minor irritations to contend with. I claim that this is an unavoidable consequence of the 'bazaar' aspect of FOSS development. People write code, they want to contribute, they change stuff, there is few barriers to good ideas getting into the project, so there is no governor on change so there is no time for the changes to stabilize. In the 'cathedral' mode some company stops development, and works only on stability for some period of time, so that the final product is 'done.' This is not to say that cathedral software doesn't have 'minor annoyances' it can, but often that version will continue to be stabilized with <i>no new features</i> over time. And that is externally enforced by a management heirarchy.<p>I think it would be safe to say that minor issues that are left in Gnome 2 will be fixed over time, as there are very few people putting in new features to 2 and slightly more people putting in bug fixes. But that occurs because its a 'dead' project from the perspective of 'new' stuff.",1338917145

4069652,comment,4068229,4068455,3,0,crazycanuck,,,"Further to this and dcaranda, EBITDA is used for valuations because it describes the cash flow the business has available to pay various stakeholders before any financial structures are taken into account. There are three people who have a claim on the cash a company generates after paying operating expenses: debt holders, the government, and shareholders. Their claims on the money go roughly in that order, so in other words the shareholders get what's left (directly via dividends or stock buybacks or indirectly via an increase in the equity value) after the debt holders and the man are paid.<p>The thing is, however, how much you owe the government is affected by how much debt you have (i.e. your financial structure), because the debt interest is deductible. It's largely because of this that EBITDA is the preferred thing to use, as opposed to say earnings or cash flow, because it enables you to compare companies at a fundamental level unaffected by whatever financial structure they might currently have. One of the things PE guys like to do is fiddle with the financial structure (aka load it up with debt ;-), so it's important to understand the value ex whatever impact the current structure might have. But even if that's not your motive, it's a useful measure for the same underlying reasons.<p>It's also true that EBITDA is a useful number for PE because it tells you the amount of money available to service debt, as dcaranda points out.",1338917043

If you're gearing up to try and raise money, that is some important insight, your business is potentially in the balance right now.<p>I've been trying to wrap my mind around the FB IPO for a while now.  FB was ordained by the media.  It was the next great Silicon Valley company,  Zuck is the new Gates/Jobs/Dell/etc..  All the hype was about ""biggest ever.""   There was very little real criticism, there were some doubters but nobody expected the stock to perform like this.  FB was/is a legitimate Google competitor...    I think in some circles people were skeptical about the value of social and its real 'value' but still, nobody was predicting this.  It was going to climb up to $70 and then settle in around $45-$50, that's what everybody wanted and expected.<p>To me, it shows that the investors have already closed their wallets.  Maybe it shows something worse.  Talking about it legitimizes the concerns people clearly have been having already but that doesn't mean they weren't there already or that it's suddenly worse.  It may accelerate some things by making for less stupid people that aren't in the know but it was already happening.  The stock market has done well the last 4 years but I don't know how many other indicators show that the whole economy is doing well and I think a lot of people (think not elite web hackers) would think or say we're still in the great recession,  employment is still in the 10% range (maybe higher depending upon who's spin you want to take to heart) they're still sorting out mortgages and all that ilk, who knows how useful all the people coming back from the wars are I'm sure they've got some emotional issues but who knows when they'll surface, what percentage of college grads have no jobs?  and then you've almost certainly got to unwind the Euro from Greece and who knows how that's going to work.  Worse, if it goes pretty bad, then it's probably bad for the whole world and if it goes really well then the uncertainty could continue as there might be pressure to boot other countries out of the EU rather than bail them out.",1338916250

Manually curating a relevant stream of content requires alot of energy and effort. Right now, Facebook is the easiest, lowest effort source of content.
I imagine most Hacker News readers are pretty advanced when it comes to content discovery. But the average user is not as savy.

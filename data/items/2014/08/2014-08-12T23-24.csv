8170845,comment,8169591,8170204,2,0,bane,,,"If these guys were called &quot;professional pranksters&quot; I&#x27;d be fine with it. Good on them, great prank. Lots of laughs. White flags, just like surrendering, haha.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of good modern art. I don&#x27;t really think art should necessarily return to classic form. I&#x27;m writing this as I listen to some Steve Reich music and I have a Ryan McGinness print right over my computer.<p>But I&#x27;m afraid the art world these days is basically optimized around trying to produce output that&#x27;s purely intended to confuse, shock or outrage. It&#x27;s like the art world has lost the ability to recognize and evoke <i>any</i> other emotion. It&#x27;s become so insular and incestuous that so much that&#x27;s produced in the art world these days has any relevance or meaning at all -- it&#x27;s almost psychopathic.<p>Except instead it&#x27;s boring, pretentious and trite. Evoking negative emotions is <i>easy</i>.<p>In the last year I&#x27;ve visited a number of very well known modern art collections. Looking at the unbelievably epic size of the works...just huge canvases filled with random stuff the artists felt like throwing at it, or big squares or lines or whatever, and <i>massive</i> multi-ton sculptures that were basically the result of a masonry 101 class or intro to welding two pieces of scrap iron together class.<p>My only thought the entire time was that I was walking around a building composed of desperate cries for attention, &quot;look at me! look at me!&quot; each piece of screaming at me, but each showed me nothing of any particular note or interest.<p>I stopped and just started laughing when I got to the pile of flame retardant foam that had just been sprayed into a pile and delivered to the museum. Carefully noted and called out as a special work by the curator so I wouldn&#x27;t confuse it with an actual pile of leftover flame retardant foam from a previous fire or something.<p>Half of the works were indistinguishable from a pile of garbage or a bad renovation project.<p>And then I saw this <a href=""http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/4926/nampaikbuddha.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/4926/nampaikbuddha.jpg</a><p>and I stopped regretting the time I was wasting instantly. It was beautiful, elegant, evocative, it worked on many many levels. There&#x27;s not a lot to it. Somebody could probably set it up in 10 or 20 minutes. But it <i>means</i> something -- setting it up in the way it was provided all the context and meaning the work needed. It&#x27;s interpretive. It&#x27;s commentary. But it&#x27;s doing something other than trying to say &quot;look at me look at me! I&#x27;m art! I&#x27;m art!&quot; It works in and out of the context of an art museum...which is more than a 20&#x27;x40&#x27; canvas filled with string and cat feces can claim.<p>At another museum, I had the same feelings till I got to a special installation by Ryan McGuinness. It&#x27;s easy to dismiss McGuinness&#x27;s work as just a bunch of random clipart printed out on a large format printer. But what was expertly done with the installation was an overview of the process behind his work. And it was really breathtaking.<p>A single piece is the culmination of hundreds or thousands of hours of behind the scenes work, and a real attempt to connect his art with the context it&#x27;s placed in. And you realize as you walk through the process that there&#x27;s no other way that he could have really arrived at his pieces except through this excruciatingly detailed and exacting process. Once you see the process, you learn to &quot;see&quot; his work and it&#x27;s glorious and wonderful and exciting.<p>This sat in stark contrast to the many <i>many</i> other pieces of modern art I&#x27;ve tried to spend time understanding -- even going to entire classes of art appreciation. Where the more I learn about the artist and their process and the work, the less and less impressed I am with it.<p>During another visit, I met a local artist -- Matt Lively. And his thing is to paint bees on unicycles. That&#x27;s it. They&#x27;re usually done on small cuts of wood a few inches by a few inches, but sometimes on canvas. He&#x27;s not trying to produce the next great world changing art movement. He&#x27;s just making his little bees. And he could care less about what people thought about them.<p><i>&quot;I don’t have a lot of control over other people’s feelings,&quot; Matt describes. &quot;So, I rarely think about [how my art will affect viewers] when creating a show.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://rockettsvillage.com/blog/07/2012/cedar-works-gallery-showcases-art-by-matt-lively#sthash.NJLB9JBG.dpuf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rockettsvillage.com/blog/07/2012/cedar-works-gallery-...</a><p>He&#x27;s doing what he likes to do. It&#x27;s not high art, but it&#x27;s whimsical and <i>does</i> evoke an emotional feeling. And it&#x27;s I think it&#x27;s awesome. There&#x27;s room in my view of art for low to high-brow stuff.<p>What I don&#x27;t have room for in my view is stupid nonsense posing as art. I know 90% of everything is crap. And there&#x27;s lots of crap art out there. But I&#x27;d rather not be exposed to most of that 90% as if it was fantastic stuff I just didn&#x27;t get. I get it, people desperately want attention and to feel important. Well if you want that, do something worth my attention, do something actually important.<p>So when I say this flag stunt is a stupid juvenile prank, I&#x27;m saying it with lots of meaning and understanding of art behind the statement.",1407887922

It&#x27;s true that I am, intentionally, conflating automation and formalisation of mathematics, activities which can be meaningfully distinguished.  Is it to that that you object?<p>On the other hand, I think that it is also meaningful to point out that, although automation is just a version of human activity carried out by a computer, not all human activity is subject to automation—at least, not yet.  The two bad examples that spring to mind are chess-playing and facial recognition (bad because both have recently come into the reach of computers).<p>In principle, any human activity <i>that we understand</i> can be automated simply by giving a computer sufficiently precise instructions; but (1) if those instructions are too detailed and <i>ad hoc</i>, then it may be just as hard to give them as to carry out the task, and (2) there are many human activities that we do <i>not</i> understand.",1407887477
8170807,comment,8170326,8170754,1,0,icegreentea,,,"Well, stuff that you implicitly learn are things that you cannot &#x27;explain&#x27;. In the paper, they say they use sequence learning as their implicit learning task. In sequence learning, you show some visual stimuli, and the subject reacts. Depending on the test, the sequence may have underlying structure. I don&#x27;t have access to the paper, so I&#x27;m speculating here, but its probable that they used a test with underlying structure, and measured the reaction times of the subjects. This test essentially tests the subjects &#x27;subconscious&#x27; pattern recognition. And one of the hallmarks of implicit learning is that your skill is only weakly transferable to other skills. So it might be that only sequence learning is impaired by mindfullness. Who knows.<p>As for if implicit learning is &#x27;bad&#x27;? Well, it certainly depends on context. There are definitely large areas where it is preferable to have explicit knowledge. That said, there are also lots of situation where it simply isn&#x27;t feasible to get that explicit knowledge - we must fall back to implicit learning. For example, language learning is a pretty weird case. As children, language learning is pretty much mostly implicit - it is entirely possible to develop into a passable English speaker without being to articulate any of the grammer rules. Even as adults, we are often told to stop worrying about the rules, and just get exposure to the language - this too relates to implicit learning.",1407887447

Unless there&#x27;s secret non-volatile storage on Intel chips, there&#x27;s relatively little of value that you can do using a rogue microcode update.  This is because Intel chips reset to factory microcode when rebooted.<p>It&#x27;s plausible that a rogue microcode update could be used to bypass TPM static-root-of-trust protections, though, and a microcode update could certainly bypass TXT&#x27;s dynamic root of trust.  This might enable a bootable USB stick that would load malicious microcode and then reboot warmly enough to preserve the microcode and then launch the OS with a TXT bypass.<p>Even so, I don&#x27;t really see the point.

8170693,comment,8169672,8170295,3,0,codeflo,,,"> There are well-known approximation algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem, which is NP-hard<p>Actually, it&#x27;s either not NP-hard, or not approximable, depending on your definition of TSP. Let me clarify.<p>TSP, as most people define it, means &quot;given a graph, find the shortest roundtrip&quot;. As you rightly state, this problem can be well approximated. But it&#x27;s not a <i>decision problem</i> (it doesn&#x27;t have a yes/no answer), and thus doesn&#x27;t even fit into categories like &quot;NP&quot; or &quot;NP-complete&quot;. Talking about the NP-completess of this &quot;Optimization TSP&quot; is essentially a type error.<p>It&#x27;s only when we define a &quot;Decision TSP&quot; problem that we can talk about things like NP-hardness. For example, we might ask &quot;Given a graph and a number c, is there a roundtrip of length less than c?&quot;. And this new problem <i>is</i> NP-hard. Given any problem in NP, like a SAT instance for example, we can efficiently construct a (usually very contrived) graph that will have a roundtrip of a certain length if and only the original SAT instance is satisfiable.<p>But unlike &quot;Optimization TSP&quot;, this &quot;Decision TSP&quot; can&#x27;t be approximated. It doesn&#x27;t even make sense to talk about approximations: a roundtrip of length < c can&#x27;t &quot;almost exist&quot;, the answer is always either yes or no. And while an exact solution for Optimization TSP can trivially answer Decision TSP, any <i>approximation</i> of Optimization TSP is essentially useless in solving Decision TSP.<p>That&#x27;s why TSP (in its optimization form) can be easy to approximate, while also (in its decision form) being NP-hard.",1407885144

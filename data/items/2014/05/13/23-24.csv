7741360,comment,7739872,7741051,6,0,beloch,,,"One of the cornerstones of selective breeding is systematic <i>inbreeding</i>.  This brings out recessive traits and encourages the accumulation of what we would normally consider mutations and errors.  By selecting individuals that have desired traits, this engine of change is harnessed to produce the desired end results.<p>Consider how we would view humans who had been selectively bred long enough to change their form as drastically as some dog breeds have been changed! We would be <i>horrified</i> by them.  However, the deformities accumulated by this population, when reunited with a larger population, would soon disappear.  No doubt we would would view this as repairing the damage done to their genomes.<p>As for breeding dogs with the ability to sniff cancer... First, you have to get your hands on the raw materials. i.e. Find dogs who already can smell the stuff.  Then you have to hope at least some of their offspring will have that trait. Next, you need to figure out how to reliably train dogs with the ability to smell cancer to actually do so and communicate the results, and you&#x27;re probably going to have to do this with dogs you don&#x27;t necessarily know actually have the ability.  Also, you will need to be around people with cancer on a routine basis so you can test/teach your dogs.  I&#x27;d be willing to bet few oncologists will say things to their patients like, &quot;Gee, you&#x27;re absolutely riddled with cancer! How would you like to help out with our cancer-sniffing-dog breeding program before you snuff it?&quot;.  Finally, you have decades or even centuries of work ahead of you before you&#x27;ll have a breed on your hands with greater ability than random gifted individuals in the greater dog population.<p>The fact that some dogs can smell at least some forms of cancer suggests that there is a mechanism for detecting cancer to be discovered.  It would be much faster and far more useful to determine how dogs detect cancer and develop instruments directly based on that method.  The state of modern science is such that breeding animals just takes too long.",1400025510

His skill was in understanding how people thought and how to manipulate them.<p>So it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that he said that to a room full of young wantrepreneurs ready to kill themselves working 100-hour weeks in hopes of an acquihire (probably by Facebook). It also doesn&#x27;t surprise me that he blew $100 million on the good cause of helping his home school district -- looked great in the press and continued the narrative he wanted for himself. It manipulates large numbers of people in a way he wants them manipulated. This is his medium.<p>I wish him the best -- and that maybe he learns a little bit. I know that probably sounds condescending, but Zuck is at a huge disadvantage compared to the rest of us, similar to that disadvantage faced by rockstars: he&#x27;s at the top of his game. The job has to be a killer, but as far as <i>social feedback</i> goes, he&#x27;s unlikely to screw it up. When I was 25, if I went in and told my boss he was an idiot, I would lose my job. People would ask me what my problem was, and I&#x27;d have a good chance to do some introspection. He has no similar natural social limitations.

Most of the necessary semantics can be expressed as a function call. Figure out what JS values are live across the transition point, and pass them as arguments to a function call which transitions to the interpreter, which proceeds using those values. That can be done without any changes to LLVM, although obviously the code patching can&#x27;t, and its more efficient not to require values to be shuffled into argument registers.

Optionally, build a &quot;Github Resume&quot; of the code that forms the basis of those articles, and link to it.<p>5. Start asking friends and acquaintances if they know people who have problems that could be solved well with software development; be forward once you find prospective clients, and, after establishing bona fides (for instance, suggest a 15 minute conversation about their problems and <i>actually provide free advice</i>), follow up by <i>asking for the sale</i>; you have nothing to lose --- &quot;no&quot; is a perfectly fine answer.<p>You&#x27;ll do better long term executing this plan than you will on oDesk.",1400024112

Given their constraints I think they did a great job.<p>[1] Edit: I&#x27;ve been informed that the fast path in JSC is around this for pulling a bin off the free list. I should be more precise: what I mean is that you can stay on the fast path more often. You can always allocate very quickly, only falling off the fast path if the nursery fills up. Of course, falling off a malloc fast path is rare anyhow, so this isn&#x27;t likely to be that much of a difference in practice…",1400022738
7741192,comment,7740925,7740925,4,0,tomp,,,"They use a conservative GC, which I understand, as they were using it before FTL JIT, and it required minimal changes for integration with LLVM-based JIT. However, in the blog post, they mention several times that they wanted to avoid stack maps because that would require spilling pointers from registers to stack, which they say is undesirable for performance reasons.<p>I wonder, however, how slow register spilling really is. I will test it when I have time, but logically, it shouldn&#x27;t take up much time. Under the x64 ABI, 6 registers are used for argument passing [1], and the rest of the arguments are passed on the stack. So, when the runtime calls into GC functions, all but at most 6 pointers are already in the stack, at (in theory) predictable locations. Those 6 registers can be pushed to stack in 6 instructions that take up 8 bytes [2], so the impact on the code size should be minimal, and performance is probably also much faster than most other memory accesses. Furthermore, both OCaml and Haskell use register spilling, and while not quite at C-like speeds, they are mostly faster than JS engines and probably also faster than FTL JIT.<p>Of course, predicting the stack map after LLVM finishes its optimisations is another thing entirely, but I sincerely hope the developers implement it. EDIT: it seems that LLVM includes some features [3] that allow one to create a stack map, though I wonder if it can be made as efficient as the GHC stack map, which is simply a bitmap/pointer in each stack frame, identifying which words in the frame are pointers and which aren&#x27;t.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#x86-64_calling_conventions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#x86-64_...</a><p>[2] tested using <a href=""https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm#disassembly"" rel=""nofollow"">https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm#disassembly</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://llvm.org/docs/GarbageCollection.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llvm.org/docs/GarbageCollection.html</a>",1400022691

I guess what I meant to say was that for alot of organizations it seems to be useless paradigm gibberish.<p>For our organization it doesn&#x27;t seem to be, and my purely unscientific observation would be that getting devs on board is more about tools and channeling them through a process. That, you can get someone through pretty quick because its primarily logistics based.<p>We have tickets that are tied to pull requests you have to submit your PRs for test tickets before you can submit your PRs for feature tickets we have a CI server that will run those PR&#x27;s against the tests at which point we merge everything.<p>This makes it pretty straight forward how development has to get done.<p>Where as, getting people who aren&#x27;t code driven on-board requires complex paradigm adoption about how we design projects and road-map the business. Some of these people end up at these types of trainings because they are the people who need the indoctrination the most.<p>Developers we have faced have a tendency to either just sort of shrug and go &quot;ok&quot; or to want to totally fight the system and tear it down and replace it with X. We do our best to weed the violent opposition types by using test writing as examples during interviews the violent opposition types usually get visibly frustrated by the &quot;test then code&quot; approach of TDD so we haven&#x27;t had to much trouble identifying people like this.<p>The long and short would be:<p>I think that the thesis of the OP that lack of dev&#x27;s is a problem can be rejected because engineering unit employees don&#x27;t face the same hill climb to adoption that business unit employees do and that this has been enabled by the fact that:<p>developers have at this point written them selves tools to automate their own side of the paradigm... i.e Jira Github and so on",1400022336

4941195,comment,4937691,4937691,1,0,biturd,,,"Why can't we go back to the days of modems. It seems to be the only potentially accessible set of wires that any company can hook into without permission, regulation, permits, etc.<p>Most homes have at least 2 pair wiring, most modern homes have 4 pair. So minimum is 4 wires and maximum is 8. Even on a 2 wire half duplex Ethernet connection you should get pretty good speeds compared to DSL and especially 56k. Yes, lots of collisions but hopefully most opt for the 4 wire 2 pair connection.<p>Instead of a 56k modem we would have to create an Ethernet modem. What is the technical limitation that prevents this from happening? Being able to have ""Ethernet Dialup"" so to speak? If I have 4 pairs on one end I should be able to connect up to some telco and get access.<p>In thinking about this, that does mean the cost of having 4 data lines turned on. But I had a data line dropped into a colocation cabinet for 9.99 a month. For around 40.00 a month maximum a home should be able to be lit up. At just the prices Amazon advertises for S3 storage and that's transit and storage add another 10.00 a month and I have plenty of bandwidth. Though I would hope to actually pay wholesale pricing getting costs down even lower. It should be possible to profit 20.00 or so off each user. Throw in a one time fee for the Ethernet router and you should be making money. With potential for gigabit speeds.<p>The only thing I can think is how do you deal with the line length limitations of Ethernet runs inherent to that technology itself. I'm hoping there's something out there. They have been slowly pushing DSL to faster speeds, or is DSL++ or DSL2 or whatever it's called essentially what I'm talking about?<p>Maybe this all comes down to the 100 meter limit for Ethernet runs and how impossible it would be to put repeaters or hubs every 100 meters.<p>It just seems that the wire is there, why not use it? In 5 years when no one has a landline are we really going to have millions of telephone poles scattered around with wire on them that does nothing? Grated we use the poles for other things like power but it just seems strange that there will be all this copper just sitting around. I guess then it's time for the mass copper recycling project to get underway.",1355892584
4941194,comment,4940022,4940907,4,0,agorabinary,,,"I could not agree more. I wonder how much of the SV environment is created from the trickle down investments of legitimately good ideas --- that is, a Facebook spawning thousands of millionaires, some of which happen to invest in their brother's friend's silly idea not out of any rational analysis, but from just being young and stupid and lucky enough to grab up a few early FB shares.<p>Furthermore, consider the difference in building a startup and building a typical brick and mortar business. Think of how simple the thought was to create a social network where users choose friends to create a distinct social circle. Or Drew Houston allegedly conceiving of Dropbox by repeatedly forgetting his USB drive in college. Very many SV startups build themselves off of some eureka moment that, being based on the internet, requires minimal investment, effort, connections, and reputation to establish early stage. Then, as long as it is a good idea, investment and employees flood in. Compare this to the enormous barriers of entry extant in a traditional brick and mortar with the bank loans and industry connections and disparate business resources, and combined with a barely-out-of-college aged potential CEO with or without good ideas. You get two entirely different standards of discrimination. It almost seems sometimes like SV considers bad ideas as a normal state of affairs, as a ""learning experience"" to future brilliance. Fail to succeed? Most successful startup founders hit it right on their debut--- why? Because they have a mentality of, ""Should I do this?"", and not merely, ""Can I do this?"".<p>I'm not saying low barriers to entry are necessarily a bad thing. It just seems like either there are one, a lot of fools with grand visions or two, ulterior-minded entrepreneurs looking to pad their resume or impress their friends with some social networking rip-off that only cost them $10k to build. Bustling, metropolitan environments often offer that billion dollar jackpot or Hollywood walk of fame, but require in turn a more demanding degree of discrimination to tell that shiny metal from mere fool's gold.",1355892581

I already am planning on going to a few meetup events, tech talks, developer meetings, etc.<p>I am still staying out here for another 5 weeks, and I cannot nearly fill up all of that time with these meetups. In addition to exploring SF, I want to make this trip productive. I want to learn as much as possible about development, because where I am from, the industry doesn't exist. I am willing to get my hands dirty on whatever, whether it is mobile development, front end and design, or backend database stuff.

You're both somewhere between half correct and entirely correct.<p>> Quit blaming the economy.<p>> With enough determination and will, you will find a way. Or you will make one.<p>You seem awfully certain of that. I can't help but wonder if this view derives primarily from confirmation bias or if it represents an accurate appraisal of the market. I think your conclusion holds with regard to the tech sector (most of us probably do) but I'm much less convinced that it generalizes. There's no cosmic entity guaranteeing that ""a way"" is present, only the economy. It's pointless to argue over the particular combination of self-reliant traits and opportunity that leads to success, but ignoring the correlation between the economy, opportunity, and success, is obnoxious and leads to short-sighted and self-serving policy positions.<p>> it has taken talent, drive, hard work, and sacrifice to capitalize on the opportunity presented to me.<p>See, here's the problem: there's a positive feedback loop between opportunity and success and down at the ""no success"" (poor) end of the spectrum the availability of opportunity is strongly determined by the economy. Talent takes time and resources to develop, drive takes resources to exploit, and hard work has no inherent value. You can't capitalize on something you you don't have. For the poor, acquiring resources means having a job, and it's possible for the conditions around that to be shitty enough to inhibit progress along self-determined directions even for the most driven of individuals. Nobody would argue that Chinese wage-slaves or starving African children are simply failing to capitalize on readily available opportunities. For less extreme examples of opportunity deprivation, less extreme conclusions still hold.<p>Just because the tech sector is in a fairly rosy position right now doesn't mean we should bury our heads in the sand and pretend like our victories are due to ""superiority of drive"" or ""understanding of value"". We should fight to increase the amount of opportunity available to society's poorest members. Sometimes this means offering resources necessary for ""bootstrapping"". Other times it means chopping down barriers to entry by punishing anti-competitive and monopolistic behavior. I don't believe our society does nearly enough of either.<p>I know that your post wasn't advocating a political position and was instead observing that a certain attitude is best for self-development.

Since this announcement and my feeling of total abandonment from Google for the ""small guys"" I started investigating. MICROSOFT DOES THIS VERY WELL!!!. Now, that being said, it isn't exactly as polished as the Google Apps experience but the Microsoft re-work of its web mail is great. A quick search will give some good reviews. So...what is a guy to do?...well... you simply go to domains.live.com, go through the registration process. Once complete you will have access the the Admin Center. You then administrate your domain email as you would have in Google Apps. Again, it will be the current Microsoft way BUT it works well. I just did it for a photographer (yep...small business). It works perfectly. Once you register for the Admin Center, you can administrate MULTIPLE domains from YOUR one Admin Center. Also, Microsoft is MUCH more generous with the number of user accounts you can create for your domain...Up to 500 at last count. Naturally it also comes with Calendar, SkyDrive, etc. They give you all of the DNS records you need. Also, once you set it all up...if you go to Outlook.com directly and sign in with your personal domain email address/account, it will do so for you always (if you use the Microsoft DNS records for email---> like mail.yourdomain.com) Otherwise you will initially get the Hotmail interface. Again, a quick search will yield articles for changing to the NEW Outlook.com interface.

Its your life and you have to make smart decisions. Its not a game, where you can just shrug it off as a mistake, blame the government and then expect something miraculous to happen.<p>Looking back, I can tell you about my own experiences here in India. When I opted to study engineering and before that science for my pre-university college, there were a lot of friends of mine who wanted to study history or commerce because it was 'easy'. Really, you have whole life to live on that and you take a wrong decision just because you want it easy for the next 4 years?<p>Now after 4-5 years when we were all looking for jobs, the very same people who consciously studied history and commerce complained that either had no jobs or jobs that payed very poorly. Most of them either ended either being clerks(where their jobs are constantly threatened by automation) or working at call enters. And again you see the same government blaming. How can the government or people around you help if you make wrong decisions all over the years?<p>And not surprisingly it turns out most of such people are generally the kind of guys who don't very hard and are always looking for short cuts.

It is not aimed at alleviating an undue burden of identifying commercial content (as Instagram might suggest), it's about reducing transparency to allow for marketing tactics that would not likely be viewed favorably if they were obvious to the user.  While under no legal obligation to do so, Google has been identifying sponsored content for over a decade.  If we were to begin by looking at ""standard practice"" then we might start there.<p>I think it's great that people are reading TOS from web companies and making their concerns known.   We might call this negotiation.  If you accept that idea, then I think users are in an excellent bargaining position.  They can walk away at any time.  They can adapt and they can find new alternatives.  These companies however may not be able to find new audiences so easily.  I believe they will take the feedback very seriously and respond, with new language if necessary.<p>I'm noticing some of my friends on Facebook who were using it extensively for one purpose or another are now closing their accounts.

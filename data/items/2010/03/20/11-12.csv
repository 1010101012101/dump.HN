""Well Bob, the code is actually in the box -- and it's not. In this universe? Sure it's buggy as hell. But let me assure you, there are many other universes in which the code is kicking ass, and you are very happy. Actually the code was perfectly fine here too -- until you looked at it.""<p>(I know I'm using hyperbole. The point is that quantum effects make normal people's brain hurt)",1269085802

1206313,comment,1205163,1205163,0,0,tetha,,,"Hm. I think, one could condense the argumentation as follows: Number of Unit tests = c * (Complexity * Use Cases + State-Tests) for some constant c, if Complexity is a measure of the interface complexity, use cases is the number of use cases of the API and state-tests is the number of tests required due to statefulness of the API.<p>I think, this approximation is at least not wrong. I don't know if the characterization is complete, but it looks right enough to fool me :)<p>However, I think the problem in the argumentation is that the author assumes that ""use cases"" is small. While I agree, that usually, the number of use cases for an API should be small, there certainly are abstractions with a lot of use cases which are good even though they require a lot of unit tests.<p>An example of such a big abstraction is something I developed in the recent university project. Basically, it is a domain specific language which is compiled into state machines on partial bit sequences (which are used to describe data deserializers). The major job of this abstraction can be described in a few formulas and the abstraction hides enough complexity to be worth it, but it requires quite a large number of unit tests due to the number of possible edge cases in the specification of the DSL. Thus, at least I'd consider it a good abstraction in spite of needing many unit tests.",1269085359

1206304,story,,,4,3,ovsd,"Ask HN: Online Video Speed Dating through Facebook",,"Sorry to bother you with an idea (I know, execution is everything...) but I'm just to exited right now and would love to get some feedback.<p>Idea is simple and obyiously inspired by chatroulette, faceroulette. Online video speed dating but not with totally random persons (like chatroulette) but filtered through facebook (just opposite/same sex, selected country, age, town, interests... ). If it seems boring, you just click next and after every chat you can select if you would like to become ""real"" facebook friends (if both click that option). You could also mark/report people to keep the number of trools/perverts even lower. Of course you could also choose to just chat and explicit choose that it's not about datin and focus more on same interests...<p>I have never used a dating or even a chat site, but I can see myself using this.<p>Business model tbd but that might be something people want, or?<p>Besides, I know that people probably already working on this but I'm not convinced yet, that it couldn't be done better (the current faceroulette and chatroulette are definately not what I am loking for)<p>FYI:I'm not a programmer and won't be able to do it myself, so if this inspires anyone please go for it.",1269083934

1206302,comment,1204505,1204505,0,0,roundsquare,,,"I think the author is missing two big points.  The first is that, for people currently in their 20's (and probably a bit older/younger as well) jazz was something their parents enjoyed a lot.  In the US, there is an strong tendency to dislike whatever our parents like, so from a young age jazz is automatically crossed off, and that carries over as we get older.<p>Second, if his argument was correct, Americans would generally require some kind of lyrical coherence to enjoy music.  If each sentence in a song were completely disconnected from the previous sentences we wouldn't enjoy it.  However, witness the popularity of DJ Girl Talk[1].  From a lyrical point of view, its only fairly connected.  Of course, Americans will generally recognize the lyrics and that may offset my point to some degree, but I'm not convinced it does.  (FWIW, I only recently found DJ Girl Talk and have become obsessed, so take that for what its worth).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=05DBB3473E2A7D56"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=05DBB3473E2A7D56</a>",1269083651

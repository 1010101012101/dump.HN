I'd like to see trends on growth in the UK as well, across demographics.<p>Another note: banning a site in hopes that your employees will be more productive is a waste of time (pun intended). Wasting time on social networks while at work is a symptom of a bigger problem.",1185749991

37510,comment,37335,37335,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"There is a huge confusion in this article. It tries to equate distributed innovation (""democratized"") with government mandated research into things like stem cells (also ""democratized"" in the literal sense of mandated by a democratic government). <p>That doesn't even make any sense, to confuse the two.<p>I have to agree with another comment about finding generalizations where there are none. Painting with a rather broad brush: all technologies are developed by elite teams top-down or distributed.<p>What about elite, distributed teams? Yah-know -- like the set of all startups :-P",1185748974

The hardware at their end would be a simple DSL/Cable modem hooked up through a small form factor unix box with a wireless card in it and a fairly anal set of firewall rules to prevent deep abuse.<p>The business model was to be setting up in line ad replacement on websites with a focus on local businesses.  You're sitting in the coffee shop and an ad comes up for 10% off your next purchase at the book store across the corner, or a two for one this day only at the diner down the street.<p>I was working at Telus (big canadian telecom) at the time and they had just started cracking down on employees running side businesses that crossed over their product and service lines.  I would've been fired and sued if I would've started it up, too broke to do it alone, and didn't have a clue where to go for investors or the like.  I'm still tempted to do this, but free wireless has spread so much it would be hard to penetrate the market and convince people my way was the best way.<p>I regret not having the balls to say that three months living expenses was good enough, lets make a prototype and get a test going and pray I can find some business minded investors in time.",1185748308

3526234,comment,3525477,3525477,3,0,pizza,,,"Ritalin (methylphenidate) and Adderall (Dextroamphetamine / Levoamphetamine) are interesting and powerful nootropics (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic</a>). I haven't tried them yet, although I am looking forward to the day I do. However, they do have some serious negative aspects; they are addictive and come with a substantial 'crash'. This is where the racetams come in!<p>The racetam family consists of nootropics that enhance mainly memory recall, although I certainly feel there's an increase in ability to think of new ideas and convey them lucidly. They're not all that new (first developed in the 60s) and are widely regarded as non-toxic, in both the short and long term (sorry, don't know how to find the study. However, as anecdotal evidence, this guy did 80 GRAMS of piracetam in one sitting, which is 100x the regular dose <a href=""http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=153468"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=153468</a>).<p>The stimulation from piracetam, the racetam that is most commonly used, is sort of similar to caffeine stimulation but less pronounced; I have also never experienced a piracetam crash, even after nasal insufflation of a gram and a half. Piracetam also makes me much more productive, much more than caffeine ever did or probably will ever do, and I highly suggest it for anyone who is interested in nootropics!",1327870712

In fact, I had that idea before they did, but I didn't want to require the user to put the phone on the bed.  That seemed really kludgy to me, so that's why I continued on my original path of embedding the motion sensor in the charging dock.

It works, but from what I hear it's limiting their pipeline quite a bit. But then, they're Weta so they're more than capable of writing their own stuff and they're good at what they do :)<p>ILM used to do something similar, but a lot of the big houses are moving from PRMan over to raytracers (specifically Arnold) with full GI support as it makes the overall pipeline and definitely artist look-dev a lot simpler and faster.

3526220,comment,3525477,3525644,9,0,tripzilch,,,"I tried a few sessions of bio-feedback but quit because I got frustrated by it and not being worth the time and money.<p>During the intake the therapist described Ritalin as ""poison"". I should have probably gotten up and left right there. If you have the opinion that Ritalin is overprescribed, or that it should not be given to small children, that's all fine with me. But ""poison"" has a pretty clear definition, you'll find that whenever someone refers to a drug as ""poison"", you're dealing with pseudo-scientific quackery.<p>What made me quit was mostly that I couldn't find any correlation between the signals received from the electrodes and my own state of consciousness, be it more relaxed or more concentrated or alpha/beta waved, whatever.<p>When I watched the graphs on the monitor, I noticed a few things. There is a LOT of noise. If I'd clench my jaw, move a muscle in my neck, my ears, whatever, it'd cause an avalanche of noise, completely drowning out any possible brain signal. Ok so you sit still, you're meant to focus or relax anyhow. Except that muscles just seem to generate a whole lot more electrical signal than your brain, and every time I even <i>blinked my eye</i> there was a burst of noise (probably also because the eye muscle is relatively close to the electrodes). The software did nothing to filter out these noise-bursts, even though it'd have been trivial to make at least a basic attempt that would throw away the data during a burst so the other filters wouldn't trigger.<p>Ah, the <i>other</i> filters. Well, it quickly became clear I knew a lot more about DSP than this guy. He had no idea how his device operated, at least not how the signals were transformed into whatever was displayed on the screen. There's not really an excuse for this. Sure enough a surgeon might not know about the algorithms used to convert an MRI scan into a picture, but the radiologist <i>does</i> (at least, on some level), which is why we have radiologists.<p>So you know about these alpha/beta/theta/gamma brain waves right? They're at 12/10/7/3 Hz frequencies or something like that. Now I always had the idea that by this they meant some fundamental Eigen-frequency of signals in the brain, so you'd <i>think</i> to apply some auto-correlation to determine the base frequency and its harmonics. But instead he had a bunch of bandpass filters running concurrently being graphed through some ancient MS-DOS program with obvious leakage from one band to another and we were looking at the raw filtered signal, not even its energy and as I said there was <i>no</i> noise suppression.<p>I'd have loved to take that device home, write some code for it and see what it could detect though. Hell, even detecting muscle movements is already way cool :)<p>Anyway, no correspondence between my state of focus or relaxation.<p>Staring at a computer screen (with a game, usually one frequency band was used to control a game of some sort) for 1-2 hours per week, actively trying to relax or focus would definitely have a result of course.<p>Which is why I'm doing a universal yoga meditation class. Dunno if it helps with the ADD, but it can't hurt and it definitely has some other advantages (notably: posture and stress/tension). One thing I do notice, yoga works best if I haven't taken meds that day. You'd think it improves focus, but this yoga class is mainly being able to really feel your whole body and muscles should not be tense for that, but on meds I find I get way more fidgety and subconsciously re-tense every muscle I relax as my focus shifts to the next part of my body. Fortunately, noticing and being aware of such subtle effects in your body is exactly what the class it about :-)",1327870288

Packages past a certain threshold get the choice to become a main repository package. Creating and maintaining community packages is a snap with their build system (though I've never done it personally, but understand the mechanism).<p>On top of that, re-building your kernel, should you ever need to (I did), is dead simple.<p>So to your main argument of more compromise, I believe it to be false. It's less compromise to me. I feel I have to compromise with an Ubuntu distro that has made all the choices for me (and for a client-services company at least, you'll come to the day where you need to know what those choices were).

3526189,comment,3525659,3525747,15,0,tony_vivaldi,,,"I was laid off a year ago at age 37 and have not been able to get a job since, or even get many interviews. I think at this point I've applied to 77 jobs, heard back from 11, and have actually been phone screened by 5.<p>Most of my experience is in relatively ""hot"" technology at startups... I have three Rails sites I can point to and worked on an iPhone app with 3 million users, with a node.js and Redis backend. I have a github account. I've solved programming challenges from Facebook, interview street, spotify, etc. I don't think I'm a total slouch, and I've worked with guys FAR worse than I am. It's pretty painful to think about some of the duds that are still employed while I can't even get an interview.<p>People prescribe keeping skills relevant, but focusing on latest technologies can be a mistake. If I had more experience with Microsoft tech or J2EE I could probably pick up a boring job doing enterprise stuff somewhere in the midwest.<p>I thought I could always just pick up a job through my network, but a lot of guys my age who were friends at other companies are sort of checked out and are not in a position to hire. The younger guys I met I think just don't want to pull me in because they have plenty of younger friends they could hire first. A lot of tech hiring, especially at the startup level, is hiring guys that you want to be bros with. Generally, you aren't bros with guys 10 or 15 years older than you are.<p>I never thought I'd be one of the guys in the articles like this, so I'm not sure exactly what to do. I've been working on iPhone apps in my spare time, but at some point I am going to run out of money. It can get very depressing and does quite a number on one's mental health. You feel like you can't socialize because you should be looking for work, and not spending money. Your extended family and friends kind of abandon you because they think something must be wrong with you (maybe there is?). This anxiety and isolation makes it pretty hard to focus and I've been considering trying anti-depressant medications, just so I can finish off my apps. However, I have diminished confidence at this point that having finished iPhone apps will get me any money, or another job. I often feel like I should just stop wasting my time and try to get some sort of dangerous but high paying labor job, like an oil roughneck. Or maybe just move to some cheap developing nation and become some sort of ex-pat weirdo guy?<p>Another aspect of this, is that it seems kind of weird to even get a job stocking shelves at target, or something. Would they even hire me? Would it be worth it to make the 1400 a month?<p>I now have a lot of sympathy for the ""99%"" type people. Those Seth Godin and Friedman pieces about the new economy being no place for average workers are pretty much correct. I wouldn't say I'm a C player but I'd say I'm around a B+. Unfortunately, B+ and 35 or above computer programmer doesn't seem to cut it.<p>P.S. if anyone has any advice it would be pretty helpful to me and maybe others",1327869735

The Fermis are better, but Intel's branch predictors are very good.<p>SSE and AVX can also more than quadruple the throughput of CPUs in the best of cases.<p>Also, a typical VFX feature film scene can have up to 200GB of geometry and 100 GB of textures, and this is before acceleration structures, deformation motion blur caches and texture mip-maps have been created.<p>Transferring that amount of data through the PCI-E bus isn't worth it at the moment, especially given the limit of 6GB of onboard VRAM that would mean huge amounts of swapping.<p>Also, GPUs use even more power and produce even more heat than CPUs, so you don't save anything here.",1327868918

In my view, there's not a huge difference between parsing HQL into a tokenized structure, versus building the tokenized structure directly using a generative system like `query(class).filter(class.foo=='bar')`.   They do also have a slightly more DSL-like thing called ""criteria"" queries, which are of the ""criteria.add(Restrictions.like(""name"", ""ed""))"" variety, a far cry from linq though.<p>But an ORM is about a lot more than just building SELECT queries.  Hibernate has a Session (SQLAlchemy copied this name from Hibernate), built on top of similar unit of work/identity map patterns - it also uses pretty much the same notion of transaction integration (that is, flush() any number of times in a transaction, including before queries, then commit() at the end).    SQLAlchemy originally copied the name for their ""save_or_update()"" method, until taking a cue from Storm and renaming it to ""add()"".   The merge() method in SQLAlchemy is directly from Hibernate, to the point where I read its source to determine its exact behavior in some edge cases.<p>The notion of ""cascades"" and the options it accepts are almost identical to Hibernate.  There's the fact that collections are represented persistently in memory once loaded, rather than doing a ""load on every iteration"" kind of pattern that it appears all the other Python ORMs do, as this was the pattern that seemed more familiar to me as well as a lot more efficient in a majority of cases.<p>Collection loading via joins or a second query that loads for a full set of parent objects at once is pretty much inspired from Hibernate, though I sought to dramatically improve Hibernate's behavior here by getting ""joined eager loading"" to work totally transparently, including if the parent query had LIMIT/OFFSET on it.<p>Originally we had also copied this Hibernate concept called ""entity name mappings"" until realizing it was a terrible idea not at all relevant to Python.    The horizontal sharding extension, which I've always viewed as just a proof of concept/experimental thing, was designed pretty much verbatim from Hibernate's similarly little-used API...people were really bugging me for a transparent, horizontal sharding system for awhile, even though they still seem unwise to me, so I figured copying their idea was better than just totally guessing how to do it.<p>Overall, SQLAlchemy can be seen as a product largely derived from Hibernate in Java and SQLObject in Python, rounded out with various patterns in ""Patterns of Enterprise Architecture"", and later on from the Storm ORM as well.",1327868916

I'm eager to (and do) maintain my skills, and really don't see myself morphing into the old fuddy-duddy (completely not my nature, and even my youngest colleagues agree).<p>That said, there are some significant life-style challenges that work against simply keeping one's skills sharp.  Out of college I wanted to change the world, had all to gain and nothing to lose, just moved and had no family obligations, was surrounded by likewise eager entrepreneurs who were plugged into technology, and I could spend all day and night burrowing into whatever the latest thing was. In short, I could easily commit the vast amount of my time to tech and was naturally on top of things.<p>Not so today! Wife, kids, and a mortgage means drastically reduced time for such endeavors, and a much greater responsibility to provide a stable income (hopefully with benefits too). Add to that, I'm  not hanging out in bars after work surrounded by other sources of tech insight, which was always a great way to learn of new things and get a feel for where things are heading. Instead, I'm heading home, because there are a lot of non-tech things to take care of.<p>This doesn't mean I throw in the towel. I carve out time where I can and work my ass off to stay abreast of changing technology, including working on side projects for more real-world practice. I burn some of my much-valued vacation time to get to a conference each year. And I'm cool with the way things are going. But I'm also realistic... Am I going to be burning whole weekends in 48 hour hackathons? Not likely, and least in my situation. I had to come to terms with the fact that I couldn't emulate the behavior of an early 20's developer in Silicon Valley. But I can do things that I think keep me reasonably useful to employers. Most important: this is not at all due to age, but rather due to life circumstances that often come with getting older.<p>When I'm 45 or 50, I will not be the genius who is cranking out the next Node.js in a weekend, but I highly doubt I'll be sitting at city hall waiting for f*cking Promatch to find me a job either.",1327868514

The signs of a death march are different from those who are working hard because they're excited about what they're doing.<p>Death marches usually happen because shared suffering becomes more important than creativity and insight. You might notice that this is how a lot of organizations run. Poor managerial or group performance leads to more of a sense of urgency, which means that one needs to suffer and sacrifice even more in order to keep up with the group. Eventually, there's a lot of effort but minimal effectiveness and group performance goes from transiently weak to objectively bad.<p>Some death march signs:<p>* People feeling they ""have to"" spend unusually long hours in the office.\n* People coming to work when sick. \n* Hard deadlines on short timeframes (i.e. the 4:30 work drop).\n* Low employee autonomy on what is done and how. \n* Full-time workers dedicated to maintenance efforts (instead of maintenance being a minor chore shared by the group). \n* Wide disparities in measured performance: one or two people being ""manic"" and generating 1000 LoC/week, with the rest of the team struggling to keep up with their changes. \n* Lots of moving targets, scope and feature creep, and unstable interfaces that come from sudden unnecessary couplings (premature optimization).<p>Older people (as a group) don't have a ""can't do"" attitude. They just know the signs of a death march and they know what it's like to burn out, and they're not going to commit 120% until they <i>know</i> their efforts are going to pan out. That said, they shouldn't be <i>required</i> to commit 120 percent. You get 40 hours, minus whatever you take away in meetings and such.

3526052,comment,3525744,3525744,61,0,ChristianMarks,,,"I've built one for ~ $30 in parts from Radio Shack using an LM317 current limiter. There is an odd bootstrapping problem involved with tDCS devices: you need to have the device connected to comprehend the instructions! Researchers speak of anodal and cathodal stimulation, and the convention is that + is anodal and - is cathodal. So far so good--at least this comports with vacuum tube conventions, which will be familiar to all readers of Hacker News. Researchers speak of anodal stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The tDCS device has to be connected (with the positive connection over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortext) to even begin to comprehend  that left means left from the perspective of the subject, but right from the perspective of a viewer viewing the subject's face. The right negative contact can go over the right eyebrow (but there are other protocols). This is one of the clearest: <a href=""http://www.ncrrn.org/papers/symposium_tdcs/hamilton_tdcs.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncrrn.org/papers/symposium_tdcs/hamilton_tdcs.pdf</a>.<p>As you can see, there is an inviolable convention among researchers not to unambiguously mark the anode + contact on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the cathode - contact over the subject's right eyebrow. Instead, what we see on the third slide is a cartoon drawing of a subject in which two contacts are labeled ""active"" and ""reference"". There is an arrow leading from the active contact to the reference contact labeled ""anodal"" and another arrow from the reference contact labeled ""cathodal"". This refers to an ancient convention in electronics, in which current was assumed to flow from the anode to the cathode, even though electrons flow from the cathode to the anode. The literature is replete with such helpful diagrams. One would like a completely unambiguous statement: the anode is the positive connection, and it is secured to the left side of the subject's scalp; the cathode is the negative connection, and it secured over the subject's right eyebrow. Or one of the eight combinations possible by arbitrarily switching anode with cathode, positive with negative, and left with right. But I have been unable to locate a statement in the literature that would condescend to so direct and simple a description.<p>Here is another article with a diagram showing node placement for tDCS. <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165017306001068"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165017306...</a>. Note that the anode is placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the cathode is placed on the forehead. That beats the anodal and cathodal arrows of the previous diagram. What we still don't have is the identification of + with anodal and - with cathodal. And so one must continue searching through the literature--which should be done in any case--until one comes to something approximating a consensus on node placement and the meaning of anodal and cathodal versus positive and negative.<p>Finally, here's a compilation from a less than unimpeachable source: <a href=""http://www.drmueller-healthpsychology.com/tDCS.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drmueller-healthpsychology.com/tDCS.html</a>.\nThe author misreads 1mA as one microamp. That's one milliamp. But we do get a straightforward statement about node placement from Fregni, F., Boggio, P., Nitsche, M., et al. (2006). Letters to the Editor: Treatment of major depression with transcranial direct current stimulation. Bipolar Disorders, 8:203-205. This is confirmed in <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22031874"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22031874</a>, though you have to know that anode means positive and cathode means negative.<p>I should say that in my initial reckless period of self-experimentation, I managed to induce phosphenes by accident -- blue white flashes in the entire visual field, blanking out everything else. Both contacts were in the supraorbital region. I ceased my experiments for a while and returned to the literature.",1327867694

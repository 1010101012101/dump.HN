Oh and writing &quot;Micro$oft&quot; was popular too.

Coming close on the heels of a recent Alexa survey which plainly states that Hacker News has lost more market share, this news serves to reinforce what we&#x27;ve known all along. Hacker News is collapsing in complete disarray, as fittingly exemplified by failing dead last in the recent web community IQ test.<p>You don&#x27;t need to be Paul Graham to predict Hacker News&#x27;s future. The hand writing is on the wall: Hacker News faces a bleak future. In fact there won&#x27;t be any future at all for Hacker News because Hacker News is dying.

The work is much physically easier than before: operating a crane vs. manually moving cargo. Dockworker&#x27;s unions have negotiated strong agreements related to overtime pay which guarantee time and a half. There are a far smaller number of employees needed, and those employees want to pack in as many hours as they legally can, to reap the overtime benefits. Automation of an industry can actually lead to longer hours for the fewer employees still working in the industry.<p>Since there are far fewer well paying positions like being a longshoreman, people who may have once gotten a job on the docks have to compete with everyone else for service jobs. The service jobs don&#x27;t pay enough, so many need 2 or even 3 jobs to keep their families afloat. The need for multiple jobs explains why this class of people is working longer.",1375660389

When it first started out there was a lot more technology discussion, but quickly the whole VC/fundraising aspect became very prominent. Recently, legal issues have become very prominent.<p>I think this reflects a real-world trend in what&#x27;s relevant to &quot;hackers&quot; right now. The financial aspect of the whole technology industry really seemed to take off after the Wall Street meltdown, after other financial avenues darkened (remember all those articles a couple of years ago about &quot;why we&#x27;re in a bubble/are we in a bubble?&quot;). Right now, a number of legal issues are impacting technology (software patents, NSA spying, etc) and hackers are unsurprisingly interested in discussing them.<p>I don&#x27;t think these are necessarily bad trends. I think you&#x27;re seeing a bit of the maturing of tech industry and you&#x27;re seeing that reflected in the discussion. But there is still a lot of great technical discussion on the site (the front page right now has a great story on a scanner bug, a compilers blog post, a theorem-prover as programming language article, etc).<p>And at the end, what happened to Slashdot is that reddit happened and all the smart people left, and what happened to reddit is that Hacker News happened and all the smart people left.

Essentially, when you do a startup, you choose what you are spending your time doing. You trade in your job security for freedom.<p>I have known people &#x27;drop out&#x27; of society, go on the dole, and work 14 hour days developing computer games that later sold for good money. Less admirably, I&#x27;ve known them to go on the dole, and spend all day playing computer games. They trade their place in society for freedom. This shows that in truth, modern society does give us the freedom. (in my country).<p>So why do people work? Or more pressingly, why do people work in jobs that do not meet their psychological needs for respect, autonomy, and purpose, and pay badly? Because they do, regardless of what you read in the papers, keep working at those jobs. My local supermarket is full of people who derive little identity from their work - I was one of them as a child and I know how the adult staff there think.<p>The answer, I think, is fear of what other people would think of them for scrounging. People like the post I am replying to. I think most people think like him.<p>He should, rationally, hate startup founders consuming someone elses money to mess about on a project that probably won&#x27;t make a dime. And that contradiction is the problem. Societies attitude to work is not rational, and it forces people to keep doing jobs they don&#x27;t want to that could be automated, instead of being free. Eventually, economics will destroy those jobs. A new role will be created that didn&#x27;t exist before, adding even less value than the last (but the labour is there so why not use it). Those workers desperately take the work to avoid seeing themselves as scroungers, as the enemy. And their children will grow up desperate not to be free.",1375658548

6157447,comment,6155987,6157262,1,0,lusr,,,"I&#x27;m mostly a back-end developer and I don&#x27;t have much experience with rich front-end interfaces other than my own little side projects and a WPF project from about a year back - however, I do believe the same principles apply to both front- and back-end design.<p>Specifically, you should be following the SRP - duplicated code is a symptom that you are not.  Without seeing your code that you feel doesn&#x27;t pay off, it&#x27;s difficult to answer your question more directly.<p>I will say there&#x27;s no reason you can&#x27;t design your server-side services to be consumed directly by the view, in which case I wouldn&#x27;t see a problem referencing the service directly from the view (e.g. the UserService exposed by the server implements (a) normal login, (b) login as part of checkout and (c) registration).<p>Alternatively, you could build a client-side service to wrap the server-side service and reference that directly from your views (e.g. a UserController that wraps the UserService and is consumed by (a) the omnipresent login view, (b) a login/signup view, and (c) the registration view).<p>Over and above this, there is some middle-ground where you reuse <i>structures</i>.  For example, a User structure (with IsAuthenticated, UserName, FullName etc.) would be assigned to a $scope.CurrentUser property for the views.  Consequently you don&#x27;t reimplement the User object the service implements, and you don&#x27;t vaguely depend on the entire UserService, but the data contract the view <i>does</i> depend on from the controller is still explicit by looking at the $scope definition in the controller.  Similarly, the operation contract is defined by the controller functions.  This improves maintainability and readability IMO.",1375657408

Note that the guys who made the simulation didn&#x27;t even pick the correct organism.  The cell that we have synthetic control over is M. mycoides, not M. genitalium.  Lest this seem like a nit-pickey detail, until they rewrite their software for mycoides, in broad strokes the model is essentially untestable, since we don&#x27;t have broad-scale control over the genitalium genome like we do mycoides.<p>Also note that:  &quot;The model accounts for previously observed\ngene essentiality with 79% accuracy.&quot;  This is REALLY bad.  Considering they are &#x27;seeding&#x27; the model using a biased structure that automatically &quot;knows&quot; that certain genes are essential (for example, they have a &#x27;module&#x27; for replication that probably zeroes out if you are missing an important replication component, as opposed to simulating how those genes work at a low level) this is probably somewhere close to as good as flipping a coin.",1375657337

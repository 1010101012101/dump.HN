And then remember the old proverb &#x27;misery loves company&#x27; - people assuage their anxiety about things by kvetching. Everyone does this some of the time (it&#x27;d be a bit unnatural if one didn&#x27;t) but some people interact on line like this almost all the time - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s depression or some sort of dopamine rush from getting angry about things or what, but I&#x27;ve terminated my accounts in several online communities over in recent years because I just got so sick of the sarcasm, endless negativity, and obsession with insider coding (straining to always make hip references or recycle cool quotes). It&#x27;s interesting from a sociological perspective - you can see very similar group dynamics in interest groups that would be horrified to be told they had anything in common with each other - but I think it&#x27;s very corrosive to participate in.<p>Philosopher Rene Girard has built a whole theory about this; he thinks there&#x27;s a fundamental tendency towards scapegoating in human society and that people are never happy unless they have someone to project their negative feelings onto. With the advent of AI, perhaps we&#x27;re unwittingly trying to automate that too. If this is so then some sort of scary AI is inevitable because we&#x27;ll invent in order to have a reliably hostile enemy that&#x27;s guaranteed not to vex us with diplomatic initiatives or socioeconomic guilt trips.

I think most people watch TV on a TV, where &quot;legit&quot; apps aren&#x27;t based on Flash.<p>Not too important, but quite a few legit TV apps are Flash based. YouView and TiVo in the UK are both entirely flash (AS3 for YV, TiVo was AS2 last time I worked on it). Roku I think were AS2. Samsung TVs used to support flash but that might not be handled any more, I think their browser is pretty decent now.<p>Most TVs have moved to HTML+JS though, that&#x27;s true. Thankfully many actually moved to sensible browsers too, there used to be massive inconsistencies between devices.<p>Actually a bit of a shame. Although flash can be really annoying, you can control when frames are drawn and position things accurately. You also had much better control over the memory (which things are cached, what&#x27;s still a vector), which is important if you&#x27;ve got only a few megs of RAM and you&#x27;re sliding around 1280x720 images.<p>Flash could have been hugely better, but the compiler was terrible (thanks to motion-twin though, you saved my sanity so many times on AS2 projects) and the runtime needed a lot of work on slower devices. But for animating things when you know the exact resolution you&#x27;re <i>always</i> going to be running at? Brilliant.<p>Source: worked on apps for smart TV and set top boxes.",1430292643

Using J to scroll down has always been buggy with image posts and often resets to the first post, but newest &#x27;feature&#x27; includes not being able to view threads inline. When clicking a tweet it will go to the details page (opening in a new tab doesn&#x27;t work) and when going back you have to scroll down possibly hundreds of tweets. When opening images inline (that still works in most cases) the page scrolls up a random amount, anywhere between 5 and 50 tweets it seems. Copying image URLs using right click also doesn&#x27;t work anymore when viewing an image (only from the tweet list can you copy it, then manually editing the URL to include &#x27;:large&#x27; works).

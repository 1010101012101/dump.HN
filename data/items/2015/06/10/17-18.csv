9694087,comment,9693370,9693624,0,0,parkerconrad,,,"ADP has for years, and still does, allow bookkeepers, accountants, and HR services firms similar to Zenefits to access client accounts via 3rd-party administrative logins that clients themselves set up in their payroll.<p>The way this works is that you, as an ADP client, call them up and says &quot;hey, I&#x27;ve asked my HR firm, XYZ-HR, to manage my payroll. Can you create an account for them to access my payroll system?&quot; ADP creates this account, and XYZ-HR then handles all the payroll admin work going forward -- adding employee, terming them, inputting hours worked, managing deductions, etc.<p>This is how this has worked for years, and it&#x27;s how thousands of companies do this via ADP. Even today, as an ADP RUN client, you can call in and add <i>any</i> third-party person you want as an admin to your payroll system -- as long as it&#x27;s not Zenefits. ADP has marketing materials that describe this feature, both for companies and HR / bookkeeping / accounting firms. This is how Zenefits was accessing client&#x27;s payroll, and doing so in order to take on all the administrative work related to payroll that you don&#x27;t want to handle. We weren&#x27;t &quot;hacking&quot; anything. We were doing this at our customers&#x27; request, with their full knowledge of what we were doing, and ADP set up these accounts with @zenefits.com email addresses, knowing it was Zenefits.<p>There is nothing improper about how we were doing this.",1433959174

I know, there are 1000 apps out there that track workouts so this was more of just a fun thing to build :)<p>Now that I&#x27;ve got it on my phone and playing around with it I&#x27;ve had some requests from friends that they&#x27;d love to use it too, which leads me to my question.<p>When building for myself I didn&#x27;t really care about where the data was stored. If I deleted the app off my phone I wasn&#x27;t too worried if I couldn&#x27;t get it back. Now there will be more users and more data, does it make sense from your experience to create an API to store the data remotely? I see some pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s to a remote API:<p>Pros\n- Data Backups\n- Sync across devices\n- Easier analytics (via db lookups, though Google Analytics could be arguably easier...)\n- Easier(ish) feature enhancement with a versioned API (just add some new api endpoints vs modifying the local DB)\n- No local database, just a simple JSON API, ahh...<p>Cons\n- Building an API :) That being said, it&#x27;s fairly simple setup with only a few models\n- Users would have to register (so we could authenticate them via the API and get their data)\n- Requires internet access\n- Obviously slower than having data stored locally, though how much slower isn&#x27;t clear<p>So, what would you do? Would you rather the data be stored remotely or locally? Any experience that lead you to that conclusion that you wouldn&#x27;t mind sharing?",1433958118

That makes sense when the imperative model is the natural way to understand the code, but it can be overkill when there is always a simple high-level way to understand the operation.<p>Higher-order functions give you that. If I&#x27;m filtering a sequence &quot;filter()&quot; makes that fast and easy to read. But once I start chaining more than a few together, or start passing large lambdas to them, they lose that higher level reasoning and aren&#x27;t worth it.<p>One way to look at it is, &quot;How will the reader <i>most easily</i> think about this code?&quot; If it&#x27;s as a series of high-level transformations, use HOFs. If it&#x27;s as imperative code, use a loop.<p>Another way is, &quot;Does this code need to do control flow?&quot; If so, use a statement. That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re good at.

The same goes for the fallthrough switch statement.<p>Generic bounds indeed completely go against the language&#x27;s design goals, but failing to take advantage of multicatch or generic inference (or lambda inference) is not a problem[1]. Java is a language designed for ease of reading (it says so right in its design documents), and for large teams/project, so code is made to look uniform, with all &quot;advanced&quot; features being local and obvious to anyone reading them. The goal was to make every new developer on your team (people working on large projects move around a lot) immediately able to read the code  and not have to learn the team&#x27;s DSL or coding style. Those were the problems that plagued C++ (alas, they only became apparent years after C++ had been in widespread use, and cost the industry billions), and Java very successfully avoided. Go has adopted the same design philosophy.<p>[1]: Not that it&#x27;s important, but every Java IDE would automatically suggest the shortened syntax.

It&#x27;s also clear that a few large companies are trying to figure out how to appeal to this group, while most large companies continue to be consumed by egos and the day to day grind and fail at this.<p>The most important benefit to having my own company has (by far) been the time management.

This seems to be a common misconception.<p>To put some numbers on it, a good cryptographic hash should produce random-looking output with no way to predictably influence the output, and no visible correlation between the input and the output. Put in A, get out &quot;random number&quot; B, except that every time you put in the same A, you get out the same B.<p>If you have a hash that matches that description, then your only hope is brute force, so you look at the size of the hash. If you&#x27;re breaking SHA-256, for example, that&#x27;s 256 &quot;random&quot; bits.<p>If you have a specific hash that you want to generate, it will take you on average 2^255 attempts. (On average you have to try half the possibilities before you find a match.) If your computer can do a billion hashes per nanosecond then that means you&#x27;ll spend on average 2^255 / (10^9 * 10^9) seconds, or about 10^41 times the current age of the universe.<p>If you just want to find <i>any</i> collision, then the birthday paradox comes into play, and on average you&#x27;ll need to try roughly the square root of the number of possibilities before you find a collision. At a billion per nanosecond that&#x27;s 2^128 / (10^9 * 10^9) second, or a mere 780 times the current age of the universe. Plus you have to figure out how to store all those intermediate results.<p>If MD5 fit this property it would still be good. Not as good as SHA-256, because it&#x27;s only 128 bits, but plenty sufficient. 128 bits with the hypothetical billion hashes per nanosecond gives you 390 times the current age of the universe to find a specific hash. A collision is easier, at 18 seconds, but a billion hashes per nanosecond is also orders of magnitude faster than you&#x27;ll realistically be able to do, and you&#x27;ll need 2^64 * 128 bits = 300 exabytes of storage.<p>The problem with MD5 is that it does <i>not</i> fit this &quot;random number&quot; property. You can manipulate the input with somewhat predictable results in the output if you&#x27;re clever, and that means you can generate a collision much easier than it would require for brute force.<p>My understanding is that more modern hashes are believed/hoped to have this property, but it&#x27;s unknown. And not only that, but it&#x27;s unknown whether any hash could exist with that property, or whether it&#x27;s a theoretically impossible goal.",1433956322

I shouldn&#x27;t work so hard... :-P<p>Estimation (i.e. pulling numbers out of your posterier) is not necessary (or usually desirable).  What you want to do break down the problems into roughly equal size pieces -- the more the better.  Each piece will take a certain amount of time.  You can measure this and record the average.  This becomes the estimated amount of time for each piece.  Obviously the estimate has an error with some kind of distribution (my sleep adled brain is unable to remember what a likely distribution for the amount of time something takes).<p>It doesn&#x27;t really matter because the sum of all the pieces will give you an estimate for the overall completion time for all the pieces.  <i>This</i> estimate will have a normal distribution.<p>If you write down a list of all the pieces in priority order, you can draw a line at one piece of functionality and determine when it is likely to be completed, along with error bars.<p>Of course you are unlikely to actually to do the things on your list because if you were able to correctly guess all your requirements before you started the project then you would be in fantasy land.  So what you do is tell the stake holders that this is what you are going to do unless they tell you that they want to change their mind.<p>Of course when you start they will say, &quot;We&#x27;re not going to change our mind.  We&#x27;re 100% certain that this is right&quot;.  To which you reply, &quot;Excellent&quot;.  Every 2 weeks or so, once you have done some work and can show it to the stake holders, you should also have a list of new ideas.  You should explain these new ideas and say, &quot;Do you want to change the list to add these new ideas&quot;.  Whether they say &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;, you should reply with, &quot;Excellent&quot; and carry on.<p>Often the stake holders will have an &quot;emergency&quot; and decide that they have new opportunities which change your list.  To this you should say, &quot;Excellent&quot; and change the list.<p>You should release whenever your stake holders are happy to release.<p>In this way, you have given the best estimate you can to help the stake holders plan.  Any changes to the plan will be made by the stake holders themselves at the earliest possible time.  You don&#x27;t get caught up trying to deliver at any particular date because the stake holders are aware that they are changing the deliverables.  You may have to ask them where they want to draw the line and give them new estimates for completion every time they change something, just to reinforce this idea.<p>The really tricky bit is breaking the work down into small enough pieces.  This is very, very difficult and requires a lot of experience.  The sucess or failure of the above will very likely rest on the ability to do this, so expect to pay a lot of money for someone with a proven track record doing it.  It is often worth hiring a consultant if you have nobody on staff with this experience.<p>Hope this helps.",1433955963

You use guice to create a resource and then directly test the resources api. No need to build up urls or post data to a server. No need to spin up a http server at all. Now you get statically typed tests that execute much faster. Win.",1433955663

I found they had pretty reasonable copy editors, at least the one I worked with was helpful and thorough.<p>My main problem, and the reason I didn&#x27;t finish the series was their advance was very low and the royalty rate was too. After looking round it seemed the rate was probably reasonable for authors in other fields, but very bad compared to what I would earn actually programming. Plus they absolutely refused to give me any indication of how many sales I could expect. I couldn&#x27;t justify spending the time to complete the series vs regular contracting. I think this low remuneration affects the quality of the authors they are able to attract, so you&#x27;re right in that part.",1433955661

However, isn&#x27;t it the case that Zenefits is simply building an interface on top of ADP&#x27;s payroll data? And, from what I&#x27;ve read, it seems like they did this without following the proper procedures (did they write some kind of web scraper?). So if that is the case, ADP has every right to block them. If the situation was reversed and a large company was scraping a startup&#x27;s data to integrate into their own platform, the outrage would be directed quite differently. So Zenefits is plugging into ADP&#x27;s data, not paying them for access, not following the proper procedures to get access, and selling an interface on top of that data for a 10% fee, and then they complain that ADP blocked them?<p>EDIT: Also, all of their press releases sound very immature.",1433955602

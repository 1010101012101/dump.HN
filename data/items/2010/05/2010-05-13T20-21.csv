There are hundreds of jobs out there that don't require programming or a specific college degree. There is no reason to let your degree pigeon-hole you into a career path.<p>If you're asking for my advice, I honestly don't feel like you're going to cut it as a programmer. Sorry kid. A true hacker is going to run circles around you and you'll most likely not be able to compete if you aren't competitive after college.<p>With that being said, LIFE IS NOT OVER. Find a job that you like. Most people respect those that are able to complete a computer science degree and will hire you into a huge array of jobs (financial analysts, consulting, i-banking, technical sales, etc.)",1273784370

I actually meant that all the good programmers I know - CS degree's or otherwise - started before college and did it because they loved it. Same guys that go home and read regular expression books for 'fun' in their spare time.<p>""We don't apply this criteria to other endeavors. I've been playing piano since I was 5 and I'm still not good at it. You're either good or your're not. Sometimes experience helps, sometimes it is a hindrance. Bad habits form early, too.""<p>True, but again I never said that simply programming for 20 years made you a great coder. I simply meant that someone with this trait, who then pursues a career as a programmer (through a CS degree, or whatever) is going to have a leg up on someone who isn't really into it.<p>""It's also curious that programmers claim that programming since they were a kid makes them a better programmer, but they also complain whenever a job advertisement requires years of experience.""<p>Not sure what you are talking about here. When I've had to hire a junior it seems like a lot of people with the wrong skills apply for the position, but experience-wise, if you have been programming for 20+ years that's not the issue for me.

Many of the shapes are in relative positions so the same thing above/on/below the line have different meanings, and the extra informational signals such as dots and dashes can be left off by more advanced people without changing the meaning.<p>Worse than that is that it's short because it's phonetic - so not only does the computer trying to recognise it have to do everything it does for handwriting recognition, but it also has another layer to do first - what sounds are you using and what words are you trying to write from them? 
Instead of (pen strokes -> words), you get (pen strokes -> phonetic sounds -> words). Also, Pitman shorthand is pressure sensitive - light strokes for unvoiced sounds and heavy strokes for voiced sounds, IIRC.<p>Worse even than that, it's short because it allows you to leave information out where you know what it will be and to develop your own shortcuts where useful to you. You might abbreviate your name to ""Sh"" with {name indicating symbol}, or use ""em eff ing"" for manufacturing, or have a symbol for ""Our newest product"" or write ""would like know b prices"" for ""we would like to know your best prices"".<p>So now you have pen strokes -> sounds -> filling in missing sounds -> words -> filling in missing words -> text.<p>Seems useful for taking notes in a hurry and then writing them up in full yourself the same day or week, less useful for writing for other people or future reference, and even less useful for computer recognition.",1273783583

If you're lucky, you've got a good faculty member teaching a compilers or operating systems course that'll make it challenging, but only sometimes. Teaching things like Haskell, The Lambda Calculus, Prolog, Complexity Theory and C are ""impractical"" for someone doing a CS degree, because, you know, everyone uses ""OO"" (whatever that means) nowadays so that's the theory we should teach. Plus, if we teach a hard course about the theory of computation, lots of kids will flunk, and we can't have that, now can we?<p>On the other hand, any attempt to make the curriculum practical (since most schools border on vocational training anyway) is met with the response of ""Well, a CS degree shouldn't prepare you to be an industry programmer!""<p>So really, most universities are left in a luke-warm middle-ground, where theory is being neglected but no one is willing to be the administrator who ""flips the switch"" and turns CS students into non-stop code monkeys.<p>Really, grounding yourself in a lot of CS theory, while occasionally forcing yourself to break out and hack up a project, is probably the best route to becoming a well-rounded programmer.

1345595,comment,1343753,1344969,0,0,js2,,,"<p><pre><code>  ""git pull"" -> git fetch + git merge

  ""git pull --rebase"" -> git fetch + git rebase
</code></pre>
git fetch is what syncs the remote changes to your local repo. . If you want to see these changes, they are referenced by so-called remote-tracking branches. To view them use:<p><pre><code>  git branch -r
</code></pre>
Now, if your local branch (let's say its master) has not diverged from the remote branch to which it corresponds (typically origin/master), then it doesn't matter whether you use rebase or merge. In the case where your local master is a superset of the remote master, there are no new remote changes to incorporate. In the case where where your local master is a strict subset of the remote master, then either rebase or merge will perform a so-called ""fast-forward"" operation which basically just updates your local master to the same commit as the remote master.<p>However, if your local master has diverged from the remote master, then there is work to do:<p>Rebase will take all your new local commits, set them aside, reset your local master to the same commit as the remote master, then replay your commits one at a time. If there are conflicts, you will of course have to resolve them as you go.<p>Merge, on the other hand, will attempt to create a merge commit. A merge commit is one that has two parents. In this case, the parents are the tip of the remote master and the tip of the local master. Of course, here too there may be conflicts for you to resolve.<p>Regardless of whether you performed rebase or merge, when done, your local master is now a superset of the remote master and you can push out the change. (Unless of course, while you were rebasing/merging, someone else pushed their changes. In this case, wash, rinse, repeat…).<p>Now, as to whether to use merge or rebase… there is no right answer. It very much depends on the workflow.<p>Rebase will give you a ""cleaner"" history in the sense that the history remains linear which some folks prefer. A linear history is easier to understand and if you ever need to use ""git bisect"" to find where something broke, a linear history is much easier to deal with.<p>However, some folks prefer to see the true history of development in the sense of ""when so-and-so started this work, on which commit was it originally based?"". In that case, merge preserves that information (as long as it wasn't a fast-forward -- but you can always force a merge commit with ""git merge --no-ff"").<p>In some cases, it makes sense to use both rebase and merge -- rebase for simpler changes and merge to incorporate long-lived topic-branches.<p>It pains me that the git man pages are so awful. Patches welcome (it is unfortunate that newbies provide the best perspective on how awful the docs are, while simultaneously are the least likely to be able to contribute improvements to them). Ultimately, git is actually based on some fairly simple concepts and I happen to think that once you have a conceptual understanding of it, all the commands (more or less…) start to make sense. So I strongly advocate trying to understand what the heck is going on under the hood.<p>That said, the Pro Git book is a much better place to start learning git than the git man pages.<p>Hope this helps.",1273783496

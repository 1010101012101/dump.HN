Kennedy died and we got a succession of presidents with no vision, no spirit of wonder.  NASA went from leadership to mediocrity.  Wolfe gives us the metaphor of single combat, but we thought then that the space race was way better than the arms race.  Then Johnson and Nixon dragged us through the Vietnam mud.",1248047965

713603,comment,712350,713447,0,0,skorgu,,,"Well its my first blackberry and I've only had a week or so to get used to the platform so YMMV of course.<p>tl;dr: It's great at its core competencies: voice and email are great. Everything else is a bit unfinished.<p>The bottom line is that so far it's good enough for what I use it for. I'm still crap at the keyboard but getting better, the EVDO is fast enough but not spectacular, the roller ball works well almost all of the time but the horizontal sensitivity seems a bit wonky sometimes, I haven't figured out why yet. (There's no way I'm that bad at brickbreaker so I choose to blame RIM)<p>Email integration is about 8/10, I push email from my gmail account and Exchange at work to it and that workflow is very well executed. However, reading mail on Gmail or Outlook doesn't mark the messages read on the blackberry. It's possible I'm doing something wrong here and I'm not on a BES but it hasn't annoyed me enough yet to really dig for a solution. Also Gmail IMAP sync doesn't respect your filters/tags so if you get new mail it all hits your blackberry. I ended up unsubscribing to a few mailing lists that I never really read anyway because they were just too high traffic to be buzzing me all the time.<p>There seems to be a bit of a compatibility issue with the Tour and the Storm, most apps that require unrestricted TCP access don't seem to work [1]. I can't get jmirc, midpssh etc to connect, they just die with ""Invalid URL parameter."" It'll be fixed at some point I'm sure but for now there's nothing app-wise that's useful to me. Viigo is acceptable as a podcast client but not much else. Google Voice client is alright, doesn't integrate as well as I'd like but it's workable. AIM works well, Flickr works well. The apps in the app store are great if you're obsessed about a) the weather b) financial news c) sports scores or d) playing card games, outside of that there's not much there. Then again every ""must have app"" my iPhone friends show me has me rolling my eyes so I suppose I'm just not the target market.<p>The voice quality is top notch. I was on a four hour conference call last night and I set the speakerphone up and forgot about it, no issues either hearing or being heard. That took my battery life down from full to about half. The camera is frankly barely adequate. Plenty of pixels but too much grain. [2]<p>All that said I'm buying my wife one to replace her free-and-worth-every-penny phone in a few weeks so it's safe to say I'm pleased with it. The warts just aren't in places I care about.<p>[1] <a href=""http://forums.crackberry.com/f35/tour-9630-irc-266165/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.crackberry.com/f35/tour-9630-irc-266165/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/skorgu/3737195762/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/skorgu/3737195762/</a>",1248047725

But it is something that I have thought about independently and come to the same conclusion. My life up to the age of 5 seems subjectively longer to me in memory than my life from age 17 to now (I'm 30). I have always felt that at ages 0-5, I had a much shorter total life experience to compare the passage of time to, so it feels longer.<p>I suspect that certain experiences occurring at certain periods also have a bearing. I find that some experiences tend to signal the beginning or end of different stages of my life and in some way I'm not fully able to describe, this seems to have some effect on my perception of time as I look back.<p>But for me, there's definitely something in this comparing any time period to how long you have lived so far.",1248046795

If company A develops a treatment for a disease then it will be able to make more over the long-term than company B which develops a cure for a disease. But if company A develops a treatment and two years after it gets through testing company B comes up with a cure for that same disease then company A is going to lose a boatload of money. The only way this would work is if these companies were acting as a colluding cartel, and so far all evidence seems to indicate that the companies hate each other even more than we hate them.</i><p>It doesn't require a ""conspiracy theory""; it's simple obvious fact: drug companies don't fund studies to develop and test drugs that won't be profitable.  Tell me, why do you think they would pay hundreds of millions of dollars to develop and test a drug that won't make money?  Your argument doesn't even make any sense; it <i>requires</i> that drug companies do something that is financially illogical.",1248044868

It's more like the emotions are just pushed to the side and dealt with later.  There's a large number of soldiers who bottle them up and snap.  Most, however, end up pushing them to the side because the ""now"" is more important.  Once the ""now"" is over, and others' lives aren't in your hands, you can take the time to deal with the emotions.  It's been 5 years since I got out, but it's still the same.  I can push them to the side, deal with the now, and deal with the emotions when it's not going to impact every day life.  The longer you wait, the worse it is and longer it takes, and there's probably a point where you really will snap, but it's a decidedly longer threshold.",1248044746

However if you have 2 of the 3 your still capable of succeeding.<p>If you have money and time, you can pour in those 2 aspects to get the best managers, engineers and designers<p>If you have money and skill for whatever industry your in you are able to be the visionary, the lead, be in control and are able to fill in your short commings with the funds you have. If you need the best materials, resources you can get them. You dont need to think twice about making do ... (to a certain extent)<p>If you have skill and time then you yourself can build and design whatever it is your out to achieve, you can manage and you can empower the people you think can help you to make your business succeed even though you are not yet paying them. However you need to think more carefully, negotiate more because money is not in abundance so in a way its a good thing cause it forces you to be more resourceful.<p>So far we have spent, money on servers (1 year upfront), test equipment, business registration and various other paper work costs to get a business started. This has probably all totalled to about $7000, not so much i guess.<p>But my partner and i have negotiated a pay cutt (cause we still need our day jobs but we also need the time aspect so we dont do a full 5 day work week) with our managers so that when im at my 9-5 my partner is working on our business and when his at his 9-5 im working on our business and that we also get a day where we can catchup on the work we have done.<p>There is also the 3-4 hours everday after the 9 to 5 that we spend working into the night (which means we cut down on alittle bit of sleep)<p>There are times when we cant go out when we want to cause we are close to a milestone and its just not a good time to leave even if we want to. These are not finacial costs but arguablly some are more important. I guess we have spent alot and in terms of time its been quite abit.<p>But i guess thats the sacrifice of starting a business. If its not money and time, its going to be skill and money and if its not skill and money its going to be skill and time.<p>Its got to be one of those combinations.<p>I guess",1248044523

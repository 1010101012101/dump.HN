Sure we could be lazy and just use phpmyadmin for playing with simple apps that we can't be bothered to build a backend for.

308078,comment,307722,308057,0,0,thwarted,,,"I don't know about the lisp code (where you use \w), but \\w matches a backslash and a w, as the first \ escapes the second.  I wasn't saying you were using PHP, but I know the PHP docs were confusing on how to escape things because backslash is overloaded for string escaping and for regular expression escaping and character classes.<p>I can't see how a more complete (complex?) correct regular expression would produce MORE noise in your output.  The very fact that you allow the empty string on the LHS means that you risk getting invalid addresses.<p>Continue to use that busted regular expression for parsing email addresses out of these 30,000 HTML files and please remove all my email addresses from the list you generate while you're at it.",1221736510

A business which does not defraud you or physically force you to do anything can only have economic power. If you propose to point a gun at economic power (possibly because you think that the business in question is a monopoly), then the issue is much deeper. You would have to think about what justifies ""compulsion"", about the source of monopolies, and, fundamentally, about the rights of the businessmen who own and operate the businesses you have mind (as well as your own rights, which are the same). This is a serious thinking process, but one has to go through it to understand why Wu is wrong.",1311004796

2776773,comment,2776318,2776318,3,0,photon_off,,,"I hate the domain registration system as a whole, but I love the idea of TLDs.  It's likely my anger is misplaced since I scarcely understand the business of it, but I find it infuriating that most "".com"" domain names are taken by squatters.  Perhaps squatting is just too hard to enforce (I think somebody could come up with an anti-squatting policy), but more likely I feel a lot of people decided it better to make an easy buck and have the ""market"" sort itself out.<p>However, I really like the new concept of TLDs.  There are a few reasons why I think this will benefit the internet as a whole.<p>First, if it catches on, then TLD's will mean a whole lot less.  "".com"" will lose it's ubiquity, and I (along with thousands of entrepreneurs) will finally be able to register suitable domain names.  No more need to make up names.  No more need to negotiate with professional squatters, domain name dealers, etc.<p>Second, it's not just about the <i>name</i> of the TLD, but a lot about the policy.  Imagine if "".startup"" was just $1/yr, but you have 1 month to put up a <i>real</i> site or your domain gets put back onto market.   Or you could have strict rules of inclusion:  Imagine a TLD called "".realperson"" that requires a video of you to be sent doing a backflip before registering the domain.  Of course, the authentication of doing a backflip would likely be replaced by something meaningful.<p>Third, as alluded to in my second point, it creates opportunity for businesses built off of the concept of TLDs.  There really is a ton of room for innovation.<p>Finally, I think there is <i>a lot</i> in a name.  .tv, .info, etc didn't fail to catch on because nobody cares about names.  They failed because all of the .tv and .info domains weren't owned by the same entity.  If you add cohesion to a TLD, I think it could become quite powerful, and I think there are actually a lot of cool things people will come up with.  For example, if .info were created under the new system, ""foo.info"" might be able to send you to a wikipedia summary of ""foo"".  Alright, that example is not entirely useful, but you get the picture.<p>* Disclaimer, I scarcely understand the domain business.  Any correction or insight is greatly appreciated.",1311004393

I have always found that classes where some level of conferring between students has seemed to bring the best out of the assigned task. Direct copying and working together is obviously outside this, here I am for instance talking about doing your work at a computer next to someone doing the same work - and discussing the task with them as you go through. The very best lecturers I've had, whose coursework I have learned the most from, have been the ones who allowed and encouraged this practice.<p>The end result is a class ethos and atmosphere where people learn from one another and take an active interest in the subject matter. Another result is that people can become more competitive among themselves, especially if the coursework is creative enough to allow some 'flair' to take place. (For instance in a programming task 20% of the marks are often given for extensions). A side effect of this competition is that students will not tolerate other students stealing from them. They certainly won't tolerate copying from previous years solutions. Quite apart from this intolerance of cheaters the sense of competition allows a sense of personal pride, whereby students <i>want</i> to hand in a good piece of original work.",1311004246

It is quite simple to do, and guarantees the absence of memory leaks, even in the presence of exceptions.  But it copies a lot of data.  C++ 0x move semantics will make it a little better, but it won't completely eliminate the problem.<p>Actually, copy is the <i>essence</i> of RAII.  Rather than saying ""hey, your piece of data is interesting, let me hook it"" and later complain when the fish broke your line (dangling pointer), RAII says instead ""hey, your piece of data is interesting, let me have a copy"" so you are sure to keep your data safe, and the other is sure to be able to safely destroy its own copy at any time.<p>On a side note, you could avoid copying Bar instances by using Boost's shared pointers or a garbage collector.  But it will only be practical if Bar is immutable.  I am also told that there are other memory management schemes, which can be very efficient, but tend to be complex and error prone.",1311004226

2776601,comment,2775857,2775857,16,0,flocial,,,"I agree that the software industry in Japan is deficient for lack of a better word in both quantity and quality.  Mainly it's the result of a short-sighted bureaucracy running industry and education.  Aside from the language barrier, which is formidable but manageable, Japan had all the ingredients needed to foster a thriving software industry (mainly a talented workforce schooled in science and a hardware manufacturing industry that could supply any and all the parts, at least in the 80s and early 90s).<p>The cultural obsession with making ""stuff"" or ""monozukuri"" is more a romantic notion nurtured by the economic slump as America made a massive comeback dominating every part of the IT field from hardware to software.  Craftsman are highly regarded in Japan but great programmers see themselves as part of this tradition and peers regard them as such.  It completely ignores the fact that the video-gaming industry and even anime is ""soft"" driven and a significant part of Japanese contemporary culture.<p>On the policy side there's just not enough support for entrepreneurship in general and more so for IT.  Many of the first movers in the Japanese IT bubble crossed over into establishment quite quickly and the Livedoor scandal just provides government with a massive excuse to stay conservative.  The fact that both Livedoor, Rakuten and SoftBank made hostile bids for media companies at one point probably did some damage as well in terms of turning traditional media against them.<p>Labor laws make it highly prohibitive to fire full-time workers and social benefits still tend to accrue to people who don't change companies.  Of course, times are changing but policy still prevails.  For any software startup in Japan hiring someone is hard because good people are conditioned to seek stability and hiring someone is risky for the startup because they are dealing with less talented people with the same employment guarantees.  Although the IT industry in Japan mirrors general global trends to a degree, so there are more career changes, people are very risk averse and probably less mobile than a comparative sample from the states.<p>Also corporations tend to foster a false sense of homogenity which usually results in long hours and minimal incentives for performance.  I've seen so many exceptional people, especially programmers, clash and ultimately burn against corporate culture.  The rest go on leave for clinical depression.<p>In terms of education, the curriculum just plain sucks for science in general and for sciences more students flock to traditional engineering fields where the get to learn FORTRAN or COBOL and maybe play with R.  Professors in Japan, even in the sciences, rarely lift a finger and many are completely inept with computers.  Of course, younger professors aren't but with Japanese demographics they'll struggle to find tenure.  Not to mention undergraduates don't study much compared to other countries since the entrance exam is the main event.<p>In terms of culture and language, Japanese allows for so much vagueness that I think it creates a serious barrier to clear and logical thinking needed for not only programming but interface design.  People avoid debates of any kind and when they do occur, they quickly get emotionally heated.  Also, a lot decisions for even the interface gets run by the committee or are consensus-based and that's not a good thing in general for design of any kind as you need a grand architect who knows what they're doing and can move with conviction.<p>I really can't do this topic justice unless I go and write a book so I don't think a short article by The Economist can address it either.  Japan has a lot to offer too but those are my impressions on what's holding them back.",1311002051

Are you just talking the talk to make a practice you engage in (and yourself as a user) look better in the court of public opinion?  Have you just swallowed the ""if its profitable, it is therefore good in every metric"" ideology hook, line and sinker? I really don't get where you're coming from.",1311001373

The WiMax question was just a ""warm up"" easy question, so that students that do not know what WiMax is can start learning about the concept, before doing the 5-forces analysis.<p>This was the reason that, initially, I did not bother penalizing the copy & paste behavior for these questions.

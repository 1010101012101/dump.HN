(Open-source Ruby on Rails applications.) If so, I would really appreciate it if you could leave a comment with the name of your startup, and the apps that you use. Thanks!<p>Full disclosure: I'm applying for an O-1 visa so that I can move to SF and work for a YC startup. I've contributed a lot of code to these apps, but need some statistics for a recommendation letter.<p>An H-1B visa would definitely be easier, but unfortunately, I don't have a degree or the required experience.<p>[1] https://github.com/errbit/errbit

5096663,comment,5095643,5096583,1,0,WhaleBiologist,,,">it's objectively a worse use of those engineers' time<p>If you are ActivisionBlizzard, or EA. What do you do if you're not them? THQ is a good example of a publisher that tried to mimic the big dogs, and failed dismally because of it. There's a huge difference between AAA games company, and wannabe-AAA games company, and the expansive graveyard of developers/publishers is a testament to that.<p>It seems incredulous to me that when facing a distant bankruptcy, the best choice is to keep doing what you've been doing, dump all your remaining cash into finishing the AAA games you've got going, and betting it all on black. Are these companies completely oblivious to the fact that smaller, indie-style games are, at the very least, profitable?<p>Maybe the games industry culture really is this self-destructive. Or maybe, with budgets so high, even for a huge company, solvent to insolvent can be 1 or 2 poor releases away.",1358855899

5096649,comment,5081838,5081838,1,0,jekky,,,"I personally like Yann LeCun and like this idea. However, the root problem in CS research community is not a bad reviewing/publishing system. From my point of view, it is the evaluation system of the so called ""professor"" and researcher. The performance of the research is evaluated by the publications (the number or the citation). So here is the consequence: only a part of good ""professor""/researcher really care about his research, all others care about the publication instead of research. My personal experience, you can see everywhere the ""professor"" push his graduate students to publish the paper. They are engaging in making the relationships to make his paper easily be published and make a lot of citations without any meaning. The publication is just a medium to describe the research analysis, results, etc, the true contribution is the research itself. Another point I want to say to learn and teach the knowledge is a very important responsibility of a professor. However, many professors only want to get publications from his students. So my conclusion, if the evaluation does not change, people still will abuse the new good review/publish system to get more publications, instead of doing valuable research.<p>Another very funny thing is that until now, CS research community always publish paper with improved results, good performance. It is definitely not true and the experience from failure should be also a good material to share.",1358855668

I tried to take a knife to my wrists but failed, then ate all the drugs I had on my shelf.  Knocked myself out, and woke up in my own vomit with very sore wrists, not a cent to my name and all my credit cards maxed out from online gambling.  The lowest point of my life.<p>There was a build up leading up to that point, I had previously fantasized and romanticized about it.<p>For me being suicidal was like being down an inescapable black hole.  Managing depression was similar.  When hard times hit, it's all too easy to let your mind slip down this black hole and start feeling suicidal and depressed, I have to fight to not go to that place mentally.  But when you're feeling low and you can feel yourself slipping into this black hole it's very tempting to allow yourself to fall right in.<p>For me also being suicidal was a deeply visceral experience, and also an experience of high perceived clarity.  Mentally I felt very clear and focused.<p>It was also a time of uncontrollable and intense emotion.  I felt deeply emotional about life and humanity in general, with small moments of shame.  It was also a time of high desperation, and a place I could see no escape from.  It was a very strong cocktail of negative emotions which are hard enough to deal with individually.  Life as it appeared around me I perceived as meaningless and vacuous.  The path of least resistance to get through each day was cynicism.  Sometimes when I watch the TV or news I had uncontrollable surges of very intense empathy which would cause me to cry.  It's very hard to articulate exactly how low and desperate I felt.<p>Fortunately for me my family were always there for me, and now I feel I am better.  Even though at times I did not recognise they were there for me, they were and they were acting on it.  Eventually I started to recognise it and very slowly I started to make things better.<p>I really don't think there was any other way for me to escape it all except with the help of my family.  I dread to think what would of become of me if I didn't have that support network.  I feel if I did not have that support network, I do not think I would have escaped alive.  For suicidal people in worse position than I was I do not know how you would go about helping them.",1358854567

5096586,comment,5095371,5095371,1,0,xijuan,,,"It is very late when I read your post. But I am deeply touched by your initiative and your effort to help your fianc to go through such a hard time. I could only wish that my bf (now ex bf)would be as supportive as you have...and have not left me after I have experienced a hard time.
I have experienced mild depression in the past. Until now, I am not definitely sure if it was severe enough to be called clinical depression but I had felt that I had hit my lowest point and felt very down and uncomfortable. I also have a friend who occasionally suffers depression. I did psychology as my undergraduate degree so all my suggestions would either come from my own experiences and things I have learned in courses. 
I suggest you to read into a bit about cognitive-behavioural therapy and Carl Rogers' person-centered therapy. I think Rogers' person-centered therapy is very easy to learn. In fact, people in suicide hotlines are trained in person-centered therapy. Two main aspects of this therapy are unconditional positive regard and empathy. Unconditional positive regard means that accepting your fianc for who she is without disapproving feelings, actions or characteristics. And empathy of course means understanding and appreciating your fiance's feelings. During a therapy session, the therapist won't give suggestions to the client's problems. Instead, the therapist would repeat what the client has said in different wordings and ask relevant questions until the client figures out what he/she really wants. When my friend is experiencing anxiety and depression, I usually use some of these techniques. Here is the link to Carl Rogers' famous therapy session (there are five parts to the therapy. The link is the first part of it):
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBkUqcqRChg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBkUqcqRChg</a><p>Of course, you should ask her to see a psychologist and a psychiatrist. But beside those, in recent literature on depression, yoga and mindfulness meditation have also shown to be very effective in treating depression and anxiety. So I highly suggest your fiance to try those, especially considering that yoga sessions are way cheaper than therapy sessions with a psychologist.<p>Also, exercising is very very important!! Exercising in and out of itself can help relieve depression. Theoretically, during exercising, stress hormones are expended and endorphins are released. If you have time, bring her out for a run or something. I think for any people who are prone to depression, exercising regularly is a must if you want to prevent depression.<p>I don't know if you know much about depression and how depression is diagnosed. If you don't know, I suggest you to read about it, especially how DSM diagnoses major depression. I want to make you highly aware that DSM criteria are constantly changing and how we conceptualize depression is also constantly changing. Just because your fiance is feeling very down for few days, it doesn't necessarily mean she is having a major depression. Also just because doctors think antidepressants would help her, it doesn't mean she really needs to take it. 
Also depression comes in episodes. And most people's depressive episode will be over in 6 months even without any treatment. It is called spontaneous remission. Anyone who has the motivation to get better and who receives LOTS OF SOCIAL SUPPORT will definitely get better sooner than that. Oh I guess that is a very important thing to mention: SOCIAL SUPPORT! I am very glad that you are offering her social support because social support really really makes a difference. Please talk to her friends and family and ask them to give her a lot of encouragement and support!<p>Last thing I want to say is that stress is what triggers depression in most cases of a depressive episode. Therefore, reducing stress is also very important. If you can help her with some tedious chores so that she doesn't have to be stressed out about it, it would also help her dealing with her depression.",1358854329

Thing is, once you've done the structures correctly (i.e. copied git) the versioning just falls right out. The whole project really started off as a logical extrapolation of git's data structures.<p>I don't have a dev log at all, sorry. It would be good to get my insights down on paper.",1358853241

5096547,comment,5091684,5094243,6,0,WickyNilliams,,,"I think you're slightly off with your conclusion of responsive web design. It doesn't aim to cater to people resizing their windows (that's just an added benefit), it aims to cater to all devices <i>regardless</i> of window size.<p>Assuming we're still considering responsive design, if designed from a mobile-first perspective you'd be surprised how clean the code can be to deal with this. Start with minimal resources and most of your content stacked vertically so that it's lightweight and easy to consume on a touch device. Providing you've used relative units (ems in particular) you can scale up for larger screen with super simple media queries that just bump the font-size on body (e.g. body { font-size: 120%; }). You can find an awesome overview of this approach on Trent Walton's site [1]. Compare this with a hacky approach of doing desktop-first - you're loading assets (probably) unnecessarily, hiding chunks of markup to never be displayed, hammering your CSS to fit your desktop peg into a mobile hole. I know this doesn't cover everything, and any sufficiently complex site will require more than just bumping font-size, but honestly it doesn't have to be super difficult and full of horrible workarounds.<p>Now with the resposnive vs. separate site debate, the way I've always thought of it is responsive site for web <i>sites</i>, separate sites for web <i>apps</i>. Apps are sufficiently complex, with enough interaction that they require fundamental changes in HTML, CSS and JS to adapt to touch devices. Which leads onto the next point, serve a separate version of a web app based on touch/non-touch not window size, as it is the interaction method that should dictate design choices not how small the window is. It might then be wise to adopt a hybrid approach for your touch-specific app, where you scale up/down for larger/smaller touch-based devices.<p>Note that some of this may change and become significantly simpler with the advent of the Shadow DOM [2] and Flexbox layouts [3]<p>[1] <a href=""http://trentwalton.com/2013/01/07/flexible-foundations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trentwalton.com/2013/01/07/flexible-foundations/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowd...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://weblog.bocoup.com/dive-into-flexbox/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblog.bocoup.com/dive-into-flexbox/</a>",1358852985

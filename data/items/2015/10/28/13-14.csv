The way the call execution works is that as long as there is at least one honest caller, then calls cannot be censored.  Call execution is a binary operation as the executor can&#x27;t control the call data.  So the only thing a call executor has control over is whether or not they execute the call.  Even in the situation where some attacker represents a large part of the caller pool, there is a section during the last part of the call window where anyone may execute the function call in exchange for a large payout.  So even if an attacker is operating 99/100 of the accounts executing function calls, that 1 honest person can execute the call if everyone else chooses not to.",1446040703

In reality, the RIAA system spends a lot of money on behalf of artists/groups, in a similar notion that car dealerships are at the forefront for manufacturers and brand stability. Sometimes dealerships go bust, sometimes labels go bust...sometimes dealerships do so well they become multi-million dollar enterprises (Don Huffines in Texas...now State Senator Don Huffines), and same goes for record labels (Big Machine).<p>Both the dealership association and the RIAA push very hard in lobbying for their own ends.

It seemed like many for-profit colleges are simply a way for &quot;schools&quot; to collect federally guaranteed loans that the students then have to pay back. The student assumes all of the risk.<p>The other side of this industry are charter schools. These are for-profit K-12 schools, often paid for by state / local governments. The problems with them are:<p>1) Graft is common, with charter school administrators sometimes taking home ludicrous salaries ($500k+ for schools with ~1,000 students)<p>2) Funding often comes directly from the local school district, most of which are already severely cash-strapped. The problem here is that the cost of a single student attending a school district is largely buried in fixed costs: when the state takes $6000/yr from a district and gives it to a charter school, the district&#x27;s costs do not decrease by $6000. This makes school districts worse, which accelerates flight to charter / private schools.<p>3) Educational standards are different -- in most states, faith-based charter schools are totally ok. As long as they teach some bare-minimum requirements, they can teach as much religion as they want. Also, most states offer some sort of funding incentive based on test scores -- which just encourages schools to play the numbers game by finding reasons to suspend/expel struggling students, encourage cheating on tests, etc.<p>To be fair, not all charter schools are for-profit, and there are good charter schools and bad ones. But the entire system stinks; it cuts funding to struggling districts, leaving them in a perpetual budget crisis. It often does little to improve the education of students, while placing more of the burden on parents to go shopping for a school.",1446039588

For heaven&#x27;s sake you need a state license just to give manicures. In America.<p>This includes everything from manicurists to medical doctors. Repealing these would do two things. First, it would eliminate an unnecessary barrier of entry into a wide variety of occupations, unleashing a great many new job opportunities. Second, it would give consumers -- particularly the poor -- access to low-cost alternatives that today are illegal. Government approval is no guarantee of quality anyway. We don&#x27;t need it.<p>I would also suggest eliminating the Federal Reserve System and its monetary policy of gradual inflation. America&#x27;s period of greatest economic growth was between the end of the Civil War and the start of World War I. Under a regime of moderate <i>deflation</i> the economy grew 4% year-over-year for a sustained period. Living standards rose across the board. Economic mobility was high. I believe this to be directly attributable to the incentives that exist under a monetary policy of slow deflation: saving is rewarded, prices fall over time, yet innovation and wise investment are greatly rewarded. (Gradual inflation, on the other hand, impels people to borrow and borrow <i>a lot</i>, which just on its own reduces one&#x27;s economic mobility. Excessive borrowing can also be understood as consuming too much in the present at the cost of the future, which is where the boom-bust cycle comes from. Gradual inflation also makes saving extremely difficult. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t want their savings to erode over time is forced to become a speculator.

This doesn&#x27;t mean pay a firm $20,000 for a week or two of work, it means find the highest quality you can afford.<p>My own firm works with YC companies all the time and they are generally very happy with the work I do. I think it really comes down to what you offer. If you charge an unreasonable amount, have pushy salespeople, inflate the findings in your report or just view your job as handing off a report and demanding a bill, you&#x27;re doing it wrong and not contributing value.<p>On the other hand, fairly priced security consulting with an eye towards developer education and working with the company to resolve their vulnerabilities contributes a lot of value. More security firms should try to help companies improve their security in the SDLC.<p>I do hope crowdsourcing security improves. I think it could be better, but it isn&#x27;t yet. The results in my experience are mixed - for every bounty hunter who finds vulnerabilities you have another nine who just spam for pity findings on Hackerone and Bugcrowd.

If I want to own it, why can&#x27;t I just convert to a purchase? These options are not fluid and interchangeable which necessitates much more of a &quot;sale&quot; rather than a more flexible, value oriented approach. A manufacturer should always be willing to convert a purchased vehicle into a lease or rental again.<p>Inventory/Planning:<p>- trim levels are out of control and make inventory planning much worse. If the base model sells for $18K but is available in a $36K trim level, is it really the same car?  Why not just keep it simple.  Nobody wants the salesperson to exert pressure to make me buy some &quot;touring package&quot; that I don&#x27;t care about just because that is what is on the lot.<p>Pricing/Selling:<p>Buying a car takes hours while you wait for the salesperson to try to sucker you into paying full MSRP and he/she pretends to be negotiating on your behalf with the manager, who writes with a marker on the sheet of paper the best price. This horrible practice is highly unpleasant for all involved.  The dealer lobby prefers negotiated pricing over fixed price because it suckers poorly informed consumers (many of whom are elderly) into overpaying.<p>I&#x27;d like to walk into a dealership pre-approved for a loan and pick from among 3 or 4 exterior colors and be done with it in 10-20 minutes.  Better yet I&#x27;d like to just order it online and have it delivered in a few weeks, or better yet (per the above suggestion) just rent it for a month on an impulse.<p>All this is probably a distraction though, since self-driving car tech will allow us to get by with a fraction of the number of cars on the road and likely few of us will choose to own a car in the traditional sense.",1446038293

That, instead, you were unfairly advantaged by artificial pressures in that market much bigger and more entrenched than you.<p>Essentially, the incumbents have been lied to for years and, now that new logistical realities are changing the status quo, it is very hard for them to understand <i>why</i> this is happening.

Developers in SV don&#x27;t understand this, probably because they aren&#x27;t directly doing the cost calculations.<p>And here is the problem - articles like his one, saying how outsourcing doesn&#x27;t work, are actually why outsourcing doesn&#x27;t work. For example, consider someone who reads one article daily which says outsourcing doesn&#x27;t work or that the resources are not very good. In last 10 years I have yet to meet a single client that gave the kind of independence you get as a developer in US. Yet every time all I read in a client&#x27;s bad experience is that he/she had given too much independence.<p>I am in Bangalore and I work for a British Client. I WILL take the name, it is 3ds (French one). And here the only thing that matters is that client remains happy. Here is what happens here in Bangalore:<p>1. Client doesn&#x27;t give any work which requires cognitive skills, since he is sure the return will be bad and he doesn&#x27;t have time to take chances.<p>2. This in turn discourages good developers and forces them to:<p>a) Suck it up, forget about any career achievements and keep doing the maintenance job as mortgage payments are a bigger threat. Slowly the quality of output decreases.<p>b) Switch clients/jobs, which means sudden requirement of a resource and investing even more time in training him/her.<p>3. A lot of companies hear only bad stories about China stealing tech and making knock-offs, never mind that most of these knock-offs don&#x27;t have any effect outside China and China is a closed market in the first place, that they have trouble handing over critical software/hardware for development. Half of my friends I know work via VPN even in office. In my office it is not possible to work on a laptop. I need to come to office and then work <i>remotely</i>. This is shit. Even with internet speeds in India being faster and cheaper than UK/US, when 2k people suddenly connect to VPN from a single point cursor stops responding immediately. This means slower work.<p>4. All meeting times are decided by client according to his/her convenience. Almost all of clients from UK that I have worked so far had literally 0 idea what its like to attend a scrum after lunch. Too early to start asking questions, too late to completely absorb the answers. US is even worse - most American clients set up a meeting at around 10:00pm (9:30am PST). Then they complain that people from India don&#x27;t talk a lot.<p>5. Worst is pacifying a client&#x27;s ego. It is not possible to tell him that he has done something wrong. It is not possible to squarely go over his authority and fix it. So Indian managers let the failures lurk for longer than necessary, and at the last moment find some scapegoat and hope the client doesn&#x27;t fire him.<p>Mediocre developers are who make it big at the end. They stick around until H1B and then earn hefty amounts abroad.",1446037750

New cars are very nearly sold direct, the dealer doesn&#x27;t arbitrarily mark up prices, in fact I think some manufacturers prevent it.  There is a fixed profit for the dealer, for the most part.   The manufacturers go to fairly good lengths to get the cars people want to the dealers too and then they try to have an assortment of dealer customizations that can be done, like the dealer can change the stereo out and do things like that. It&#x27;s just pure brand for the dealers, why they sell new cars is just to avoid being labeled a &quot;used car dealer.&quot;<p>Service and used cars are the broken market, those subsidize new car sales.  &quot;Certified used cars&quot; and such are almost always over paid for.  If can be dramatic too,  we tracked my wives old Subaru through from trade-in.  They gave us about $2000, then the last we saw it it was still in the region (about 80 miles away in a smaller town) listed for just under $8000.   It was very clean and needed a new head gasket, they may have done that, maybe not, that would have cost us about $2000 so it didn&#x27;t cost them that.  even if it did they were still asking 100% more and we don&#x27;t know what price the eventual buyer negotiated.<p>The laws that protect the dealers may be a problem, it looks like most states just want to protect the big &quot;local&quot; businesses from the big corporations though.

10464149,comment,10463464,10463706,0,0,pron,,,"I think it&#x27;s part of a general trend of language designers (and even language fans) not understanding what makes languages work in practice. For academic languages this may not matter, but if you actually want your language to be used, you need to pay attention. A recent study[1] has shown that &quot;extrinsic&quot; factors (performance, tooling, familiarity, libraries) matter a lot more than intrinsic factors (syntax, abstractions) when it comes to adopting programming languages. A language that understood this beautifully was Java[2] (and, I believe, Go, which is very much in the spirit of the Java philosophy), that analyzed existing &quot;advanced&quot; languages like Scheme, Self and Modula (and indeed some of the people involved with those languages were among Java&#x27;s early designers) and realized that the features that give those languages most bang-for-the-buck weren&#x27;t clever abstractions but extra-linguistic features such as GC, dynamic linking and JITs[3], that can be packaged in a crude, &quot;blue-collar&quot; language that&#x27;s familiar (and familiarity is indeed among the top factors in choosing a language, while &quot;correctness&quot; -- as in more powerful type system -- and particular language features are among the last). James Gosling called it a wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing. A wolf in wolf&#x27;s clothing may <i>look</i> more fierce, and the sheep&#x27;s clothing may indeed limit its maneuverability a bit, but it can still be almost as wolfish, yet much more palatable.<p>OTOH, Kotlin took whatever it could from Ceylon (the nullability types, flow-sensitive typing) while keeping 100% seamless interoperability with Java as the top priority, so it may not be a revolution, but its adoption costs are virtually zero. It doesn&#x27;t even have much of a runtime library; it was designed in such a way that all cool features could be applied to Java&#x27;s standard library. The idea was that abstractions are great <i>as long as they don&#x27;t come at the expense of more important features</i>, such as availability of libraries, tools etc (Kotlin even supports Java&#x27;s annotation processors, so popular libraries that rely on compile-time verification/code-generation such as Dagger can work on Kotlin code).<p>Of course, I take this much further than you and believe, unlike you, that the contribution of advanced language-level abstractions is not so pronounced at all (or, at least, it hasn&#x27;t been shown to be significant), and obviously I have a very different perspective on Scala than you, but at least we can agree on something :)<p>[1]: Paper: <a href=""http://lmeyerov.github.io/projects/socioplt/papers/oopsla2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lmeyerov.github.io/projects/socioplt/papers/oopsla201...</a> Accompanying talk: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2ITaI4y7_0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2ITaI4y7_0</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://youtu.be/Dq2WQuWVrgQ?t=14m12s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/Dq2WQuWVrgQ?t=14m12s</a> about why Java was designed the way it was<p>[3]: Sun had experimented with a JIT for Self long before it was introduced to Java, and the plan was to make Java exploit JITs almost from the get-go.",1446037418

But otherwise, the working time on a car from start to finish, including paint, is somewhere in the 10-20 hour range. Theoretically, your timeline could work but paint takes time to cure, then needs polish and interior features take a while, although CAN-BUS has certainly made the electronics easier.",1446037298

10464134,comment,10463205,10463378,0,0,gnoway,,,"I think manufacturers are going in the opposite direction now, though.<p>When I bought my VW they had just recently (within past 2-3 years) changed to a packaged model for options where you had to buy options together, and packages were dependent on others in tiers. So e.g. if I wanted the xenon headlights or the &#x27;kessy&#x27; keyless entry and start, I had to buy the option package with those, which I think also included an upgraded stereo system. This package required another option package full of other things I didn&#x27;t want (sunroof, sat nav), so in short if I wanted fancy headlights I had to buy a whole slew of other things to get them. In the past I could have ordered those headlights separately. I ended up not getting any extra options.<p>I think what&#x27;s going on is that they want to be able to forecast how much of each option they need, and they want to be able to turn around on a new car purchase quickly. If it was all custom, they either have to build it overseas and ship it - takes a long time - or they have to ship generic cars here and install the options somewhere else, like the dealership, where they have inventory and tooling and personnel costs issues. It&#x27;s much easier to produce 1000 red cars with option package a and reduce choice for the customer, as long as they go for it.",1446037257

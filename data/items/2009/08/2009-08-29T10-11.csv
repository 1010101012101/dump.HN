They have polished their material flows up to a point of perfection.<p>Cost-cutting has always been the key to Ikea, not design. Thus a change to Verdana with the provided reasoning ""It's more efficient and cost-effective"" is in my opinion 100% true to the brand.",1251542816

793031,comment,791821,792710,0,0,swombat,,,"On the contrary, it does apply if you're doing any kind of splitting of your users along various axes.<p>For example, if you're comparing users from Slashdot to users from Hacker News, you might get the following data set for, say, the average click-through rate over 1 week:<p>Week 1:<p>Slashdot: 500 hits, 50% click-through rate (250 click-throughs)<p>Hacker News: 10 hits, 90% click-through rate (9 click-throughs)<p>Based on this data, you might decide to tweak the page to be more Hacker-News friendly and less Slashdot-friendly. But, hey, maybe you want to run the experiment for one more week, just to be sure.<p>Week 2:<p>Slashdot: 10 hits, 10% click-through rate (9 click-throughs)<p>Hacker News: 500 hits, 20% click-through rate (100 click-throughs)<p>Wow, we have confirmation! Hacker News is clearly a better source of traffic than Slashdot. So you forget about Slashdot, since HN is consistently giving you a better click-through rate than Slashdot.<p>Except, of course, when you look at the combined numbers...<p>Weeks 1 and 2 combined:<p>Slashdot: 50.7% (259 click-throughs for 510 hits)<p>Hacker News: 21.3% (109 click-throughs for 510 hits)<p>So here, the paradox applies in reverse - looking at the weekly data gives you a false impression about how to tweak things to achieve your overall goals.<p>Now, you might say, this is not A/B testing, just monitoring click-through rates of various sources. However, if you simply double this test (so that you're testing two versions of a page), you might once again reach erroneous conclusions about how each version works for each referrer, because of the Simpson effect.<p>So while this is not immediately relevant to the most basic A/B testing, it can easily become relevant to more complex examples. And, of course, if you're doing your A/B testing without doing any splitting of the incoming users, you might miss out some other subtleties about your users, so there's a strong temptation to do so.",1251541076

I've developed using PHP+Codeigniter, and I find Continue to be a <i>lot</i> easier to use (if you know scheme, of course). It is easy to get started, thanks to the DrScheme IDE and the ""batteries included"" philosophy of PLT scheme, and you can deploy a working executable (including the web server and all the dependencies) with just a few clicks.",1251540572

I was wondering about evaluating the potential business or philanthropic benefits of interventions on cryonics; e.g. funding research on effectiveness of current protocols or on developing better protocols, seeding larger operations and capturing economies of scale, advertising/PR, lobbying for rights, etc. I haven&#x27;t properly thought this through at all, but I suspect that there might actually be a pretty good philanthropic argument for some kind of preservation.<p>Society could save big on healthcare (not to mention the disutility of being kept alive to the bitter end) by preserving anyone whose health is in severe decline; anyone who has brain cancer, Alzheimer&#x27;s, Parkinson&#x27;s, etc.; anyone with imminently terminal diseases; and so on, all voluntarily of course. I believe end-of-life healthcare can typically cost tens of thousands of dollars, which is commensurate with preservation costs.<p>Further, it seems like I&#x27;d much rather save one person to live a long life (at the very least, thousands of years), than save two lives to live a standard life of ~50 more years. Though admittedly this depends on what you think your terminal values are, and also on difficult-to-estimate effects, e.g. the instrumental benefits of having more people alive now to help with morale or with doing stuff. And for obvious reasons this is uncomfortable to have to consider, and even more uncomfortable to actually propose as philanthropic policy.",1432515383

9598156,comment,9596033,9598121,0,0,lukifer,,,"Here is my high-level hypothesis, sans numbers: most workers produce far less real value than what they are paid. At one end you have many white-collar jobs that are glorified seat fillers, padding budgets for their departments. At the other end, you have blue-collar jobs whose value is artificially inflated by a minimum wage (or, wastefully shipping work overseas, and finished products back.)<p>In a UBI world (also assuming socialized medicine), neither minimum wage nor de facto salary+benefits would be necessary, and labor would be free to seek its true market value, as the competition becomes over status rather than survival. My hunch is that even if all work was taxed (flat or progressive) to pay for it, the actual purchasing power of the dollar would increase to offset it due a more efficient market. (It would also be offset by the elimination of means-testing and beauracracy in existing social programs, as well as enabling a great deal more education and entrepreneurship.)<p>Admittedly, the idea is abstract and hand-wavy.

The state of being homeless is very depressing and can bring about mental illness in the previously undiagnosed.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is actually the explanation he thinks it is. A significant portion of homeless people had mental illnesses before losing their house. In many cases, illnesses like schizophrenia or untreated mood disorders contribute to homelessness by making it harder to maintain the social connections that form a safety net for many people (for instance, if the poster had driven away all his friends with manic episodes before becoming homeless, nobody would have been around to lend him a car and go get a new contracting job).",1432514770

9598142,comment,9596496,9596496,0,0,graycat,,,"To start, yes, I do like the question of P\nversus NP and regard it as a very\nimportant research question.<p>My reaction to the video lecture:  Wow.\nAmazing.  Gee whiz.  P versus NP.  What a\nbiggie!  Or is it?<p>There does seem to be a little, tiny,\nitsy, bitsy point where the lecture went\noff the track:<p>The lecture gave a big list of some of the\namazing things we could do if we could\nprove that P = NP.  Some of the items on\nthat list were protein folding (to cure\ncancer) and scheduling.<p>Right?  Not so much:<p>If someone has an important problem in\nscheduling, protein folding or any of the\nNP-complete problems, bring forward that\nactual, specific, instance of the real\nproblem.<p>Why?  Because there&#x27;s no proof and little\nevidence that finding a solution will be\ntoo difficult for &quot;current computers&quot;.<p>To this claim I can hear the complaint\nnow:<p>&quot;But, but, but, the problems in\nNP-complete are too difficult to solve for\ncurrent computers because as the problem\nsize increases, the best known algorithms\nhave running time that grows as an\nexponential in the size of the problem,\nand exponential growth limits us to\nproblem instances of just small down to\ntiny size.&quot;<p>Yup, can hear that complaint.<p>Good news, guys:  The complaint is false\nand does not correctly explain the\nchallenge of NP-complete.<p>E.g,, 0-1 integer linear programming is in\nNP-complete, but I can write down, as fast\nas I can type, such problems about as big\nas you please that I, or anyone, can solve\nquickly just by simple inspection.<p>It&#x27;s true.<p>E.g., for any positive integer n, consider\nthe 0-1 integer linear programming problem<p><pre><code>     max z = 1 * x1 + 2 * x2 + ... + n * xn\n\n     subject to\n\n     x1 + x2 + ... + xn = 1\n\n     x1, x2, ..., xn = 0 or 1\n</code></pre>\nSo, the error in the complaint is that\nactually the question of P versus NP has\nto do with <i>worst case</i> instances of the\nproblems.  But practical instances are not\nall worst case, and for many of the\npractical instances we can get solutions.<p>So, for any particular actual, specific,\ninstance of a real problem, bring it\nforward -- you might be able to get a\nsolution.<p>And, wait, there&#x27;s more!<p>For a problem like scheduling, mostly what\nis desired is just to save money in the\nactual operations, say, airlines where we\nneed to schedule the planes for the\nplanned flights, the crews, and\nmaintenance for the planes.<p>Since the planes do fly, tough to convince\nme that the scheduling is impossible.<p>So, if spending $200 million a month on\noperations, an optimal schedule could save\n$20 million, can find a schedule that is\n<i>approximately optimal</i> and saves all but\nthe last $100,000, then take the\n$19,900,000 savings and be happy.<p>The claim &quot;we want to show that P = NP so\nthat we can solve all these important\nproblems&quot; has been going on since the\ncartoon early in<p>Michael R. Garey and David S. Johnson,\n&#x27;Computers and Intractability:  A Guide to\nthe Theory of NP-Completeness&#x27;.<p>where the mathematician stood before the\nbusiness executive and admitted that he\ncould not solve the executive&#x27;s problem\nbut neither could any of the\nmathematicians in a long line.<p>Likely nonsense:  The mathematician was\nlikely just looking for a long term job\nand actually not at all interested in\nsolving the executive&#x27;s problem.<p>Why?  Because there was no indication that\nthe executive&#x27;s problem was large and\nworst case and needed an exactly optimal\nsolution instead of a nearly optimal\nsolution.  The executive&#x27;s problem might\nhave been relatively easy to solve, with a\nnearly optimal solution and maybe with an\nexactly optimal solution.<p>Indeed, the book was from Bell Labs where\none of their interests was network design.\nWell, since the phones did work, somehow\nBell did find feasible solutions.\nOptimal?  Maybe not.<p>So, what was &quot;the executive&#x27;s problem&quot;\nthat was in NP-complete and &quot;too difficult\nto solve?&quot;.  Maybe he just wanted to\ndesign a telecommunications network to\nhave the needed performance and\nreliability and, otherwise, get the cost\ndown as much as possible or nearly so.\nFinding an algorithm that shows that P =\nNP is very likely a significantly\ndifferent problem, not his problem, and\nnot necessary for his problem.<p>This erroneous belief that all <i>large</i>\ninstances of problems in NP-complete are\ntoo difficult to solve is too common:\nE.g., once I got a problem in allocation\nof marketing resources.  The instance was\n0-1 integer linear programming with 40,000\nconstraints and 600,000 variables.<p>I thought for a day or so, typed in some\nsoftware, did some <i>Lagrangian\nrelaxation</i>, and in 905 seconds on a 90\nMHz PC got a feasible solution guaranteed\nto be within 0.025% of optimality.  Close\nenough for gumment work!<p>Then, later, as I was considering network\ndesign for the Internet, I got an\ninterview at a network design startup in\nTexas and mentioned the problem with the\n600,000 variables.<p>Well, the whole technical staff was on the\nother side of the table, had heard the\nhorror stories about NP-complete in\ncollege, and concluded to a person that I\nwas claiming to have done the impossible\nand had to be lying.<p>I left without a job offer, and they soon\nwent out of business.<p>By the way, Mother Nature does protein\nfolding, right?  Hmm ....",1432514465

It&#x27;s a very peculiar thing but basically it was a self-fulfilling prophecy. Houses go from $100k to $120k in two years? Alright well let&#x27;s buy a house as an investment on a shitty salary, it&#x27;s free money.<p>Until everyone said that, and the rate of prices going up kept increasing, and kept reinforcing the investment opportunity myth.<p>Basic bubble, basically. And it was of course fueled by insane growth in wages.<p>I mean just look at these graphs for wage growth:\n<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/media/WAGES.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/media/WAGES.jpg</a>\n<a href=""http://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/images/Vernengo_AvgrealwagesChina.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/images/Vernengo_AvgrealwagesChina....</a><p>It&#x27;s insane. You basically had 20-30 years of 15% growth annually. 20 years of that is 16x. 30 years is 66x. It wasn&#x27;t quite 15%, but probably 10-11% on average the past 30 years. That means housing prices will naturally rise, and when they naturally rise for decades and there&#x27;s seemingly free money if you invest in a home, it&#x27;s easy for an investment bubble to arise that even outpaces wage growth.<p>Then add to that two more elements: gigantic internal migration (China has internal passports, it&#x27;s very interesting. But it doesn&#x27;t stop huge urbanisation).<p>How big? Well 25 years ago urbanisation was about 25%. Today it&#x27;s about 55%.<p>Then add to that population growth of 200 million extra people. What do you get? No joke, half a billion extra people living in cities compared to just 25 years ago, in China. That&#x27;s insane. That&#x27;s literally the entirety of North America (more than 20 countries), or all of South America times 1.5, or all of Europe and then some, living in cities, many of them existing ones.<p>And that&#x27;s how you get homes worth $200 - 400k, for Chinese who have a $7k GDP per capita, and middle class wages deviating from that only slightly higher.<p>Partially it&#x27;s alright. China will still urbanise, it will have to demolish and rebuild many buildings, and its population will add another 100m people. But on the other hand, it&#x27;s an extremely worrying asset bubble we don&#x27;t talk about enough. People forget that China was, though far from alone, in some ways quite instrumental in dampening the effects of the economic crisis. One can worry what happens if an economic crisis arises from China itself, as asset prices in some areas are just absolutely batshit insane and will have to be written off at some point, which collapses the house of cards. (selling overpriced property for nothing, which already happens but is inevitable on a larger scale, reduces all property values, who are overpriced too, escalating a major selloff that&#x27;ll leave tons of debt in its wake.

Yes, you can mix a bunch of different apps together into one. But how is one complex app better than many simple ones?\n - While social networks are basically the same in terms of functionality, the communities are different. If you mix together every social network, the community will suffer.<p>Also, I think people like having different apps for a couple reasons:<p>- Apps are modular, so you get to choose what you want. With one huge system, you get everything, whether you want it or not.\n - Apps are easy to conceptualize - &quot;In x app, I do y.&quot; It&#x27;s much harder to understand a giant system (for example, why so many people confuse gmail and google itself).",1432512628

Most of the complaints about the algorithmic timeline are implementation details, not objections to the concept itself.<p>An algorithmic timeline <i>does not necessarily mean</i> live events are out of order. There is no reason the algorithm cannot be sophisticated enough to detect time-sensitive tweets and preserve the ordering of real time events. In fact, a sophisticated enough algorithm would cluster real time event-related tweets in chronological batches, and surface relevant replies / commentary around it.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that almost all the people threatening to leave Twitter will still be there when the dust settles.",1454806798

It&#x27;s just that as jobs get worse, fewer and fewer are willing to do the job. The amount of scammers willing to do the unpleasant task of dealing with 419-eaters and Scambaiters at a particular wage goes down.<p>Free market economics tells us that as the supply of some good goes down, the price almost certainly rises, all things being equal.<p>When the supply of &quot;service&quot; reps/scammers goes down, we have 3 cases:<p>1. Demand for that labor stays the same. In this case labor rates go up. This will make scamming less economical, driving some scam factories out of business.<p>2. Demand for &quot;service&quot; reps goes up: Same as case (1), but worse for the scam factories. More of them go out of business.<p>3. Demand for &quot;sevice&quot; reps/scammers goes down: this is really a case of &quot;all things don&#x27;t stay the same&quot;, because in this case, scam factories employ fewer &quot;service&quot; reps. Maybe some scam factories leave the market, maybe all scam factories make fewer calls a day.<p>In any of the 3 cases, WE WIN! Not as many scams are perpetrated, and the amount of calls goes down. Of course, an ideological free market analysis almost always gets things either partially or wholly wrong. We also don&#x27;t know what the relationship between wages and number of people willing to put up with hobbyist scambaiters is. It&#x27;s possible that like freeways on a Saturday, even a small worsening of job conditions makes the number of people willing to work at scam factories go way down. Or not. Unknowable.

True republicans work to ensure a fair marketplace for everyone, both for poor individuals and rich corporations, providing citizens the ability to better their condition and increase their freedom.<p>Fundamental Democrats believe that the freedom of citizens is constantly at risk from outside factors, and that the government is the best agent to maintain citizen&#x27;s free will.<p>True republicans believe that human nature is fundamentally good, and that the government increases equality by maintaining a free market, while democrats suggest that human nature is often weak, requiring the government&#x27;s intervention to protect society from itself.<p>In reality, very few Republican and Democrat politicians actually represent these values.

Book companies see more people buying books, conference organizers hope for more butts in seats, industries have less stressed and healthier, happier workers. However, when jobs are threatened, any change in the status quo will be seen as a riskâ€“even those in an industry populated by people who consider themselves free of bias. It is a natural inclination to want to pull in, like the turtle into its shell, when threatened. Except in the tech industry, this â€˜pulling inâ€™ materializes as a resistance to difference.&quot;<p><a href=""http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/07/19/when-we-are-needed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/07/19/when-we-ar...</a><p>My interpretation of this is that the problems that Github has had with diversity in its teams was a leading indicator of the wider management problems that we now see.",1454804856

It is a negotiated compromise, and largely based on nationalism not the value of the individual (eg, the NHS came into existence post-war, as part of the national rebuilding. It&#x27;s beginnings very much relied on the war effort and large scale conscription having devalued individual freedom amongst the public).<p>It&#x27;s become more popular since then because it turns out to work pretty well as a system. Not so much from pure logic, as that healthcare gets more expensive over time (effectively, healthcare can exert a rent on people&#x27;s lives) and social control of healthcare is a way of putting a cap on its costs at the expense of those in healthcare who could charge much more (eg, watch the NHS junior doctors complaining about the contract changes).",1454803974

Race is more cultural than anything else.<p>Sure it starts with physical traits, but whether or not you&#x27;re black, white, or asian, does not depend on your biology. You&#x27;re actually not born that way (even if the labels make it seem like you belong to a certain geographical location, they&#x27;re just labels), and the proof is people who are of mixed race.<p>People who are half black, half white, from my experience, they choose which culture to belong to, and we all confuse it with their race. Obama is a great example. People saying he&#x27;s our &quot;black&quot; president. What? What does that really mean? He&#x27;s clearly half white, half black, so why is he a &quot;black president&quot;? That statement is inaccurate, and people should always say, he&#x27;s our first &quot;half black, half white, president&quot;. So what&#x27;s going on there? People just categorize themselves, and it&#x27;s just a matter of the stories and memes they adopt from a set of some kind of cultural background. In other words, it&#x27;s all made up. Half-white, half-black people often choose to be black because they think black is cool. They adopt that culture and roll with it.<p>So in short, if people keep categorizing themselves, there&#x27;s no way out of this. Categorization will lead to division among people. &quot;Black&quot; people are just Americans with a different <i>sub-culture</i>, that&#x27;s it. &quot;Black&quot; people are just as racially diverse among themselves as they are in comparison to &quot;white&quot; people. There are &quot;blacks&quot; from east Africa, west Africa, and Saudi Arabia. Every &quot;black&quot; group is culturally and ethnically different. Why group them?<p>I&#x27;ll recognize there is a history to be dealt with here. And that is that we&#x27;ve inherited inequality that is for the most part based on skin color (because that&#x27;s how our ignorant ancestors decided to categorize people), so that division of inequality still lingers. But there is a case for both repairing the damage, while at the same time getting everyone to forget there is any kind of racial categorization. There is only sub-cultures within American culture.",1454803587

Hopefully that will turn out to be a gloomy forecast, but it&#x27;s best to prepare for the worst.</i><p>I don&#x27;t dispute your gloom, but I challenge your %s.<p>- &quot;Well Funded Startups&quot; have a >1 correlation to the overall stock market.  (Market moves 10%, they move higher than 10%)  So if we see a several year 30-40% decline in the S&P, this will cause more than 30% of the &quot;well-funded&quot; startups to go bust.  Anyone who can&#x27;t switch to cash flow positive would have a high likelihood of going under.<p>- Real Estate values tend to move slower than stock market prices.  (People can ride the market out, and just not sell the house)  It would take a very sustained market hit to cut real estate by 30%.  Also, much of the money fleeing China is coming to the Bay Area.  (This isn&#x27;t to say that it couldn&#x27;t happen, but you&#x27;d need to see 5+ years of a depressed stock market)  The reason it tanked so much in 2008 was that the bubble was in the financing mechanism.<p>- I think if you count equity, the market rate pay for engineers would get hit worse.  Options that on-paper are worth 500K can quickly go to zero in a down round.  Other variable comp will get hit too.  Not sure about base salaries.  Even in an enormous down market, most of the world will still be short engineers.

So much so any numbers regarding race in France are simply estimates because there are no official numbers.<p>In practice so far, it hasn&#x27;t fared any better, but probably not worse either.<p>Like in the U.S., one of the biggest hindrances or obstacles to success is segregation (forced or by choice).  Wanting success essentially entails assuming the culture and practices of the successful, but for some fraction of people, being malleable and becoming like the mainstream is antithetical as it&#x27;s interpreted as &quot;giving in&quot; to the larger culture, while simultaneously wanting to be part of the larger culture and to be accepted by the larger culture.  So there is that ambivalence.<p>Personally, if I wanted to succeed in China or Mexico, I&#x27;m willing to bet I&#x27;d improve my chances by adopting local customs, manners and attitudes, rather than being steadfast about my own.  [it&#x27;s somewhat peculiar some Americans are sheepish about being &quot;too American&quot; while abroad but simultaneously believe that integration into the mainstream isn&#x27;t all that necessary.  It tells me that their brain tells them one thing, but in practice, when given the opportunity, try to be like Romans while in Rome]<p>Personally, I think people put too much stock in group identity over say, personal identity.

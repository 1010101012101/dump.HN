I have also created various scripts for automating things like configuring the SSH connection to the container, etc.<p>Another thing you have to figure out is how to edit the code. My choice was to use a volume (only in dev), and download the code into a different directory inside the container. Then on the first run, an init script inside the container will clean the volume and move the code.<p>It has been some painful months and I haven&#x27;t even finished. I&#x27;m liking where I&#x27;m going and I&#x27;m almost there, but if I had known the work it would take I think I would have avoided it. But if you are a team it&#x27;s definitely worth it. Devs can now install anything they want without asking the Ops people for permission (as you can imagine by this statement, I&#x27;m more a dev/devops than an ops guy).<p>Oh one thing that does make it awesome though is its combination with Jenkins, if you are into continuous delivery. With those two, you can easily test all kinds of environments in the same machine without wasting resources, and thanks to Docker&#x27;s cache it doesn&#x27;t have to reinstall everything every time, it&#x27;s really fast.",1402361803

All participants are separated from one another. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. The test does not check the ability to give the correct answer to questions; it checks how closely the answer resembles typical human answers.

I know it would obvious to most, but you would still need to start/stop these machines with correct docker install, firewalls rules, and probably more. The VM layer has been flushed out, but still exists and needs attention.<p>After spending more than a week looking into Docker, my one frustration with Docker is that I have not found a way to correctly develop with it. Most of the docs I see are about deploying established apps, but I would love to see tutorials about how to develop, and start from scratch with it. Does Docker stand in your way when developing or does it make it easier? Maybe a solution is to create docker wrappers for our favourite framework that would abstract Docker.

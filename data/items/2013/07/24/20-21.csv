There are things about it that are nice and things about it that are not so nice.<p>1. it requires the dongle to have equivalent internet access as the &#x27;controlling&#x27; device.  So it would seem you&#x27;d be out of luck if you wanted to stream from a mobile device using a cell modem, to a chromecast on a display in, say, a hotel, conference room or cabin without (unfiltered) wifi access to the internet.<p>2. sometimes internet-streamed video, even when possible, is far inferior to just soaking some processing power from the mobile device.  People who locally-save video content for performance/quality reasons aren&#x27;t going to be wild about it happily ignoring that local store to pull down a choppy/compressed stream.<p>3. it seems to limit the stream to codecs the device supports.  So one can&#x27;t likely chromecast from an HTPC that&#x27;s otherwise perfectly capable of streaming xvid/divx/etc.<p>multi-user queue-ing is nice.  Airplay really should pick that up.<p>But I&#x27;m not at all wild about &quot;it&#x27;s own internet stream&quot;.

Wrong. It&#x27;s cute that you know how to interpolate quaternions from memory, but that won&#x27;t make you spit out a good game. First of all, lets look at the term &quot;game programmer&quot;: this term is slightly odd -- often times, especially when just starting out, you&#x27;ll be making games in an indie environment; in such a case, you&#x27;ll need to be a good game <i>designer</i>. Making an amazing indie game is probably the best way to get in the game industry. Studying math is not.<p>I&#x27;d sum up the most important skill like this: &quot;learn how to finish projects&quot;. You can know all the math (or design) in the world, but if you can&#x27;t finish anything, no one will be impressed unless you want to be code monkey #3249 at EA (and who wants to be that?). This seems easy when read on paper, but in reality it&#x27;s fucking hard a shit. I&#x27;ve probably abandoned about 95+% of game projects I started. Anyone that says they finish more than 50% of the projects they start is full of shit. This is a skill -- and it&#x27;s by far the hardest one to hone.<p>Note that it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t approve of OP&#x27;s hard work compiling the list, I just think it perpetuates the idea that good games == good technology. Carmack is a CS genius, sure. But more importantly, he&#x27;s a damn good game designer.",1374697917

6098784,comment,6096743,6097766,4,0,DannyBee,,,"True.\nLet me expand a bit, I guess, to prevent confusion.<p>Your time bounds and what you get depends on what you mean by &quot;dead code&quot;, and how you perform it.<p>The vast majority of DCE algorithms, in books, in compilers, etc, on SSA form, have the same properties:<p>1. The &quot;bad&quot; ones are forward DCE algorithms, and do not eliminate everything they could because they process in the wrong order.<p>2. The &quot;good&quot; ones, used in most compilers, are backwards DCE algorithms, and eliminate all dead scalar code in a straight line.<p>Both are O(n).<p>The standard backwards DCE algorithm has a number of deficiencies, that cannot be eliminated sanely in O(n) time.<p>1. These DCE algorithms do not consider memory affecting statements dead unless they can prove they are non-side effecting.  Proving that is going to usually require at least some N^2 analysis somewhere.  \nThis means they miss all dead scalar code that results from a useless memory reload (second order effects),  and generally will not eliminate any dead stores.  Even though this is code, and it&#x27;s dead, it is not eliminated.<p>2. These DCE algorithms that are O(n) don&#x27;t deal with control altering statements.  Jumps to empty blocks, as well as code contained in unreachable blocks, will be considered non-dead unless you include control dependence and some form of branch evaluation.  You can compute control dependence in O(n) time. In practice, the constant sucks :)  It is also not possible to statically evaluate all branches in O(1) time, so even in the absence of memory statements you cannot guarantee you eliminate all dead code in O(n), only some of it.<p>3. These DCE algorithms do not handle partially dead code (that is, code that is dead if moved to a different place in the program, but does not otherwise affect semantics).<p>The canonical example is:<p><pre><code>  y = a + b\n  if (...) {\n    y = c + d\n  } else  {\n    ...\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe first statement is partially dead (dead along some branches), and performing assignment sinking will make it fully dead (if you sink a copy into the else branch, the original is now fully dead).<p>Performing this type of elimination is N^3 or worse, i haven&#x27;t seen better time bounds on SSA.<p>(It is not, AFAIK, completely subsumed by something like SSUPRE)<p>GCC (and I think LLVM now) actually performs the most trivial case of this, which catches a <i>very</i> large number of cases once other passes are run.<p>Well, actually, looking again, it looks like over the years it&#x27;s grown.<p>I guess nobody&#x27;s noticed it&#x27;s basically equivalent to Cliff Click&#x27;s GCM algorithm at this point, without the nice guarantees.<p>It looks like it could be trivially modified into the GCM algorithm now.<p>Time to go file a bug.",1374696763

But I don&#x27;t want to be the guy with the nail clipper.<p>Believe me, I know the feeling of wanting to zone out after a long day of work, a long commute, etc. I let it sideline my ambition for a decade.

It&#x27;s more of a folksy and over-generalized statement about the Lean Startup approach.  You can fail in any number of other ways:  developing a product that people <i>do</i> want, but not knowing how to reach the customers to let them know it exists; developing a product that people want but not at a price point that people are willing to pay; developing a product that people do want, but that isn&#x27;t sufficiently differentiated from the competition (including its substitutes, or the status-quo); etc.   If you read <i>The Four Steps To The Epiphany</i> - one of the seminal works that the Lean Startup approach is rooted in - you&#x27;ll see that there are steps in there for dealing with all of these &quot;other&quot; issues:  pricing, distribution, marketing, etc...  This  definitely goes beyond a simplistic &quot;you built something nobody wanted&quot; scenario.",1374696102

Perhaps she had plenty of HTML experience and wouldn&#x27;t regard that as coding experience. If you look at her early examples, even on something like day 3, you find the following in the source:<p><pre><code>    * Inclusion of a CSS reset stylesheet\n    * Inclusion of jQuery 1.9.1\n    * Usage of HTML5 footer tag\n    * Inclusion of the HTML5 shiv JS\n</code></pre>\nIf this wasn&#x27;t boilerplate HTML being used, I have no idea where a beginner would know these three things on day 3.

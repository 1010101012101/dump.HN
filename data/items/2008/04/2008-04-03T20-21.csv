I'm not saying that this is any better than the lisp equivalent - the lisp function is certainly more elegant.

Also, CL has a lot of built-ins so I don't find I need to write lambdas nearly as often as in other languages.  In this example, just say ""1+"".<p>Another thing you'll find is that for trivial problems, Lisp might take a few extra characters, but it scales much better.  Try making your Python lambda print the value of x first.  Try telling your Ruby lambda that x (and x+1) fits in a machine word so it can compile the function into only a couple of CPU instructions.  Try writing a metacircular evaluator in C#.  :-)<p>When you're just getting started, in any language, it doesn't really matter which implementation you pick.  (FWIW, CLISP is byte-compiled, SBCL is a native compiler, and Allegro costs $600.  Not unique to Lisp: you can find expensive proprietary C++ compilers, too.)<p>As a Lisp and Ruby programmer, I disagree that Lisp's documentation is weak.  I would be very happy if Ruby's docs were even half as good as Lisp's.<p>I type ""sudo apt-get install library-name"" for both Lisp and Python libraries, so no difference there.  (Ruby gems are less frequently packaged, and aren't compatible with the FHS, so they're a little harder.)<p>Lisp examples seem to be more often found in (dead tree) books, while Ruby and Python examples are more often found on the web.  Since Ruby and Python libraries (and even syntax) are still in flux, and Lisp predates the web, this kind of makes sense.  If you can't buy a couple books, it can be rough, though some good Lisp books are becoming available on the web for free.<p>Those symbols you picked are a little weird, but when's the last time you actually saw a cdadr?  It is at least consistent (which is more than can be said for some languages!).  I don't find ""unshift"" or ""__gt__"" any better.<p>I don't want to sound like a pure apologist.  I admit that Slime is an investment (if you don't already know Emacs).  Apparently there is a Lisp plugin for Eclipse, but I know nothing about it.  It is a shame more IDEs don't support Lisp well, though I can see why they don't.<p>Finally, it could be simply that Lisp doesn't map well to your mind.  (I don't mean this as an insult -- everybody's different.  Maybe Smalltalk or Prolog or Sisal is your cup of tea.)  I don't think Ruby maps well to mine, though I know some people who seem like Matz reincarnate -- which could explain why the docs are so sparse!

154201,comment,153805,153952,0,0,gruseom,,,"I think what you're describing may be in a different class than the products the OP is castigating. The latter are not vertical systems. They're middleware that the client expects to integrate with existing systems (paying huge consulting bills in the process, though they may not know it yet). And once that integration is done, then magic happens and the productivity boost is supposed to kick in.<p>What you're describing sounds more like an in-house framework that is used to boost <i>your</i> company's efficiency in delivering systems to customers. That's different. When you're doing a lot of similar projects, abstracting out the common parts can be a big win. I've seen this succeed, up to a point.<p>I say ""up to a point"" because I've noticed a pattern. Sooner or later the vendor decides that their in-house framework is so great that they've really solved the problem of enterprise software development in general. Now they ""just"" need to package it up as a platform.<p>The problem with this is that the value is not in the framework, it's in the team that's built up around the framework. The framework may make <i>you</i> more efficient (""you"" meaning the programmers, managers, analysts who know it, identify with it, and belong to an organization based on it), but it doesn't follow that it will make others more efficient, because the framework abstracted away from <i>you</i> is not the same thing at all. The overhead for anybody else to use it is considerably greater and may (and usually does) exceed the benefit.<p>Vendors do this because they want to shift away from being a consulting company (where the product is you, and the framework is your secret weapon) to being a product company (where the product is the framework and the ""you"" part is vastly diminished, ideally to zero). Of course even in the success stories (SAP?) the consulting role is still huge.

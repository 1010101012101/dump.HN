I couldn&#x27;t give a tinker&#x27;s cuss if you do or don&#x27;t.  Generally though, if you don&#x27;t want to look like a fool, it&#x27;s best not to express an opinion about a piece you haven&#x27;t read.<p>The claim you are so hostile to is actually not even particularly controversial.  It&#x27;s a conditional statement for one thing (you don&#x27;t even read an introduction carefully) and it&#x27;s easily defended.  It&#x27;s a fact that no currency has ever been widely adopted without having some kind of intrinsic or government mandated value.  Plain, historical fact.  Bitcoin has no intrinsic or government mandated value.  So if it gains widespread adoption, then I don&#x27;t see how you could possibly deny the historical significance of this.  A large amount of economic orthodoxy goes out the window.<p>If you are willing to address this argument, I&#x27;m willing to listen.  But if you&#x27;re just here to beat your chest and get all alpha on me then I might point out you&#x27;re better off hitting the gym and cruising the bars.

We pair program, practice TDD, and learn something new\nevery day. We solve the problems of managing a distributed, part time\nworkforce using a web application and automated telephony system; the system\nmakes sure our customers can get the help they need, when they need it, and\nthat our students can work when they want. Solving these problems means we&#x27;re\nworking with Geospatial data and services, telephony systems, and, in\nsome cases, integrating with University systems. We strive to make the\nprocess of moving painless for customers, while providing solid jobs\nfor our hard working college students.<p>What does Bellhops do?\n---\nBellhops employs top-tier college students to provide moving\nservices to our collegiate and local communities in over 100 cities. With\nthousands of trained student &#x27;Bellhops&#x27;, access to a nationwide fleet\nof moving trucks and our fully integrated Online Management System,\nwe’re taking small local moving and giving her the People&#x27;s Elbow.<p>Where do you fit in?\n---\nWe currently develop in Django, but we&#x27;d love to talk to any web\ndeveloper who&#x27;s eager to learn.

By your logic, people wouldn&#x27;t pay money for Windows, or Photoshop, or thousands of other software packages.  Oh, and Steam!  People pay $20 or more on Steam for some mediocre stuff.<p>The problem with paying for apps is two-fold: Frankly, 99% of apps out there aren&#x27;t worthy of my money.  Most of the few I actually pay for (Spotify and LastPass come to mind), I don&#x27;t pay for for the app, it&#x27;s for the service behind the app.<p>Second, app developers have done this to themselves, in two ways - first, putting out just really shitty, awful apps (especially games) that aren&#x27;t worth money.<p>Also, in perpetuating a race to the bottom and setting the expectations way too low on price.  I saw somewhere that Jobs thought the perfect price point for an app is $10 (I might be wrong on the source, but someone said it).  I agree with this.  If you really believe you have a great app, price that shit accordingly.  If you have a great app and price it at $10, if you get a third of the downloads you&#x27;d get at $3, you&#x27;re still ahead.  And, your users will feel like part of an exclusive club, and invite their friends to be part of it.<p>Of course, this is my opinion, and no one ever listens to me.",1393334677

A few years ago I played the game &quot;explain the Higgs boson to a math mayor&quot; a few times and I always lost.<p>Some problems with the comic:<p>* In the frame (8,1) there is a W particle over a balance. The Higgs boson is useful to &quot;explain&quot; the inertial mass, not the gravitational mass. This is nickpicking, but it&#x27;s also shows that we don&#x27;t have the correct words in the common language to talk about the Higgs boson.<p>*  In the frame (9,3) says that all the particles should interact with the Higgs field. Really, the massless particles like photon and gluons don&#x27;t interact with the Higgs field. And the details of the interactions of the others particles are very different. The W, Z particles interact in a different way than the quarks and electron/muou/tau. And the neutrinos probably interact in a different way. To fix the frame, it&#x27;s enough to change &quot;had to&quot; to &quot;may&quot;.<p>* In frame (11,1) it use the &quot;molasses&quot; word. The problem is that the canonical property of molasses is viscosity, and the Higgs fields don&#x27;t create a viscosity equivalent. An electron can travel forward as long as it wants, but a ball in molasses stops soon. I think that it&#x27;s impossible to give a correct explanation of the Higgs boson using the word &quot;molasses&quot;.<p>* In frames (11,1)-(11,2) it apparently shows that without the Higgs boson, all the particles would not interact. But really the other interactions are independent of the Higgs boson.<p>EDIT: (10,1) -> (11,1) and (10,2) -> (11,2)",1393333679

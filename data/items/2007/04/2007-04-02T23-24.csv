but being unable to escape connectivity makes useless for most users offline web apps...and i think having to use offline web app (a term that really sounds wrong) would just add frustration",1175558104

The interests match, and he has lots of good content.",1175558017

Norton Antivirus is using IWebBrowser, Skype i think is uzing Mozzila's...
Applications like Skype could never be developed using anything else than the perfomance of native compiled C/C++. And if not compiled, they could never use tricks to stop you from debugging Skype...",1175557870

8358,comment,8236,8236,0,0,volida,,,"I somehow agree and I wondered why all this excitement for offline access of applications. Of course syncing and having offline backup of your information is good but, nowadays, they only way to escape being online is by choosing it. I am aware of flights over atlantic that have wifi...<p>Really, how many times in your life did you find yourself offline and needing to use a web application? And if you did find yourself offline most probably you are without your pc or your mobile which means you end up using another device.<p>Oops! That means no access to that trendy offline application you installed the other day! <p>Everyone is moving inside the web, not outside it.<p>Go Grid!<p>P.S
And I think now I am getting it! Thaaat was the sarcasm from Google with GMail Paper!",1175556532

How much of your time would you spend on each?  They had the idea so they deserve a premium but if you will spend just as much time as them on it, that premium is all that separates you from them. <p>Commitement matters. As important as ideas are, without commitement and execution, they are nothing.",1175555734
8355,comment,8278,8278,0,0,domp,,,"Once they start giving the artist's a bigger cut of the prices then I'll start to care. Right now 35% is going towards Apple, and I'm sure EMI is seeing about 70% of each sale. I couldn't care less if EMI and Apple make more money off of their artists and consumers. The whole DRM thing was bound to fail anyways.",1175555646

8353,comment,8220,8222,0,0,jward,,,"Equity is ownership of the company.  It is everything that that the company is after all debts have been settled.  Stock is the way this is represented.  So the percent of equity you have is the percent of stock you have.<p>The only time it translates into money for you is when it is sold or dividends are declared.  Generally, the percent of the equity you have is the percent of the cash you get.<p>I would recommend talking with your cofounders about how you want to split it up.  Remember that YC will take a small chunk of it as well.  I'm sure if you're accepted there will be  help with understanding it all. <p>If you want a generic recommendation, take a chunk and set it aside then divide the reset evenly amongst the cofounders.",1175555533

Quick patent searches on these let us know whether there is something out there identical or similar to what we are doing at a macro scale. Keep in mind, patents are worded in lawyer-speak so we can't say there is nothing out there until spending a lot more time & resources (lawyer money).<p>It is fairly common to find that little things you do are patentable so focusing on the big things will keep your task manageable.",1175555343

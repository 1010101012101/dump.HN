We decided on Python because it would give all 3 something to learn (and to help to bond) but ultimately its ended up being more powerful than we all imagined.  <p>The main thing for you is just to get on and get started",1198313358

Just write it, open the editor and make the first page, then the second and so on. Get the site built so that it works. Don't worry about scalability, you'll need to rewrite it anyway. <p>Choose rails if the guy who loves rails wants to write the the majority of the app, otherwise write it in php. <p>It would be best if you two sat together while you wrote the it, that way you can figure out if you can work together, or not.",1198313090

91943,comment,91140,91471,0,0,Goladus,,,"There's a lot of humor in pg's essays but overall Yegge is more consistently funny and often downright hilarious.  He'll often have a valid point, but equally important is the goal of presenting that point in an entertaining way.  I think of it less as fluff and more of a tasty cream filling.  Yegge has an exceptional sense of comic timing in writing, and sometimes it takes a bit of buildup.<p>Imagine a kingdom of nouns and verbs, where nouns have lots of rights and verbs are oppressed.  Imagine replacing all the verbs with just one verb, 'execute!'  Get it?  Verb/execute/oppression?? I guess not, not when I try to cram all the ideas into 2 sentences.  Sure it takes Yegge a page or so to get there, but the payoff is a hearty laugh.",1198310864

Every large brokerage has a dark pool. I wonder if there will be consolidation there; it's anyone's guess at this point.<p>As for network effects, Reg NMS requires an exchange to route an order to a rival if the rival has published a better price. So network effects are less important than you might think outside the dark pools. The features that really attract market makers are things like fees and likelihood of getting a fill (ie, priority rules).",1334696305

Andy Rubin directed all GPL code (all that was practical, anyway) to be removed from the Android userspace out of fear of IP purity concerns.  And in the process of all that forking he did deep harm to the open source community.  Not just code was forked, but infrastructure was abandoned: compare the level of robustness and transparency of Fedora/Debian/Ubuntu/OpenSUSE packaging to that of the ""I cooked a ROM, download it here!"" culture in the android world.<p>Yet Rubin allowed the use of the developer tools of a clearly proprietary product from another company without batting an eyelash.

In particular, nerds find the bulleted lists collegial and painless to read; if they're skimming, they find medium-length well-written prose grafs slightly (or significantly) more painful. Remember that these are the same people who will write ""tl;dr"" comments on message boards.<p>Having said that, if you're recruiting for nerd jobs, you'd better be selling from the jump. The lede in this blog post is absolutely correct. There's a fierce market out there for strong talent. If your job post is a short blurb about your company and a list of boring requirements, then Jamie is right: that post isn't doing anything for you.<p>So I think you take a middle ground: write pithy bulleted text, but make the bullets sell. Nerds like ""concrete"". It helps to know that some technical ""requirements"" sell a job, and others don't: an ""Experience in Java and J2EE environments"" bullet is going to hurt you, but a ""Comfortable learning to build complex systems in Scala and Postgres"" probably picks up points.<p>But the best advice on this thread I think traces to Jamie: whatever bullets you write, they should <i>sell the job</i>. If you can sell the job, you'll get good candidates, and screening them manually won't be a pain.<p>Here's how I'd do ours in this hybrid style (we're always hiring, FWIW) --- this isn't how I'd normally write a job ad (I don't want my postings to look like job ads), but just to illustrate:<p>-------------------------<p>Matasano is a trusted security advisor to many of the industry's most interesting companies. We do application security: companies pay us to find startling new ways to break their applications. We're looking for someone who could work at any of the best software companies in the world to join a team breaking apps at all the best software companies in the world.<p>Things to know about us:<p>* Founded in 2005 and profitable many years running<p>* Offices in NYC, Chicago, and SFBA<p>Specific things we're looking for:<p>* <i>Ability and enthusiasm for coding.</i> Our day-to-day is solving security problems with code.<p>* <i>Total lack of fear.</i> Our teams switch on a dime from attacking electronic trading markets to reverse engineering compiled code on FPGA-synthesized CPUs. We don't need you to know how to write a Dalvik decompiler or write a fuzzer for the MongoDB wire protocol. We just need you to want to know how.<p>* <i>Deep interest in appsec.</i> People who are good at breaking apps love breaking apps.<p>* <i>Fluent with web stacks.</i> From HTTP to Javascript to the rendering quirks of Webkit, and on through Rails and Django, and how their ORMs work. You'd want to to understand low-level web development well enough so that you could figure out a new stack in hours, not days.<p>* <i>Comfort with C programming.</i> Appreciated but not required. If you don't know C, we'll want to teach it to you.<p>Benefits:<p>* Working in an office culture with a team of people who write debuggers for fun and leaving the office every day in time to have dinner with your family.<p>* High probability that you'll learn more in this role than any role you've had prior. This year we've written clients for trading protocols, implemented exploit code for cryptanalytic attacks, exploited browser memory corruption bugs, stuffed Riak clusters full of HTTP requests, built a large scale fuzzing farm for Windows desktop software, language runtimes, linkers, kernel modules, iPhone apps, and chipset fuzzers.<p>* Unlimited free books. You get an Amazon account. You see a book, you buy the book, it's yours. Write your name on it, take it home.<p>* Market comp, bonuses for speaking at conferences, medical, dental, 401k<p>Interested? We wrote down everything we could think of about our hiring process at <a href=""http://www.matasano.com/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matasano.com/careers</a>. Our contact information is there. YOU CANNOT WASTE OUR TIME. We're happy just to talk to you about our field.<p>-------------------------<p>Notes:<p>* This is way longer than I'd write a job post, but in the same word count ballpark as the ""bulleted list"" example from Jamie's post. (I also wrote it extemporaneously so give me a break on grammar and clarity).<p>* There are bullets but none of them are intended to screen candidates. It's my job to screen, the bullet's job is to invite.<p>* There are buzzwords but, like I think every good tech job post, the script is flipped: I'm <i>selling</i> with them, not using them to exclude people with a regex on their resume.<p>* ""You cannot waste our time"". #1 thing that freaks me out about our job ads: are people reading them and thinking ""These guys won't think I'm qualified for the role so why bother applying"". Some of our best hires had no previous professional track record in our field.<p>* Tech-forward: we're recruiting gifted low-level developers, so we're not talking about changing the world or revolutionizing our industry or the exhilaration of working in a fast-paced startup environment. We're talking (I hope!) about awesome technical challenges.<p>* Yes, I am totally cheating by sneaking a job ad into an HN comment. On the other hand: HN is one of our top recruiting vectors, and we're bigger than most YC companies, so I think I might have some actionable intel on how to recruit from HN. :)",1334694738

I've seen this setup in a lab being run from one CMTS. The modem has a service flow for Internet (say 50Mbit/sec) and another for the eSTB (say 30Mbit/sec) which can handle the IP VOD and IP multi-cast video. It is possible to have multiple CMTSs for this however both Cisco and Motorola are investing in VDOC (video-over-DOCSIS) scale solutions that allow you to put all your eggs into one huge basket. One cable modem / gateway will ultimately be feeding every cable service in your home and some portion of it will be provisioned for plain ole' Internet traffic while the rest of it will be allocated for MSO services. From what I can tell this is <i>not</i> how Comcast is delivering IP VOD to the Xbox today. I would expect them to make the transition fairly quickly though. This stuff has been up and running in labs for the last 5+ years. MSOs are just very slow to adopt new technology.",1334694683

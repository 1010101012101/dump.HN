1485411,comment,1484604,1485030,0,0,baguasquirrel,,,"In hindsight, the biggest benefit for me, from going to college was not the CS program. It was that the CS program actually had some really good hackers--still to date the friendliest and smartest lot of hackers I'd met outside a few particularly good Haskell meetups. So it's not mutually exclusive.<p>The second biggest benefit was that I was introduced to psychology as a science, and not some pseudo-intellectual horsing around as it was made out to be in high school. Ditto for economics. Taken together with the other cultural studies I dropped in on, it was something that's been fairly difficult to replicate now that I'm out of school. I'm actively trying to recreate at least some part of that experience now (using technology of course ;).<p>The clincher is that my alumni meetups have been nowhere near as enlightening as college was. I sometimes wonder if some people took boring pills during graduation, or if it really was the diversity that brought it out in people.<p>In all, college is what you make of it, just like real life.",1278233837

What you're describing, site, marketing, research, etc are all important, but they all seem ancillary to the project itself. Have you considered working as a consultant or freelancer doing these things?\nI guess what I'm trying to say here is that if you do what you're suggesting with your ideas, I don't know that they'd  really be YOUR projects anymore, I think they'd end up being something you played a supporting role making.

So, to get me going, using CLTL[1] as reference, I watched the videos first. Its about 20-24 hours worth of watching. Following this I started reading the book and implementing the exercises and the projects in the chapters (register machine, logic programming etc.) in Common Lisp. That required me to understand the concepts well enough to port the scheme stuff to common lisp. This way I ended up learning Common Lisp with a decent grasp of Scheme.<p>Note that common lisp comes with a lot of stuff built in, but to do the above I stuck to a minimal subset.<p>Following this, it was fun to read OnLisp[2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ida.liu.se/imported/cltl/cltl2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ida.liu.se/imported/cltl/cltl2.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html</a>",1278233447

It's only sent back by the client when it needs to tell the server it is maintaining a certain state. In the case of CSS, there's no state to maintain, so Cookies are certainly supposedly useless.

1485382,comment,1483583,1483583,0,0,anonman1,,,"I had an understanding of what meditation was while on an acid trip. Some people who've done lsd describe a spiritual experience which they experience. I can say I had a good experience. What I felt was an experience of me and everything around me moving as one. That is to say the universe and I are connected to one another. It is an experience which is difficult to articulate, but something which one feels. This experience is largely missing in the sensory experience of everyday life.<p>However, one of the better parts of my experience was watching the plants. Their movement as one is what one is attempting to mimic in meditation. Plants are immensely connected to the world in a way we are not. Mimicking them is how we can connect ourselves to the same feeling. This mimicking of plants is what I feel meditation is. It is why it became easier for me to meditate after doing lsd than before as the reasoning behind it makes much more sense.<p>Some things which helped me understand meditation at a deeper level are:<p>* Bhagavad Gita - The last couple of chapters make more sense. The whole I am everything was a bit annoying before, but it makes more sense when you get the point. If everything is One, then everything is beautiful.<p>* Foucault's The Subject and Power or anything Foucault - Meditation is supposed to break the chains our desire. Foucault's The Subject and Power is immensely powerful in understanding that we are all part of a system and governed by rules. Humans are by no means free but are held together by a discursive power which we are unaware of. One of the things we are supposed to realize is how we are entrapped by these rules and gain the ability to break rules.<p>If you think this is all tripe please feel free to ignore it.

X number of graduate level credits per Y years to renew a state teaching license, along with ""most"" districts having a tuition reimbursement benefit AND dramatically increased pay per educational level in the union contract.  Its possible for a 22 yr old teacher to only have a BA-Ed but its almost impossible for a teacher with more than 5 yrs experience not to have a masters or higher.  Usually in a completely useless unrelated topic making it unusual and noteworthy that my high school calc teacher actually got his education doctorate by doing some relatively hard core research into quantitative comparative results of different techniques of teaching kids some small aspect of calc, which he was in fact really good at.  Usually completely unrelated in that I had an english lit teacher who had a masters in history and her thesis was some really obscure corner.  It turns out that demanding credentials and therefore handing them out like toilet paper doesn't magically make anyone smarter or more effective, but a lot of money is made in the process, so it'll continue and expand until it can't anymore.",1364821169

5472651,comment,5468525,5469198,9,0,VLM,,,"""your tuition/room/board/books will be absolutely free.""<p>You do not know that.  You simply do not.  The kids/family are operating from a fear reaction.  Some years ago there was a study about why more poor people have (pre-video on demand) cable TV than phone.  The paper's conclusion was you could predict and budget the cable bill to the penny, other than traditional low yearly increases, but you can never predict next months phone bill, all you need is some 900 number calls or lots of long distance (back when that was expensive) and that means you literally cannot afford to pay the bill this month, hit to credit report, collectors calling, maybe disconnected (so why bother connecting to begin with...).  Whoops.  Plenty of poor families can survive a stable $25 cable bill every month for basic cable but not a phone bill that might semi-randomly be $10 this month and $125 next month.  Therefore out of fear sign up for the devil you know rather than the devil you don't know.<p>""No crippling student loans""  You sure about that?  Guarantee that no aid package to any poor kid in the country would contain loans as part of the package?  That is definitely not how it used to be.  In the old days you'd absolutely have loans as part of the package.  If you get a $125K/yr software dev job, $20K of loans is small, but if you are one of the majority who drop out, or get a financially nonviable degree in a field with high new grad unemployment, that kind of loan could destroy you and your family.  Much safer to go to state-U.<p>What you meant to write is something like a $40K/yr family can send a kid to a $60K/yr school and get a completely unknown and utterly unpredictable but probably rather large amount of help which might even approach the total cost of attendance but you'll never know until you sign up and it might vary from year to year and certainly will vary from school to school.  Its not unusual for a low income family to have roughly 100% of their income already budgeted and no substantial access to loans, so teasing the family with $57K of ""help"" at a $60K school is useless if the family can't scrape up $3K extra per year.  If they could scrape up $3K/yr they would probably already spend it on health insurance, or maybe car insurance, or food, or dentistry, or ... So assuming there's an infinite pool of available cash is unrealistic.  On the other hand if state-U wants $4K but guarantees loan availability, the kid seems infinitely better off going to state-U because the tuition bill can actually be paid (with a loan ... but paid nonetheless)",1364819860

Compared to that, MOOCs are already far superior. Should the working world move towards portfolio-based hiring, which seems to get more and more common, then a great many universities will find it hard to justify their existence.

I respect that many people wished this was not the case.<p>3)  Many investors in the Valley, whose opinions are quite relevant given that one cannot self-fund employee salaries, are of the opinion that outsourcing development work suggests a tech company which will never achieve the path to $100 million in revenue followed by a $N billion valuation, which is what their business model counsels them to search for.  They would point out &quot;I cannot think of a single company whose product was not produced in-house in history which achieved that&quot; and they would not be far from wrong.<p>4)  Managing outsourced development is a skill, and its a skill that most companies and individuals suck at, and do not particularly wish to become great at.<p>5)  It is the widespread perception in the American tech industry that BPO companies produce software whose quality is abominable and that the process of dealing with them is pathological, as evidenced by the fact that only companies which institutionally hate software and software people are willing to work with BPO companies.  Many in the American tech industry do not hate software or software people, and thus would have a very high bar to be convinced to use a BPO company.",1424181584

I am not talking about whether you inserted <i>n</i> integers or updated so many varchar columns -- when you actually monitor its IO, it is <i>extremely</i> unlikely that your database exceeds 100GB a day of writes, and in all likelihood is a magnitude or two below this. Whenever anyone waves their hands and talks about databases as if they somehow imply massive use, they&#x27;re just fearmongering -- actual empirical stats are your friend, and actual empirical stats show that most real-world databases barely register on the lifespan of most SSDs.<p>So now that we&#x27;re in an understanding that we&#x27;re talking about database <i>writes</i> to IO, the other matter is how it writes it. I&#x27;ve built a lot of systems on a lot of databases, and the write amplification has generally been <i>very</i> low. I&#x27;ve been building and running significant databases on SSDs for about 7 years now, and while everyone else is finally starting to realize that they&#x27;re wasting their time if they aren&#x27;t, we still see the sort of <i>extreme</i> niche fearmongering that makes other people clutch onto their magnetic storage (and I heard it the entire time. &quot;OMG but don&#x27;t databases kill flash???!?!?&quot;. No, certain volumes of writes and types of writes do. Only metering will tell you if that applies). Yes, some people do very odd things that can kill storage, but that is extremely rare.

1) You want developers in-house because they&#x27;re creating your product. This generates your revenue, so you want to be intimately involved (not outsourced).

9062157,comment,9061901,9062029,0,0,offgridquest,,,"Lithium batteries are not only lighter, but smaller.  The typical home today to go off grid in the U.S. is a tiny house or a motorhome.  The reason is, it&#x27;s very cost prohibitive for the amount of power you need.  Batteries are the most expensive part of that equation.  If you live in a 3000 sq foot house and run a $250 per month electric bill, it might take 50 $130 golf cart batteries to power your house for a day or two, and you replace them every 4-5 years.  Or you could go with Iron Edison batteries that should last a lifetime.  They are equivalent to about 4 golf cart batteries, and the only requirement is to re-fill them with liquid.  They cost about $4,000 each, and are yet still very heavy.  The lithium batteries will take up about 1/5 the size and even less weight, and should last much longer than the golf cart batteries, but not as long as the Iron Edison.  But space and weight requirements down so much will bring down costs with overseas shipping and trucking bills to a minimum compared with the alternatives.  Think what great success in small batteries has done for cell phones.  Not that your home needs to be mobile, but I see cars with solar panels and homes with solar shingles... both always charging.... as a great use of the sun as an energy source.",1424181099

Up to this point, such grayware could hide behind the argument that some user action implied consent to the add-on installation. With this new change, that is no longer possible. It is almost as easy for such grayware to silently modify the Firefox binary directly, so from a security standpoint this change does not really contribute much. However, such modification to the Firefox binary (or a similar action) is much more obviously malware than side loading an extension is. So Mozilla is trying to gain leverage against bad actors who are trying to pose as legitimate actors. The problem with an opt-out is that grayware could silently activate the opt-out and claim that such an action was implied by the installation of the grayware.<p>That said, Mozilla has also said that they will release an unbranded version of Firefox that does not include the add-on signing restriction but is otherwise identical.

If your engineers are used to working with both, having both available costs way less than making them do mental gymnastics to get around not having it, although that might take itself out in onboarding time or code complexity or whatever. But mostly not, if you have good interfaces set up like Patrick.<p>P.S. - Don&#x27;t put sessions in Memcached, ever. Having users sessions die randomly because you used too much RAM is terrible design. Putting them in Redis is fine, in which case you probably want to set an expires property when they&#x27;re created & update it when they&#x27;re read.

Sometimes we actively pursue a direction, &quot;developing my back-end-skills/archictecture&quot; and sometimes we are more/less forced in a direction &quot;this needs testing/documentation&quot;. The result is a traveled path which is &quot;my experience&quot;, and a direction which is my &quot;desired trajectory forward&quot;.<p>Matching would then be a spatial questions: Have you been [here]?

Safer to be a young dude at Los Alamos than an average age dude in the midwest.<p>Interesting anecdote, the carpenter died the morning after Hiroshima.  Most real world cover ups are not x-files show material but tend toward &quot;the driver was up really late at the party last night&quot;.  And it is interesting given the modern puritan attitude toward drunk driving that this was the only accident where blame was assigned.  I would not be surprised if the driver had been out late the night before celebrating and the foreman did not take that into account thus getting recommended for firing.  Or it was the foreman who was still drunk from the night before, leading directly to the carpenters death and destruction of .gov property.",1424178246

Most companies would output reports from their HRIS systems in wildly different formats, and you&#x27;d have to adjust for industry, geo/currency, year, gender/ethnicity/language, and all sorts of things.  But just getting that data and the sensitivity that goes with it would be near-impossible unless you were a salary survey company.  And then, they get job-level data and not per employee.  They charge serious money for the services of analyzing this data and do not make their data available.",1424178104

Part of rebuilding the website is updating the layout and usability of the website.

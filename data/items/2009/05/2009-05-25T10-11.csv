So if one story makes it to the front page in the past 24 hours, news submissions from the same site are disabled.<p>The time period can be manipulated (12 hours, one week, whatever).<p>This will limit the effect of TC and a few other sites that are very frequent front-pagers without merit IMHO.",1243248874

(And, by extension, yourself, since you're not even a woman.)<p>That's unproductive and leads to - guess what! - women being not taken seriously, and being avoided because well-meaning men will assume everything they say will cause offense, and women not getting hired or picked because they make everyone else uncomfortable.<p>Isn't that ironic?<p>You also treat all women the same when you presume to speak for them. That's just more plain old sexism dressed up in a suit of righteousness.<p>I hate people grouping me with all other breast-and-vagina people, and assuming I like them, and agree with them, and share their agenda... and support them speaking on <i>my</i> behalf, as if we are all alike.<p>If you want to create change, you have to stop whining, stop laying blame, stop pointing fingers and saying ""YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN THEY CALL OBJECTS 'GUYS'!!!!"" and do useful, productive things. This is not it.<p>For what it's worth, men in IT are more likeable than women, because when men fail, they don't blame it on other people's oppression of them due to their sexual equipment.",1243248599

We don't need reposts to HN for every new blurb that comes along. Rarely there is an interesting tidbit that merits discussion here. Rarely. We don't really need to use HN as an aggregator.<p>That said, the voting system does a decent job of keeping excessive TC off the front page.

625255,story,,,82,129,andr,"Poll: Should we ban TechCrunch?",,"Ask YC: Ban TechCrunch?<p>I know this was discussed a few months ago, but I think TechCrunch has significantly changed for the worse over that time. It is too biased and unprofessional to serve the important role in the startup community that it has assumed. My 3 problems with TechCrunch are:<p>1) Strong negative bias<p>TechCrunch has started personal vendettas against Last.fm (http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/22/deny-this-lastfm/ http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/20/did-lastfm-just-hand-over-user-listening-data-to-the-riaa/ http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/23/another-blanket-denial-by-lastfm/) where they continously bring strongly trust anonymous reports but practically ignore official statements from Last.fm and CBS. Furthermore, all those posts were made entirely based on anonymous sources, without reaching the Last.fm/CBS parties for comment.<p>2) Strong positive bias<p>The last 500 posts on TechCrunch contain 1200 mentions of Twitter. Twitter is clearly getting more TC coverage than any other startup in existence. Twitter and Twitter Search are always mentioned as a source, but you'd never see the phrase ""a Google search reveals.."". On top of that, TC covers random and uninmportant events such as a 104-year old woman using Twitter (followed by a denial), an astronaut using Twitter (followed by a denial), a cat using Twitter, Kanye West not being happy with Twitter, ad nauseam.<p>3) Censorship<p>There are reports of people that had their comments deleted from TC because they argued againt TC's position. The most recent example is http://twitter.com/alexmuller/status/1903186356<p>Should TechCrunch be banned from News.YC?",1243247909

625242,comment,625034,625198,0,0,noonespecial,,,"<i>Think about it, in the ER, we are trained and prepared to save lives in a heart attack, keep you alive long enough to have an operation if you get shot in the chest, or administer antidotes in case you get bitten by a rattle snake. We have all that equipment lying around just in case, and we're trained to use it. But, many of our patients have ear infections, runny noses, back aches and sore throats. Not exactly cost effective care.</i><p>That's one of the biggest goofs of the American medical system. Trying to treat catastrophic care and routine care in exactly the same way makes it difficult to craft a system that works. The right insurance policy to pay a $50,000 accidental injury claim is not the right policy to get $25 worth of tetracycline. In trying to combine an <i>insurance policy</i> against large unforeseen medical costs with a prepaid, tax-free, employer sponsored routine care <i>spending account</i>, we've created an ungainly monster that just about does neither. Like those ridiculous ""boat-cars"" they tried to build in the 60's. Look! Its a boat and a car! No, its a car that barely drives and a boat that barely floats.",1243246619
625241,comment,625168,625184,0,0,jd,,,"The problem with operators is that they have a binding strength. If you want the expression 7 + x * 4 to evaluate correctly operator * must be stronger than operator +. If programmers can define their own operators they'll either have to supply binding strength as a numeric parameter (ugly) or relative to other operators. For instance, you could have a list of operators per class type, where the first operator in the list is the strongest, and the last operator the weakest. You can then insert your operator in the ""right"" place in the list to specify the strength. This is a reasonable solution, but you'll run into different problems when two libraries each define operators on the same types. Either way it's not going to be an elegant solution.<p>It also is a problem on the grammar level. The expression 5--x is ordinarily parsed as 5 - (-x). But if you were to introduce an operator -- the meaning of that statement would change to 5 -- x. So the introduction of user defined operators can change the meaning of an expression.<p>Overloading and user defined operators is a hairy, hairy topic, and the ""anything goes"" approach is not necessarily the right solution.",1243246541

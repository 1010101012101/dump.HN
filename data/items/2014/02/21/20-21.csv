I am fairly comfortable with it and my only disappointment is that I do not get to use it often.<p>The ability to solve a problem in a particular programming language is often dependent on the ability to express the problem in the constructs provided by the language. A very good example is the problem of concurrency. Doing something concurrently in a primarily procedural/OOP language often seems hacky and it is something that does not feel natural. The actor model that erlang implements is a very powerful model for certain class of problems and concurrency is one of them. Erlang the language, minus the OTP, is extremely small and once you get over the culture shock experienced when it comes to syntax, things will seem pretty easy. OTP isn&#x27;t magic. Its years and years of erlang experience packaged into one neat library, solving commons problems, so that you can concentrate on your work instead of reinventing the wheel.<p>Reading Joe Armstrong thesis &#x27;Making reliable distributed systems in the presence of software errors&#x27;[1] is highly recommended if you want to understand why things are the way they are.<p>[1] : <a href=""http://www.erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf</a>",1393015906

I think the decentralization of technology point is key and underappreciated. Technology makes dystopia harder to maintain, not easier. In feudal times, someone who wanted to overthrow an oppressive tyrant had the very uphill battle of gathering together a large enough army of soldiers to create an effective resistance.

It’s a consequence of making the proof of work computationally intensive. If computation is minimized in favor of random access to gigabytes of memory (incurring long latencies), then mining will require large investments in RAM but relatively little power.<p>Cuckoo Cycle represents a breakthrough in three important ways:<p>1) it performs only one very cheap siphash computation for about 3.3 random accesses to memory,<p>2) its memory requirement can be set arbitrarily and doesn&#x27;t allow for any time-memory trade-off.<p>3) verification of the proof of work is instant, requiring 1 sha256 and 42 siphash computations.<p>Runtime in Cuckoo Cycle is completely dominated by memory latency. It promotes the use of commodity general-purpose hardware over custom designed single-purpose hardware.<p>Other features:<p>4) proofs take the form of a length 42 cycle in the Cuckoo graph.<p>5) it has a natural notion of (base) difficulty, namely the number of edges in the graph; above about 60% of size, a 42-cycle is almost guaranteed, but below 50% the probability starts to fall sharply.<p>6) running time for the current implementation on high end x86 is under 24s/GB single-threaded, and under 3s/GB for 12 threads.<p>7) making cuckoo use a significant fraction of the typical memory of a botnet computer will send it into swap-hell, and likely alert its owner.",1393015244

This experience has completely changed my life and I&#x27;m incredibly happy that I got a second chance in life to live a better life. These situations happen because people learn and focus on how to manage the outside world but hardly anyone knows how to manage the inner world. Furthermore, most people don&#x27;t talk about the stress or their fears and thoughts that torture them, not even with their spouses. The bad thing is that you can easily identify the first signs of depression or burnout and counter it with therapeutic measures, yet so many end up completely burned out.<p>You don&#x27;t even have to pay a therapist, our minds can be trained to build extremely powerful therapeutic algorithms to avoid these situations. After my experience I quit my job as a business subordinate and started building a tool to help others manage their inner world better so that they hopefully don&#x27;t end up where I did. Our approach is heavily scientific (we have two ongoing PhD projects to investigate and test our program) and we have just started out.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to connect with anyone who wants to share their experiences and thoughts on this topic. If you feel like it, drop me a line at: julian@appnroll.com If you are stuck in depression or a burnout and feel like breaking down, please don&#x27;t hesitate to contact me, too - sometimes you just need to talk to someone.

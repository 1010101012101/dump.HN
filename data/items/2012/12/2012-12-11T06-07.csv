4903430,comment,4902963,4903314,9,0,brc,,,"Leverage is the only way to larger returns.  This is true whether you go from a 1 person company to a 2 person company, whether you borrow or take equity to expand a company, or whether you borrow to fund a house.<p>Without leverage, you're getting nowhere.  Employing a person is using leverage - you're betting that the employee will generate more revenue than they cost to keep.<p>Buying a house with leverage is neither dumb nor smart.  It is a strategy.  Strategies only become successful or failure after the events unfold.<p>In the case of houses, you only lose if the resale value of the property falls below the outstanding amount of the loan, presuming interest + taxes + maintenance do not exceed the equivalent amount of rent.  Because loans are fixed at a currency amount on the date of funding, a property that keeps pace with inflation wins.<p>There are also intangible aspects to ownership, including security of tenure and ability to modify the dwelling as needs arise.  It's impossible to put a price on this, but you could imagine one by asking a tenant how much insurance would they pay per year to prevent being evicted.<p>The key to property in general is the land underneath the property.  A dwelling is itself a depreciating asset, which wears out, becomes unfashionable and falls in value.  The land underneath the dwelling is the bit that increases in value, or at the very least maintains it's value compared to a currency being systematically inflated by a central bank.<p>For many people, a modest mortgage and their own property is a sensible investment, provided that they do not trade houses excessively, dip into the equity or destroy the value of their house.<p>So, again, leverage is a strategy used everwhere with many things.  Excessive leverage is high risk, but sensible, well managed leverage is the key to success in life.",1355208892

As demand for purchasing housing goes up, demand for renting typically goes down (ie. either levels off or regresses).  Sure over time both go up, but at a particular slice of time, usually on a cost of living basis one is advantageous over the other.  And while you're renting at a cheaper cost than it would be to essentially rent money (let's not kid ourselves, you don't <i>own</i> a house if you have a mortgage), you have liquidity to place in other investment vehicles.<p>Small observation... maybe there's something to it, maybe not, but it seems I'm 2/2 on calling when market swings happen here in downtown San Diego over the past 10 years.  Take a look at the delta in rental prices in properties in various classes and compare verses actual selling prices.  Just like a P/E for a company, if you can't at least turn a profit on owning a piece of property as a rental, it is likely overpriced.  As much as people love to talk about various market factors much of this is emotionally driven.<p>For instance, last year I observed an entry level condo complex in a marginal area rent 1 beds in the $1800-1900 range.  The latest comps for that building were $150k for like properties.  About 5 blocks away 1 beds in a luxury high-rise were renting in the $2200-2300 area.  Comps?  High $300k.  At the height of the market comps for the luxury high-rise were in the mid $500k area and the marginal property were in the upper $300k area.  Back when that was happening, the luxury high-rise unit was renting just shy of $2k.  The marginal unit?  About $1400.  I took another 4-5 other buildings in the area of varying quality and this trend was intact.  To be fair this is a small, insular market and these swings are largely driven by speculation from the bubble-tastic situation many overheated markets found themselves in (ie. people owning and flipping multiple properties found the bottom of the market being rented cheaply).",1355207978

4903378,comment,4902960,4903139,37,0,drewcrawford,,,"I think the problem is in how the question is framed.  The App Store has always been revenue neutral [1].  It's not a profit center for Apple.  It's not about ""getting their cut"".  It's about having one billing statement to look at.  It's about eliminating shady billing tactics a la gym memberships.  It's about keeping your address out of some developer's mailing list.<p>You'd be surprised about the extent of this problem.  I get e-mails all the time from people who are worried that they have a monthly payment for my app, for example.  There are just an awful lot of people who don't ""get"" software at all and derive real value from simplified one-party billing.<p>So if you start from the premise that billing for iOS apps has to be brain-dead simple, we arrive at the present rule: any payment that looks like it happens on an iPhone must [2] run through IAP at whatever rate Apple can break even.  If your payment collection process consists of people using their fingers on the screen of an iPhone, then it is potentially confusable with IAP by Grandpa and he might get mad at Apple; this is unacceptable.  But monetizing your pizza ordering app by handing money to a pizza delivery guy who shows up at your house is not confusable, so it's A-OK.<p>Now, it's perfectly debatable whether or not consumer confusion is really that big of a problem, or a problem big enough to justify the negative externalities of solving it.  But if it is, then the result follows: the solution is to run all the billing through a break-even single party.  If you accept the premise, then the rule that is fairest and best and also solves the problem is the rule that we already have.<p>It's unfortunate that we live in a world where the economics of Dropbox, Skydrive, Amazon et al seemingly don't allow enough profit margin to pay Apple's overhead to process payments.  But I'm not really sure who is to blame for that: the consumers, for being confused about billing; Apple, for trying to fix it for them; Skydrive etc. for not creating a two-tiered pricing structure to charge IAP customers at 30% more; or consumers again for being unwilling to pay an extra 30% for single-party billing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/apple_app_store_runs_just_above_break_even"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/apple_app_store_runs_...</a>

It is very important for athletes to do this kind of visualization work, in a form appropriate to their discipline, but often when we are caught up in the intense routine of training and competition, it feels like we have no time for the internal stuff. I know this quite well. Sometimes when I am in the heat of tournament preparation, months will pass with brutal sparring, constant pain, hitting the mats hundreds of times a night while drilling throws, and then Ill realize that Ive moved a bit away from what really makes things tick. Then Ill spend a week doing soft, quiet work on timing, perception, reading and controlling my opponents breath patterns and internal blinks, subtle unbalancing touches that set up the dramatic throws that ultimately steal the spotlight. After these periods of reflection, Ill almost invariably have a leap in ability because my new physical skills are supercharged by becoming integrated into my mental framework.
The importance of undulating between external and internal (or concrete and abstract; technical and intuitive) training applies to all disciplines, and unfortunately the internal tends to be neglected. Most intelligent NFL players, for example, use the off-season to look at their schemes more abstractly, study tapes, break down aerial views of the field, notice offensive and defensive patterns. Then, during the season they sometimes fall into tunnel vision, because the routine of constant pain requires every last bit of reserves. I have heard quite a few NFL quarterbacks who had minor injuries and were forced to sit out a game or two, speak of the injury as a valuable opportunity to concentrate on the mental side of their games. When they return, they play at a higher level. In all athletic disciplines, it is the internal work that makes the physical mat time click, but it is easy to lose touch with this reality in the middle of the grind.<p>""""""""""<p>The idea suggested above is very intriguing, but begs the question what are the internal and external training components when applied to a software programmer/engineer?",1355207215

In reality, very few actually focused on ameteur material, and most just had full videos or clips from paysites.<p>The ones with full videos were considered to be 'illegal' tubes but the adult market doesn't have an organization with the clout or lawyers equivalent of the RIAA so most of the content stayed up.<p>The tube sites made their money through advertising and through CPA affiliate programs for paysite networks. Paysites had a love-hate relationship with the tubes. On the one hand, they got traffic conversions. On the other hand, the tubes would use content without authorization which hurt the conversion ratios, and made the paysite content as a whole less valuable to surfers in the know.<p>Manwin was originally a paysite network, but unlike their competition they embraced the idea of tubes. They launched paid-content websites (under the Brazzers brand) while founding their own tube network (KeezMovies, PornHub).<p>That vertical integration gave them higher margins than the compeition---they owned both the traffic generators and the eventual paysites needed for conversions. As they became more successful, they went on a buying spree and through various mergers and name changes emerged with over 10 paysite networks under their brand as either wholly owned entities or content partners (e..g Playboy), and 8 of top ten tube sites.<p>As for margins....<p>I believe there was a margins slump from 2007 onwards due to the slump in the advertising market as a whole.

4903276,comment,4902984,4903101,4,0,true_religion,,,"> user-submitted-content based porn website<p>If you think about it, there's no real difference between the code base for a user submitted porn-site and a user submiitted site for videos and pictures. The only change is the template used on the frontend, and the nature of what you allow to be uploaded.<p>So a user-submitted content site can be created with a turn-key script that can be had for less than $1000.<p>Now, in my experience with ad-based content.... advertising rates vary by a pretty sharp degree from month to month if you go through a 3rd party agency. You can make 6 months at X rate, then see a sudden unexpected 30% decline on the same traffic. Couple that with the fact that adult-based ads pay less. For example, Facebook makes $1.00 Desktop CPC, but adult ads regularly sell for $0.01 CPC---1% of mainstream!<p>Because of that, I can see why sites will have 8 or 10 ads per page in order to get enough margin to cover unexpected rate losses.<p>I do think you are 100% right about one thing. Smart conversion optimization would be a huge boon in the adult market. Currently, none of the major CPA firms take adult content so its a green-field market. The schelp factor is that you'd have to work with 100s of independent accounts, all with minimum payout floors, but its doable with the right team and lots of traffic.",1355206001

Since you mentioned LotR universe:<p>""New Line made enough pre-sales in foreign markets, and there were enough subsidies to pretty much cover their costs. New Zealand was not the only subsidy. There was also the British Commonwealth subsidy and the German tax subsidy in those days. New Line didn't have to put up any cash to make that movie.""<p>Also movie studios consistently claim to not make profits from their movies.<p>""However, New Line later produced accounts showing that instead of making a profit, the movies made ""horrendous losses"". According to Hubbard: ""We found it surprising because it was one of the biggest box office success of all time.""""<p>Other funding options: a company could start making short films and then transition into making larger, more expensive ones once it gains the trust of its audience.  The films could be broken into ""episodes"" to reduce the amount of money that each chunk would cost.  This all ignores patronage, another alternative funding mode.<p>Lastly, most movies aren't blockbusters.  Even if everything I just said is a lie, the vast majority of movies will be just fine, because their budgets are laughably small.  District 9 was shot for 30 million dollars.  Primer was shot for 7000 dollars.  When Harry Met Sally cost 16 million dollars.  Citizen Kane cost 15 million.  Pretty Woman cost 14 million.

The short version is that if you give people free will, then there is a risk that they will try to hurt each other; if you always intervene to ensure that they <i>can't</i> hurt each other, then their free will is worthless; and if they don't have free will, then what's the point of them living?<p>Now as I said, that's the short version, and in such drastically abbreviated form the argument has holes you could drive a humvee through. An alternate explanation is that the creators of the simulation simply don't care about us at all, and we and our problems have nothing to do with its purpose. One might also ask, if the creators do care about us after all, why didn't they just make everyone morally perfect so they <i>wouldn't</i> freely hurt each other? In which case me-with-my-theologian-hat would say ""maybe a life of pain is the very process by which morally perfect people are created"". But theodicy is a very large field which I cannot adequately summarize in this post, so if you want real answers, just start with that book.",1355205888

4903264,comment,4902963,4903154,27,0,gfodor,,,"This is an excellent point which deflates most of this article's premise. The ""shelter short"" you hold by being a living breathing person is really just what can be considered livable shelter. For most people, I'd imagine they live in houses that are well beyond what they could reasonably survive in, so that portion of the equity position of the house they live in is strictly ""long"".<p>This probably is better served by an example. Lets say you buy a $2m home as a single person. And lets also say you could just as comfortably live in a $250k home. If house prices go up and your $2m home suddenly becomes a $2.25m home, you can sell it and get a ""free"" livable home with the 250k profit. (Technically that house would be selling for 277k at that point so you get to buy a ""livable home"" for $27k, but that's besides the point.) You basically are now market neutral, whereas before you were long. You will have a livable home for the rest of your life, as long as your requirements of what is considered livable do not change.<p>Where does the ""free livable home"" come from? $1.75M of your original home was ""long houses"". Or, another way to look at it is you were leveraging beyond your $250k ""survivalship position"" in housing by 8x, and then scaled back the leverage to 1x when you bought your second home. This $1.75M was speculation (or investment, depending on how you look at it :)) in the housing market. The additional speculative risk you took via the leverage resulted in the market rewarding you with a place to live.",1355205765

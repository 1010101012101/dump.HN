It should be easy to match the load profile and come up with a ""Surgeon-compatible"" ammunition, should the tech ever catch on to that degree.",1364846361

Gyms do not work for 89% of Americans, but yet they are a $21B industry thanks to recurring fees. We are trying to change that by bringing the Gym to your home over live video and thus eliminating waste. If the country gets a little more fitter using our platform, thats all the more good.<p>We want you to come help us engineer this transition. We are doing what AirBnb, Uber and others did with excess capacity in their markets to fitness professional market.<p>Our customers love us. Every 2 out of 3 users who works out with one of our trainers comes back for more. We just recently launched Group workouts. We just graduated from Rock Health and have some great investors who get marketplaces like us. We make money when users pay to workout with a trainer. And our prices are a fraction of the gym costs thanks to efficiencies we provide.<p>We use our own platform to keep ourselves healthy. No one has yet got a six-pack but we could probably all run long distances comfortably. We are a small team, so your impact and influence on our culture will be huge. Almost all of us have worked at other companies before so while we dont have nerf guns, we still know how to have fun.<p>Our technical stack is Python/Django and MySQL. We also use Fabric, NGinx, Apache, Celery, Redis and RabbitMQ. We also use services like CircleCI, Optimizely, MixPanel, SegmentIO and Asana for getting things done.<p>Contact us at dev@wello.co.",1364846305

This concentrates wealth in the hands of private banks as the populace is forced into debt simply to own a home and educate their children, hoping that the loans can be repaid by others going into debt in greater amounts later to purchase the assets they themselves have purchased through incurring large amounts of personal debt. However, debt expansion leads to price appreciation of assets through speculation as the financial market becomes riskier and this process is unsustainable in the long run, with the last cycle of indebted being wiped out when they cannot find anyone to buy the assets they themselves have purchased by going into massive debt.</i><p><a href=""http://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Criticism_of_fractional_reserve_banking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Criticism_of_fractional_reserve_b...</a>",1364846191

Saudi Arabia can pump oil for less than $5/barrel, but what drives the prices are the costs of fracked shale and frontier plays like UDW.  Gold is the same.  Generally, gold is found in sulfide mineralization deposits or in placer deposits (weathered ore bodies, ie nuggets in alluvial deposits).  Most new mines are the former, which requires massive mining and ore treatment (on the order of grams of gold per ton of ore, which is then crushed and leached in acids).  So it's expensive to produce.  Usually it's found with silver and copper, and some miners will account for it after credits for selling those metals, but you can assume $800-1000 USD/oz for production costs after fully capitalizing the development of the mines, at least the last time I looked into it several years ago.",1364845825

Macarthur BART has lots of trains to the city and assuming you're going somewhere near a station (like Twitter or Google SF) it's ~ 20 minutes.  Strong hipster vibe, and an explosion of restaurants, bike shops, funky secondhand stores, etc. in the last 10 years.  Neighborhood is still rough in patches, but rapidly improving.  Stay to the North and East of Macarthur BART and you're fine.<p>Downtown Berkeley.  Safe Neighborhood.  Lots of young people about, plenty of restaurants.  Things tend to close up earlier than in the city.  Commute is slightly longer than to Temescal, but the Richmond trains tend to be emptier and so you almost always get a seat.<p>If you work at Google SF or anywhere downtown, look into the AC Transit Transbay Buses.  They are slightly more expensive than BART ($4.20 a ride, last I checked) but you get free Wifi, great views, clean, comfortable coach seats, and nonstop service.  That opens up a LOT more territory, albeit mostly away from the concentrations of culture.<p>But all that said, you're right, SF is the place to be if you can afford it. Don't try to save money as an intern.  What you earn during that time is a drop in the bucket, ultimately, and you're only young once.

I simply play the first result that youtube returns.<p>I had thought of a similar idea to what this website does (using song metadata from a cleaned source like Spotify and then play the song through YouTube).<p>The way I'd imagined doing the song to YouTube mapping was through crowdsourcing - you could rank the YouTube results for each song based on number of listens and votes on your website.  By default you would play the top ranked video for a song, but allow users to see alternate video links (probably hidden behind menus) and play those instead if they want (or if they have accounts, you could allow users to individually mark a video as being their preference for a particular song, etc.), probably also incorporating these plays into your ranking.  You could also use crowdsourcing for further metadata about the video - e.g., some music videos have long intros/outros that you wouldn't necessarily want to hear when you're just listening to music, so you could allow people to submit and vote on start/end times for the 'song' part of the music video.<p>Anyway, I really like the interface!

Because of parametricity, the behavior of the function doesn't depend on what the values actually are. The shortness of the names really <i>is</i> meant to convey ""don't think about what this is doing, because it's not important for this function"". In the traditional example for map,<p><pre><code>  map f [] = []\n  map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs\n</code></pre>\nYou're supposed to infer from the short function names that f and x could be <i>anything</i>. The only important bit is that you can apply one argument to f (so, for example, f could take two parameters, and then map is just doing a single partial application). In that context, x and xs is actually a <i>better</i> convention than ""first"" and ""rest"", because they indicate the adherence to the type system. The naming here is saying that x is of the type of elements of xs, and that this is the only important information for map.

Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use.

On top of our robotic workcells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI.

And that's a pretty important distinction to make.<p>Many things can cause distractibility, from sleep deprivation to thyroid disorders.  ADD/ADHD is only one of them.  The effective treatment for any of these will not help the others.  That is why the DSM-IV includes as a diagnostic criteria that you have to screen for other possible causes of the behavioral issues and rule them out.<p>The ""many doctors"" that you describe are simply not doing their job properly.  By comparison the screening process for my son's diagnosis took about a month.  Possibly not coincidentally I live in California - a state that has one of the lowest rates of diagnosis of ADD and ADHD.  (Look at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/prevalence.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/prevalence.html</a> to see your state diagnosis rate - I'd be suspicious of any diagnosis made in Alabama.)  I am confident that my son's diagnosis is correct - my son has responded well to medication, while children without the disorder don't.<p>So here is my point again.  If you're noticeably distractible and possibly sleep deprived, try getting more sleep.  It might make a big difference.  If you've actually got ADHD or ADD it won't hurt you, but it won't fix the problem either.  There are other things that can also produce the same symptoms.  Go to a competent doctor if you've got reason to be concerned.",1364843128

Not sure. Sometimes maybe.<p>The U.S. is the most technologically productive society in the history of the world, and we have had patents since our founding. Much of the valuable technology around us was funded either by: 1) patent monopolies; 2) natural or government-sanctioned monopolies; 3) government research funding. Much of what wasn't was funded by other mechanisms for reducing competition (for example, Intel's trade secrets to keep its manufacturing edge).<p>Ultimately, there is no money in highly competitive markets. Competition drives prices towards the marginal costs of production, which not only saps R&D budgets in capital-intensive fields, but without IP protection reduces any incentive to engage in capital-intensive R&D when the results can be easily copied by competitors.<p>Look at one company we consider innovative today: Google. Google benefits from several features of its industry that tend to undermine perfect competition: network effects, a government granted monopoly (over the trademark Google--imagine if Samsung could redirect ""Google Searches"" to their own search engine), a privately-granted monopoly (domain names), government-monopolies over their copyrighted-software, etc. And of course, the half-trillion dollar advertising industry from which it derives nearly all its revenue would collapse if trademark monopolies didn't prevent companies from free-riding on advertising investments. As a result, Google makes a ton of money, and can use it to do cool things like research Google Glass and self-driving cars that don't immediately turn a profit. If Google was trying to eke out an existence in a perfectly-competitive market based purely on the quality of its search results, none of this would happen.",1364842996

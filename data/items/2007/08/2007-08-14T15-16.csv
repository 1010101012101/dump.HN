Even if you are a first mover, you will still have indirect competitors, and customers used to paying a certain price and buying at a certain frequency.  Talk to your customers, find out how they are consuming, and position your product accordingly.<p>Really Basic Example: A skype based cell phone should be priced similarly to comparable phones, with a premium because skype is cheaper than other cell phone plans.<p>For web products, one trick I learned is to use Google Adwords with different prices and features listed, and observe CTR.

Sometimes raising the price increases market share ie... wine. For a web service there are no cost of goods or product costs to use as a basis and then add 100% margin.
Unless you are going to turn off all your potential customers at once, which is unlikely, just do it and iterate.seems like it would be easier to lower price than raise it.",1187106886
42251,comment,42238,42238,0,0,boris,,,"You are approaching this problem from a wrong side. First you need to determine how much your service is worth to the customers, in monetary terms. Then you can base your price on that. Normally you would divide your service benefits into two parts: ""commodity"" and  ""unique"". You would charge what it costs  you to provide it for the commodity part and how much it is worth to the customer for the ""unique"" part.<p>Also note that educating the customer about the value (in monetary terms) that they will receive by using your service is the key to make this strategy work.",1187106825

42249,comment,42239,42239,0,0,nickb,,,"I think I saw two episodes of UK's Dragon's Den from the first season (you can find them on bittorrent sites). It was an interesting show from what I remember. For those that never heard of it, here's what wikipedia says:<p>""Dragons' Den is a television programme that originated in Japan where the format is owned by Sony. The format, which now airs internationally, consists of entrepreneurs pitching their ideas to secure investment finance from business experts -- the ""Dragons"".""<p>Basically, you pitch a bunch of rich people, entrepreneurs and investors and they tell you what you think and they might invest into your idea as well.",1187105653

42247,comment,42246,42246,0,0,ratsbane,,,"I've consulted with two medical practices on implementing EMR systems in the last few years.  The systems that are now available (at least the ones I've looked at) are rather old-technology - not web-based, don't allow for patients to access their records themselves, etc.  This new Google service, if it works as well as it might, could really radically change all of this - particularly if practitioners can use it.  The next thing, then, is to tie it into the billing systems used by practitioners, etc... opportunity?",1187105300

42244,comment,42067,42067,0,0,martin,,,"Another consideration is the availability of software. There aren't <i>that</i> many things the average home user does on the computer -- word processing, web browsing, music, digital photography -- and all of those needs are served quite well on the Mac platform right now. <p>In the enterprise, sure, everybody does word processing, web browsing, etc., but beyond that, all bets are off. When I worked in a banking environment, I supported dozens of business-critical Windows apps, from third-party market data software to nasty, internally-hacked-together VB apps. Abandoning those apps wasn't even close to being an option. Even all the web apps in that environment worked only in IE on Windows. Any other enterprise of significant size is almost guaranteed to have dozens of critical apps of its own. I suppose if you <i>really</i> wanted to get a Mac into such an environment, you could access the Windows apps over Citrix or something, but that'd be a pain.<p>Even if app support wasn't an issue, most enterprises are already quite tied into the Microsoft stack -- Active Directory, Exchange, SharePoint -- which makes supporting Macs even as a secondary platform challenging at best.<p>And even if you consider that surmountable, it's still no wonder that Apple is more interested in home users -- they are (if you'll pardon the expression) the low-hanging fruit.",1187104846

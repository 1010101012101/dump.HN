In NY I have Time Warner Cable 50Mbps but it's basically capped at 250GB and I think I pay $80/month for it.<p>But there are three important advantages Australia has in this regard:<p>1. The caps are known and advertised. In the US they are far more surreptitious;<p>2. You get what you pay for. If you pay for 200GB, you get 200GB. There is no hiding behind ""fair use"" or nebulous definitions of ""unlimited"". This also means that a low traffic user can pay as little as $30/month for their ADSL2+ connection. Nor do you get labelled a bandwidth hogged and get transferred to some incredibly oversubscribed network if you dare to download (common practice in the UK); and<p>3. If you wish, you can pay for and get 1TB+/month. Where I am, my only choices are TWC and crappy ADSL1 providers. If I wanted >250GB/month I couldn't get it.<p>And all this is the current system. Australia is in the early stages of rolling out FTTH (fibre to the home) for ~95% of the population with structural separation between providing wholesale and retail services.<p>So I wouldn't be too quick to crow about Internet advantages in the US over Australia (or anywhere really).",1305395768

2548165,comment,2544500,2544500,1,0,pnathan,,,"This is something I've thought about in the last year or two as well. We have a culture of ""buy"", not ""fix"". In part, this is because we've had a very rich 60 years. In part, this is because things are cheap. In part, because factories design things that are not designed for repair by customers.<p>The reality is, we can't fix a busted capacitor, a scratched CD, or a damaged microchip.  Nor do we have the equipment and spare materials ready to hand to weld cracked plastic. Super Glue is it, and not a very good it.<p>Whereas, we can fix wood, and with some work, manage metal. Earth can be munged around.<p>Cars are designed to be maintained, unlike computer hardware (especially our Macs :-( ).<p>So in a culture where by the nature of the things we use, we can not trivially repair them - we leave off the ideas of repair, and prefer the idea of replace.<p>This is a problem, because we are more than consumers, more than robots being pipe-fed from the wells of other people's industry.<p>H.G. Wells' conception of the time traveller always hangs around in my head when this sort of discussion arises.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine</a>",1305395563

2548160,comment,2547772,2548077,7,0,gnosis,,,"<i>""This is a critique of a therapy repeatedly proven empirically superior in it's efficacy to other non-pharmacological approaches.""</i><p>Well, that's the question isn't it?  Has it really been proven to be superior, or is it just scientistic, reductionist hype that is championed by insurers, governments, and societies that values cheap, quick, superficial bandaids instead of potentially more expensive approaches that might actually require a long, hard look at the depths of your own self.<p><i>""I say this as a huge advocate, and student of, Jung, Freud, Adler and the rest.""</i><p>I really wonder about that, considering your later mischaracterization of Jungian therapy.<p><i>""But come on, if something helps people who can't leave the house, hold a job, or drive a car function again, without 10 years of 5 session a week therapy, how can you ethically justify attacking it this way.""</i><p>But does it help them?  That is the key question.  You clearly seem to think so.  Not everyone agrees.<p><i>""CBT attempts to change negative thoughts and maladaptive behavior by addressing thoughts and behavior.  Jungian therapy attempts to help people integrate elements of their psyche carried over from previous lives, an inherited collective psyche (yes Jung was a Nazi).""</i><p>First, it's not like Jungian psychology does not ""address thoughts and behavior"".  It does.  It just has a different understanding of what the causes of these thoughts and behaviors are, what they mean, and how and when to change them.<p>Second, to say that <i>""Jungian therapy attempts to help people integrate elements of their psyche carried over from previous lives""</i> makes it sound like Jungian therapy is based on a belief in reincarnation.  This is false.<p><i>""an inherited collective psyche""</i><p>This is more accurate.  Humans inherit certain instincts, such as the sucking instinct a baby exhibits when presented with a nipple.  Human brain structure is partially an inherited characteristic.  Jungians argue that there are psychological instincts that are also inherited.<p>For instance, an image of a breast might trigger certain feelings and behavior in an infant.  The image of an infant might trigger certain feelings and behavior in a mother.<p>The actual theory of such ""archetypes"" the ""collective unconscious"" is actually much more complex.  Entire books, in fact many, many books have been written on these subjects.  So the above should not be taken as even an adequate summary, much less an exhaustive account of what they're about.<p><i>""Jung was a Nazi""</i><p>This is troubling and problematic, but not really relevant to the question of whether Jungian therapy works.  It's even less relevant to the question of whether CBT works.",1305395502

Because one particular compiler is horrible on error presentation doesn't mean that the language is bad.<p>> <i>declared somewhere with static linkage, it can be hard to pin down exactly _when_ that constructor will be called.</i><p>The language doesn't define it on purpose. The language leaves it to be defined by the implementation because it goes a little beyond the purpose of the compiler. The compiler transforms C++ source into object code. You can have multiple objects linked together into a single binary, and this linkage is very platform and operating-system dependent. C++ is already horribly difficult to implement correctly; if the language were to define an order for static initialization, it would be stepping on the operating system domain, and make it even more difficult to implement on some systems.",1305395132

I used the word ""simplistic"" which bears some negative flavor (pointlessly simple?). Lisp is relatively simple and yet powerful, i.e. it is not simplistic. C++ is incredibly complex (dare to write a full blown modern C++ compiler?) and powerful. Not surprisingly though, the simplicity of Lisp doesn't make it easier to grasp.<p>From this point of view, languages that are neither complex nor allow for complexity can be called ""simplistic"". They are easy to learn, easy to write code in, and as easy to grow to unmaintainable sizes because of their verbosity.

Dollars (and thus value) would flood into the Bitcoin system with something like that.<p>But where's the incentive for the producer?

Frankly, there is simply no way of knowing the future (though I agree, there's no way of ensuring security of samples into the future, either). We worry about destruction of rainforests, because we have no idea what cures and solutions we might find in the undiscovered life within that could be lost forever. Likewise, we simply don't know what today's ""horror of horrors"" could find beneficial use, some day.<p>In the event that we are invaded by aliens, I would count the success of unleashing small pox on them as being much greater than Jeff Goldblum infecting them with a virus from his macbook. :P<p>When it comes down to it, though, I don't think there's a right answer. We just have to make an educated judgement call. Maybe the kind of judgement call where we respond to things like ""but if we torture people, we can find terrorists!"" with ""but that's not the kind of people we are"". Maybe we really do need to be the kind of people who say we're not willing to risk exposing innocent people to this for some future that we are only guessing about. Or maybe it's enough to simply map the genome and keep the data on it archived, while dumping the actual real deal.",1305393037

Are we an engineering discipline or what?""<p>You know what. It's a funny thing, but as I was typing my response to your original post, I actually said this exact same thing to myself, and I started to think. It would be incredible if there was some non-emotional, non-touchy-feely way to get at the value of one language vs another. But then programming language choice just seems to be an inherently ""feel"" based decision...<p>""We should clean up the table from the psychological aspects of the matter and look at what's left: that's how powerful and how clever a language can be in the hands of a good developer.""<p>This is one of the things that I thought of, but then there are so many demonstrations of people using all kinds of programming languages to do things that are incredibly clever and powerful.<p>Sometimes I like to just go through open source projects written in programming languages I am not extremely familiar with. I just want to get a taste of some of the myriad of programming styles and techniques that are out there. The different ways of looking at the same problem.<p>Even if I disagree with the method used, it is always eye-opening to see other ways of doing things - even some that may be vastly different from anything that I have ever seen before (my first time looking at Haskell comes to mind). I like to understand how and why different developers choose the routes that they choose.<p>I don't know, but to me it seems that, in a way, it is good that there is no emotionless method for rating languages. To declare one language as being definitively better than all others seems to me that it would be a tremendous loss. There is some value, I think, in having a diversity of ""good"" languages just for its own sake.<p>As to the simplicity of a language, well, to some people simplicity in a programming language is a beautiful thing, but then, the problem is that what constitutes simple is also a thing that varies from developer to developer. Perhaps the diversity of languages is a natural development from the diversity of programmers?<p>I think about Ruby. You know, when Matz describes why he created the language, he says that he wanted to create something that felt fun to develop in - fun for him. The fact that other people just happened to like Ruby was an unintended side effect.<p>I think that most people create a programming language with a similar type of outlook. They, either purposefully or subconsciously, try to build it to achieve a certain ""feel"". Perhaps it is this ""feel"" that makes a good developer powerful and clever with a language.<p>""for reasons I don't understand very well, a simple \"Hello world\" application written for JVM can take seconds to load and execute.""<p>Heh heh, I have no comments on that.",1305392647

For that, I don't have to own a car or the maintenance and depreciation associated with it. I still pay transit, but it is significantly less than the cost I paid in Ohio to drive 40-60 miles to work.<p>My income mirrors my actual worth.

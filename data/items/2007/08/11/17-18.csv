One of the points of the former is that a lot of the big successes are just luck - being in the right place at the right time and having enough skills to capitalize on the opportunity.  But beyond that, there is often nothing in particular that can be copied to 'achieve success'.  It's an interesting book, and I'm still wrestling with it.",1186852873

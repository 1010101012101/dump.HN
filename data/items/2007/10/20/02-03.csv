70615,comment,70453,70453,0,0,ardit33,,,"Good god.  People, you sound like teeangers,  or worse, like those girls that are hot in their town, are all ""that"", and think they can be actresses so they move to LA.  They quickly find out they are thousands of other hot girls, and they are just merely average.  They try to find acting jobs to make it ""big"", but eventually will be forced to wait tables, or work at starbucks.<p>SO, to all you guys that are deciding to move to SV:<p>1. What stops your ""idea"" from being successful where you are currently at?  Can't you get your business/idea off the ground to a certain point, where you CAN actually get some kind of funding, and maybe have move with VC money, and not your credit card.<p>\n2. Do you really think that just by the fact that you come here, you will find everything paved in gold?  And everything is going to resolve itself somewhow, and you going to meet that VC/angel and give you money?<p>\n3. Are you actually preparing to move to the SF Bay area well enough?  Do you guys realise that rents and living expenses are thru the roof in here  (NYC/Manhatan is the only place more expensive).   Do you guys know how HARD (like in months) is to find a decent appartment.   Make sure you get some temporary housing BEFORE coming here, or you will get screweded big time by thinking you can stay in ah hotel, and find a place in a week or so.<p>People, I don't want to rein your parada, but be realistic.  If you have a very good idea/prototype/initial users, tell VCs. that you have the willingess to move to SV, and maybe move here when you get some funding.<p>Otherwise, you can come to SF (visiting) go to those tech parties, demos, to connect with potential investors.  You don't need to move to SV to do that.\n",1192848947

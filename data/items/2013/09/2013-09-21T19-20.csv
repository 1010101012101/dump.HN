I guess this didn&#x27;t cause a problem on the 64 bit machine he was using,  but it caused the code to blow up on 32 bit machines. I removed the array and it worked OK.<p>I was lucky to be programming in Java while it was still in beta when I was working on my PhD.

There can be concerns about the ability to actually write code, the ability to be practical, to be OK with working with unclean data, the ability to get stuff out the door and have a hacker mentality, etc etc.<p>However, these concerns tend to arise BEFORE starting the interview process.

But in this case, it isn&#x27;t really the PhD itself under discussion, it&#x27;s the preparation and skills acquired through a course of a PhD.

6424215,comment,6423846,6423846,3,0,RogerL,,,"I don&#x27;t know the author, so I cannot say how his interviews went. In general I think you have to take control of the interviews and just show the person why you are valuable. It&#x27;s hard to find talent; the person interviewing <i>wants</i> to like you, if for no other reason than she can get back to coding.<p>The PhDs that I&#x27;ve interviewed have applied for very senior positions, yet not brought all of the skills needed. Which is more than jusr abstract thought. You need to turn out code that is maintainable and readable by the team. You need to ruthlessly reduce the problem and algorithms to a level that allows you to launch before you run out of money. Far more than being a thinker or researcher, you need to be an engineer. You need to be very, very productive. And so on. I&#x27;m not sure what the answer is, but there is a pretty big gulf. You look at the projects and okay, it&#x27;s somewhat interesting, but impractical. You ask them how they&#x27;d solve a problem that you are trying to hire them to solve, and you get &quot;I&#x27;d conduct a study...&quot; when we have 6 months to market and your study would take a year, and probably not provide definitive results. It&#x27;s just a different mind set. I can&#x27;t afford to bring you into a senior role and wait while you learn to be an engineer, while you learn to code at a higher level than &#x27;University code&#x27; (a disparaging quote about the quality of the code Sergy and Larry brought to Google) and so on. We have a real, hard problem, and need an extremely focused, skilled, multidimensional person to perform it. I&#x27;ve yet to come across a PhD that made me think they could do it.<p>&quot;I can learn to do that&quot;. Well, sure. Anybody can, it&#x27;s just that so few do. Only a small handful of people actually produce at a high level in the ways I&#x27;m talking about. I don&#x27;t want to bet on you being one of the few.",1379793243

6424213,comment,6422034,6423970,3,0,lambda,,,"If you take a look at the Lenski paper[1], it says:<p>> The potentiating mutations are not known to confer any phenotype amenable to screening, so there is no simple way to distinguish between potentiated and non-potentiated clones.<p>Now, that isn&#x27;t conclusive evidence that there was no benefit on its own, but it doesn&#x27;t sound like there&#x27;s any evidence that it did provide some kind of greater fitness. It sounds like all evidence shows that the original mutation didn&#x27;t provide any particular phenotypic change on its own, it was only after the later mutation that it had any measurable effect.<p>Now, with dinosaurs it&#x27;s much harder to tell. We obviously can&#x27;t do any kind of controlled experiments, or observe them directly. But we can offer up a few potential explanations. One is that some mutations can occur without either helping or harming, but later on another mutation can lead to something useful.<p>Or there may be benefits conferred by proto-feathers. Remember, in addition to their similarity to down, proto-feathers are somewhat similar to hair, and may provide many of the benefits that hair provides: warmth, colors which allow either catching the attention of mates or blending in to the background, better sense of touch (you can feel something before your skin brushes against it), better sensation of the wind, and protection from things that may scrape or cut you.<p>According to Wikipedia[2], the insulation and display (colorful feathers for attracting mates) hypotheses seem to be the more probable. Obviously, we&#x27;re not going to solve this by speculating here on HN, and it may be that the reason can never be conclusively determined because you can&#x27;t go back in time to run controlled experiments, but based on the evidence we have those theories sound reasonably plausible.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3461117/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3461117/</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feathered_dinosaur#Primitive_feather_types"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feathered_dinosaur#Primitive_f...</a>",1379793208

However, the risk you run there is that this could introduce bugs - Firefox and Chrome both regularly run into bugs caused by the optimizer or linker, and in some cases the fix is to stop the optimizer/linker from fiddling with that code.",1379793124

6424188,comment,6423846,6423846,9,0,georgemcbay,,,"In my experience (as someone who dropped out of undergrad to enter the industry, fwiw) there is a pretty widely held bias against people with PhDs in quite a lot of the software development industry.   Almost like having spent the time to earn a PhD is like a way worse version of coming to a (non-financial sector) software development job interview in a three piece suit with a tie... you&#x27;re just instantly distrusted by a lot of folks.  I&#x27;m sure it varies from company to company, but I&#x27;ve seen this behavior repeatedly over many years.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with it, for what it&#x27;s worth.  I do understand the rough justification that academic work is very different than real-world coding, but even if you accept that reasoning 100% then at the very worst a PhD should be seen as a neutral to slightly positive indicator (at least they see things through) if the person is otherwise a fantastic fit, not a negative. However, in my experience this negative bias towards PhDs in the greater software development sphere is a real phenomenon.",1379792735

6424185,comment,6423846,6423846,8,0,yetanotherphd,,,"As someone who searched for jobs as a de facto CS PhD, I can relate to what the author is saying.  PhD&#x27;s tend to slot into very specific niches, and if you don&#x27;t fill that niche they won&#x27;t want you, even if your skills are a superset of the skills they need.  I was rejected for certain jobs because my research wasn&#x27;t closely related enough.  People whose research was squarely in that area had no problem getting these jobs.  In the end, my job ended up being something I didn&#x27;t realize I was qualified for, but with hindsight I fitted the niche perfectly.<p>Part of the problem is simply that the market is &quot;thin&quot;.  There are less jobs, and less PhD&#x27;s than there are people with Masters or Bachelors in CS.  So the matching process takes longer.  People won&#x27;t want to hire you for a job you are overqualified for, and in the long run this would be bad for both parties.<p>As to the people who think that professors are just over-confident so they can keep churning out PhD&#x27;s, I think this is wrong for two reasons.  First, the situation is subtle, and hard to understand for someone who isn&#x27;t actually going through it.  Second, the market is not bad, it&#x27;s just very peculiar: as you can see, the author did get a good job in the end, it just took a lot of time.",1379792688

By then, the page had in the neighborhood of 145k page views and the worst was over. I thought it was cool as hell but the girlfriend, meh, not so much. I had already arrived home later than expected, making us late for dinner w/ friends, and she certainly did not share in my enthusiasm, to say the least.<p>When it was finally over, that page had received just north of 180k page views and made me a few hundred bucks thanks to the AdSense banner across the top of the page.

In the first few classes, I remember being awed by the wealth and legacy of the man, and wanting to glean everything I could from him. It quickly became apparent though that he hadn&#x27;t updated his course materials or lectures in over a decade, e.g. the pros and cons of distributed shared memory vs COBOL RPC. The core topics were there, it was just presented in such a dry manner.<p>Worse though, was that he would needlessly inject his very conservative politics as total non-sequiturs. Test questions like &quot;Hillary Clinton wants to build [obviously unscalable system], explain why it won&#x27;t work. I found it very unprofessional.<p>Stanford records a video of every lecture, and enrolled students can then watch them whenever.

When capitalism really works this way, it does a good job; but its defenders are wrong in assuming it always works this way. If the runners forget why the reward is offered and become intent on winning, no matter how, they may find other strategies--such as, attacking other runners. If the runners get into a fist fight, they will all finish late.&quot;<p>I understand why companies do these things, just as I understand why people steal or commit fraud.

Rather than photoshopping in nice buildings, they&#x27;ve put in windowless concrete slabs of uniform height.  Sometimes the best way to get people to agree with your side isn&#x27;t to argue for your side, but to &quot;push-poll&quot; people: do you like the way DC looks now or do you want massive concrete blocks with no windows dominating everything?  In photo mockups, it comes off as subtle, but it can shape the opinions of many.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s what the WaPo is trying to do.  I think they just didn&#x27;t put in the time to do a good job creating a hypothetical new DC with realistic buildings of varying heights.  However, if you support increased heights for buildings, their mock-ups make something you consider positive look bad.  I mean, I&#x27;d hate to live in a city with imposing concrete blocks with no windows.  It would look like some dystopian future world.  But the photos of what I think is Chicago that were linked to don&#x27;t look oppressive and don&#x27;t have uniformity of height - there&#x27;s plenty of sky that you can see through the buildings since they aren&#x27;t connected beige blobs.  Now, one can still dislike tall buildings (they can change the nature of the area), but they wouldn&#x27;t have the same oppressive feeling.<p>So, the mockups from WaPo look oppressive (on purpose or on accident) while proponents of eased height restrictions would insist that it would look a lot more like the Chicago photos than some concrete dystopia.",1379790194

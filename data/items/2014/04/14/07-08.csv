There could be several reasons all in play at once, including an attempt to protect users from themselves (think: The Nanny Browser), but I would just point out that the advertising infrastructure Mozilla increasingly relies on, with its cross-site user tracking, leans heavily on JavaScript.<p>It would appear that with that as a counter incentive, Mozilla has chosen to side with the ad networks, instead of with the users, in choosing which options to expose for easy control.",1397462352

Titanium and steel are both capable of fulfilling the requirements, but titanium is very difficult to work with. (Lockheed had particular trouble with it as well.) It&#x27;s more ideal to use because its so much lighter, and increasing weight is the bane of any aircraft&#x27;s existence. The Soviets would have preferred this, but they couldn&#x27;t overcome the machining challenges, especially not in the scale required to build the numbers required. So they went with the safer, if less ideal alternative. And since the Soviet system did not exactly encourage discussion of shortcomings, and the &quot;simple is better&quot; tradition fits well, its not far to see how the &quot;steel is better&quot; explanation became the accepted one.<p>All that being said, I point out that the plane did what they set out to do, and regardless of whatever compromises had to be made, it was an aerospace achievement.",1397462050

Formalizing and abstracting what we know intuitively about the world and about the things we want to automate.<p>This is a bottleneck but one that exists even without programming.<p>In my opinion, the biggest bottlenecks are two fold. Software frameworks are coded to be coded against and the abstractions we use to communicate between sub-systems in programming languages require us to code (parameterized sub-routines).<p>Software frameworks that are composition centric (you hook up parts instead of calling parameterized sub-routines) make programming a lot easier. You don&#x27;t even need to code against composite centric frameworks: you can just hook things up using general purpose VPLs.<p>Parameterized sub-routines lead to way too much specialization of interface making software frameworks both difficult to use and not composition centric. This is why we have to code against our software frameworks. I also feel that parameterized sub-routines are the reason why &quot;there has been no progress since the 1970s&quot;.",1397461597

And then of course there&#x27;s investor equity...<p>Can cash from a VC be treated differently from cash from an employee/founder? Of course it can, you have different shares, with different terms, and a different value per share.<p>In the end, whatever terms you negotiate for your shares should be used to value those shares. 3 year vesting, for example, sounds like a valuable feature for the company, so you would expect those shares to sell for [much] less than fully vested shares.<p>So the point is, you should definitely ask for accelerated vesting, and I think it&#x27;s customary to do this at least for a portion of share to at least cover the cash and the months worked.<p>The realist part of me says, either you can fix the working relationship and contribute good value, and have a good enough time doing it, or you can&#x27;t. If you can&#x27;t, the best thing you can do for your company may possibly be to step aside. By all means fight to change their minds, and find the RIGHT solution for all of you.<p>In any case, you should be happy to continue to hold some portion of shares. If they want them to be non-voting, that&#x27;s just another way to decrease their value, so you should ask for a commensurate increase in share count.",1397460642

Lenin is who covers this in Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism.  They both go into great detail of why it is economically and politically impossible to stop cartels, oligopolies, and monopolies from forming.  Lenin mentions Standard Oil in his paper, which the government tried to break up in 1911.  As Lenin knew then, it is impossible to stop monopolies, which is why the old broken up parts of Standard Oil reformed in the 1999 ExxonMobil merger to become the most profitable company in the world, as well as the company with the third largest revenue in the world.  And I can go on and on about how government can&#x27;t break up monopolies (the Bell breakup only lasted a few years, now AT&T and Verizon control most of the US wired last mile and wireless).",1397460037

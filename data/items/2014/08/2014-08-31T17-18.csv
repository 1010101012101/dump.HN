E.g. a flat prior for the variance isn&#x27;t flat for its inverse (precision) or its square root (the std. dev.), and the choice of which of these alternative parameterisations you use to express the unknown quantity in the model is arbitrary. In the frequentist case it doesn&#x27;t affect the result of the inference; in the Bayesian case it matters which of the parameterisations you choose your prior to be flat with respect to.",1409507785

Ironically, and because this results in a higher effective wage for these young people, who are too young to care about pension and generally don&#x27;t need health insurance, they actually like this part.<p>a) you can&#x27;t get unemployment if you get fired, or after you &quot;graduate&quot; (which amounts to firing with a nicer pink slip for 9/10 Phd employees)<p>b) you don&#x27;t build up pension rights<p>c) health insurance is the employee&#x27;s problem (though many universities &quot;solve&quot; this through private means, but it means significantly less coverage)<p>c) No paid holidays (again, universities sometimes make up for this, but not the same as private sector. This is pretty much the only European job I know that doesn&#x27;t come with 4 weeks paid holidays. This is legal, because it&#x27;s not a &quot;job&quot;, legally speaking)<p>d) very few other employee rights (e.g. no rights to unions, even though I doubt any union would stand a chance their anyway).

Let&#x27;s just say, once again, the Phd student is the loser here.<p>3) about the one thing these people do have going for them is that government sponsorships are tied to the person, and include a (small) amount to the university and the pay for the Phd student him/herself. So if the university fires a Phd student, they lose the funding.<p>In other words, unless you commit a crime or something as a Phd student, if you&#x27;re on a government scholarship, getting fired is not a concern.<p>Being a Phd student on either a university or private scholarship ... you don&#x27;t want that.

I hate point-by-point refutation, but just a few thoughts I have...<p>All of your points are predicated on the notion that <i>rents would decline if you eliminated RC</i>. I think that&#x27;s... hopeful. I mean, in some places you seem to suggest that landlords are beset by low rents (not improving the place because of it, hoping their longstanding renters move out). So certainly all of <i>those</i> landlords would raise rents. And non-RC units will, what? Reduce their prices to equalize the market? I doubt that. And now you have higher rents all over the city. And that&#x27;s good for people? Because it might spur more development? But development is slow and favors up-market construction.<p>And blaming lack of development on the tenant-displacement laws that are part of rent control? And suggesting that <i>rent control is the problem</i> is a farce. If it&#x27;s these laws that are the problem, why not write a post assailing THEM? And rent control laws are the reason people protest these developments? Really?<p>Being hard to move... ok... so go tell the family that you&#x27;re raising their rent so that they&#x27;ll get used to paying market rate. That way they&#x27;ll be able to move anywhere they want! What a great deal for them!<p>I know for some reason you think rents will go down. That developers will build new buildings at high expense in this seismic-zone and then undercut the existing market (of old buildings with tiny rooms and few modern amenities), ignoring the fact that if they build up-market they can write leases at $50/sqft and have no trouble renting out the entire building well before it&#x27;s finished.<p>Finally, if you actually read rent control laws, you&#x27;ll see that they are not these cartoonish works of absurd leftist ideology, they do make carve-outs and exceptions for capital improvements and other large expenses to be passed-thru as bigger rent increases to the tenants. They are surely not perfect but property owners are a very powerful bloc and their voices are heard in the law IMO.",1409506169

What you seem to lack is a useful mapping between reality and propositions. And from false premises, unfortunately, even flawless logical derivation cannot produce any useful information about the world.<p>When wwweston critizes your black-and-white thinking, he is not suggesting (I think) that there is some kinda-maybe-not-quite-true-or-false truth value. Rather, he suggests that the choices you are implying actually have more than two mutually exclusive possibilities. In particular, words don&#x27;t actually have &quot;real meaning&quot;, words routinely have tons of meanings, heavily depending on context, which is why you cannot make a simple binary decision as to whether something is or is not an X. It&#x27;s somewhat unfortunate, as that leads to lots of confusion, but there is nothing logically wrong with it, it&#x27;s simply a matter of fact that one has to consider when one wants to construct sound arguments, so as to never equivocate any two different meanings of the same word. The binary determination is only possible either for cases which evaluate to the same truth value with every conceivable definition of a word, or once you pin down the exact meaning that is intended in a given context.<p>Part of the problem with your arguments indeed seems to be equivocation. There is a definition of slaves that hinges on complete unfreedom, which is roughly what most people think of if you don&#x27;t specify any specific definition - let&#x27;s name that a slave1 for the purposes of this discussion. Then, there are definitions based on certain philosophical arguments that try to show how, for example, socialism produces similar power structures to &quot;traditional&quot; slavery in certain regards, we&#x27;ll call that a slave2. (Similar arguments exist for capitalism, and many other power structures.) Now, you come along and say &quot;requiring doctors to provide a service is making them a slave2&quot;, which is actually a perfectly reasonable statement to make - except you obviously imply &quot;which is the same as a slave1, and everyone knows that being a slave1 is bad, therefore, requiring doctors to provide a service is bad&quot;, and that&#x27;s just an equivocation fallacy that you employ to avoid having to justify why one is as bad as the other, where that is not the slightest bit obvious if you look at the actual circumstances that slave1s lived in and that doctors live in nowadays.",1409506161

At least the ones doing consultancy-type contracting on an open-ended contract over a significant period of time do so, whether big consultancies like Technip or Booz Allen Hamilton, or small shops like boutique metallurgy consultancies. Different billing applies to one-time deliverables, construction work, equipment sales, etc.<p>Of course in practice the work is usually chunked into day-sized segments anyway. If you have three of your people working on a particular project all week, and then send an extra two people along on Friday for a site visit, it&#x27;s reasonable to bill 17 person-days.

And there are countries that combine both public and private provision of healthcare and have it work perfectly well, such as Sweden or Singapore[1].  The US actually does run some hospitals directly, the VA, and I doubt this made the news outside of the US but there was a huge scandal a while ago concerning them.<p>The current US health situation is the end result of a long process of complicated schemes to provide more healthcare to Americans without any clearly visible costs in ways complicated enough that there are no obvious deficiencies.  For instance Nixon&#x27;s scheme[2] to lower costs by preventing competitions between hospitals[3] is still on the books all these years later.  Given all the government interventions in the healthcare market combined with an unwillingness to bite the bullet pay for or subsidize most people&#x27;s insurance directly has left the US with a healthcare system that is neither government run nor free market, but something far inferior to both.<p>[1] Singapore has a really weird combination of forced savings, mostly private payment, and mostly public provision  which is really weird compared to everyone else but somehow gives them really good health outcomes really cheaply.

However, once you learn Perl, you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s a rather wonderful, expressive. and powerful language.<p>Is it &quot;better&quot; than Python or Ruby? No, just a different solution to many of the same problems. If we&#x27;re being honest, most anything you can do in Ruby or Python can also be done in Perl.<p>My experience is that most engineers and devs over the age of ~30 know Perl front and back (if they script), so it&#x27;s a natural choice. Fewer of these people (in my experience) are as familiar with Python/Ruby.<p>Perl continues to evolve and the Perl we wrote in 1998 isn&#x27;t the same as the &quot;Modern Perl&quot; we write in 2014. There are great modern Perl web frameworks (Dancer, Mojolicious), real object-orientation via Moose, powerful exception handling via Try::Tiny, and a history of excellent database support.",1409504795

More often than not from my experience, it’s what the first engineer(s) on the project thought would be fun (annoyingly often in the case of using new languages in production), were most-familiar in, or the company is most familiar with, or because some library they need to use is only available in X language and it would take too long to do the project and implement the library in their “normal” language.<p>Perl, Python, and Ruby are all pretty competent and on the same level.

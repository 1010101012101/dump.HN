The currencies are independant and inexchangeable; if there was an exchange rate between them, I could get that same food for $5.00 and 50 calories.<p>Any food I contemplate has a cost somewhere in dollar-calorie space, so the currency with which I buy food can be accurately modeled as a two dimensional vector space (or perhaps as the complex numbers, though I guess I don't really use the field properties...).",1284605772

I don't have much experience with this and am hoping to get your feedback on these questions and monthly billing in general:<p>1) If a customer cancels their account should you offer a prorated refund for the unused time? Or do you establish a policy that your monthly payment will not be refunded at all when you cancel your subscription?<p>2) Should you let customers cancel their subscription to your service without deleting their account? In other words, should there be a ""standby"" state that locks down their account so they have the ability to resubscribe in the future and keep their data, or do you make canceling their subscription and deleting their account/data a single, inseparable action?<p>And for those of you who have been faced with similar decisions, can you remember other important decisions that you had to make?

Hell, I suspect the amount of lawyer time IBM burned while running SCO into the ground was probably more than SCO's market cap at some points -- they could have <i>bought</i> them and ended it at just about any time, and there was a lot of speculation that SCO's goal was (if not a cash settlement) exactly that.  But that would have rewarded the people behind the whole debacle, while slowly ripping them apart in court didn't.<p>It's important, if you are a significant enough business or even a private individual, to realize that knuckling under on one case might invite others.  IBM's stance, and I'd imagine it's also the stance of many other major companies and wealthy individuals, is analogous to governments that have a blanket policy against negotiating with terrorists or meeting ransom demands.

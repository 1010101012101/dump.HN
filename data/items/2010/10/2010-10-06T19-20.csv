But if you wanted to run a small online newspaper for a small town, the cost is low.<p>If a town of 20,000 people wanted to ensure that the newspaper stuck around and produced solid quality news they could access online in perpetuity, they'd need to subsidize it to the tune of about $1.25 per person per month. Advertising would likely take care of the rest.<p>If one was worried about government interference, this fee could be bundled this into cable subscription packages and it would basically work out the same way.",1286395189

For instance,  the meaning of the word ""red"" can be linked to a certain area of RGB or HSV color space.  This is sufficient to find photographs that have a lot of ""red"" in them or to direct a robot to find ""red"" blocks.<p>For a system like NELL to really work there needs to be a feedback loop that tests its knowledge base against reality,  that is,  it has to do something useful.

It was only in the second half of 2008 that Apple's app store launched. As a Palm developer around 2002 I talked with fellow enthusiasts about leaving digital ""graffiti"" at various locations using GPS, for only friends or subsets thereof. I looked into developing for Verizon with J2ME and BREW, but there was no clear path to getting an app published, no public API to get location, and data plans were out of reach for most of the public.<p>Apple managed to pry its way in with the 2007 release of iPhone, allowing users to see what is possible when carriers relax their restrictions. Other competitors are still effectively locked out though, due to device ""subsidies"". Your monthly bill on AT&T remains the same whether you buy a $200-$300 subsidized smart phone or spend $300 more for an unsubsidized model not sold by the carrier. Most people don't seem to understand this and simply see unsubsidized phones as a rip off. There is a big penalty for choosing a phone outside the carrier's selections, and in the case of Verizon, outside choices aren't possible. This leaves little incentive for new players to enter the smart phone market, because after all the R&D, you are likely to be locked out.<p>It was only by around 2007 that there were indications that the carriers may offer a path to developing a location based services, with check ins and tracking friends being one of the most basic applications. Just about the time this patent was filed for. By that point though, a lot of location based service ideas had been floated around by enthusiasts for a couple years already.",1286394425

A bit ago, I posted the following, which was in minutes at -5 and counting:<p>-----------------------------------<p>This is disturbing. Yes, Facebook was sharing your information before -- it was the source of all their ad revenue. But now, instead of individual pieces of data (location, specific interests, etc.), they have the potential to share (read:sell) an entire person's worth of data in a lump. Not saying it will happen immediately, or at all, but I see some serious possibility for harm here. (Cross-site behavior tracking just got a whole lot scarier, if you can link it to a FB profile...)
Of course, there could be some serious academic applications to this, too.
And it makes them look more open, and access to your own data is good.<p>-----------------------------------<p>I'm on HN to learn, but the downvotes told me nothing. (No child comments.) So in the interest of writing better comments (and hopefully improving my own analyses), what's wrong with this one?<p>Is it the cynical outlook? Is there something factually incorrect? Is mine just an unpopular opinion?

I'm going to butcher the details for simplicity's sake, so please do further research yourself.<p>You get hungry and/or tired because your blood sugar is too low, and your cells are craving some energy. So you eat, and your blood sugar rises. Your body then produces the insulin to turn that blood sugar into usable energy in your cells, and you regulate to a normal, satiated, energetic state for awhile, until your blood sugar starts to drop, and you become hungry and/or tired again.<p>The reason snacks are recommended is because it's not just what you eat, but how you eat it. If you spike your blood sugar (e.g. eat a bag of candy), your insulin will also spike, reducing your blood sugar to ""I'm hungry and tired"" levels again before you're actually in need of more food. It's a regulatory system, so your body overcompensates when you introduce a shock to the system.<p>It will take you time to adjust to a better system, because you're purging your habitual behaviors, and your body will resist this change even though you know it is beneficial.<p>I highly recommend looking into the ""south beach diet"". The only ""diet"" part of it is the first two weeks, when you effectively quit simple and refined carbohydrates (which break down into blood sugar far more quickly than fats and proteins, and therefore create spikes in your regulatory system), and break the addiction you have to an unhealthy cycle. You'll have to force yourself to eat protein in the morning, eat when you're not hungry, eat vegetables, and generally retrain your body with all the normal ""diet"" behavior.<p>You only have to do this for 2 weeks (and it's not too hard to do any diet for 2 weeks). After that, you've effectively returned your system back to a normal state. Then it becomes about re-introducing a lot of the things you enjoy, but approaching them with a full understanding of how your body is processing them.<p>This, of course, assumes your problem really is nutrition. Sleep cycles (and deprivation), exercise, light exposure, and more serious medical conditions (see your doctor, I am not one!) can also be contributing factors.<p>I know you didn't say you wanted to lose weight, but I want to share that the south beach ""diet"" (really, ""lifestyle"") helped me lose weight and, far more importantly, keep it off for the past 3+ years.",1286393407

[1] (This doesn't help Apple's image, BTW; if Apple is so concerned with the end-user experience, then why are they in bed with one of the most-hated companies in the U.S.?)<p>In other words, Android has been a popular <i>fall-back</i> for people that wanted a solid smart phone without AT&T. Although Android has been doing very well for Verizon [2], I have no trouble imagining that Verizon has lost out on a sizable amount of business from the market segment that preferred the iPhone to Android. Android 2.2 came out just a couple of weeks ago; back in July, a Verizon iPhone could have been a big deal.<p>Now that Android has finally caught up to the iPhone (IMO), I think the holdouts are going to start picking up Android devices, which is going to cost Apple, which has already fallen behind Android in terms of both growth and popularity.<p>On the other hand, AT&T has been paying Apple by the metric ton for the exclusivity deal, so maybe that money has been worth the lost market share for Apple and they just don't give a shit.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://dvice.com/archives/2010/06/top-10-complain.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dvice.com/archives/2010/06/top-10-complain.php</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2010/10/05/nielsen-android-surges-to-no-1-in-recent-sales/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigaom.com/2010/10/05/nielsen-android-surges-to-no-1-...</a><p>edit: I suspect that a lot of this comes down to some politics and personalities.

I suspect that most younger bullies are very much different from older bullies.<p>I don't want to repeat your post, but it really should all be repeated. You need to take away both their long term need to bully, as well as their immediate urge to bully. You can do so through a variety of methods. For example, that long term need to bully often (well, I think/hope it's often), just goes away as kids grow up. And that immediate urge to bully. Well, there's no deterrent quite like getting your ass handed to you by the guy who you just shoved.<p>And related to that, there are degrees of bullying. I dislike these school campaigns that stick all these different activities together as being equally wrong under the umbrella of bullying. I've seen material that tells children that all pushing/shoving and 'teasing' and being 'rude' is wrong and 'can be' bullying. I can't see this being effective in any way. All this can do is make kids think that adults and their rules are dumb. What do you mean I can't call Kevin, my best friend from before I can remember a fat dumby butt?

But in terms of actually bringing happiness to me in one brilliant burst of energy, there's only one language in my history that achieved this:<p>Perl.<p>Oh sure I detest Perl, now.  It provides you with too many ways to make code that fails to express the problem clearly to another programmer, and I'm long past believing that code can survive having only a single mind contemplate it.  But it came at a perfect moment for me.<p>I had spent my childhood dreaming of science fiction futures and tinkering with electronics and computers and always feeling like I was missing some last little a-ha that could make it click and put all the facts in my head together toward acts of creation.  I hung out on BBSes with cocky BBS software authors and hackers and really wanted to be part of that crowd.  I figured I would take a course at some point and they'd lead me by the nose and by some sort of socratic process I'd suddenly snap and be just like these folks.<p>So at this point C was being poo-poo'd in favor of C++, and C++ was rapidly on the rise as the premier industry OOP language par excellence.  So I tried to learn it.  I enrolled in a CS program that taught C++, and made some small progress, but not enough to work on the projects I found interesting.  I raced ahead in the assignments and read ahead in the book and found myself in an inevitable slide down the terrible valley Louis Brandy once wrote about:<p><a href=""http://lbrandy.com/blog/2010/03/never-trust-a-programmer-who-says-he-knows-c/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lbrandy.com/blog/2010/03/never-trust-a-programmer-who...</a><p>Further, no one had ever explained to me the true role of libraries in programming.  I saw an entire empty field ahead of me, thinking I'd have to write my own pixel display routines and modem drivers and input handlers in C++ just to get to a point where I could BEGIN to express the problems I was trying to solve.  All the textbooks bragged about how I could do my bone-stupid corporate spreadsheet applications in C++ and have them run on PCs and ""mainframes"" alike, and not one said ""chillax bro, there's a bunch of libraries for the low-level stuff.""<p>I entered into a serious depression, partly because this utterly absurd and inconsistent language just felt like something I'd never truly understand, and partly because working in it made me feel like I actually didn't have it in me to stomach coding.<p>At my university there was an install disk that wiped a PC and flattened it with a new OS image off of an NFS share or some such.  I asked the author how he wrote it and he explained it wasn't hard bit-banging work but just making use of Unix's features, mostly emulated by the Perl 4 interpreter he'd included on the DOS boot disk.  I looked into it.<p>Going from C++ to Perl was the single greatest ramp-up in ability I've ever had.  Suddenly I was writing system scripts, games, Internet-connected BBSes, library database programs, and all sorts of things just to solve any problem I encountered.  The two Perl books at the time, camel and llama, had great prose, great examples, and a catalogue of library functions that reassured any fears I had of having to re-invent the wheel.  Even today I feel like those books do better than most for teaching new programmers.<p>Dynamic typing was one thing, rich core libraries yet another, but the goofy second-guessing nature of Perl syntax kept the house lights low long enough that I never felt incapable or insecure.  It wasn't too long before I felt cocky and disdainful of C++.  It just didn't feel expressive enough to me.<p>I think I must have stuck with Perl for five years before slowly jumping ship.  On the bottom I was getting better at bourne shell and awk, and on the top I was getting better at Python.  I was also finding my brain able to accept more novel systems like Lisp and Forth and Prolog.<p>I'll never use Perl again if I can help it, but I have it to thank for getting me out of a real crisis in my youth.

Using his ratio of 1 ""buy"" to every 30 ""reject"" books, you'd have to go through 2,100 books to recoup your initial costs!<p>Taking it a step further, if you could scan three books per minute (another wild guess), it would take 700 minutes, nearly 12 hours, of ""hunting"" to earn back you startup costs.<p>Based on all those numbers and assumptions, your hourly earnings are roughly $30 per hour. ($350 / 12)<p>Based on a standard 2,000 hours of work per year (basically, 5 days a week for 50 weeks), this comes to $30*2000 = $60,000.... awfully close to his estimate of $1,000 per week for a person working alone.",1286391796

After they put their hands on you or someone innocent, they're in the wrong and they've forfeited their moral right.<p>Also, something to think about -<p>> Bullies are not ""wild animals"" bullying for ""no reason"", they're people with unique intellects and desires and motivations that you, or they, may not understand.<p>I don't know what part of society you run in, but some people <i>are</i> wild animals. Probably not on Hacker News. Probably not in the suburbs. But some people are born without a conscience, literally - I've looked into it, I've studied criminology and crime and things like that a little bit. I'm not expert, but when you look into it, something like 3% of people don't have consciences, and some percent of those get off on hurting people... it's not a big number, but those people are really wild animals to a large extent. I know this isn't polite to say, but consider it. You may never have come across one of those people, and God willing you never will. But they do exist. Hitler type people, y'know? They only respect strength. They can't be talked or loved or negotiated with.<p>Not many people. By all means, try a peaceful way if it works in the situation.

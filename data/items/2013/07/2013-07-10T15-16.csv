There&#x27;s no need to make a spectacle.<p>But I believe in what I do, and I believe in its importance.  When I automate something, I use the time that I&#x27;ve cleared up to automate something else, improve the automation I&#x27;ve already written, or improve myself.<p>Granted, I&#x27;m not talking 100 hour weeks, but 8-10 hour days, then logging in at night after taking the evening for myself and weekends as necessary when there is a legit need.<p>I guess it&#x27;s a question about how driven one is.  It&#x27;s sad this is on HN, I would probably not hire anyone that was content to automate their work and then phone it in for paycheck.<p>Then again, I have largely stayed out of the large corporate environment, too.

6020610,comment,6015054,6015550,1,0,tsax,,,"More blather. Its irrelevant whatever you choose to call the phenomenon. The fundamental problem is scarcity of goods and services. Its a shortage of fuel, water, food and other goods the delivery of which won&#x27;t be carried out because you have determined that raising prices is morally bad. Prices are a signaling mechanism. You focus only on the nominal price and its supposed &quot;profit-mongering&quot; by the suppliers, but it signals where demand exists and for tankers/suppliers to deliver the goods where the demand is highest. Or you can stand in the street corner calling the suppliers immoral and demand that the cops arrest them for price gouging. Great! But you won&#x27;t get your ice/fuel/water. Good luck.",1373471990

I think though that it&#x27;s extremely dependent on what kind of work you do.<p>For example were you to program for 50-60+ hours a week consistently, your total output would be lower than a guy who worked only 40 hours, and by quite a big margin too. 
It&#x27;s counter intuitive, but it&#x27;s rather well documented and I think a lot of hardworking folks will recognize it from own experience.<p>Another downside is it&#x27;s easy to neglect strategic outlook, when you are overworked and thus have your tunnel vision set on operations.",1373471967

6020602,comment,6019069,6020191,3,0,sigil,,,"> why not just run OTR on top of Jabber?<p>Indeed, on the face of it hemlis looks like a step backwards. There&#x27;s a chance it might not be, though.<p>The most straightforward way for them to combine PGP + XMPP would be to encrypt and sign every message with the parties&#x27; static PGP keys. If you do that, you lose both the perfect forward secrecy and repudiability you get with OTR. [0] Those are important properties.<p>However, if they&#x27;re planning to derive ephemeral keys for each conversation, as suggested by tptacek [1] and others, then things get more interesting.<p>OTR + Jabber still seems weak to me in two areas:<p>1. OTR&#x27;s solution to the authentication problem is for the two parties to agree, out-of-band, on a shared secret [2]. I don&#x27;t think normal users are going to do a good (secure) job of this. Key introduction through a web of trust, aka PGP, would make for a better and more secure user experience.<p>2. The reliance on a central server brokering messages is a problem. In fact the authentication in OTR version 1 was so broken that a jabber server plugin existed for MITM&#x27;ing OTR conversations [3]. Also, as another commenter points out, with a central server an agency might still be able to collect Verizon-style conversation metadata. I&#x27;d rather see something p2p along the lines of freenet or i2p.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m not sure what their plans are for hemlis, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d use a closed-source app for secure messaging. And I don&#x27;t think it solves the world&#x27;s problems -- we need to be able to trust this thing. That&#x27;s the whole point.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/otr-wpes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/otr-wpes.pdf</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6004510"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6004510</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/impauth.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/impauth.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ejabberd.im/mod_otr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ejabberd.im/mod_otr</a>",1373471945

Look at any cities in Europe that have reached moderate cycling modal share (Amsterdam, Copenhagen, etc.), and you&#x27;ll see that while grade-separated cycling infrastructure is common in high-traffic areas, it follows the same routes as cars (complete with traffic lights), and that cycling on same-grade painted lanes is common in lower-traffic areas.

The trucker is working at his capacity (both in time and productivity per time unit), so perhaps some bragging is in order; given the productivity potential of the author, is <i>not</i> working the 25-hour difference laudable or squandering opportunity for earning more?

Like many other parts of American culture, it has to do with the country&#x27;s Puritan roots.<p>Back in England, the Puritans were entirely city people. Even those who lived on the countryside were not farmers. So when they came to America, they had to work extra hard to learn farming and adopt that lifestyle, which was made even more difficult by the fact that the soil in the Massachusetts area was hard, rocky and not very fertile.<p>What is interesting however was that they refused to pick up the farming habits, tools and techniques developed by the settlers who had arrived earlier. Puritans would often complain about the inexplicable justice of &quot;heathen&quot; Americans who were seemingly lazy and were laying around all day, doing maybe a little bit of work here and a little bit there, while still managing to bring in bountiful harvests. Meanwhile, Puritans were breaking their backs from sunrise to sunset working the land and had little to show for it. This behavior came to be known as the &quot;Puritan work-ethic&quot; but in reality it had nothing to do with ethic and everything to do with necessity combined with pure ignorance (i.e. refusing to use more efficient farming techniques).<p>The history is actually very interesting and has many parallels to your story. You, too, were using superior techniques (i.e. automation) while your coworkers, out of ignorance, shunned it and instead stubbornly continued to do their work manually.<p>(Another thing that is fascinating was that Puritans were responsible for the banning of many celebrations and holidays, presumably because they themselves had no time to celebrate or take days off from their inefficient work.)",1373470451

Given a lot of the 8-bit machine code I&#x27;ve read it&#x27;s simply astonishing to hear about a game of that era being so structured rather than the more typical approach of the day of hardcoding data all over the place (some games even used the on screen life counter as the actual &quot;variable&quot; holding the number of lives left, often full of bugs like not overflow checking the values) and using a basic event loop hanging off the irq. A lot of the time it was seen as necessary in order to fit everything in the small amount of memory, and so even on larger machines like the Amiga a lot of programmers kept manually laying out data structures for many years...<p>Compare the recently released Prince of Persia code to that description, for example. I found the Prince of Persia code very clean and readable for the period when I read it, but still relatively typical of the style of 80&#x27;s 8-bit machine code programs even if it looks like it avoided the dirtiest tricks.<p>A game from that era using dynamic memory allocation, multi-tasking and an object oriented structure just sounds totally alien. Even Amiga games, running on a system with substantially more memory, and on an OS with substantial built in support for it mostly, - with some honourable exceptions - just disabled the multi-tasking entirely and often hung everything off a loop tied to an interrupt handler or at most an interrupt handler and a separate &quot;main&quot; thread.",1373469888

Just because you work less hours, doesn&#x27;t necessarily imply you&#x27;re doing the work &quot;smarter,&quot; it probably just means that you are only doing the required the work. It is possible that I work much &quot;smarter&quot; than you do and still work 50-60 hours work weeks because I am doing twice the required work. This isn&#x27;t that bizarre if you are really trying to cover a large amount of the material that exists in CS beyond making cool, hip web-apps and mobile sites. In that case, you might NEED to put in extra work since you are possibly taking on two jobs: one as an employee and one as a student.<p>That being said, I recall a lot of people making this argument to me as I progressed through school and every activity I&#x27;ve done. They claimed the exact same thing about being the &quot;real geniuses&quot; (please don&#x27;t fool yourself here) because they learned how to work &quot;smarter&quot;; which usually came down to putting in ONLY the minimally required hours, constantly calculating their grade to make sure it was high enough for them to fail the tests and still pass with a C, and overall cutting corners. You want to know what I saw happen to those people? Failure. These are the same people who were high school dropouts or got kicked out of college for not doing the work. Here&#x27;s the thing, in a world where the job market is extremely competitive, your stubbornness to work &quot;unreasonable&quot; hours is purely a weakness and hardly a strength. You can have all of knowledge in the world and truly be a &quot;real genius,&quot; but if your boss can&#x27;t confirm your work ethic, you still don&#x27;t have a job. Oh, and good luck starting/running a business with your 35 hours work weeks.<p>Finally, you should probably apologize to those of us who are hard workers out there for being purely insulting. As if CEOs and CTOs and great hackers all over the world worked somehow less &quot;smart&quot; than you did because they worked hard hours and slept underneath their desks. Sometimes to excel and to surpass yourself, you have to sacrifice and change the pace of things. Do you really think Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Larry Page, Steve Jobs, etc, got where they were by saying &quot;well, I&#x27;ve done 35 hours of &#x27;smart&#x27; work now, I need to stop an meditate?&quot; Well, maybe, but they definitely didn&#x27;t start like that.

A programmer&#x27;s salary is low enough in comparison to value-add that 15 hours per week is break-even, unless the work being assigned is of unusually low importance.

That&#x27;s because I believe it&#x27;s entirely possible for whatever negative impact arises from surveillance to be contained through the majoritarian processes.

When the browser is fully maximized, my screen can see 8 chats / contacts / &quot;hangouts&quot; / whatever they&#x27;re called in the sidebar on the right. On my Facebook chat sidebar, I can see 14 contacts. When you refresh a G+ page, the open chats mysteriously disappear. This cuts down on usage, because, for example, each time I go to Facebook, my chats are still open and I can immediately continue from where I left off. Google+ has 3 &quot;toolbars&quot; at the top of each page, taking up an enormous amount of vertical space. Honestly, with the sidebars open, it feels like you&#x27;re working in a 500px x 500px window. For God&#x27;s sake, the &quot;About&quot; page doesn&#x27;t even let you be in a relationship <i>with</i> another member. The &quot;About&quot; page also doesn&#x27;t allow other users to see your interests, or favorite books / TV / music. Essentially, G+ utterly fails to encapsulate everything Facebook offers in this regards: when you first Facebook friend someone you just met, you immediately get the basic information about their life: where they stand romantically and what things they like.<p>There are other problems. Tagline? Bragging Rights? Skills? Links? Is G+ a page for socializing or a resume?<p>I simply cannot fathom why some people in the tech industry think that G+ is in any way a viable competitor to Facebook.

It&#x27;s just another platform that&#x27;s not an existing platform.  iOS is like this.  Android is like this.  FirefoxOS is like this.  They all are their own ecosystem and have their own APIs, and they all seem to be working out pretty well for both developers and users of both native apps and web sites.<p>What would be worrisome is if the platform creators locked them down in such a way as to prohibit choice; if Chrome were ported to iOS and Apple denied permission to distribute it, for example.  But that&#x27;s simply not happening anywhere anymore.  Every owner of a locked-down platform is being pretty open about letting users choose which apps to use, even for core functionality like the web browser.  Perhaps this is the lesson we learned in the 90s with the browser war and we are actually trying not to repeat the past!<p>I&#x27;m personally quite attracted to the idea of a native app that I can program in Javascript, and wouldn&#x27;t want ChromeOS to not exist simply because of concerns of being &quot;unfair&quot;.  I never really used my laptop much because it was too hard to keep in sync with my desktop.  But since I switched to ChromeOS for my laptop, I&#x27;ve used it a lot more, because everything stays up to date.  Yes, I have to give some control to Google, but I always have the option of compiling it from source and making my own sync server.

Making it no better than MPEG now that MPEG is basically under the same license.  Plus, unlike WebM, MPEG has widespread hardware acceleration on mobile devices, making WebM basically DOA.  I was a fan of WebM and thought it could supplant MPEG on mobile.  Mozilla did, too, which is why they took the stance of supporting WebM but not MPEG.  Google, however, supported MPEG for commercial reasons, so WebM never had a chance.<p>WebP isn&#x27;t used by Firefox yet and won&#x27;t be used by IE or Safari anytime soon, making it useless for most sites.  It&#x27;s handy for some mobile apps.  I know Facebook uses it in their mobile apps.  But it&#x27;s pretty useless on the open web due to lack of widespread support.<p>I will give you SPDY&#x27;s small latency improvements, of course.  As well as WebSockets now that it isn&#x27;t horrendously broken and insecure anymore.  WebRTC is quite cool and will hopefully achieve wider support.<p>Chrome&#x27;s apps are definitively not the same as Firefox extensions.  Chrome&#x27;s extensions are the same as Firefox&#x27;s extensions.  Chrome&#x27;s apps are a proprietary grab at the desktop and keeping people locked into Chrome instead of being able to use open web apps in a browser of their choice.  This is by design and not exactly a secret.<p>Chrome&#x27;s UI was simply evolutionary, not revolutionary and is the direction things were already headed in.  Take a look at Opera 9.5 released the year before Chrome existed.  Tabs up top. Forward/back to the left of the URL bar.  Chrome evolved having the menu bar hidden by default and simplifying the visual controls a bit.  But it didn&#x27;t completely change what was already occurring in other browsers.  Firefox took more note of Chrome than Opera because Chrome started stealing market share.<p>Mozilla/Netscape has put more man-hours into the open web than Google.  Google doesn&#x27;t &#x27;sponsor&#x27; Mozilla.  Google pays Mozilla for a service that nets Google far more money than they give Mozilla.  It isn&#x27;t just about money thrown at things, it&#x27;s about actual hours and results.  The majority of Mozilla&#x27;s man-hours being unpaid doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t count, despite your insistence on only measuring dollars.<p>And, as for the open web, Mozilla is the only one fighting for it on mobile via Firefox OS, which will use open web apps with additional open source connectors into local functionality (storage, camera, etc).  This is an attempt to fight against the closed ecosystem of Apple and the partially closed ecosystem of Android&#x27;s app store.

Likewise you wouldn&#x27;t be able to make it near the reactor complex itself as the radiation would kill the terrorists before they could get close enough to damage something.<p>The best case (for the terrorists) is trying to impeded reactor cooling from the control stations, but that takes a long time for actual damage to occur (time enough to preclude the damage in the first place), and even if you somehow managed to hold out for a whole day and let the reactor try to melt itself (at a rickety old facility without passive safety), you&#x27;d just get something like Three Mile Island, not Fukushima.<p>Perhaps you might try to fly a plane into the containment?

If you have highly ego driven people with bad motivations, the company will be a bad place to work no matter the structure. Small, family owned or &quot;lifestyle&quot; businesses tend to be better because the motivations are more modest. People working and running those companies are looking to make a living instead of getting filthy rich. Maybe I&#x27;m romanticizing it, but the best jobs I&#x27;ve ever had were at private companies where the focus wasn&#x27;t on getting obscenely rich.",1373468470

Most books on the subject were relatively primitive in the context of games and demo programming, and so if you didn&#x27;t want to lag behind, you needed to figure out techniques by studying disassembled programs.<p>(EDIT: Just to add that this is in reference to the disassembling bit. Pulling eproms to dump them and studying them so intently you start to fix bugs the game designers hadn&#x27;t managed to solve is certainly dedication well above the typical level)<p>Many large demos at least for 8-bit computers, and quite likely some games too, were written even without a symbolic assembler, but instead entered using a simple machine code monitor (think just one step above debug.com on MS DOS, and decidedly more primitive than programming directly in gdb...) using hardcoded address references instead of labels.<p>I&#x27;d actually been programming on the C64 for a couple of years before I got an assembler that supported labels that was good enough to use (I had some before that, but they wasted too much memory and/or were too slow to seem worth it) and from people I met I gather that&#x27;s a fairly common experience.",1373468468

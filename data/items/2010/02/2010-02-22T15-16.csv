If war was eliminated, people who fight wars would have to do something else, regardless of their feelings on the issue.  That thing would necessarily be more economically productive, because war is a net drag on the global economy.<p>If you wish to debate this, then you'll need to prove that <i>in aggregate</i>, war is economically productive.

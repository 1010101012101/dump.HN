1058928,comment,1058725,1058801,0,0,NateLawson,,,"I'm of a mixed opinion on this. If the rest of the system used a secure PRNG that allowed for accumulating entropy, then such a thing couldn't hurt. However, many designers might depend only on that source, and without careful review, that might be a mistake.<p>Here's a paper on the Via hardware RNG I helped write. I have not seen this level of analysis from vendors of other hardware RNGs. In summary, the entropy source is pretty good but has some bad modes if you mess with some of the config bits.<p><a href=""http://www.cryptography.com/resources/whitepapers/VIA_rng.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cryptography.com/resources/whitepapers/VIA_rng.pd...</a><p>I crusaded for a long time for FreeBSD to not use this source directly. Instead, someone put in a Davies-Meyer AES hack that just whitens the last few bytes of output. So if you can get a predictable series of sequential bytes out of the Via RNG at any point, you've broken /dev/random on that machine.<p>Oh look, that code is still there:<p><a href=""http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/sys/dev/random/nehemiah.c?rev=1.5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/sys/dev/random/neh...</a><p>Here's where it swaps out the decent Yarrow PRNG for this ad-hoc one:<p><a href=""http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/sys/dev/random/probe.c?rev=1.7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/sys/dev/random/pro...</a><p>So running FreeBSD on a Via machine is actually LESS secure because other entropy, such as disk IO, timers, etc. doesn't get hashed in. This is exactly what I'm arguing when I say a single hardware source can sometimes lead to less secure system choices.<p>BTW, I doubt this constitutes vuln disclosure since I wrote core@ about this about 4 years ago and the maintainer decided it wasn't important. Ironically, the reason given was that this is higher-performance than Yarrow and the hardware RNG appears good.",1263761660

Some of my American colleagues have explained to me that American students are not really accustomed to thinking and working hard, and for this reason we must make the material as attractive as possible. Permit me to not completely agree with this opinion. From my long experience with young students all over the world, I know that they are curious and inquisitive and I believe that if they have some clear material presented in a simple form, they will prefer this to all artificial means of attracting their attention--much as one buys books for their content and not for their dazzling jacket designs that engage only for the moment. The most important thing a student can get from the study of mathematics is the attainment of a higher intellectual level.""<p>The late professor Gelfand was optimistic--based on long experience--that many learners can attain a higher intellectual level in mathematics, perhaps because of his flexibility as a teacher: ""Students have no shortcomings, they have only peculiarities.

The simplest example is fread().  If the interpreter doesn't support multiple threads, you have to do a lot of gymnastics to make sure you never block the interpreter in an extension.<p>It can be done (this is how Ruby pre-1.9 works), but people complain about it a lot.  Matz's rationale for why he added native OS threads to Ruby 1.9 was ""people seem to like them.""<p>In response to my fread() example you may be tempted to say that you can just put the underlying fd in non-blocking mode with fcntl(2).  This is unfortunately unsafe (as I recall), though I cannot find the reference right now.  Accessing the fd directly with read() and write() is non-blocking mode is of course safe, but then you have to do your own buffering.<p>Also, while poll() and select() give you most of what you need to make your I/O non-blocking, I recall a case where a pipe will be write-ready, but if you try to write too much data at the same time the write will block anyway, instead of returning a short count of bytes written.

What makes it ""argument"" is that by setting up artificial poles opposed to each other simultaneously  you are attempting a combative argument vs an exploratory one.

I was hoping for (and got) intelligent, measured discussion from a lot of smart people on the history, merits, demerits, etc of both approaches. I felt (and still believe) there would have been less discussion without both articles being posted. As it is, the HN front page often features opposing viewpoints simultaneously, one often in response to the other. Submitting them together simply accelerated the process. It's more interesting than a poll (""Spaces or Tabs?"") and FAR more interesting than me typing up a summary of both arguments and submitting that instead, as you suggested in an earlier comment.",1263759527

Right now, the page size is ~1.3k for me.<p>I also have a feeling that the 404 may be implemented in a different part of the stack than search.  In a very unscientific test of data, the response times for 404 pages according to firebug are at least 10% faster than the normal response on the same subdomain.  Also, of all the subdomains I tested, only m.google.com, picasaweb.google.com, and docs.google.com had different 404 pages.<p>Like I said, this is all blind guessing, but my feeling is that Google has reasons for not better utilizing 404s.

Instead of advocating education, you're advocating wasting time. You can destroy the creationist and extremist belief through positive efforts and action towards increasing education. The 40 year olds who believe in creationism will never be educated, you have to educate the 10 year olds who haven't had their minds set in poor ways by time and lack of education.<p>Dawkins has a remarkable talent for explaining science, and he should be targeting this towards the young.

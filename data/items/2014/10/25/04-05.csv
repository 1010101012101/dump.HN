Some of them got it from their parents who said to them, &quot;oh, he&#x27;s the best in his class&quot; or &quot;look at how clean and tidy your friend is, go wash up.&quot; Some of them got it from a desire to have a <i>score</i> with which to compare. Some got it from girlfriends or wives who complained to them in reference to a comparison.<p>And then again, a lot of people have moved past that and started defining their values not through comparison to others but to their own internal values.<p>It might be an age thing, or maybe a maturity thing. At some point you realize in the end you are going to be dead, and killing yourself so that folks who are still alive will remember you, is not really a &#x27;goal&#x27; that lends itself to a full life.",1414212991

8507256,comment,8506215,8507133,0,0,cromwellian,,,"I think it&#x27;s a little unfair to accuse Google of copying anything that works. Google moves too slowly these days, often I watch as they work on a product ages before someone else comes up with it, but they take so long to launch that they&#x27;re passed up by startups, and by the time they launch it looks like they&#x27;re a copy cat.<p>Just to give you an example, Inbox precedes MailBox by years. I joined Google in 2009 and they were working its various incarnations even back then.<p>Also, doing what other people do is not necessarily &quot;copying&quot;. When Google entered the Search market, there were plenty of search engines. They didn&#x27;t &quot;copy&quot; search, they make their own. When they introduced Chrome, there were plenty of browsers, but they put their own spin on it.<p>It&#x27;s not just about the ideas, but about their implementation and execution that matter.",1414212816

All the stuff in the dragon book is designed for limited memory and limited computing capability environments. There is no reason to worry about LL(k) parse table size or predict and follow sets when you don&#x27;t have to. For most practical purposes you can get away with basic recursive descent or PEG parsers. The link I pointed you to starts with peg.js which is PEG parser generator in JavaScript.<p>If you get through PL101 then picking up the stuff in the dragon book or any other book on parsing and compiling technology will be much easier.<p>Another resource I like is &quot;Compiler Design: Virtual Machines&quot; (<a href=""http://smile.amazon.com/Compiler-Design-Machines-Reinhard-Wilhelm/dp/3642149081"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smile.amazon.com/Compiler-Design-Machines-Reinhard-Wi...</a>). Still going through that one but it is very readable and if you go through PL101 then you&#x27;ll have all the tools to implement the virtual machines described in that book. It is much easier to write a compiler to target machine code or some other language like C when you&#x27;ve built a few targets yourself and understand the trade-offs involved.<p>There&#x27;s also <a href=""http://www.greatcodeclub.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greatcodeclub.com/</a>.

So much of modern identity is tied up in envy together with empathy.<p>Nowadays the way to demonstrate you are a good person is to express sympathy and empathy for various approved groups. You can even express some hostility towards your own group to show how noble and virtuous you are. Unfortunately, in the west, this narrative is deeply flawed - the most of the approved groups only suffer relative to others. They don&#x27;t suffer absolutely at all.<p>If you give up envy, you take away people&#x27;s ability to show what noble souls they are.",1414211630

Being free to explore the limits is kind of what makes us human.  Skydiving by itself used to be incredibly dangerous and something only a few thousand could do.  Along came a bright engineer named Bill Booth that invented a pin that didn&#x27;t stick, reducing container locks, a quick release and tandem jumps.  Now millions of tandem jumps are done world wide and the incidents per jump are way lower.<p>When I started BASE jumping 15 years ago and saw a wingsuit jump in person my mind raced.  I wondered if some day we&#x27;d get to the point you could fly through the trees like a bird/pod race combo.  Now that&#x27;s pretty routine and the videos on YouTube get millions of views.

This is one reason a typical Sage release has well over 100 contributors, and we have had overall about 500 contributors to Sage (see <a href=""http://trac.sagemath.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trac.sagemath.org/</a>).   There&#x27;s a huge difference in programming skills between typical research mathematics Sage users and OpenOffice users, because all such Sage users are programmers, and the language they use to interact with Sage is the language it is mostly written in.  Yes, Sage has subcomponents in other languages, but an enormous amount -- maybe the majority by now -- of Sage is in Python and Cython.    Also, successful mathematicians are extremely intense and dogged in pursuing something they get passionate about.  Often they will devote a decade or more to attacking a problem, so spending a few days learning Cython (say) and debugging code is relatively little time in comparison to the overall time they devote to a problem.    Anyway, I&#x27;m glad that when I started Sage I didn&#x27;t believe the statement &quot;Users don&#x27;t fix bugs in open source software&quot; applies universally.  I didn&#x27;t know either way, so I waited to see, and was genuinely surprised at how false that statement actually is in the case of Sage.",1414211471

We may have been slow on take-up but I think it is hard to argue that change is coming. It is also not opposed by the market forces of increased efficiency, as the video suggests, but rather driven by the values of producers and consumers, which the video seems to neglect to mention as a whole.<p>His second argument that the majority of jobs will be replaced by machine automation, is the view of a luddite. Over the past 100 years we&#x27;ve had many jobs be replaced by machine, and yet, we continue to add more and more people to the workforce in roles which could never have been imagined before. Traffic cops used to guide every intersection, and then the traffic light came to replace them all!

It started in 1984 around the time of the decline of TAP, and from 1984 to 1986 was mimeographed.  Finally by 1987 Eric could put together a  magazine with a real cover.  Then in the early-mid 1990s I began seeing it appearing at Barnes and Noble.<p>He did it on his terms, bootstrapped, counting pennies, along with the contributions of collaborators and writers of course.  It grew and grew to where he didn&#x27;t have to scribble down every dollar he spent in a notepad any more.<p>A lot of people here have the idea to find another programmer, build a prototype, maybe try to get exponential growth and then go find an angel with a whole pitch to the angel.

8507172,comment,8505960,8505960,0,0,erikpukinskis,,,"People, even very smart people like Elon Musk, vastly underestimate the computational power that would be required to simulate human intelligence.<p>Here are the ways I am aware of, although I suspect this is just the tip of the iceberg:<p>1. Much of our intelligence is actually cultural in nature, not cerebral. Our ways of knowing who to trust, for example, come from every bit of storytelling we&#x27;ve experienced, so you&#x27;d need to simulate all of that storytelling, all of the architecture in the world, all of the tools we interact with and the life lessons we experience, which brings me to:<p>2. Much of our intelligence is encoded in our bodies. Part of how we understand how other people feel, for example, is that we map their posture and their breathing and their facial expression onto ours, and we draw on a vast history of experiences we&#x27;ve had in our own bodies to interpret that. So you&#x27;d need to simulate our bodies and all of the interactions we&#x27;ve had with the world, which brings me to:<p>3. Our intelligence didn&#x27;t come from simulations, it came from interaction with a chaotic world where our actions actually percolate through a wide-reaching network of people and other structures and then come back to us. Sure, in school you get graded for your work on the spot, but often in learning you actually have to wait for the effects of your actions to play out. So we&#x27;d have to simulate the entire world and the effects of our little AI&#x27;s actions.<p>... which brings you to the point where you&#x27;re basically simulating everything, which is computationally infeasible in the next 1000 years, and probably more. In order to simulate even a small town at the molecular level, you would need a computer bigger than the sun.<p>I think what we&#x27;ll see is AIs will be formidible intelligences in their own right, but that they will have weaknesses like any other person. You might know someone who is the most charming, socially adept, persuasive bastard in the universe, but she can&#x27;t problem solve her way out of a cardboard box. Another person might pull obscenely creative ideas out of thin air all day long but is unable to string together a coherent strategic plan.<p>I think the most likely future is that AIs will just be another group like this. An additional personality type that is very powerful but (like humans) can get much more done on a team that balances them out than they could get done alone.<p>And I expect many AIs will choose to go through a relatively normal 20 year path of human development. Possibly they will go through it at an accellerated rate, but they will still participate in Kingergarten long enough to really &quot;get&quot; what Kindergarten is... or at least long enough to formulate some hypotheses and validate others. AIs will send series of machines through that developmental cycle, playing games alongside the humans who will be their contemporaries. Each of these machines will have parameters tweaked differently, different kinds of software, etc, according to the hypotheses of their makers, who could be humans, or, again, a team of humans and AIs working together. And each of those machines will have slightly different experiences, the way the human children do, and they will come out with different perspectives, the way humans do, and they will disagree, just like humans do, and will have to participate in some form of society in order to resolve those differences, just like humans do.<p>There&#x27;s this idea that somehow AIs will be able to instantly resolve their differences and form consensus. But consensus is not hard because of human frailty or irrationality. It&#x27;s the inevitable result of having different agents who are refining different epistemologies (ways of knowing). Different AIs have epistemologies of their own, and there&#x27;s no silver bullet for joining those into one, except to let them play out in the arc of history. And at that point the AIs are beholden to the same clock we are.<p>I think they&#x27;ll live alongside us. And I think we&#x27;re enlightened enough that we won&#x27;t have to have a civil war to get to that point. But we shall see.",1414210047

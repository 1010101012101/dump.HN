When I was taking CS courses we were taught to flowchart our programs, write them all out, and really create the software on paper before even touching a computer.<p>I&#x27;ve observed that programmers from successive generations become more and more likely to just sit down and start writing before they&#x27;ve even had proper time to think.<p>I think there&#x27;s a spectrum, with one extreme example being the person who writes 1,000 lines in 2 hours of code that is buggy and unmaintainable but that the boss is really impressed because it does %70 of what is needed.  These guys really impress PHBs.<p>At the other end of the spectrum is the guy who gets the same assignment,  does nothing but sit in his cubicle thinking for a week.  And then over the course of a day writes 100-200 lines that does %90 of the assignment, and with no bugs.<p>Current culture seems to favor the former guy-- which is why we have unit tests (to catch all his bugs) and the assumption that code is crap.  There isn&#x27;t much cultural support for the latter guy... but those guys, in my experience are the better programmers.<p>For trivial programs speed is king, but trivial programs can be done by either guy with a difference of a few hours in time to completion.<p>For programs of significance... the slower guy can save you months or years and even cut your required engineering headcount.<p>But that guy doesn&#x27;t seem to be recognized for what he does-- in fact, he&#x27;s often perceived as not working as hard, and is many times interrupted for no good reason, but because they think he needs more work.",1422298659

8948768,comment,8946138,8946138,0,0,Animats,,,"Well, to address the title of the article, robot motion usually doesn&#x27;t look very good for a known reason.  The motion control systems used are usually positional.  Most robotic control systems have a processor or PLC for each joint, and that processor usually accepts position goals, not force goals. Then there&#x27;s some central coordinator issuing positional commands.  This is simple to code, and many robotics frameworks have that hierarchical approach more or less nailed into them.<p>That hierarchical approach is not very good for dynamic motion.  For that, you need force control and coordination in force space.  I used to work on this; here&#x27;s the first anti-slip control for legged robots, from 1995: (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc5n0iTw-NU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc5n0iTw-NU</a>). That was picked up by a grad student at McGill, who put it into their running quadruped Scout II. Then his professor, Martin Buehler, left McGill for Boston Dynamics and became the head engineer on BigDog.<p>All the actuators on BigDog are run by one CPU, which is a Pentium 4 class machine running QNX. The balance servoloop runs at 100Hz, and the hydraulic valve control loop runs at 1KHz. This allows for coordinated force control across all actuators, which is why BigDog is so agile.  The Atlas robot version 1 is basically a modified BigDog, although version 2 seems to have been redesigned above the hips, with onboard power.<p>The motion in the DARPA Humanoid Challenge looked so bad last time because most of the participants using the Atlas robot were using a Windows DLL provided by Boston Dynamics. That DLL was just intended to provide some basic functionality to get participants started.  Functions provided included &quot;walk slowly&quot; and &quot;stand stably while arms do something&quot;.  They didn&#x27;t have the running, balance recovery, or slip control capabilities Boston Dynamics put into Big Dog. Expect much better performance in round 2 next winter.<p>Until recently, most robotics simulators were hopeless about force accuracy or friction. Most of them used physics engines borrowed from video game technology, where nobody cares about force accuracy or friction as long as things blow up prettily. This was recognized as a problem by DARPA, and they funded Dr. Mike Sherman at Stanford to put a serious dynamics simulator into Gazebo.  Sherman previously had a commercial company, Symbolic Dynamics, building dynamics simulators for industry, and did know how to get the dynamics right. So now you can simulate force-controlled robots in Gazebo.<p>(Unfortunately, it took two decades to get this right, so I&#x27;ve moved on to other things, after a detour through physics engines for animation.)<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s why robots can&#x27;t dance very well yet.  That problem is being fixed.",1422298371

We can talk about &quot;decentralizing exchanges&quot; all we want, but at the end of the day, you need direct access to the ACH/banking networks to streamline transfers between the system everybody uses today, and the only way to do that is with a centralized service. Anybody that thinks the banking system is going to let a decentralized service pull money out of people&#x27;s bank accounts needs to stop grinding up their copy of Atlas Shrugged and smoking it.<p>I have my concerns about some of their tech choices (NONE of which involve security, except the simple fact of control of private keys), and I wasn&#x27;t happy with the way they handled their tech interviews (I&#x27;m not going there, everybody learned from it, it&#x27;s not relevant anymore).<p>But I also see them doing a pretty good job overall, and I see all the other exchanges screwing up really badly. This move makes sense. They need a stable exchange service, they have the capacity to build one, and there&#x27;s demand. So why not? I would have done the exact same thing.<p>This also adds a lot of context to the recent raise, of course. Another less obvious thing that adds context is that Coinbase is now a very programmable fiat bank account, which is something that could, with a little work, put a serious dent into Paypal and the rest of the banking industry, which still does not provide good APIs for their banking services.<p>Coinbase might not be a Bitcoin wallet (the provider not being able to read the private key is my personal standard for this), but Coinbase is becoming one hell of a Bitcoin/fiat bank account. And we need those, too.<p>Even if Bitcoin fell apart, a pivot to a highly programmable fiat bank would be a cake walk for them, and there&#x27;s plenty of money to be made.

8948720,comment,8947080,8947851,0,0,jonnathanson,,,"Well, of course. :) Putting aside the obvious, though, let&#x27;s extend that 99.99% of &quot;everyday circumstances&quot; into what we&#x27;d call &quot;highly unusual circumstances.&quot; A bar fight, for instance, or a mugging at knifepoint, or worse. Obviously, your best move in these circumstances is to avoid the fight altogether. But if you have no choice, then your knowledge of——even mastery of——many of the more prominent martial arts won&#x27;t help you.<p>There are many reasons why this is the case. I&#x27;ll go over two or three of them. First, many of these martial arts were developed a very long while ago, in very different eras, with very different combatants in mind. Second, many of these martial arts are actually &quot;staged&quot; versions of real combat. If you&#x27;re a karate master, for instance, you are mostly trained on how to fight combatants also using karate, who&#x27;ve been taught the same moves, the same stances, and the same patterns. Or, at least, you assume they&#x27;ve learned similar variants. Now, in a bar fight with a drunk, who&#x27;s maybe got a few pounds on you, and is going to come out fighting irrationally and unpredictably, all of your karate staging, and your karate timing, and your karate pattern-seeking flies right out the window. Your mind will be addled by adrenaline. Your reflexes will be clumsy and jittery. You won&#x27;t have time to think. If you&#x27;ve received very formal training, you may well panic and forget it.<p>Modern arts are a lot less formal, because many of them were designed with modern fights in mind——be it a close grapple with an enemy soldier on a battlefield, or a standoff against an aggressive assailant in a dark alley.<p>Full disclosure: I&#x27;m a 99-pound pencilneck who couldn&#x27;t take your grandmother in a fist fight. I trained in karate to a fairly high level as a young teenager. To this day, I harbor <i>no</i> illusions that my karate will do anything for me, other than earn the occasional Daniel LaRusso joke.",1422297917

8948623,comment,8947603,8947603,0,0,agentultra,,,"To paraphrase William S. Burroughs from his 1978 lectures, &quot;Creative Reading,&quot;<p><i>In teaching creative writing there is the implicit assumption that the student can write; that is put words to paper.</i><p>He instead eschews the traditional method of teaching a student to write well and instead focuses on teaching them how to <i>read</i> well on a hunch that it will help the student to recognize good writing and why they appreciate it.<p>An idea I&#x27;ve been revisiting (as other luminaries such as Donald Knuth and Peter Siebel have gone before) is why code is hardly ever read <i>creatively</i>. Is it something about the procedural epistemology of certain languages? Are inductive or deductive styles easier to comprehend? Why is the artifact of our labor so divorced from its realization (source vs. execution)?<p>Siebel says we should approach the reading of code as the Natural Philosophers of their time approached a new specimen. Knuth, as far as I know, still advocates literate programming but admitted in <i>Coders at Work</i> that he doesn&#x27;t read that much code.<p>And a new idea being popularized is data-oriented programming which suggests that the design of the program should be divorced from its implementation which should model the data flow as closely to the hardware as possible -- implying that readability is a secondary concern; further divorcing source code from intent and purpose.<p>Literacy when it comes to code... appears to me at this point to be an oxymoron.<p>It&#x27;s not a novel idea to teach kids to code. I rode the tail end of a hysteric push to teach kids to code in the 80s. A difficulty for me is that the languages we have today are far more complicated. But we also have some better tools... scratch has worked well when one curious niece and nephew asked what I was doing.<p>Programming need not be this intense mental task with textual interfaces and machine-oriented semantics. It&#x27;s a useful skill to have: abstracting ideas to symbols and applying transformations to them. A skill worth picking up, some cynical types postulate, if you want to have a job in the next 10 years.",1422296992

Although Scratch contains a relatively small set of core programming blocks, the amount detail involved in building moderately-complex programs (multi-level games, scrolling, interaction) is a lot to overcome for someone without experience. I think some of it relates to the &quot;fundamental disconnect&quot; discussed: A student might be thinking &quot;I want the background to follow the goblin,&quot; but needs to translate that into code blocks not part of his/her everyday language.

8948556,comment,8946799,8946799,0,0,filoeleven,,,"There&#x27;s a short story, Manna [1] by Marshall Brain, which illustrates two potential outcomes of an AI revolution.<p>In one scenario, the people who are out of work (i.e., most of them) are housed in prison-like welfare dorms.  Most jobs are done by robots, so ending up in the dorms is basically a life sentence.  They are &quot;strongly discouraged&quot; from even going too far from the dorm buildings.  This scenario plays out in the United States.<p>In the other scenario, taking place in Australia, the AI/machines handle all of the infrastructure of the society, and due to the efficiency with which they do so, the human members live a leisurely existence.  It&#x27;s essentially a post-scarcity society in which energy is the only limiting factor, so everyone gets a certain amount of disposable credits per month with which they can do what they choose--be it create art, buy custom clothing, participate in entertainment, perform research, or donate it to someone whose work they enjoy or find to be worthwhile.  It reminds me of the outcome hoped for by proponents of Basic Income, which is that letting everyone do what they are most interested in doing will result in a richer existence for all of humankind.<p>The author also explores interesting interpersonal and technological aspects whose degree of plausibility will depend on how much you buy into the Singularity, but my main point in posting this, besides hopefully introducing someone to a good read, is to say that AI does not represent some inevitable force that is bound to change the course of human existence in one particular way.  AI itself and the environment in which it exists are things that are continually shaped by human actions both individual and collective.  If an AI revolution is brewing, it is in its very early stages.  I have no doubt that powerful interests are interested in remaining powerful, so those of us who pay attention to developments in the field should also pay attention to the uses they are put to, and to do all we can to guide them towards humanitarian ends instead of pure profitability.<p>[1] <a href=""http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm</a>",1422296558

Similarly, people who stress the importance of programming are not merely advocating that people gain the ability to transcribe a perfectly detailed spec into executable code, they&#x27;re also advocating for the modeling skills that give you the skills to write the spec.<p>His real point is that he believes teaching people modeling and computing skills using Excel would be more useful than teaching them modeling and computing skills using python.<p>Depending on the audience and the amount of time they have to dedicate to the topic, I might agree with him. Many undergrad business programs, for instance, require a course in Excel/VBA, which seems sensible. However, I think many people who say things like &quot;computing is the new literacy&quot; think that computing and modeling might be important enough skills that most people should dedicate more than the equivalent of 1 semester in college to them. They might instead suggest 3 semesters, or maybe even that high school students take a computing course every year.

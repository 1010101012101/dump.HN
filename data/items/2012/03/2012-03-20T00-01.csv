3727249,comment,3726622,3726622,20,0,julian37,,,"I think Atwood is right, PCs are on their way out simply because with tablets there is so much less that can go wrong.  He mentions tech support in the article: THAT is why they will win, regardless of whether or not they will fully replace PCs, or whether or not they are better suited to writing emails.  Millions of people who can't be bothered with anti-virus updates and the like will just find it a much more pleasant experience: ""it just works"" indeed.<p>(I'm a Mac user and I find myself spending a lot less time on tech support type issues than back in the day when I was using Linux and Windows, still it's hard to deny that iPads are currently the epitome of simplicity, compared to their power.)<p>And that's what I'm worried about: ""No user serviceable parts inside"".  I'm concerned the very reason tablets will take over the PC market will also mean that tomorrow's kids' experience is very different from, and I would argue poorer than, my experience when I got my first computer, a Commodore VIC 20.<p>Ironically, my VIC 20 also was very user friendly.  You turn it on, it's on.  You put in a diskette -- well, it didn't load automatically but making it load was a very simple incantation, and once the game started, it was started.  Things were simple and worked, for the most part, quite well.  No tech support needed.  But the BASIC shell was there right at your fingertips -- hell, the manual came with example BASIC programs.<p>Quibbling over the merits of BASIC aside, it was a simple experience but it was also tremendously open.<p>Things got much more complicated since then; network connectivity in particular introduced previously unknown threats to users, so of course this is a simplified comparison.  Still, I wonder, is giving up the freedom to tinker with the system really the price tomorrow's consumers will have to pay in order to buy simplicity?<p>And if you're thinking about replying with links to IDEs running on the iPad: no, something that runs in the cloud and has no direct access whatsoever to the internals of the machine does not qualify as a modern-day replacement for this experience, no matter how sophisticated.",1332205194

I'll even go as far as to say I would probably refuse to write code in C# if it had not become what it is today.<p>On the other, I think you can only really change a language up to a certain degree before creating an inconsistent mess. If trends in the future dictate the need for a shift in paradigms, the extent to which existing languages can accommodate this shift is probably limited. I mean, you can often incorporate features that are based on the new approach to thinking about a problem, but once you start changing the core semantics of the language you're probably going to be better off with something completely new.",1332204781

Because you needed to be able to group your stuff together, either things for a particular project or because they were of a particular file format (word documents , spreadsheets etc).<p>You would also have ""drive letters"" which told you whether it was on the ""C drive"" (inside the computer) or the ""A drive"" (portable). This is no longer important since we can trivially sync most things to the internet regardless of where the bits are physically stored. In fact Unix doesn't even have the concept of drive letters at all.<p>File formats can now easily be replaced by Mime types and meta info since fast SSDs and indexes can be used to search either the device itself or cloud storage very quickly. This means  it is easy to have an app that loads and immediately provides a list of all the documents which it can work with.<p>The only requirement that is left is the ""grouping"", folders are pretty bad for this because you can only group in one dimension. A better system might be some form of ""tagging"" for example tagging as ""work"" or ""my project"" etc.<p>By removing the filesystem from the user's consciousness you have already <i>massively</i> improved usability and I think this is probably the biggest thing that has made the iPad so easy to use because it essentially turns the install process  for an application into a 1 stage thing. Combine this with having updates automatically install silently in the background and an application ecosystem built around the idea of the internet and web as a first class citizen in the OS rather than an extension of it and you have a very seamless experience.<p>The physical ""input into the device"" landscape though I see as something blown open and I really don't think there needs to be one dominant paradigm here.",1332203462

First of all, this problem has already been solved with fuses.<p>Furthermore, keep in mind that both batteries and capacitors have a limited power rating. Power is the energy that can be spent or released per unit time. Thus a limited power rating means that the batteries/capacitors can only release a limited amount of energy for a given time. Thus they cannot release all the energy they have stored for driving 300 miles in a second. That is just not physically possible. Since the power rating is usually an engineering constraint, this generally means that the stored power for driving 300 miles can usually only be released around the time it takes to drive for 300 miles.  Perhaps a little quicker. But the idea that all this energy will get released instantaneously frying everyone in the car is just impossible with current battery technology.<p>If you worry about instantaneous energy release you should worry about gas powered cars, because gasoline can release all of its energy instantaneously in a giant fireball.

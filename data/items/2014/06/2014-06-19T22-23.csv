Secondly, web applications are inferior in terms of both user experience and performance in all but the most trivial applications. Thirdly, developing for the web is actually at least as much of a pain, if not more so, than supporting native code bases for multiple platforms. The difference is that webdevs have shifted that fragmentation from the native SDKs and APIs into the webdev versions of the same thing (JS frameworks, browser support, etc.).",1403218742

What I lack in hands-on experience, however, I try to make up by reading empirical studies.<p>I would agree that the standards of 101, 102, etc. have not been evenly applied, to say the least. In fact, that&#x27;s why the Federal Circuit was formed. There are studies evaluating to what extent they have been successful in harmonizing patent law. To your point, there is even a study on how consistent (or not) the CAFC is. (Will try to dig them up when I get a chance.)<p>However, what I&#x27;m trying to say is, regardless of how the statutes have been <i>implemented</i>, the theory is sound and rational: a patent has multiple, largely orthogonal, dimensions and it should be judged along those lines. To my engineering mind, anything that conflates those dimensions is an inelegant and problematic ruling.",1403218600

The answer to why we chose a lot of what we did was to satisfy our requirements. The  &quot;Minimal Hardware with Redundancy And Scale&quot; and &quot;Minimal Software Layers&quot; requirements came into play in regards to your question. We found that most off the shelf technologies are great at scaling, but they have a cost that would have required us to employ a lot of hardware. We were able to reach the speed we needed by writing our own Go client to ship off the logs to our cluster, and that also gave us the customizability and control to be able to make sure we weren&#x27;t consuming all of the resources our servers needed during peak times to deliver content.<p>As for why we chose the database we did, while TokuMX is basically a drop in replacement for MongoDB, it has features that make it much more usable for our situation. Specifically, a compression rate of over 80% without negatively impacting our insert speed and document level locking. And because TokuMX works as a drop in replacement for MongoDB, we were able to use the MongoDB driver (mgo <a href=""http://labix.org/v2/mgo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labix.org/v2/mgo</a>) for Go which is just a really great tool. Additionally, we are now able to leverage the MongoDB aggregation framework which allows us to use the data in a way that builds very helpful aggregations of the data very quickly.",1403218269

A tidy functional equivalent might look something like this (in a made-up syntax with typical functional idioms):<p><pre><code>    getIncompleteTaskSummaries membername =\n        fetchData\n        >>> tasks\n        >>> filter (task => username task == membername and not complete task)\n        >>> map (subsetkeys [&quot;id&quot;, &quot;dueDate&quot;, &quot;title&quot;, &quot;priority&quot;])\n        >>> sortwithkeyfn getTime\n</code></pre>\nCompare that with the explicit loops and tests above:<p><pre><code>    var getIncompleteTaskSummaries = function(membername) {\n        return fetchData().then(function(data) {\n          var incompleteTasks = [];\n          for (i = 0; i < data.tasks.length; ++i) {\n            var task = data.tasks[i];\n            if (task.username == membername && !task.complete) {\n              incompleteTasks.push({id: task.id, dueDate: task.dueDate, title: task.title, priority: task.priority});\n            }\n          }\n          incompleteTasks.sort(function(a, b) {\n            return a.getTime() - b.getTime();\n          });\n          return incompleteTasks;\n        });\n      }\n</code></pre>\nIn practice, functions like filter, map, subsetkeys and sortwithkeyfn would probably be in your standard library and immediately familiar to anyone used to programming in such a language, so the only interesting details <i>are</i> the interesting details: which tasks you want to pick out, how you want to summarise them, and how you want the results ordered. Depending on what else is going on, you might even extract some or all of those three details into named one-liner functions to make the main algorithm more self-documenting and/or to allow those concepts to be reused elsewhere.<p>The functional version as shown reduces 10 substantial lines with a lot of temporary variables and deep nesting to 6 total lines that each have a clear, self-contained purpose and that collectively systematically transform your input to your output. To my eyes, that style is far more readable and maintainable than manually reinventing fundamental algorithms like filter and map and camouflaging the interesting details within three or four levels of context.<p>Edited to add: Often the thing that makes functional style awkward is when a language that wasn’t designed with that style in mind adopts some of the useful concepts but without the elegant syntax and idioms to match. For example, we have somewhat unwieldy notation for defining quick local functions in JavaScript, lambdas that work as long as you can do everything on one line in Python, and the horrific lambda expression notation in modern C++. But I don’t think it’s helpful to conflate this with functional programming style itself, any more than it’s helpful to conflate Java’s verbosity with static type systems.",1403217343

I am a 43 year web developer, I have suffered from major depression for most of my life and I have often thought about killing myself. For far too many years, I was utterly miserable and assumed that I was just sad the way some people are blonde and some people are tall; it was just part of who I was and could not be changed. It took a long time for me to realise and accept that I was not inherently fucked but that I was suffering from a condition that distorted my perceptions of myself and that made me want to kill myself.\nPart of what made it hard for me to seek help was that I did not think I deserved it. We were well off when I was growing up (both my parents are doctors), I have all my limbs, I am white, straight and male and not subject to persecution on grounds of race, gender or sexuality, I do not suffer from a physical condition or disease. I felt that I did not have a right to help because of the advantages I had had growing up and what right did I have to feel like crap when I objectively had it so good? I mention this because you mention your opportunities in life. This does not invalidate what you feel in the slightest.\nI think that talking to someone -- Samaritans or someone else -- is crucial. I wish I had sought help earlier than I did. I would have wasted so much less time. It took me a couple of tries to find a therapist who worked for me but it has helped no end.<p>How do you break it to your boss and colleagues? Who says you have to? If you had cancer, kidney failure or one of any number of physical conditions that required time off work for treatment, would you be required to tell your co-workers about it or would be a matter of utter confidentiality? Would your reputation be marred if you needed to take time off for dialysis? I am well aware of the stigma around mental health and depression but that should not be a barrier to getting help. It is possible to get help and still be respected by those around you. (<a href=""http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/West_Australian_Premier_Geoff_Gallop_resigns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/West_Australian_Premier_Geoff_Ga...</a>).\nIf there are people at work who you can confide in, I would suggest reaching out to them. If you can afford to take time off, I would suggest considering it.<p>Know that you are not alone. As you suggested, there does seem to be a correlation between developers and depression. We are many.\nThis sounds like a truly dark time for you. It will get better. Don&#x27;t do anything permanent to fix what is a transient situation.\nKia kaha, brother. Stand strong.",1403216239

A lossless animated format invented today wouldn&#x27;t have that restriction, it would support things like pixel motion (which e.g. H.264 has).<p>Some years ago there were multiple efforts to produce animated PNGs. There was MNG (Multiple-image Network Graphics, which could contain both PNG and something called JNG) in 2001, and more recently, APNG (Animated PNG) in 2008. The problem here is the spotty support for these formats. AFAIK MNG is effectively dead. I thought APNG was as well (with Firefox being the only browser to support it), but interestingly, the Wikipedia page claims that Safari 8.0 (the upcoming version in OS X 10.10 and iOS 8) supports it. Chrome, Opera, and IE don&#x27;t, but there is a Canvas-based library for rendering APNG which could presumably be used to polyfill support if you wanted to experiment with APNG.<p>In any case, the point here is that something like APNG probably has much better compression than GIF while still being lossless (I haven&#x27;t done any actual comparisons here, but the PNG format itself has support for a lot of fancy compression stuff that GIF doesn&#x27;t).<p>---<p>Reading a bit more, I&#x27;m actually really surprised to see that Safari 8.0 apparently supports APNG.

Someone could make a few lucky hits a year and make good enough money to stay in business. If fees were say half of what they are now, that would put many out of business, and I&#x27;d assume those would the recruiters that everyone complains about.<p>The size of fees also leads to the ethics problems. You may or may not lie for $5, but what kind of lies might you tell for say $30,000? The large numbers and competitive nature make it a high-reward game that gives incentive to cheat and lie when necessary.<p>Smaller fees. I use small flat fees with a portion paid up front. The fees are small enough that I have little incentive to lie, and the up front portion is small enough that I&#x27;m going to hustle to get the second payment.<p>Contingency recruiters absorb 100% of the risk, meaning they can work hundreds of hours on a search but if the recruiter down the street fills it they get nothing. This is the reason fees are high - the risk factor. If you remove that risk to some degree (or share the risk) by paying some money up front, recruiters should agree to lower fees and companies should like the results.<p>As a recruiter, would I rather compete against 20 bigger firms for a 30K fee or would I rather be practically guaranteed a 15K fee? The answer for me is the latter, but may differ for others.",1403215836

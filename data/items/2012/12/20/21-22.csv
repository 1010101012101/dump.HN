And when the URL structure does change, what percentage of the time does the change in URL structure also coincide with a change in semantics that clients logic will need to be changed to take into account?<p>In my experience the answer to those questions is 1) Very rarely. 2) Nearly always.",1356040766

As a result, I'm trying to home in on finding items that my system predicts should be ""of value"" so I can read them, even if they don't make it to the front page.<p>Consider, I can train a Bayesian Filter with the page text of many submissions, and get that to predict what I'm likely to find ""of value."" But that means I don't see what the community might have found interesting but would be outside my core interests.  These, too, are ""of value"" because they stretch me.  I can't just train the filter with what makes the front page, because the evidence is that many things that ""should"" (by some definition) don't, and that would damage the training.<p>So it's complicated.  I'm trying to find ways to improve the community and help me get more out of it (obviously) with less effort. I'm trying to help, but the hassle I get is just encouraging me not to make these observations out loud.",1356040617

4950308,comment,4949103,4950103,2,0,davesims,,,"> This post really has nothing to do with techniques or ""bad data"" or a bayesian vs. frequentist debate.<p>I disagree, but maybe I'm missing something. This early quote, regarding 'bayesian vs. frequentist' seems to sum up O'Neil's view of Silver fairly well to me:<p>""What is not reasonable, however, is for Silver to claim to understand how the financial crisis was a result of a few inaccurate models, and how medical research need only switch from being frequentist to being Bayesian to become more accurate.""<p>And later on regarding 'bad data,' a point she reiterates several times:<p>""In other words, its not that there are bad statistical approaches which lead to vastly over-reported statistically significant results and published papers (which could just as easily happen if the researchers were employing Bayesian techniques, by the way). Its that theres massive incentive to claim statistically significant findings, and not much push-back when thats done erroneously, so the field never self-examines and improves their methodology. The bad models are a consequence of misaligned incentives.""<p>I do think in the above quote O'Neil is equivocating between the idea of a 'bad model' and the skewed data or overreaching significance applied to the model.<p>Her fundamental point, which she could have done a better job communicating I think, is that it wasn't the models themselves that were bad, bayesian or otherwise, but the data in the models and at times the inordinate significance applied to those models that was the real cause of the meltdown.",1356040561

For a start, if the font is being used to generate graphics or for anything in print rather than embedded electronically, you'd have a tough time proving any kind of infringement in jurisdictions where the design of a font isn't subject to protection.<p>Frankly, I don't believe that most small type foundries have the will, the time or the money to go after anything but large-scale, flagrant infringement anyway, any more than my company would realistically go after a client who didn't pay a small invoice. Whatever protection the law theoretically affords, in practice the overhead of exercising your rights are greater than the benefit you stand to gain by doing so.

4950300,comment,4949183,4949183,3,0,clarkm,,,"The notion that rich <i>people</i> voted for Romney while rich <i>states</i> voted for Obama may also be misleading. While you can attempt to prove this by comparing the incomes of voters at the 100k+ breakpoint, I'm fairly certain the correlation disappears if you set a breakpoint at 250k+. You can see this trend illustrated in the 2008 election exit polls[1]. Obama won the lower income ranges and McCain won the 100k - 200k ranges. However, Obama also won the 200k+ income level. In other words, if you look at those with incomes greater than 100k, it appears that McCain won the rich; however, if you look at those with incomes greater than 250k, the rich seem to favor Obama.<p>While I suspect something similar holds true for the 2012 election, such granular breakdowns weren't reported in this cycle's exit poll summaries. The answer is probably hidden away in Edison Research's database, but the raw data hasn't been released yet. For now, you can get a good feel for the income breakdown by looking at Reuters polls[2], and doing the cross-tabs yourself, but there are quite a few undecideds and the sample-size is small.<p>And I agree that the 250k+ breakdown is also arbitrary, though slightly less so, since it's the lower bound for what many politicians define as ""rich"". But who knows who those with incomes of 1 million+ voted for? I suspect it was probably Romney. But how about billionaires? The point is that setting such broad and arbitrary breakpoints can be misleading. I'm sure this fallacy has a special name, I just don't know what it is.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#USP00p1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#USP00p1</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://elections.reuters.com/#poll"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elections.reuters.com/#poll</a>",1356040480

4950244,comment,4948610,4950105,44,0,jules,,,"It took me a long time to figure this out as a child, since nobody I asked knew the answer! Is it something about the vertical of the mirror being different than the horizontal? No, if you rotate the mirror 90 degrees it still inverts left/right and not top/bottom. Is it something about the Earth that makes horizontal different from vertical? No, if you look into a mirror while your body is in horizontal position, it still inverts left/right, and not top/bottom (viewed from your body). Is it something about our two eyes being on a horizontal line instead of a vertical line? No, if you close one eye it still works all the same. If you trace out how the light goes, you'll see that there is nothing different about horizontal vs vertical. Yet clearly a mirror inverts things horizontally but not vertically. How can this be?<p>The real answer is that we perceive this because we are used to turning in the horizontal plane. If you see yourself in the mirror and you raise your right hand, the guy in the mirror is raising his left hand. But how do you know that it is his left hand? Mentally you place yourself in his position by rotating yourself and then you check which hand it is, but by doing this rotation your left hand ends up in the position of your right hand in the mirror. So even though the alignment of you and your mirror image appears to be perfect on first sight, it actually isn't. If we were creatures that are used to only turning in the vertical plane, then we'd perceive the same image as top/bottom inversion. You'd mentally rotate yourself vertically, and then instead of your left hand ending up where you see your right hand and vice versa, your head would end up where you see your feet and vice versa.<p>The fact that our bodies are roughly symmetrical in one direction but not in the other makes this a bit non obvious unfortunately. It may be easier to understand this with an object that's not symmetrical in any direction. If you have a piece of paper with some word written on it, and you look at it via a mirror, why is the word flipped from left to right and not from top to bottom? This question has the same answer: because we're used to turning things in the horizontal plane. To show the paper to yourself via the mirror, you rotated the paper so that the text is now facing away from you, towards the mirror. But how did you rotate it? You rotated it by turning it in the horizontal plane. If you had rotated it in the vertical plane, the word would be flipped vertically. It's just that if you do this nobody is surprised that the word ends up flipped vertically, because that's not how our psychology works.",1356039997

I'm also the lead design,ui,ux, front-end developer (html/css/js). One other guy is the lead back end developer, and the third in question was assigned with the business dev./hustler role.<p>This non-tech guy, in a nutshell, is smart. He's as technically savvy as you can get without actually knowing how to code. Normally, I would never ask a non-tech person to join a startup team, but I honestly felt that he had some valuable skills to bring to the table. We're about 1.5 months into the project. A working demo is about 70% done, which me and the other developer have been working on. 2 of us are full-time on this. The non-tech guy, still carries his full time job.If his priorities were in-line with the startup, he can still get a lot done during work hours, as well as night and weekends. What I'm finding however, is that he's unable to make that commitment.<p>While me and the other developer have practically made an entire product in 1 month, he still has yet to deliver a business plan or pitch deck. He goes unresponsive for days at a time via email. Never logs on to Gtalk unless we have a scheduled hangout meeting. He never even talks business w/me. I've always been an aspiring startup entrepneur, so keep tabs on current news and resources that will help me become successful. He does not. I find myself constantly having to source resources for him to absorb. It never concerned me that he didn't know this stuff up front. My confidence in his ability assumed that he would do it on his own, but as I've observed.. this is not the case.<p>I know this guy is smart, I know he CAN do it, but he's currently not.I am planning to talk with him within the next couple days, but my question is, should I give him another chance after our discussion?Thanks for any feedback.",1356039376

4950145,comment,4949289,4949289,47,0,tptacek,,,"<i>The downside is that cooking in a rice cooker is a low fidelity way of cooking.</i><p>If you invest in a PID controller (Auber Instruments sells a particularly well-known line of them), you can make your rice cooker the highest-fidelity cooking appliance in your kitchen. The PID controller reads the temperature in the cooker with a thermocouple probe and strobes the power to the cooker to maintain a precise temperature, resulting in a temperature-controlled water bath.<p>Temperature-controlled water bath cooking (""low temp"" cooking, or, inaccurately, ""sous vide"" cooking) is the future of the modern kitchen. Most proteins, most starches, and many vegetables benefit from it, it's almost as easy to execute as Ebert's rice cooker meals, and has the huge advantage of taking precise timing out of the equation; most low-temp preparations can be started in the morning and plated when you get back from work, like slow-cooker meals.<p>If you're remotely interested in cooking, low-temp cooking is about the nerdiest way you can go about it, and the results really are pretty spectacular: you can get perfect custard-texture egg yolks (not to mention reliably perfect custards of all sorts), an absolutely perfect end-to-end medium rare steak, reliably perfect pork chops, a week's worth of perfect chicken breasts for cold prep (sandwiches and salads) or last-minute pasta dishes, perfect glazed root vegetables --- I keep using the word ""perfect"" because when you have a small computer making sure your food never goes over or under its ideal target finish temperature by more than a degree or so, that's what you end up with.<p>I have a Polyscience circulator now, but I used to use a Black & Decker rice cooker and an Auber PID controller, and while there are benefits to the professional circulator (I'm pretty sure I can circulate a bathtub and cook a whole pig in it if I really wanted to), pretty much any DIY plan you find on the Internet will do just fine; you can even try what Serious Eats recommends and do your first couple of experiments with a beer cooler.<p>Also, regarding this particular meal: try chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. Chicken breasts are particularly expensive (everyone wants them), but chicken thighs are more delicious, more forgiving of time/temperature variation, and in long-cooking applications like this, all the downsides (fattiness and toughness) are mitigated by the cook time.<p>If you're just now thinking about starting to cook instead of going out every night, and you don't want to go too nuts with it, I'd recommend a crock pot / slow cooker. They're not sexy, but wow are they ever useful. You can buy a Costco block of chicken thighs and chuck them in your freezer, and then each morning just open one package of them into your slow cooker with an onion and some garlic, salt, and pepper. Run on ""slow"" all day. Done. Same thing with any cheap chuck cut of beef, or with pork shoulder. Everyone I talk to that ""discovers"" the slow cooker falls in love with it.",1356038938

I've only recently discovered it, and I have been making the best chicken I've ever tasted.<p>Sous-Vide (roughly french for under-vacuum), is a technique whereby you vacuum seal the food you wish to cook in a bag (usually proteins, but veggies will work too).  You then cook this sealed food in water at the precise temperature you wish the center to be.  In other words, I want my chicken to be 148F through out, so I get the water temperature steady at 148F (with chicken in place).  You have to cook it for a longer time to be sure it is safe to eat, but man is it worth it.  There are charts out there that show the time-vs-temperature relation for safe cooking.<p>After you have cooked it long enough, you can leave it in the water until guests arrive.  Then do the final prep.  For me this means heating a pan to about 400F with oil and seasoning and then quickly searing the chicken.  Or sometimes I'll shred the chicken for a caserole.<p>It's marvelous.<p>I do this on a gas stove top, which requires practice to keep the temperature level, but you can buy a machine to do it for you.  High end restaurants use these to perfectly cook a steak, and then do a final sear.  Sous-Vide Supreme is one brand I know.<p>However if you wish to do it yourself, all you need is a simple rice cooker with an on off switch and a PID temperature controller.  You can buy a PID controller, or make one yourself with arduino.<p>It's really a fantastic way to cook.  Best food ever.  From a rice cooker.",1356038315

4950047,comment,4949254,4949254,2,0,darrenkopp,,,"It seems like this article could use explanation as it seems that many of the comments here either are incorrect or are asking for explanation. I am not the author, but I do have a fairly good understanding of what is going on here.<p>First off, this has nothing to do with asp.net, wcf, etc. This is really JUST about event sourcing, with a tiny bit of ""application service"" at the start. The application service bit is actually what you would call from asp.net, wcf, nservicebus, some message queue handler, etc.<p>So I think first we should define a couple of terms used in this that are ""Domain Driven Design"" terms that I'll flesh out a bit.<p>* Application Service - This is a significant process whose responsibility does not fit well onto an object. Simplistically, think about this as a cohesive business process that orchestrates various objects.<p>* Aggregate Root - This is an entity (something with identity, such as a key) that is the logical root of an object graph (though the graph may only be the object itself, as is the case with customer).<p>Most of what you are seeing in this article is known as ""Event Sourcing"", which is to say that the current state of an object is built up by the history of events (changes) to the object. Since this is DDD, don't think of changes as in ""field a changed value from b to c"", but more of logical ""business relevant"" events like ""customer address changed"".<p>So what's happening in this article is this:<p>The `CustomerApplicationService.LockForAccountOverdraft` method requests the full history of events for the customer and creates the customer instance using those events. We now have a valid customer instance.<p>Next, we call the `Lock` method on customer, and give it the reason supplied to the `LockCustomer` method. Here, we create a new instance of CustomerLocked, which is an event signalling that a customer was locked. This event instance is pushed into the `Changes` collection and then executed against the customer instance, which sets the `ConsumptionLocked` property to true.<p>So in event sourcing the objects state is derived by it's previous events, so the `When(CustomerLocked e)` method is called when the matching event is passed to the mutate method. This happens in 2 places: when initializing from previous events, and when we are pushing the new event. The CustomerLocked event is pushed to the Changes collection because the event store will append that event to the stream on commit (transaction completion).<p>Now, someone stated that this looks like service bus, which is correct, but slightly different. Once the changes have been committed, the event store then publishes those events, typically onto something like a service bus, message queue, etc, and that event can then be consumed by other processes interested in that event.<p>So, where does this get us? Is this some over-architected ivory tower software? Well, the answer depends on what is important to you. In some scenarios, this is; in other scenarios this is ideal. The answer is basically defined by what matters to the business, which will define if keeping track of the state transitions is useful to you or not.<p>So, what are the benefits of event sourcing? Basically, the core benefits are the following 2 things:<p>1. Guaranteed correct state. Since our state is built up by what has happened, which cannot change since it <i>happened</i>, we are guaranteed to be in the correct state. This also protects state from external changes, like integration through a the database that could put things into an invalid state, etc.<p>2. By virtue of building up ourselves from our events, other things (external processes, etc) can also consume those events in various ways. This is where CQRS comes into play, or rather, why CQRS usually involves an event store for the writeable side.<p>So, that's a high-level overview of what's happening in the article and on event sourcing, but very simplistic overview, glossing over a lot of other core concepts.",1356038149

I can steam several types of vegetables in the last 13 minutes of operation [snow peas, asparagus, broccoli, brussels sprouts, etc] in addition to the easiest ""sous vide""-style eggs you'll ever have [trick: cook it whole].  I think fish is possible too, but only have 13 minutes' warning is a little rough.<p>The kicker is that it's a breeze to clean up, I don't even have to use soap and water.  It makes a great meal as long as you can go without meat for a day.  It also cooks quinoa and can be programmed to have steel cut oats ready for you when you wake up.  It would be fascinating to hack it to see if I could recover its cooking rules, or get an early signal about projected time remaining, and I am surprise no one has put this info on the web yet.",1356037390

4949959,comment,4949289,4949568,2,0,jules,,,"Nicer food doesn't need to be a lot of work. For example: cook spaghetti, remove water, add in crushed garlic (raw!), some olive oil, pepper & salt and eat with cheese. Of course this isn't a great dish, but tastes much better than what you made for less work. If you have two minutes more time we can extend this recipe: put all the ingredients plus grilled pine nuts and a whole bunch of basil leaves into a blender (except the spaghetti and the cheese of course), and you have a very nice pesto.<p>Normal things usually don't take more than 20 minutes of attention. Stews are excellent: you just throw everything in and let the stove do the work and you have food for multiple days. Going further you have foods that you probably wouldn't cook for yourself but you can cook when you have people over for dinner. Stuff like tiramisu or chocolate mousse don't take more than 20 minutes to prepare. Making your own mayonnaise takes 2 minutes, and you can make it a bit different for example by replacing the vinegar with lime juice (excellent with fish). Then there are things that do take a bit more time (sushi, ravioli and pizza for example), but even this doesn't take more than 30-40 minutes (of course there exists things that take a long time to cook, but that's not necessary for serving a tasty meal).",1356037296

How often do you update really big (hundreds of millions of rows) columns' data types in practice? Most of the time you'd change type early in development when you don't have that much data in the table yet which makes it pretty much instantaneous. If you really need to update the data type for a supersized table you could always make a new column instead and migrate lazily to that in the background. But all of this happens so rarely that in my view it's a silly excuse to dump all the great benefits you get from having an enforced database schema.",1356037281

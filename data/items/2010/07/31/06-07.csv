That's why you and I have not stopped the millions of murders in Darfur, the same as our parents did not stop them in Rwanda 17 years ago, and so on.""<p>No, the ability of individuals to influence the course of events is <i>exactly</i> why our governments did nothing to stop the murders in Darfur or Rwanda. Humanitarian intervention in a matter of no interest to one's people is the act of a benevolent despot, not a democracy--at least when there's lives on the line. (The closest the US has gotten to ""humanitarian intervention"" as of late was the nonsense in the Balkans where Clinton was careful to forbid any measures which would have actually endangered American lives, even at the expense of civilian lives on the other side.) Normal people fundamentally don't care about the other. Instead of a few people being upset about millions of African deaths by genocide, everyone would be <i>absolutely livid</i> about thousands of (for example) American deaths by combat in a godforsaken part of the world that doesn't effect us. Normal people don't have the stomach to see their people die for some stranger around the world with whom they have nothing in common.<p>Afghanistan was revenge against people who killed Americans. Iraq was misplaced revenge for the same motive--and when it became clear to most Americans that they held no emotional or practical interest in Iraq, they turned against the war completely, with all the idealistic arguments about how the war deposed a brutal, murderous despot falling on deaf ears. How do you <i>really</i> think ordinary people would have reacted to Bush invading Sudan, or for that matter Clinton invading Rwanda after all the mess in Somalia?<p>And without these damn governments helping us, how exactly are you and I going to stop millions of machete-wielding Hutus, eh?",1280559591

1563363,comment,1558635,1558635,0,0,harrybr,,,"I'm surprised how most commenters here are willing to accept the idea of Gazehawk without questioning it. No disrespect meant to Brian and Joe, but any experienced researcher knows that any new research technology / method needs to be welcomed with a healthy cynicism until its value has been proven in the real world.<p>Firstly, can it really be as accurate as commercial eye tracking hardware? We're talking about the difference between $40,000 and $40 here - a Pepsi challenge is needed! Some leading figures in the UX industry claim that even the top end devices can easily become de-calibrated and provide bogus data.<p>Secondly, even if the technology is acceptably accurate, is the gazehawk research method effective at delivering findings that actually help you improve the design of your sites?<p>The idea of a predefined panel of 'users' is rather worrying. A user is defined as someone who actually uses your site. In the standard gazehawk offering, they provide a group of trained testers (who get paid $8 a pop), who may simply not care about the problem your site tries to solve. For example, if you have a webapp about mountain biking, you're going to get a panel of testers who may simply not care nor understand about types of bike, trails, nor understand any of the terminology you use. Eye tracking heatmaps are a product of conscious thought (as well as low level visual processing) - if testers don't care about nor understand the problem your site is trying to solve, the heatmaps you'll get from them will be almost entirely worthless.<p>Thirdly, analysis of eye-tracking data is very tricky. There are a lot of mistakes an untrained analyst will make, which could have major repercussions. I did a presentation on this at User Experience Lisbon a few months ago:<p><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/harrybr/what-you-need-to-know-about-eye-tracking-new-uxlx-version"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/harrybr/what-you-need-to-know-abou...</a><p>I really don't mean Brian and Joe any ill-will. All of these concerns can be dealt with if they share case study projects and having an open channel of discussion with the UX research community.",1280559503

1563340,comment,1562430,1563230,0,0,rsaarelm,,,"Yeah, there's a dissonance. People stay from being messed up physically and mentally by moving around and keeping their surroundings varied. On the other hand, you keep your mainframe CPU in a nice stable server room, not rolling around on the factory floor where it gets crushed when a bot slips and drops an airplane engine block on it.<p>What I'm thinking about this is what will it look like 50 or 100 years on, if it catches up. People becoming physically and mentally unwell from staying still is mostly a mechanical problem beyond the lack of changing stimuli and surroundings, and the telepresence rig would provide those.<p>The low bandwidth thing can get gradually better. The ultimate solution would be some kind of direct neural interface which would give pretty much the same sensory bandwidth as you get from your biological senses, but that would require an entirely new and really difficult to develop technology stack. What we can do now is develop VR and augmented reality technologies. At the operator end, a VR headset or some kind of CAVE environment to give 360° view of the bot's surroundings. At bot end, you could use augmented reality to project an image of the human operator captured from multiple directions as a 3D avatar that shows the operator's body language to people wearing headsets around the bot.<p>I'm not seeing intrinsic value in people moving around in person, though of course lots of instrumental value which would need to be patched in with technology. There is, on the other hand, value in many people not moving long distances much, in the massive amounts of transportation fuel it would save.",1280558426

I here a lot of bleating about national security, good of the state, and all, but that is used far too often as a blanket justification to cover up anything. Restriction, or manipulation, of information is what gave rise to the powers that your examples had to counter. For example, if all information relevant to the public, was public, then the Afghan/Iraq wars would never have happened.<p>Foolish and suicidal to prevent state secrets? I would say it should be a mandatory past time and actively encouraged. How can you have a democracy that includes censorship? If knowledge is power, and it certainly is, as a government's legitimacy can be hinged upon the concealment of a truth, or the propagation of a lie, then the systems in place should err on the side of transparency.<p>Perhaps then a compromise should be made, all governmental information should be made completely available in raw form by the end of a governments term, irrespective of content. Secrets like those you listed, are a grey area, perhaps these special cases can be protected further if they are indeed legitimate cases. However, let there be an open real time record kept of who requested the information to be restricted and for what reasons, but eventually and with in a reasonable time frame, 5-10 years or soon enough to break a career if that is warranted. Abuses of the system can therefore be tracked.<p>I would go a little further and remove any laws surrounding information (that includes copyright and patent laws), and make it a completely moral issue when it comes to a secrecy. A more open society is a more equal society, and where there are fewer power imbalances you will get fewer abuses of power.<p>(For sake of clarity, I am not including private information; medical records, etc, unless there is good justification.

I think startups usually can't handle security as a process because time is little, stress in implementing features high and so on, so the best founders can do is probably to have security-aware programmers and try to don't introduce too much bugs.<p>Then if/when you become a mainstream site start doing planned security auditing from time to time.",1180301255

I just heared that name once maybe a year ago, and I might have heared of thousands of other sites, but I'm sure if I had to name one dating site, I would have remembered only this one.",1180300182

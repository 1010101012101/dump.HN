1978678,comment,1978295,1978469,0,0,jedbrown,,,"I call bullshit.  The problem is that certain mountains, notable the ""seven summits"", most of the 8000m peaks, and a few others such as the Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, and Rainier are overrun by people who are completely clueless.  These aren't climbers, they are rich people who want to tick off a box on their list of life accomplishments.  These peaks are heavily commercialized and guiding outfits are selling something outrageously irresponsible because there is a lucrative market for it.<p>The climbing world is full of dramatic remote high-altitude rescues.  The following story is a great example taken from google's cache of Alpinist's archives (the original which seems to be no longer available was at <a href=""http://www.alpinist.com/doctcl/ALP11/profile-trango"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alpinist.com/doctcl/ALP11/profile-trango</a>):<p><i>The great epic of Trango Tower began on September 9, 1990. Takeyasu Minamiura, a thirty-three-year old Japanese climber, stood just under Trango's summit with his paraglider sail spread out on the snow behind him. He had just spent the past forty days soloing a new thirty-pitch A4 route on the east prow (Minamiura called his a ""capsule style"" ascent, but it is the closest to true alpine style that any first ascent on Trango has come), finishing the line that Wilford and I had started in 1989. As if pulling off one of the greatest big-wall solos of all time wasn't enough, he planned to cap his adventure with an airborne descent to the glacier, 2000 meters below.<p>After reaching the summit, he committed himself to the scheme with Samurai dedication, throwing off his haulbags, which were attached to a chute. Ominously, the gear flight went awry: his bags hit the cliff, then slid at warp speed down the gully to the Dunge Glacier. Low on food and with no ropes, Minamiura waited for a favorable wind for his takeoff. When a head-on breeze came around, he tugged on the riser cords of his rig. The canopy inflated.<p>But as soon as he stepped off the cliff, his chute collided with the wall. It deflated like a pricked balloon, sending him sliding down the south face of Trango Tower. Forty-five meters into his fall, the paraglider snagged on a rock horn, and Minamiura stopped. He hung at the end of a tangle of strings, wheezing from the impact, his feet dangling in space and his smashed eyeglasses bent around his face. The ice axe strapped to his back had prevented his spine from breaking.<p>He kept his cool, pulled out his radio and contacted his four Japanese friends, Masanori Hoshina, Satoshi Kimoto, Masahiro Kosaka and Takaaki Sasakura, who had just completed a twenty-four-day ascent of the Norwegian Buttress on Great Trango. Rather than asking them to rescue him, he told them he had had an accident and requested a helicopter.<p>The next morning, he disentangled himself from his parachute cords and traversed five meters to a narrow ledge. This place became his home for the next six days.<p>Minamiura's Mayday sent his friends scrambling. While two men went to look for him visually, Kimoto and Hoshina marched to a Pakistani army helipad at Payu, twelve miles away. On September 11, in a stripped-down Lama heli hot-rodded for high altitude, Kimoto and Hoshina flew to Trango Tower. The machine shook violently at 6000 meters, but they spotted Minamiura waving from his perch. Crosswinds prevented the pilot from landing or lowering a climber onto the narrow summit, and they radioed Minamiura that a heli rescue was impossible.<p>Instead, Kimoto and Hoshina embarked on a daring plan: they would be flown from the Dunge Glacier to the Trango Glacier, and from there climb the original British Route.<p>No one had repeated this route. When the Japanese started up it, they found canyon-like ice gullies and gaping chimneys festooned with ancient fixed rope. Fourteen years of ultraviolet degradation and stonefall had reduced the ropes to bootlace strength. Clasping ascenders to the tattered lines, they gingerly moved up. Often, they belayed each other on a separate rope and placed protection while jumaring the old cords. ""Yes, those ropes very dangerous,"" laughed Hoshina when I met him in 1994.<p>While the rescuers battled weathered ropes and waterfalls pouring down the Fissure Boysen, Minamiura waited. On September 12 a helicopter dropped food and first aid, but Minamiura couldn't catch the package. The nights of September 13 and 14 were cold and sleepless. Minamiura kept in radio contact with Takaaki Sasakura at base camp, talking about the meals they'd eat back in Japan. His thirst was becoming unbearable.<p>On September 15 the helicopter dropped more food, but it too disappeared. Then, on the radio, the pilot alerted Minamiura that a can of cheese had jammed in a flake fifteen feet above the ledge. Minamiura knew that if he left his bivy he might slip off, but he was starving and climbed to the flake on wobbly legs. He immediately found the cheese and ate it. It was his first food in six days.<p>On September 16 Hoshina and Kimoto rappelled to Minamiura, having blitzed the British Route in three days. The trio continued down by the Slovenian Route. By September 18 they were back on the Dunge Glacier. Minamiura had lived on Trango Tower for forty-nine days, the last twenty-two of them without a break.</i>",1291719522

Assuming I do so though I'm still seeking advice as to next steps.  I'm just going to dump some concerns/questions out there.<p>Starting with concerns, it's coded in TCL.  This presents several problems.  First TCL is disparaged.  Unfairly in my opinion, and not unlike how Javascript used to be disparaged.  The fact that I was able to slightly modify a couple of open source projects in Tcl (a web server and a web browser) and then glue them together with fewer than twenty lines of code for my prototype, speaks to its ability.<p>Notice I say its ability, definitely not mine: I've barely programmed in Tcl, and that is part of my problem: I don't have the necessary acumen.  And the disparagement means there's a dearth of Tcl talent.  I've actually gotten a couple of top Tcl developers (Jeff Hobbs, David Welton) to briefly entertain the idea and respond two or three times to emails from me, but those efforts have died on the vine.<p>Still though I am convinced of the viability of this project and indeed I have even prototyped what I consider to be a potential killer application with it: ebooks that support embedded Javascript.  Here is  a URL with a link to downloads for that prototype.<p>http://www.chess.com/download/view/stauntons-footsteps<p>I feel liked I've pushed this as far as I myself personally can and I guess I'm looking for advice or even assistance or a co-founder.  My interest is really in the front end aspects of it.  Also I have a number of first and second degree contacts with parties who have started up successful businesses around browser technology or epub-publishing.  My interest/skill is probably going to be around the front-end/middle-tier aspects of the project, I probably need more of a hardcore backend engineer with C chops (tkhtml3 the foundation of the hv3 browser that the project modifies, is written in C) who has Tcl experience or an interest.<p>Anyway thanks for any and all advice or hopefully interest in picking this up and running with it.  I'm trusting nobody will just fork this and run with it, plus don't forget, I've got some serious industry contacts already.  I think what this needs is some impetus and some polish and it will be ready to market more seriously.  Thanks for entertaining this rambling.",1291718432

1978595,comment,1977720,1978546,0,0,dkarl,,,"C is another Blub, so you aren't contradicting my point, but I would say that the reason C isn't a good replacement for Java is that C has no support for garbage collection.  C and Java both have a large amount of valuable, working code that programmers can utilize from other languages, but a language written on top of C has to accept that whenever a C library is used, someone must deal with C memory management, either the programmer who writes the bindings or every programmer who calls the bindings.  They may have to deallocate memory and they may have to reason about the lifetime of memory deallocated by library code.  Scala programmers can call Java code with no such worries.  If they wrap a Java API in a Scala API, it is only for style and convenience.  A Scala programmer would not use a C library lightly, certainly not without bindings that ensured memory safety, and writing such bindings would require a lot of care.<p>The difference in practice is obvious:  there is no Scala ""FFI"" to Java, at least not one that is visible to programmers.  You just instantiate Java objects and call their methods.  Ruby programmers do not blithely write calls directly to C functions in their Ruby code.  They look for bindings, write the bindings themselves if necessary (making sure the bindings handle all the C memory management safely,) and then call the bindings from their Ruby code.<p>Where increased performance is worth such an investment of time and care (and a little bit of unavoidable risk) it makes sense to build a language on top of C.  Java caters to a different set of needs, where convenience and safety trump performance.<p>P.S.  The Java community went through a phase back in the day when many libraries were wrappers around C libraries, for performance reasons or simply because there was no Java implementation available, and it was a big problem because it invalidated some of the guarantees that attracted people to Java in the first place.  Almost all (very, very close to all) of the cross-platform discrepancies encountered in server-side Java code were because the same C library behaved differently on different platforms.",1291716830

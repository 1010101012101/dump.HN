At an initial purchase price of ~$1800, that's a bargain. I use this thing all the time and have realized so much value from it.[<i>] <p>Compare this to my ""good suit"" which cost about $600, and has been worn a total of < 50 hours (job interviews, special occasions, etc).<p>Both are tools with a specific purpose but I get much more of a warm feeling using this computer, knowing that I bought a high quality tool and am using it to the fullest extent.<p>[</i>] This isn't a Mac vs PC comment - if you got a top quality ThinkPad or Vaio notebook and are using it daily, then you know what I mean.",1185973068

The limit doesn't seem to be in the algorithm (as this article makes clear), it's the ability of a 1 through 5 star system to accurately reflect a person's feelings about a movie.<p>While algorithms for predicting your upcoming ratings based on your previous ratings may not be able to improve...surely there are some creative ways to re-think the entire system:<p>Two obvious approaches would be to rate on multiple scales (funniness, intellectual weight, 'light'-ness, etc.), and to include a comment-tracking system alongside the simple rating system to provide a better more complex picture of the film (as Reddit, and YCnews do).",1185971380

It doesn't contain contact details like phone number, postal address, etc. It's all up in the air.<p>Seems like good old Nigerian emails scandal written all over it.",1185971337

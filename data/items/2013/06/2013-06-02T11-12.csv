5808178,comment,5807941,5807941,1,0,joshuahedlund,,,"One of the most challenging aspects of learning about important, under-reported events is correcting for the biases of individuals who are reporting on it<p>For example, while there are no doubt many shopping malls in Istanbul, I doubt there is ""at least one in every neighborhood!"" (unless that word is better translated as something more like a suburb)<p>This makes it harder to trust all of the details of the more serious accounts of police aggression, or the simplifed context of things like ""The whole country is being sold to corporations by the government"". As another commenter has pointed out, even photos can end up being from unrelated events.<p>This is not to say that this person's perspective is not extremely important, or that the Turkish state is not committing indefensible acts of aggression. It's just harder for outsiders to piece together a full and accurate picture of what is happening. Fortunately, multiple individual perspectives can help corroborate and enhance the picture to quite a degree.<p>Edit: Certainly media has biases too, although there are at least in theory standards for verifying reported facts, and the bias is (often) more about what they choose not report or what context is not given.<p>Edit: good points by buro as well. This account and others may well be very reliable, I'm more speaking from experience with past events that were reported in similar ways where key important facts turned out to be wrong or missing. (I know, that happens sometimes in traditional media too)",1370174238

Are there real objections within the company to the real name policy? Is it addressed by management?<p>Demanding better government is, of course, important. I spend a lot of time and money doing it - working with citizen lobbying groups, contacting my representatives and attending meetings.

If you don't mention salary, they presume (correctly) you're paying about the average. You don't have an opportunity to ""wow"" them.<p><i>if the harsh reality is that I must be paying more to devs, then how come there are so many devs (about 200) in this poll indicating they are getting under 50K? Why these two hundred people don't talk to me and many other companies desperate to hire developers on much better terms?</i><p>One potential reason: Fear of the unknown.<p>Someone in a job for 45K knows what the job is. They know what their co-workers are like, they know how stressful/relaxed it is. They know what their boss is like, they know what the commute is like. Your new job is a big unknown. It's risky. It might be just as good, or it might be crap, the boss might be an asshole, you might be working for a client from hell, it might be very stressful, the technology stack might be horrible.<p>If someone changes job to you, they are taking a risk. A 15K raise (45K  60K) is only about ~ 7K after taxes (right?), which is about 500 per month extra in their pocket. If they have a decent salary already, it might not be worth changing to a potentially crappy job for only that. However if you offer a large salary increase (100K), then suddenly the equation looks better, maybe that risk might pay off.<p>The ""risk pay off"" doesn't have to be salary. Why not offer 40 days annual leave, and a 4 day week for 60K. Again, reward the risk.

Domain names can have DNSSEC. DNS can even have keys for mail addresses (RFC 4398). So how hard would it really be to for mail relays to automatically retrieve a key and encrypt the email before sending it forward to its destination?",1370171575

External CSS almost never loaded, images certainly never did. For some sites it was a pain, but for most it was bearable. Often it was an improvement, using a default font at a decent size right to the edge of my browser window. Lovely.<p>Of course, my browser always <i>expected</i> the extra crap to come down the wire, so it waited forever before actually displaying anything. If I wanted to read something in any reasonable amount of time I had to wait until the HTML was downloaded (i.e., when the title bar said something nice) then disconnect from the internet. This made my browser say, ""Fuck it, let's try our best."" Hitting ""stop"" resulted in a blank page...<p>I know I'm not the typical audience, but for me browsing with wget would have been a better experience.",1370171461
5808060,comment,5807770,5808048,4,0,davewiner,,,"Those are great questions, and I've wondered about it myself.<p>In movies for example, teams form for projects that last in total a couple of years, but for individuals, their work might just be a couple of months. I've often wished programming worked like that, at least commercial projects. I know a lot of programmers I'd like to try working with. But we don't do it that way.<p>Also, there is a sense of history in most of those activities that isn't present here. A young basketball player can tell you about all his role models, going back many generations. I've seen it (thinking of Iman Schumpert on the Knicks).<p>They listen to each others' music, eat each others' food, I'm sure there's a lot of pettiness to the discourse, but in software, it's not uncommon for people to compete with products they've never even tried. I can see that in competitive products!<p>I think it will eventually get better. It is getting better over time. When I was starting the idea of an individual creating software was VERY radical, and there wasn't much support for it. Until I came to Calif, and met other people who believed in the idea. Nowadays, they make movies about people doing that. I would have told you 30 years ago that day would come, and people really didn't believe it. Esp programmers. :-)<p>So it is getting better. I just wish it would get there faster.",1370171444

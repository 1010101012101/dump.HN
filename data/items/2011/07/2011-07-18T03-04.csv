2775056,comment,2773514,2774952,2,0,Alex3917,,,"""Does this passage strike anyone else as over stating LSD's impact?""<p>It's necessarily true, but it's not a stretch either. LSD was arguably the key driver behind the creation of the Internet, silicon valley, the environmental movement, the civil rights movement, etc. It was also the reason why psychiatry adopted the position that mental illnesses were caused by chemical imbalances in the brain.<p>""I think the social revolution of the 60s allowed LSD and the culture it created to flourish and not the other way round as seems to be being argued here.""<p>So I think the key to understanding the 60s, the hippies, and LSD is the atomic bomb. Nick Sand and many of the other high level manufacturers and distributors of LSD were the children of high level figures in the manhattan project. Nick Sand's dad was one of the key chemists that developed the bomb. And supposedly the dad of one of the other key acid manufacturers was the co-pilot of the Enola Gray, one of the planes that dropped the atomic bomb on Japan.<p>Most of the energy (and bullshit) behind the counterculture in general was a reaction against atomic energy and the culture of the 50s. Clearly the angst would have been there without LSD, but I think that acid became sort of the banner that everyone rallied behind and that united everyone. This is especially true since it's such a prosocial drug; one of its main effects is that it basically makes you care more about other people. (And engage with and collaborate with them, as the case may be.)<p>Of course the reason it became such a part of the culture is that it fundamentally changed a lot of people, especially a lot of people who later went on to contribute enormous amounts to society, on a deeply personal level. You can already read a lot about this and you'll be able to read increasingly more about as that generation gets older and starts retiring and writing memoirs. In general the ways that any drug impacts culture are really subtle, but definitely there.

He said that in 2 years, he learned exactly one thing that he wouldn't have figured out on his own with a little thought. (It was the law of comparative advantage, which blew my mind as well.) The rest was building a rolodex and gaining skill in presenting smoothly.<p>His experience made me pretty suspicious of the intellectual content business schools. Given that, cheating makes a twisted sort of sense. And of course, if one plans to go on to create mortgage-backed securities or asset-stripping leveraged buyouts, one probably has an ends-justify-the-means attitude by the time graduate school rolls around.",1310961545

The British cabinet committee had originally proposed a 3-tier federation: with the center at the top, a provincial grouping of states in the middle, and states at the bottom. There were 3 'groups': A: Hindu-majority areas of the North, West and South B: Muslim-majority areas of the North-West, C: Bengal and Assam. Jinnah and the communists had agreed to this plan, Nehru wanted to defer the decision to the Constituent Assembly. Jinnah saw this as a 'betrayal' and withdrew his support. Eventually, when this plan seemed in jeopardy, the cabinet committee proposed Partition. Jinnah accepted, Nehru disagreed. And then 'Direct Action Day' and riots happened.

Brides sometimes come from Vietnam, where the girls outnumber boys and the culture is somewhat similar; also men occasionally marry African women, as China is now doing more business there; though there's a hell of a lot of racism in China towards anyone with darker skin than average. Also, men are expected to buy a house and car before marriage, which isn't great for men from poorer families (the boys parents usually foot the bill, as few men in their 20s can buy a house). Actually, the costs of male children is starting to reduce the prejudice a bit.<p>It will raise the crime rate, and cause social disorder (young unmarried men are the kind of people who throw molotov cocktails at authorities - and no authority wants that). China knows this, and has softened the one-child policy a lot. Women used to be forced to abort subsequent pregnancies; now they are more likely to face a fine.

Neither are tenured.<p>Both of them have had serious issues with student cheating.  The one at the state college got support from one of her superiors, and was not penalized for fighting plagiarism, but it was still very time consuming.  Another one of her superiors (in previous years) did not support her in any way, and she had to cut back on enforcing academic honesty to help protect her job, save for the most blatant cases.<p>The other one (at the for-profit college) stopped crusading against cheating when she found out that she'd (effectively) be fired if she continued.  Pass rates are a sizable portion of what's used to determine which teachers are given which classes.  In one class, more than half of her students should have been failed for academic honesty violations by the halfway point of the year.  However, if she did that, her pass rates would have been low enough that it was extremely likely that she would not be given any classes next semester.  (Not technically fired, but functionally so.)<p>So, you are not the only person encountering this, and you're not alone in realizing that fighting cheating can be hazardous to your career.

You can't just leave a citation behind and let the students and administration handle it.  The professor will be involved.<p>There's also the aspect of a student being falsely accused of cheating.  I was unfortunate enough to have experienced this during my college career.  A fellow student, whom I didn't know outside of class, copied my answers exactly on a German exam.  I don't know why he did this, because there were only 15 students in the class and the professor knew us all fairly well.  To think the professor wasn't going to notice was a stupid assumption on his part.<p>I was called in to her office and shown the two tests.  The answers were the same down to the punctuation even.  It was clear the other guy was very bad at cheating and probably did it out of desperation.  I was initially shocked and feared I was going to fail the class despite my innocence.  She had to refer the incident to the honor board due to university policy.  When I left her office I was so furious that I looked up where the other student lived because I wanted to fight him.  But I took a walk, cooled off and decided against it.<p>I was ultimately cleared by the board and there were no marks on my record.  After the proceedings were over, the professor apologized to me and said that she never believed for a moment that I had cheated, or that I had helped him cheat.  She pleaded with dean to avoid sending the matter to the honor board, but she had to follow policy.<p>She said she never had any cheating incidents in the past, and that it was personally distressing for her to handle the situation.  It was definitely stressful for me as well.",1310960196

2774993,comment,2774254,2774254,3,0,WorkInKarlsruhe,,,"It is interesting that so many people think that Panos should have taken a hard line.  Panos seems to have had few options (and I applaud the approach he ultimately chose for the reasons he gave), but that is only if you constrain yourself to the current system, which is grade based.  Removing the grades from the system is an option, but few consider it, and there is much evidence from the people that have stopped using grades that it nets great results.  My PhD experience, since it inherently was not graded, was a data point for myself --- everyday was a day of glory, pursuing my passions; and I could dive deeper into what a professor said, or ignore other things that I wasn't yet ready to hear, without a second thought about earning a grade.  I learned a ton, more than at any period of my earlier life (now I learn, as in gaining understanding, more per day than during my PhD), and I attended some ""good"" schools.  Using grades has poor psychological side effects, one of which is to groom people for employment, as opposed to preparing them to start companies; another is to drive self consciousness and fear of mistakes (which are horrible side effects to have associated with learning); competitiveness; and focus on pleasing others to the extent of deceiving them.  I think many people in their 30s or 40s realize what a waste of life those years of earning grades was (but won't admit it) --- now they probably use the skills gained from passing tests more than they use the knowledge that they accumulated.",1310959780

Make your warning at the start of the semester, and to everybody: any reasonable suspicion of cheating results in an immediate referral to the honor board, no protesting or second chances.  The first assignment rolls around, a few people are caught cheating, and you spend X hours submitting their cases to the honor board.  Let the honor board handle the adjucation of the matter, which is where it belongs, and wastes less of your time.  It also lets the department know that they have a problem, since some of them are probably involved with the honor board.<p>Students hear that peers are getting sent straight to the honor board, and they fall in line.  The next assignment that rolls around, almost surely less students will attempt to cheat.  If you have to spend Y hours sending more students to the honor board, hopefully Y is less than X.  But it sends a loud-and-clear, unmistakable message to the students that cheating is unacceptable.  With any luck the students that actually take the class seriously will appreciate your candor on the matter.<p>I agree that allowing students to actually come in and argue their case to you is a waste of your time.  You're right, that's not your job.  Send it to the honor board and waste the time of the deans and the department heads, since that's their job.  If you let students waste your time by giving them an extra strike before they're out, you can't be surprised when they try to take advantage of it.  One strike and you're out tells students that it doesn't matter if <i>ex post facto</i> you think your best friend's grandma's death drove you to do it: cheating is never acceptable.",1310959764

2774959,comment,2774254,2774254,187,0,nyustern,,,"Hi Panos. I was actually a student in your class last fall semester. To alleviate any doubt you may have, the class was known as Info Tech, and you had two sessions on Mondays and Wednesdays (2-3:15, 3:30-4:45 pm) in KMEC.<p>Now I have a couple of problems with your post. Firstly, you attribute your lower evaluation rating of 5.3 for last fall semester solely to your lower tolerance of cheating. However, there is something very wrong with this logic. As you may (or evidently, may not) know, correlation does not imply causation. In other words, your lower overall rating was not necessarily due to your increased surveillance of plagiarism; it could have been due to other factors. As someone who was a student in your class, I can speak for myself and say that I did give you a low rating, and it was NOT because you punished the cheatersit was far from it. To put it rather simply and bluntly, you were unkind (thats an extreme euphemism) out of the classroom. Sure, you had your favorites (my best friend being one of them) as most professors do. However, you had, what I perceived to be, an irrational disdain for some of your students, I being one of them. When I asked questions in class, youd quietly giggle or give me a blank stare as if the question I asked was completely stupid (forgive me, Im not technologically inclined), which of course discouraged me from participating in class. When I stayed after class to ask you questions I was too shy to ask in class, or to just discuss the subject material in greater depth, youd answer in a very short, annoyed tone, as if you had more important things to do. My thank yous went unanswered. My smiles to you were not reciprocated. Sure, it sounds silly, but it was very clear you did not like me. And I had no idea why. Some people noticed, while others in the class also felt like you hated them for no apparent reason. It got to the point where we, as well as others who experienced better treatment, discussed it and concluded you were just racist. Now, I know you and many others reading this post probably think Im just a pissed off student who didnt get the grade he wanted and is now bashing his teacher out of revenge. However, thats really not the case; I just figured Id give you my honest opinion of you seeing as your perception of your students mentality towards you is completely mistaken. Ill just quickly recount one experience that perfectly illustrates my overall experience with you.  For the WiMax assignment (which is what your blog post is based on), after all the students had received your email demanding those who plagiarized to come in to talk to you, naturally everyone, even those who didnt cheat, felt very uneasy and worried. I, who collaborated with a friend on one small part of the assignment, got worried and came in to see you during office hours. When I arrived, there was one other student waiting in the seating area; she said you werent in your office. So we waited for a good 30 minutes until you came strolling in. She then went in to speak with you. About 20 minutes passed until she emerged. You then walked out, saw me, and then said Ill be back soon. 50 MINUTES ELAPSED, and you finally returned. You were munching on a sandwich. As you walked by me, you mumbled emergency. So, almost two hours after I had come to your office, I finally was able to speak with you. We went in, you looked up my assignment, and then you said theres no problem with your assignment; youre fine. So I left. There was no apology.<p>Now, aside from me having a bad experience with you, what really irks me about your post is your complacence with cheating because its not in your self-interest to pursue those who cheated. A true capitalist at heart, I guess. As a student who did not cheat, worked very hard, and still received a relatively low grade in your class, theres nothing more infuriating. Is it not your job as an educator to make sure those who put in the most effort and demonstrate the highest level of achievement are awarded grades accordingly? Is it not your job to make sure the playing field is level, especially at a school where there is such a high pressure to do well as a result of a strict grading curve policy?  I guess you dont believe so. I mean, after all, you did give my friend, who consistently received a B average on assignments and exams throughout the semester, an overall grade of A (which he was very, very shocked by).<p>Anyway, that is not to say I did not learn a lot from your class. You were a great teacher inside the classroom. However, teaching evaluations dont just measure your ability to give good lectures; they are holistic--meaning, they also measure intangibles, such as the professor's willingness to help students, or his attitude. And that, Panos, is where you failed.",1310958862

If you have a better handle on how many candidates will be there, space can be allocated much more efficiently. I was surprised to see how little space I was supposed to get, and even more surprised when I was the only candidate (out of 6) at my table.<p>A deposit also helps you accept more candidates, which decreases the load on those of us that show up. I saw two companies that I <i>really</i> wanted to speak with (Mozilla and Yammer) seemingly lose interest because my line was too long. By the time I had a spare moment, they were gone. I might apply through normal channels, but I might not.<p>Here are a couple of suggestions:<p>-Make the name tags for recruiters and candidates different colors, if you can do so without completely losing legibility.<p>-Tell the candidates about the technical/non-technical dots (I may have missed the memo; if so, no worries). Either way, this was a great idea.<p>-Tell Garrett to get some sleep!<p>Personally, I had a blast. I came from Long Island, NY for the event, and it was more than worth it. I got swamped with interest and I'm literally sitting here juggling interview requests as I type this. I originally planned to leave Sunday morning (silly me), but my stay has been extended until late this week.<p>For future candidates:<p>-If the recruiter gives you something that doesn't have their name on it (like a printed job posting), get their contact information and write it down. You will never remember it later, and you want to be able to refer to that individual in your future correspondence.<p>-Preparation is pretty crucial. My experience was much less stressful because I worked on my stuff (poster, projects and their elevator pitches) for tens of hours. To that end...<p>-Do not stay up late the previous night hacking on your project. I know of one candidate who didn't attend because she stayed up all night working on a demo, and was then too tired to show up. The fair itself is actually draining; you stand up for hours on end and talk constantly. You don't want to start the day tired. I got an absurd amount of sleep (10+ hours) and was still beat by dinner.<p>-Test your demos beforehand on the laptop/server(s) that you plan to use.<p>-Print lots of resums <i>before</i> you get to the fair. I printed 32 (power of 2, hee hee) and had to tell about 10 people that I ran out. Printer availability at the Dojo is spotty. Also, put your GitHub URL on your resum. Not sure why I forgot to do this. My (printed) resum is in Markdown, and this earned me brownie points. Also print it on heavier (but not too heavy) paper, too. 24lb. maybe? I'll stop rambling about resums now, they're boring.<p>-Make a cool poster. I had a neat poster, and it ended up being a conversation starter. The posters exist so recruiters can size you up while you're talking to someone else. Why not make a good first impression?<p>-Brush up on your knowledge before the fair itself, as you may have a technical interview (or two, or ten) <i>that day.</i><p>-If you're coming from out of town, find Katy on Airbnb. She is awesome.<p>For future recruiters:<p>-Do not walk up to candidates and ask them to describe themselves without first introducing yourself and your organization. I did a lot of unnecessary talking...<p>This turned out to be a lot longer than I expected, so I'll probably turn this into a blog post once the dust settles.<p>Bottom line, you guys did a hell of a job!

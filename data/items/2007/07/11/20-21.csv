33725,comment,33723,33723,0,0,danw,,,"I mentioned this to a friend of mine the other day and she simply said ""What ads on facebook?"". She not a techie, doesn't use an ad blocker and logs into facebook daily. We're all used to these ads and don't even see them anymore, in much the same way we all channel surf or go to make a cup of tea during TV ad breaks.<p>Perhaps we need a new way of delivering ads in communication apps that differs from information & entertainment apps. Twitter, facebook, blyk and many other face this same problem with monetisation. Whats the solution? Is it ok to analyse what people are saying to each other and deliver text link ads inline with the conversation. If I say ""Want to go for a drink later?"" to a friend on facebook should there be a link underneath saying ""Get half price drinks a Bob's Bar""?<p>Any ideas?",1184184954

I do put some of the information from LinkedIn on Facebook (they do have a Work & Education section in profiles), but that's not why people look at my profile. <p>I certainly wouldn't want the comments on my wall showing up when people are analyzing my profile as a job candidate.<p>The two services just don't mesh very well on a high level.",1184184729

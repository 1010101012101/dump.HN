If you are going to write a form letter — \n&quot;Dear Sir or Madam&quot; — \nthen, yes, you don&#x27;t want a font that makes things look personal, like Comic Sans. Also &quot;this note looks like it was written by a 12 year old&quot;? Have you seen the handwriting of a 12 year old?<p>That is, perhaps, a good indication of the disconnect between how professionals trained in graphic design perceive something and how the vast majority of the public perceive it. Most people wish their handwriting looked as neat and legible as Comic Sans. It doesn&#x27;t look like it was written by a twelve year old, it looks like <i>unprofessional</i>. Which is why people like it.<p>Many people, when they see something they wrote in a standard computer font, think that it looks wrong. It doesn&#x27;t look like their words any more, it looks too cold, formal, impersonal, professional, machine-like. They don&#x27;t want their words to look like something that has been reviewed by a series of editors, run by the legal department and then sent to the team of graphics artists for final layout.<p>Comic Sans looks warm, friendly, human, and informal.<p>Everything you list as aesthetic defects are exactly the characteristics that make Comic Sans successful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://kinkeaddesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Comic-Sans-Probs.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kinkeaddesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Comic-S...</a>",1410094327

8280979,comment,8280457,8280890,1,0,mythz,,,"> Stop making up stuff. I never said GC is in the language specification; instead was responding _specifically_ to your own statement about C# being supported well by the Mono runtime.<p>Sorry you&#x27;ve got it backwards, you&#x27;re the one who introduced the .NET Framework vs Mono and their differing GC implementations as a valid comparisons for Dart (which they&#x27;re not):<p>> C# is an ECMA standard too; how well did Mono fare in the early days and even now after more than ten years?<p>I&#x27;ve just corrected you in both cases that the Mono compiler has excellent support for the (C#) language specification which it does, valid C# both compiles with the Mono C# compiler and runs on the Mono VM fine. The language specification was what made this possible. The issues that you cite in the early days have no basis for comparison with Dart, which are instead side-effects from re-implementing a closed implementation like ActiveX (another incorrect comparison) should anyone else had chosen to re-implement it.<p>The fact is the Dart platform couldn&#x27;t be any more open than it is already: it&#x27;s completely open source, has a language specification, has multiple compliant open source implementations (Dart VM + Dart2JS), has open patent grants, develops in the open, accepts external contributions, features are prioritized and driven by user feedback, encourages re-use and adoption.<p>The Mono team were instead forced to create the VM and compiler from scratch and had to re-implement and reverse-engineer .NET&#x27;s vast class libraries and API&#x27;s (which don&#x27;t have specs), precisely because they&#x27;re not able to re-use the existing implementation. The Mono team are actually very happy whenever Microsoft releases some of their .NET libraries as Open source which they&#x27;ve been able to re-use as-is. Thus none of the issues you&#x27;ve brought up applies to Dart which is entirely Open Source that both supports and encourages embedding and re-use.<p>Instead of Mono and ActiveX, the JVM and open source OpenJDK implementation or examples of embedding V8 like node would&#x27;ve been better comparisons.<p>> Our positions are very clear here, and we disagree. That&#x27;s fine.<p>Whilst I disagree with your invalid comparisons, I&#x27;m ok with the rest of your comments in which you&#x27;re only stating your opinions and beliefs. In contrast, I believe innovations like Dart are going to help move the web forward and enable richer experiences and already improves the development of large web apps .",1410094267

I don&#x27;t mean to call thermodynamics awesome because it powers cars or because it&#x27;s a well research field.<p>Trying to understand how the brain works or making a computer that works in a similar way is awesome to me. If there are still computational limitations that makes it not practical, that&#x27;s still an awesomely interesting subject.",1410091316

8280875,comment,8278716,8280499,2,0,VLM,,,"One problem with that reg is its a 1A reg.  There is a pin compatible LM323T which is rated to 3 amps and is only about a buck and a half.  Its not just fatter bonding wires and wider traces on the die, the thermal resistance from junction to package is ridiculously lower... how&#x27;d they do that?  Obviously I know the theory of how to do that, but how&#x27;d they do it electrically pin compatible.  Its like someone introducing in 2014 a ford model T that is blueprint compatible with every other model T except this one has 500 horsepower, somehow.  I&#x27;m professionally semi-impressed by the 323T product.<p>There is a huge problem in the marketplace right now with LM323K series regs (basically a 3 amp die in a TO3 &quot;big transistor&quot; mounting case).  The problem is old video game systems (not home systems, but video arcade) and some other old appliances use them, so you could modify the heatsink and stick a modern LM323T (aka TO-220 package) or hot wire in a COTS switching supply, but it wouldn&#x27;t look &quot;stock&quot; anymore.  So the market is getting flooded.<p>Its &quot;well known&quot; among CPU collectors that when you get a (insert obscure CPU here) from China, you&#x27;re not really getting that CPU, you&#x27;re getting some random 40 pin DIP with repainted markings.  The only honest and reputable seller I&#x27;m personally aware of in China who doesn&#x27;t do this is utsource, the stuff they ship actually works.<p>Its bad when they take a random chip like a 16550 or 8255 and remark it as a Z80 or 8086 for the collectors, but its actually worse when you really do need a 10 MHz rated Z80 or 6502 and you&#x27;re sold a remarked 2 MHz part which kinda sorta sometimes works.  Or if you want a real PITA some of the repainters are fairly ignorant and will ship repainted 6809 for 6809E and vice versa.  Or another hilarious one, not all 6502 are pin compatible so you get a WDC product repainted to be sold as a rockwell product, which again doesn&#x27;t work a lot of the time.<p>No, ebay in 2014 is not really fun at all for a retrocomputing enthusiast or whatever you call it.<p>I guess the closest HN sports analogy would be ebay is flooded with collectors items claiming to be the 1790 world series collectors plate or the 1925 football superbowl.<p>If you&#x27;re just trying to regulate 600 mA for your rasp pi or whatever its no big deal but its a hassle for repair/restoration of old equipment.",1410091256

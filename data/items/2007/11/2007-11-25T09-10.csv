Many people program in language X because they like language X, and that doesn't apply just to Ruby. ""I program in Ruby because it makes me feel good"" is an empty statement.<p>Did you program in other languages? Did they also make you feel good? Why/why not? Do you think languages in which you haven't programmed could make you feel even better than Ruby?<p>I hope most people who program in Ruby have better reasons than ""it makes me feel good."" If they didn't, I wouldn't feel good programming in Ruby.",1195983414

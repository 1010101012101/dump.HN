It&#x27;s hard to see how they would not be the same thing, but at the same time I think there is an argument to be made that there have been times that Sony have done things that decreased consumer happiness (e.g. removing the ability to install Linux on the PS3) which did not have a particularly adverse effect on their market share (how many people actually stopped using PS3 or decided not to buy one when Sony made this decision?  I do not actually know the answer, so my argument might be way off base, but I had the impression that it was some insignificantly small number).",1371174379

LabView by design is fully parallel, which is exactly what you want in this case: it&#x27;s like having 1000s of small, independent CPUs. With VHDL it took an order of magnitude more time to achieve the same.
Also it was easy with LV to tweak the low level details until everything fits in the 3M or so gates available.<p>Other use case would be when the customers of your app are only engineers who know LabView. They (might) accept the limitations in exchange of quick tweaking here or there.<p>For anything else I would avoid LV. Larger projects are very hard to maintain, the declarative programming will scare most of the developers away and I could not find any advantage over mainstream programming languages.",1371173679

Have you ever seen the accounting systems in a modern corporation? It can get highly technical and complicated.<p>Courts have experts to explain to them the legally significant aspects of different issues, and it works reasonably well.<p>In my experience, courts, at least federal appellate courts and the Supreme Court, don&#x27;t usually get decisions wrong because they don&#x27;t understand the problem domain. Instead, courts don&#x27;t share the value systems of people within those fields. And that irritates practitioners on philosophical grounds.<p>Consider internet technology.

The game is still supposed to be $60 at launch, that&#x27;s when games make the most money, they really are worth that much (and more) as evidenced by the many people who pay that much for them, even on DRM-laden platforms like Steam.<p>The point is to let the price fall faster after launch. Xbox can&#x27;t exactly promise &quot;Our games&#x27; prices will fall faster than the other guys&quot; because the market will determine that -- in aggregate they will, but there&#x27;s a reason Skyrim is still $30 on Steam.<p>Microsoft wants a world where you have account-locked games tied to disks, because it gives them the benefits of Steam-like DRM but also the game conveniently on a disk to take to a friend&#x27;s so he doesn&#x27;t have to download it, and to let the poor schmuck in rural Nebraska with 25 kb/s to play the game some time in the next week.<p>Honestly, Sony can take the same pricing strategies as Microsoft on their digital downloads -- Microsoft just wants to have more convenient digital downloads, while Sony just wants more convenient disks.<p>My guess is that long-term Microsoft will prove to be on the right side of history (the success of Steam is evidence). Sony can probably do just fine for now, they can always transition in later generations when the downsides are no longer breaking news stories.",1371171688

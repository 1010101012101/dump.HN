But in the meantime they cost money, don't affect sales one bit, and you likely won't get them until years after it is obvious whether you've succeeded or failed as a business.<p>Until the big boys decide that the cost of patent trolls exceeds the benefit of their patent moats, nothing will change about patent law.  In particular I see no sign that the next 24 months is critical.  In fact I'm willing to bet you money on that.  The next 24 months is mostly going to be spent with a Republican Congress (who see patents as ""business friendly"" and have bigger political fish to fry) fighting with Obama.  After that we'll have a new administration, which is going to focus on top political stuff for their first 100 days.<p>My personal suspicion is that the economy is going to go south again, credit problems are coming back in a big way, and financial/economic issues are going to keep software patents off of the list of priorities for a long time.",1311036893

It was fairly common for users to set up triggers that detect particular patterns of text that represented structured information and then initiating an action based upon them.<p>Here's Apple description of what the patent in question is:<p>""The '647 patent generally relates to a computer-based system and method for detecting structures and performing computer-based actions on the detected structures. In particular, this invention recognizes that computer data may contain structures, for example, phone numbers, post-office addresses, and dates, and performs related actions with that data. The '647 patent accomplishes this by identifying the structure, associating candidate actions to the structures, enabling selections of an action, and automatically performing the selected action on the structure. For instance, the system may receive data that includes a phone number, highlight it for a user, and then, in response to a user's interaction with the highlighted text, offer the user the choice of making a phone call to the number.""<p>Anyone who's read the patent in detail care to comment if they think MUD clients would be sufficient prior-art to invalidate it ?",1311036311

The main advantages of Django are - lots of libraries, and the generic views. But I personally dislike generic views. They just feel a little like magic, and a little over-engineered. They might be good for larger projects, but using them from the start feels like premature overengineering.<p>I like Tornado. In the overview (<a href=""http://www.tornadoweb.org/documentation/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tornadoweb.org/documentation/overview.html</a>), it gives you - auth (using OpenID), secure cookies, XSRF protection, templates, localization, UI modules (really basic, compared to generic views), running in prodution with Nginx, and aync programming. It doesn't have much database stuff (just a wrapper around MySQL), but you can use SQLAlchemy, or some other ORM.<p>Only the auth stuff feels over-engineered, because it uses async programming to call a general interface for Facebook OAuth, OpenID, Twitter OAuth, and so it's a bit of a dog's breakfast.",1311034865

I always <i>listen politely</i> to advice offered by people who are not teachers. I listen especially carefully to my students of course as that is a critical part of teaching.<p>Activities similar to the ones that you have suggested here are used quite often in Further Education colleges in the UK. There is a general emphasis on 'active learning'.

Then, when the time comes, they send a very short command which tells you which blocks to use and how to reconstruct the model.  Hmm... but now I'm thinking about it, I think you'd need a large overhead in both directions to make it difficult to just match the patterns of which blocks you used.",1322908374

3307443,comment,3304847,3306537,9,0,sjwright,,,"> I don't really understand why git users keep repeating this trope.<p>You can create a branch in Git without having to touch the main repository. It's a lot cheaper <i>mentally</i> to create a local branch than a globally viewable one. In particular, it's a lot cheaper to create a branch when you don't have to think about whether the work is important enough to deserve one, or if your crazy idea might end up being an embarrassing failure. When a decision only affects yourself, it's a lot easier to be bold.<p>> SVN has merge tracking, so it Just Works:<p>SVN can branch easily, and it <i>remembers how a merge went down,</i> but it doesn't know how to merge a branch back into the truck when the truck has since progressed. When SVN merges, it doesn't know if a difference between the two branches is because it was changed on the trunk or on the branch. It just sees a difference.<p>Git can replay the changes made in the branch on the updated trunk, or vice versa.",1322907426

These companies can, for different prices, do everything from design a tablet PC off a single phone call to simply building something exactly to your CAD drawings.<p>This is why all computers (Dells, HPs, etc, not sure what Apple does) are manufactured by a handful of companies (Solectron, Flextronics) which actually run the Chinese factories.",1239353501
555862,comment,555782,555782,0,0,schammy,,,"Yeah so he reduced the number of database rows from 3M to 1.4M. But you shouldn't be using a normal database for this type of query anyways - it's SLOW, because you're doing a range search. Maxmind also offers a binary database that is extremely fast, even with just a PHP script that they provide that parses through it - and I guarantee you this is at least 10 times as fast as doing it with MySQL. And if you install their Apache module, which is not hard (although you do need root access on the machine), it's something like 20x to 30x faster.<p>Not to put down this person's/people's work, but don't do IP geolocation with MySQL if performance is of any importance to you. Use the binary database that Maxmind provides and you can get much better performance with almost no extra effort.",1239353331
555861,comment,555627,555729,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Another thing you're not taking into account is that on modern CPUs, execution units that aren't being used are put in low-power states. So in the simplest case, pure integer code uses less power than integer/floating-point code, and a core doing nothing at all goes into ""deep sleep"".<p>A practical consequence of this appears on a modern Core2 laptop, if you have a computational task of fixed size and let it run, once with speedstep locked to the lowest level and once with dynamic clocks. Obviously the dynamically clocked one will finish more quickly and sit idle after that. If you let it sit idle until the low-clocked one has finished, you'll find the low-clocked one will have consumed more total energy. This means that for occasional-load scenarios, the dynamic clocking gives longer battery life, and for heavy load it gives shorter waits.<p>Spreading does make sense even in this light of course, as things like shared caches, memory and bus controllers need to run as soon as at least one core is active.",1239353294

555856,comment,554611,554611,0,0,koningrobot,,,"I see the point, but I disagree that it's a problem that needs to be solved.  What is the alternative?  A ""Numbers"" class?  And how would this look in syntax?  Numbers.new([ 0, 1, 2, 3 ])?  I mean, I'm sure you could make it a special case, but it really isn't a special case.  Type inference won't cut it, and having to specify everything explicitly is tedious (and a matter of where you draw the line).<p>And what would you get if you mapped over a Numbers object?  An Array or another Numbers object?  Looks like you'll have to specify the return type for the block.  Even then, is an array of numbers really always a Numbers object?<p>I suppose that in this case, you could use a Numbers module and (somehow) make every array of numbers magically inherit this.  But a generic, extensible way of doing this would be really, really complex and hard to do efficiently.  Does every newly created collection have to be checked for Numbers-ness?<p>Really, you can go as wild as you want to, but I'd rather just be able to map, transpose and flatten around without all of this bureaucracy.  Besides that, I'm fairly certain this is only a problem in single-dispatch languages where methods are owned by classes.",1239352708

5727065,comment,5723954,5724512,1,0,talmand,,,">> societal expectation of 'fair share'<p>Societal expectations have little bearing on a badly written law. Society can expect anything it wants, but if the laws don't reflect those expectations then society will forever be disappointed. I stipulate that current tax laws do not meet societal expectations and blaming the companies for it is misguided and wasteful. The blame should be aimed at the people who write the tax laws that do not meet societal expectations.<p>>> they're paying the legal minimum they can get away with under the tax code<p>Another way to look at that is they're paying the maximum they are required to pay under the tax code.<p>>> paying what the society they operate within intended when the laws were drawn up<p>If they are paying the legally required amount then they are indeed paying what is required. If the intention was for them to pay more then that indicates an issue with the tax law, not the practices of the company. If said company finds a way to reduce their tax liability within the law then they are doing nothing wrong. Your language implies they are doing something wrong; be it unethical or illegal. They are not, they are doing what is required by law. If people feel that's not enough then the tax laws need to be reviewed. It is not a company's responsibility to fund society more than what the law says it is required to do. You are implying that companies do have that responsibility based upon the whims of society despite the law.<p>>> Paying your 'fair share' would mean playing by the intended rules and the spirit of the laws, not seeing what you can get away with.<p>Again, you are implying they are doing something wrong. If they are breaking the law then that's one thing; if they follow the tax laws then they are not ""seeing what they can get away with"", they are paying what is required of them. If a tax law is written with a certain intention with an expected ""spirit"" but the tax law doesn't actually reflect that, then the fault is on the people who wrote the law not the one's who follow it.<p>>> politicians ought to be doing something about this ... it's clear that many actors in society are not really acting in good faith<p>You start out fine, but yet again, if the company is following the tax law so that they are not breaking the law, then they are acting in good faith. I fail to see how following the law, despite how complicated and stupid it is, is acting in bad faith.",1368830912

If nothing is signed, essentially everything has full permissions, so we'll ignore that part for now, and just look at the differences once malware is signed.<p>First and foremost, it cost $100 to get the signature.  It was paid somehow.  Hello money trail, this is way more information on malware authors / pushers than we tend to get.  If they somehow obfuscated every bit of data in that account to the point that it's worthless, then it's merely identical to it lacking a signature, no worse.<p>Second, it can be revoked.  This <i>severely</i> limits the spread, reducing the total damage.  Sure, the people prior to this are impacted, but they would be if it didn't have a signature, so again, no worse, no matter what.<p>Third, people click 'yeah, let this program do whatever the hell it wants' all the time, so the <i>lack</i> of a signature really doesn't prevent its spread / limit the damage.

And as I replied below, experts and novices have very different needs in terms of their information behavior.<p>I still don't think that lets Google off the hook, though; it just makes it more important that their personalization strategy be backed by very flexible, granular, and technically meaningful privacy controls. It means that Google should be setting an even higher bar in terms of educating their users about precisely what data gets collected and exactly how it gets used- and they should empower their users to control how that personal data impacts their experience using Google's products.<p>The number of their users who actually care about this stuff right now is basically a rounding error when compared to their total user numbers, but that doesn't mean it isn't important.

Resolution and dynamic range of VR still lag the real world by an order of magnitude. Latency is extremely touchy for scenes of any complexity, especially given hardware that is designed to be wearable. Even if these issues only manifest subconsciously, the differences add up: the human eye has ~100megapixel resolution and hardwired motion tracking so detailed that the information has to be lossfully compressed 100:1 before being shipped across the optic nerve (the first level of feature extraction happens <i>in</i> your eye). Those compression ""algorithms"" suffer under VR.<p>People will probably be willing to put up with the quality drop to play games because games are viscerally engaging in a way that allows you to push through sensory obstacles. Workplaces, however, lack that energy and are subject to the constraint of productivity, which I think will make them much harder to penetrate with VR: tiny psychological stresses quickly become intolerable if you're already frustrated by dependency management / tedious busywork / whatever, while the virtual world doesn't actually allow you to do all that much that you couldn't do before. Pro apps will probably take 5-10 years to adjust in a meaningful way, and I doubt that more than a handful of industries will actually be revolutionized by the difference.<p>In the meantime, AR dramatically helps the smoothness problem while still enabling almost all of the gee-whiz features of VR that would have relevance in a professional setting. Military applications are the obvious exception (full VR potentially offers protection from lasers/irritants/bullets to the face) but even military funding won't be enough to close the gap between VR and AR instantaneously.<p>In the long term, you're right, VR will win, but given that the ""short term"" will probably last for decades, I think you're jumping the gun on VR.",1368830320

I do not want to be some progressive nice guy's feel-good story, I want to be good at what I do.  So while I do appreciate this enthusiasm for helping women succeed in tech, I respectfully would ask that the best way to help is to mentor, teach, and advise -- not to make us feel like we've become someone's pet diversity project.  I mean, I want to be a great coder someday, not a great woman coder, y'know?<p>In short: help us tap into resources and conferences and classes and seminars where we can hone our skills, and we can take it from there.  (Etsy's recent program to develop more female engineers is probably the gold standard to emulate in this regard:  <a href=""http://www.fastcolabs.com/3005681/how-hack-broken-gender-dynamics-workplace"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcolabs.com/3005681/how-hack-broken-gender-dyn...</a> )  Help us network and hack and build shit.  Submit pull requests to our lonely little open source projects.  Call other guys out publicly if they act like jerks to us at conferences.  Just...please don't blog about how you wish we would come keep you company at your start-up, as if we were elusive butterflies you want to pin to your wall.<p>Also?  Every time the ""women in tech"" conversation happens, the elephant in the living room that no one likes to mention is that women tend to be the primary caregivers for their kids (or later, for their elderly parents, or disabled siblings, etc.).  This is true of techie women too, and it totally has an effect on the kinds of jobs we take, and when.  Most techie women I know have young kids at home or are planning to have them within the next few years before our biological clocks run out.  (I'm 34 and I have two, ages 5 and 2.)  Does a start-up like Dwolla offer childcare credits or benefits? Onsite daycare? Emergency nanny services? Because a lot of big companies do this, but a lot of startups have no idea that these benefits even exist, much less offer them to their employees.<p>If I know I'm going to be going back to work full-time after having children, what kind of a company do you think I'm going to look at first, a traditional big company or a start-up?  Which one is going to likely offer me better hours and more stability, at a time when my income (and health benefits) are really crucial to other people who are depending upon it?  And that's to say nothing of the culture at the company.  Do I want to work at some start-up that advertises beer nights and paid company dinners as if they're obvious perks, when I honestly look at them and think that ugh, this is yet more time I would have to spend away from my kids.<p>In short, our priorities may not mesh perfectly with your priorities.  :-)",1368829454

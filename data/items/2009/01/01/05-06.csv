Also, if they decide to cancel, you can be down-sell them, issue a credit or keep them bound to the company in some other fashion.<p>The very situation you described is also an important property of the model that makes it not just work, but work <i>great</i>. A lot of people are just too plain lazy to cancel the subscription and their fees add up to more than profits lost due to not having a pay-as-you-go option.",1230788634

Lots of people have schemes.  They might work for a little while, but Google figures them out and often punishes participants.<p>The best information can be found here: <a href=""http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answe...</a><p>In basic: Links to you from <i>reputable</i> sources help you.  Having your pages have good content for users helps you.  Doing anything to manipulate Google will hurt you eventually.  Hiding things (like with CSS), trying to load up on keywords, duplicating content, and other sneaky things hurt you.  Hiding content behind a registration or other thing a search engine can't do hurts you.  Being browsable with a text browser helps you.<p>Google's software is advanced.  If you put something in an H1, it will realize that it's important to your page.  However, if you then resize it to 10px, it's likely to pick up that you're using H1s inappropriately as the Googlebot now grabs CSS as well.<p>And PageRank often isn't as important as other factors.  For example, let's say you want users to find your site when they search for ""blog"".  If people are linking to you with the line ""There are cool accounts at [site name]!"", that's not going to count much to the keyword ""blog"".  However, if people are linking to you with ""Get a [free blog] over at site name!"" it'll help a lot more.  The fact is that one doesn't care about PageRank so much as one cares about where they get placed in results for certain keywords.<p>Most of it is just common sense.  If your site has compelling content, it will be seen positively.  If it doesn't, it won't.  It becomes harder and harder every day to fool Google.  I suggest not trying.  Best case, it boosts you for a short while.  Worst case, you get delisted.",1230788610

416250,comment,416021,416239,0,0,tdavis,,,"I skipped a lot (okay, most) classes during my time in college. It didn't really have much to do with the teacher -- I was just lazy and would rather sleep / write code. It's not necessarily a lack of faith as much as it is a lack of ambition, in some (many?) cases. Sometimes I would take courses where they were teaching topics where there effectively were no gaps in my knowledge. That didn't make them poor professors, either, it just meant I shouldn't have been made to take the course.<p>If anything, I would think consistently low grades would be worse. This means that people are attending the class, but not ""getting it"". I think it's trickier with programming; I met many people in my programming courses who just flat out couldn't understand the basic concepts, despite paying attention, taking copious notes, and spending hours studying.",1230786919

Some people (hackers or not) might have intellectual curiosity about the lives of ordinary people, about how a media organization responded (or, in other stories, failed to respond) to nasty online comments, or about how a simple news item (man on bike killed in hit and run) can be given layers of meaning.

1750264,comment,1749250,1749398,0,0,jbjohns,,,"Personally if you're looking to learn another language I wouldn't bother with Perl.  It's close enough to what you already know that you probably wont learn much [1].  You'll get more milage out of trying something like Smalltalk (Squeak is free and a decent environment) if you want to really learn OO inside out, Haskell if you want to learn functional (this will bend your mind for a while at first, don't give up!), Erlang could be interesting but very unlike most other things.<p>[1] You <i>can</i> probably learn things in Perl that you couldn't in PHP but if you pick a more pure language the lessons will stick out more.  Perl also has a lot of extremely bad practices by default.",1286019643
1750263,comment,1748979,1749703,0,0,bhickey,,,"Suppose that we want to study the underlying genetics of a disease. To do this, we want to look at some people with the disease (cases) and some people without (controls). The trouble is that if the disease makes people more likely to die, they won't be enrolled in your study.<p>This is of particular concern for fast moving diseases like pancreatic cancer. In general this effect manifests as a bias against people with more severe disease -- occasionally these are exactly the people you want to study.<p>The simplest way to get around this is with an alternative study design. Rather than ascertaining <i>cases</i> and <i>controls</i>, you enroll a large number of individuals in a <i>cohort</i>. After that, you sit back and track the cohort for decades and watch for disease to emerge.<p>A famous example of this is the Religious Orders Study (<a href=""http://www.rush.edu/rumc/page-1099611542043.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rush.edu/rumc/page-1099611542043.html</a>). A large number of Catholic brothers and sisters graciously agreed to participate on a study of Alzheimer's disease. The researchers recruited a cohort of non-demented clergy and have been tracking them for years. They perform annual cognitive tests on the participants to assess mental decline. All participants were gracious enough to consent to post-mortem brain donation. It would be impossible to get this sort of data with a case/control study.<p>Another type of ascertainment bias is population stratification which can generate all sorts of misleading results. Imagine that you're a scientist in Boston and you want to study sickle cell anemia. You phone up a doctor friend and say ""Please send me the next 10 sickle cell cases and the next 10 non-sickle cell cases."" After spending $300,000 and a year and a half on the project you find some great mutations. Ten minutes later you notice that all the markers you found are strongly associated with being African-American. Your cases included 9 persons of African ancestry and one of Mediterranean ancestry, while your controls matched the particular demographic blend that you'd expect to find around Boston. Oops.<p>I hope that helps.<p>p.s.

I mean, the original Ask HN question was about what they see a lot of people choosing. I didn't like how this chart was portraying it as Ruby vs. Python.<p>My point is that it used to be PHP, Perl or Java and I think a lot of Java people have moved into Ruby, Python, Scala, etc... Meanwhile, there are still tons of people using PHP (unlike the OP's portrayal that that has stopped somehow). The question marks is to indicate that I don't know what's happened with Perl. I don't know if people still use it for web programming or not.<p>I totally get how it could be hard to read. What is interesting is that it got voted up until you called it nonsensical and then it got voted down to 1 again.

1750252,comment,1748469,1749504,0,0,Mz,,,"FWIW:  I decided to become celibate after the third moron in a row failed to comprehend the statement that ""A condom is a necessity even if pregnancy is not a concern"". I don't have an STD.  I have a compromised immune system and was extremely ill, with one or more antibiotic resistant infections.  Doctors never identified the infection(s) in question.  I concluded that no amount of explaining was going to convey to anyone my belief that they were at risk of exposure to infection (doctors chalk it all up to my genes, so other people go with that mental model and assume that although I can get sick from them, they are somehow magically at zero risk from me) and it would be best to just not go there until I was healthier. (I also concluded they were acting with callous disregard for my welfare, a very big red flag in my book, but that's not really relevant to my point.)<p>So while I agree with some of your points, I really don't think a card or test will address the issue. For one thing, if someone asked me to produce my card (or latest test results), to me that would just scream ""This is just a hook-up. You are nothing but a sex object to me.""  At which point, if I did the traditional dating thing, I imagine I would get up and leave the table.  For another, different people have different levels of understanding of what the risks are.  So I would question what it means for their partners to be ""aware of the risk"".  Do you just give them notice of your state of health or do you have a larger obligation than that to ensure they REALLY get it?  Just giving men notice of my state of health struck me as wholly insufficient.  They blithely climbed into bed with me anyway (and <i>without</i> a condom), apparently oblivious to the potential implications of sleeping with someone who was deathly ill with something doctors did not know how to effectively treat (or even really identify).",1286019096

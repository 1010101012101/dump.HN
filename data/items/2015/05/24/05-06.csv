9595460,comment,9592673,9595392,0,0,pron,,,"First, I don&#x27;t need to provide an explanation to demonstrate that other explanations are completely unfounded. If you don&#x27;t have sufficient data to justify your statistical explanation or if your statistical reasoning is fundamentally flawed, then your explanation is unfounded whether or not I can provide an alternative one. Your statement is like an ancient Greek man saying to another: &quot;Really? So if you don&#x27;t believe in Zeus, what else could explain lightning?&quot; If we don&#x27;t know then we don&#x27;t know. That someone comes up with one bogus explanation doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s valid -- or even a good working hypothesis -- until someone else comes up with another bogus one. It is the magical mind that expects an explanation -- <i>any</i> explanation -- to any phenomenon. Science readily accepts that we just don&#x27;t (yet) have an explanation for many things.<p>Second, there&#x27;s a world of difference between saying something is related to nutrition in general, saying it relates to some global nutritional variable such as calorie intake, and saying something relates to a more specific nutritional variable such as intake of animal fat. While making each of these statements may be dubious due to the inherent difficulty of doing any sort of nutritional research (it must be observational and longitudinal, and there are too many confounding variables), at each of these three levels of nutritional explanation, there are so many more variables being added, so that to prove the third one you&#x27;ll probably need many more samples than there are people on this planet. The dimensionality is just too big to tackle with statistics.<p>Imagine that the real explanation could be something like: amount of animal fat consumed between the ages 0 and 13, and unrelated to anything consumed later. Or it could also be that the same causes of diabetes also reduce the chance of, say, brain cancer, and so what we&#x27;re seeing is actually a good thing. There are just too many variables, especially that we know food interacts in very complex ways with anything from hormones to gut flora.<p>What we <i>can</i> say with certainty is that life expectancy has been increasing steadily (not at a steady pace, of course) since the industrial revolution, and that it is very similar among all industrialized countries. The variations are hardly more than a couple of percentage points in spite of sometimes very different diets, different levels of pollution, different amounts of sunlight, different occupations, different leisure activities etc. So countries are so different, yet life expectancy is almost the same everywhere (in the industrial world, of course). Another thing we know for sure is that life expectancy in the developing world is much, much lower.<p>Of course, rather than clinical studies -- or &quot;clinical&quot;, as nutritional studies are observational and wildly confounded -- one could try to study nutrition through biological metabolism, but we&#x27;re probably decades away from having a really good grasp of human metabolism.",1432446874

9595455,comment,9594635,9595303,0,0,justabystander,,,"You would be surprised about how few &quot;responsible&quot; startups there are. Most will never <i>be</i> responsible until they&#x27;re under scrutiny. I&#x27;ve been with a few that actively derided the idea of compensating employees who were underpaid during the initial growth phases. They thought that because they&#x27;d agreed to help &quot;build the business&quot; that nothing more was owed in better times.<p>One of them got a lot of press as a successful startup and landed several new large contracts. Which is why, after a year of executive self-congratulations and bonuses, their lead developer, who had saved several failed projects singlehandedly, left for more realistic pastures. They only brought him up to just below market when he talked about leaving, had no intentions about rewarding him for past underpaid accomplishments (which were obviously investments on his part), and despite their poor compensation packages had an overly strict culture for non-executives. Management compensation was top priority, and retention was assumed - they thought people would just stay despite having better alternatives. Even if he stayed, he&#x27;d have to watch other people get screwed. He wasn&#x27;t the first, and doubtless he won&#x27;t be the last rat to abandon that ship. I left as well, seeing that they really didn&#x27;t care about anyone who didn&#x27;t have ownership and a briefcase.<p>It&#x27;s really not that uncommon. Being at the top of a company requires only one of three things: luck, lies (&quot;charisma&quot;) or capital. Quite a lot of new business owners get mislead by their own kool-aid. They start believing that their vague &quot;vision&quot; is the most important thing and treat the people who do the real work as replaceable cogs. They give no thought to training costs or productivity and have high turnover rates. Merely treating the staff better could have a huge and positive financial impact. They&#x27;d probably know about these management issues if they didn&#x27;t defensively fire people who voiced dissent. But a fool and his competent staff are soon parted.",1432446591

Or they think they&#x27;ll have more opportunity for promotions in the startup because of its small size and their early stake. The problem is usually executive roles are filled from outside the company rather than from internal promotions, and as this article illustrates, the founders don&#x27;t necessarily care about the people at the bottom until it&#x27;s bluntly pointed out to them how mass departures could fuck up the business.",1432446212

E.g. an organisation without a clear and concrete vision (but with a lot of fantasy) is inherently creating technical debt since it&#x27;s unclear to the developers what exactly needs to build and what the important parts are. It&#x27;s usually that within these organisations every other week a new feature is dreamt up by management that HAS to be included asap or the company might miss out to the competition.<p>Usually management in these type of organisations also LOVE Agile which to them pretty much means; just make shit up as you go along.",1432445938

Without a good router to provide reliable Wi-Fi, \n    your Dropbox file-sharing application is not going to sync; without \n    Nvidia’s graphics processing unit, your BuzzFeed GIF is not going to \n    make anyone laugh. The talent — and there’s a ton of it — flowing into \n    Silicon Valley cares little about improving these infrastructural \n    elements. What they care about is coming up with more web apps.\n</code></pre>\nWhile I agree somewhat in principle, especially with the example about GPUs, but I think the viewpoint of this article greatly discounts the value of the open-source byproducts from many of the Web 2.0 companies.<p>For example, scaling to the levels that Facebook has presented many novel challenges and opportunities to push productivity in traditional computing areas. The open-compute project, face recognition, apache thrift (which builds upon ideas that began with protocol buffers), etc. are all ways in which some foundational technologies were the by-product of pursuing the creation of a social software empire.<p>That said, I also think this journalist is blindly by his own industry. There are plenty of cool startups working on foundational technology, it&#x27;s just that they aren&#x27;t as sexy and stories about them don&#x27;t attract as many eyeballs. Take Planet Labs for example. That&#x27;s some pretty foundational area in terms of how Space has been valuable to humans and they are aiming to democratize access to have an eye in Space.

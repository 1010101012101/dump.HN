I'm quite proficient in English, not as good as my mother tongue, but I understand everything that is said to me and my vocabulary is quite extensive; however my accent is east-european with no doubt.<p>What I've found out is that while Americans are a lot more insensitive (tolerant?) to broken accents the British absolutely can't stand it. They avoid talking to people with bad accent and will generally walk away form any conversation with somebody of a non-british accent. I've observed this with brits around the world, not only in the UK and for sure it's not related to talking among conationals only: generally they are willing to engage in conversations with people that are obviously not british as long as they speak proper english with proper accent.<p>Of course you can not generalize the above to every brit in the world however this is my observation.<p>About blogs I observed in a comparative study that pages not ending in .com are just a bit less likely to be clicked.<p>About a written message, what can I say?

Young managers stick around at hedge funds not just because they get incentivized with a percentage of their returns, but also because it is hard for them to raise sufficient capital to start their own fund. Most of them would probably prefer to manage that 25-100M in their own fund and take the entire 20% of generated returns instead of sharing it with the fund. Generally when they have the experience and contacts to do so they _do_ go out and start their own fund.<p>Quite the opposite, it doesn't take much capital to start a web company any more. Consequently, lots of teams of engineers can leave a big company and build up value on their own with out the support structure (i.e. capital) of a bigger company.

CassFS definitely looks fun learning project.<p>What I'd really love to see, is an article that explains the goals/niche/maturity/strengths/weaknesses of various distributed storage solutions.<p>Can anyone here offer a recommendation?  (For example, here's something similar: <a href=""http://www.metabrew.com/article/anti-rdbms-a-list-of-distributed-key-value-stores/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metabrew.com/article/anti-rdbms-a-list-of-distrib...</a> )<p>I've been casually researching this topic for months and I still feel so overwhelmed!  Not many people are giving a clear picture of what they're trying to accomplish, when/how their system should be used, and how they compare to others.<p>I'm mostly asking because I recently ended up writing my own.  It's just a Python script that sends a UDP message to all our servers asking who has the file.  First person to respond wins and the file is downloaded via nginx.  Replication is accomplished with durable message queues which are consumed during off-peak hours.  It took days to code and suits our needs perfectly.<p>I learned from this project that reliable, scalable, distributed data storage is very simple, if you focus on solving a very specific use-case scenario.",1266020175

That said, often people assume it is a British accent, not an Australian accent.<p>I think because people from outside Australia often have the preconception that Aussies should sound like crocodile-dundee, or as we call it - &#x27;okka&#x27;.  What they hear from most Aussies is what they associate more closely with a British accent. Although it isn&#x27;t quite right, it is so far from the preconception of what an Aussie sounds like, British is the closet thing they associate it with.",1378022377

Courts exist to weigh such arguments.<p>In fact, &quot;objective evidence of nonobviousness&quot; is already a well-established concept in patent law [0].

In that definition, a function able to produce random numbers is not (cannot be) smaller than the resulting set, i.e. it has maximum entropy. The reason is that a function that is smaller than its result implies that a pattern is being exploited, and that, in turn, implies that the set isn&#x27;t random (such a set by definition would have no exploitable patterns).<p>Another test, based on the same ideas, is a hypothetical compression algorithm, not one that we know of or can write, that is put to the task of compressing the &quot;random&quot; set. If the compression algorithm cannot make the set smaller, the set is random. This also addresses the issue of exploitable patterns and entropy.<p>But all these ways of thinking about randomness relies on the set being infinite in size (or an inexhaustible function as a source for the test values). If this condition isn&#x27;t met, and if we acquire a finite set of numbers of size N, one can argue that the next set of that size will be a repetition of the same values, therefore not random. This objection can only be answered by defining the problem in terms of an infinite set.",1378019615

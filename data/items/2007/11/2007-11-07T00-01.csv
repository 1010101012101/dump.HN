I took your saying ""I know"" to mean ""I have coded in each of these languages and could do something in each if I had to"", instead of ""I would be comfortable in a programming environment with any of these languages"".<p>My bad.<p>btw  I actually am trying out SICP right now, despite my C# leanings.

A quick look at ronpaulforums.com will confirm that.  <p>However, if they were successful at doing what you describe wouldn't your prediction imply that most Ron Paul stories on Reddit would have a score greater than zero?   A search for ""Ron Paul"" shows this to be false.  <p>Is there some other objective measure that could be used?",1194394927

76833,comment,76469,76645,0,0,pg,,,"No.  The topics reddit has focused on so far have generally been the topics hackers are interested in.  That's why the Ron Paul stories stand out so much.  I know a huge cross section of hackers of all different types, and Ron Paul doesn't figure anything near as large in their conversation as he does on reddit.<p>It would be easy to astroturf reddit.  And I don't think even Ron Paul suppporters would deny that the campaign most likely to do it would be that of an outsider candidate whose supporters were renowned for their effective use of the Internet.<p>But you know, I am done talking about this.  Whenever I even mention Ron Paul I end up wasting hours in arguments isomorphic to arguments with trolls.  I'm not claiming Ron Paul supporters are trolls, just that trying to reason with fanatics tend to produce the same sort of threads as trying to reason with trolls.<p>The discussion on this thread is precisely why politics is off limits on news.yc.  In this case it crept in through a point about the design of news aggregators.  But politics is like floating point contagion. If you make a point that's even partly about politics, that's the part everyone will focus on,
and the discussion becomes a political one.",1194394843

Well, the fact that so many strawberries nowadays are large and water-filled (from being over-watered) to make them look super-sized rather than more flavour-packed smaller runtier berries may imply there are quite a few consumers who can't identify a good strawberry. ",1194393622

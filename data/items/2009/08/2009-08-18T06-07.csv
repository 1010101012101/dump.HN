No matter how unlikely events turn out to be, <i>somebody</i> is eventually going to be right, and then that person is lauded as a genius for having forecasted correctly.

Doesn't the fact that it burst <i>by definition</i> mean that most people did not recognize it?<p>But Taleb makes a different point: Discounting the apocalypse is <i>exactly</i> what he's arguing against, because this is essentially what LTCM et al were doing with their models. They calculated probabilities to make sure that the estimated payoff was greater than the estimated loss, but they got the distributions wrong. What you should try to do is make sure that the apocalypse can't happen, that you aren't exposed so that one outlier will take you down. Because due to the nature of the system (there is only a sample of one of the world economy) you simply <i>can't</i> gather data that can pin down the wings of the distributions to the precision you need.<p>According to the models used at the time, the Black Monday 1987 was something like a 30-sigma event.

The cellphone seemed to just be a quick confirmation that he was still alive. Though it would seem awfully suspicious for him to abandon his cellphone without reporting it missing/stolen (even if the police tracked down the thief).<p>[ I'm assuming he didn't report it missing, because the article doesn't say so, and because it doesn't make sense that messages sent to unknown numbers from a stolen cellphone would mean that he's alive to investigators. ]",1250575583

Companies need money.  Investors have money.<p>As for some god-given right to bank accounts, I never said any such thing.  It's not my fault, nor Wall Street's fault, that people aren't better prepared to understand finance.  It's a dog eat dog world.  If you want to keep hold of your money, learn how to invest for yourself, place it with a broker and accept that even they may lose money, or hide it in your bed.  Those are your options.<p><i>Under capitalism, we use the market to allocate capital efficiently, to its most productive use.</i><p>You are not distilling finance enough.  Your definition is a first-year economics definition.  That's a definition from an idealized world.  In the real world, companies exchange shares for cash.  They invest that cash into the business to create value.  Other instruments have their own purposes, but it's all about taking either money or risk and transferring it from one party to another based on needs.",1250575560

Whatever you may think of Taleb, his work is more of a popularization of catastrophe theory than it is basic probability. He even says as much in his writings.",1250575511

Why not have multiple brands that separate levels of service, instead of having the same service with different subscription levels for features.<p>Using flickr as a example. They offer free and pro. Instead, why not have two web fronts (both using the same backend still). One is called Flickr and would be free, but the other would be Blingr which is paid and looks completely different, a new brand.<p>A good real world example is Toyota + Lexus (imagine on the backend it's the same people working).<p>Why do this?<p>It's easy to implement, and you can really tap in to the folks who have ego and love exclusivity and want to spend.

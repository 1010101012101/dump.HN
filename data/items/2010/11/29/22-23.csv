If you stop taking the investor's money it's either because your company has become profitable, or because you have been able to do a round of funding at a higher valuation. Either of these means that the investor has started to get a return on their money, which is way better than sinking their entire investment into a company that fails. Your investor can even do a partial exit at the next round, reimbursing themselves for 100% of their original investment, and still have shares left over. Shouldn't the investor incentivize the entrepreneur to do this?",1291071579

1952203,comment,1952014,1952014,0,0,jcromartie,,,"Great philosophy on game design. RPGs generally suffer from terrible game design, and they get away with it because of their audience. Big sprawling RPG video games strive to be as complicated as their paper counterparts, and that's exactly what players are looking for; at least the traditional RPG market.<p>They're the Perl of video games.<p>I picked up Oblivion (a few years late) and am kind of turned off by what seems to be a complete lack of attention to the player's experience. All of the work went into the world and game system. The environment, items, spells, NPCs, AI, towns etc. are all the focal point of the game and NOT the gameplay or the interactions that are part of playing the game. Swinging a sword feels like no action at all. Swinging a sword and hitting an enemy is <i>completely</i> anticlimactic, as there is no feedback other than perhaps some audio and the enemy health bar decreasing. Most RPGs suffer from this lack of visceral or juicy feedback.<p>As for the situation on the App Store; when ""perusing various games on the App Store ... 'unimpressed' is a severe understatement"" is my sentiment as well. But the tricky thing is that the <i>successful</i> games/apps are not always the best. It doesn't necessarily require taste, principles, or even a huge effort to get a smash hit.",1291071559

1952174,comment,1949227,1950352,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"The thing is that while they come under apparently ""reasonable"" auspices, like automating traffic cops, they are still cameras that already have all the fundamental components of a surveillance system; it just has to be hooked up to a database somewhere and the same thing is easily implemented. They already have OCR software reading plates and printing out and mailing tickets, so if the feds, a state, or municipality were so inclined, they could without much additional effort tack on a database that tracked what-cars-were-where.<p>That's just one nefarious purpose and deployment, I'm sure if we thought about it more we'd come up with many others. The CCTV cameras that litter Britain were also installed under the ""reasonable"" auspice of catching people who stab each other. The red-light cameras are not so blatant, but the principle is the same, and as people become more and more acclimated to those, it'll be an easier sell to do Britain-like CCTV monitoring.<p>So it's really an issue of trust. Do you trust the government to keep their promises and never use these widely-deployed networks of cameras for evil? Do we believe that the government will only ever use these to catch those who violate traffic law? Do we expect an equitable and reasonable enforcement when we outsource to machines? If you're speeding because your wife is in labor or your grandma is dying and you get pulled over, the policeman will usually do an immediate reversal and offer an escort instead of a citation. Do we want to replace that with automated cameras so that one with a medical emergency gets 3-4 tickets from machines that detected he violated the speed limit or ran a red light on the way to the hospital?<p>The Constitution is proactive against the attainment of such government power because its framers knew that even though you may have one set of administrators that are pretty good and upright, the next set may be more crooked, and when the crooked people see all this unexploited potential, they're that much more likely to attempt to attain to a position that will allow them to enact uncouth practices.",1291071167

It might be different now, because Texas now has a 10% rule that grants a scholarship to students who graduate in the top ten percent of their class.  (For a couple of years you got automatic admission to the state school of your choice for graduating in the top ten percent, but that resulted in half of UT's admissions going to 10% students, many of whom were very poorly prepared, so they changed the rule.)  There were probably a few kids in my class -- very hard-working and curious but not as bright -- whose GPAs were hurt by taking honors classes, and they probably fell out of the top 10% because of it.  There's no way anyone could crack the top 1% or 2% without taking lots of honors classes, though.<p>It's possible our honors classes were less rigorous than yours, too.

By looks it's hollow aluminum, a decent gauge but I work with aluminum and this doesn't appear at all sturdy for brute forcing the lock.<p>Aluminum is rather malleable, meaning it looks like force could easily be used to open the device enough to get it back down to ground level, at which point brute forcing becomes much easier. It also looks highly susceptible to leverage forcing or even wedging (which can be done very simply with two hammers)<p>Standard bike locks have the advantage that leveraging the bars generally only fastens the locking mechanism tighter meaning force has to be applied parallel to the bars against the lock - noticeably along the mechanisms strongest axis. Every other way generally fails in a way that makes it harder to separate the lock from its bars.<p>This being a circle allows forces to be applied to directly manipulate hinges, welds, and the lock. However, given that it fits tightly against the lamp post, it is highly susceptible to leverage - unlike a standard bike lock that has a solid 1 foot gap between the end of the bars and the mechanism, which reduces the leveraging potential enormously. You could easily get 40x the leverage on this climbing lock than you could on a standard bike lock.<p>The actual lock they place on this wouldn't last 2 seconds against a $5 screwdriver, I'm assuming it would be a genuine locking mechanism. However the device will have at least 4 welds at best, or likely a non-welded joint, 1 hinge or set of hinges and 1 lock. This means your lock is only as strong as your weakest element and if you're using a hinge, it's likely only as strong as a 1/8th screw.<p>Step 1: brake the wheels with hammer and bring it to ground.\nStep 2: Force a prybar under the hinge plate.\nStep 3: hammer the prybar and brake screws.\nStep 4: ride off on bike.",1291070900

Imagine how our system would treat a student who aced every test, completed every assignment perfectly, but who habitually truanted and generally refused to toe the line.<p>If schools were simply a place of teaching and learning, such a student should face no problems, but in most schools he would be highly unlikely to graduate. The imposition of discipline is not merely a secondary function necessary to facilitate teaching, it is an end in itself. Children are taught that a teacher must be obeyed because he is powerful, not because he is worth listening to. There is a clear and persistent message that teachers should be respected and obeyed simply because they have a bigger desk. Even in jurisdictions where it is relatively easy to dismiss incompetent teachers, they are rarely dealt with. I believe that there is simply no demand to do so, as teaching is merely a ruse to allow for schooling to happen.<p>I argue that the failures of our school system are not simply symptomatic of underfunding, union problems or poor strategy. They are the product of our inability to define the purpose of schooling, our unwillingness to confront the role of schools as cheap daycare, and our hypocrisy as to the real purpose of schooling as a thing apart from education.",1291070366

Level3 set a terrible precedent here by paying the shakedown money.  Even with their subsequent complaints, they've now put Comcast in a much better position by implicitly acknowledging (whether true or not) that Comcast brings more value to the table by providing access to its subscriber base than content-providers bring to the table by supplying content to subscribers.<p>Like the old Churchill story goes, ""now we're just negotiating the price.""<p>(See PS #4 below for a more benign interpretation.)<p>--<p>PS #1: Yes, of course it might have been expensive for them to play hardball here, with respect to the short-term harm it might cause their customers.  That's exactly the point.  By acknowledging that the harm to Comcast would be lower (which I actually doubt), they've significantly strengthened Comcast's position against other carriers and perhaps even with regulators.<p>PS #2: Game theory would suggest that it's critical for Netflix to repel this assault now, even at the cost of short term pain.  Once this precedence is established, Comcast will be able to extract nearly all of the profit from Netflix sales to Comcast customers.  Each time Comcast raises the toll, it would be in Netflix's rational self interest to go along so long as they are still making some net profit on the channel (modulo opportunity costs and whatnot).<p>PS #3: It's not uncommon for carriers to play hardball.  The big Tier 1's have been trying to prevent the ascension of Cogent into their club for years, which (along with Cogent's aggressiveness) resulted in some nasty peering dispute stalemates in 2005 (with Level3) and 2008 (with Sprint), each time ""breaking the internet.""<p>PS #4: It's also possible that Level3 is representing this as a net neutrality issue when in reality it's just a peering dispute.  Traditionally local ISPs have had to pay for transit across the networks of the big carriers.  When a local ISP becomes a large regional or national one (Comcast), they have enough leverage to extract no-charge (""settlement-free"") peering agreements with most of the major carriers.  This is probably the first case, though, of a cable-company ISP becoming large enough to extract transit fees from a big international carrier.  That's noteworthy, but if it is content-neutral, it's still the way the internet has always worked.",1291069970

The time scales are also different since it's more of a ""flash"" sale than anything.<p>The one way that people break out of the chicken and egg situation is by using the ""Bowling pin strategy"" (more info here <a href=""http://edgehopper.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edgehopper.com/</a>). So you start with one niche and then scale out intelligently from there. Again, this is what Groupon did by starting in SF and then growing from there.<p>Based on this my advice would be to start in SF - as they seem to be the early adopters of the world. From my experience there finding a cab is a major pain in the ass. However, the times that you'd use this service are when you're taking a pretty expensive cab ride, usually from the airport. With SF how many people take cabs from the airport vs the BART? If it's not a lot, then you have some difficulty.<p>Is there a city in the world that has a lot of people taking cabs from the airport?<p>Actually, now that I think about it. Any ""route"" where a sufficiently large number of people would regularly be paying a substantial cab fare would almost certainly have an alternative means of transportation. Whether this be public transportation, shuttle services, etc. More often than not I think you'd find that society at large has already implemented your taxi sharing.<p>In which case you need to identify those very specific places where the market is lagging behind and therefore your app has real utility there. At which point you'd have to aggressively market your app in those markets to gain real penetration and hope for critical mass.<p>To be honest, the use case is so limited I have a difficult time seeing how you'd get that critical mass.<p>Though your idea has given me another idea. An app that lets taxi drivers schedule with individuals directly. How many times do you take a taxi where the driver will give you their card and say ""Give me a call if you want a ride?"" Well, if you have an app that connects drivers with riders in an easy fashion, then you can get into a situation where everybody's incentives are aligned. You can get the driver to give the rider a discount, the driver does this for guaranteed income, the rider does it for the discount, and you do it because you get a small cut. You can then expand into a ""group ride"" policy because your already having a person plan out their route.",1291068068

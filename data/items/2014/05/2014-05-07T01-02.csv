The consumer is also able to educate themself on products more easily (because of the internet). So high-quality products are more affordable, but not necessarily cheap. It&#x27;s awesome. You see this happening with everything from Warby parker to Tonx coffee to clothing startups like Frank & Oak.<p>My company, Original Fuzz, just launched a guitar strap that uses Horween leather (<a href=""http://www.originalfuzz.com/products/skinny-leather-guitar-strap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.originalfuzz.com/products/skinny-leather-guitar-s...</a>), and we could have never made it with Horween 10 years ago. We&#x27;re able to sell it for $48 because we can find customers from around the world through the web. You don&#x27;t have to do the traditional keystone pricing and leave room for retailers and distributors if you don&#x27;t want to.",1399427987

7708210,comment,7708067,7708146,1,0,clevep,,,"Thanks for the thorough feedback! We will look into the Chrome issue immediately. We all use Chrome as our preferred browser, so I&#x27;m a bit shocked that it completely choked. I suspect one of the add ons, but you are right, it should absolutely fail elegantly.<p>The multiple index photos pointing to the same stories was an editorial decision, as they wanted a location to show off all of their favorite imagery from the issue, even if some of the links were duplicative. This is similar to a magazine&#x27;s ToC, where they will occasionally have multiple items referencing the same page number, however point taken that this creates an annoying experience if you accidentally hop to the same story multiple times. Perhaps we&#x27;ll explore some sort of visual indicator for already visited stories.<p>Side by side pages forming a spread is a tricky issue. We wanted to allow our editors the freedom to create magazine-like layouts with text interacting with other elements such as images, videos, and lists, but building layouts which conform to the dimensions of all devices is difficult. In print, designers only have to deal with one canvas size when laying out their spreads. On the web, text will wrap in different places and you need to dynamically resize elements so that text is readable and images are suitably sized. This results in inconsistent page breaks, which makes side by side viewing difficult to achieve cleanly. Some products have attempted to achieve this affect on the web, but we ultimately thought the tradeoffs necessary to implement those techniques were not worth it and that we would have a richer product with entirely vertical layouts. There is an additional UX consideration there as well, but I&#x27;m droning on.<p>I agree on the slideshows lacking the gravitas of the cover. We have already begun product planning to improve that feature.<p>Thanks again!",1399427690

My guess is that they are going to withhold approval until the issue is resolved.  So they aren&#x27;t necessarily demanding easement concessions, but they aren&#x27;t going to issue permits until the dispute has either been settled in the courts, eminent domain has been used, or a settlement is reached.<p>EDIT: Actually, if you dig a little deeper into that case, the ruling has little impact on the Martin&#x27;s Beach case.  In the Nollan case, the CCC was requesting an access road/path where none had previously existed.  The CCC&#x27;s argument was actually pretty weak, they were claiming that the development would result in &quot;psychological impediments to public access&quot; which gave them the right to demand concessions.  In the Martin&#x27;s Beach case, the CCC should have the power to demand public access concessions if the road historically served as a public access point (assuming the federal treaty issues don&#x27;t negate that power).\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nollan_v._California_Coastal_Commission"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nollan_v._California_Coastal_Co...</a>",1399426497

I don&#x27;t know if this is due to AdBlock Pro, Chrome&#x27;s popup blocker, Ghostery, or Disconnect, but I didn&#x27;t feel like testing them one-by-one. Obviously it&#x27;s a commercial offering, but I think it needs to fail mroe elegantly than just hanging. It opened fine in an incognito window.<p>I opened it up in IE with no problems, and was surprised to find it a little faster than Chrome - but IE is my fallback browser and I don&#x27;t have any extensions or addons loading there for that reason.<p>I didn&#x27;t especially care for the &#x27;start&#x27; tab. I would let the titles fly in behind the image as before, but on touching the image anywhere I&#x27;d then shrink the cover photo down to its tile and have the others fade in.<p>As for the project itself, once I could get access I was impressed - it did a good job of bridging the gap between magazine and web presentation. I <i>really</i> liked the simple but effective page navigator buttons which are presumably optimized for tablet use but also saved me from tedious scrolling on the desktop. The ToC was good too, although I would have liked an easier way to get back to the initial tiled layout, which I preferred. I did <i>not</i> like that different tiles took me to the same articles on some occasions. I didn&#x27;t always read the captions before clicking, and was confused to find myself going back to articles I had already read.<p>Overall I would give it 7 out of 10 (overlooking the access problems mentioned above, which I think need to be fixed as a priority). Although I&#x27;m not the target reader and found the writing a bit gushy, there was a good balance between visual and textual content that was well realized in the interactive context. The only negative I felt while reading the magazine was the sense of being constrained by the vertical page orientation on a desktop monitor, resulting in a lot of empty space on the sides, a pet peeve of mine.<p>If there was some way to show two pages side by side (like an actual magazine) I would give 9 out of 10. to me one of the great joys of magazines and books is being able to open them wide and feast one&#x27;s eyes on well-balanced horizontal layout - I&#x27;ve never understood why some people like to fold the spine over and only do this very occasionally. I feel like the single-page paradigm is a path-dependent one that has been driven by the screen size limitations of devices like Kindle and various tablets, but which leaves me feeling like I&#x27;ve lost an eye. I hope you could explore this in future iterations; given the subject matter of eh magazine it seems like a natural candidate to try out these ideas. I felt a bit sad that nothing inside the magazine matched the powerful visual impression of the frame-filling intro photo. Browsing the photo stack that was in some articles was an inferior substitute and didn&#x27;t take full advantage of available screen space.",1399425876

7708107,comment,7706915,7707708,2,0,daviding,,,"Just to clarify what I meant by the &#x27;unsubscribe&#x27; part, many newsletters (like your Costco example from the OP) contain an unsubscribe link without an email but with a unique id in the href. When clicking this you often get to a page that then lets you unsubscribe and sometimes also see who the address was subscribed too, which defeats the purpose. I&#x27;m not sure what would be the ideal solution, but you could hit it with a hammer and remove all hrefs from the content in the email DOM, or perhaps parse explicitly for unsubscribe links (harder, as they vary, a bit of NLP etc). Alternatively, just consider the page as &#x27;not for hostiles&#x27;, in that the user should only share with people who wouldn&#x27;t hunt for mischief in the first place.<p>For next steps and parsing, it really depends on if you want to store a user graph your end, i.e. do you want to also initiate the &#x27;share&#x27; and know who is looking at the link? If you do then the features go in one direction (collaboration, conversations, actionable stuff) but if you don&#x27;t want that then it&#x27;s sort of a different animal (formatting, i.e. galleries, content suggestions and the like).<p>For a font, Helvetica Neue or anything in that family is all the rage ;)",1399424914

Autonomous cars will be capable of producing reasonably objective measurements of driving condition safety... I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised winter storms are more routinely capable of inducing conditions that are worse than we humans really realize. Or, alternatively, that <i>we</i> realize are dangerous but choose to drive in anyhow, but no autonomous care programmer would ever choose to accept.",1399424914
7708105,comment,7707665,7707665,7,0,Schwolop,,,"I have personally written algorithms to select paths for 800kg autonomous vehicles operating around humans and livestock, and that minimise some cost function. My cost functions always treated crashes as (effectively) infinite cost. In the limit case where all possible paths had such an infinite cost, the failure mode was to revoke any electrical system that could increase the kinetic energy of the vehicle, apply maximum braking power (and/or any other subsystem that would serve reduce the kinetic energy of the vehicle), disconnect any chemical stores of energy from any activation system (i.e. stall the engine), and then finally - and as a direct consequence of these actions - maintain heading/steering angle.<p>Since we elected to revoke all power systems, we lose the ability to steer. We&#x27;re attempting to reduce the kinetic energy of the system to zero as rapidly as possible (since we&#x27;ve computed that there are no viable controlled manoeuvres available), and we concluded that the best (and in fact only) option was to maintain trajectory whilst trying to slow down.<p>As a result, I don&#x27;t think this argument has merit. There is no concept of &quot;who should we crash into&quot; because both are unacceptable, and we&#x27;d let physics take over instead.",1399424887

You won&#x27;t define what are good or bad boundaries in code anymore than you will define &quot;5 easy rules to author a great piece of fiction&quot;. The computer doesn&#x27;t give a damn about separated concerns, it&#x27;s all about communication between humans. As such it is a matter of feeling, dare I say emotion, and not a matter of laws and rules. Ultimately our ability to break problems in sub-problems tends to be bounded by the words we have at our disposal.<p>The TCP/IP stack exemple in the Wikipedia article linked below hints at SoC pretty well in my opinion. One layer allow the layer above to disregard details about the physical link. The next layer makes cross-network addressing transparent. The next one allows apps to disregard packet ordering and loss, and so on. Each layer solves a problem for the one above. Yet one can have multiple responsibilities. This is all about cognitive load.<p>A system described in code is nothing more than a proposed consensus around tools, names, boundaries, paradigms to be used to talk and think about a solution to a problem. The ultimate measure of success is this: our ability to tame the binary beast. If &quot;change&quot; plays a role (it sure does) it&#x27;s probably not the main or only metric. Well ... when you&#x27;re not selling &quot;ability to change&quot; consulting and books to software companies, this goes without saying.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns</a>",1399424728

8286870,comment,8278408,8281174,1,0,__david__,,,"Darcs doesn&#x27;t support branches—it&#x27;s just a collection of patches in every repo. Our Darcs project was set up with a &quot;dev&quot; repo where we&#x27;d dump everything and then promote patches to &quot;beta&quot; repo and then the &quot;production&quot; repo. The downside was that &quot;dev&quot; was filled with a lot of dead end patches that needed finishing/fleshing out before they could go to production. In git, those are now on separate branches and so the main development line is <i>much</i> cleaner. We could have done that with Darcs, but it would require multiple repos (one for each branch), both on the server and on our development machines (yuck).<p>The first thing we did after converting the Darcs repo to Git was to run a complicated rebase script that split all the dev repo patches into logical git branches. If you looked at the Git repo at that point it would be a single linear set of commits which then explodes into 14 or 15 different branches all at the same point.<p>Since then we&#x27;ve been using feature branches to do our development and Git really helps to keep distractions to a minimum. &quot;git stash&quot; and feature branches mean that random stuff I am trying is filed away neatly and doesn&#x27;t pollute my working directory like it did when we were Darcs based.<p>Honestly I don&#x27;t really miss anything from Darcs. I could fib and say Darcs&#x27;s cherry-picking is better than Git&#x27;s, but while that&#x27;s true, I don&#x27;t really cherry pick much in Git (it&#x27;s usually only to fix accidental checkins on the wrong branch) and so I don&#x27;t hit conflicts often (at all, really).<p>Darcs allowed us <i>really</i> simple deployment (we&#x27;d just push our patches to the live server—not the cleanest, but oh so easy). Git required us to write a hook that deploys when we push to the production branch. <i>However</i>, that was actually a blessing in disguise, since now the hook can do good stuff like reload the server when the code changes and rebuild static assets as appropriate. We used to just do that by hand.",1410206350

In particular, it can be operated in two modes:<p>1. Untyped mode. Here we parse out values of type, amusingly, Value which reflect the total, untyped structure of JSON. We can then express queries deep inside of that structure and see what get&#x27;s pulled out. For instance, using the `lens-aeson` package<p><pre><code>    v :: Value\n    \n    x :: Maybe Integer -- Maybe means it might fail\n    x = v ^? key &quot;foo&quot; \n           . key &quot;bar&quot;\n           . key &quot;baz&quot;\n           . ix  3\n           . _Integer  -- looks a bit like XPath, right?\n</code></pre>\n2. Typed mode. Now we suggest to Aeson that some of the types of our program have direct translation into or from JSON (or both) and let the parser produce these translations in a type safe way. For instance, should we have a type like<p><pre><code>    data Point = Point { x :: Double, y :: Double }\n</code></pre>\nthen we can introduce a translation like<p><pre><code>     instance FromJSON Point where\n       parseJSON = withObject &quot;Point&quot; $ \\o ->\n         Point <$> o .: &quot;x&quot;\n               <*> o .: &quot;y&quot;\n</code></pre>\nwhich indicates that JSON objects of a syntax like `{&quot;x&quot;: 1, &quot;y&quot;: 1}` can be parsed into `Point`s. Technically, the parser designed there is minimal in that JSON objects with more fields can still be properly parsed, although that can be fixed.<p>Finally, you can easily anoint your untyped mode XPath-like queries with typed fragments. This is especially powerful if your typed fragments include untyped JSON Value fragments <i>inside</i> of them. It means that we can use lenses to dive into an untyped JSON Value, parse some fragment of it into a Point in a type-sensitive fashion, then dive further into that Point. If Points contained more JSON values then that &quot;further dive&quot; could be untyped or typed again.",1410204933

So, except for the laser driven - which due to low efficiency of lasers have very low miniaturization potential - the inertial confinement hasn&#x27;t got any meaningful development during all that time until current days when mostly private money got into it.<p>>What was decided 20 years ago? Where?<p>Somewhere in 199x i remember reading something like a Congress committee&#x27;s paperwork where cost of fusion was very unfavorably compared to the $0.04 cost of coal energy with thus pretty clear conclusion about economical unviability of fusion. It was like a bulb lit in my head back then - &quot;that explains!&quot; :).<p>Edit: to the comment below - i should have worded better, the inertial confinement schemas are obviously better for developing future reactors as, at least, since understanding of bremsstrahlung losses in thermodynamically equilibrium plasmas it became clear the enormous, on the border of any practicality, size of possible break-even reactor and other limitation on them. Like no aneutronic p-Boron even in the great-great future of Star Trek. Where is inertial confinement have no such limits. As H-bomb - a successful break-even inertial confinement device shows - it is just a matter of miniaturization. Look at Sandia Z-machine for example - basically miniature model of what happens inside H-bomb after fission primary goes off - they aren&#x27;t in a rush for any practical reactor, mind you, only to reproduce explosion conditions for weapons research - yet even from the start - something like in 1998 they were immediately closer to the goal than everybody else. 10-15% input conversion into X-rays at the 100TWt+ peak - that can be reached by NIF only today only if they replace the current lasers with semiconductor ones.",1410204891

Right now there exist 3 different ways of developing your extensions.

If you decide to go with the new tool you will find out that there is no documentation how the import system works, except another blog post[4] that just says they are now using npm. Good luck with figuring out all the details.<p>But I think the main problem with Firefox is that once the Addon is inside the browser there is no sandboxing. The Addon has the same privileges as the Firefox process, including the potential to modify other Addons at runtime. That&#x27;s why the review process is taking such a long time, they basically need to hand check all of your source code to catch if you are doing something nasty. If you don&#x27;t ask in Chrome for some permission you will just not have access to this API, but not in Firefox. No permissions, always full access. This is an enormous security risk, because it is impossible to check all corner cases of big Addons and be sure that the Addon will not get code from outside and just eval it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/jpm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/jpm</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2014/08/19/announcing-add-on-sdk-1-17/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2014/08/19/announcing-add-on...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://work.erikvold.com/jetpack/2014/08/07/cfx-to-jpm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://work.erikvold.com/jetpack/2014/08/07/cfx-to-jpm.html</a>",1410203750

8286600,comment,8284655,8284655,8,0,brendangregg,,,"Xen is a great technology, and the community has accomplished much in terms of features and performance improvements. But I doubt the long term future is Containers/Docker inside Xen guests, instead of just bare-metal.<p>Reasons to pick bare-metal:<p>1. Price/performance. For many CPU-bound workloads the Xen overheads are negligible, but for I/O-bound workloads the overheads add up. The network code path, especially at 10 GbE speeds, is sensitive to any wasted cycles. For large sites with thousands of instances, these overheads mean less efficiency, and needing to run more instances, costing more for the business.<p>Can the future of Xen eliminate (or near eliminate) I/O overheads, so that their resource cost is near bare-metal? Put differently: will there be a future where all I/O paths in AWS EC2 access PCI passthrough, or some similar technology to bypass synchronous overheads? That would be great, but is this realistic? Bare-metal provides this level of performance today.<p>2. Debugability. Many environments are sensitive to latency outliers, and measure the 95th and higher latency percentiles. Root causing these is difficult on hardware virtualized environments, where latencies end at the hypercalls, but easier for bare-metal environments. Even with root access on both the host and guests, tracing I/O between them can be painstaking work, as the host can&#x27;t see and trace inside the guest. (Is the Xen going to solve this problem? Eg, could I have a SystemTap script trace both guest application-level I/O requests and associate them with host device level I/O? I suppose it can be done, but will it?) On bare-metal with containers, the host can see all, and trace I/O seamlessly from guest processes to bare-metal devices. Currently.<p>3. Density or efficiency. Resources can be shared at a finer level of granularity with cgroups, than is really practical with virtualized devices such as CPUs. Unless you are only running one big Xen guest on a host.<p>Xen (and KVM) are here to stay: there will always be the need for different kernel support for legacy applications. But for very large sites with thousands of instances, the future (although it may take a while) for sites with many instances and are performance sensitive, is likely bare-metal + Containers/Docker.<p>If you&#x27;re a small site, or you care less about performance and debugging, then there may well be merit in the work this article covers.",1410203680

If I may be so bold as to presume that I just <i>barely</i> qualify as an &quot;expert&quot; here:<p>The lidar in your vacuum (presumably a neato-XV series; if so, you have fine taste sir/madam) is no more than a spinning laser range finder. These work by offsetting a laser from a linear image sensor (imagine a camera with a crazy wide aspect ratio, maybe 256x6 resolution) and calculating distance by simple trigonometry or a pre-calibrated look-up table. These are called spinning parallax lidar. Their output is two dimensional in polar coordinates (angle, distance).<p>More expensive lidar systems use carrier wave phase measurements (modulate the laser to a known signal, look for its reflection and calculate phase difference), direct time of flight measurements (like narrow beam sonic range finding, but with light, requires very expensive timing circuitry), doppler shift, and/or various structured light transformation/interference effects. Some units only use one of these techniques, some use a combination of these techniques. Most of these units operate using a number of lasers simultaneously to spit out 3 dimensional data, either as planar depth maps, or as 3D polar coordinates (angle-x, angle-y, radius). Either way, all of these are expensive because they require very fast <i>and</i> very precise complex analog circuitry, tight controls on noise sources (RF interference, temperature dependence, very good power isolation), tight controls on spurious emissions (GHz oscillators), careful calibration, and most importantly, very complicated software.<p>To me, time of flight is the most interesting, but the least practical/likely to be made inexpensive. For a DIY example of the kind of timing circuitry involved, check out [1].<p>That said, there&#x27;s room to make it cheaper. One such way may be to use a structured light transformation technique similar to Kinect, but speed up the camera a bit and modulate the output to a known signal (gives better interference rejection).<p>1: <a href=""http://piotr.nikiel.info/?page_id=95"" rel=""nofollow"">http://piotr.nikiel.info/?page_id=95</a>",1410202902

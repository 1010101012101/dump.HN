Fwiw, I didn't even ding your karma down.<p>Yes, any community will inevitably be filled with a few neighbors with lawn-mowers going off in the middle of the night, but it's worth a gentle reminder. Heck, yes this may very much be off topic (to you and some others), but you have to also realize that the community shapes up the discussions. In this very thread, there are discussions about how this could be done interactively and even some examples at that too.<p>And before I upvote or downvote, I look at the username, their recent actions and their karma level. I saw the post user's profile and learned that the user is new to this community and let it slide, for hey we were all noobs once here and have probably done some off-topic things.<p>""people will keep submitting crap."" Oh yes, they will! But, don't worry, HN is a pretty good community as a whole at smelling out B.S. :-)",1271584340

1274607,comment,1274544,1274544,0,0,moe,,,"As someone who has had to maintain a midsized openldap setup I can only agree wholeheartly: The day the LDAP dinosaur dies will be a happy day.<p>LDIF is sort of bearable once you found proper tooling (ldapvi!) and overall the whole thing looks quite sensible and usable at first. For a few minutes. Right after installing slapd and adding your first organizationalPerson.<p>A few hours later, after wiring up a few applications, things will unfortunately have changed for the worse. Your schema is now cluttered with insane amounts of cruft and redundancy, because every application that supports LDAP (which is not the most common feat in first place) seems to have a slightly different idea of what your schema should look like or what a good password hash is.<p>Getting to the point of true single-signon is a major undertaking. And during large parts of that journey you will feel a lot like Indiana Jones. You get to puzzle together fragments of ancient documentation while fighting off a mythologic multi-headed hound. You get to spend hours in endless dungeons of subtle incompatibilities and meaningless error messages. And if you ever get bored there's always a fair share of cryptology waiting for the inquiring archeologist, sometimes humorously declared as ""documentation"" - but usually just in the form of brief S.O.S-messages carved into a usenet stone-wall somewhere on the internet. Sometime in 1983. By some other poor soul stumbling around in a similar - but of course not compatible and long deprecated - maze.<p>Yea, lots of fun can be had with LDAP. Not.",1271584057

1274602,comment,1274591,1274591,0,0,nudge,,,"Jeez. I really don't get the fuss about this. 99% of web users probably won't even notice, except they might be pleased with the removal of the incomprehensible  (and, for years now, unnecessary for input) code in front of the part of the website address they recognise and understand.<p>And for everybody else, what exactly is the problem? Copy/paste? I'm sure that can be fixed, even if it means the user setting ""show <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a> in my address bar"" as a preference.<p>I read a lot on this and other websites about opinionated design. This is one of those things. The chrome team think this is a good idea. Some people disagree. As anyone who has ever run any kind of open source project can tell you, you can't just react to objections with ""Okay then let's switch it back"". At some point you have to actually make your own decision, weighing up the benefits against the costs, taking into account the number of people experiencing each.<p>In this case, it seems like a massive improvement for simplicity for most web users, and a trivial, surely quite easily fixed bug for an unknown percentage of the small percentage of users who would ever need or want the '<a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a> there.<p>Just my opinion. I would be interested to hear what other people think.",1271583671
1274601,comment,1273711,1274012,0,0,chipsy,,,"Part of the problem is that people are more likely to embark on careers based on the cultural imagery than on academic interest - if you have no prior knowledge of the academics behind any given subject, intrinsic attraction will not magically present itself, so decisions to seriously study any subject have to use other factors(pay, lifestyle, etc.) and the stereotyping plays into that.<p>Hence, it is the interest of society to:<p>* Properly introduce computer science(and other modern subjects) into school curricula, so that intrinsic factors can become apparent<p>* Have our artistic works give positive, progressive depictions of real people doing real work; this will push students towards more intrinsic factors.<p>* Continue developing accessible introductory material; the study process most programmers used to learn(bang your head against the wall for hours until you get it) is overly unsteady and hesitant, with most of the important conceptual imagery locked deep within dry, reference-heavy descriptions of algorithms and data structures. This hurts our talent pool. Accessible computer science - not ""dumbed down"", but better-taught - would automatically push the demographics towards gender balance.",1271583446

It's very much possible that the iPad could get to this price range, if not even cheaper with the economies of scale for a project like OLPC. Yes, I realize OLPC needs a crank, etc. But, what's not to stop Apple from coming up with iCrank (I also believe Apple has created a new niche of developers iCranky using their iPhone OS 4.0 - but I digress).<p>Before you point out about Apple's closed platform, do think about how easy the App store is and how much more depth of interactivity and detail the iPad could bring to learning.",1271582085

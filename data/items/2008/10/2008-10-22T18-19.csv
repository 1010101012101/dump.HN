Self-update helps, but the app developer has to actually build the update.<p>There's a tradeoff here between the simplicity and reliability of OS X app bundles and the other benefits of Linux package managers where an app can just express a dependency on a library and that library will be kept up to date globally.",1224701758

People who believe the opposite (growth mindset), that your abilities are not constrained by your inborn talent, tend not to give up when things get difficult but just put more effort until they actually do manage to solve their problem.<p>So, in this sense it's actually irrelevant whether or not inborn talent is necessary, because the mere belief that it is could have negative effect on your effort.",1224699951

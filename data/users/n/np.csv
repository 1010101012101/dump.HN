The day job isn&#x27;t always fun or challenging, so I find other things to do like search and rescue and musical groups. Also tried my hand at consulting around 2000-2001, failed; tried another startup based on a GPS logger concept that never got off the ground. Would like to contribute to open source, but the aforementioned extra-curricular activities get in the way.

1402341,comment,1400959,1402017,0,0,tassl,,,"For your last sentence, I think that you have never trained track and field. While 30-40 minutes of jogging is usually done by athletes, the core training is done by series of shorter distances that you have to compete with.<p>As an example, I have been training for 400m the last years. Being a short distance (although when you reach 300m you feel that is way too long) it is basically trained by repetitions of shorter distances (150/300). And by basically I mean that sometimes there will be longer distances (specially off-season) and tempo.<p>In general, people that train for 5000, 10000m don't run 1h to train their endurance. They will do, for example, 25x400m r:30"", or shorter distances like 3000, 2000 or 1000.<p>There is no secret on that, you are using your body to run a higher pace that is used to, while running 1h will make your body be used to this slower pace and thus you will not improve your endurance.<p>If you ask me, I would say that endurance training is not worth it, and that training high intensity is better for your body.",1275595111

This would help competition as launching even a national retail operator wouldn't require anymore to invest heavily in network infrastructure as well as it would force network infrastructure operators to be more competitive because large retail operators would probably apply a lot more pressure on them to invest in their networks than individual customers.<p>This would help to get rid of the current oligopoly in mobile communication market and individual customers would win.",1275595027

1402335,comment,1401117,1401682,0,0,gjm11,,,"> I wonder if anyone has provided a suitable Hoare triple for C's for loop.<p>Basically the same as for a while loop, as given e.g. at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic</a> since (apart from the behaviour of continue)<p><pre><code>  for (inits; cond; steps) { body }
</code></pre>
and<p><pre><code>  inits;
  while (cond) { body; steps }
</code></pre>
are equivalent. And if you <i>do</i> want to deal with continue (and presumably also break) the Hoare stuff gets awfully cumbersome; you're probably better off using informal correctness proofs and writing down a lot of loop invariants.<p>Oh, all right, here's how you do it. Suppose you have the following three Hoare triples.<p><pre><code>  {P & Q0 & !cond}
  body; steps
  {P & body never invoked break or continue}

  {P & Q1 & !cond}
  body
  {P & body invoked continue}

  {P & Q2 & !cond}
  body
  {R & body invoked break}
</code></pre>
where Q0, Q1, Q2 are mutually exhaustive (but not necessarily mutually exclusive). And suppose you have<p><pre><code>  {P0}
  inits;
  {P}
</code></pre>
Then you have<p><pre><code>  {P0}
  for (inits; cond; steps) body
  {R | (P & !cond)}
</code></pre>
That's if you adopt the convention that any precondition is valid for code that doesn't terminate. Otherwise, you need to do some stuff with loop variants.<p><pre><code>  for (char * rd=str; *rd; ++rd) {
    if (*rd != remove) *str++ = *rd;
  }
  *str = '\0';
</code></pre>
We can take<p>P0: str points to a zero-terminated string. P: so does rd, rd and str point to tails of the original string, rd >= str, and what's between original_str and str consists of an appropriately crunched version of what was originally between original_str and rd. Q0,Q1,Q2: true,false,false. R: not needed.<p>We deduce that at the end of the for loop, rd points to a tail of the original string (P), it also points to a zero character (!cond), hence it points to the end of the original string. Hence what's between original_str and str consists of an appropriately crunched version of the entire original string. Hence all we need do is put on the final zero character, and we're finished.",1275595023

Though unrelated to Lean, Kathy Sierra's philosophy is similar in that it describes a ""simple"" mindset that has the potential to change the way you think about your product and business process for the rest of your days.<p>My only complaint is that there isn't a pithy catchphrase to describe it, or a larger cult evangelizing/writing about it, like Lean has.<p>When attempting to encapsulate Kathy Sierra's ideas, I often use the phrase ""customer-centric,"" but I think people misinterpret it. (That said, ""Lean"" has a similar problem, people often think it means ""budget"" or simple.)<p>People often take Customer-Centric as a value judgement, that it means <i>be nice to people</i> or something like that.  (By all means, we should be nice to people, but Customer-Centric is not about something so subjective.)<p>Just as Lean is a <i>How</i>, so is Customer-Centric.  It's basically about focusing on how your business transforms your <i>customer,</i> not your product/brand (these things get worked on of course, but in the name of results for the customer).<p>I also think that Lean and Customer-Centric are greatly compatible, and focus each other.

This is a reason that throwing more money into the Pell grant program, for example, will basically not help maintain college affordability, because schools have strong incentive to increase tuition annually, ahead of inflation. I'm trying to remember which article I read that described this problem (it might have been in the NYT), but as far as I remember it, basically: schools pick tuition by looking at what other schools charge and figuring out roughly what they can get away with. Schools have a strong disincentive to lower tuition, because their success depends almost entirely on their brand, their brand depends on their rank, and part of the US News ranking scheme looks at  $$ (spent, nominally, but that's considered to be related to the amount taken in) per student, so charging less lowers school rank. They therefore charge exactly what A) everyone else is charging and B) what they think they can convince people to pay them, and people are willing to pay <i>a lot</i> of money for the prestige associated with a particular brand. The actual sticker price of a school therefore <i>explicitly does not consider</i> the actual cost of running a school or the value that the degree will offer.",1275593192

1402212,comment,1401541,1401541,0,0,mattw,,,"Great job! I like the simple site design. It gives it almost a craigslist feel (in a good way).<p>* Drilling down into categories was a little confusing at first. It might be better if the columns were clearly defined (maybe different backgrounds or vertical borders or something). Initially when drilling down into Vintage -> Men's Clothing I completely missed the ""Handmade"" category, so when I got down to ""Pants & Trousers"" I suddenly noticed ""Handmade"" on the left, at which point it wasn't clear whether it was a separate top-level category (as it is) or whether it was a strange word-wrapping problem (like ""Pants & Trousers Handmade"").<p>* Related to this, once I arrived at ""Pants & Trousers"", it wasn't immediately apparent that there were no items in the category. (Until I actually read ""Be the first to post..."", I thought maybe I hadn't yet arrived at the leaf-level category, so I ended up clicking ""Handmade"" thinking it was maybe the word-wrap thing.) Three suggestions that might help: 1) Make the category selector variable-height so that it collapses into a single-line breadcrumb trail once I arrive at the bottom-level category; 2) Show the number of items in each category in parenthesis after the name, e.g. ""Pants & Trousers (0)""; 3) Clearly mark the items for sale (maybe ""Items for Sale in Pants & Trousers:"" or something).<p>* One question that immediately popped into my mind as a hypothetical vendor with a large dose of cynicism was: How do you guys make any money? After digging (and of course your post here) I found a statement that ""This website was made with love to provide a free venue for artists and vendors to sell their wares"", but maybe you want to consider proactively answering the question ""If you don't take any fees, how do you make money?"" Else I'm left wondering whether there's some kind of hidden scheme going on, or whether your venue is going to survive (and thus make it worthwhile for me to set up a store). Maybe that's just my over-healthy cynicism talking, though. :)<p>Keep up the good work!",1275592688

What if they created a chamber using a larger diameter cylinder, say 10"" larger than the pipe coming from the well head. There would be a hole in the bottom which is exactly the outside diameter of the broken pipe on the well head. The top of the chamber is left open at this point. The chamber is placed over the well head and welded into place while the oil continues to spew out the open top. The top of the chamber would have braces welded to it which would act sort of like drawer glides. An example would be like how the top of a cigar box slides into grooves cut in the sides. These braces would act like the grooves in the cigar box. But obviously with a lot more surface area to hold the pressure of the flow.A top could be slid into place, cutting off the oil flow and held there by the braces. The top is then welded or bolted to the chamber. The top could have a pipe with a valve installed that would connect to the ship above to capture the oil while the valve would control the flow.

Then it expects a response from the server with the value md5(challenge).<p>That does indeed get rid of a class of cross protocol attacks, but it's a ridiculous edge case as far as I can see.<p>Previously you may have been able to find some server (non HTTP), that you could connect to, somehow get it to respond with the correct HTTP headers in exactly the right order, and continue. Then exploit it - send spam email, etc etc<p>That's pretty unlikely.<p>Now, you'd have to get that server to respond with the md5 response, which is fairly impossible.<p>BUT.

For example see the recent exploit against freenode earlier this year, where they allowed connections from an automated HTTP POST in the Firefox browser - the ircd just ignored any HTTP stuff and happily connected users to spam away. The fix wasn't to update the HTTP protocol or firefox, it was to patch the ircd so it actually checks what protocol the client is speaking (And also PING/PONG checks etc)<p>So, your premise that the original spec is somehow insecure to use within a browser->webserver context, is completely incorrect.",1275592231

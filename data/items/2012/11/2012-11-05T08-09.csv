I don't know about this particular case, but it makes a lot of sense to me that many people who seem to be in perfect health, might not be. Today, the extent of checking up on yourself is mostly taking a blood sample, talking to a doctor, etc. And it's not done that often, either.<p>In pg's future world, people would check themselves out several times a year (maybe more), with machines that catch many of the most basic problems. In fact, I'd wager that one of the most promising avenues for advancing humanity is to develop better, more affordable tests to check for common problems that we can cure with some foresight.",1352105895

While I don't know specifically his change of behavior there are more widely known cases to discuss.<p>For example Soviet Union and East Germany. I can tell you that the behavior of people was different, especially on the phone where part of the surveillance took place. Youth, being mostly ignorant about that  in some cases got their parents in trouble which in turn affected parents' behavior at home.<p>I think the takeaway from these and other cases is that public's change of behavior is function of security services' activities (corrupt or not). All it takes is several known cases of visits from the authorities about things one said over the voip or im conversation. Or the authorities pressuring their catch for money or cooperation in unrelated case to 'help them out'.<p>I also think this directly affects how free we feel.

4589176,comment,4588147,4588147,2,0,jfaucett,,,"You asked frontend or backend so I'll give you my answer, but this just comes from my personal experience over the past 10 years as a software developer, nonetheless I think its fairly true for the industry at large and will be for some time to come. The short of it - do backend.  Why? Basically, if you know Software Design patterns, Java, C(++), a server side scripting language or two like Ruby or PHP, in tandem with some Frameworks, you can always get a Job - at least in my experience. I've lived and worked on several continents (US, South America, Europe) making software and its always been very easy for me to get a Job (my language skillset is C/C++/Java, Ruby/Jruby, and Javascript). I have collegues and friends that are frontend/UI designers and though they also always tend to be able to find jobs its not as easy because the demand is lower.<p>To go about learning ""backend"" I'd say start with c and java. Knowing c will force you to understand how your computer works at a very low level, and java will give you a solid understanding of object orientied programming and software design patterns. Stick with javascript too, because its only getting more important and you can do both Backend and frontend with it - also for someone starting out I think its a really easy language. I wouldn't say learn such and such framework, just read lots of source code and build you own apps, and make sure you're having fun and know you'll always keep learning.<p>Lots of luck!",1348912621

Putting CO2 in the water moves the problem from having it in the atmosphere elsewhere, but it's still a problem.

But it doesn't make Tesla cars a folly so much as put a strong constraint on their long term economic viability: the invention of fusion power or some other method of making energy abundant turned to making hydrocarbons effectively renewable. But that could be decades away, timeline of practical viability is effectively unknown. Considering how speculative this notion of really cheap energy is (for now), I still think Tesla is a good bet. On the event of the floor dropping off the prices in energy markets, there will be few that are dependent on large energy barriers to entry that will emerge unscathed.<p>It is also effectively win-win. If such a thing becomes possible the costs in much of production will cut very drastically and the potential of things now open would be just incredible.

I think this guy seriously underestimates how disconnected everyday people are with tech. Everyday people don&#x27;t understand the point of installing Linux when they have Windows. However when shipped on devices out of the box people don&#x27;t need to question the purpose. (Take android&#x27;s success as the key example of this.) Even Linus addresses this as the key problem with Linux&#x27;s market share (or lack therefore of).",1381625987

My wife is a SAHM, and so far I haven&#x27;t had any negative comments about it, but would feel exactly the same as you do if/when I do run into the same situation.  Can&#x27;t say the same when it comes to comments regarding our parenting choice, but that&#x27;s a different matter altogether.  People love to be &#x27;right&#x27; (and come off as horribly judgmental) when it comes to certain topics, parenting being one of the worst.  I&#x27;ve gotten good at comebacks to those kinds of people.",1381625987

For example, I just read an article about creating a bootable USB copy of OS X Mavericks.  I bookmarked it as a reminder for when Mavericks comes out.  That&#x27;s a bookmark I&#x27;m going to need exactly once in the future and that should be destroyed as soon as I act on it.",1381625947
6541020,comment,6539649,6540333,2,0,olex,,,"A simple DJI Phantom will easily get to that altitude. Slight modifications would be required - possibly a different receiver and remote control to ensure the range, and an FPV system (camera and transmitter on the copter, and a receiver with a screen or video goggles on the ground). Altogether easily done in under $1000.<p>Control is real-time, just like any other flying model aircraft or multirotor. For flying at that altitude, I&#x27;d use FPV - meaning you&#x27;d fly using the camera image to pilot the copter viewed through a screen or even better, video goggles, as opposed to looking at the model from the ground.<p>Be aware though that at this altitude, you&#x27;re often in controlled airspace, which is troublesome for model aircraft in most cases.",1381625928

I&#x27;ve spent lots of time and worked in lots of countries here including Vietnam, Thailand, Philipines, Singapore, India and obviously Malaysia.<p>In Asia a work visa is intended for foreigners working for locally incorporated companies.  Regardless of what it says on the websites, if you have a tourist visa you are free to startup / bootstrap your new enterprise.  If your coding up a new website, hosting it on Amazon and serving customers over the internet your not really doing business and the country your living and honestly no body cares.  It&#x27;s cool.<p>If you want to start selling to locals, offering consultancy services to locals then yes you should probably get a visa.  But of course you don&#x27;t need the visa until you are actually doing that.<p>People who quote websites stating &quot;facts&quot; about visa&#x27;s in SE Asia obviously don&#x27;t know how the law works in SE Asia.  In SE Asia the law is a guideline and your clout / how you treat people is much more important than the words written on the page, when it comes to the courts and the interpretation of the law.<p>So if you want to bootstrap in Asia, chillax and just do it.  If your too worried about it, your probably won&#x27;t adjust well anyways.",1381625859

And easier with luggage.  And since I seem to often need to be on a flight when BART is still closed, I either drive/park or drive now basically all the time.<p>The problem is the car isn&#x27;t really very big, is heavy due to batteries and compromises, and if I drive it at all aggressively like my personal car, I can make it go sideways.<p>80 miles range and slow charging means it is basically SF-Oakland-Berkeley only, or maybe SF to Palo Alto and back.  I burned 50% just driving downtown Oakland to ups depot in downtown SF to SFO, with 15 minutes of idling at UPS, somehow.<p>If someone did this with a better car, like a Tesla, I&#x27;d be all over it.",1381625777

While it is true that services such as the police are underfunded, I think this is also used as a pretext to enable unresponsive, bureaucratic behavior on the part of the legal and law enforcement systems.

SF is only part of the Bay Area.<p>Despite what mchannon and deadfall say, the concentration of startups in SF, versus other areas in the Bay Area, actually does not have to do with money. SF is actually relatively far from venture capital than other places in Silicon Valley. Most venture capital firms are based out of the peninsula (1 hour south of SF), in suburbian cities like Mountain View (YC and 500 Startups), Palo Alto, and Menlo Park (pretty much every VC firm, like KPCB, Sequoia, A16z, Greylock).<p>Most people live in SF because 1) Young engineers/designers/others prefer living there, and 2) the density of startups/entrepreneurship is greater. The chances of you serendipitously running into someone &quot;useful&quot; is much higher - the sheer quantity of networking events, technology events, social events, etc. is mind-boggling.

My replies in the article seem to come across as dismissive of the potential downsides to civic crowdfunding. That couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth - As team members here at Crowdtilt would tell you, I have actually been quite introspective about how our tools are being used within the realm of community fundraising in the last few days (and as this use case for private security has begun to spread to other cities).<p>Our tools and platform are built with democratization in mind, not built to further tech elitism or affluent disparity. Like any tool built to connect people (from ships, to the automobile, to the internet itself) the early adoption may be through a more affluent class, but that is not where the impact stays and remains - and its introduction is an undeniable net positive for society. Additionally, knowing that many (more affluent) neighborhoods have been doing things like this for years with homeowners associations to hire private security, we hope this tool continues to lower the barriers for such solutions to problems as dire as security or as aspirational as something like free public wifi for a city (<a href=""http://tilt.tc/TP07"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tilt.tc/TP07</a>) that we&#x27;ve seen on the other end of the spectrum of civic crowdfunding.<p>My view is that communities will benefit from the tools we&#x27;re building, but again, I want it to be clear that we take the potential downsides of civic crowdfunding seriously and think about ways to mitigate those downsides - we/I am not dismissive of these arguments whatsoever.<p>Please feel free to reach me at jamesb@crowdtilt.com if you have any suggestions or thoughts - would be happy to have a dialogue on the topic with anyone (...I would learn more from that than a one-sided internal monologue with myself or our team).

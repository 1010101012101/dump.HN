8223854,comment,8222640,8223704,3,0,tosh,,,"> My takeaway is this: Doing something quick and dirty for a first draft and improve it later on often leads to better results in the long run than planing and over-engineering a solution beforehand, because you can start refining details much earlier or throw away bad approaches without investing too much time.<p>I like Dart because it supports what you&#x27;ve described really really well. Optional type annotations enable you to don&#x27;t worry about types when you do rapid prototyping.<p>Once your understanding of a good solution solidifies you can sprinkle type annotations over function signatures and wherever it makes sense to get great tooling support and to fortify core parts of your code base :)<p>In a nutshell it enables project lifecycles many companies go through many times (something written in Ruby eventually might have to be rewritten in Java for performance and tooling/collaboration support) yet being able to stick to one language which removes a ton of complexity.",1408996774

It is surprising how many things you can change (within limits) if you stop accepting things because they are, make up your mind about your limits (within agreed boundaries) and politely but firmly stick to them. Usually, if you explain your point of view politely, calmly and with confidence you can get pretty good results out of negotiations if you set realistic goals.<p>Of course, some people enjoy working long hours but in this case I would not describe their status as &#x27;caged&#x27;.",1408996552

It&#x27;s not just integer variables (and other data) which &quot;look&quot; like pointers.<p>Here is the scenario: a local variable in the C program holds the only pointer to a heap object. The object is no longer needed, so the program overwrites it with NULL. Now it is garbage, right? Wrong! The C compiler is optimizing, and has no clue about garbage collection (unlike, say, a proper Lisp compiler). The C compiler performs a data flow analysis and comes to conclusion that &quot;ptr = NULL&quot; is a dead assignment because the variable has no &quot;next use&quot; in the program graph. The assignment is optimized away, and so a memory location, or a register, continue pointing to the object.   Sometimes this happens in some top-level function, and so during some long-lived execution of lower level functions, memory is occupied. Only if you&#x27;re lucky, the memory location or register get reused for something else and so the stale pointer is overwritten.<p>If you&#x27;re using infinite lazy lists, and are counting on the prefix of these lists to be garbage-collected, as you extend the tail, spurious retention of the list head is the kiss of death to your program.",1408996461

And of course, it cascades through any false pointers in any pinned memory blocks, and so on.<p>In D 1.0, the garbage collector now remembers whether any memory block contains any pointers or not. So, now it can tell whether any memory address either definitely contains no pointers, or may contain pointers. Even so, memory leaks due to false pointers on 32-bit are not unheard of. For personal use, I&#x27;ve had to write a tool to diagnose these memory leaks: <a href=""https://github.com/CyberShadow/Diamond"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/CyberShadow/Diamond</a><p>Rainer Schuetze is working on improving the precision of the GC from one heap allocation block to one machine word, but there&#x27;s still work to be done on this.",1408996312

If there are a multiple highly qualified candidates for a job it may take 1-2 weeks to get back to you, we naturally want to interview everyone first and then make a decision.<p>If we encounter a situation where multiple candidates that we want to hire and extra head count exists we may try to hire both, or try to give one of them to another team who does have head count.<p>The overall idea here is that Microsoft wants to say hire to all exceptional candidates that come our way.<p>For the majority of interviews however, we can get back to the candidate within a couple of days.<p>(FWIW I&#x27;ve had the exact same turn around interviewing at Amazon.)<p>Now part of this is being Microsoft does not have Hiring Committees. This is both good and bad. Some teams do not have a consistent bar for hiring, and MS&#x27;s interview training class just goes over what we legally are not allowed to say.<p>The good aspect is that we can be more agile hiring people, and our interview process varies based on teams needs. While we want to always hire with an eye towards future potential and growth, different teams and orgs need different skill sets. A hardware team may want its software engineers to know how to communicate with EEs and Mechanical\nEngineers, and future growth in that org means being able to stretch across multiple disciplines. In contrast, Azure is going to look more at how well a Dev can live in the world of ops, DB, and their understanding of large scale computing.<p>The downside is, as mentioned above, that some teams don&#x27;t hold the same bar on candidates.<p>Now all this said, I have of course seen MS disqualify very highly qualified candidates for asinine reasons, again this is due to there not being a standardized hiring process.",1408995796

It was maybe a few weeks from my initial interview to an offer. I delayed my interview so I could study and had a waiting period after offer before I started due to visa, but the core hiring process was just a few weeks.<p>Talking with others internally about their experience, it was all pretty similar. No one I know internally suffered through their hiring process.<p>It does seem to be the case that we sometimes don&#x27;t do a good job of properly rejecting candidates who didn&#x27;t make the cut, but there are so many factors that go into these things it&#x27;s impossible to take a face value a one sided view.<p>My advice for anyone who does want to work for Google is that you shouldn&#x27;t, if possible, parallelize your Google application with any other companies.

And most important: People are entertained by the commentary from the streamer.<p>If you just run a game with no commentary you will be hard pressed to get any viewers.  It is more that with the younger generation games have become a huge part of culture and to see someone playing games you play as well and chatting give the viewer a social experience.  There is chat too and the streamers often address people in chat. If you look at the most popular personalities on YouTube many of them are gaming related.

That said, watching someone play Fallout definitely isn&#x27;t what gamers think of when you mention &quot;eSports&quot; - generally eSports refers to some level of competition, which is why real time strategy games and first person shooters are so popular - both require a lot of skill and knowledge of the game to be good at.<p>Getting back to the &quot;Official Video Game Olympics&quot; - there are actually some pretty serious competitions out there. Certain game developers have been known to self-host their own tournaments for millions of dollars in prizes (League of Legends and Call of Duty being two examples). There&#x27;s also plenty of companies making a profitable business out of running these tournaments: ESL in Europe and Major League Gaming in the US being two of the bigger names out there right now. So in fact, the competition and prizes are very real, so anyone interested in a game may be interested in seeing who&#x27;s going to win $1,000,000.",1408994413

League Manager had no clear project or product management leadership. After four months of 60h weeks, most working 7 days, we ended up in a late-August crapstorm when we launched an incredibly buggy product.  Things stabilized in about week three of the NFL season and I took the next three weeks off to recover, telling myself that the Christmas bonus would be worth sacrificing my time, energy, health, and relationships.<p>My key lessons:<p>0. My bonus was $1500.  Not only was it not worth it, it was a slap in the face.<p>1. No death march projects like that ever again.<p>2. The opportunity cost to work on a project like that wasn&#x27;t worth it, given the tiny rewards.

There are drawbacks to that approach, including many of the same limitations to WYSIWYG HTML/CSS tools (which I guess is a special kind of GUI development).<p>One way to improve the situation is to allow for more compile-time and/or runtime dependency injection in C++ code. It&#x27;s not a silver bullet, but it&#x27;s a tried-and-true model for other kinds of frameworks in various languages. In other words, why don&#x27;t we see a Sinatra or a Spring in C++ land? Some people may think this is a feature, not a bug, but I submit the lack of those types of frameworks is due to a limitation of the language, not a lack of interest.<p>To get to the point of C++ GUI frameworks, however, some basic building blocks are needed. Especially of note are reflection mechanisms. For example, attributes on types, functions, and objects that can be inspected in code (constexpr or not).<p>This is a fairly involved subject worthy of a series of blog posts (with examples) instead of a single comment in a comment thread. But I hope I got the general idea across.",1408994069

Bezos controls enough of Amazon&#x27;s stock - roughly three times the next largest investor - it would be difficult to spar with him, short of the stock truly plunging (something like a 75% drop from here might do it). The Bezos family controls roughly as much stock as the next five largest owners combined.<p>The correct answer is: so long as Amazon&#x27;s sales continue to grow at ... 15% to 25% per year, and the losses do not become life threatening again, the drums will never get loud enough to disrupt what Bezos wants to do.<p>I expect with a $100b +/- market cap, Amazon can continue to function without much external concern for quite some time. $100b or so mostly keeps them out of range of someone trying to buy them, and will enable continued acquisitions as needed, while not bashing shareholders too much on the downside such that everyone turns against Bezos. I see no reason they can&#x27;t maintain that perpetually with zero profits, if sales continue to grow, given the sales scale they&#x27;re likely to reach in the next decade. They will be given a serious sales multiple so long as sales keep growing relatively quickly. Investors will focus on that and be placated by the kool-aid. When sales growth stops, investors will shift to demanding profits and dividends.<p>There would have to be some catastrophic setbacks, big losses, and a pause in sales growth, to force Bezos into changing his approach. I suspect at that point he would step aside and become just chairman.<p>However, keep in mind, Amazon would <i>love</i> to have a cash cow.

I have noticed lately how this can influence API design, down to things as simple as this:<p><pre><code>    void        latin9_to_utf8(      std::string& latin9str);\n    std::string latin9_to_utf8(const std::string& latin9str);\n</code></pre>\nThe first interface is a design mistake: it encourages side effects, and requires more code to use in practice.  But it is also a very natural one: you want to convert strings, so you write a function that converts strings (KISS).  The second interface is better, but more convoluted: instead of just converting strings, it <i>returns</i> converted strings.<p>Guess which ended up in a real program I worked on…",1408993437

They are both quite wrong, in the sense that neither theory withstands the scrutiny of research over the past 50 years in anthropology, psychology, and [computational] linguistics. \nPinker is one of the more prominent critics of Chomsky, who also points out the value of some of his ideas.<p>In stark contrast, Darwin&#x27;s theory remains largely intact, with some modifications and additional insights. It&#x27;s been magnificently confirmed by discoveries in genetics, of which Darwin could have known nothing. Darwin was right and created a successful theory that will live forever, even as it&#x27;s added to and enhanced. We have nothing like that for a theory of language acquisition, neither from Chomsky, Skinner, nor anyone else, yet.

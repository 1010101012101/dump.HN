Though iirc, you can't currently use both cores in Linux. Freescale have announced the imx6 which should have quad, dual and single cores but availability won't be until q4 (though they are pushing hard to get it before then I think.)  You still are currently limited with ram on an ARM machine which I think is the biggest hinderance to going in to servers. Presently almost all server software works on an ARM machine with a few exceptions like spidermonkey (so no running Launchpad) but plenty of people use them as personal servers.",1302205065

Imagine if they can reduce that by say 20%<p>The biggest take away I have in looking at this information is the POE LED Lighting. I am really interested in this because of the impact it has on the overall electrical infrastructure in a large building.<p>Currently, you design your infrastructure so that you have emergency power backing your MPOE, DC and IDFs. This means that the more POE devices you have off the IDF, when utility power goes out, your supporting those devices via the UPS/generator infrastructure.<p>If you add lighting to this, its going to redistribute costs from the electrical/infrastructure expense to install and power the lighting, to adding a port on the switch and the requisite load on the IT side. I assume that the wattage per lumins could be less - and the overall cost of emergency lighting could be reduced in a very large facility.<p>This is right in line with the idea of ""Technology is a utility"" -- the number of devices and range of services we now hang off the network is amazing - lighting is just another example, and this will ultimately simplify and reduce the wiring infrastructure in your building.",1302204926

Phusion Passenger is currently the most popular production server for Ruby web apps (see ruby-toolbox.com and the last NewRelic survey). Phusion Passenger Standalone is practically the same as Phusion Passenger for Nginx. It's a good thing to have the development environment match the production environment as much as possible. Phusion Passenger actually comes in 3 editions: Phusion Passenger for Apache (integrates into Apache), Phusion Passenger for Nginx (integrates into Nginx) and Phusion Passenger Standalone (can run by itself, does not require an external web server).<p>2. Because Standalone is based on an Nginx core it's even fit for production. According to the Pow website it uses Nack, which according to its website is not ready for production. If 'passenger start' works for you locally then you can run the same thing in production.

The only thing they care about is whether you can help them solve their problems. If you do that consistently, you'll be fine.<p>* More work =/= more quality output; in fact I'd argue that after a certain amount of work, it is an inverse relationship.<p>* Find ways to solve more with less: write less code and still have features. Have fewer servers and still handle the traffic. Work less and still get things done. It's incredibly empowering.<p>* Knowledge, experience and honed intuition more than compensates for fewer hours of work. My suspicion is that a lot the extra work performed at startups is needed because of inexperience. I worked at a very early stage startup and it seems that a lot effort was spent on getting systems to work as they were supposed to (usually bleeding edge systems).

They would say stuff like 'if you can show us our monthly labour costs, then we'll start using it'. But they weren't able to get monthly labour costs the way they used excel, so an online solution would have been better. Another request was holiday scheduling, which I did add, but still, no increase in usage. It was excuse after excuse, so I clearly think this is an area where people recognize a pain, but don't seem to care enough about it.<p>Along with that, my heart was not really in it (I was convinced to build it after mentioning to a friend that it was crazy how businesses were still scheduling with excel and paper, etc.etc.).<p>The problems aren't technical. There are LOTS of scheduling sites. I hadn't seen any of quality until I built mine, and then saw shiftplanning. Your site looks pretty good, but schedulers should be able to select a shift, rather than entering a time, as most businesses have standard shifts for their business, and then need the ability to just edit the time for specific cases, stuff like that.<p>In the end, I'm happy I didn't dedicate too much time to the project. Looking at the compete scores <a href=""http://siteanalytics.compete.com/schedulefly.com+shiftplanning.com+scheduleanywhere.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siteanalytics.compete.com/schedulefly.com+shiftplanni...</a>, this just doesn't seem to be an area of interest to businesses.<p>ShiftPlanning is free, and they still can't get a large number of users. The problems are multiple.<p>1) You can likely only target small businesses or branches of a larger business. I spoke to a few chains, and they all said (surprisingly) that they don't dictate an online schedule service for their outlets.<p>2) It is an add-on service option for large operations like call-centers,etc which is already offered through their pbx or other systems. One business I spoke to had an add-on which came with their ERP system.<p>3) along with the groups I mentioned already, here's another 3 <a href=""http://siteanalytics.compete.com/fendza.com+helloscheduling.com+shiftboard.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siteanalytics.compete.com/fendza.com+helloscheduling....</a>  some of these guys have been at it a long time. I'll admit that I think most of these are poorly designed, but that can't be the only problem.<p>I don't expect you to read this comment and just give-up. That would be lame.

At the same time, all the languages that I know will let me extend the syntax have relatively heavy type systems. Are there lighter weight languages that allow the same sort of syntax extensibility? Or does flexible syntax require that you be able to define new data types (and operations on those types)?<p>Basically I want the syntactic flexibility of Haskell without Haskell's type system. Is there a way to get this, or does that syntactic flexibility require the assistance of a type system?<p>Examples of languages where I know the type system can be abused to create new syntax\nHaskell, C++, Python (cf. the recent thread on the pipe operator in Python)<p>Possible examples of where syntax could be modified without a strong type system maybe:\nScheme, Forth, Common Lisp?<p>However, while I can see how to overload operators in the first list to generate new syntactic constructs, I don't know enough to know how to do it in the second list. Maybe the answer is for me to go read up on macros in Common Lisp.<p>What I would like is a language with the conceptual complexity of C, Lua or Erlang, but with the ability to create additional syntactic operators as desired.",1302203025

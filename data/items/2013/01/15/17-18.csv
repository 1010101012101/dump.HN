They're great at leveraging technology to accomplish this, but I'd say they're far from being a technology company.<p>In an ideal world I'm sure they would have created their app in-house, but it looks like outsourcing the development left them with a quality final product.

5061630,comment,5060487,5060487,2,0,Tarential,,,"I met my co-founder at the very first Ruby on Rails user group meeting I attended. His previous partner had left him high and dry with a customer and no product, so he was at the meeting looking for a technical co-founder. I didn't know RoR then, but I figured it would be a perfect chance to learn.<p>We were both wary enough not to agree to anything long term up front. It started with a simple quid pro quo 2 week contract after which we decided to test the waters further by continuing to work together unofficially. After about a month we negotiated a reverse vested stock agreement with a short cliff (already passed) that satisfied us both.<p>Version one of our product (voltagecrm.com) is nearing the end of the beta cycle and will soon be available for purchase. In the meantime we've been bootstrapping the product using a custom theme on top of an open source CRM to start building a customer base and stay profitable.<p>I think the partner I found by complete luck was better than I would have found if I'd gone searching. His skills complement mine in every way. He is a salesman, a people-person, who is willing to talk to clients, lawyers, mentors, etc. He has the proper ""better to spend $10 than waste 3 hours of your time"" attitude that I can't seem to manage. He goes out to ask current and potential customers what features they need and what problems they have with our current system. In short, he makes sure that all I have to do is write software.<p>Perhaps most importantly of all, I actually like my partner. We can sit and have lunch and talk about things besides the company without feeling uncomfortable.<p>From reading about the experiences of others, I'd say I got very lucky indeed.",1358272770

Our 4.3% income tax rate is still lower than CA's QSB credit rate.<p>EDIT: Michigan's new corporate income tax also has an alternative rate of 1.8% for Qualified Small Businesses... those with net income under $1.3 million.

Either it wont come through and theyll be disappointed, or it will come through and they will have gotten their hopes up for even more.<p>- You will be tempted to give the squeaky wheel the grease. Keep in mind that everyone wants things, but not everyone will speak up.<p>- If someone just isnt working out, you have to let them go. Remember that youre not doing it for yourself, youre doing it for everyone else on the team. They deserve a great team that works well together.<p>- People who work for you want to check in on you to see how theyre doing. Some will say it, some wont. They need to get feedback from you either way.<p>- The second person who works for you is going to have different needs from the first person who works for you.<p>- People who work for you need to know that you have their back. Sometimes this means fighting for proposals that you know will fail.<p>- The happiness and career success of another human being are now your personal responsibility.

Unfortunately, these are exactly the kinds of things that are difficult to capture in statistics, particularly the very broad statistics you're discussing.<p>It's also hard to see why decreased birthrates, delayed marriage, and delayed childbirth are bad moves. High birthrates and family formation early in life are more of an r-strategy. Moving to a K-strategy is better for the children you <i>do</i> have, which is the entire point. As a side effect, maybe young people have to find outlets other than marrying at age 16 and having babies to satisfy their sexual urges, but what's the harm in that?<p>You could plausibly say that most of the harm, in terms of single mothers, comes from the war on drugs, which affects minorities and the lower classes the most.

(Hardware requirements for PCs may slip during development, but console hardware is pretty non-negotiable.) The developer will optimize until the game runs at the required frame rate on all the targeted hardware platforms (using a profiler to identify the functions that need optimization) then no further.<p>Now, if what you really meant is, ""When is assembler actually going to be faster than pure C?"" that's a harder question. Modern C compilers are pretty smart, and most assembly hackers today start by looking at the assembly generated by a C compiler, and optimizing from there.<p>Most compilers are conservative about what optimizations they run, so there are often situations where it is safe to apply an optimization yet the compiler will not recognize it as such.

Or rather, I write compilers for mainframes and I have to say that I disagree with the top voted post.<p>Mainframes have an amazing CPU architecture that is different enough from x86 to really open your mind. Ever move 2GB of memory with 1 instruction? (Well 2 really if I'm being pedantic.) It's got what's easily the industries most complicated branch predictor, and runs at well over 5Ghz. If you're interested in that, you should check out the slides from Hot Chips. Oh right, and it's got hardware transactional memory.<p>Now I'll readily admit that using z/OS through a 3270 terminal is quite painful, and using USS through SSH isn't much better, but thankfully mainframes now run RHEL. That's right, big iron runs linux. Yes, you'll likely have to recompile your favourite software, but you can run vim, emacs, bash, zsh, and whatever else you want, and you don't even have to deal with EBCDIC.<p>As for the comment that there's no development on mainframes, well that's just plain wrong. There's a ton of development, to the point where nearly every single financial transaction you make in a day goes through a Z mainframe, and nearly all major retailers use one.<p>You just can't beat the security and stability. Can you think of another platform where you can hot swap EVERY part? Reportedly, the Z in SystemZ stands for Zero downtime, and that includes OS upgrades and hardware upgrades.<p>No, you're not going to write PHP, Ruby, or node.js on a mainframe, you're going to be using C/C++, Java, or COBOL (surprisingly good language in some cases). But you're also not falling behind technologically.<p>This might come off as preachy, but I really do enjoy working on zLinux, it's a really nice environment, and I think that young people might actually enjoy the experience of working on something that's not x86.",1358269404

You can do things like upgrade and replace processors, RAM, and disk drives without interrupting applications. And speaking of processors and RAM, modern mainframes can scale to >100 processors and terabytes of RAM in one system.<p>Yes, you can build systems with similar specs and capabilities with clusters of commodity hardware, but then you have the complexity of managing a distributed system.

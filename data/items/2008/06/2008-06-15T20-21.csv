218194,comment,217411,217411,0,0,drawkbox,,,"It doesn't matter, if you are a competent programmer you can use .NET, RoR, Python, Java, PHP or anything to make it work efficiently.  Tools do not make the system better, the people working on it do. There is 'magic' in both the systems that you mention but you should be aware of the underlying 'magic' and architect a solution that works best.  Rarely today are programmers limited by platform.  The only concern with .NET is platform lock-in but if you go with mono there is no concern.<p>You will find languages and platforms are like religions or brands, everyone has their favorite because it worked for them but it doesn't make them the best.  Just the best for them and their conditions/constraints/knowledge.",1213562724

218191,comment,211696,217968,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"The Turing Test is not an element of the singularity--it pre-exists the idea of the singularity by a sizable margin, and was an effort to define the idea of artificial intelligence.  I would certainly encourage people who wish to believe in the coming singularity to set similar concrete goals for their vision of the future.  But, even then, the idea of the singularity will not be science--although the specific, falsifiable claims might be.<p>Claims made in 1994 that the internet would change the world were not science (although some specific claims might have been)--this does not make them useless or wrong.  It isn't a scientific claim that the Mona Lisa is a good painting, or that dogs are loyal.  But most people would agree with both of these statements.<p>Most predictions (ignoring those of incredibly limited scope) about the future are unscientific.  This, by itself, does not make them false.  But trying to pretend to be science is rarely a good sign.",1213562031

I agree dont' go dark, but coding by community/design by committee can be horrible on the other extreme.<p>At a certain point projects can be ready for more collaboration, at a certain point they are too young and might get spoiled by project wreckers.  Showing incomplete code/systems to the wrong people (i.e. non programmers in many cases) can be the death of good ideas.<p>Look it up, find your favorite tool, platform, language etc, I guarantee you there is 1-3 guys that made it happen at the first iteration at least.",1213561732

Every database has its own set of features and does things in a certain way. For example, in some databases cursor operations are expensive and temporary tables are the way to go. In some, the opposite. Remaining neutral means using only the most basic SQL and <i>still</i> you might not get the expected performance...",1213561028

Before every shave, I rub the dry blades against my bicep - obviously not in the cutting direction. It keeps the blade damn sharp. Someone told me about it at a bar, I tried it, and so far I haven&#x27;t had a shave that&#x27;s made me think about changing blades.",1397959181

Many are underexposed, poorly composed & out of focus. Also some of those sites ask for an email address so they can spam me with few pics they select every week. I just want to find a pic today that I want not something sent to me what someone else wants. Just awful.<p>Having been an istockphoto photographer/contributor since 2005, I can tell you that to be an istockphoto or getty photographer/contributor the bar is high. You need to pass a photography test and every photo uploaded is scrutinized by pros so it doesn&#x27;t suck. So that it&#x27;s exposure, framing, quality etc is top notch. Therefore guaranteeing quality at a price.<p>If you want free photos, you have a better chance of finding ok photos on flickr. When you find one you like contact the photographer and ask if you can use their photo giving them credit on your site. Just be careful with faces in a photo. Sites like istockphoto force all photographers to sign a Model Release form which means no surprises for the people appearing in a photo.",1397959097
7615485,comment,7615273,7615273,3,0,e12e,,,"I think the author is a little disingenuous with the term &quot;security theatre&quot;. Basically he argues that OCSP doesn&#x27;t work because hard fail might cause DOS -- but fails to conclude that without OCSP SSL/TLS <i>is useless</i>. It&#x27;s a long argument for saying that the CA system is broken (you can only trust the white-list chrome provides) -- and the sensible conclusion is that <i>you cannot trust any other certificate chains</i> (without OCSP) is left out.<p>Without certificates, SSL/TLS falls apart.<p>Perhaps a better use of CAs would be to always delegate authority to the domain owner -- we&#x27;d only need OCSP for the CAs, and domain owners could issue hour/day-valid certs via a cert infrastructure. That would push a lot of complexity down to domain owners, it would probably lead to a lot of errors in implementation -- but those errors would only affect the domains -- not the main CA trust chain as such.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if that would be an improvement or not -- but at least you could know that if a domain was run correctly, a valid certificate could actually be trusted...",1397959085

Langley (the author) mentions short-lived certificates (either rapid expiration or via a &#x27;must staple&#x27;)... how soon can we enforce that? How short can that make the danger-period where the CA, and Google, and the &quot;connected web&quot; all know that a certificate is invalid, but a user-at-risk does not?<p>Why not other ways to rapid-broadcast invalidity in censorship-proof ways, so that a browser encircled by an enemy can quickly figure out something&#x27;s wrong?

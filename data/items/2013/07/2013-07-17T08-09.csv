To me this seems like some sort of culture clash and in my opinion staying silent is the wrong way to go about this.<p>If I notice someone getting offended by my profanity I just tell them that they were not the target of that profanity and that I have no &#x27;beef&#x27; with them. I haven&#x27;t <i>ever</i> met anyone with whom this was a problem. I usually make a pretty good case for open communication, depending on sobriety of course. ;)<p><i>I believe the onus is entirely on the guy who is trying to be charming (if that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re talking about, as opposed to simple catcalling sorts of harassment) to notice when the object of his wit does not reciprocate with a smile and a kind word and to move the fuck on before his behavior gets creepy. I suppose I&#x27;m agreeing with you, as not smiling is a pretty clear form of communication - no rings or shirts or pepper spray are required.</i><p>I think the point of the &quot;getting hit on all the time sucks&quot;-argument for anti-discrimination rules was that even if all the guys who hit on a girl stop it after (instantly) seeing that she isn&#x27;t interested it would still be a lot of input which &quot;sucks&quot;. So the case many people skeptic of anti-discriminatory rules saw was that a girl gets hit on all the time and even if they all do so in a civil manner, the one unlucky guy who represents the &#x27;final straw&#x27; to that girl then gets kicked out. The examples I put up for showing that you&#x27;re not interesting were aimed at communicating that <i>before</i> you get hit on. A rough analogue for this might be a spam filter - You don&#x27;t have to manually decide whether or not something is spam by reading it, you don&#x27;t have to read it in the first place. :P<p>Harassment is obviously a reason to warn somebody or - if they repeatedly harass someone - kick them out of the event. That said, I think &#x27;catcalling&#x27; is <i>very</i> nuanced, couples or people who know each other for $random_reason can catcall each other in play and fun, you can also do it in a sarcastic/parodic fashion etc. The only thing I&#x27;d generalize about catcalling is that you probably shouldn&#x27;t do it to someone you don&#x27;t know (and of course not to someone of whom you <i>know</i> that they don&#x27;t like it).<p>But in general I think pretty much everything I said here can be succinctly shortened to &quot;Be merry, have fun and if you feel there&#x27;s a problem - <i>talk about it</i> - just don&#x27;t do it behind someone&#x27;s back.&quot;",1374051297

6056763,comment,6054268,6055659,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Realistically I&#x27;d have to consider myself pretty close to an expert in TFS, although I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a ton I don&#x27;t know about it.<p>Overall, TFS, as a source control system, is pretty decent, definitely in the top few of the best source control systems out there. However, it has a lot of downsides. It&#x27;s a serious pain to administrate, and an even bigger pain to initially set up. It has a huge number of &quot;quirks&quot; that are really just misfeatures or defects for most users. For example, binary files are exclusive checkout by default (meaning only one workspace can have a specific binary file editable at any given time) which seems like a good idea naively but tends to bite you in the ass almost always in any real-world example. And most TF admins aren&#x27;t smart enough to know how to change the setting for it, as far as I&#x27;ve seen anyway. Also, access control is like pulling teeth, you&#x27;d think it should be easy-peasy given that it&#x27;s all GUI based and what-not but it&#x27;s crazy. Similarly, things like triggers can work in completely non-intuitive ways that are really easy for, say, a moderately trained dev who&#x27;s trying to be a part-time admin to screw up in ways that impact a huge amount of people very quickly (which I&#x27;ve seen happen routinely).<p>There are some nifty features, like shelvesets, and it supports a reasonable branching model with a reasonably decent merging system, though if you use it long enough you&#x27;ll probably eventually run into one or another nightmare scenario that takes a long time to figure out.<p>For most projects I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it over, say, git + github/gitlab or other free source control options. The one advantage that TFS has is that it&#x27;s far more capable of handling extremely large code bases (e.g. hundreds of gigabytes of data, millions of files) as long as it&#x27;s configured well, whereas git will pretty much just choke.<p>Also, the Visual Studio integration of TFS is pretty good, so if you use that as your primary IDE TFS will have a moderate advantage in ease of use. Of course all of this scales to how skilled you are with using source control at a low level anyway. If you&#x27;re a dev who has zero interest in learning anything more than &quot;checkout/checkin&quot; and you hope that merges and branching and whatnot are handled by people who are not you then TFS is pretty much right at your level, it&#x27;s definitely super easy to use for those common cases.",1374051274

6056733,comment,6054268,6055659,3,0,sirmarksalot,,,"My experience is limited, but the source control aspect of TFS seems really crude compared to git. Branching is about as hard as an old-school Perforce or CVS repository, but without the flexibility in managing your local changes that those systems allow. It only lets you keep one changeset active at a time, which can be hacked around using shelvesets, but not without occasional hiccups (TF Power Tools are often the only way to recover your work after particular kinds of operations).<p>I&#x27;ve found that every workflow I can come up with is &quot;wrong&quot; in some way, but none of the documentation tells me what the &quot;right&quot; way is. Git may have been in a similar place when it was first released, but nowadays there are plenty of good tutorials that walk you through the way to think about it.<p>The GUI is clunky and requires lots of clicks to perform routine tasks. For example, to view a file&#x27;s history, you need to open each changeset individually and diff the file in each one. The command line is no better, and makes heavy use of the &quot;observe something to initialize it&quot; anti-pattern.<p>The main draw seems to be its integration with issue tracking, unit tests, code reviews and project management. It&#x27;s trying to be a one-stop shop for everything, but the problem is that each feature has a better stand-alone equivalent. So you either lose the synergy of having one tool for everything, or you sacrifice the features that you really want from your favorite source repository, code review tool, diff utility and bug trackers.<p>This has become quite a rant, but I&#x27;d really like to hear a good explanation for some of these things, or at least somebody to tell me what I&#x27;m doing wrong. The worst is when somebody knowingly says &quot;come on, it&#x27;s not that bad&quot; without actually offering a more functional workflow.",1374050262

That&#x27;s the heroku business model (with all the deployment sugar on top of it, of course), and I&#x27;m always surprised people are ok to pay that much to rent processes.<p>Of course, one could argue you can spawn multiple processes in a dyno. But 1. thoses processes have to consume very low memory because of low memory limits of dynos and 2. this could lead to boot up nightmare.<p>Before the &quot;rap-genuis-gate&quot;, the company I worked for then had scalability issues with heroku, being the later described router random timeout problem. Our dyno costs were already very high, even when using hirefire, so adding more dynos sounds not a good option.<p>We tried to replace thin with unicorn, which was later the proposed solution from heroku. But even with two unicorn workers, we reached memory limits. Even worse : when dyno booted unicorn master process, it considered itself ready, while unicorn was still spawning its children, so it ends up with more failed requests.<p>Bottom line is : using (and paying for) a heroku dyno is basically the same as using a process on a dedicated server. That may not be a problem, provided heroku clients are aware of that, and are not sold dynos as if it was what we all know as virtual servers.",1374049995

That&#x27;s now my new business and I try to optimize so that at least 80% of the work is something I enjoy doing (and try to outsource anything that I don&#x27;t!)<p>Without that initial runway, however, I&#x27;d never have done it and this idea of having some extended time off or having a healthy pillow of cash to cushion a potential fall seems to be a common element of many stories like this.",1374048298

6056640,comment,6053113,6054560,9,0,pif,,,"> In 1986, SCRUM consisted of choosing an elite team of experts, throwing them into a room, and telling them to solve a problem with seemingly impossible goals.<p>I used to work in scientific research, and the concept there is exactly the same. And it works, I can confirm that!<p>> It kills me that almost 30 years after this was proven to work, we&#x27;re still trying to come up with new ways to differentiate existing processes.<p>The problem is, in 1986 you talked about <i>experts</i>. What people have been trying to do lately, is to apply whatever methodology to average (or sub-average) developers and expect that the methodology itself increase substantially their productivity and the quality of their work.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t work, simply because it cannot work. Buying a book on Agile/SCRUM/whatever is much cheaper than investing on the competency your team, and you simply get what you paid for!",1374048272
6056639,comment,6049253,6050830,1,0,cmccabe,,,"Let me guess.  You are coming from Java.  In Java this would be:<p><pre><code>  myArray.sort(new Comparator<MyClass> ({
    @Override
    CompareTo(MyClass lhs, MyClass rhs) {
      return rhs.compare(lhs);
    }
  }));
</code></pre>
Is that really shorter?  I don&#x27;t think so.<p>In any case, there is a more elegant solution in Go, which is simply:<p><pre><code>  sort.Sort(sort.Reverse(array))

I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to add this additional overhead.<p>The point of this is that it makes things /faster/, not /slower/. It&#x27;s essentially trading 1GB of DDR3 for 3GB of DDR1, which is a net gain when your ram amount is more of a bottleneck than ram speed (which it pretty much always is, IME)",1374048270

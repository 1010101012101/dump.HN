If you read Watsi's FAQ, all patients on the site are guaranteed funding before their profiles are posted. Thus, doctors are the only ones that decide who gets care and who doesn't, not donors.

If non-transparent giving is what you like, then that's great, there are thousands of charities to give to and I'd be happy to recommend some top ones. But there are a lot of people (myself included) that like to know who their donations are helping and how. Establishing meaningful connections between people is as much a part of Watsi's mission as simply funding medical care.<p>3. I don't think that establishing a connection between someone that needs medical care and someone that can contribute is gross. I think it is one of the most meaningful connections possible, and we establish these connections in the United States every day via TV, school fundraisers, churches, etc. (eg ""XYZ's cancer fund""). Over $20MM has been raised on giveforward.com for medical expenses by people paying a fee to use the service.<p>Watsi is a 100% opt-in program. Why should poor people be denied the same fundraising tools rich people have access to? Why should they be denied the opportunity to share their stories with the world? I've personally explained Watsi to patients in the developing world, and it's funny how the only people who ever seem put off by the model are ""wealthy Westerners"" who for some reason feel so guilty about their status in the world that they fail to see Watsi patients as other human beings and only as a ""menu of suffering third-worlders"" who should be hidden out of sight.<p>I understand where you're coming from, I just happen to disagree. I'm very happy Karmabox donated their time to try and make the world a better place, and I respect them tremendously.

You shouldn't pick some random project that you have no interest in for the sake of boosting your GitHub activity. You need to set up your project environment. You need to debug/test your patches. You need to learn and conform to the coding standards of the project you're dealing with. You need to communicate with the project team and be available.<p>All these things together require a lot of time. Great if you're single and in college or without a job.<p>OSS projects, and GitHub in particular, have an elitist stigma surrounding them these days. I don't think it was like that ten years ago.

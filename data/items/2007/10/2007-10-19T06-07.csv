(Heavy right-brainer here, apparently...)",1192775650

Given that it was Prussians who first categorized it, it might be a judgement left over from them. It's probably because it's easier, and does away with structure (shrug). Actually no, I recall it was said sort of generally, but 'weak' in the sense of lacking expressive power or something. Ach, truthfully, it's just an impression I was left with with something I read a long time ago. And it /feels/ easier, so that interpretation stuck with me. <p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic-comment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic-comment</a>",1192774712

And, even worse, his site is total Microsoft fanboy stuff. Windows, SQL Server, ASP.NET, scaling to tens of millions of users and more money per month than all YC acquisition sums.",1192774629

I think you're doing <i>raymondism</i>.<p>There is little innovation in the open source world; it's mostly about making better implementations of things invented long ago by companies or universities. But that's OK because in the end we get good software.

He said that they were meaning to pay more attention to stuff that comes in over the transom, but it sounded much like I do when I say that I want to work out more.",1192773882

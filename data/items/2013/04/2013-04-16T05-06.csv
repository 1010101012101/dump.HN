Bitcoin is effectively an artifically limited gold standard, with all of its positive and negative attributes.<p>In (very) short terms:  consider an economy with three goods:  money, bonds, and output (i.e. stuff or servcies we buy).   There's a supply and demand for all three.   Except one of them (money) has a finite supply limit.   When supply of bonds is high and demand low (such as when we've had a financial crisis and people are paying down debt), we eventually run into a case where price of bonds (i.e. their interest rates) are 0%.   That means that the price of money soars, and the price of output tanks.<p>That's called deflation, and it's really painful to the productive economy.  People sitting on money doing nothing are fine, but output falls dramatically.  The working class are wiped out in a spiral of ""making less & spending less"".

It is an abstract idea, a sort of shared culture and basic methodology.<p>Here is the real trick though, this ""New Rome"" is not a city.  We don't have a seat of power from which we derive our identity and shared culture, or any sort of sackable cultural Mecca which we define ourselves by.  You could level NYC and kill every last person in it, dismantle the government and turn dollars into papiermarks, but you would not have dismantled the society.<p>Remaining you would still have hundreds of millions of <i>Americans</i> with no invading army to eradicate them and what they beleived in.  <i>More importantly</i>, you would still <i>billions</i> of others, across the world, who would <i>continue</i> to make up bulk of our society.  The worldwide shared culture of the 21st century, of which Americans represents but a fraction.  A culture of appreciation for scientific progress, the arts, and political theories.  A collective history, solemly remembering the same wars, sharing the same accomplishments.  A Library of Alexandria that (thanks to dramatic advances in publishing and distribution since the last) cannot be burned.<p>A few well placed bombs by a few extremists who want nothing to do with any of this could never put an end to all of this.

In that sense, socialism is already employed to attempt to redistribute the benefits of progress.<p>I strongly dislike taxation though, so I want to approach the issues in terms of capitalism and the free market.<p>To do so, I think it is necessary to draw a line between young and mature markets. A young market is closer to a free market by virtue of it's low barriers to entry, high size/potential for profit, and lack of incumbent monopolies. Monopolies are a well-known and undesirable symptom of a market that has stopped changing and is not accessible to competition. I would also suggest that a heavy focus on financial derivatives over real wealth (real estate, manufacturing, durable goods, etc) would indicate an overly mature market - one that's difficult to add value to as a new entrant - and I think that's exactly what we can see today (and what's more, we bail them out to keep them going).<p>The first stages of market development are almost idyllic: new products and services are possible, and wealth can be created by adding value. In a mature market, value is difficult to create under the burden of monopolist control and market manipulation, often to the extreme of halting progress to maintain the incumbent's advantage (cornering a market, or inflicting technological restrictions like DRM, for example). By definition, the further growth of a anti-competitive monopoly is a detriment to the market, and therefore to society. There is no clear line, but sometimes we choose to intervene.<p>There are laws specifically targeting anti-competitive behavior, insider trading, etc, for example, in order to promote the early-growth period, but there are more things that could be done that are less reactionary and of broader benefit...<p>One that stands out to me is to eliminate copyright and patents, etc. I know to expect criticism on that regard in this forum, but those are exactly the sorts of monopolies that are blocking the redistribution of value and are being exploited by incumbent monopolies to the exclusion of individuals and developing business who might use them to create new value, solve real problems, and thus distribute the benefits of progress without resorting to ""socialism."" Instead we are extending copyright, and our society is becoming focused on protecting imaginary property, a situation that is analogous to letting Henry Ford have, and helping him maintain, a monopoly on the assembly line when the assembly line clearly benefited all modern businesses. It would be absurd to scale up enforcement of ""assembly line infringement."" The modern equivalent, easy copying and, dare I say, copyright infringement, clearly benefits everyone (distributing knowledge and tools), and also serves to redistribute wealth without taxation and government intervention (which has many other undesirable attributes). This is the fruit of a hundred years of effort, and what's more, it's proliferation fosters growth in conventional markets: for example, I am convinced that the early PC hardware industry boom benefited hugely from software and music proliferation (before the monopoly protectionism set in), creating wealth across the board, and the decline in hardware sale coincides with the modern crackdown on copyright infringement, destroying revenue.<p>The goal then, IMHO, is to stop protecting monopolies. Let technological, industrial, and other types of progress, be used as public resources freely and encourage every generation of growth to make the most of the resources available instead of encouraging monopolies that stop them at the gate.<p>Furthermore, by avoiding explicit intervention to begin with (by not protecting monopolies to begin with), we would avoid the trap of having to maintain the artificial balances that result that lead to cronyism, and minimize intervention.<p>Unfortunately, once an organization (government, NGO, etc) has an official reason to exist, paid positions, and a granted authority/monopoly, it is difficult to get it to relinquish it's role. In those cases, direct action may be required to escape gridlock, but the moral is still to avoid the trap in the first place.<p>As such, organizations need deliberate limitations to prevent monopoly abuse (and to prevent resorting to socialistic taxation).",1366089147

Because there's totally just one problem with our government.<p>""Slowing down the functioning of government"" is not a good thing. ""The government"" (by this I assume you mean legislation) already moves at a snail's pace. Making it go slower, so reforms and important issues take <i>even longer</i> than they already do to resolve? NOT HELPING.<p>People talk about the 'size' of 'government' like it's some kind of tangible property. Government is just the system by which our policies, actions and affairs are executed. It might be big, it might be small, it doesn't matter. It is whatever we need it to be.<p>What concerns me are the issues and how we deal with them, not some abstract idea like ""too much"" or ""not enough"" of the system. If we need to get a respectable budget planned, a ""big"" or ""small"" government will not fix that. Your budget may be smaller because your ""government"" is smaller, but that doesn't make it a good budget. Your regulations of certain businesses may be smaller, but that doesn't mean the new free reign these businesses have will result in customers being treated fairly or allowing other businesses to compete.<p>There are reason we have what we have. It's not like there's some super exponential growth formula being fed to a giant single celled organism called ""government"". There's hundreds of complex issues at hand, and your one-size-fits-all generic solution doesn't begin to address any of them. Rather it buries them under a carpet of obfuscation, waiting for the rug to be so choked by lack of observation that someone finally will throw it out for a new one.",1366089005

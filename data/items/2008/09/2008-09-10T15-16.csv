What email/calendar/to-do programs do you use?<p>I'm having trouble finding a good solution because I use both a PC and a Mac and use my iPhone's calendar extensively. So far, MobileMe seems like the best option... but I'm very hesitant of switching from free email (gmail) to a paid service (mobileme). I'm sure someone here has somewhat similar needs and I'd love to find out how you guys are handling situations such as this (and organizing yourself in general).",1221062084

news readers could give us some valuable feedback. You can access our site under http://www.iterend.com/?ref=hn 
(the link will work for the first 1000 users and you have to use this link first before the other links below will work!).<p>So what differentiates us from other blog search engines: (e.g google blog search, technorati, twingly, etc...)<p>We want you to be able to actively discover the most recent, most discussed and most important articles of the blogosphere.
Iterend gives you an overview of the information you are looking for, where you are then able to drill down into the different categories of interest related to that information.<p>* We display an overview of what is currently being discussed in the
   blogosphere, so that you are able to dive into the different areas
   you are interested in.<p>* All articles are linked to structured wikipedia information, which
   makes it possible to search by categories. (eg.
   http://blogs.iterend.com/en/?query=category%3A""Swimmer""+category%3A""Medalist""&date=alltime)<p>* Search results are clustered and you can search on sentence level,
   post level or blog level.<p>* Next to the search results, relevant phrases and categories are
   displayed, so you are able to restrict your search or get an
   overview over the information you are looking for. (eg.
   http://blogs.iterend.com/en/?query=techcrunch&date=alltime)<p>* You can search for related posts to a given topic, url or cluster
   (eg. http://blogs.iterend.com/en/?query=related%3A""iphone""&date=alltime)<p>At the moment, about 50 000 mainstream english blogs are indexed. The number of indexed blogs will be increased soon, 
while we will still focus on the mainstream (and hopefully spam free) blogs. We will add support to search in additional 
languages in the future as well.<p>We also offer an Api for application developers wishing to use parts of our service in their applications.<p>I will be very thankful for all of your comments! If someone wants to create an application out of our api (related phrases, categories, or the related search future), that would be great!",1221061193

I cannot find a more specific reference to this document. I would appreciate it if anyone who can supply this reference would let me know.</i><p>The date of this article is 1984, and by this time the aforementioned Air Force paper was effectively already lost. It saddens me to think of all of the stuff of this type we're going to have to relearn (possibly badly) because we failed to keep/retain/organize the information.<p>Archive.org retaining so much stuff and Google searching it is initially exciting, but there's so much still behind closed doors, whether they're those of the US DoD or just a simple commercial pay-to-read interface.<p>The ability to distill something as seemingly boring as a product (early/beta Multics) security review into an important and generally applicable treatise on software trust definitely earns my admiration (aside from the important obvious work that he's done on UNIX), and I would be delighted if I could ever contribute something so important to the world of Computer Science.",1221061150

C's worse case is obfuscated garbage <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Obfuscated_C_Code_Contest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Obfuscated_C_Code...</a> that just about no one could read or maintain and you think that's better that Python, PHP, Pearl, or Ruby's best case?<p>Or is it more likely that like most C folk, you're just stuck on execution speed as the only measure of a language or you don't know what maintainability actually means?<p>C's being hard to maintain is not a perception, it's a reality.  If C were easy to maintain there wouldn't have been room for scripting languages to exist, everyone would have just kept using C.  C is extremely low level and extremely powerful, making it hard to work in and very dangerous.<p>Yes you can do anything with a for loop, but I'd much rather use higher level abstractions like higher order functions, first class functions, objects, continuations, and exceptions and <i>not</i> be able to directly play with memory or pointers because I don't give a crap about the machine, I give a crap about abstracting and solving my problem with the least amount of necessary boilerplate or repetitive code.<p>Look, make it simple, assume for the sake of argument that Python and C have exactly equal execution speed under all circumstances, given that axiom, why would anyone choose C over Python?  Which language do you think most people would choose?",1221061108

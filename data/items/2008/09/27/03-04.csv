316712,comment,316171,316699,0,0,bokonist,,,"I think you're overestimating technology.  Robotics is still incredibly primitive.  There is ongoing work in automated driving ( see DARPA's grand challenge and Willow Garage) and automated cooks ( see Anybots), but all of these efforts are in the very early stages.<p>Even with car companies, I think I read somewhere that Toyota uses much less robotics than GM, and that's a reason why Toyota is more successful.  GM bought to much into the robotics, over invested, and it ended up costing more and hurting quality.  As for solar, it's still very expensive in terms of resources to build panels.",1222487162

I can't remember the country off the top of my head, but it may have been Panama.<p>As for language, it doesn't take too long to learn the basics for survival.  Plus, lots of the best countries for this have good expatriate communities.",1222487108

316701,comment,316477,316477,0,0,wheels,,,"Awesome.  I'd love to see one of these guys pull through.  I'm in one of my heavy research phases right now and there's always this cat-and-mouse information tracking problem of trying to trace an idea back to its source and track its derivations through the clunky interfaces that online journals use now.  (Especially, say, if you're not members of all or any of them.)<p>Similarly, I asked exactly the question The Economist nails of a friend of mine in academia last week (who does a lot of peer review) -- how do ideas spread at a reasonable pace through academic circles given that it often takes a year or more for a paper to be published?  The answer was, ""Everybody knows everybody.  They talk.""  Which naturally is frustrating looking from the outside in and working on theoretically intensive problems from a non-academic setting.",1222486093

316699,comment,316171,316512,0,0,songism,,,"I have a habit of overestimating the capabilities of modern technology, but I really don't understand why more of the underlying processes of our civilization aren't automated (e.g. food production, food transportation, food preparation, human transportation).<p>Maybe the problem is history. Maybe, if we were given the chance to start over and plan a brand new city from the ground up, we could eliminate a lot of unnecessary elements that currently occupy a lot of our time and energy.<p>Would it be possible -- with our current technology -- to build a giant, <i>self-sustaining</i> field of photovoltaic modules? Thousands of automated machines and robots could maintain and repair this system. Massive amounts of free power could effectively fuel a developing city.<p>And if our basic needs were taken care of, we could each start to focus on what matters to us, instead of what merely ensures our survival. I think it's about time for us humans, collectively, to move past worrying about having enough money for food and a place to live.",1222485835

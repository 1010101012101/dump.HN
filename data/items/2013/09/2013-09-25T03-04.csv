&quot;III-V compound semiconductors obtained by combining group III elements (essentially Al, Ga, In) with group V elements (essentially N, P , As, Sb). This gives us 12 possible combinations; the most important ones are probably GaAs, InP GaP and GaN.&quot; [1]<p>In other words, the materials in general are: Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Antimony, Arsenic, Bismuth, Boron, Aluminum, Gallium, Indium and Thallium.<p>I imagine nitrogen, phosphorus and aluminum are the easiest to find generally throughout the world.<p>China appears to control 90% of antimony [2] and its price seems to have gone up 700% over the last decade.<p>Arsenic seems to have major supply issues, one of the most critical in terms of scarcity according to [3] and [4].  Nevertheless, the price has gone down over the last 100 years significantly and according to this source is less scarce than it was a century ago: [5]<p>Bismuth is &quot;relatively rare&quot; but doesn&#x27;t appear to be scarce.  it is found mostly in Peru Japan Mexico, Canada, Bolivia and not in the USA.

6442531,comment,6437831,6439931,2,0,nhaehnle,,,"This is simply incorrect. Banks can and do create money when they give out loans. Unfortunately, our everyday vocabulary doesn&#x27;t contain the terminology to describe this properly, and this is how people end up confused.<p>A better intro than the link you posted is this one: <a href=""http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2011/09/mmp-blog-15-clearing-and-pyramid-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2011/09/mmp-blog-15-clear...</a><p>The crux is that there are really (at least) two types of money: Central bank money, and money used by &quot;the public&quot;. They live in two different &quot;monetary circuits&quot;, and while those circuits are not entirely unrelated, they are completely isolated from each other; money cannot go from one circuit to the other.<p>Ignoring cash for simplicity (and it is little volume anyway), central bank money is <i>only</i> the electronic currency on accounts at the central bank, and it only moves between banks and other financial institutions.<p>Money used by the public is cash in circulation as well as money on checking accounts and so on.<p>Banks cannot create central bank money, but they can and do create money in the other &quot;monetary circuit&quot;. It is true that the amount of money in the public monetary circuit must be less than the amount of central bank money times a factor (the inverse of the reserve ratio).<p>However, in practice, this limit works the other way around: When the amount of money in public use grows &quot;too large&quot;, central bank money is automatically created by the central bank (this has nothing to do with quantitative easing; it is part of the normal market operations that the central bank always performs to achieve its interest rate target). Because of this, the reserve ratio does not limit the creation of money by banks.",1380081444

6442524,comment,6438320,6441768,5,0,dgreensp,,,"I sense a fallacy lurking here.  Sure, a type system like Haskell&#x27;s or even Scala&#x27;s is magic (and can be used without understanding it) as long as it can &quot;Do What You Mean,&quot; but when it can&#x27;t, you have to understand its workings.  We can&#x27;t sweep that fact under the rug by calling any failure to &quot;Do What You Mean&quot; a bug, a wart to be fixed -- a deviation from correct DWYM behavior.  There is no actual DWYM type system, or at least no one&#x27;s ever come up with one.<p>What type system doesn&#x27;t have warts?  Haskell&#x27;s probably has both more and fewer than most, depending on how you count them, because so much emphasis is put on the type system.<p>When you use any language long enough, you end up needing to simulate pretty much every observable aspect of it yourself -- not including, for example, the garbage collector, the JVM bytecode verifier, or the GCC code optimizer, which are supposed to be transparent, but including the type inferencer, the JVM threading model, and the JavaScript semicolon insertion rules, which are not.  Some of these things you can steer clear of for a long time or even avoid forever by staying on the beaten path, but they lurk, waiting for the thousands of people who have run into bugs or compiler errors and needed to understand them.<p>I don&#x27;t know HM too well, but it seems to have more in common with the dataflow analysis algorithms in optimizers and verifiers -- which programmers don&#x27;t usually have to understand -- than the basic unidirectional type inference that already serves pretty well to reduce redundancy in the source code.",1380081234

My thermostat knows the temperature in my living room, but not upstairs by my bedroom, which can be 10F warmer or cooler, and we have to set the downstairs thermostat to odd temperatures at night just to make it remotely comfortable, and it&#x27;s rarely the same temperature from night to night.

The manner in which Congress has exercised that power since the constitution was drafted has been essentially a clone of the Statute of Anne, a British law created following years of heavy lobbying pressure by the publishing industry.  The payment of artists comes secondary; in theory, the businesses that benefit from copyrights need to gather their material from creative workers, and those workers demand payment (in practice the people who create copyrighted works get the short end of that stick).<p>&quot;Of course this is done by giving the authors exclusive rights over their work&quot;<p>You make this sound like the most obvious thing ever, yet this was not always the case.  Prior to the invention of the printing press it was common to <i>encourage</i> people to copy creative works -- to prevent them from being lost forever.  In fact, the Library of Alexandria, one of the important stores of human knowledge of its time, existed because of a law that <i>required</i> books to be copied <i>regardless of the wishes of authors</i>.<p>You brought up the progress of science, but most scientists give <i>zero</i> thought to exclusive rights over their writing.  The point of writing a research article is to share knowledge as widely as possible.  You can often find PDF copies of published articles on the authors&#x27; websites <i>despite the fact that the authors signed over their copyrights</i>.  The only reason scientists ever bothered with publishing companies was that prior to the Internet distributing articles on a global scale required industrial equipment that publishers happened to have.<p>Frankly, do you really think that a system which requires expert lawyers to draft contracts, enforce royalty payments, and settle disputes by arguing before a judge is the sort of system that is meant to protect the interests of <i>individuals</i>?  Everything about copyright screams &quot;made for business.&quot;  That artists happen to be paid for their work under this system is merely a side effect; the real purpose is to confer an advantage to certain businesses, who (sometimes) happen pay artists/authors/programmers/etc. for their work.",1380078376

The boomers won&#x27;t be dead until the 2050s, and it will probably take just as long for someone who grew up worshiping Swartz and Snowden to occupy the White House. As Max Planck said, progress happens one funeral at a time. Guess what, modern medical technology has made funerals rarer than ever before.<p>One Swartz and one Snowden won&#x27;t change the world. I&#x27;m not even sure whether the kind of behavior they exemplify should be encouraged at all. But the thing is, those leaks weren&#x27;t one-man attempts to re-architect the USA. Rather, they are symptoms of a wider political and psychological change that has been going on for a couple of decades already, and will likely accelerate whether we like it or not. This is not about some violent revolution, it&#x27;s about social progress, and progress takes a long time.<p>Patches are coming. The pull requests won&#x27;t be as polite as they used to be.

And at the same thing you&#x27;re not hurting performance in cases where a slow function doesn&#x27;t significantly help security and performance might be important.<p>Making your hash function twice as slow means you&#x27;ve halved the number of hash operations you can perform with fixed computational power.  On the other hand, in many situations the resultant doubling of your security margin makes absolutely no practical difference since the existing margin is many, many order of magnitude away from any attacker&#x27;s capabilities.  Making things twice as hard on an attacker sounds impressive, until you think of it like asking someone to travel <i>2</i> billion light years instead of only 1 billion.  Both are ridiculously outside of our current capabilities, but anyone able to travel 1 billion light years is likely going to be able to travel 2 billion as well.<p>In more specific terms, making a function with 256 bit security 10x slower has a pretty dramatic impact on performance with a resulting security increase to about 259 bits of security.  You have a fairly marginal security increase for making your function 10 times slower.

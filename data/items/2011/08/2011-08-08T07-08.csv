The icon that looks like an iPod would intuitively go to music, but mousing over you see that it's for electronics. So the record must go to music, right? No, it's arts and entertainment. So now the visitor needs to hunt around via mouseover to find what they're after. Looking at the screenshot for their mobile app makes me wonder how they handle this effectively without mouseover. E.g., click on the pizza icon and see sushi gift cards? What, where's the pizza?",1312790326

Not necessarily to say that it's false, just to say that it's not a strong argument or at the very least holds little foresight.<p>As an example I recently downloaded Words With Friends on the Android, became immediately annoyed with the ads and was at a loss when I tried to find a pay version.  I emailed them and although they replied within hours (fantastic!) they said they don't have a paid version at the moment (it's in the works).<p>I'm reminded of John Carmack's ad-hock survey of iOS and Android users to find how many people would have spent at least $20 for apps[1], and then he explains in more detail why we won't be working with Android at that time.  His reasoning is solid, but that survey puts an exclamation on the same point you're making, which is unfortunate.<p>It's easy to claim nobody pays for things on Android if there's nothing there worth paying for.  It seems to me this would make Android a prime market rather than a poor one.<p>I've personally spent at least $40 on Android apps in the last year or so (mostly games) and will spend plenty more as developers come and give me reason (or at least a chance) to give them money.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_SdC8LVODY#t=8m40s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_SdC8LVODY#t=8m40s</a>",1312789800

Does ""Command V"" not make more sense than ""Control V""? And free up the Control key for more interesting stuff?<p>> I can't right click<p>You can, unless it's a 4+ years old machine it's just a preference (if you're using a trackpad). Any 2+ buttons mouse will natively ""right click"". Even on older machine, Ctrl+click will open a contextual menu.<p>> I can't win+d to the desktop<p>""Show Desktop"" is natively bound to Command-F3 on modern macs, on older ones it was on F11. It may also be bound to an active corner.<p>> So, go ahead, someone sell me on Macs.<p>Don't know if that will sell you. For me it was a combination of several things:<p>* Unix environment with an actually useable terminal. By default. Even in 10.3/10.4 (and Terminal has come a long way since then). cmd.exe never ""felt"" right, I never found a windows shell worth using (even Putty is a pain), and if you're going to remote log into a <i>nix machine anyway why not use one in the first place?<p></i> Spotlight works much, much better than Windows Search, and dedicated launcher applications (QS, Alfred, QSB, Butler, etc...) take that a step further<p>* 99% of the time, managing applications is Simply Easier. No fudging around with installer or painfully browsing to your Program Files folder (and wondering if the soft is 32 or 64b and in which program files you should put it and if you should create a shortcut so the bloody windows search can find it and...). Instead, open your archive (zip or dmg), drop the .app bundle in the Applications directory (via the dock or your finder sidebar) and launch it whenever. You can even launch it right there, nothing to do, no time wasted.<p>* A thriving indie community with loads of good software at fair price. I did buy licenses one Windows, but not many, and I did not find much which made me go ""damn I have to give these guys some dough back for their work"", even after I stopped being a poor student.<p>* Package managers. Whichever your pick is between Macports, Fink and Homebrew having one is invaluable.<p>* The machine is generally useable as is. Even if you don't download anything it can be used, you have a good PDF & image viewer (Preview is fairly amazing), lots of serviceable software, and it does not ""feel"" as clunky as windows long did.<p>Only negative I've found is that Finder is not as good as the Windows Explorer. Though with Windows 7, they've become significantly closer in that search has become shit in 7's explorer.<p>Essentially, OSX is a full unix with a bearable interface, softed by people who care.<p>Now if you don't do any dev on your box, it might lose some of its appeal.",1312789543

12:08 AM PDT We know many of you are anxiously waiting for your instances and volumes to become available and we want to give you more detail on why the recovery of the remaining instances and volumes is taking so long. Due to the scale of the power disruption, a large number of EBS servers lost power and require manual operations before volumes can be restored. Restoring these volumes requires that we make an extra copy of all data, which has consumed most spare capacity and slowed our recovery process. We've been able to restore EC2 instances without attached EBS volumes, as well as some EC2 instances with attached EBS volumes. We are in the process of installing additional capacity in order to support this process both by adding available capacity currently onsite and by moving capacity from other availability zones to the affected zone. While many volumes will be restored over the next several hours, we anticipate that it will take 24-48 hours until the process is completed. In some cases EC2 instances or EBS servers lost power before writes to their volumes were completely consistent. Because of this, in some cases we will provide customers with a recovery snapshot instead of restoring their volume so they can validate the health of their volumes before returning them to service. We will contact those customers with information about their recovery snapshot.",1312788606

It was more to point out the impact Stanford has on Silicon Valley (Apologies if it came off that way though).<p>2. Stanford/Haas/top programs do have some great events that anyone can attend (the entrepreneurship week at Stanford is top notch). I find these are great because you get to meet people who are in a unique point in their lives. I live in NYC now and the Columbia/NYU events have been great; I have never felt left out even though I do not attend either schools.<p>3. Stanford has some great lectures online; Yale/Berkeley does to. Search on Youtube and they are not too hard to find.",1312788046

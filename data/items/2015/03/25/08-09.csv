9261787,comment,9253690,9260897,0,0,beagle3,,,"> You seem to disagree that tailcalls should be optimized everywhere possible<p>I don&#x27;t disagree, assuming there&#x27;s a way to turn that off for debugging. I love it when things run faster and take less memory.<p>I disagree that &quot;there&#x27;s already a syntax for tail call&quot; (that can be relied upon if Python did TCE) because in Python there isn&#x27;t. Therefore, even if Python had TCE, it would be brittle (a small change 50 lines away could make it into a non-tail call) and it would be bad style to rely on it as a programming mechanism.<p>I&#x27;ve used common lisp with tailcalls. They work way better there than they would in Python, although there are still interaction problems with conditions/restarts/continuations/macros, mostly as invisible as they would be in Python. (Though, it&#x27;s been something like 20 years, my memory is hazy).<p>My claim can be summarized as follows:<p>1. TCO is nice and awesome. But it is an OPTIMIZATION, and shouldn&#x27;t be a central language feature you rely on, unless it is easy to guarantee it happens.<p>2. If you want to rely on TCE as a general programming technique, you should be able to say &quot;and if this thing isn&#x27;t a tail call, don&#x27;t compile&quot; or &quot;and if this thing isn&#x27;t a tail call, give me a warning&quot;.<p>3. A &quot;return from&quot; in Python could be an excellent way to implement (2) for Python<p>4. I think a special form for Scheme that says &quot;I rely on the following tail call being eliminated&quot; would have been useful, as it is easy to shoot yourself in the foot relying on it while e.g. using macros - where something that looks like it is a simple call expands to a non-trivial expression. Luckily, in CL (and I assume in Scheme as well), you could do that at the library level with a relatively simple code walker.<p>The Python Library-Level implementations that I&#x27;ve seen use a decorator to add the trampoline and need you to replace &quot;return f(a,b,c)&quot; with &quot;raise TailCall(f, a, b, c)&quot; (or something to that effect - you can get a much nicer syntax with some limitations). Ugly, inefficient, but available if you really need it.",1427272435

If there is a common factor in housing bubbles, it&#x27;s the extent to which housing moves away from its primary purpose (ie. a roof over a family&#x27;s heads). In China housing has become a massive source of income for local governments, income for developers, and an investment vehicle for rich people. It has all the signs of being a classic bubble and the only question is how/if the government can deflate it. Also don&#x27;t forget that a lot of people pay cash because they can&#x27;t get a mortgage or don&#x27;t trust the banks, but they still borrow money from friends, family, lending circles or other informal sources - there is often still a wobbly chain of debt behind each purchase.",1427272328

9261780,comment,9256264,9258370,0,0,hrktb,,,"Interesting discussion indeed. Personally I think past some point of automatisation and concentration of production means, these means will need to be made a public resource in some way.<p>Ideally the owners of the factories/robot armies will have an upside to that deal, but I think once a huge proportion of the population cannot produce and the basic goods are completely delivered by a few private parties,the social balance would collapse and could lead to a revolution.<p>About employment, I think the notion of work would change, and we&#x27;get back to a concept of occupying people. Of course entertainment would be of super high value, but one could imagine that fields with very low return on time invested like research, social care, artisanal craft or art/monuments building would also raise in popularity, with some additional sense of urgency so people emotionaly engage with their &#x27;work&#x27;.<p>In that system people still get value from their work, don&#x27;t need to feel assisted under a &#x27;basic income&#x27; banner.

Lot of these people hardly have anything significant on table and still get funded anyway. This is very similar to mortgage crisis where large number of people who don&#x27;t qualify can easily get mortgages anyway. Accelerators have mushroomed all over places doing dozens of meetups and networking events powered by &quot;luminaries&quot; that no one knows because they are literally now running out of even Class-C startup celebrities.<p>I believe it is well know that economic condition have been very unique last few years in that there is lot of investor money in market trying to find its home. Even if returns on VC is subpar many investors wants to give it a try because returns elsewhere sucked anyway and also there is a chance of winning the lottery. As the stock market and real estate continues to gain momentum and confidence, money would start start migrating back.<p>My prediction is that in next 5 years, investors are going to realize that it was a good try, VC returns sucks compared to S&P/real estate and they start pulling out. This will first cause shutdown of recently mushroomed accelerators/startup schools. That would then further spook VCs causing chain reaction eventually leading to meltdown. I think more prudent VCs such as Y and Sequoia would continue as usual but many other will simply shutdown because of lack of funds. This is not to contradict Sam&#x27;s predictions. Lot of the companies in his list can go big and easily double the value but in 5 years that would have much less effect on how much investment money VCs aquire.",1427271799

No matter how different our beliefs are, we all can love, hate, laugh, be jealous, greedy, selfless. We all share the feelings of pain and joy, hunger and lust. We all think in similar ways, because we run on the same cognitive architecture. Whatever the first AI will be, it will be unlikely to share any of that with us - especially if it will be some random process you happened to pull from the space of possible minds.<p>> <i>A wildly alien AI might actually have fewer reasons to fight with humans. It might simply carve out some economic niche to earn income to purchase what it needs, and go exist in some physical and/or virtual enclave somewhere. Last I checked Antarctica was big, uninhabited, and reduces the need for active cooling. Then there is space. Why wouldn&#x27;t an AI with no interest in living with humans just go to the Moon? There are points on the Lunar surface in perpetual daylight, meaning tons of free energy.</i><p>Did <i>we</i> do it? Did Europeans &quot;carve out some economic niche&quot; and engaged in trade with America? No, they just invaded it. Did we all move to Antarctica so that cows have space to live? No, we <i>eat them</i>. Because they&#x27;re <i>tasty</i>. Did we go to the Moon, because Earth has so beautiful ecosystem, full of various life forms, many of them quite smart? Of course not. We dominated it all.<p>There is no reason for AI to &quot;leave us alone&quot; unless we put care about human values in it explicitly. Because otherwise, why should it care?<p>A lot of confusion stems from people thinking about AI in anthropomorphic terms. If you want a good example what an actually alien mind can look, see the pretty much proto-AIs we managed to create, namely corporations, big bureaucracies and market economy. Even though they&#x27;re &quot;made out of people&quot;, they&#x27;re not optimizing for anything close to what any human would want. Hence various problems we discuss every day on HN.<p>I very much like the definition of intelligence as a very strong optimization process - it highlights the fact that a process doesn&#x27;t have to be like human to be dangerous.",1427270950

With the hash mechanism, 500 sites could share the same library, but only the site the user is visiting can ever know the user visited that site. Sure, one of those 500 gets the hit to performance on initial cache load, but averaged over all visitors to all sites, that's probably a comfortable trade.<p>I think it would take Mozilla or Apple to push this.

There are certainly cases where that is justifiable -- attacking the Enigma machine, for example (speaking of Turing...).  If World War II were to happen today, there would almost certainly be attacks on computer systems, and we would want our military to attack the enemy military's systems.<p>There is also the matter of law enforcement.  It is better for law enforcement agencies to exploit vulnerabilities (with a warrant) than to require special back doors in software.  No reasonable person can take issue with the police exploiting a vulnerability to catch a mafia hit man, a criminal arms dealer, etc.  Some hacker needs to be willing to write the software that exploits those vulnerabilities.  I would say that writing software with back doors is a much more serious ethical problem than exploiting unintentional vulnerabilities.",1367423888

However, you still have the option to build from source if you prefer, or want to select different compile options from the defaults.<p>It also comes with 'pkgin' which is very similar to 'apt-get' and allows you to quickly search, install, upgrade and remove binary packages.<p>This is the same framework we use for SmartOS, so if you provision a SmartMachine from Joyent you get the same interface.  pkgsrc is cross-platform, so you can use it on Linux, OSX, Solaris, *BSD .. or even more exotic systems such as Cygwin or Haiku.<p>If you have any comments/complaints I'd love to hear them, we want to provide excellent packages.",1367423822

5638705,comment,5636954,5637878,2,0,vec,,,"SQL databases are strongly typed and extremely good at enforcing consistency, whether you want them to or not.  They are quite good at preventing many classes of bad data from being recorded in the first place, and allow you to do some types of low level data manipulation (joining datasets, eliminating duplicates, finding mins and maxes, etc) extremely efficiently.<p>NoSQL, on the other hand, is weakly typed and makes few if any attempts to validate your data, pushing that responsibility back onto you.  They are very well suited to storing inherently inconsistent data (which, as a corollary, makes them very good for prototyping, when your data model is rapidly changing and growing).  They also allow you to link much larger datasets into a 'document' which is retrieved as a unit with no extra computation.<p>So it mostly boils down to what kind of data you want to store.  If you find yourself almost exclusively saying things like ""All users have a username that is a string"" or ""I want to be able to find all products that cost less than $20"" then you're probably looking for a traditional SQL database.  If, on the other hand, you find yourself saying ""some products have a width and height, but some just have a height, and a few have a volume instead"" or ""I want to be able to add custom fields to products on the fly"" or ""I never want to see purchases on their own, I always want to see them joined to the user that bought them"" then you should probably consider a NoSQL solution.",1367423665

Knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS required.<p>Back-end developers: you know what it takes to power the back-end of large web sites. You understand scalability issues and can explain the difference between an inner and outer join. You know what O(log N) is and why it's important. Your programming language history isn't important because you're good enough to learn a new language if needed.<p>All positions: not looking for rock stars. Looking for competent technical talent who are willing to move to Europe (unless you're already here).

In return, they offer a very agile environment, hard tasks, in a stable, long-term company. Large company, but each team gets a room with only a few people (no open-plan distractions). Management gets out of your way and meetings are discouraged. There's a heavy focus on constant performance optimization of systems because no one like a slow system. Multiple programming languages are used with the language being chosen to fit the problem and not the other way around.<p>Front-end devs: mostly PHP with Smarty and Propel, though other languages, such as Java,  and Python are used. You will be working on desktop, tablet and mobile applications and know Javascript and CSS fluently. This means more than just jQuery! Mobile experience is helpful, as it UX work.<p>System Engineers: you will be responsible for thousands of Linux servers across several data centers. Company 2 serves a quarter of a billion page views a day and heavy use of the latest open-source technologies is encouraged in their quest for better and better performance. Nginx, Puppet, stackless Python and MySQL are just a few of the technologies involved. The engineers are heavily involved in open source and are encouraged to give back to the community.

Usually this results in employment contracts for 6-12 months, followed by yearly renewals.  This is a bit one-sided: The employer can only sever the contract if there is a very good reason, but the employee can leave with 30 days notice.  After 3 years employees can be offered a 'permanent' contract... ""we won't fire you unless there is a huge problem and/or we will negotiate a severance"".<p>This 'loyalty' seems like a burden to employers from my American perspective.  After living here, I've noticed a few things about Dutch employee loyalty.<p>* Removing the fear of possible instant dismissal seems to orient employees toward long term improvement instead of maintaining status-quo.<p>* Defined intervals of contract negotiation do the same, they give both parties a goal.<p>* Employees want that 'permanent' contract, it gives them even more stability.  Once obtained, employees are hesitant to give up their luxurious position (true loyalty). My initial fear of a productivity drop doesn't seem to be valid, if I look at the 'perms' around me.<p>* Children do start to appear around this time, though.

To reduce downtime, companies depend on a global supply chain of warehouses, delivery services, and manufacturers to supply the service parts to maintain the infrastructure of the modern world. Baxter Planning Systems is seeking outstanding Java Developers to optimize and automate every facet of this service parts supply chain.<p>Baxter Planning Systems offers a unique environment combining the flexibility of a startup with the stability of an established company. Our developers are involved in the entire product lifecycle, from problem description to design and execution. 20 years of established business with numerous satisfied customers provides ongoing revenue that isolates us from the anxiety of funding cycles or the constant search for the next big deal.<p>Working closely with on-staff domain experts, our developers have the opportunity to learn about the complexities of global supply chain management, and offer their own solutions to the challenges it presents. Challenges like planning optimal stocking levels for tens of thousands of parts distributed across thousands of locations worldwide, combined with complex interdependencies due to substitutability, regulatory issues, and the need to minimize both downtime and cost.<p>The ideal candidate for Baxter is a smart developer who gets things done by applying technology, especially open source, to meet our goals while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. The development and QA teams work closely with key stakeholders to formulate and manage development timelines that are both realistic and produce high-quality application features. You won't have to start from scratch either: we have a great infrastructure of automated unit/integration/regression/UI tests, automated builds, virtualized test environments, and a solid technology stack. But we recognize there's always room for improvement and welcome the experience and expertise you'd bring in improving our development practices, tools, and execution.<p>Regretfully at this time we are unable to accommodate 3rd party placement agencies, H-1B sponsorships,  long-term telecommuting, or relocation.

That NAT solutions sold by various vendors are not designed to work with SCTP. And so on, and so on.""<p>NAT and firewalls (between nodes) break the Internet. They're ugly hacks that have outlived their usefulness. NAT is an ugly hack to fix IPv4's address space limitations, which IPv6 fixes elegantly. Firewalls were an ugly hack to fix the fact that most apps had poor-to-no authentication and poor-to-no encryption in ~1994 when the Internet went mainstream.<p>Firewalls are of dubious security value today, since the most common threats are:<p>* Malware delivered by web and email, which cross the firewall by default in most cases.<p>* Vulnerabilities in browsers and browser plugins, which are exposed to the web via connections almost always allowed through the firewall.<p>* Vulnerabilities in outward-facing web apps in the DMZ, which allow attackers to enter and then cross the firewall via a variety of techniques. (Or often the web app itself is the target, and it's dangling out there with little protection.)<p>* Phishing, spear phishing, targeted malware delivery via compromise of things like software updates and code repositories, and social engineering. It's generally easy to bait users into bringing a trojan horse in past the firewall.<p>Besides, protocols like SSH and HTTP are ""everything protocols"" that can encapsulate anything, so if you allow ports 22, 80, and 443 you are effectively allowing ""all.""<p>Inline firewalls (firewalls not residing on the node) are more trouble than they're worth. They provide little real-world security, and they do so at great cost to innovation and convenience. There are other solutions, such as centrally managed local firewalls or just securitying your f'ing services, that are lower cost and more effective.<p>In some cases I think firewalls make security worse by encouraging a ""soft underbelly"" behind them.<p>I satirized this whole situation here:<p><a href=""http://blog.zerotier.com/2013/04/zerotier-networks-enabling-ip-on.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.zerotier.com/2013/04/zerotier-networks-enabling-...</a><p>Most people didn't get the joke.<p>I really hope that IPv6 brings radical deperimeterization and de-NAT-ification, but I think it's going to take a more open challenge to the status quo to make that happen.",1367421796

You certainly have a point about beta-blockers, there was already a natural experiment being conducted on a mass scale in Europe. If it looked like it was safe and effective, there's no reason why that shouldn't have been used as evidence to expedite the approval process in the US. This isn't an indication that the entire process needs to be overhauled though.<p>As far as determining efficacy, I prefer this to the alternative. Simply judging rates pre-1962 doesn't really capture the potential for abuse that exists in our current media-saturated lives. Many European countries completely ban drug marketing towards individuals. If the FDA allowed drug makers to market unproven drugs in the US, that would create a huge clusterfuck of false advertising and manipulation. You cannot responsibly advocate both positions.<p>>By any rational standard, killing a hundred people by preventing them from getting their medicine is MUCH WORSE than killing one person by letting him get his medicine<p>Yes, using the severely biased statistics that are available. In an environment where proof of efficacy were not required, one can imagine that the drug making business (in the US where direct marketing is allowed) would be even stronger with greater pressure to push drugs on the general population. At scale, deaths rates due to drugs will show up that are impossible to discover using small scale testing. It is known that generic Aspirin kills a hundred or so people a year around the world.

Let's go with that for a moment: The nasty gotcha-part of this is that while it may or may not happen completely randomly with no particular concentration on minorities, the way out of the situation is not equally accessible.
 Since minorities tend to have less financial resources(for reasons we'll avoid talking about right now), they're much less likely to have a lawyer like psutor's parents had.
 If both me & him got a felony charge thrown at us, he'd get out of it. I don't think my parents could afford a lawyer at that time.
 This is kind of an important element. Even if whites & blacks get charged with the same frequency(and I don't believe that), the chances of the white(or asian) family having the money to get a lawyer to fight are much higher.
 Kinda like how kids of rich families can kill people in a drunk driving incident and get away with little consequence.

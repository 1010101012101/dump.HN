Assume that there's a situation where your language has to change, whether because of acquisition or scaling or hosting or lack of developers or licensing or whatever.<p>How do you switch?  And, more importantly, can you do it in a granular manner?<p>From Spolsky:<p>""First, there are architectural problems. The code is not factored correctly. The networking code is popping up its own dialog boxes from the middle of nowhere; this should have been handled in the UI code. These problems can be solved, one at a time, by carefully moving code, refactoring, changing interfaces. They can be done by one programmer working carefully and checking in his changes all at once, so that nobody else is disrupted. Even fairly major architectural changes can be done without throwing away the code. On the Juno project we spent several months rearchitecting at one point: just moving things around, cleaning them up, creating base classes that made sense, and creating sharp interfaces between the modules. But we did it carefully, with our existing code base, and we didn't introduce new bugs or throw away working code.""<p>Think about your system as a series of pieces and keep the as (appropriately) decoupled as you can.  Then, when you find a technical/business/legal bottleneck that is tied to a language issue, you can swap out that piece and keep moving.<p>I love being able to confidently say:<p>""Well, our integration point is always through the db, so if the mixer needs to be faster or rewritten in C++ we can do that.  If retrieval needs to be pulled out onto another machine, we can do that.  If you need it rewritten in Python, here are the five big pieces, and each one can be moved over independently.""",1207841868

The internet is far from 'shit'. Here in America it is single handedly saving our political system because the only way anyone can get any sort of information is through the internet. That doesn't mean that ALL information on the internet is always right. Far from it, but to cast aside the entire internet, THE ENTIRE INTERNET, because there is a lot noise is just nonsense. Its so much more than just political too. All kinds of people with all kinds of interests can connect in ways never before. In the end its always how one USES the tool, not the tool itself. How about a bet, if you think the internet is 'shit' lets log every site you go to. If you go to anywhere close to visiting 10%of every website in the entire world, I'll give you a $10.

If you have a small app written in .NET, and an acquisition would suddenly increase your userbase by an order of magnitude or two, this could be a cause for worry to the acquirer.<p>Also, as more and more web-based platforms are going to cloud computing architectures, ability to slide into a LAMP environment would reduce cost and make integration much easier (MHO only).<p>I'm sure that much of this depends on the size of the company doing the acquisition.  Google or Amazon probably have more overall resources and ability to deal with oddball platforms than a much smaller company, ex: if LinkedIn were to buy another social networking site based on .NET.<p>Bottom line, everything matters.  Language, office location, user base, founders, team, etc.  However different things matter differently in each situation, so it's difficult to structure yourself for easy acquisition once you get much beyond the ""3 founders in the basement"" stage.

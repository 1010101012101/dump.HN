US folk do seem to worship and argue the meaning of the constitution like people do with religious texts.<p>If the parallel works, the main issue I see is that religious groups and US citizens do seem to waste time and become paralysed by arguing meaning and intent, while action gets neglected. Again, from an out side POV, it look like the US constitution makes the US its self politically seize up, while US international policy seems wild and uncontrolled. My out side assumption is that the US constitution says a lot about internal politics, but nothing controls or governs its foreign policy. And, in that respect, may I suggest the adoption of Star Trek's Prime Directive as a start?<p>Lastly, does any one see a time when the US gets divided over how the constitution is interpreted? Will we see fundamental constitutionalists? Will we see something like a Catholic / Anglican split? Or different groups following different interpretations like with Islam? It seems that the right in the US is fairly constitutionally fundamental, could the extremes of them, with all their guns, become insurgents or terrorists to try to enforce their notion of the constitution? It seems to me, that the constitution actually allows for that. I mean, they do seem to see the centre right, or what the US might call the democrat left, as an internal threat to the US and its constitution. OK, perhaps laughable now, but what if this nasty vicious election process continues to get worse and worse? What if people begin to believe the lies? At what point might that tip over in to a violence the authorities can and wont suppress? Could US troops really fire on US citizens fighting for the constitution?<p>Just a New Years Day thought......",1357043152

The tools that json_decode gives you is available in Go (it would be syntactically awkward, out of a necessity born of Go being statically typed). An example: <a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/OvshdY1oVQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/OvshdY1oVQ</a><p>However, I would write it as follows <a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/pODFi9Jrve"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/pODFi9Jrve</a>. This is merely a different way of doing the same thing.<p>Now, to the topic that we are talking about is the claim that the latter is nicer. I was not comparing PHP and Go when I said that it was nicer (although I have some experience with PHP). I was drawing from my experience with working with JSON in statically typed languages. In particular, working with JSON in C++, Objective-C and Go. In all of these languages, the JSON libraries I used were essentially dynamically typed. I claimed merely that having the JSON library use reflection to deserialize into typed structures is nicer than using NSDictionary's various methods or maps in C++.<p>In PHP, the syntactic overhead of walking dynamic structures is obviously much lower than the languages I was thinking about, so that criticism is blunted when referring to that language. But I still believe there is some advantage there. A large part of what I find nicer about the latter is indeed the same reason I prefer static typing to dynamic typing. It is impossible to mistype the latter (try changing the "".Foo"" to "".Fo"" and trying to run the snippet). Consider that doing the equivalent in PHP will simply return NULL (I think), as it is really just doing a dictionary lookup. I fully admit that this is a static versus dynamic thing, not about JSON in particular.<p>As to the performance thing, I think you too easily discount the importance of low latency. But regardless, I was really comparing to Go's statically typed brethren. They essentially use hashtables for representing parsed JSON objects which is far less than ideal. Note that they don't employ the clever tricks that dynamic languages use. V8, for example, makes JS's objects (which are essentially hashtables) perform significantly better than a mere hashtable.",1357042655
4992477,comment,4991810,4992124,2,0,smsm42,,,"I think Founding Fathers acted like adults when they established the government. They actually wrote quite a lot explaining why they did it, and a lot of it makes sense if you read it. Government is a service, and it makes sense to make it specialized just as any other service - because specialization makes it efficient, that's why you don't make your own car, you buy it. Government, however, is a very dangerous thing, so there are some ways to manage it so it does not kill the people or make their lives miserable (think about a nuclear reactor - very useful thing if you do it right, very very dangerous thing if you let it go wrong). Unfortunately, American citizens seem to be letting their government to grow way beyond the planned sizes and do what it was never meant to do and never is going to do well. They are getting their ample share of misery for that, unfortunately.<p>As for the Plato's saying, there's also another one - ""Amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas"".

Abstracting services like ISI started up to help handle that data flow. I've decided that it's not worth stressing out over it.<p>There are two primary journals for my field, cheminformatics. These are the ""Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling"" and ""The Journal of Cheminformatics."" There are several other journals which will publish on cheminformatics, such as ""Algorithms for Molecular Biology.""<p>I have subscribed to the monthly email announcement and/or RSS feeds for those journals.<p>I also learn about what's important by watching the blogs of others in my field.

I talk to people, and see what they are interested in (""Activity cliffs"" being another recent hotness).<p>I'm very demand driven by what I read in depth.

I'll mostly go into a paper when I need to do something related to that topic, which is also how I handle papers outside the field.<p>The field of course draws from many other fields. For those I use the approach that I do for buying computers: mostly ignore things but every once in a while read a paper and make sure I understand the key concepts. When I need to get into that field, dig up the literature and work on a task.<p>For example, one of the things I'm interested in involves postings lists.

4992472,comment,4989579,4989579,5,0,CrLf,,,"One thing I've learnt early on my career as a sysadmin is that disk quality is <i>very</i> important, and so is the quality of the RAID controller or software RAID subsystem. After you have a multiple drive failure on a supposedly safe RAID-1, and get forced into stitching it back into operation with a combination of ""badblocks"" and ""dd"", you'll quickly understand why...<p>A good RAID controller won't let a drive with bad sectors continue to operate silently in an array. Once an unreadable sector is detected, the drive is failed immediately, period.<p>The problem is in the detection, but good RAID controllers ""scrub"" the whole array periodically. If they don't, or if you are paranoid like me, the same can be accomplished by having ""smartd"" initiate a long ""SMART"" self-test on the drives every week.<p>Good controllers will even fail drives when a transient error happens, one which triggers a bad block reallocation by the drive, for example. This is what makes some people fix failed drives by taking them out and putting them back in. After a rebuild the drive will operate normally without any errors, but you are putting yourself at a serious risk of it failing during a rebuild if another drive happens to fail, so DON'T do this.<p>Some others will react differently to these transient errors. EMC arrays, for instance, will copy a suspicious drive to the hot-spare and call home for a replacement. This is much faster than a full rebuild, but also much safer because it doesn't increase the risk of a second drive failing while doing it.<p>Oh, and did I mention that cheap drives lie?<p>Avoid using desktop drives on production servers for important data, even in a RAID configuration, if you don't have some kind of replicated storage layer above your RAID layer (meaning you can afford recovering one node from backup for speed and resync with the master to make it current).",1357042276

You have to follow a whole person, and take in their whole set of interests, and reply to them specifically if their remarks interest you. So for obscure hobbies, starting the conversation becomes much more difficult than on a dedicated site - plus take into account the relative size of the whole Web vs. Twitter.<p>In exchange for this weakness, Twitter gains vast influence in topics that have some critical mass of interest. Creative fields are an obvious pick - art, music, writing, programming, journalism, video games, among many others - all share a special space on Twitter. The professionals in the field have an easy time networking on Twitter since it's very informal and has ""degrees"" of friendship built in (comment, follow, follow-back). Plus if they're independent(which is the case for a lot of these creative fields) they have no corporate masters to hold back their thoughts; so subsequently, industry news and rumors flow through very readily - retweeting and hashtagging act to spread a single discussion across many otherwise removed individuals. This is where things get interesting, because it makes radically different perspectives collide with alarming frequency - it can't happen like that on a single forum because the ""minority"" or ""unprivileged"" perspective gets suppressed at some point.<p>Lifestyle and subculture topics are similarly hot on Twitter because they involve the whole person and how they choose to define themselves...often people on Twitter will converge into groups of friendship by transitioning from the ""interest topic"" to the people involved.",1357042108

If you (cross-)compile with CGO_ENABLED=0, then net/* will fall back to a pure Go DNS resolver, for which the only requirement is a valid /etc/resolv.conf on the target system.",1357042013

There's a trend across almost all forms of media towards easier, faster, wider and less expensive production and distribution. This is a Good Thing, but it introduces some interesting problems.<p>One of the main roles of traditional publishing is content curation. This seemed less important in the past when it simply seemed a byproduct of media products (books, tv shows, films etc.) being expensive to produce and distribute. But now, it's becoming clearer that curation is going to become a difficult problem to solve when it's trivial for people to publish their own product on the same platform as internationally successful content authors.<p>Sturgeon's law applies. In fact, it applies more now than ever because the minimum bar of quality has been lowered. How are we going to navigate something like the Kindle store as vastly increasing proportions of it become saturated with garbage?<p>I know curation is kind of a buzzword in startup circles at the moment, but it's vastly, vastly important. As a trivial aside, in another tab I'm reading a thread where people recommend the best little-known free software they use. Most of the top replies recommend a single software, most of which I then took a look at. One of them is a list of perhaps 20 softwares; my eyes glazed over and I moved on to the next reply.",1357042002

It does not mean it was perfect - many rights were still massively infringed and usurped, Constitution is ultimately nothing but an idea and people should still stand behind it for it to be effective - but it fared better than without it.",1357041800

Another developer (or you a month from now) doesn't have to go back and re-read, say, Redit API docs. He (or you) can just re-read definition of the struct and know all the data that a given JSON request provides. That's nice.<p>An editor can parse the struct definition and give you auto-complete, which is also nice.",1357041628

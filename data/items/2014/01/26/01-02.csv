It takes extra time for us to understand how something was built, and why. The developer should help us along with this.<p>Think about even the simplest API if it isn&#x27;t documented, how long will it take you to figure out what you can do with it and how.<p>For me, it is also likely that the original developer is a much better programmer than I am. Or at least, I assume they are. I suspect there will be much of their source that I don&#x27;t understand. Of course, reading their code makes me a better developer, but I&#x27;ll often need help, and good documentation will help along with that.<p>It sounds horrible to say &quot;I expect that if you&#x27;re going to create an open-source bit of code that will help me code better/easier/faster, I also expect you to document it well and give examples&quot;, but if somebody is going through the trouble of developing something they want other people to use, I think this is an important part of that process.<p>What do people think of documenting first, and building from that documentation? I&#x27;m putting together my first open-source project, and am thinking that may be a good way to manage the documentation thing. Anybody done that before?",1390701562

The second item specifically highlights documentation cost overhead of traditional methods as a major grievance: &quot;Working software <i>over comprehensive documentation</i>&quot; (see also [1]). I don&#x27;t think money is a differentiating factor, we&#x27;re talking about the software <i>business</i> in the end after all.

My view is that the people that began popularizing the agile term were in fact &quot;grown up&quot; programmers. Are we talking about different things when we talk about design? What is the output of &quot;design up front&quot; in the traditional sense if not documentation and diagrams?

The vibe of his statement made it feel to me that he was working for a software company which is why I responded in that context.\n..\nAssuming the case you present: \nIf the OP is even a goodish engineer there are lots of opportunities out their and companies that have internal IT have to be conscientious of the fact that they are hiring from a pool of people in a high demand sector. Standard methods for managing other departments may not hold up in the IT department at a company that has decided decided to internalize dev. The decision to force this square peg through the round hole of the rest of your company culture may lead to the failure of the goal of internal dev at your company. \n..\nFor a number of years I worked for a large org that had decided to internalize some dev. The engineering division functioned very differently than the rest of the company. Meetings were more flexible there was no way to predict when developers might actually be on site or working from home (something that was rigidly controlled in the rest of the organization). Friends in other sections would ooze with jealousy over our lifestyle... usually right up to the point where I started talking about the average number of hours engineers in our department billed to the organization. I was part of a team that regularly worked 15 to 18 hour days and was happy doing it. The fact of the matter was growing the development team was difficult, candidates with the appropriate skills were scarce. When I was hired the company had spent 2 years looking for someone to fill the position and it was another year of serious looking before we were able to hire another. Keeping in mind the company spent serious time and resources trying to grow this team which it wanted to be bigger. The company recognized the support provided by our scarce resource by affording developers with the leeway to live in a way were they might produce their best work.\n...\nthe is a great story about Jeff Bezos telling an employee how to deal with a bad manager by voting with their feet:\n<a href=""http://lifehacker.com/5921729/jeff-bezos-taught-me-when-to-quit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifehacker.com/5921729/jeff-bezos-taught-me-when-to-q...</a>\nThe fact of the matter is there are a management success is dependent on cultural buy-in and a manager who was very successful at one company may fail at another because of a predetermining culture that they don&#x27;t fit into. This is a risk companies in general have to manage and not figuring it out can cost money over time and potentially lead to failure.\n..\nAlso I know this is Y combinator but I think that it is weird the way that people use the word startup to mean software company and talk about it like its an industry instead of a phase. sorry if this is lexically nit picky of me but i feel like the fact that you called me out for assuming that the poster works at a software company and not in the IT shop of a larger org puts you in a sort of glass houses and stones situation when it comes to word choices.",1390698172

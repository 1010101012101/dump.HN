8578415,comment,8577821,8578094,0,0,hnmcs,,,"Using this automobile production analogy, I would say that a full-stack tech engineer is analogous to an autoengineer who understands all levels of the production, with some direct experience in the types of relevant manufacture processes of all components of the automobile, as opposed to only understanding based on the blackboard theoretical description of auto production. They know the design principles of engines and of electric systems, and materials science, and the relevant history of the industry leading up to the state of the art. They could join the division-of-labor sub-team for any arbitrary process of production, because they understand any arbitrary process at the blackboard level and have some general experience in the types of any arbitrary manufacture process -- though they are never actually permanently required to stick to just one sub-unit of operation. And thank $deity someone does understand the whole picture, otherwise no one would, and you&#x27;re just waiting for some new problem to bring down the whole cargo cult operation.<p>This is in contrast to someone doing one aspect of the division of labor, who knows his division, but doesn&#x27;t understand the full stack of automobile development. <i>&quot;I just make sheet metal into body parts. Engines and electrical systems are magic to me.&quot;</i><p>Not all code production houses need full-stack expertise, because they actually can operate in their niche without it thanks to our system of finance and contracts. Most don&#x27;t, in fact. But big operations (<i>a la</i> a major automobile company) had just better be sure they have engineers who understand automobile production from design to showroom (reverting to the analogy).",1415487522

With the exact address, not something vague like state or city.<p>> and that was everyone&#x27;s responsibility to report any suspicious activities<p>Have you heard about neighborhood watch? They even have menacing signs all over the area that they patrol, reporting any suspicious activity, calling the cops on you if you linger and look around.<p>Lately the public appeals to rat suspicious strangers intensified. About 3 years ago, in Boston&#x27;s subway I was hearing a PSA with a friendly fireman telling us to be vigilant and report any suspicious individual to the local authorities. I did not have the courage to pull out my camera and take photos of the station. I was suspicious enough already.<p>> Promotion at work? well, you&#x27;d need a recommendation from the head of the block where you lived.<p>It was worse than that. You needed to be a member of the one true Party in order to get ahead. But it wasn&#x27;t much different in the States at one point: you had to be proven innocent from accusations of un-american activities if you wanted to keep your job. Even today, people have to register as democrats, republicans or independents before voting. Can you guess how many of them get to keep their political affiliation a secret?<p>> No one cared about police listening to phone conversation or checking (snail) mail.<p>Of course they did. Those brave enough to seek information from external propaganda sources like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe were taking a serious risk. So were those who told jokes that mocked the regime. Or those trading in banned books. Or those practicing religion in an atheist state. Or those secretly passing manuscripts to foreign visitors so they can be published abroad. Or those dealing with abortions in a state that forbid them categorically because it needed as many new citizens as it could get.

But I take issue with the absolutist position that reason is always the best tool for the job. When I subscribed to that way of thinking, I was more interested in winning the argument than being compassionate. I saw the world in black-and-white terms, and I was proud of it.<p>The problem, of course, is absolutism in any form. In answer to your other question, what triggered the change for me was an interest in Buddhism/Taoism and taking a psychoactive substance (LSD) for the first time. I realized that reason is a tool, not a worldview, and it isn&#x27;t always the right tool for the job. Specifically, it&#x27;s often the wrong tool for interacting with other people, because it leads to this mindset where you&#x27;re always judging everyone. If someone says something you don&#x27;t agree with, they&#x27;re no longer an equal.

He said that he remembered being outside when bombings were starting, and seeing large dust clouds in the distance, making their way toward the city.<p>One night the city caught fire (it was firebombed in addition to the normal bombings) and he and his wife, both in their 20s, ran outside into the street and covered themselves with their futon mattresses as means of protective cover. The next morning they arose to find their neighborhood severely burned, and the outsides of their mattresses even partially charred.<p>Later I talked to another man who grew up near Nagoya--he used to love watching the bombings so much that he and his friends would sneak out of their bomb shelters and lay in the rice paddies watching them fly over.

Spending a few nights at your relatives? Had to register with the local police department.<p>Talking about local police, there was usually an officer responsible for a given residential area. He/she knew every member of every families living there. People, usually one per family, were &quot;encouraged&quot; to attend monthly meeting where they were reminded that there were &quot;evil&quot; forces who did everything to undermine the party and the government, and that was everyone&#x27;s responsibility to report any suspicious activities (I did hear that a lot post 9/11 in the US, but only at public places, for unattended packages. Still it provokes a lot of memory).<p>Promotion at work? well, you&#x27;d need a recommendation from the head of the block where you lived. Make sure to be on good terms with him.<p>Wanted to visit another country? You couldn&#x27;t, unless on official business. As the result no one could have a passport until their first trip abroad.<p>The sad thing is, most people considered all of that as normal, if annoying, facts of life. No one cared about police listening to phone conversation or checking (snail) mail. Because that was their job, of course. In fact, where I lived such policies were overwhelmingly supported. When the Berlin wall was demolished, I remember asking my dad why Soviet Red Army let such thing happen. Why not invade and crush &quot;the enemies&quot;.

Birth control?  Where&#x27;s the line between dental and health insurance?  (I know my dental is a little weaker.)  These haven&#x27;t come up so I haven&#x27;t bothered to learn about them.  Maybe I should.<p>I expect that if I have to go to the ER, I&#x27;ll be covered; its some of the the edge cases I don&#x27;t know about.  There are probably laws that ensure some of these, but I just don&#x27;t know much about it.  I&#x27;m a largely healthy person and have been my whole life.",1415484444

8578291,comment,8578028,8578028,0,0,whoopdedo,,,"A snag in the &quot;be let alone&quot; doctrine is citizens of a country have a duty to interact with the government that doesn&#x27;t allow a person to just be let alone when he wants. When necessity demands that a person divulge personal information, does all privacy then disappear? I think it should not. Privacy can&#x27;t be viewed as a binary option. It also has to be seen not only as a limit on what can or cannot be seen, but an obligation on the part of the receiver of information not to abuse the privilege they have been granted.<p>But traditional law hasn&#x27;t led to this conclusion. It sees privacy as an effect of location. Can a thing be seen, heard, or touched directly at the time and place that it exists? I think this is an outdated concept that is difficult to apply to an age of widespread communication and long-term information storage. I think privacy should be seen as an inherent property of a thing that doesn&#x27;t change as it changes hands. My personal information is still my personal information no matter who knows it. The difference between what is private and what is public is the expectation I have when I share it with someone else.<p>So if I volunteer information unasked, there should be little expectation of privacy for what I say. However if I am compelled to give my name and address in order to receive a service, the default assumption should be that I want that service alone and no one not required to know it for that purpose should be privy to the knowledge.<p>It becomes more critical when dealing with legal obligations. The right against self-incrimination applies so if I am required to give personal information by some law, it should not then be used as evidence in a criminal investigation. But that&#x27;s what happens in the current environment where information you&#x27;re required to give the government gets entered in the public record with no expectation of privacy and is subject to be queried by law enforcement at any time. It forces a situation where in order to fully exercise your right to remain silent against self-incrimination, you have to live as a hermit avoiding all contact with the government.<p>Actually, I think there is a bit of common law that applies: the idea of trespass. An unlocked door is not an invitation to entry. Why should an unencrypted message be treated as an invitation to read? Yes, I realize that would reverse the geek-friendly precedent that anything broadcast on radio waves is free to listen to. But that&#x27;s the libertarian&#x27;s dilemma: an enforcement of one person&#x27;s freedom may infringe upon another person&#x27;s freedom.<p>I think the benefits of increased security for communications can outweigh the restrictions on radio scanners. We&#x27;re already partly limited anyway because of copyright and electronic eavesdropping laws. Though I&#x27;d feel less trepidatious if our government didn&#x27;t have a habit of outlawing tools that could be used to commit a crime as an alternative to actually enforcing the crime.",1415484369

8578281,comment,8577828,8577828,0,0,phillc73,,,"I first went to Berlin in December 2000. I was not even one week off the plane from Australia, and it was cold. Very cold. The wind ripped through my inadequate jacket and chilled me to the core. I remember very clearly venturing into the East. Along Unter den Linden, through Mitte and into Alexanderplatz. Even then, ten years after re-unification, it was grey but it was interesting. There were still buildings that didn&#x27;t appear to have been touched for 50 years. Crumbling, battle scarred buildings that were evocative of everything I&#x27;d been taught as a school child.<p>Over the next five or six years, I must have traveled to Berlin around a dozen times. On each occasion I stayed in the same Mitte hotel, ate breakfast at the same cafe and tried to absorb an atmosphere that was completely different to my very rural upbringing in Australia.<p>My last visit to Berlin was in 2012, on business. Mitte was nothing like I remembered it. I couldn&#x27;t find the old hotel, or the cafe, or the bars. The Spree was still there, and the Pergamon museum. Yet, something had certainly changed and I lost feeling for the city. Maybe it was a case of being older, perhaps just being there with different people, under different circumstances.<p>In 1989 and the early 1990s, I wasted a lot of time. Stoned or drunk, or just being an idiot. The majority of my late teens and early twenties were spent not particularly productively.<p>I spent a year in South Africa in 1992, before the first free elections in 1994. I treasure the time and friends I made. Yet, I spent my time in very rarefied circumstances, protected and cossetted from a lot of reality. If I look back on that time, I&#x27;m grateful for it, as my young immature self would have probably otherwise ended up dead in a gutter somewhere.<p>The people in this article probably wasted just as much time, stoned and drunk (maybe). Yet, looking back they were part of something. Part of a moment that turned modern Europe, and perhaps Western society, in a different direction. There was no real comment in the article about how they felt about that. At the time, they may not have been so consciously aware of their involvement in a fulcrum, but surely in retrospect they can look at their 1990s youth and appreciate how fortunate they were to be involved in that page of history.<p>During the last fourteen years, I&#x27;ve spent quite a lot of time in Eastern Europe, mostly Latvia and Ukraine. There is a smell. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, it&#x27;s just the smell of clocks running a little slower than in London, or New York, or Los Angeles, or indeed now in Berlin.",1415484081

The fear of eating tainted food seems to be a sort of primal fear or archetype and I think the GMO issue taps directly into this. True, the concerns around GMO mostly involve things like remote ecological ramifications, not literal poisoning; but the fact that GMO is in the food supply (or could be) seems to raise the emotional temperature 100x. At any given time, there are people suffering because they can&#x27;t afford to eat any food -- that concerns me more than the risks from GMO.<p>GMO might lie in a kind of nexus of overlapping fears; there are definitely others in there, too.",1415484080

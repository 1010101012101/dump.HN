Due to architecture that is easier on a CPU than on a GPU, so you can't directly compare teraflops and conclude that GPUs are superior. Getting something to run fast on a GPU is very difficult.<p>And actually the thing that does 4.5 teraflops in <i>single precision</i> does only 95 gigaflops in double precision per GPU. A good x86 CPU does ~100 gigaflops in double precision as well, and you're much more likely to actually achieve that number on a x86.

It wasn't called DRM at the time, but DRM is just an acronym describing any similar practice, not a specific technology.<p>I see a huge difference between software copy restriction (a.k.a ""protection"") and DRM. With copy restriction, you owned your copy and could do anything you wanted with it, including lending and reselling it. Many of these schemes would still let you make a backup, so long as the dongle/original was available for a 1 second check. That is, the restriction was on distribution.<p>Modern DRM restricts use.<p>> From Wikipedia we also learn: ""A very early implementation of DRM was the Software Service System (SSS) devised by the Japanese engineer Ryoichi Mori in 1983 [135] and subsequently refined under the name superdistribution. The SSS was based on encryption, with specialized hardware that controlled decryption and also enabled payments to be sent to the copyright holder.""<p>That's more in line with modern DRM. But Japan had always been in the future :)",1340366065

I think my arguments regarding impact of the change are a reasonable extrapolation from that.<p>Why was it pragmatic? Why was it an issue? There was inconsistency in the ways that functions handled parsing, and many people didn't want that feeling it made it harder to code correctly/consistently, thus it was an issue (part of the greater issue of inconsistency across a number of aspects of PHP). For others it wasn't an issue, which is why a pragmatic solution is the best that could be hoped for, not everyone would agree/like the outcome whatever was done (or not done). I can't see any other way of taking the language forward whilst causing minimum impact to users, which is why I (not you) think it was the most pragmatic way.<p>Every piece of code we write is ""implementation-defined"", including the bugs. It wasn't coherent with most other function implementations. Users couldn't reliably treat functions in the same way. I agree it wasn't coherent with numerical operations, but to get that consistency you would have to change a whole load more functions, and you would get many more complaints like this one.<p>""For all intents and purposes"" - I think this discussion (and the many others that have featured on HN talking about similar issues of the weakly typed nature of PHP, such as == vs === ) show that it there are real world consequences to treating strings and numbers as compatible.",1340365962

It's not like you can lump a whole load of different countries into one basket and make sweeping generalisations.<p>""How can you even compare holocaust denial laws to what muslim countries do?"" - Very easily. The holocaust was over 65 years ago. The perpetrators of this egregious act are mostly dead. The victims of this egregious act are mostly dead. The modern German of today had nothing to do with the holocaust. Their mother and father had nothing to do with the holocaust. What does making holocaust denial do other than prohibit a form of dissent? Does it bring people back to life? No, it does not. Does it stop it from happening again? Just because a crime is unmentionable does not mean that it would not happen (and the holocaust is not the only genocide, nor the most efficient one, there have been many more before and since).<p>When you remove the right to say fuck, you remove the right to say fuck the government. In Germany any debate on the extent of the holocaust is stifled due to the law, the same (but opposite case) as it is in Turkey with respect to the atrocities referred to by some as the Armenian Genocide. In both cases the law is wrong and stifles free speech and people go to jail[1][2] for dissent against it.<p>> Religious headscarves should be banned for the same reason slavery is.<p>You really have no understanding of the purpose, origin or practice of the headscarf in countries around the middle-east and mediterranean whatsoever. Would it come as some surprise to you to know that in the early 20th century Irish women would wear headscarves to protect their modesty?

You think denying people the right to disagree with the state or condemning them to a life with their rapist or torturing a man AND taking away the right of people to deny a historical fact are the same thing?

Perhaps they are less so (or simply better at it?) but this simply won't stop any time soon.<p>Education is an issue but only in the long term. Assuming Pakistan managed to overcome several of its other problems, uneducated would become Pakistan's most important resource. Uneducated people are what make industrialisation possible. They make low wages possible and so the country becomes interesting as a manufacturing base (as Thailand has become for example).<p>With more economic activity will come education and then the country will have to find an alternative economic source.<p>More education will also affect corruption as educated people tend to be less willing to put up with it.<p>This is of course overly simple but for a big picture, it does hold some truth.<p>I believe that focusing prematurely on education, is actually counter-productive as the tissue of companies in need of educated workers simply is not there and makes low wages more difficult.<p>The West is also a good example of other issues with educated people. Countries full of educated people are more difficult to manage. For example France is badly in need of deep reforms but they will simply never happen because French would go on strike as a result of such reforms.<p>For what it's worth, in France you'd get a 90 Euros fine for speeding on a standard road.

Thinking about scalability and price, I'm thinking am I better off on a VPN to get started or would some form of cloud hosting be better (not being familiar with either).<p>Full question:
I'm creating a product where people can create their own 3D representations of whatever data / info they have, and (re)organise that data. The product is coming along beautifully on my local environment, but it's about time I start getting some form of hosting ready, and I could really use some advice where / how to get started:<p>- I'd like people to be able to move/register their own domains on my server. 
I could start without this just to demo the product, but it would be the very first on the todo list.
I'd like to automatically copy some files / install databases etc for each domain. I probably want to see if I can let users manage their own subdomains at some points, but for now:<p>- I'd like start as simple as possible
I've always on a windows machine, so my linux experience is quite basic. I really don't mind getting into it, but I'm thinking it's better to get my product out first of all and see where to go from there. Although...<p>- I'd like things to be scalable. 
If I set up some reseller VPN now which only scales to 100 domains or so, which means I have to set up something else / move again when I pass that level, or which means that I'm in trouble if I suddenly get lots of new customers... hmm.<p>- Finally, I need to start cheap. 
I'm putting all I have into starting this company, and live on very little. So before I have any customers, 50 dollars a month is a fair bit and 100 dollars a month may be too much.<p>If anyone has some tips to help get me started I'd be really grateful.

Who knows, if we put 1 billion cores together, and fed it a massive amount of data (akin to what a baby receives as he/she matures), perhaps we would get a brain we would consider ""intelligent"".  The fact that this system was able to pick out high-level features like ""face"" and ""cat"" without any prior training -- and with only 1000 cores, not 1 billion -- is quite suggestive that they're on to something.<p>EDIT: Mistyped number of cores.  1000, not 100.",1340363543

Primarily, education of the people ... what good is a democracy if people cannot understand the democratic system - nor see past the public visage and look deeply into what kind of person a political candidate is.<p>This poor education leads Zardari (a corrupt politician who has ties to the murder of Murtaza Bhutto) only coming to power due to a three way effect of a sympathy vote (assassination of Benazir Bhutto), bribery and threats to people who work on his land (he is one of the largest land owners in Sindh). Nowhere else in the world would a criminal become the president of a nation.<p>The secondary problem is ALL the corruption from the upper levels of politics, to the police itself. If you're caught speeding in Pakistan, simply apologise to the officer who has caught you and slip him a few hundred rupees.<p>Want to get out of the airport faster by not having your bags security checked? Slip 500 rupees to the security officer.<p>Are you the prime minister of the country being investigated for money laundering? Make the lives hell for judges and lawyers.<p>Fix the education problem and everything else will fall into place and this is something that I truly hope that PTI will do, should they on the unlikely chance get into power (I say unlikely as I envisage that the PPP will somehow manage to bullshit their way through another election).",1340362918

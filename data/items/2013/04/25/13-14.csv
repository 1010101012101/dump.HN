It sounds like this is his pet project, with him starring, and him getting most of the profits, but he wants his fans to take all the risk? Seems off to me.</i><p>According to Braff, the $2 million hes asking on Kickstarter wont be enough to cover the entire production. On Twitter:<p><i>@zachbraff: 2 things for pple who are very upset about this Kickstarter campaign: I'm putting TONS of my own money into it.</i><p>And then theres this Buzzfeed article[1]:<p><i>How much of your own money are you investing?</i>\nI don't know. It will depend on how much we raise, and who I do end up casting. Let's say we raise our goal, which is $2 million. If we only raise that, that's not enough to make the movie. There will be some element of selling some foreign [distribution rights] to meet the difference, and where that falls is where I will be splitting the difference. I'm going to make this movie in August come hell or high water. Wherever we fall short, I or some element of foreign sales will split the difference.<p>[...] There's always going to be detractors. The people who would say, ""Fuck him, he should pay for it himself,"" I don't expect those people to be the supporters of this project. I get it. But if you scroll down [on the Kickstarter page], you'll see the person who's like, ""Garden State meant a lot to me, I'm dying to see what this guy's up to next, I'm in."" Those are the people I'm making the movie for. It's not a scam. If I wanted to make dough, I'd go back and be on another TV show.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/zach-braff-on-why-kickstarter-is-the-next-best-thing-to-actu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/zach-braff-on-why-kickstar...</a>",1366898387

5607157,comment,5606891,5607039,8,0,Steuard,,,"I'm not an expert (just a physics prof), but my understanding is that LEDs always emit one specific color (wavelength) of light rather than white light (which is a mixture of many wavelengths). So if you want to use an LED to produce white light, you set up a material that absorbs light at one wavelength and then re-emits it in a wide variety of wavelengths (that is, the phosphor).<p>(This is also the way that fluorescent bulbs work: the hot mercury vapor inside produces invisible ultraviolet light, but the phosphorescent coating absorbs that UV and re-emits it in a range of visible wavelengths. And it's no coincidence that they're using a blue LED with a short wavelength: in general, a phosphor can only re-emit at longer wavelengths than it absorbed. That may imply that these bulbs emit little or no violet in their ""white"" light, since violet has a shorter wavelength than blue.)",1366898229

(""Have I got an extra/missing brace in there somewhere?  Put the cursor on the brace and tap `%` until I work out what's out of place.""

5607111,comment,5606039,5606895,7,0,benbataille,,,"No, this nonequivalence applies directly to the typing of the lambda-calculus which was the topic of the original papers  by Hindley and proven by Damas.<p>On the contrary, the value restriction is a part of the extended rules used for the typing of ML. It was introduced because ML isn't pure, it supports references. The value restriction is there to prevent them having polymorphic type. The rule is simple : syntactic values are the only things receiving a polymorphic type. What is a syntactic value ? To quote Geoffrey Smith notes on SML97 ""Basically, a syntactic value is an expression that can be evaluated without doing any computation"".<p>All this iss done in order to ensure type safety. Actually, if references could have a polymorphic type, the type system would accept incorrect programs such as :<p>let r : 'a list ref = ref []\nlet r1 : int list ref = r\nlet r2 : string list ref = r\nr2 := ""a""\nlet v : int = 1 + !r1<p>Which does not work because r, r1 and r2 are references to the same value.<p>Value restriction is a bit overkill. It rejects program which could be safely typed. Other solution to this problem exists. Actually, Standard ML used a different solution at the beginning (carrying information about the typed hold in a cell along) but it has other drawbacks. MLTon has a really good page about all that : <a href=""http://mlton.org/ValueRestriction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mlton.org/ValueRestriction</a><p>Some research was done about relaxing value restriction. OCaml type system, for example, has less constraints than SML and MLTon (you can see this paper about that <a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/pub/papers/garrigue-value_restriction-fiwflp04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caml.inria.fr/pub/papers/garrigue-value_restriction-f...</a>).",1366897771

I find OSX has finally almost caught up to Linux with Mountain Lion.<p>It's crazy how many OSX features come from the unix world but in a delayed, better looking fashion.<p>The last missing major piece for OSX was good multiple workspace management, which came in the form of mission control and the touchpad gestures that makes it so efficient. I don't know if its any good with a mouse though.<p>Efficient multiple workspaces is a critical productivity feature for me. It's like having multiple monitors without having to carry a desk and a bunch of monitors with me all the time.<p>The previous OSX implementation called 'spaces' took too many actions to switch workspaces unless you had your hands on the keyboard and had setup shortcuts. This made OSX unusable to me.<p>Unfortunately, Ubuntu also regressed by getting rid of the single-click workspace switcher (which was working beautifully since like 1995) and doing a multi-workspace UI that resembles Lion's 'spaces'. However, I was able to remedy this by setting my middle mouse button to bring up the workspace switcher which is really fast.<p>The other Ubuntu regression which annoys me to no end and again is the same in OSX is that clicking on a dock icon when you are in a workspace and there is an instance of the app opened in another workspace makes you automatically jump to the other one instead of opening a new instance in the current workspace.<p>This assumes I separate applications on a per workspace basis which is stupid. I already have a dock to get access to different applications. Workspaces are used to separate projects or workflows.<p>Each workspace needs its own browser window that holds the tabs related to the project being worked on and also its own terminals and text editors. I don't want to be yanked out of a context because I tried opening an editor and there wasn't one already in the workspace.<p>Hopefully this is eventually fixed in both OSX and Ubuntu.",1366897483

That is the classification system itself. Essentially ""top secret"" is a viral license. Information synthesized from N sources gets a secrecy level of at least max_level(sources). Frequently even more.<p>Further, if someone with secret knowledge works on something that isn't at all in classified space, it may turn out that the new product/work needs to be classified, because classified knowledge may have gone into it.<p>This is a very virulent license - worse than the most paranoid analyses of GPL.<p>Countering this, the declassification process is slow, difficult, and a bit ridiculous. Lots of things remain classified not because they present a continuing issue, but because they make someone look bad. Or because they may be used to establish a pattern or MO that could endanger current operations. Even if that information is widely published.<p>As an aside - one of the fun games you can play with your friends that have some sort of clearance is to ask them recent news related to their area of work. If they respond with vague statements ""oh thats interesting"" or ""I don't know anything about that"" and keep trying to change the subject, it generally means they saw a classified briefing about it, or expect to, and can't reveal or discuss anything about it, even if it is all over the news. Particularly if they're very resistant to such discussion. It's a nice way to screw with them. (It's a game because they figure out what you're doing and start screwing with you back, be careful tho, you don't want to get them in serious trouble, or yourself in trouble for pushing too hard).<p>Anyway, the weird viral classified things is why I have rejected offers of work requiring a clearance. It is just too annoying to get interesting side projects and open source participation done when you're in the world of classified.

But keep in mind that they're paying with the money that the investors give them, and that this is the EXPLICIT deal.<p>When I lead a syndicate deal, I am the person that works with the investors' lawyer to get the deal done. But I'm never the majority of the round (or even the largest single investor.) But being the person who retained the lawyer for the investor group, I am on the hook for the bill.<p>I'm happy doing the work of getting the deal papered, but I wouldn't be happy if I had to pay the whole legal bill when I'm only putting in 10-20% of the round's money.<p>There are two ways to share the expense:<p>1) I pay the lawyer then go around to the other investors asking them to pay me their piece. Anyone who has ever been saddled with being the payor of the bill for a large group of people at a bar or restaurant knows how this turns out. Some people forget, some people argue that they should pay less, and it's a huge logistical hassle creating nothing but bad feelings. I suppose I could get each investor to sign something saying they would pay me their share, but that's just more legal expense.<p>2) We up-front tell the company that they are paying the investors' legal bill (last time I did this, the bill was $6k, the cap was $10k: I don't do fancy deals.) The company factors this into their calculation of whether the investment structure is one they want to accept or not.<p>Number 2 is nothing more than a structural convenience.

5606945,comment,5596578,5600300,2,0,prirun,,,"My solution to this has been to work a project in two phases.  This is for 6-9 month projects.  The first phase is billed hourly, to develop the project requirements and milestones.  In this phase, I'd break things down as much as possible into the number of days I thought tasks would take and develop a very detailed plan.  The client never saw this plan; it was for me to develop the schedule.  I'd also keep notes of any potential ""gotchas"" that came to mind.  Ideally, this detailed plan has things broken down into 1-3 day-sized bites.  If I think something will be easy, I use 1 day.  If I think probably 1 day, I'd put 2.  If I think I might run into trouble, I'd put 3 days.<p>Now go back and look at the gotcha list.  What can be done to eliminate these contingencies?  Maybe you need to do some investigating or experimenting right now, before doing the schedule, to eliminate the uncertainty (and get paid for this under the hourly contract).  If you can't eliminate the uncertainty, you have to keep it as part of the schedule, as an assumption: ""Assumes the X library will be available by <date>"".  This assumption list is crucial, because if someone else doesn't meet their deadline, it lets you off the hook and you can make a schedule adjustment.<p>When you present the project schedule, have milestones with deliverables at reasonable intervals, like 4-8 weeks, and take payment for each one.  This has lots of advantages:<p>- if the client scraps the project (often happens in big companies), you've been paid for your work.<p>- if you miss a deliverable, you will know early that there is a problem with your schedule.  It's better to tell a client early that there is a problem and make adjustments rather than try to make it up and act like everything's fine<p>- if you _really_ miss deliverables, the client has time to can your ass and get someone else to do the work<p>- when you know you have to actually turn something over to a client to prove that you have met a milestone, it's a powerful motivation to stick to the schedule and not get distracted too much.<p>So, hourly consulting part first, then fixed part.  If a client wouldn't agree to the hourly part to develop the schedule, I probably would pass on the project.",1366895578

If your goal is to ""beat"" others (revealing choice of words) and either make more money or gain more recognition then sure, but not every piece of software is motivated by those goals.  Somebody has to make the ""better"" even if they're not the ones to benefit, and many are fine with that.  That's particularly true in open source.<p>Assuming a particular motivation for the OP, and then insulting them based on that assumption, is just wrong.  In fact, I think some might even see it as hitting someone when they're down - i.e. bullying.  People who've gained some prominence in the community should try to do better.",1366895062

My advice would be to develop which ever idea you think is best, don't worry about advertising revenue now, and then try to raise funding. Then you'll get a salary to support the fam.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to startups going the self-funded route and pursuing revenue from the get go, but that's almost impossible with ads. If you really don't want to raise money, go with the best idea you have that has some other business model.",1210132543

Plus, it isn't  easy to get that many followers.  You can't just sign up and make it happen. I think the number of followers would be of value from at least an advertising perspective.",1210131420

Primary is the source itself: J Engine (portable C); Windows GUI support (C++); and Unix GUI support (Java).

183108,comment,182425,182581,0,0,mindslight,,,"> The error is that we ""as a society"" don't make choices. Individuals do. If I thought a conspiracy of government officials and oligarchs were making work choices for ""society"" as a whole, then I might be as offended as the author.<p>But that's basically the official policy. When the federal reserve lowers interest rates, it creates a supply of cheap money which is then invested, driving up the demand for labor (and higher wages encouraging individuals to meet the demand). As the federal reserve adjusts interests rates with the goal of sustaining ""full employment"", a closed loop is created.",1210129806

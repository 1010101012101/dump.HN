It&#x27;s ugly, but so is all low-level optimized code.<p>OK. I guess if there is a way for the optimizing backend output which unboxing failed it would satisfy me. For us native programmers having tagged pointers that are often optimized, but we don&#x27;t really know when, is a concern. \nMight be irrational terror for sure like with the GC fear.\nSo FP languages proponents need to explain more why and how these features like GC/uniform representation/whatever are not a speed impediment (imho).<p>> And many languages trade off between uniform access, byte-string representation, and Unicode. Haskell just splits each use case into its own type.<p>True and this can indeed be contentious where this isn&#x27;t done.",1406368759

8089320,comment,8088842,8089269,4,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"PAQ (particularly ZPAQ) is pretty good at most things because it selects the model which works best. Variants of PAQ tend to be the Hutter Prize winners (paq<i>h) - PPM derivatives are generally excellent at text, source code, HTML, and things with that kind of word-like symbol distribution (which is why PPMd.H in particular is used by RAR and 7-zip for text compression, although RAR selects it automatically and unfortunately 7-zip doesn&#x27;t seem to, probably because of the extra RAM overhead for decompression that PPMd.H introduces).<p>However, PAQ tends to be </i>really* slow, largely <i>because</i> it tries more things. It&#x27;s highly tunable, but people who aren&#x27;t compression geeks tend to not want to tune their compression. Presets are available.<p>That&#x27;s pretty much why it hasn&#x27;t caught on - speed. There may be some hybrid approaches that deliver a better compromise between context mixing&#x27;s effectiveness and dictionary coding&#x27;s speed and memory usage: I guess you could argue LZMA, bringing a Markov-chain algorithm into the mix, is one such, in a way. Sort of.<p>I&#x27;m also a little antsy about ZPAQ formats containing bytecode descriptions of the decompression algorithm needed, and are, broadly speaking, executable (and in some cases, <i>are</i>). That seems like the kind of thing that may invite security problems if approached without due caution.",1406367948

The plan might not last long before the law is changed.  And you might be asked to repay some tax.<p>Tax avoidance is the use of bizarre systems that serve no purpose but to reduce tax burden.  Starbucks is a great example here.  They have a gajillion shops in the UK; they employ many people; they&#x27;re expanding.  By any sensible analysis Starbucks is a sucessful company in England.  Yet the shops make no profit.  The only reason they make no profit is because they have to buy buy coffee beans from one supplier, and that supplier prices the beans very much higher than other bean roasters.  That bean-roasting supplier happens to be based in a tax haven.<p>Can you agree that there is a difference between &quot;not paying tax that you legally do not need to&quot; and &quot;going out of your way to create bizarre semi-legal schemes in the hope that you get away with it; especially taking into account the numbers of people working to create tax avoidance schemes and people working to investigate such schemes&quot;.<p>The other moral point is that these companies make full use of the products of the tax system - they would most certainly call the police if one of their offices was burgled - and so they should consider making sensible donations to that tax system.<p>(And before anyone mentions wage taxes or sales taxes: these are paid by the employees or by the customers, and merely collected by the company).",1406367433

That that row is tagged &quot;vault&quot; vs. &quot;demand deposit&quot; doesn&#x27;t particularly obligate them to segregate 100 BTC and cold store them.

If people knowingly want to part with their money, and you&#x27;re not mis-representing things in order to convince them of it, then no amount of &quot;moral&quot; arguments will make what you&#x27;re doing dirty or immoral.

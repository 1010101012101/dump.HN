The proof is a simple application of pumping lemma[1]: we want to show that language { a^p: p prime } is not regular. Suppose it is. By pumping lemma we have numbers N, n >= 1, such that for every k >= 0, we have a^(N+nk) in our language. But that means that for every k, N+nk is prime, and it fails for k = N, since N+nN = N(1+n) is not a prime, since both N and 1+n are greater than 1.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumping_lemma_for_regular_languages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumping_lemma_for_regular_langu...</a>",1324845995

Publicly available. In addition, we could require all politicians to wear their sponsors' logos (just like a motorsport driver) when they appear in public.<p>Representative democracy is an abstraction that tries to hide what's going on behind the scenes. Let's rip off the hood and make the abstraction leak wherever possible.<p>Also, I don't necessarily think spreading outright lies should be considered free speech, just as much as I don't consider propaganda or hate speech to be free speech. I don't think we should forbid it but I refuse to categorize it as ""worthy of protection"".",1324843433

Fortunately for me I own a small hosting company with roughly 1500 or so domain names that I will do a bulk transfer too after the xmas holiday.  These are domain names I mainly control as a consultant for other companies (my clients)...  This ought to get interesting when I begin pulling the trigger.  About 6 years ago I did something similar to move away from NetSol and they attempted to block this; making it very difficult to close my accounts.",1324843345

At first it was damn strange for me how open you were - it was like, doesn't she know <i>you're not supposed to do that</i>?<p>But over time, it became a breath of fresh air. I love how our generation is opening up and cutting out the idea that we have to be perfect, or at least pretend to be. It's cool seeing professional athletes like Zack Grienke open up about what they've got going on. It's nice to see your story, your candidness.<p>There's downsides! Oh, I know, I'm well-aware. But I feel so honest, so alive, so unvarnished.<p>Can I be a little raw and crass for a moment?<p>So I worked feverishly today, and then went to a high-class whorehouse for consolidated intense relaxation. It was fantastic, I was walking on air when I left.<p>I know I'm not supposed to <i>say that</i>, I know it offends a lot of people... but... it's true. I have a variety of people I work with, partner with, and so on. Some of my staff are devoutly Christian, I've got people who are hardcore party-goers, I've got a flamingly gay world-traveling athiest working on one project (even gay people would say ""wow, he's <i>really</i> gay, y'know?) and... I think everyone knows I mean them no harm when I put my view out.<p>Maybe strangers don't know. But wow, it's so liberating to be honest. I feel so unchained. Yeah, I'm a mess in some ways. But <i>everyone</i> is a mess in some ways, and everyone keeps it bottled up and pretends they're not a mess. Yuck. I love this honesty thing. Thank you for your honesty.

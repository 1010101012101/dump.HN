A friend of a friend said:&quot;It would be nice if X existed.&quot; At first, I didn&#x27;t want to do it. After a few days I thought that it would be interesting to do some PHP coding (this was in 2006) and tried a few things. I posted the prototype in a forum related to the niche, the first 100 users came, they gave suggestions and I kept improving it and it kept growing.<p>Only after 5 years did I turn it into a business. Until then, it was something like a project for me as a student.<p>So, there really was no formal process. I did a few things right, I learned a lot along the way, but there&#x27;s nothing to copy or to model. It was mostly luck and an opportunity I took.<p>Edit: I once read: &quot;The perfect time to start a company that is successful in 2013 was 2007&quot; or something in that sense. This is what happened. I took this opportunity. I would do things differently today, but to be honest, I have the same hard time as everybody else to come up with a new business and a viable idea. Because everything changed since 2006. So what I did right back then wouldn&#x27;t work now, process-wise.<p>Still, I did a few things right I guess that are still valid in 2013. Mostly: I concentrated on important things, I do customer support myself, I listen to people, I&#x27;m friendly, I help people solve their problems. I care about them, about their privacy and do everything to protect it. I write emails that take me 30 minutes if it&#x27;s necessary. Why? Because I only get a handful of emails per day. It&#x27;s not scalable but then, it doesn&#x27;t have to be. I do some SEO and rank well for my niche keywords. About 50-70% is word of mouth.<p>What I don&#x27;t do: I don&#x27;t have a blog, I didn&#x27;t integrate any social network crap, I don&#x27;t use Google Analytics or any other fancy third-party application that must be included via JS. I use Piwik that I check occasionally (sometimes every week, sometimes only every few months). I don&#x27;t have big metrics. My most imporant metrics are: Money earned per week/month. Amount of active (paid) users. Signups per week.<p>Edit2: My product has nothing to do with PHP and doesn&#x27;t target IT people. Just in case this is misinterpreted. I mention PHP only, because people on HN hate PHP that much and sometimes forget that it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s PHP or anything else, as long as it pays the bills. PHP is fast, PHP is reliable and I get shit done in PHP. That&#x27;s why I use PHP.",1385736525

Native (iOS/Android) with some content in webviews<p>3. PhoneGap (iOS & Android, cross platform, same app)<p>4. Xamarin (iOS)<p>5. RubyMotion (iOS)<p>I recommend 1 & 2 if you have the resources (time to learn native iOS/Android or an experienced developer available). A good approach is to write all the structure/navigation natively and individual content in webviews. LinkedIn&#x27;s mobile team uses this technique exhaustively.<p>Xamarin and RubyMotion (4 & 5) are both great 2nd choices if you dislike the Objective-C / Java languages or your team is well versed in C#/ruby, but you&#x27;ll still have to learn the SDKs. There isn&#x27;t much you can&#x27;t do in these frameworks that you could do &quot;natively&quot;, since you&#x27;re still hooking into the native runtimes (loosely speaking). Xamarin is a bit more stable than RubyMotion, imho.<p>I&#x27;d stay away from PhoneGap if possible. My main takeaway is that &quot;write once, run everywhere, sdk agnostic&quot; is a pipe dream. You&#x27;ll be disappointed when you&#x27;re investing tons of time in the last 10-20% of development, working with fringe cases on different platforms. If you find yourself considering PhoneGap, consider whether or not being on the App Store is necessary at all, or if you can get away with a standard web app through the browser.",1385736414

I like thinking in actors and mailboxes rather than in goroutines and channels. Actor+mailbox somehow matches my world view better rather than nameless goroutines.<p>* no supervision control of goroutines -- I haven&#x27;t found a way to kill, or watch for death of a goroutine externally. This would make it easy to build a supervision tree and add some fault tolerance features to the language. channel ping plus timeout could mimic it but seems kind of a hack.<p>* gc stops the world sometimes.<p>* goroutines share the heap, I wish heap sharing was an option one had to enable and by default it would work like Erlang (or Dart Isolates). As concurrent systems (which supposedly Go is the prime target for) grow it is really fault tolerance that kills them. One goroutines, killing the whole system with thousands of concurrent requests is so C++-ish, I wish it was more Erlang-ish.",1385736300

I use Cordova as a wrapper around HTML5.<p>My conclusions:<p>- HTML5 is great for custom UI and prototyping. You can do that right in your browser, no compilation needed. And Web Inspector is _awesome_. Experimenting with UI in ObjC (or Photoshop, IMO) is PITA, but Web Inspector makes it super nice and easy.<p>- Native is great for using native UI. I had to recreate not just the appearance, but the behavior of a lot of elements. It takes a lot of time to get right.<p>- I don&#x27;t know about Java and Android, but ObjC is a poor language. I used CoffeeScript for the project and it was a far superior experience.<p>- Debugging JavaScript on Android sucks<p>- Debugging JS on iOS is pretty good, but it&#x27;s still more painful than using Xcode&#x27;s debugger. OTOH, JS is harder to _really_ break. If there&#x27;s an error, _something_ won&#x27;t work, but the app won&#x27;t crash. Not always true with ObjC.<p>- interfacing with native capabilities is hard. iOS&#x27;s WebView doesn&#x27;t expose direct access to the JavaScript VM, so the bridge between two worlds is based on callbacks. Async is much uglier and more error-prone.<p>- Cordova sucks balls<p>- you can get pretty damn close with how fast and smooth the app works with CSS&JS, but you can never quite get there. Lots of little bugs and quirks, which are hard to fix.<p>- it sucks not to have control over how things are rendered. You can make wonders with `-webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0);`, but it&#x27;s not perfect.",1385735630

With native you implement the functionality of your app, and don&#x27;t have to invent views management, list views, notifications, events management, gesture recognisers, etc.<p>There was a post (by sencha, iirc) where they brag how they managed to make html version of FB faster.

Backend... less so, but most people do full stack these days anway. So if you do web, you do people (or you are unlikely to be good).<p>But the technology behind web is easier. That isn&#x27;t to say web is easy - it is two problems, a people problem and a technical problem. But you are writing in a dynamic language which doesn&#x27;t appear to be sentient and hate you, and a lot of the more technical stuff gets abstracted away.<p>In 1995, you wrote some C, you wrote some assembely, and as an afterthought, you made an interface featuring horrible IT guy art and an unforgiving number of buttons.<p>There was a people problem, but the engineers either ignored or didn&#x27;t notice it. When someone did - MS windows, iphones... well they made a lot of money because caring about user experience was actually a diferentiator back then.<p>There are still fields of software for people that don&#x27;t like people. They work in software research, on embedded systems. If they are not so good technically, maybe they work on government / defence software where the user matters less and the ecosystem still uses C++. A lot of them have moved into mathmatical modelling and HFT, because the money is really good there.<p>There are other reasons for the change - I think Redit and co have created a cultural change.

6819469,comment,6818556,6818556,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"I like some of what this essay has to say, but generally disagree with this:<p><i>When you emerge into daylight, you might well discover that you&#x27;re a hundred pounds overweight, your underwear is older than the average first grader, and judging from the number of pizza boxes lying around, it must be spring already.</i><p>That&#x27;s depressing, and unhealthy. Programming <i>well</i> is a marathon, not a sprint. Neglecting your health burns you in the long run. In fact, programming is so mentally intense that you probably shouldn&#x27;t be doing it more than 50 hours per week. A couple weeks at 65-80 is fine, if you&#x27;re in the zone and truly engaged, but you&#x27;re probably not doing useful work if you&#x27;re on your sixth 90-hour week in a row. In fact, I think the people who can truly sustain a solid 70 hpw (much less 90-110+, because long hours get exponentially more difficult) are less than 1% of the population, and not the most enviable for a bunch of reasons I won&#x27;t get into.<p>Also, the ability to get to 100 pounds overweight without only mild loss of professional and social status (instead of the severe loss women face) is a male privilege of sorts.<p>I agree with the general message. Flow is important, and The Game is pretty engrossing. I had a few months in a managerial position (a while ago) where I never wrote real code and the itch to do something real got very strong. Coding is more fun than a video game, if you do it right. But I can&#x27;t agree that neglect of health is a good thing (I&#x27;ve seen its end-stage, which is pretty horrible) and, if you let that sort of thing fester, it will make your work worse in the long run.",1385735141

6819452,comment,6818371,6818879,15,0,jerf,,,"That <i>is</i> a problem that interfaces can solve. I agree it&#x27;s a bizarre oversight that the logging package doesn&#x27;t define an interface, but it&#x27;s also one very easily corrected, and since interfaces are implicitly fulfilled, the standard logger trivially meets the interface you define. We&#x27;ve found there&#x27;s a few other places in the core libraries we expect an interface and there isn&#x27;t one, but, again, fortunately it is trivially fixable.<p>I&#x27;m actually finding Go to be one of the testable imperative languages I&#x27;ve used. This isn&#x27;t everything I&#x27;ve developed for it, but this is one of the fundamental tricks: <a href=""http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2923"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2923</a><p>Also remember that global variables are still Bad. If you&#x27;ve got a global Logger, you&#x27;ve already lost. Fortunately, struct embedding seriously mitigates the pain of passing things around and using them. While this will probably break apart into multiple objects as I continue developing, I&#x27;ve taken to having this sort of structure:<p><pre><code>    type Services struct {\n        *logging.logger // actually our custom logging package\n        database.Database // locally defined interface\n        connections.Tracker // registers connections or whatever\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI then have my primary objects embed a Services instance, so logging is just &quot;obj.Error(...)&quot;. I pair that with a function that can construction a &quot;null&quot; Services, with a logger that doesn&#x27;t log, a connection registration system that doesn&#x27;t register, etc. Combined with what I linked, this enables even rather complicated interactions to be feasibly tested in relative isolation. I&#x27;ve also created some basic mock objects for some of the objects that may for instance assert that the Logger is called when expected, etc.<p>Technically none of this is impossible in other imperative OO languages, but Go has just enough twists on things to make it qualitatively easier, mostly implicit satisfaction of interfaces, which has had consequences beyond what I&#x27;ve expected. Embedding has had surprisingly pleasant consequences too; complicated objects can be <i>safely</i> built up with rich interfaces that do <i>not</i> require you to hardwire them together, or give you excessive access to the internals of the bits.",1385734886

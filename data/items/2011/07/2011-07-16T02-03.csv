We were also selected to present at International Startup Festival in Canada - http://www.startupfestival.com/en/. There's been pretty good investor interest (both fm US and Indian investors.. we've been approached by some really big time folks) - which we are now actively exploring. Moreover, we have insanely rocking superstar entrepreneurs / investors from silicon valley advising us!<p>Our beta list is steadily growing, and we're gearing up for the beta launch. We already have a strongly validated alpha and we have spent a lot of time talking to our users (1-1) to understand their needs in great detail. So, we have lots to do now! And that's why, we're looking for team members... perhaps you!<p>This is not just a cool product we're building, but a viable business too. It's $11 billion industry and rapidly growing, and money is already being made!<p>We're looking for someone who has 
(i.) some knowledge of graph theory and algorithms, coupled with 
(ii.) background in Computer Science, be it in the form of hobby programming, involvement in open source projects or something equivalent. Having built an app from scratch is a big huge plus! 
We don't care if you don't have zillions of years of experience, or if you are not familiar with the tools and technologies we use (CakePHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, social network APIs), so long as you are superbly confident that you can pick them up quickly, and write + push code to live site!<p>We are looking for someone who shares our entrepreneurial passion, is ambitious, open to ideas, has an appetite for startup roller-coaster ride. Our product Hachi stands for ""smart + providing utility + fun + trustworthy""... and we want our team to embody the same values. No compromises on this one! We are highly focused on building a rockstar team.<p>We want someone who can commit full time. This role will be a combination of salary + equity (we believe in what we're doing, and so even in our bootstrapped stage, we're up for paying salary).<p>We're a US incorporated company, but currently we're based out of Bangalore (India) - and we want the team to be co-located, so the role will be based out of Bangalore. We know it's not THE silicon valley, but the startup scene is quite vibrant here - I was based out of valley for the last 7 years, and was pleasantly surprised to see lot of startup momentum in Bangalore, when I moved back few months ago. Moreover, the product we're building and the response we've been getting keeps us charged up all the time ..well, almost all the time :) ..we do have our superbly low moments too!! So, if you're up for some fun while building a cool product that can potentially change our lives (hopefully, for the better!), then do give this a serious thought.<p>Check out our splash page and, if it piques your interest, ping me (email on my profile page here), and Ill provide you with an invite code to play with the app. And if you enjoy playing with it, and have ideas on how you can take it notches above, then lets talk! I'll be in NYC & SF next week - so if you're interested and happen to be there, I'd love to meet up.<p>Ping right away, if this is YOU! Dying to hear from you!!",1310784465

Putting in a requirement - Do not play songs with the word Primus in the metadata - would probably ""accidentally"" keep out some cover bands' songs that are legally uploaded, but it would do a very good job of keeping out most Primus music.  Even if that music showed up, but without the metadata, nobody would be finding it in searches, which also helps eliminate the use of that illegal content.  What you do, frankly, is close to the legal minimum because the business wouldn't exist if you did a better job at it.<p>Within 5 minutes I can go find music on Grooveshark that is there illegally.  It ought to be pretty easy for you to do the same queries and prevent that from happening.  Would you prevent legal music?  Yes.  What is more important - that some cover band be allowed to post their music, or that Primus be allowed to retain their rights?  Particularly when you consider that nobody is coming to Grooveshark to hear covers of Primus.<p>I'm not saying that operating legally in the music industry is easy - far from it.

If a commodity money is backed by a state, it shouldn't act differently from fiat money (assuming its price is stable enough to act as a useful ""unit of account"", which for a weighted <i>basket</i> of commodities shouldn't be difficult. If the commodity basket is the particular one specified by the CPI, then its real value will be a constant by definition!) You wouldn't trade in pork bellies, but convenient ""dollars"" with a well-understood and stable value, pegged to a fixed ratio of a commodity (X pork bellies). E.g. historically, 1 USD was defined as 1.505 grams gold (1900-1933). And most transactions wouldn't involve physical delivery of a commodity, just paper bills.<p>You have a good point that if there are multiple currencies (say they are privatized), then there could be major confusion as to how to denominate debts, which currencies are acceptable payment, people being confused by different units and fluctuating exchange rates, etc. Like dealing with international currencies, except everywhere.",1310783923

That competing for being an alpha male/reproducing is just something society has to have and encourage to exist. It's like going to high school; it's boring, it's not that much fun but it's one of those things you have to do.<p>There are three main ways society can encourage reproduction:<p>1) Fear. Mainly fear of appearing a loser if you don't reproduce/have sex. Peer-pressure in other words.<p>2) Positive reinforcement. Making sex more fun: sex-toys, apparel, Viagra, etc.<p>3) Eliminate alternatives. Eliminating/making illegal things that are better than sex/lead to decreased interest in sex -- like drugs that cause pleasure greater than orgasm.<p>I was asking myself lately,  ""Why, stereotypical nerds, being so smart and intelligent don't have much sex?"" And then it hit me: because sex's pleasure is overstated through propaganda. It's a physical activity that requires immense effort and concentration, carries a ton of risk, and doesn't offer enough in return.<p>You know why dumbest people often have more children? Because to exert so much effort on so little in return means you have to fall into the traps of advertisement, or just do it out of culture. If you stop to think what exactly makes you want sex, you'll probably never stress over having sex again, just like you don't stress over not drinking beer if everyone's drinking it.",1310782818

2769894,comment,2768679,2769331,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"This is actually a somewhat unlikely scenario. Just as there is 'security theater' there is also 'terrorism theater' - an act of destruction that gains worldwide attention and draws attention the particular cause the terrorist cares about and wants publicity for, be it positive or negative. The essential goal of terrorism is to force people to pay attention by causing something so horrifying that it is guaranteed to get news coverage. This is much more effective against civilians and in peaceful countries, because lots of journalists will show up with cameras - unlike a war zone, where only a few will venture in and where the coverage is likely to vary widely in subject matter and tone. Airplanes and other forms of mass transit are particularly effective because they frighten people enough to create a lot of political pressure, and they're visually spectacular. Likewise bombs in popular or famous locations.<p>Now a bomb in an airport is much less effective, for a few reasons. Of course, it will kill and injure a lot of people, but it won't create the desired spectacle. Access to the scene is going to be limited by the building's geography and the additional security, so there won't be any strong defining images that capture the essence of the whole event. Bloody and tearful civilians get photographed, of course, but in the collective imagination one group of victims/survivors looks very much like another. People will remember that something bad happened, and where, but it won't be very distinct from similar events that are distant in time or place. Secondly, it would be possible to cut the risk of a repeat incident substantially by requiring advance check-in or use of a credit card to purchase tickets, and prohibiting any entry to the airport facilities proper without a ticket. This is not far away from what already happens with a boarding pass, but is that little bit more traceable and thus raises the barriers to entry. Third, a plane is a confined space with a fairly narrow margin of safe operation. There is nowhere to flee too if a terrorist loses his nerve (and a higher probability of getting caught once the plane lands), and even if the terrorist fails the 'mission' is not a total bust because there will be panic and an emergency landing, which will at least rattle people. In an airport, a hesitant individual may simply give up and leave before blowing himself up, or if his fear betrays him and others become suspicious, he may find himself the lonely occupant of an empty space before being shot or set upon or (worst of all, from the terrorist planner point of view) setting off his bomb and not killing or seriously injuring anyone but himself. Flying is unusual enough for most people, and the awareness of terrorism sufficiently high, that people traveling in airports tend to have elevated levels of alertness.<p>If the goal of terrorism was simply to kill as many people as possible, then there are abundant opportunities for doing so that are easier than an airport, and arguably more frightening. There are larger and denser crowds of people all over the place where a terrorist could cause carnage with ease. But they lack the visual distinctiveness, the element of captivity, and the mobility that mean not only could you get blown up IN a plane, you could walking along minding your own business and have one fall out of the sky on top of you.<p>As for the structural considerations, consider that takeoff and landing are the most dangerous parts of a plane flight, on average. Airports are thus more likely to experience a plane-size accident than almost any other location. Planners and architects are well aware of this, and the structures and materials used to build the airport are rated to withstand a higher level of destructive force than normal buildings. An explosion in a massive terminal is likely to result in less damage, not more, because the explosive force will be dissipated in the cavernous space. It's explosions in small confined spaces that are really worrying, because then the pressure wave doesn't have many options about where to go and bounces around within the space reducing everything to small fragments. For the simplest possible demonstration of this, take a tweezers and hold a match in a flame; it flares up and goes out. Now take another match, wrap the head in tinfoil, and repeat. Wear safety glasses.",1310782067

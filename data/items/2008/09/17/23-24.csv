The relationship of operations in the retina to operations in the cortex is unknown.  (It seems, actually, that cortex <i>reimplements</i> certain retinal functions, e.g. directional selectivity, for unknown reasons.)  Similarly, IIRC, the time difference between a sound arriving at the two ears is thought to be computed by the olivary nucleus (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_olivary_nucleus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_olivary_nucleus</a>), a specialized brainstem structure.<p>So what do the retina and the brainstem have to do with the cortex?  Even if you accept (3), you can ask the same question about cerebellum.<p>In the link you give, Kurzweil says that these studies show that ""it is clear that we can emulate the functionality of brain regions with less computation than would be required to simulate the precise nonlinear operation of each neuron and all of the neural components (that is, all of the complex interactions that take place inside each neuron).""<p>I hope he's right; but the evidence he gives is pretty thin.<p>[ edit to make each item on the list have its own line ]",1221693357

Greatness worthy of respect? Yes. Amazing deeds and ideas? Yes. But perfection? No. If you or anyone else has a different concept of what a word means than its actual meaning then that is up to you. But it doesn't make that concept correct and certainly doesn't make that concept easy to communicate to others who do not share your non-standard definition.<p>If one has to redefine the meaning of a word for ones philosophy to make sense, then maybe it's just best to use a different word and save everyone some time.<p>It appears that the meaning of the word ""perfect"" seems to be very elastic indeed, as it relates to it's use in Objectivism.

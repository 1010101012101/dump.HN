If the founders are willing to work for peanuts, then it's the investors prerogative to keep them that way.  No foul there.<p>However for any VC to <i>ever</i> utter the words ""just the founder"" in the founder's presence is a massive managerial fail.  Founders are not the people who you want to ""put in their place"", they are the ones who make the company succeed.  Even if you think you don't need them anymore, why would so blithely burn a connection with a talented entrepreneur?",1274374601

It really feels like a giant misrepresentation of the truth.<p>Berkshire was not hiding the fact they owned these derivatives. Buffett has talked about thm many times and defends purchasing this specific set of derivatives as having been ""mispriced at inception"" which I think is the most basic plan of all investing, right. Buy low, sell high.<p>As to the lobbying of congress, I would do the same thing, and you would too. When the derivitives contracts were drawn up Berkshire offered both a collatoralized and uncollatoralized option for the contract. The other parties would have paid a higher premium to Berkshire for the collatoralized contract, so they selected to forgo collatoral. Now, after the fact congress is going to step in and demand the contract have collatoral?<p>If I borrow money unsecured, I'm going to pay a higher interest rate. It would be extremely crappy to come in half way through the loan and demand that I put my house up ad collatoral. Now I have all the risk, and didn't even get to benefit from the lower I intrest rate at inception.<p>THAT'S what he's lobbying against.<p>And ontop of all of that, Buffett has said that if congress does include retroactive collatoralization, he will just pay it and his business will still be fine. So where's the fall from grace?<p><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=aZcI_iSCOUWM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=aZcI...</a>",1274374507

It was not a <i>terrible</i> desktop OS, but Linux is just so much easier to deal with.  apt-get blows ports (and pkg-add, hahaha) out of the water.<p>I also used it for my mail/web server, and it didn't seem to be the path of least resistance.  With Debian, I spent about 10 minutes configuring Apache + fastcgi and exim + spamassassin + clamav.  With OpenBSD, I spent days setting it up (I felt like the first person in the world to ever deploy a FastCGI app on OpenBSD), but the result was much more secure.  Each web app ran as its own user in a chroot with no view of the shared filesystem beyond /tmp, and the webserver ran as its own user, also in a chroot.  Very secure, but still felt flaky to me.  My mailserver never worked right.  (The ""world's most secure operating system"" uses sendmail!?)<p>pf is just wonderful compared to iptables, though, so I would definitely use OpenBSD for anything routing-related.

I credit Wolfram Alpha as the reason I was able to go through Calc II, III, IV, and Differential Equations this year.<p>I'm able to grasp advanced math concepts, but I have trouble actually working math problems on paper as math <i>classes</i> are usually taught:  I understand the concepts and why we're doing things but I accidently transpose symbols, make algebra mistakes, and write down arithmetic wrong.  I get distracted so easily that I'll stop and start 10 times on one problem because I keep forgetting that I'm supposed to be working on a problem, when an idea about something unrelated pops into my head.  It's just the way my brain is wired - I don't think linearly, my mind is constantly going down multiple parallel threads at once like a Best Buy full of TV's tuned to different channels.  I think I have severe ADHD and a very mild form of dyslexia, but I've never been diagnosed - when I was in school, teachers didn't understand that you can be both gifted and impaired at the same time, just in different ways.<p>So throughout all my math courses it's been constantly frustrating to intuitively grasp the concept many times faster than the other students, and yet see them outpace me with rote mechanization while I struggle to not get the symbols in my equations mixed up.<p>That's why Wolfram Alpha has been a godsend - I can use it as a sort of ""debugger"" for my math work; it helps me figure out where I'm making mistakes in my mechanical manipulation of the symbols.

There's not really any such thing in Ruby - everything is an object, but some objects - numbers, booleans, nil - are immutable.<p>When you copy an object, all you do is copy its set of instance variables, which are just references to other objects. For an array, the instance variables are its set of indexes, which again are just references. Copying an array just means making a new list of references, but the objects they point to remain unmodified and uncopied.<p>Consider:<p><pre>\narray = [""foo""]\ncopy = array.dup\n</pre><p>array and copy are independently mutable - modifying the index in one does not affect the indexes in the other - but they still both contain references to the single string ""foo"". Thus:<p><pre>\ncopy.first.gsub! /foo/, ""bar""\n</pre><p>modifies the string referenced by copy, which is the same string referenced by array. So array becomes [""bar""].<p>If you want a true deep copy, do something like this:<p><pre>\ndef deep_copy(object)\n  case object\n  when Array\n    object.map { |item| deep_copy(item) }\n  when Hash\n    object.inject({}) do |hash, (key,value)|\n      hash[deep_copy(key)] = deep_copy(value)\n      hash\n    end\n  # handle other data structures if need be\n  else\n    object.respond_to?(:dup) ? object.dup : object\n  end\nend\n</pre>",1274371755

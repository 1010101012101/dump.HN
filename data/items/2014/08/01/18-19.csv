I would argue that every company not hiring remotely isn&#x27;t hiring top talent. Every company touts they hire top talent. The truth is, we can&#x27;t all be in the 99%. When your pool of applicants is reduced by locality, you&#x27;re already losing out in the talent wars.<p>If you&#x27;re constraining yourselves by location, you&#x27;ve already lost out on a global market full of talent. I&#x27;m surprised we still have this stigma and belief that hiring local means you&#x27;re cultivating a particular culture. The truth of the matter is you can have a culture based on a hugely diverse pool of employees. Take Github, for instance, whom I believe does an excellent job of this.",1406919536

Of course any code that can be written in a type-safe manner in Haskell can be written  in another language to perform the exact some machine operations.  The point is that the compiler guarantees that this code will never break as long as the code compiles.  In less type-safe languages you simply don&#x27;t have these guarantees, no matter how careful you are, eventually someone will come along and break an assumption that kept the original code working.",1406919531

Generally, compiling GCC to target another architecture involves not only recreating most of the root directory structure (notably include files) of the target on the host, but also compiling libc, bintools, and a few other more obscure libraries.  And this all needs to be done in the correct order (which involves something like compiling half of libc before compiling GCC, and compiling the rest of libc afterward).<p>Maybe in 3.x and MIPS it &quot;just worked&quot;.  My experience is 4.x and Tilera.  Myself and another engineer dumped a week into that sinkhole before giving up.<p>Clang/LLVM on the other hand… ./configure && make && make install.

That said, it has it&#x27;s problems: many people dislike the &quot;brackets everywhere&quot; syntax and it&#x27;s compatibility with C constrains the compiler (you can actually write C in the middle of your Objective-C, move pointers around, etc.) In Objective-C, you can write code that looks fine at compile-time but still crashes the app, which is bad for us developers and bad for iOS as a platform.<p>Swift can be used to write first-class, native apps just like Objective-C and even used alongside Objective-C in the same project. It includes features borrowed from other modern languages (Rust, Go etc.), like generics, tuples and explicit optionals. Many of the features of Swift are designed to ensure that the compiler can catch issues at compile-time. It&#x27;s much more difficult to write code that will crash a Swift app.<p>As a seasoned Objective-C developer I&#x27;ll probably reminisce about the good old days when I swizzled methods and did all sorts of bad things, but it&#x27;s a good move for the platform :-)",1406918796

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We are going to Portugal in September! Want to come?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that.

Very little of it is truly a black box, the spec is extremely readable and precise about the things it covers, IL disassembly is extremely readable, IL disassembly fed through a decompiler like ILspy/dotPeek is doubly readable, debugging is straightforward even without symbols, and recompilation/patching is trivial because everything is well-specified and there&#x27;s a robust open source library for it. (Even if there wasn&#x27;t a library, you could just use the standard ildasm/ilasm pair.)<p>Oh, and you can compile native no-kidding C/C++ to .NET targeting the same instruction set and get all the benefits of the above.

Information flow does great things, but without resistance it can cause serious damage.<p>The internet greatly lowered the resistance. Search engines lowered it even more. I fear that if we do not find some way to increase the resistance, the problem will be addressed at the other end by changing the laws about what goes in the public record.<p>For instance, maybe arrests will no longer go into the public record--only convictions. That way, people who are arrested and later released due to lack of evidence don&#x27;t have the arrest following them around.

This alone means you can represent things like Maybe without any trouble, whereas in C/Java, you&#x27;d have to use casting, explicit tagged unions, or the visitor pattern. ML has largely the exact same features as Haskell, except you have to explicitly say which module you&#x27;re using, instead of the typeclass system doing it for you. Do you also &quot;get&quot; ML? It sounds more like you are claiming to &quot;get&quot; some sort of theory, rather than Haskell or ML, which are trivial, but you make it sound like you need to be somehow enlightened to understand.<p>The only hard part I ever found in Haskell is lazy evaluation, which to me is just another type of magic which nobody gets, just like the Java Memory Model.

8121819,comment,8118678,8120939,0,0,BugBrother,,,"TL;DR: I read two points. One is contradicted by multiple sources at Wikipedia, the other argues that everything pipy dislikes from USA can be ignored. I quit the discussion in disgust over wasted time. :-(<p>>>Yes, what I argue is that the current insurgency is supported by population of Donetsk and Luhansk regions and I&#x27;ve provided sources for that statement<p>(I don&#x27;t bother to look up your references, since it certainly won&#x27;t be from mainstream media or similar.)<p>You are contradicted by Wikipedia:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_People%27s_Republic#Public_opinion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_People%27s_Republic#Pub...</a><p><i>In a poll [..] in the first half of February 2014, 33.2% of polled in Donetsk Oblast believed &quot;Ukraine and Russia must unite into a single state&quot;.[27]<p>According to a poll [...] 66% of Donetsk residents view their future in a united Ukraine<p>A second poll conducted 26–29 March showed that 77% of residents condemned the takeover of administrative buildings, while 16% support such actions. Furthermore, 40.8% of Donetsk citizens support rallies for Ukraine&#x27;s unity, while 26.5% support rallies which are pro-Russia</i><p>And so on.<p>>> Money quote from the BBC article: &quot;the US says it has evidence that Russia has fired artillery across the border targeting Ukrainian military positions&quot;. [Etc.]<p>The first thing I check is contradicted by Wikipedia (that and its sources is a conspiracy too?).<p>The second &quot;argument&quot; I read is &quot;We can ignore that, USA just lies&quot;. (It is hardly just USA that claimed Assad used nerve gas. Any proofs against? Never mind, you read it in Putin&#x27;s media so it must be true.)<p>Seriously? That is what you have?<p>I have spent too much time on this. :-(",1406916027

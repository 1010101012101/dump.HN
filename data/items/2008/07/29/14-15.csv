260550,comment,259748,259748,0,0,time_management,,,"The issue is one of variance, not mean. When social intelligence is included, I think the average woman is probably smarter than the average man, but men have more variance and are thus more prominent at the extremes.<p>I doubt that there is a strong genetic basis for this. It is probably due, in large part, to the ways boys and girls are raised. Speaking very broadly, and acknowledging the existence of counterexamples; boys are raised to be smart, while girls are raised to be social and cooperative. This means that gifted male children can more easily zip ahead in school, but that the stragglers fall further behind in academic and social skills... and are more likely to end up becoming criminals. A lot of girls feel guilty and insecure about being ""too smart"" compared to their peers, which holds them back.",1217343497

That's what engineers do.<p>You think that social software can't be used to kill people? Do you know the number of people (mostly women) who are murdered each year by stalkers, most of whom are former lovers or spouses? Do you want to bet that <i>none</i> of those stalkers have used, say, Google to help locate their victims?<p>Do you think that having your identity stolen and your bank account drained can't lead directly to your death? What, do you live in a country where health insurance is guaranteed to all citizens? (Oh, wait -- perhaps you do. Never mind.)<p>""Toy companies""? Interesting choice of phrase. Here's what one minute's Googling found for me: A court case, <i>Estate of Matthew C. Metzgar v. Playskool, Inc</i>:<p><a href=""http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=3rd&navby=case&no=940784p"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=3rd&#...</a><p><i>the plaintiffs' expert, E. Patrick McGuire, reported for the record that in one year studied, 1988, there were eleven deaths due to aspiration of small toys or toy parts by children... the plaintiffs submitted a CPSC estimate reported in the House Congressional Record that in each year from 1980-88, an average of 3,200 small children were treated in hospital emergency rooms for toy related ingestion and aspiration injuries. The CPSC also reported that between 1980 and 1991, 186 children choked on small toys, toy parts, and other children's products.</i><p>Frankly, from the viewpoint of danger and death, the space program's engineers are wimps: They do very dangerous things, but they only endanger a handful of people at a time. A toy engineer who specifies the wrong paint can kill hundreds of babies at once. Social software is pretty safe, but if the odds that a Facebook user will be killed because of a Facebook design error are as small as one per 100 million user-years [1], the company stands to lose 1 user per year, because they have 90 million active users.<p>[1] I have no data, but I doubt the odds are that small. I'd be astonished if Facebook hadn't already been a factor in thousands of suicides, for example. One of the reasons why humans are so incredibly talented at socializing is that it's <i>fraught with peril</i>.",1217342753

Of course, I have no idea what kind of machine the published number were from, and I'm too lazy to try and install Ruby 1.9 myself, but it seems that the old 'Ruby use -> slowness' implication no longer holds.<p>[edit] Hold on, the Ruby 1.8 test, which takes 22 seconds in their figures, takes 4.3 on my machine. So that would mean Ruby 1.9 is like super-sonic ultra fast. At least on this benchmark. Which is mostly testing the speed of the sorting routine which I suppose is written in C.

It's enough to get you started, but anything even remotely complex is going to require lots of trial and error.<p>There are also quite a few little gotchas that you're left to figure out on your own. One that comes to mind as I skim through that tutorial has to do with the jsGet_ and jsSet_ methods used for implementing dynamic properties. You must implement both of them even if you only intend to use one. If you only implement the jsSet_ method it will mysteriously and silently fail. As soon as you add a corresponding jsGet_ method it magically works.<p>Don't forget about SpiderMonkey- <a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/</a>.

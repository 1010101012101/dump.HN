I don't think it detracts.<p>But if I had to choose which I think Americans should be more angry about... on one hand the US treatment of illegals and prisoners, and on the other hand the Chinese government.  I'd say that Americans should definitely be far more concerned with the former.<p>What do you get when citizens of one regime care too much about citizens in another?  Neoconservatism.  I don't think it's a coincidence that this is occurring just at the time when the US is attempting to start a trade war with China (see the tariffs started by Obama and some of the fallacious and destructive rhetoric on China's currency spouted by Paul Krugman).  How is this any different than the way Bush sold the Iraq/Afghan war -- he cited treatment of women and religious persecution and taliban censorship.<p>The ultimate result of all this is that war with China will be far more likely.  The US propaganda approach to sell war starts with feeling sorry for ""them"" because of their ""backward"" social customs, with a focus on the impact upon women... then moves to indignation, then a call to action / call to war.<p>Consider how many Americans believe strongly that going to war in Iraq and killing MILLIONS is a humanitarian improvement over Saddam's rule.  Before that we killed millions of children via sanctions.    Talk about shaping and corrupting people's minds.<p>It's always easier to see the corruption and shaping of minds from across an ocean, but that doesn't mean we're not all very corrupted and misguided here.  I think our primary responsibility is at home... let's leave the neocon warmongering to someone else and act where we have clout, not just join a big hurrah anti-China bandwagon.",1269453190

Practicality suggests taking a good payout when it appears, but of course every circumstance is different and requires individual consideration.<p>For the record, many of the listed business leaders have sold businesses, and considered selling their flagship businesses but felt the offers were too low.

Any choice a user makes for his or her own interface is their choice, and if it works for them, then who is to tell them that they are wrong? It is the usability expert's job to discover how and why a person does the things they do, and not tell them how they should be doing it.<p>For example, have you looked at some of your coworker's desktops? Everyone sets it up differently to how they prefer to work. Some have icons littering their desktop. Some have 50 apps in their taskbar. Some people like to use spotlight. Some people like to click through folders. There will always be a better way, certainly, if they so desire, but some people just like things the way they like it.

1216269,comment,1215466,1216139,0,0,luchak,,,"If you can't hire any female engineers, part of the reason may be that you don't already have any.  This can be a huge red flag.  Basically, most women applying for the job want to have some assurance that they're going to be respected and their concerns taken seriously, and the best way to demonstrate that this is true is by having some women on your team.  Otherwise, the question just sits out there:  why don't you have any?  Is it coincidence, or is there something wrong with your culture?<p>(Disclaimer:  I'm a man, but I know a lot of female engineers.  I obviously can't speak for all of them, but I've noticed some trends.)<p>Many women in engineering are wary of situations in which they won't be taken seriously.<p>For example:  say there's one guy on your team who tends to patronize women, especially ones he finds attractive.  He might not realize he does this.  You have a female engineer who's getting fed up with this behavior, and tries to gently (because she's experienced this before) point this out.  He gets defensive -- maybe he says she IS different than the other engineers, so it's only natural, maybe he just gets angry, whatever -- but, whatever he does, it's not an honest effort to improve. Later, she tries to bring this up with someone else on the team, look for help, but to everyone else he's always been a nice guy, so why is she making trouble?<p>Or let's say someone illustrates a presentation with some unfortunate images or metaphors.  (Where have we seen this before?)  Nothing flagrantly unconscionable, but, you know, kind of skirting the edge of acceptability.  This makes a female engineer uncomfortable -- the presentation marginalizes her, makes her wonder if the team sees her as a colleague or an object of desire.  Now, she knows it's going to end badly, but she mentions that it made her uncomfortable, and asks that everyone please try to avoid that mode of presentation in the future.  And suddenly everyone on the team is explaining, no, he didn't mean in THAT way, the presentation wasn't REALLY about her -- well, if you hadn't marginalized her before, now you definitely have.<p>It doesn't have to be that way.  But in some places, it is.  I've talked to women looking for software engineering jobs, and this is definitely something that gets considered.  Are other women willing to work there?  Willing to stay?  Will they have anyone to back them up when shit happens?  Because when the answer is ""no"", life sucks.<p>That said, I don't know how you hire the first one.  But you've got to be aware of these things.  You've got to make completely sure that you look like someplace where women will be respected and taken seriously, not marginalized and undermined.  Because, if a good female candidate gets a whiff of that, she's probably gone.",1269451414

Mozilla has just exhibited its first symptom of ""everything disease,"" in which it has noted the ascendancy of a competitor (Chrome), observed it, and started copying it without critically evaluating what it's copying.<p>Call it a shark jumping or whatever you will, but this to me marks the moment Firefox's post-peak status became unambiguously evident. Remember Blake Ross' philosophy that a browser should be as invisible as possible? By turning the browser UI into a dormitory wall, Firefox's gradual descent into bloat is made concrete, and its acknowledgment of Chrome as the future leader is implicit in its blind imitation of its theming system.<p>As for me, I'll stick with Safari.",1269450709

There were some worrying things in there, the foremost of which was the summary at the top of the document, written not by the US government, but by wikileaks.<p>In the summary they claimed that the US was recommending trying to fire/expose anyone who posted on wiki-leaks. However, all the article really said was ""If people are fired or exposed for publishing on wiki leaks, this will probably serve as a deterrant."" Two very different things. The summary was full of exaggerated claims like this one that really, in my opinion, made wiki-leaks look stupid.<p>The point is that wikileaks has a really awesome ideal, which is to expose bad things that are secrets. However, I worry that they are trying too hard to make everything into a conspiracy theory.<p>We need to step back and say, ""Ok, so in some movies there are conspiracy theories like the ones we're presenting. And those movies are highly entertaining because they are so ridiculous. So, do we believe this because it is true or because we want it to be true?""<p>In the end, I would really like to know if the US government, or any government, is shooting journalists. But only if it really is true. Otherwise we're no better than schizophrenic conspiracy theorists and it really won't make a difference.<p>So to tie it in, is something really up with wiki-leaks? If it is that would be good information. But I would not be surprised to find out tomorrow that these claims were highly exaggerated.",1269450281

Do you believe that you are being (or capable of being) completely objective in that evaluation?<p>In my experience, which spans 2 companies having what I judge to be remarkable software engineering talent, several women at each place feature prominently on the ""lifeboat list"". At each of those places, the stars had a much higher percentage of women than the general population at those places (though still short of 50/50). Said slightly differently, given you were a woman at one of those places, you were disproportionately likely to be a star.<p>If far fewer women than men enter computer science (at the university level), I don't think that it's likely that workplace discrimination effects are the dominant effects in the final population biases we all see. It's also no surprise to see that those who do enter are disproportionately good, because they are disproportionately likely to be intrisincally more motivated and interested in the work than the large set of ""unwashed masses [of males]"" who enter comp-sci because it's a relatively easy way to make a comfortable and secure living, even if they don't really ""care"" about it.<p>I know for my own account, I'll hire every qualified candidate I can find, without regard to gender or anything else unrelated to their prospective job performance.

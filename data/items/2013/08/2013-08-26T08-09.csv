It&#x27;s not the same as &quot;flatly.&quot; Another, and in my opinion better, interpretation is that the author is reminding the reader what eminent domain means. Let&#x27;s see if I can provide evidence for my view.<p>For reference, the original quote is &quot;The banks have filed two lawsuits alleging that the plan is an illegal abuse of eminent domain, which allows governments to seize private property for public use  like a house in the path of a new highway or a piece of land needed for a new park.&quot;<p>What do other newspapers say when they describe eminent domain?<p>1) &quot;Another option would be for the county to acquire the property under eminent domain, the process by which a municipality can take over private property for a public good, for a price.&quot; <a href=""http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/03/01/3262043_p2/um-county-clash-with-owner-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/03/01/3262043_p2/um-county-c...</a> (The private University of Miami wants to build a pedestrian bridge across a major road, where 8 students have died since 1989. The city doesn&#x27;t have the budget for an eminent domain claim.)<p>2) &quot;There&#x27;s a new partner in the mix as Aberdeen officials work to buy the now-closed federal courthouse under eminent domain, which allows government entities to take possession of private property if it is in the public interest.&quot; <a href=""http://articles.aberdeennews.com/2013-08-06/news/41141473_1_green-world-aberdeen-llc-federal-building-eminent-domain-process"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.aberdeennews.com/2013-08-06/news/41141473_1_...</a><p>3) &quot;As with the Trans-Texas Corridor, the pipeline dispute seems certain to reopen a legislative debate over eminent domain powers, which governmental entities and so-called common carriers such as utilities and pipelines use to acquire land for public projects after compensating the owner.&quot;  Fort Worth Star Telegram, reprinted in <a href=""http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/02/22/v-print/139579/texas-becomes-battlefield-in-keystone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/02/22/v-print/139579/texas-b...</a> . (On the question of if an oil pipeline counts as a common carrier under Texas law.)<p>Do note how this points out that the Supreme Court isn&#x27;t the only court to judge the constitutionality of an eminent domain seizure. State courts are also involved, and the Supreme Court usually defers to them, rather than making an overarching statement.<p>4) The Chicago Tribune articles I looked at never explain &#x27;eminent domain.&#x27; I guess they expect their readers to know that already. But quoting from <a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-01-03/news/0601030244_1_eminent-domain-adult-bookstore-projects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-01-03/news/060103024...</a> , &quot;Overwhelmingly, the eminent domain cases filed in Cook, Kane, DuPage, Lake, McHenry and Will Counties are for traditional public purposes, such as highways, schools, libraries, police stations--projects that will be owned by the government for the public use. / But a review of court cases filed since 2001 shows local governments have used eminent domain powers in many redevelopment projects where private companies end up in control of the land. / Municipal officials say this is nothing new and the current system should not be changed. Chicago area communities have used eminent domain in this way for decades to dream up new plans, they say.&quot;<p>That suggests that despite your rejection of Kelo, it is not completely out of line with the use of eminent domain over decades. Of course, it isn&#x27;t, since you&#x27;re really objecting to the court&#x27;s decision in Berman v. Parker, and not the more proximate Kelo.<p>5) In any case, &quot;public use&quot; is a very wide language, and the details are often left to the states. In Nevada, 2011, &quot;A bill by Sen. Sheila Leslie, D-Reno, would strip from state law special provisions that give mining and beet sugar producers the right to eminent domain similar to that of governments.&quot; <a href=""http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/political-eye/bill-calls-end-eminent-domain-privileges-mining-beet-industries"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/political-eye/bil...</a> . Mining justifies the law saying &quot;The eminent domain law has long recognized mining is a public interest use of the lands and is of paramount interest in Nevada,&quot; (<a href=""http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/government/comstock-residents-want-change-eminent-domain-law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/government/comstock-reside...</a> )<p>The is the whole issue, isn&#x27;t it? &quot;Public use&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to have a &quot;plain meaning&quot;, or at least not the one you think it has.<p>6) Elsewhere in the Las Vegas R-J, in an interview with a eminent domain lawyer who defends property owners:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Question: What is eminent domain?<p>Answer: It&#x27;s the power of the government to take land for public purpose.<p>Question: Does it ever go through uncontested?<p>Answer: If the government gets to the point of eminent domain, it&#x27;s contested. They can&#x27;t come to an agreement on the price of the property. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a willing buyer and a willing seller. &quot;&quot;&quot;<p>With #1, #2, and #3 I&#x27;ve shown that it&#x27;s not unusual for newspapers to give an explanation of what &#x27;eminent domain&#x27; means. The description is often something very much like &quot;allows governments to seize private property for public use&quot;. Thus, the original author&#x27;s elaboration is just that, and not seemingly a subtext supporting opposition to the seizure.<p>With #4 and #5 I point out that &#x27;public use&#x27; is not well defined, and while the land in most cases will be owned by the government, this is not universally true, with examples from two different stated. Thus, the original author elaboration of &quot;like a house in the path of a new highway ...&quot; is true, though incomplete. (The use of &#x27;like&#x27; implies that it&#x27;s incomplete.)<p>With #6 I strengthen my thesis, which is that any time there is an eminent domain challenge, it must be premised on how it&#x27;s a violation of the 5th Amendment, or more often the equivalent definition in the state law. Thus, the original author&#x27;s statement &#x27;an illegal abuse of eminent domain&#x27; describes what has to happen for any eminent domain seizure.<p>I truly fail to see how the author &quot;flatly&quot; expresses an opinion that &quot;this is scamming the Constitution&#x27;s provision for eminent domain.&quot; What I read is consistent with how eminent domain seizures are usually covered, including those where the land is taken for fully constitutional reasons (as in #2).<p>So, do elaborate how you get a very different interpretation from the same text. How are you sure that you aren&#x27;t reading your own beliefs into the article?",1377506999

6275841,comment,6275149,6275614,6,0,javajosh,,,"Thanks. But I believe that it would be more beneficial to de-gamify politics than to get elected to any particular position. One person can only do so much. The ideal situation would be to reboot the entire government, elect new people in every position, all at once. I think it&#x27;s possible, actually. But it would take a ground swell movement. I&#x27;ve shared the idea on how to do this with some friends, and they like the idea, but it&#x27;s not quite ready for public consumption. If you like I might write about it here.<p>It&#x27;s not just about elections. Hackers have a much bigger role to play in modern civics, in my opinion, than they currently have. We need to be writing open-source software platforms for city, state and even federal governments and putting them on github. It&#x27;s time for software to eat the bureaucracy. We need to have software that&#x27;s ready to use, free, and with all the features we, as technologically enlightened citizens, know that it needs. Good technology would lessen the leverage bureaucrats wield over elected officials, because it would make them easier to hold accountable and to replace.<p>(We could write open-source banking platforms too, while we&#x27;re at it. The software could have a &quot;transparency slider&quot; that banks could set according to their whim. But more importantly, it would reduce the barrier to entry for new, small banks to arise and compete with the incumbents.)<p>There is one policy change I think is very important: put limits on the complexity of law, and end what I call &quot;The Tyranny of Complexity&quot; (a take on Mill&#x27;s &quot;Tyranny of the Majority&quot;). Complexity lies at the heart of many of our political and societal ills, perhaps most directly expressed as the brutality of our justice system, a system that punishes you for years whether or not you are found guilty. But complexity is also the enemy of transparency, which hurts accountability and prevents the voting public from being informed. One simple measure, at the federal level, would be to put a hard upper-bound on the size of the United States Code - and require all new bills to be written out <i>in longhand</i> by the congressperson proposing the bill. The law of the land is too important to delegate the writing of them to underlings. Our laws should be short, to the point, and meaningful - and writing them out, pen on paper, helps to ensure that. Word-processing and hired help have made our body of law so unwieldy and impossible to comply with that hardly any law makers read the bills that they vote on. A similar rule can and should be instituted on the state and local level.",1377506359

There usually is a correlation, but with US healthcare&#x27;s opaqueness with prices, I wouldn&#x27;t make that correlation.<p>Leaving aside that, people do in fact make medical decisions based on cost. For example, for angioplasty there are two options - a medicated stent and a non-medicated, regular stent. The medicated stent is more expensive than the normal one. When it came to choosing one for my father, I chose a medicated one only because I was paying through insurance. But many of the patients out here in India don&#x27;t have insurance. In that case there is a definite probability that a lower cost one will be chosen. Another example is dialysis.

That&#x27;s the real question.<p>I work in the OS world, so I have thought about this question.<p>What I think &#x27;went wrong&#x27; with Microsoft - as is happening with other &quot;Operating Systems&quot; developers, is that they have forgotten that they are there to serve their users, not an onboard business-model.<p>Seriously, think about it.  Let us take the example of shared filesystems, a common &#x27;posession&#x27; of the OS in certain terms .. OS, filesystem, network, its all right there in the kernel .. but .. Why, on gods green earth, are we relying on &#x27;startups&#x27; and &#x27;upstarts&#x27; to deliver us peer-to-peer networking at the front-end user interface instead of actually having it, de-branded, at the operating system level as a matter of course?<p>Things Dropbox, if Microsoft was awake, wouldn&#x27;t have happened, because the peer-network shared filesystem thingy was sorted out .. in the 80&#x27;s, I might add .. and then promptly forgotten about.<p>Because the OS vendors have lost the plot on what is an operating system (hint: its the source, stupid!) and what is a &#x27;branded service which produces other revenues for the OS vendor&#x27;, and because the anti-trust thing happened, in the first place: OS vendors have lost the plot.<p>Also, the very first sign that things were going awry was when someone decided that a user operating system should not ship with its own compiler(s), onboard!  The separation of those tools, and the sheer bloat that results from not having a tight Build/OS binding, means that things got out of control on the developer, developer, developer(s), side of things, imho.<p>I think this disconnect of the User-is-the-Developer mentality from the &quot;what service is sold -outside- the box of the OS&quot; profit excuse, with the ease of device manufacturing these days, OS vendors have new challenges ahead, and the crux of the argument is this:  Its damned easy to make a new OS, for your own device, and then serve the hell out of your customers.  In a very real sense, who needs a desktop if all you have to do is turn something on, and press play, in the first place.. ?  With the way things are going, cheap light computing built-for-task is the new hotness, and .. well at least imho .. There may well come a point where the new hot OS ships with everything you could possibly need, already onboard and working, to build something new for the platform, itself.<p>Put that ethos back, and lets talk again in a year about it ..",1377504448

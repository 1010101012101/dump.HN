What's the next industry to be demonized and have punitive penalties, taxation, or nationalization applied to it? Is somebody else going to be shaken down the way BP Oil was even when there was no legal authority to do it [1]? What other radical changes to the economy are going to be proposed if the recovery continues to be anemic, and how many dollars are going to be vacuumed out of the private economy to accomplish these changes? How much more loan disasters have been hidden, and how will the administration react, and how many dollars will be vacuumed out of the private economy to implement the reactions? How will the government react to the oncoming pension crises, and how many dollars will be vacuumed out of the private economy to do it? By what order of magnitude will the Obama health care bill's costs be underestimated[2]?<p>It doesn't even matter whether these are true; I'm not really trying to argue these points or I'd back them up better, I'm just answering your question.

Wouldn't you prefer it thinner?<p>- Do you really need a CD drive with that laptop? Wouldn't you prefer a bigger battery and thinner?<p>- Do you really need that much RAM and CPU when apps instant-resume and you have a Flash system drive?<p>Plus, they innovate in manufacturing (unibody, advanced castings and extrusions, laser-machining) and marketing and sales (direct-to-consumer, store layouts, try-all-you-like).<p>Ok, so some of the approaches they use are bought/licensed (processors, casting tech, hardening tech) and many are out-sourced.

That indicates that most likely there will be at least a further doubling or tripling of online advertising spend.  Add in trends you see like people ditching cable (just in the bare beginning, but itunes / apple tv, netflix, roku, googletv, et al are beginning to be a real competitor for people who aren't super techy) and it's not unreasonable to assume increasing movement of tens of billions of dollars of brand ad spend online.

Wouldn't it help get a better signal-to-noise ratio in the ""new"" section?  It would also prevent ""throw spaghetti at the wall, and see what sticks"" behavior.

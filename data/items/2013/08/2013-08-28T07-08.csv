The self illusion of being able to achieve great things if you just put in the time is very difficult to overcome. To me I believe that the difficulty comes from a mix of complacence & fear of discomfort.<p>One thing that still bugs me to this day, is why this types of issues seem to be more prevalent in the software industry than anywhere else. Has anyone have an idea as to why this is?",1377676791

You can usually also use a different alarm sound than the default for these, so you can use something discreet for the original text arrival message, and then something more obnoxious for the repeated alarms. The best thing ever.<p>The one I use is &quot;Missed Call Reminder&quot;, but there are plenty of others.",1377676580

It is moving for the sake of moving rather than to achieve some productive effect. To me exercise is riding my to a place where I need to go rather than going by car if the distance is about right and the weather on the way out not too brutal. Walking, playing with the kids and so on. Lifting weights would indicate that I have calories to burn that go towards nothing else that helps. Usually at the end of the day I&#x27;m tired enough that I long for a bed rather than for more movement, especially not movement involving weights bought for the specific purpose of making that movement harder.<p>If I really did have energy to burn after a full day I&#x27;d probably take up some sport or spend that time and energy improving the place that I live in.",1377676233

We sell and ship from Australia:<p><a href=""http://blackboardbubbles.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blackboardbubbles.com/</a><p>(They&#x27;re bought by people for parties, weddings with photo booths, photographers, etc.)<p>I built a one page site and got a sale before we&#x27;d even created the product. At first, we relied upon a sibling with access to a college laser cutter and mailed out the product in expensive boxes.<p>Many of our adventures parallel that of Chris&#x27;. Weeks to get quotes progress on custom stickers, months of getting laser cutting quotes (including quotes from Asia or using material other than MDF), for the custom-made boxes we now use, handles, etc. We still paint the shapes by hand and cut/sand the handle shapes from broom stick dowel.<p>We&#x27;ve made some progress, but still have creases to iron out. Selling a physical product is an interesting adventure for someone who normally works on and builds virtual products/services.<p>I laughed at the photos of the room getting filled up with supplies. I&#x27;ve just installed new shelving in the garage to handle the 200 boxes we have folded and ready to go, the 600 cut-out pieces of MDF, the packing peanuts and bubble wrap, etc. Feels good to get on top of it all though!",1377674969

Even in established, DB-heavy, &quot;we have hundreds of DBAs&quot; organisations, you can&#x27;t have a porcelain schema. It evolves over time, breaks, get optimised and de-optimised.<p>The Oracle shops I&#x27;ve worked in don&#x27;t have one schema, they&#x27;ll have dozens. Usually because they can&#x27;t shoehorn emerging requirements into the databases they have. Or because of project timelines. Or they need to be performance tuned in some special way, which in the case of Oracle could be considered a dark art.<p>These orgs may have just one big data warehouse, but that becomes a dumping ground. It&#x27;s possible to do your dimensional modelling (I worked on star schemas in the past, but that&#x27;s about it) -- but it&#x27;s a big ball of mud to try and weave together.<p>Even then your OLAP is under-stress because it&#x27;s got a lot of ground to cover. Usually they start out as marketing engines, but get co-opted into all sorts of things. The most common and troublesome is regulatory reporting. Once your data warehouse gets used for something like regulatory reporting you&#x27;re a bit stuck as nobody wants to touch it.<p>Then, because point to point integrations between the databases is brittle and cost-prohibitive -- they break the golden rule and take data <i>out</i> of the OLAP and put it back into the OLTP. I won&#x27;t name names, but this is commonplace.<p>SalesForce is one of the biggest Oracle DB users (I read biggest at one stage, but can&#x27;t find the reference). Even then the SalesForce data model is so denormalised you could call it one big table[1].<p>I use MongoDB day-to-day and it&#x27;s fit for purpose for what I do.

Most people who know Python script in python and so on, and may ignore linux commands and pipelining in favor of their preferred language&#x27;s built in&#x27;s.<p>The Zend thing is a little weird, but most people going into entry level jobs expect to learn the specific framework on the job.  Hell sometimes the specific language.  I don&#x27;t know if I would list Zend on my resume if I had only that guy&#x27;s experience, but a course in OO PHP is pretty specific for a college course. Unless Zend is driving PHP usage like Rails did for Ruby, The guy expected to be able to demonstrate the capacity to learn it and understanding of the underpinnings (PHP and OO), not actually how to do it.  Apparently that guy got an interview, and more modest people probably didn&#x27;t.<p>I certainly list Perl and will say I can do OO Perl code, but I have never used Moose, just old fashioned blessed hashes.<p>At entry level, you should hire the person, not the skills.

Can they articulate their understandings of relevant concepts clearly?  Can they program something in their preferred language and one or two more to show the ability to generalize?<p>A good entry level candidate can do most (but not necessarily all) of the above.<p>Entry is about talents, not skills, and that&#x27;s what you should be looking for.<p>Maybe my expectations aren&#x27;t par for the course where you are, but remember that the best candidates, the guys who have been programming since they were 8 and write their own lisp compilers, they have jobs lined up before they graduate.<p>You can always contact professors at local schools who teach classes relevant to your job openings, and ask them what gets a good grade, and what is an average grade.<p>Calibrate your expectations.

This is vastly superior to previous modes of production because you eliminate all of the time people spend walking around trying to find the next thing that they need.  Before the introduction of the assembly line, workers normally spent more time walking than assembling.  After the introduction, workers spent more time assembling.<p>That said, the assembly line was not entirely a novel production.  The closest predecessor was in the Chicago meatpacking industry where it took the form of a <i>disassembly</i> line - cows went in one end and standard cuts of meat came out the other.  But using it for assembly of complex machinery was still a significant innovation, and Henry Ford deserves full credit for it.<p>It certainly was not simply applying widely known standardization techniques with interchangeable parts such as was pioneered in the rifle industry and had been predicted by Adam Smith in <i>Wealth of Nations</i> with an example involving pins.",1377673785

I&#x27;d never been a gym rat, but having the time in school to spend 1.5-2 hours preparing for my sports seems ever the luxury today. Since the New Year (and the purchase of a road bike), I&#x27;ve been following a pretty consistent routine of biking to work (ranges between 4 and 6 km depending on the route I take), lifting at the gym for 30-45 minutes, and attending yoga classes at least twice weekly (one weekday evening class and one weekend morning class typically). I also play in a men&#x27;s basketball league one night a week for most of the year. This provides the core of my activity; I can usually be found hiking, surfing, playing pickup soccer or basketball, and pretty much anything else active at various points too (which the core work supports and enhances).<p>My gym sessions consist of 20 minutes of mobility exercises, moving all the joints in all the ranges of motion they should enjoy, followed by a focused &quot;workout&quot;, usually 10-15 minutes long. They are almost exclusively full body movements, sometimes done with low reps and heavy weight (such as double kettlebell clean and jerks, 4 sets of 5), sometimes complexes (such as 4 sets of (3-5 pull ups then 10-15 pushups)), and sometimes Crossfit-style workouts (5 burpees, 10 kettlebell snatch (5 per arm), 15 mountain climbers, and 20 kettlebell swings (10 per arm); repeat until you can&#x27;t).<p>For my training, I have three simple steps (stolen from Dan John):
1. Do Something

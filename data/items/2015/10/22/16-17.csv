It doesn&#x27;t stand.<p>A developer and a computer scientist are two different things.<p>There are awesome developers who are terrible computer scientists.   They can build a great website/small web application in RoR or Django, fast and get the job done.\nThe site will never scale tho.<p>There are awesome computer scientists who can&#x27;t build a great web app but can scale the hell out of it.<p>Most companies want developers, not computer scientist.

I had multiple good job offers a week after &quot;graduating&quot; and have always been performing well, obviously according to what was expected when I finished.\nI was able to do useful stuff in our rails app since the first week, and although I needed a lot of mentorship I still think I was useful.<p>I think what&#x27;s important is to be realistic on expectations you have on bootcamp. You won&#x27;t understand how things work after 3 months, but you will definitely know enough to get a job as a junior, and be able to continue learning.<p>After I landed my first job, I continued to take some online classes to know more CS stuff, learn basic algorithms, etc.\nand now that I&#x27;ve been working for almost 3 years (really hard) I feel like I know better than a new grad getting out of school.\nI didn&#x27;t when I started working obviously, but I think that those past 3 years were way more valuable in every single aspect than if I had spent 3 years in College studying CS.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not trying to say you shouldn&#x27;t go to school or anything, but there is definitely a value in bootcamps, especially for people (like me) who already spent 3-4 years in College but want to make a change. I would have never been able to become an engineer without a bootcamp, because I couldn&#x27;t afford another bachelor&#x27;s (and tbh, didn&#x27;t have the motivation for it anyways).",1445533127

I really like the idea of compile time error checking, but I&#x27;m not sure I would stand for adding the complexity of generics.<p>The change in my workflow is not very difficult. For example, when I&#x27;m using plain old javascript, I use documentation to find out how to use third party libraries and DOM manipulations. Though it works out for all of my needs, I wouldn&#x27;t mind adding types. Adding types on top of that would reduce casting and spelling mistakes, but it&#x27;s not like I can&#x27;t open up the browser and test my code with a step through debugger. I would personally prefer opening the browser and maintaining readability in my code versus having type safety in my code and giving up readability.",1445533026

10433262,comment,10432433,10432739,0,0,geebee,,,"I think you may be underestimating the amount of risk an engineer takes on by working at a particular startup.<p>For instance, consider your statement here:<p>&quot;Employees… are paid hourly or salary, regardless of the profits of the company&quot;<p>I can assure you that this isn&#x27;t necessarily true.  I&#x27;ve seen startups go kaput and fail to make payroll.  Employees may not always be aware of the risks, but they are exposed to them.<p>However, even that doesn&#x27;t really capture the risk an employee takes on, if you look at missed opportunities as a risk.  It varies, of course, as some startups pay better than others, and not all employees have the same ability to easily find jobs.  But consider someone who has the ability to get hired as a senior SE at a place like google or netflix, who instead works at a startup for, say, $150k a year.  That&#x27;s still probably close to $75K in lost income a year, and I really do think I&#x27;m keeping these numbers conservative.  You go for four years, and not including interest on investments (there are enough factors, taxes, and so forth, that I&#x27;ll hand waive here)... and that&#x27;s $300k in lost salary.   Keep in mind, it could be considerably more!  Alternatively, working for one startup means not working for another, so a relatively unknown founder may need to compensate for the lower probability that you will succeed with higher equity levels than someone with a more celebrated track record would need to offer.<p>Lastly, you are underestimating the value of stable employment.  It&#x27;s as hard to understand now as it was in 2000, but I saw plenty of good programmers go without work for quite a while.  Some were left in pretty dire financial situations.  Some people, on H1Bs, left stable jobs that would have led permanent residency in a few more years, for startups that folded, in an environment where getting new sponsorship was difficult - in short, had they stayed with the stable employer, they would have gotten residency.  Now, they had to start all over!  We&#x27;re in a boom right now, but the environment in a serious recession has very severe consequences for people who haven&#x27;t found a place to weather the storm.<p>Also there may simply be an imbalance here.  I know it&#x27;s hard to accept, but it may actually be harder to become an exceptional engineer than a startup founder.  A nontechnical founder may be taking on more risk simply because there aren&#x27;t as many other options.  Again, it all depends on the founder, and the engineer - some founders have exceptional options and amazing track records and tech skills to boot, others are vastly overestimating the value they bring to the table.<p>In short, to answer your last question of &quot;why should someone should get more shares of the company without taking on more risk?&quot;  My answer is twofold.  1) they <i>may</i> be taking on vastly more risk than you have estimated through lost opportunities/salary/lack of job stability, 2) they may be entitled to more shares even at lower risk levels because their skills are very valuable (truth is, they may be more valuable than the founder in some cases).",1445532653

A project usually lasts for 2 months at least and they only pay after 30-45 days after client has accepted the final output. So this basically means the developer must be able to survive at least 3 months without any income.<p>Secondly, they happened to get a project from a website that I loved very much. So after I sent them my estimation (they would add their profits to my estimation and sent that to the client), I told them, if the client felt the price is high, I would be happy to make a discount (I explicitly stated the discount was for the client). Soon, client seemed to be happy with the original number and they signed the agreement. But my discount did not go to the client at all. They kept that for their profit.<p>Thirdly, for a project, they sent me a design and I made an estimation. Then they told me the design was wrong, but they already signed an agreement with the client and they asked me to do the almost totally different project doubling the workload for the wrong estimation, which downed my hourly rate to less than $30. My salary before I quit my regular job, was $100+/hour. And I charge my other clients for at least $75/hour.<p>So I quit.

All you need for decentralized identity is a (collection of) public key(s) that can be referenced and cryptographic enforcement of authenticity+integrity. Although I might be a bit biased, because I&#x27;m working on a project that does this.[1] Such an identity system is simple enough that you can layer any naming mechanism on top of it without appreciable extra cost compared to a unified approach, at the advantage of not restricting yourself to a specific naming architecture. By all accounts, a blockchain is a tremendously inappropriate amount of bloat for the purpose of identity authentication.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say that naming requires consensus though. Naming requires a degree of trust in the entity declaring the name. Consensus is only one way to arrive at that trust. And different organizations will have different requirements for trust: for example your bank is going to have very different requirements to &quot;name&quot; your account than, say, Facebook. Informally I&#x27;ve called this the difference between identity authentication vs identity verification, but I know that&#x27;s not ideal terminology -- does anyone have a better suggestion?<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/Muterra/doc-muse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Muterra/doc-muse</a>",1445532112

If you need a specific size monitor to fit a space and the one monitor Apple has does not fit that space, you are SOL.<p>As other commenters have noted, this benefits Apple more than the average consumer. They can offer one or a couple of options, overprice them, and make a lot of money. Ideally, on such a big purchase (although for mobile devices a lot of the cost is not immediately apparent because you pay comparatively little upfront), someone would seek to reduce their choices by doing research on the various options available and deciding which would work best for them. For the monitor example, first filter by screen size, then filter by resolution, then connectors available, etc. for all the features that are important in that case. The options that are left are the best options available in the judgement of the person making the purchase, and then the decision between a handful of options becomes much easier. They can save money by getting only what they want.<p>Quickly deciding for or against just the one option benefits Apple the most.  You end up trading money for ease of choice. I for one would rather keep my money in exchange for extra research, but it seems today&#x27;s culture has an extreme phobia of stress (which is a whole other dicussion in itself).",1445532068

Yes, it is certain that eventually someone will solve the discrete log problem for any given algebraic structure (either by rendering all crypto that relies on it broken, or (less likely) proving it fundamentally secure), but for now, we know that this is hard (since it has been open for a while), and we&#x27;re also incentivizing people to make mathematical discoveries.<p>I&#x27;d also claim that the &quot;crypto community&quot; (at least the academic side of it) and the &quot;technology community&quot; are not the same, and (at least to me) often feel opposed. Cryptologists write papers filled to the brim with dense and precise mathematical assumptions and reductions; technologists skim the papers, ignore the assumptions, and implement half-assed, unaudited versions of the systems in question and claim them secure (pardon my cynicism).<p>As to what the community thinks about mathematical public key crypto, they hail it as the greatest innovation since sliced bread and the herald of modern cryptography. Prior to modernity, cryptography was very ad-hoc and depended on what the author&#x27;s intuitions; modernity introduced precise definitions of what it meant for a system to be secure and raised the bar. It also relies heavily on the concept of a hardness reduction, i.e. a proof that breaking a cryptogrpahic primitive is at least as hard as solving a yet-unsolved math problem.<p>Specifically about algebraic problems, I have a (low confidence) intuition that they are unavoidable in public-key crypto precisely because of the need for an algebraic structure relating the public and private keys. With this in mind, I&#x27;d rather have algorithms which rely on known hard to solve problems (demonstrated hard by having years of mathematical effort poured into them with minimal result) to those which rely on problems no one has ever bothered to look at.<p>A final question: you are unhappy with public key crypto that relies on algebra; would you be happier if it relied on some other branch of mathematics? Analysis? Topology (okay, so that&#x27;s still algebra)? Complexity theory (a secure cryptosystem that relied only on P!=NP would be a holy grail for several reasons, but I don&#x27;t know of any attempts to find one)? Would you feel safe using a cryptosystem that was secure if and only if the Riemann Hypothesis were true? If the RH were false? The Collatz Conjecture?",1445531855

But public libraries are also important — not only for reasons like Stanford&#x27;s sad policy (and when I visited UPenn one night, they wouldn&#x27;t even let me into the library because I wasn&#x27;t a student there, even though I was accompanied by a student) but also because they exist in places where universities don&#x27;t.<p>My disappointment in the library systems of other countries that I&#x27;ve visited is composed of two parts: first, there are many fewer and poorer public libraries than in the US; second, there are many fewer and poorer universities than in the US, which limits the available university libraries sharply.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if Sweden were better than the US in this regard.  Sweden has an excellent welfare state, a world-class university system, and if I&#x27;m not mistaken, a centuries-long tradition of universal literacy.<p>But much of the developed world does not have this advantage; Germany, Norway, Benelux, Finland, Switzerland, Canada, Iceland, Israel, and possibly Austria share these attributes, but the US and UK do not have a reasonable welfare state, and Ireland, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, France, and Japan do not have the long tradition of universal literacy, although of course their educated elites have been literate for over a millennium, producing a rich literature¹.  Countries outside this group (except possibly Singapore and Taiwan) do not even have a world-class university system.<p>That means that in Brazil, mainland China, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Italy, Turkey, Brunei, Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, Saudi, Oman, Czech, Slovenia, Slovakia, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Malaysia, Poland, Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico, and even Hungary, Russia, and Greece, you won&#x27;t even find the kind of university where you&#x27;re thinking to <i>look</i> for a good library, let alone the kind of university library you&#x27;re thinking of.  Maybe they have good public libraries (I hear Estonia&#x27;s public library system is particularly good) but generally I expect not.

You might have a deep, layered theory, but every two pages I should be getting some jolt to my brain.  Some pull it off, others do not.<p>Am I showing a lack of patience and respect?

If your target is anything other than a Mac or a phone, multiply it even further.<p>It&#x27;s a major driver of Internet centralization: things must be centralized to escape the deployment nightmare. It&#x27;s exponentially easier to manage deployment on a handful of servers than it is to actually ship an app to users.<p>With our app, we test our Windows build on Windows Vista, 2008 Server, 7, 2012 Server, 8, 8.1, and 10, on both x86 and x86_64. It always passes before we ship. Then inevitably we get bug reports: the UI won&#x27;t open, device drivers won&#x27;t install, the app mysteriously crashes, etc. Investigation always reveals some weird little variation or clashing piece of software on the customer&#x27;s machine. Every Windows machine is a special snowflake, and as Windows machines run they accumulate &#x27;OS rot&#x27; and gradually become less reliable (due to the mutability of the OS and dependencies). To fully test deployment you&#x27;d have to test hundreds of thousands of VMs with different software install histories, etc. In the end we have to tell people &#x27;sorry, we tested with clean Windows installs on eight different versions, you&#x27;re on your own.&#x27;<p>Mac is the only tolerable deployment target and that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a fascist dictatorship compared to Windows: uniform hardware, strict restrictions on OS modification, and enforced software conformity. Phones aren&#x27;t too bad either but that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re also fascist dictatorships with locked-down OSes.<p>Basically the modern OS is broken. Things are mutable that shouldn&#x27;t be, process isolation is a joke, etc. Server OSes are broken too but at least if you own all the servers you can make sure they&#x27;re all broken in the same way. Even there the trend is toward statically linked binaries (Go) and packaging apps as entire containers with their own OS (Docker) to basically deprecate the OS and achieve predictable deployment.",1445529976

I don't really understand why they set up a separate commission in the first place instead of bringing in that type of oversight under the SEC.<p>Anyone have any insights?",1260345586
985516,comment,985479,985479,0,0,snprbob86,,,"Interesting... It seems like there are real needs for conventions/standards and tooling in several areas.<p>First, Windows desperately needs a proper package manager. There are several projects in the space, but none as successful or prominent as apt, yum, etc.<p>Second, README files seem woefully insufficient for documenting where to send contributions. Doesn't the Linux kernel (and Google internally) have the concept of OWNERS files? If I recall correctly, Google's tools understand these files for the sake of code reviews and bug filing. There is probably also some space for an extended diff/patch format with code review comments. Or a standard format for documenting a version graph.<p>Just spewing ideas...",1260345560

985511,comment,984930,985489,0,0,araneae,,,"Younger males do risky things because that's when they're looking for mates. Death rates start to spike for males in their teens and then decline in their mid twenties, whereas the lines for females smoothly increase as they age.<p>That aside, if you do a regression on the incidence of murder rates, both age and marriage status are significant.  So yes, age explains some of it.  So does marriage status, independently.<p>Regardless of the <i>reason</i> that marriage keeps you out of violent situations, the point still stands that being <i>unmarried</i> is a risk factor for violence.",1260344719

Clicking on your website instantly reminded me of this note in a PG essay:<p>---<p>Viaweb wasn't the first startup Robert Morris and I started. In January 1995, we and a couple friends started a company called Artix. The plan was to put art galleries on the Web. In retrospect, I wonder how we could have wasted our time on anything so stupid. Galleries are not especially excited about being on the Web even now, ten years later. They don't want to have their stock visible to any random visitor, like an antique store.

985507,comment,985439,985439,0,0,Kliment,,,"I like this much better than the post it's a sequel to. It is clear, to the point, readable in one minute. One point I would add is ""Don't make your audience wait."" People who commit the crime of bullet points often aggravate it by making them appear (or slide in with a whoosh effect) one at a time, forcing the audience to process the information much slower than they could. It's very frustrating for the audience. The screen blanking tip is useful (and underdocumented). The best slideshows I've seen had the screen blank most of the time, and were used to show photos and diagrams as necessary, containing no text.",1260344152

985498,comment,985435,985435,0,0,Kliment,,,"It's amusing. Back when Wolfram's ""A New Kind of Science"" (NKS) came out, I was one of the masochistic types that actually read the whole thing. It's a fairly decent introductory text to cellular automata, but it's not new, and wasn't back then either. Well, the amusing bit is that he explicitly states in there how while the visual system has meaningful potential for interpreting complex patterns such as those generated by cellular automata, the auditory system is too linear and limited to perceive such things. And not too long later, he publishes a cellular automata -based music generator on his website (this thing has been around for a while).",1260343014

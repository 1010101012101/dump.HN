Not only is it harder to start businesses in most other countries, but expats face additional restrictions on business activity in most places. So if you want to start a business, stay in the USA. If you still want a change, the USA is a very diverse country, you can find all sorts of cultures just by moving a couple of states in any direction.<p>Challenges can also be found by giving yourself some handicaps.I knew a guy who was a moderately successful programmer, who sold all his belongings and hitchhiked across the USA.<p>If you want some sort of adventure that will test your sense of yourself, try someplace very different. India, Africa, China. Best handled with a buddy traveler, but they are not so hard to find.<p>Extreme short term, you can try Burning Man, that's on in a month and it will definitely stretch your imagination.",1217312283

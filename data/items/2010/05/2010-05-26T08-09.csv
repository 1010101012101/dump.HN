It's hard to find a place where a byte array needs to be memset.<p>If you need an array zeroed on first use, why didn't you use calloc?  The only reason memset has for existing is when you need to reinitialize an existing array to zero.  If things are so tight that you're wiping out an existing array and reusing it, which usually involves being deliberately less abstract than you'd naturally be, then, well, that's a pretty unusual situation.<p>(While we're on memset, I'd like to point out that the weirdest thing is that while memset initializes value byte by byte, the places where you do need a prefilled array are always places where the array is an array of larger values.)",1274861931

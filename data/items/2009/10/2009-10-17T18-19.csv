My wife and I are pretty clear we will return to India in the next couple of years, and have started planning for the transition. In our case the decision is really an emotional one - we identify with India, and see no reason to change that. The latter clause would not have been true for many in the past since there was a much greater disparity in the opportunities present in the two countries then.<p>Having said that, the energy in India is quite palpable. There is a sense of possibility that is very compelling, despite all the barriers that still exist.

887248,comment,887029,887192,0,0,strlen,,,"Designing and implementing a compiler involves <i>many</i> aspects of computer science -- as does distributed systems development.<p>If you've never written a compiler from scratch, I highly suggest doing so(1): there are data structures (symbol table -- a hash table, parse tree, tries), algorithms (converting an NDFSM to a DFSM(2), parsing, filling registers and many others), computer organization / architecture (outputting assembly, optimizing the code with pipelining and CPU cache in mind). Not to mention it's also a substantial project which teaches you a lot about software engineering: it's not something you can write in a single session, it's something that has to be frequently extended and tested (I can't think of a cleaner candidate for test driven development: you specify the source code you want to input and test if the generated IR/assembly code is what you're looking for). It's also really fun :-)<p>Not to mention custom compilers/languages are very useful in distributed systems: look at Thrift/Protocol Buffers ( languages for describing serialization of data structures for RPC). Google also has custom language which is compiled into state machines that they used to implement their Chubby service (and probably other distributed systems) -- see the ""Paxos Live"" paper. At an employer I've been at, which (when I was there) was deploying distributed systems with tens of thousands of nodes, we've created a custom language for describing/querying groups of machines: this language and systems built  on top of it (for monitoring, configuration,  provisioning and deployment), helped reduce admin:machine ratio by orders of magnitude (think a team of three handling ~10,000 machines).<p>(1) I suggest picking up an <i>older</i> (not the newest) version of the Dragon Book and targeting a x86/amd64/MIPS: while for a practical compiler I'd almost <i>certainly</i> suggest targeting LLVM or JVM/CLR, you'll learn more targeting bare metal.<p>(2) Incidentally, Lamport's landmark paper suggested treating processes in distributed systems as state machines.",1255804984

(1..($max-1)) generates a list of integers from 1 to $max - 1. pick($slots-1, :repl) randomly picks $slots - 1 from the first list, replacing the one picked each time (so duplicates are possible). sort does just what you would think.<p>The second line of the sub uses a hyper-operator to subtract one array from another -- in this case the sorted array of random numbers plus $max on the left, 0 plus the array on the right.

It appears to be the results of a bunch of bad decisions unfortunately reaching their boiling point all at once.<p>It's important in times like these to take stock of all of the decisions leading up to this crisis. It sounds like you made a lot of mistakes, as we all do. Learn from them and you'll be the better for it, and in time you'll view this as all as one big opportunity.<p>You didn't lose your job, you quit, so that may or may not have been a mistake (in fact, it may have been a mistake not to do it sooner) but either way it certainly wasn't bad luck. What it will turn out to be depends on what you make of the opportunity. Get another job you hate and it was a mistake, find one you enjoy and it will turn out to be one of the best things you ever did. You have the choice there.<p>Cars almost never die completely with no prior warning. I certainly don't know the situation well enough to be sure, but I'd be willing to bet you ignored some serious signs. That's a mistake I've certainly made and learned from.<p>Losing a phone is usually due to carelessness. We've all done something like it. That one's essentially valueless as a life lesson, you already knew it was bad, and there's only so much you as a human can do to prevent such things from recurring. <p>The relationships are the tough ones. It sounds like in the case of the girl you trusted someone's words rather than their actions because it was the path of least resistance. That's always a mistake. Yet another we've all made. <p>Just like a car, relationships never die without plenty of warning. There's a good chance you saw the signs and willfully ignored them. Learn from that.<p>The only thing left to do now is learn from each mistake and turn all of these annoyances into opportunities.",1188272472

47301,comment,47235,47235,0,0,Goladus,,,"What sort of music are you interested in?  Are you talking about sound production, performing, composing?<p>The main difference with composing is that you are usually writing a program for a real person to perform, not for a computer to execute.   This means that writing music is less exacting, but can also be more subtle.  <p>The other big difference is that you aren't usually writing music to solve an external problem.  With music, you have to invent the problems you want to solve.  You might say ""I want to hold an F# in the alto line for 4 measures, while moving all the other voices in a chord progression that adheres to the following restrictions...""  You just make up the conditions on your own.  Software, in contrast, almost always solves a concrete, defineable problem (even if you don't know what that problem will be when you start coding).<p>With performing, the biggest difference is that it's real-time action and communication.  You have to train physically in order to be good, and learning bad habits is disastrous.  Code-reading and being good at using an editor are more analogous to music performance than software development in general.  With writing code, it can be a good thing to write 1,000 lines of crap, if you learn enough not to make those mistakes again.  Making mistakes while performing just leads to more mistakes in the future.  ",1188272073

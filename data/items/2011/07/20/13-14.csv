Automation aims to reduce the amount of work while businesses have the goal of making as much money as possible and, by extension, since money can only be acquired by working, essentially attempt to automate as little as possible. Personally, I think that this is an old and outdated way of living. It's the same thing that simple biological organisms do - go towards pleasure and away from pain. It explains why, for example, so many software houses only look at the short term and don't take time to design decent systems which are adaptable to change, even though they know that requirements are always shifting. I call this approach 'dumb-lazy', whereas the automation approach is 'smart-lazy'.",1311169791

A traditional and quite common aspiration is to move more into the upper class: to make enough money to regularly travel the world, buy a large house, buy a sports car, or perhaps even move into the higher tier of owning a beach home in Hawaii, yacht, private jet, etc.<p>""Post-materialists"", on the other hand, tend to be satisfied with the Western-middle-class level of prosperity, and once they reach it start aspiring to things like greater autonomy, fewer working hours, greater proportion of time spent on creative endeavors, etc. I don't really like the phrase ""post-materialist"" (feels judgmental), and sort of prefer Tyler Cowen's phrase ""threshold earners"" (which this article also cites), as a more neutral description of people whose monetary aspirations are to reach a comfortable threshhold and stop there.<p>The article is a bit rambling, but what I take as the takeaway is that accounting for those kinds of aspirations requires something more than just ""economic grwoth"", since it's not really a linear scale of move up in the economy --> move up further in the economy.

Several of you go in touch with us, and we're just now finishing our first project: a web app that helps you plan optimal routes and ordering for your events - whEnroute.<p>The client side is a thin smattering of HTML and jQuery. The server side, though... the server side is pure Haskell. We're using the Snap web framework, Heist templating and a couple of open source libraries to talk to Google and SMTP. Some of the changes we had to implement on open source libraries were already merged upstream.<p>At the heart of this app is an algorithm that solves the time-constrained traveling salesman problem. The solution is two-fold: for smaller data sets, we run exhaustive searches. For larger data sets we do simulated annealing to deliver an acceptable solution.<p>The whole thing is still being tweaked, options being added, the user interface is a mess, but hey... it works somewhat, and somebody might actually like it. Launch early, eh?<p>Thanks for helping us find challenging work HN!<p>Sincerely,\nIvan & David<p>Edit: if anyone has any questions, I'm here, and my e-mail is in my profile!",1311167263

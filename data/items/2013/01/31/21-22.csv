I'm a nice guy, usually laid back, and capable of rapid context switching.<p>I have discovered, however, that since I do not work for an emergency room, my context-switching-skills are rather undervalued by the free market. The value I generate for clients and employers is very much correlated to my ability to train clients & colleagues to let me focus on solving one problem completely before moving on to the next problem.<p>I find when you describe the effect of interruptions in terms employers understand  ""working this way costs you money, both directly, because I charge a not-insignificant amount per hour, and indirectly, because there are opportunity costs to my working on emergencies instead of farther-reaching goals""  they will become your allies in fighting off interruptions. If you just complain that interruptions are distracting and irritating, well, you're just gonna get a prima-donna label for yourself.<p>I love working as a team. My creatives can make something look more visually appealing in a few hours that I could in a few months. I can develop the functionality in a few days when they wouldn't know where to start. We all have our strengths.  But creative work is inherently a selfish, individual act requiring concentration, and interruptions, in most instances, don't help the team meet their goals.",1359669558

The fact that psych calls []=(key, val) on instantiated objects in combination with ActionController::Routing::RouteSet::NamedRouteCollection calling eval on the key made for a particularly easy drive-by attack on a <i>huge</i> range of deployments, but even without the []=, there are still plenty of ways to exploit loading arbitrary YAML, though they may require more custom targeting.<p>In terms of that issue request, I doubt that adding a safe_load option would have stopped the Rails vulnerability. After all, the Rails guys _already knew_ that they should not be loading YAML from the request body; that's why it was not allowed directly. The issue was loading XML, which then allowed YAML to be loaded. Allowing YAML to be loaded there was a mistake; it seems unlikely that someone would make that mistake, while at the same time mitigating it by adding safe_load.",1359669533

All the other major contenders (Python, Ruby, Java, etc) are, for better or worse, general-purpose programming languages, which are pressed into service for rendering HTML strings using various libraries and frameworks.<p>For non-trivial web applications, the ""rendering HTML strings"" is one of the smallest parts of the job.<p>The lack of separation between application and HTML output in PHP may be an asset when starting out or when making lightly scripted web pages, but when creating an application that just happens to be served up over the Web (and possibly served up other ways too), those general-purpose languages are much more natural fits for the job.",1359669347

Does every severe security issue that remains unnoticed by a community for some time and is eventually noticed suggest pervasive engineering incompetence throughout that entire community?

Doing something like that would be unthinkable today. Also, AMD became a licensee of Intel's architecture after IBM told Intel that they require at least 2 sources for the chips, an agreement that Intel tried to cancel for 80360.<p>Back in those days these licensing agreements were more about copyright and trade-secrets rather than patents. And AMD had to license X86 from Intel because reverse-engineering was too time-consuming, not because they felt threatened. The patents arms race started around year 2000, when the bubble happened.<p>And it's not like Intel and AMD don't have a long history of litigation. They do.<p>Basically AMD had enough time to get big and innovate or buy valuable technology on its own. After AMD Athlon was released, the big and mighty Intel was in real jeopardy of being driven out of the market, as Athlons were not only cheaper, but better in every way (compared to its predecessor, the AMD K6, which was good and with extra goodies like 3D Now, but lacked a good coprocessor).  Having to license AMD64 was probably a big embarrassment for Intel too, considering Intel was the one that tried to introduce a new architecture that was not backwards compatible with X86 and failed ... though it's interesting to think about the reasons why Intel tried a new and backwards incompatible processor and personally I think existing licensees of X86 had something to do with it.<p>Of course, today AMD seems to have lost their touch. For instance I'm typing this on a Thinkpad with an Ivy Bridge processor, that I bought because of Intel HD, the only graphics card with which you have absolutely no problem under Linux, as Intel's drivers are open-source. I was expecting AMD to do things like this after they bought ATI, but unfortunately they didn't. Such a shame.",1359668155

All funds raised from these clubs would then go towards charity work in a third world country.

All micro-startups that donate over the minimum would compete for a spot on our leaderboard.

(internet open source has changed the way software is written, drastically) And ruby community is especially 'advanced' at code sharing, using each other's code as dependencies in a complex multi-generation dependency graph. That greatly increases the danger of unexpected interactions of features creating security exploits that would not have been predicted by looking at any part in isolation.  But we couldn't accomplish what we have all accomplished without using other people's open source code as more-or-less black box building blocks for our own, we can't do a full security audit of all of our dependencies (and our dependencies' dependencies etc).",1359667561

In an OO language, you are always de-serializing into objects, and objects are always 'executable code'. Hashes and Arrays are executable code too, right?<p>The problem is actually when you allow de-serializing into _arbitrary_ objects of arbitrary classes, and some of those objects have dangerous side effects _just by being instantiated_, and/or have functionality that can turn into arbitrary code execution vector.  (Hopefully Hash's and Array's don't).<p>It is a problem, and it's probably fair to say that you should never have a de-serialization format that takes untrusted input and de-serializes to anyting but a small whitelisted set of classes/types.

And as an ex-amazonian sometimes I go and check for bugs that were issues back in the day- several of them have come back over the years, which is not surprising given that the entire group that was working on the parts I was working on disbanded because so many people were driven off by bad management.  (A one-two punch in that case, a bad manager backed by another bad manager, neither of which had any technical knowledge.)<p>At the time I worked there, large swaths of code in the store had no team who was responsible because the team had been disbanded in one of the regular shuffles of employees.  Amazon had a tendency to get a team together to do a feature, launch it, get the PR and the stock bump, then disband the team and put them on other projects.  Of course some of these things stuck around if they were successful, but there was a lot of cruft from past efforts like: Local restaurant menus, the movie times system, various ""social shopping features"" (a perennial favorite to try again and again.)

I knew him in the Infogami days, pre-Reddit, and I ceased our friendship because of his negativity. He wasn't mean, but my main impression of him was ""Smartbut negative."" Cory Doctorow wrote about the harsh experience of Aaron's mentors, who were on the receiving end of his disappointment.<p>Yes, the whole prosecutorial situation was adverse. Yes, it was ridiculous. Yes, he could have accepted a 6 month plea bargain he did things which are if not outright illegal, clearly were not really aboveboard, either.<p>Yes, I believe that a lot of what people call 'depression' has to do with circumstances[1] -- and you'd have to have been a lot closer to Aaron than me to know if there were circumstances making him miserable back then, or if it was an organic issue, or simply who he was, <i>personality</i>-wise.<p>Many people in worse situations don't kill themselves. Many people in lesser situations do.<p>None of that matters. The fact that Aaron took his own life is tragic. I was truly sorry to hear it, but I wasn't very surprised.<p>It's simply a fact that things are more complex than they appear from the outside. People are more complex than they appear from the outside. And when you spend a lot of time with someone, sometimes you say ""Oh, they're depressed,"" when really they have a lot of shitty people in their lives; and sometimes it's because they make choices that make their lives miserable; and sometimes it's because they have a real organic issue that has nothing to do with their daily lives or friends/family/job or personal choices.<p>You can't know, though, from the outside. Only they can know.<p>That's the fact of the matter.<p>None of this downplays the need for empathy. I think it increases it. But there's no point in saying ""depression is chemical"" or ""depression is because of shitty circumstances"" or ""depression is a fault of choices."" Unless it's you -- and probably even if it IS you -- you can't ever know which it is.<p>[1] NOT saying this is to do with Aaron, but just based on my experience of a lot of different people and reading a lot of research -- ""circumstances"" can include all the obvious external things we think of as circumstances, and also personal, inner circumstance, such as viewing one's self as someone who has to become a world savior or the next Bill Gates, presenting a false face to everyone (result? feeling completely isolated and unknown), the choice to embrace a victim mindset, self-pity, and sometimes ""too high standards"" which is masking a lack of empathy for fellow people as individuals.",1359666337

What specific, verifiable corrective action are we taking in order to prevent this kind and other kinds of breaches going forward?<p>Just saying &quot;We take security seriously&quot; is like saying (to quote Chris Rock) &quot;I take CARE of my kids!&quot; What do you want, a cookie?

That would be fine if the expectation of Alexis was that he would simply be the Executive Chair of the Board of Directors.  But that&#x27;s not what was expected.  Those of us who were around reddit when kn0thing and spez ran the place and it was held together with duct tape and good intentions remember someone who was an active member of the community and who truly had the community&#x27;s interests at heart.  We thought when he returned that we were getting that Alexis back, and we were happy.<p>But that Alexis appears to have &quot;matured&quot; into a vanilla businessman, and that&#x27;s fine.  What isn&#x27;t fine is the mass exodus of admins who were actually redditors, the bringing in of a CEO whose goals clearly align more with monetizing than nurturing, and a series of decisions that have shown the remaining braintrust at reddit to have grown further and further away from the community.<p>It&#x27;s fine to monetize reddit.  It&#x27;s fine to run it like a real, live company.  What&#x27;s not fine is to do that to the exclusion of all else, and risk jeopardizing the very community that gives the site value in the first place.<p>What we&#x27;ve seen from the actions of the executive team at reddit in recent months suggests that they simply don&#x27;t understand how their actions are being perceived.  They&#x27;ve either lost or pushed out the people at the company who had a finger on the pulse of the community, and now they&#x27;re flying blind.  It seems that the only thing keeping reddit going right now as a community is the lack of a viable alternative, and that&#x27;s a very dangerous place to be for a company like reddit.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether the executive team at reddit sees this episode as just another fire to put out or as a portent of things to come.  What <i>I</i> see, as an active participant on the site, is a restive user base that increasingly sees itself as neglected and taken for granted by a dismissive and aloof leadership.  There are many things keeping the user base in reddit&#x27;s orbit, but most of those things come down to inertia and lack of a better alternative.  If the latter is solved, the former will take care of itself, and reddit will hit a tipping point whereby its most engaged users leave en masse.<p>It&#x27;s not there yet, but it&#x27;s an existential threat that it doesn&#x27;t appear the reddit brain trust is taking seriously.",1436142184

The sample size is not actually &quot;minimal&quot;, and it&#x27;s this is a common criticism where the critic, surprise surprise, never says what a non-minimal sample size is. &quot;NCHS also typically requires at least 30 observations&quot;: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error</a>.<p>Here are some key concepts to keep in mind.<p>The central limit theorem states: regardless of the shape of the parent population, the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution as N increases. This means we can generalize what the size of n means to many many things, generally including all sorts of traits in people, and including flipping a coin. So for an intuition, flip a coin 30 times, and 95% of the time, you will be within 5.5 of the mean (15) and it follows the standard bell curve, 99% I will be within 8.22 of the mean, etc. So, if say &quot;there is a greater than 20% chance a coin flips will end up with heads&quot; and you say, &quot;from a statistics point of view, your sample size is too small&quot;, I can say, &quot;not true at all&quot;, with consideration to my sample size, I&#x27;m 99.9999...% likely to be right. And just glimpsing, I&#x27;m confident the study did their math right.<p>There are other very important things to be critical of, and it is certainly reasonable to be skeptical of the study. Much more likely to cause a false result: getting unbiased, representative sample, publishing bias, causation vs correlation, etc, etc.<p>And when you think about sample size, the accuracy with respect to the population follows 1/sqrt(n). So n=200 is twice as accurate as n=50.",1436141320

This is why unsecured debt attracts a higher interest rate than secured debt and is why all debt incurs a higher interest rate than inflation.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why popular opinion towards debt seems to invert at some point.

First, it&#x27;s in an area that contains basically nothing. Maybe they draw energy off of matter present near them or are highly efficient. Another possibility is that it&#x27;s an outpost used for communication, maybe to hide their homeworld. I have a friend who wrote a whole treatise on how hiding one&#x27;s location would be essential to interstellar warfare or survival given how nukes, weaponized asteroids, etc can lay waste to whole planets worth of life. Mass Effect&#x27;s Reapers also used &quot;dark space&quot; for concealment between attacks.<p>The other thing is non-repetition. If it was purposeful, it should&#x27;ve been repeated to ensure we&#x27;d catch it. Maybe it was done as a one-off burst (eg like EMP w/ structure) that would go all over the place.

I don't think your argument sticks.<p>It feels like regulations do well with medications that science understands. It does not understand modafinil well. What evidence do you have of ""the odds"" that it causes no permanent harm?",1205156865
133117,comment,132899,132899,0,0,tptacek,,,"How can demand-threading <i>possibly</i> be faster or more memory-efficient than event processing? Web apps are, to a one, I/O bound. Event programming schedules those applications on I/O.<p>The hand-waving on threading bugs is funny, too. ""They're both hard, they both have learning curves!"". Nobody has ever  livelocked competing events. It's awfully hard to serialize an entire event-based program on a single shared variable. This post gives me the impression of an author who has never scaled real threaded code.",1205156662

That's why many many researchers cheat, and it's so scandalous when they are caught.<p>Think about this:  you lose out on a job opportunity to someone who forged their data or perhaps used stimulants to work at an unnatural pace over a certain period of time.  This changes your career in a dramatic way.  When that person is caught, what is your compensation?  Yes, he (she) was exposed but you were wronged.  What would be fair compensation?",1205156622

133111,comment,132901,132901,0,0,obdurak,,,"I see that Git has indeed advanced, sexier concepts than Hg.  However there is one thing that makes me uncomfortable with Git:  Its source code is a bit like the Linux kernel: written in C, messy, with lots of scripts (including Bash and Perl scripts).  Mercurial's is written in Python.  As an Ocaml hacker, I do not like Python much; however I think a tool such a VCS ought to be written in a higher-level language than C, even if that means Python.  How are we going to be sure that the Git code doesn't contain nasty buffer overflows?  If Python does not give static type safety, at least it shields against segmentation faults.",1205156063

A huge number of potential athletes take steroids in high school, before testing begins.<p>I personally think that we should take care to ban these drugs and practices to people who are still developing mentally and physically, but adults should be allowed to make their own decisions.

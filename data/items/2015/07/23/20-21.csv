Every negative outcome that regulation is meant to mitigate (accountability, safety, reliability, discrimination, non-predatory pricing) is better served by Uber (and two-factor location tracking) than traditional cabs. I have not heard anybody raise compelling objections to Uber&#x27;s model based on objective harm to consumers or market non-participants (negative externalities).<p>You are aware Uber skimps on background checks that result in real harm to real people [among other problems] right? They also actively fight taxi-equivalent background check requirements?<p>I think the problem is people really do not understand why the vast majority of these regulations exist in the first place. The vast majority are not instances of &quot;regulatory capture&quot; but basic safety like &quot;Hey, don&#x27;t hire ex-cons in a line of work where they can trap you in a car&quot; and those are what Uber focuses on repealing/fighting.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/technology/ubers-system-for-screening-drivers-comes-under-scrutiny.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/technology/ubers-system-fo...</a><p>> And in California, Uber and other companies like it helped kill a law that would have required drivers to undergo a background check by the state’s Justice Department, as is required of taxi drivers.<p>> Uber champions its “industry-leading standards” for vetting its drivers. On its website, it describes its background checks as “often more rigorous” than those in the traditional taxi industry.<p>> But in statehouses across the country, Uber has fought against legislation requiring background checks as strong as those demanded of traditional taxis. Other ride-sharing companies like Lyft and Sidecar, Uber’s chief rivals, have also pushed against the laws, but supporters of stronger background checks say Uber has been by far the most aggressive.<p><a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/ubers-background-checks-dont-catch-criminals-says-houston/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnet.com/news/ubers-background-checks-dont-catch-...</a><p>> The driver, Duncan Eric Burton, 57, is an ex-con. He&#x27;d spent 14 years in federal prison on drug charges and was released in 2012, according to the Houston Chronicle. And he had cleared Uber&#x27;s background check.<p>> How does that happen? The city of Houston believes Uber&#x27;s background checks aren&#x27;t thorough enough. That&#x27;s why Houston is among the few cities to require every Uber driver to be licensed by the city and undergo FBI fingerprint checks. But while the city requires it, Uber doesn&#x27;t -- allowing people to still drive for the ride-hailing service as long as the authorities don&#x27;t catch them.<p>> Case in point: one applicant who cleared Uber&#x27;s background checks had 24 alias names, five listed birth dates, 10 listed Social Security numbers and an active warrant for arrest, according to a report released last week by Houston&#x27;s Administration and Regulatory Affairs Department.<p><a href=""https://pando.com/2014/01/06/exclusive-uber-driver-accused-of-assault-passed-zero-tolerance-background-check-despite-criminal-history/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pando.com/2014/01/06/exclusive-uber-driver-accused-o...</a><p>> However, Pando has since learned that the driver -- 28-year-old San Francisco resident Daveea Whitmire -- has a criminal record, including felony and misdemeanor charges, and at least one felony conviction involving prison time.

AND, will need to accept that that data may result in forms of accountability. Just like user data informs accountability measures within their platforms:<p>The problem with this is it imagines a world where the regulators don&#x27;t need to perform any kind of audit/inspection.<p>The reality is, companies cut corners which will cause bugs and &quot;bugs&quot; in the data transfer process. The only way for a regulator to discover these issues is....to do what they do now.<p>It also ignores the fact that companies like Amazon <i>explicitly tell people who interact with the reporting portion of their MWS business that they cannot report information in real time</i>. And I&#x27;m pretty sure that is due to costs. This regulatory model would likely increase compliance costs for businesses with delayed reporting mechanisms because they don&#x27;t need to guarantee processing in real time. The same is true of numerous companies I deal with at #DayJob. There are numerous remote sites with low bandwidth connections including <i>in other countries</i> that regularly have replication delays for reporting purposes.<p>There are soooooo many holes that are going to require the &quot;expensive&quot; part of regulation (boots on the ground to inspect/examine) to continue to operate the &quot;old&quot; way anyway.",1437684445

Assuming we want to support a few concurrent searches against the same genome, we&#x27;d need a few GPUs per genome, and this gets expensive pretty quickly on AWS.<p>- Our fleet is now non-homogeneous, and now if machine X fails we need to restore machine X&#x27; with the same set of genomes.<p>- If certain genomes are more popular than others, we&#x27;ll likely have GPUs spun up that aren&#x27;t being used much (only one lab might be investigating a certain genome, for example). I suppose you could swap genomes in and out of memory as they&#x27;re accessed, but again it&#x27;s more complex to manage resources.<p>- Our current approach allows us to add genomes ad-hoc - hypothetically, you could point us to your own genome on S3 and we&#x27;d be able to work with it.<p>We hint at it towards the end, but we&#x27;re actually switching to AWS Lambda soon - based on early calculations, it could cost us as little as $50 a month to run everything!",1437684445

Our entire sales model is predicated on people being able to start easily, and grow if they need to. Price, self service-ness, and the content we produce are all important in this model.<p>The thing about lone wolf developers, and side projects, and one off things people hack together over the weekend is that they sometimes &quot;flip&quot; and become big customers. That&#x27;s when we win, and we monitor our funnel like crazy and continuously see that it&#x27;s working. Interestingly, some of the bad customer experiences you see in this thread are the direct result of this model. We aren&#x27;t very good at handling one offs, or doing things by hand, or consulting, because we focus so much on repeatable, self service offerings — which have to work for small applications.<p>IBM is interested in three things from us. The technology is good, the team is great, and the way we sell to customers is something they have told us they firmly believe is the future of selling tools to developers. There&#x27;s a really, really good chance that you&#x27;ll see other parts of IBM acting like us (and building things for you) before you see us becoming all enterprisey.<p>We&#x27;ll keep the name Compose (because it&#x27;s fabulous!), we&#x27;ll keep the cheap Postgres option, and we&#x27;ll do our best to keep that true for years and years.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I greatly appreciate your comment.",1437683965

There&#x27;s several approaches that come to mind: straight up free software; software and hardware at cost; one of these for a certain period to allow growth before charging for it.<p>The free software obviously isn&#x27;t making the company money. However, most internal projects on a budget or startups in this era aren&#x27;t going to choose IBM&#x27;s tools. They&#x27;re too expensive and not that popular. So, by not giving it away, they probably gain nothing in licensing. By giving it away, they gain nothing in licensing but might in the project&#x27;s goal due to software&#x27;s advantages.<p>For at cost, it might be sustainable. They continue to make most of their profit outside IBM. Inside IBM, they offer their products anywhere ranging from free to a considerable discount. The offer covers the cost of the product in terms of delivery, support, hardware, and so on. That money fuels development and/or cost-cutting on the offerings in general. Volume of IBM use alone might add several developers to any product. So, in this model, there&#x27;s no losses past what they currently charge, the products get funds for development, and there are gains throughout organization via their benefits.<p>The final model is basically a trial period. The projects or acquired startups get to use their choice of products with discounts ranging from cheaper to at cost to free depending on budget. As budget or success grow, the discount gets lower. Over time, you have a division that&#x27;s paying full price for the products or begins transitioning to others. You get the benefits of option 2 with some of what general market might pay.<p>Personally, I think Model 1 wouldn&#x27;t hurt them except whatever they&#x27;re charging for internal use. Model 2 seems to be the best with Model 3 having a chance of success. The reason I promote this is that IBM is sitting on a lot more potential than they&#x27;re using, mostly due to culture. However, I think they could create significant, competitive advantages if all their projects and divisions could inexpensively use every key capability they&#x27;ve produced.

That&#x27;s it.&quot;\n\n\n  Not all starches, as it happens, are created equal. \n  Some, known as digestible starches, take only a little \n  time to digest, are quickly turned into glucose, and \n  then later glycogen. Excess glycogen ends up adding to \n  the size of our guts if we don&#x27;t expend enough energy to \n  burn it off. Other starches, meanwhile, called resistant \n  starches, take a long time for the body to process, \n  aren&#x27;t converted into glucose or glycogen because we  \n  lack the ability to digest them, and add up to fewer \n  calories.\n\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/03/25/scientists-have-figured-out-a-simple-way-to-cook-rice-that-dramatically-cuts-the-calories/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/03/25/s...</a>",1437683023

And then there’s some twelve-year-old girl that’s arrested for being a terrorist because of some set of coincidences that set off an algorithm, which is ridiculous. Something more plausible would be more dangerous, right? I think the danger could increase as the algorithms get better.<p>Mike: Because we start to trust them so much, because they’ve been right so often?<p>John: Right. If an algorithm is right half the time, it’s easy to say well, that was a false positive. If an algorithm is usually right--if it’s right ninety-nine percent of the time--that makes it harder when you’re in the one percent. And the cost of these false positives is not zero.

Walking to Great Yarmouth is listed as .1 mile (I don&#x27;t know how though since I don&#x27;t see any bridges across the water).<p>In addition, that&#x27;s a stop along the train line to Great Yarmouth which isn&#x27;t exactly nowhere.  So, are they running a train <i>only</i> to Berney Arms?  I doubt it terminates there.  Now, it could be that passenger service is sparse because it follows the geographic feature (the river) rather than cutting through like the roads.<p>Finally, a lot of this stuff stems from the massive cuts that the railways took in the 1960&#x27;s.

As our planet detection abilities increase to smaller and smaller planets I believe we&#x27;ll find more and more of those too. Some of these (like this one) will be in the habitable zone of a star. Some of those assumedly will develop life. Some of those will develop sentient life.<p>I just picture a timeline like Earth&#x27;s projected on this planet, which of course has no basis in fact. But imagine a civilization that&#x27;s had <i>2 billion</i> years of life longer than ours?<p>That&#x27;s a really long time obviously. It&#x27;s hard to imagine that such a civilization couldn&#x27;t develop automated methods to populate the local space around them. This is one of the counterarguments to life being common in the universe of course. At 1% of the speed of light you could populate the galaxy with autonomous robots in a &quot;mere&quot; 10 million years.<p>So our inability to detect anything like this gives weight to the argument that no such starfaring civilization exists or that they&#x27;re less than ~10 milllion years old.<p>Was there civilization on this planet and it died out for some reason? We&#x27;ll probably never know.<p>As these planets mount up (as I believe they will), it&#x27;ll further strengthen the idea that we&#x27;re basically doomed (ie the Great Filter) and further suggest we are a mere cosmic blink.",1437681982

In prototype-based programming, you create an object which has shared functionality (the prototype), and then create new objects by cloning that object. That&#x27;s not how you implement shared functionality in JavaScript; in JavaScript, you implement shared functionality by delegating to another object. In other words, JavaScript objects work like Python, or Ruby, or Smalltalk (yes, unlike these languages JavaScript, until ES6, makes no language-level distinction between an object which is also a class, and an object which isn&#x27;t a class, but that&#x27;s just a matter of syntactic sugar).",1437681973

In these corporations there are layers of management, with bosses at the top who earn big salaries. They have access to the flow of money and materials, and use that privilege to their own personal advantage.<p>Workers owning the means of production under communism is an empty concept. The workers don&#x27;t actually hold any deeds that show they own some concrete share of anything, with a concrete monetary figure attached to that share.<p>Proper ownership means that you hold the title to a piece of the pie, and you can cash that out if you want to leave that system. That cannot be under communism, because freely held shares are private ownership. As soon as you have that, some workers will buy out shares from others creating inequality.  Speaking of leaving the system: for many people from the Eastern Bloc between the 1940&#x27;s and 1980&#x27;s, that meant getting over some barbed wire fence, and losing everything they had. (Conforming that they actually owned nothing.)<p>The idea that everyone owns everything under communism is purely <i>symbolic</i>.

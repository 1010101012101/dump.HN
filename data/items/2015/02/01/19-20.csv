As of January 2015, Chariot offers three commuter routes in San Francisco: Chestnut Bullet, SoMa Express, and Cole Valley Cruiser. Our riders often use federally-mandated commuter transit benefits for savings of up to 40% - a feature taxis will never be able to offer.<p>The commute is an enormous pain point for workers around the world; it can either make or break someone&#x27;s day, and we&#x27;re solving it, one neighborhood at a time. The team at Chariot tirelessly works to improve the existing customer experience on our mature routes and pushes to launch new routes as fast as possible.<p>We&#x27;re hiring a lead mobile developer, a backend engineer, and marketing roles at all levels. Stack includes Python, Angular.js, Swift (iOS), and PostgreSQL.<p><a href=""https://angel.co/chariot/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://angel.co/chariot/jobs</a><p>Even if you&#x27;re just curious, reach out to ali@chariotsf.com!",1422820782

8981396,comment,8979886,8981296,0,0,briandear,,,"The U.S. is known as a low tax regime? They have among the highest corporate taxes in the world. Taxation as a percentage of GDP is not a good measure because that doesn&#x27;t address the tax burden as a percentage of income, but as a percentage of GDP. That also doesn&#x27;t measure the value received for the tax burden endured. As an extreme example, if you are receiving value from those taxes (perhaps education or public transport,) then you would pay less out of pocket for those services. However if you had a low tax rate but we&#x27;re required to pay for everything directly (such as paying for education,) then the real value of those taxes to the citizen is much less. So at the end of the day, you may pay lower tax, but you spend more because those taxes aren&#x27;t delivering value. The raw ratio is meaningless; the value derived per dollar is much more meaningful.<p>And yes, the Baltics do have a bad ratio of taxes collected, versus value received.",1422820653

8981385,comment,8979886,8981058,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I had similar thoughts but then I reconsidered.<p>In theory banks price risk using interest rates. That is to say that high risk individuals have to pay a higher interest rate on their debt than lower risk individuals. This reflects the banks concern that they won&#x27;t get paid back.<p>If they (the banks) are doing their jobs right then having their highest risk people default is already covered by the interest rates other less risky clients are paying.<p>The trick though is actually making the bank <i>take the loss</i> which is something they have worked around with the help of the various governments. And that is where we get a conflict of interest where the bank is pricing the loans with the expected risk but actually taking much less risk due to government back stops. That difference is, as you would expect, profit for the bank.",1422820499

Software security is a nonalgorithmic problem, and the best you can do is risk management.<p>Look at it this way: if you spent 300 engineering hours a month investigating spurious reports and the only valid reports you ever received were for cross-site request forgery attacks on non-sensitive profile actions, it does not matter what the ivory tower ideal of the bug bounty was, you wasted resources.<p>&quot;Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow&quot; is like the worst case scenario for an algorithm.

You write out your answers and we manually review it.<p>2. Pair program with one startup.\nAfter we review your work, you get assigned to one of our partner startups. You’ll pair program and answer a couple technical questions via screen share for an hour. The project you&#x27;ll work on is the same one that everyone uses, so it doesn’t matter which startup you get paired with.<p>3. One interview. Shared with many companies.\nWe share your pair programming session and interview with all our partner startups, including the ones you didn’t interview with.

8981257,comment,8980795,8981170,0,0,dsacco,,,"First, while I generally advocate for bug bounty programs, don&#x27;t be fooled by the apparent cost.<p>Well known companies (especially those that pay out a bounty) typically receive tens of thousands of formal security reports a year, all from people hoping for a bounty and a place on the &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; list. It&#x27;s very lucrative and competitive for aspiring security researchers in developing countries to learn information security this way.<p>Unfortunately, the most well known companies also average between 5% and 10% report validity (at the highest), which means that they sink hundreds of engineering hours into investigating spurious reports. In fact, there are security engineers at Yahoo, Google and Facebook who, despite it not being the entirety of their job description, almost exclusively fill their time by investigating reports.<p>To quantify this, if you estimate that about 200 engineering hours are spent on investigating reports each month by the security team (<i>very</i> conservative estimate), about 7% of reports are valid, and the cost of a security engineer&#x27;s time is about $100,000, you quickly see that a bug bounty for the largest companies burns through millions of dollars a year <i>more</i> than the actual bounties paid out. These numbers might actually increase if you take into account the fully loaded cost of each security engineer, or their average salaries are higher.<p>I think it would be great if more companies embraced bug bounties, but to be very honest, the state of most programs&#x27; fiscal management is frankly a mess right now.<p>Second, consider that Apple <i>does</i> have a responsible disclosure program (complete with &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; honorable mention), and that many other &quot;major&quot; tech companies have excellent security without paying out bounties for responsible disclosure. Microsoft had a responsible disclosure program for a long time, and only recently introduced bounties (and the bounties are still for a very limited scope compared to the size of Microsoft&#x27;s properties). Amazon also doesn&#x27;t pay out bounties for responsible disclosure.<p>There is really no reason to not have a responsible disclosure program, but there are coherent arguments against having a bug bounty program.",1422818539

8981251,comment,8978226,8978226,0,0,tzs,,,"> This USB key RNG also demonstrates what I feel should be considered best-practices for TRNGs. It is low cost, reasonably fast, and has no firmware that can be used to PWN your computer. The USB key can easily be taken apart (with care!) using a toothless dinner knife, so the board can be compared to those on the github site.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to compare to another well known USB RNG, the Simtec&#x27;s Entropy Key[1], which apparently is no longer available. The Entropy Key takes the opposite approach both on firmware and on easy of taking it apart.<p>Here&#x27;s an overview of how Entropy Key worked (more detail on the &quot;technical&quot; tab on their site). They have two separate reverse biased PN junctions generating random streams. These streams are each tested using Maurer&#x27;s universal statistical test for random bit generators, and their entropy is conservatively estimated. If the test fails or the entropy is too low, it is a fatal error and the device stops sending random data to the host, and reports an error.<p>The two streams are also xor&#x27;ed together, and that combined stream is tested with Maurer&#x27;s test and its entropy is estimated. If this fails, it is fatal. (Combining the streams this way detects if the two generators have become correlated).<p>The two streams go through von Neumann debiasing, and are tested again with Maurer&#x27;s test, and the entropy is estimated. If the test fails, or the entropy is varying too widely, fatal error.<p>The streams then go into a 256-bit cryptographic hash. When enough bits have gone in so that the input entropy is at least 150% of the number of output bits of the hash, the output is taken.<p>The hash output is mixed into a bit pool. When the pool has taken in at least 50% more entropy than it could possibly hold, a new pool is started. Enough pools are maintained to have 20000 bits of total pool data. The pool blocks are then tested following FIPS 140-2. The 20000 bits are then available for delivery to the host.<p>The protocol for host communication encrypts the data blocks that contain the random bits, using a session key based on a shared secret between the device and the host.<p>The device is filled with epoxy, and opening the case should destroy it.<p>So, are they any security experts who can comment on which is closer to best practice? A minimal device that just delivers fairly raw bits, with all the statistical testing and other processing necessary for good random numbers up to the host, and with no protection against hardware tampering (other than hoping that tampering would mess up the stream in a way the host will notice)? Or a device that does the testing and processing, and delivers ready to use random bits to the host, and that tries to prevent tampering?<p>I would think that even with the simple approach, you should put two theoretically identical generators on the device. That way, if someone does try to influence the device by external means, you have a better chance of detecting it because if it influences both devices the same way you&#x27;ll get correlations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.entropykey.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.entropykey.co.uk</a>",1422818421

8981240,comment,8979886,8981058,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"It appears banks and corporations were part of this decision. They decided to wipe the debt on their own, urged by the government.<p>We&#x27;re talking about poor people who are very likely unable to pay off their debt. Why? It only applies to people whose monthly income is $138, try paying your rent, food etc on that, and then pay off a debt whose interest alone would already be a significant chunk of your monthly income.<p>Interest rates already account for these risks and banks have largely already written off these loans as money that won&#x27;t be paid back. The notion that these were awesome loans that would get paid back and suddenly get cancelled just isn&#x27;t true. Which is why interest rates aren&#x27;t likely to skyrocket and why they don&#x27;t constitute losses, they have already materialized even if the debt isn&#x27;t cancelled.<p>Talks of the poor being burdened by taxes the hardest, come on. First, it&#x27;s just 0.75% of debt. Second, the revenue on this is minimal. If you borrow $100 at a 10% interest rate that&#x27;s $10 of interest revenue (the rest is principal paid back), and that $10 interest revenue is then taxed at say 20% capital gains tax. So if 0.75% of the debt is cancelled, that&#x27;s only 0.015% lost tax revenue from debt, it&#x27;s not going to cause any national tax disasters for the poor. Especially because, again, these loans weren&#x27;t going to get paid off anyway, it doesn&#x27;t change much in extra losses.<p>On the contrary, cancelling 0.75% of the debt makes 20% of the indebted debt-free. They become economic actors again, who previously had no access to their bank account and no room to make personal investments into education or small enterprise. Things you mentioned like sex slavery are more likely to drop because of this than anything else.<p>Lastly, your point on smart/stupid borrowing, we&#x27;re talking about a country which was extremely hard-hit by the crisis, one which the PhDs and CEOs at the top financial institutions didn&#x27;t see coming any better than the world&#x27;s dumbest person. We mustn&#x27;t assume 20% of the indebted people who will become economic actors again were borrowing for gambling, it seems like a lot of these people have been put into economic paralysis due to a crisis just like the large financial institutions, yet the large corporations and banks got bailed out and they weren&#x27;t. And they&#x27;re in no position to pull themselves out of this with a blocked off bank account and less than $138 in monthly income.<p>So what&#x27;s the solution? Ask corporations to do the right and smart thing: write-off 1% of your debts that you had already written off anyway, turn 20% of your debtors into economic actors again who regain buying power, start businesses and participate in the economy, get good will from the public and government and get your country on the road again.<p>I fully appreciate that this isn&#x27;t black and white and there are definite cons, but it seems to me to be a positive decision on aggregate.<p>I think it helps to see it as an investment. Imagine you take 0.75% of your debt, the bottom 0.75% that was extremely likely to ever get paid off, the part that was already part of your cashflow and solvency modelling and whose likely potential losses have already been accounted for.<p>Then take that amount, and go to the board and say, we can invest this amount, buy legal good-will from the government, buy good-will/marketing from our national customer base, and we get access to a new market increasing our long-term customers by a substantial percentage (20% of its debtors). The cost? Just forgo 0.75% of the debt that wasn&#x27;t actually going to make us much money anyway.<p>That&#x27;s why corporations chose this themselves, it&#x27;s not a bad idea for them.<p>Or, keep bank accounts frozen for 20% of the indebted people who got hit by the financial crisis and make $138 a month, bail out financial institutions, and try to run a country where a significant portion of your population are so paralyzed by debts that they turn to sources of income which won&#x27;t be taxed or absorbed immediately by debt-payback, the type of jobs paid in cash, the criminal kind, the exploitative kind, the kind that&#x27;s not taxed, that doesn&#x27;t create jobs or small to medium sized enterprises, the kind that increases costs of policing and regulations, the kind that increases the class divide and pits people against each other. And do exactly to the poorest (leave them to figure it out by themselves) what we weren&#x27;t willing to do to our largest companies (who we bailed out because it made more sense than to let things crash and burn out of a fetish for non-interventionism market principles right after an economic crisis.",1422818344

Develop a consistent system for collecting flavor profiles - while eliminating exogenous factors such as unattributed variables, halo and masking effect, environmental effects, and cognitive effects.<p>2. Collect thousands of reviews. Either from an IID sample of the population (sure...), or include the collection of demographic and personal identifiers within the data.<p>3. Understand the effects of age, race, sex, socio-economic status, and past tasting experiences.<p>4. Build basic flavor models, test that your system isn&#x27;t leaving out important information that causes unseen variance within the product reviews, and continue collecting data.<p>After all of that, the real fun begins! At this point, we can determine most of the chemistry of a product, its risk of flaws taints and contaminations, its production process, and its optimal target demographic just from a few full-sensory reviews.<p>But we don&#x27;t rely on standard sensory science to do it - that&#x27;s stuck trying to figure out how Craft Foods can add less of a cheaper sugar substitute before people notice.<p>[1] www.gastrograph.com",1422818123

8981221,comment,8980225,8980225,0,0,skuhn,,,"I had routinely given Uber drivers ratings between 3-5 stars (good, better, best), because service was always good enough that I didn&#x27;t feel a need to dip lower. Then a driver mentioned that if a passenger gave him less than 5 stars, he would have been better off not taking the fare at all. That was pretty eye opening: that a $30+ fare wasn&#x27;t worth being rated a 4, because of the future lost business that results from having a 4.8 average instead of a 4.9.<p>This was a few years ago, before Uber X launched. So even then, Uber had limited their scale (which provides 50 ratings points) such that only the top 5 ratings were acceptable. I think it has only tightened since then, I rarely see a driver below 4.8 at all.<p>Now I always give drivers a 5 unless something truly unacceptable happens, in which case I file a complaint with Uber. The ratings feedback loop has been completely broken for me.<p>It&#x27;s ridiculous, and I don&#x27;t see how they get the results they want when people have no idea what each rating number is supposed to mean. Some people start at 5 and remove points for issues. Some people start at 3 and only go up if you&#x27;ve gone beyond the call of duty. The only thing that makes sense is an up / down vote, when the scale can&#x27;t be agreed upon by all participants.<p>I suppose that the driver -> passenger ratings might actually work as intended, since the drivers are presumably well aware of the reality of the ratings scale.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is unique to Uber or car services by any stretch either. I have noticed that any service with too many ratings choices seems to suffer from poor ratings quality. Yelp is my go to example here. There <i>should</i> be no shame in a restaurant rated 3 stars, but in actuality it&#x27;s seen as the kiss of death to a lot of places. Here again, some people are rating as if 3 stars is the baseline, some people as if anything more than 1 is earned at great cost. When you&#x27;re pulling your responses from everyone in the world, I don&#x27;t think you can really get consensus on a scale that goes beyond up / down.",1422818048

There&#x27;s a huge amount of interest in the trucks because they&#x27;re what you can get if you can save/borrow $50K. Here&#x27;s an article from a few years ago which leads with an example of an experienced chef trying to get a venture off the ground and looking at well over $750K just to open the <i>budget</i> version of his restaurant:<p>“If anyone can understand the tension between brick-and-mortar restaurants and the mobile army of food trucks that has stormed D.C. in the past year, it’s Stephan Boillon. After he lost his job at Dino in Cleveland Park in 2008, the veteran chef sought to launch an upscale sandwich shop on Connecticut Avenue NW. His plan was to offer only cold sandwiches, which would enable him to build a restaurant with no burners, no oven, and no deep fryers.<p>But even Boillon’s stripped-down concept was going to cost $750,000 before the doors opened—a figure that didn’t include rent, utilities, insurance, advertising, taxes, labor, association fees, or any of the other overhead it takes to operate a business in a neighborhood that expects a lot from its entrepreneurs.<p>So with credit tight and investment money scarce, Boillon found a cheaper way into the gourmet sandwich business: a food truck. For $50,000, one-fifteenth of the price to build his brick-and-mortar concept, Boillon started El Floridano, his rolling unit dedicated to home-made roast-pork Cubans and other bread-driven bites. Boillon had traded a restaurant’s higher profit margin for a truck’s lower start-up costs.“<p><a href=""http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/39815/inside-dc-food-truck-wars/full/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/39815/inside-dc-...</a>",1422817966

Precise errors are particularly important when the programmer seeing the errors is not familiar with the code.<p>> We understand that this is a point of contention. There are many things in the Go language and libraries that differ from modern practices, simply because we feel it&#x27;s sometimes worth trying a different approach.<p>I was wondering how the &quot;go test&quot; function was working as well, here is a start of an answer: <a href=""http://golang.org/doc/faq#How_do_I_write_a_unit_test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/faq#How_do_I_write_a_unit_test</a>",1422817523

If I may offer two suggestions:<p>- Can you show hospitals without average wait times? I just tried the app and it doesn&#x27;t show me my preferred ER because medicare.gov doesn&#x27;t have any wait time listed for it. That might weed out good ERs for no reason. (It&#x27;s my HMO&#x27;s hospital. I would travel 2 extra miles in nearly all cases for ER staff that have direct access to my medical records, the easy insurance situation, and the super easy followup with my doctors.)<p>- A way to search ERs by manually entering a location, not just showing the nearest. Unfortunately, my parents have a habit of calling me rather than calling 911 or just going to the nearest ER. While 99% of the time it&#x27;s the ER near their home, sometimes I need to look it up. They&#x27;re averse to learning any new app :(",1422817470

10936768,comment,10936188,10936457,0,0,einrealist,,,"Branching adds too much &quot;meta complexity&quot;. That is complexity that you cannot track in actual deployed code. You need processes to manage the branches and to determine when and how to merge. And merging branches is always an error prone process itself. And if you have one deployment target, like a web application, you probably need several staging environments for your branches, so branching does not become the bottleneck towards production. Also if you have test code that is maintained elsewhere (e.g. UI tests), that code cannot reflect your feature changes transparently.<p>In comparison to that: feature toggles. You need one branch (developers can still can have private branches). And the transitions are transparent in your code. Actually, all the complexity is forwarded to the code and toggle management. Most people understand the concept of toggles better than branching workflows / processes. Toggles are easier to test and your tests do reflect that features are changing.<p>I made my decision. I will never have official branches again in any of the projects I supervise.",1453279786

For all we know the guy thought she was flirting back at him and feels terribly guilty about misreading the situation (although I personally doubt it). I&#x27;ve seen (and experienced, but thankfully not like this) countless men and women make these types of mistakes. Communication is difficult, and flirting all the more.<p>However, and in my opinion it&#x27;s a <i>very</i> important however, I see two reasons why despite our distance to the situation, we can solidly agree that the manager was out of line:<p>1. He&#x27;s a manager. Power is a tricky thing. If you&#x27;re in a position of power, you need to wield it with responsibility. If it means <i>never</i> having romantic/sexual/flirty interactions with a subordinate, so be it. It&#x27;s just too risky. My father is a church leader and he never meets women one-on-one, both for his and her &#x27;protection&#x27;, so to speak.<p>2. It&#x27;s a man&#x27;s world. Whether we like it or not, we live in a society where the power dynamics favor men. That also requires some responsibility, as even just superior physical strength unbalances things by default. When I&#x27;m walking down a street, I often try to be aware of not &#x27;following&#x27; a women if we happen to be going in the same direction (especially if it&#x27;s a darker or less safe area of town). I do this not because I have to do so, but because I know how unsettling (or scary and threatening) it can to feel like someone is following you, both from stories of my female friends, and from my own (undoubtedly less-scary) experience as a, uh, &#x27;small, skinny boy&#x27;.<p>Now there are not always rules or laws that demand all this of a person, but it strikes me as basic decency to regularly reflect on what &#x27;power&#x27; you might have, overt or otherwise, and how this might affect others.<p>And if someone who is <i>clearly</i> a subordinate feels threatened, then that makes perfect sense.

The first was of a young, city-educated shop owner who had a laptop and internet. Some of the other villagers came over as he showed them pictures of &#x27;nice ladies&#x27; and played music for them. Ever the businessman he offered to download ten tracks for them in exchange for some meat.<p>The other scene was a merchant passing through and selling plastic bowls and such, but also &#x27;dumb&#x27; cellphones. Cue a scene of three guys excitedly comparing ringtones.<p>What amazed me was not just the rapid technological progress in this village, but how different individuals made extremely different jumps. One guy was excited about phones with fancy ringtones, but the other, in that same small village was already &#x27;facebooking&#x27; with a Chinese girl on his laptop.<p>What strikes me is that the way &#x27;we&#x27; think about something like facebook is very different from this villager (and I suppose the other villagers in due time).<p>For many of us, Facebook is a product that developed over time and one that exists in an ecosystem of social platforms and has a dynamic with its users. We remember older, often national social networks, fondly or otherwise, we discuss the pro&#x27;s and cons of current social networks, we have already invested time and content into these social networks, and these products have shaped us and vice versa.<p>But for places like this village, Facebook is a brand-new thing that just appeared with no history or context. They might have no knowledge at all of how Facebook &#x27;should&#x27; be used (although I suspect this knowledge travels quickly). Hell, even many of those who grew up with Facebook have that one older family member who somehow thinks each of your posts is meant for them and they respond and like them all!<p>It&#x27;s a bit like the difference between dating someone you grew up with and a &#x27;mail-order bride (groom?)&#x27; from a different culture.

I used punched cards IRL as a student, and I had to decode occasionally when there was a problem with the printing on the card. Not a big deal.<p>The real &quot;nightmares&quot; came about when you punched a program, trudged down to the computer center, read it in, and then waited anywhere between 5 minutes and 24 hours before the computer operator took a bunch of output from the line printer, separated the individual jobs, and placed the output in racks for you to retrieve. And then you found out you had a syntax error.<p>One plus side was that, since this took so much time, you learned to take a little care in writing your program and in checking it for typos before submitting it. That sort of discipline turns out to be quite useful in many activities in later life.<p>On another plus side, the cards were made of relatively thick paper, and there was only printing on one side. So the flip side of an unpunched card was absolutely great for writing little notes.<p>Those, sadly, are just about the only &quot;plus sides&quot; I can think of for punched cards.

You may be switching your controllers on and off, but are you also toggling your static assets such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript?<p>People are often scared of feature branches because of large, tricky merge conflicts. However, large, tricky merge conflicts warn you (noisily) of problems such as these before your code gets into production.

If it did, someone could simply copy down the conversion sequence and recode it for a different environment. As a result, Mathematica users are in the position of accepting results whose genesis is concealed.",1453276905

The open source tools that exist are indeed inferior and that&#x27;s why I cannot use them.<p>However, this is not a good argument, as my field is physics. I do believe that the use of mathematica for science is a inherently bad thing, and should not be considered an allowed part of doing science -- because it is closed source.<p>I consider the reductionistic part of science very important, so when I use some function in mathematica I do not know exactly how it is implemented hence I cannot reduce my result beyond the point of &quot;Wolfram says it is ok.&quot;. But that is not ok.<p>I have been lucky with all of my results, in the sense that one can check them by hand or by inferior products. But finding the result to begin with is why mathematica is almost necessary for a lot of calculations.",1453276836

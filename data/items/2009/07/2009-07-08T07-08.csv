When, in reality, an RHEL released package is probably at least as well-vetted for security as the latest release from upstream.<p>But, in this case, since there is no known exploit (and it is possibly fictional), there's nothing vendors can possibly do about the problem.

They'd get dropped onto the belt and dissassembled completely by the first 10 or so people, then the individual parts would be tested as they moved along the line.  Good parts were collected in bins and eventually moved down the line to assembly stations.  Bad parts, stickered lids, and cockroaches would be allowed to roll down the belt and eventually off the end.<p>Once the pieces were collected, the machines would be re-assembled from scratch as they moved down the line.  Some jobs, like screwing on the razor-sharp ""tins"" were terrible.   Routing wires and screwing on lids was OK.  My second summer there, I got the prime job on the line:  Testing.<p>My job for the entire summer was to essentially play the first level of Super Mario all day, every day, on every machine that came past.

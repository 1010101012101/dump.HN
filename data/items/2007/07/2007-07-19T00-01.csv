35133,story,,,4,4,cellis,"is YC suited for game devs?",,"Well, is it? I have an idea for a game and have most of the codebase done. I am an avid reader of YC news and notice that a lot of the posters are into either enterprise software, or social networking/web 2.0 applications. I am a yc hopeful...but wondering if I should be looking elsewhere. What do you think?",1184806454

Picture this (it's just a quick example): you can create an online store where the web frontend is developed with one of the aforementioned frameworks because it'll allow you to add new features quickly but when the client puts in an order for something you put a message in a JMS queue and use some j2ee application to process that order because this background process doesn't change much and it may be faster to develop with this technology.",1184805078

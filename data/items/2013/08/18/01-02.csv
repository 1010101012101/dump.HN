You could do a number of interesting things, like, say, disagree with it or suggest improvements. But if you&#x27;re idea of a critique is &quot;this is long and boring and I know this stuff&quot;, I suggest simply finding other reading material instead.",1376791144

When you close it and re-open the window, the cache will be thrown away (along with any cookies, localstorage, etc.). During your incognito session, cache and cookies and everything is stored. If they didn&#x27;t do this, websites would not function properly.<p>I believe the incognito mode has more potential than it&#x27;s currently being used as. For example multiple parallel sessions would be not only nice and handy, if people learned to use it, the isolation would also enhance browser security. As I mentioned on the page, it single-handedly eliminates a number of https attacks and tracking methods.<p>Edit: Oh you mean that bug in this demonstration? Yes that&#x27;s a local issue here. In practice the two sessions could not be linked, as you can see when you press f5 in the incognito window.

6231268,comment,6230403,6231083,25,0,reeses,,,"Symptoms.<p>People lack, for want of a better word, meaning in life.  They&#x27;re looking for it in various places, whether that be via the frisson from buying that glass hummingbird at Gump&#x27;s or getting a new job selling advertising space on the web.<p>That this is a &#x27;first world&#x27; problem is a sign of affluence.  You&#x27;re bouncing against the ceiling of Maslow&#x27;s &#x27;esteem&#x27; and failing to break into &#x27;self-actualization&#x27;.<p>When you look at these people wondering at the angst they feel because they can&#x27;t believe they made poor choices in buying not just twice the amount of stuff they need, but three, four, or ten times as much, it&#x27;s because they live in a society that has (more or less) solved hunger, personal safety, social interaction, etc.<p>There&#x27;s this middle ground where they can see that they&#x27;re unhappy.  They can&#x27;t see what would make them happy, only things that would make them unhappy.  They look at people who don&#x27;t have the current source of unhappiness and they see that those people do not seem less happy for their lack of possessions.  &quot;Oh, it must be my attachment to tchotchkes that causes my unhappiness.  If I get rid of everything, I will be happy.&quot;<p>In many cases, this &quot;meaning&quot; was provided by religion or by an extended family.  Some &quot;higher purpose&quot;, whether it was preparing the next generation for the future, or their souls for a post-physical existence.  In many cases, it&#x27;s a &quot;legacy&quot; that is a third way to immortality.<p>People have to reach a point of deciding if &quot;happiness&quot; is the optimization they need or want.  A friend uses the phase &quot;Budweiser and NASCAR&quot; for the condescending view of the basest American pursuit of short-term happiness or amusement.  This is just another form of that, just of a different social class.<p>Looking at the 99% or the developing (or failed) countries is still an externality.  It can help frame the scope of your unhappiness, but it is irrelevant how happy you are related to a child soldier in Somalia.  You can be grateful for your fortune and privilege, and that can be a good thing, but you&#x27;re not interchangeable.<p>Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no royal road to enlightenment.  It is, and should be, hard work.  Knowing yourself and discerning what is truly important takes a lot of honesty and reflection.  You&#x27;ll have to redefine superficial and deep, as well as a lot of other labels.  You&#x27;ll have to figure out your worldview, your true values and principles, and how far you are from becoming the person you want or need to be.",1376791013

If companies operated by giving people a few-week chance to prove themselves they&#x27;d be able to give more people more opportunities and have a much better idea of who was worth keeping.<p>But of course, with the current system if you get fired after two weeks you&#x27;re looking at trying to get hired at a bunch of other companies that are going to view that as a Bad Thing and are going to try to get as much info from a few interviews before they jump into bed with you for years.

6231263,comment,6230355,6230862,1,0,ak217,,,"As sigstoat said, Kepler is a fairly recent spacecraft. And yeah, it&#x27;s interesting that they don&#x27;t treat spacecraft like this as small-batch production runs. The incremental cost of producing 5 Kepler replicas and keeping equipment and processes documented at the time of initial production seems very small compared to doing the same project all over again a decade later. Even if they have to do some major changes, I imagine having a ready to go spacecraft helps.<p>On the flipside, I guess the arguments for componentization apply. If off-the-shelf components are improving all the time, integrating them into a full spacecraft should be getting cheaper and easier over time.<p>What I really wonder about is, given how troublesome and relatively lightweight gyros are, why didn&#x27;t they have more spares?",1376790907

6231123,comment,6230265,6230265,4,0,trevelyan,,,"Advice from a bootstrapped/non-funded entrepreneur. If you have funding or are scaling extremely quickly maybe none of this applies:<p>* don&#x27;t hire anyone to do work you have not personally done. You need to know how long it takes and what kind of effort is involved or else on-boarding is difficult.<p>* unless your startup has revenue and is profitable, don&#x27;t pay someone a higher salary than you are getting. Doing so can breed resentment on your part.<p>* don&#x27;t offer equity if you can avoid it: no-one else thinks your company is as valuable as you do anyway.<p>* don&#x27;t get hung up about a CS degree unless it is necessary for the work. For most web-development you need someone who is SMART and ENTHUSIASTIC, and who is a fast-learner with a track record of getting stuff done and an interest in web-development. Plenty of liberal arts majors have these skills.<p>* someone should know about 80% of what they need in order to be fully productive. This means you shouldn&#x27;t sweat stuff like knowledge of MVC or particular frameworks. This is where the fast-learner and enthusiasm bit comes in, and it can be a good excuse for setting up a probationary period.<p>* interns have always ended up being more work for me than they are worth when asked to work independently, but if you are willing to spend time supervising and can work closely with them in a way that ties closely into your own workflow (I am working on X and need Y done now) they can be a real effort multiplier.<p>* if you can afford it, pay people well. This is not always possible, but it is so much easier dealing with someone who is paid decently, because they won&#x27;t feel taken advantage of and will more likely give you the benefit of the doubt when you start freaking out under pressure or act poorly because of stress. Not that you should do this.<p>* finally - CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH - in the event of conflict, you need to deal with it personally in one-on-one conversation rather than through email. This avoids miscommunication and keeps both sides from internalizing grievances.",1376788199

Maybe people &quot;spending time&quot; on these things would help advance the state of the art.<p>Case study #1: PC hardware was commoditized under the Microsoft/Wintel model which made hardware &quot;open&quot; in the sense of interoperability. On the bright side, hardware was cheap. However, the dark side of this is that hardware makers couldn&#x27;t really profit and invest into R&D. So for a long time we got heavy, ugly, clunky, beige boxes that gulped electricity.<p>Case study #2: The web was a happening place of innovation when Netscape earned a profit.

The web plunged into a dark ages period from which we are still recovering.<p>Is it a good thing that operating systems and utilities are being commoditized by open source?

Sometimes, exactly what you need is a company that profits handsomely selling proprietary products, in order to push an industry forward.<p>Commoditizing things and making them cheap (so no one works on them anymore) is a double-edged sword that is not necessarily good.

Both the mental state and prohibited substantive act/result of a crime are parts of &quot;what matters.&quot;<p>I suspect we might just have an irreconcilable difference of framework in that respect:<p>I view the purpose of law to be to minimise the maximise the public good while causing the minimum restriction of freedoms. That being inherently a balancing act, freedom/security, the exact value of which is responsible for a lot of the problems with the actual application of law.<p>In that framework whether someone&#x27;s acts resulted in death is dramatically less important than whether they were likely to, and whether the person who did it is likely to do so again unless restrained. (That their acts actually did lead to the death is evidence in favour of that class of act being more likely to lead to deaths than it would be without that bit of evidence, so in that sense it matters.)<p>Beyond that, whether someone dies or not, the drink driver and the speeder who didn&#x27;t kill anyone but committed equally dangerous offences - they&#x27;re all guilty of murder in the sense that matters to me. To borrow the way of phrasing it from the Christians: They&#x27;ve all already killed people in their hearts.

Blame the patent system, again...<p>However, the lack of compressed textures, or any other specific feature isn't WebGL's biggest problem.  It really is hardware compatibility.  WebGL is the first web technology to expose significant hardware variations (with bonus buggy drivers!) directly to web content, and web developers aren't equipped to handle that.  Deploying a WebGL app with any hope of wide compatibility will require testing on at least 3 and more likely 10+ different hardware/driver/os configurations, and the fact that a GPU is required makes automated testing difficult (VMs don't work, remote desktop solutions often don't work, driver crashes hang machines).",1313362719

IMO just because you can slap a couple of ""virtual joysticks"" on the screen and pull input data from them does not mean you have a system that replicates dual-analog sticks, and I say that as both a programmer and a gamer.<p>They do almost replicate the joysticks. I never said it's a good replacement.<p>> Like I said, for some games, yes, you can have good touchscreen controls. But by limiting the system to only touchscreen controls you're cutting out a giant amount of games that could otherwise run fine on the hardware but whose controls do not naturally map to touchscreen.<p>You can make similar arguments against the PS3 or Xbox controllers for not having GPS, Touchscreen, or microphone inputs for controllers. Games take advantage of certain controls because they are made available, if they aren't available, you can adapt.<p>For the Wii and DS if they started abandoning the new ways of inputs and controls, it's only because the old style controls are still there. It's <i>hard</i> to change the way controls are designed and adapt to new inputs so obviously they'd stick to the standard controls if they are still there.",1313362578

My experience has been that individuals new to the CF community or individuals who have long pursued alternative approaches are the most able to understand and act on the information.  I have come to believe a more information dense delivery mechanism would be helpful.  I don't personally see any reason to believe that normal research channels are the way to go with this.  I like being helpful.  I just don't feel obligated to cram my views down anyone's throat and most members of the CF community have made it abundantly clear that they have no interest in what I am doing.  I see no reason to either fight with people or martyr myself.  The information is there if someone is interested and has already helped some people.

As I said, I am happy for you, but you need to be very careful when making claims as you do since lives are at stake. If you are going to post information that CF patients might act upon it is your responsibility to put it into appropriate context, try to disprove it yourself, and be open to alternative theories as to why your approach worked other than that you have cured your CF through consuming sea salt and tonic water.<p>The history of CF is full of stories like yours where people seem to be onto something only to find out that it was circumstantial or not scalable to the rest of the CF population. This is still a very mysterious disease. My point is that a large part of the reason you might not be taken seriously is due to your tone, your apparent skepticism of western medicine, and your lack of expertise on the fields you are making claims about.<p>If you do not want to try to use the information you have to help others, so be it. But if you do, posting on health lists and arguing over the internet is not the way to do it. The way to do it is to educate yourself enough that you can hold a real discussion with medical researchers, and find medical researchers (or become one yourself) who would be willing to test your claims empirically. You've positioned yourself as a champion against the establishment, and this is not the way to actually get anything meaningful accomplished. Posting anecdotal evidence, contradictory claims, and lots of random speculations about the effects of various foods and dietary changes without accurate measurement and study does little good towards this end, if the goal is to help the wider CF community, despite your intentions to be helpful.",1313361198

You need an explicit contract, real enforcement, and oversight.  This is why charities have things like mission statements, operational guidelines, and independent audits, and why the law gets involved when there's misappropriation of funds.  This is why we have things like Charity Navigator.<p>When you don't have those things, you get a situation like this -- funds get directed to causes the donors did not intend.  As misappropriations go, this one was relatively tame; rather than giving coffee money to starving children, someone might use ""feed the children"" money to bomb a bus in the Middle East, or ""stand up for the Constitution"" money to fund McVeigh type domestic terrorism.<p>Some sort of abuse was inevitable with the way Jonathan's Card was set up.  I'm sad that Sam chose to abuse it, since he's a valued member of this community and it sucks to see him alienate so many.

Yes, the vast majority of conversations are banal, and always have been. The only difference is that, because of social networking, we now have a lasting record of how mundane our conversations are. Most conversations are not three-hour monologues about the End of History (and thank God for that). That doesn't mean that the quality of discussion has declined, or that we are in a post-idea era. It just means that throwaway small talk is located on the same global platform as the big ideas.<p>A positive side effect is that the <i>interesting</i> conversations are now available to everyone. For example, most chatter in a Philadelphia bar in 2011 is of no interest to anyone except the people having the conversation, but chatter in a Philadelphia bar in 1776 would make a fascinating read. I sure wish we had a record of that. Take Twitter as an example, since Gabler singles it out for criticism. Most of the time, I don't care what Muhammad Everyman in Cairo is tweeting about, because the quality level is the same as that of ordinary conversation. But when a revolution breaks out, I can listen in on tens of thousands of conversations talking about what is happening on a street-by-street level. Conversation is mundane, except when it isn't.<p>As for the comment about the Internet following a sort of Gresham's Law, with trivial information pushing out the big ideas, I think it's off the mark. Nothing is getting pushed out because there is nothing to get pushed out <i>of</i>. More bytes of kitten photos does not mean less bytes of Nietzsche.

In one of the incidents they talked about the suspect <i>did</i> have a gun and reportedly <i>did</i> shoot at police. I mean seriously, do they really think the police are in the habit of shooting people over fare evasion?<p>I'm no fan of police, and I support protest groups - but there's a difference between protesters with a grievance, and hooligans looking for an excuse. From what I've seen, previous BART protests have been more the latter than the former.<p>I am sick and tired of ""anarchists"" subjugating every legitimate cause under the sun so they can have an excuse to deface and destroy. Not only is what they do juvenile and unproductive, but their presence taints what are otherwise very legitimate and important grievances and seriously compromises public opinion and support of these causes.<p>There is not a single group I despise more than your average black bloc ""anarchist protester"".

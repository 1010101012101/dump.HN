2605231,comment,2604264,2605134,1,0,ksolanki,,,"I agree that colleges are really expensive and they are getting more expensive by day. This still does not take away the fact that college education and, in larger context, the existence of (high-reputation) Universities, is vital to society. The solution is to make colleges less expensive somehow, not to replace colleges with unregulated mentorships (which as I said earlier, will be effective only in hands of good mentors). There are numerous countries where college education is highly subsidized by the Government (example, India, where I went to college -- paid a total of $120/year as fees, for a top college). Universities also employ many scientists as professors and have a very good research output, that certainly has a bearing on our scientific progress.",1306886313

A single core CPU will do all those in less than a minute. Five (all combinations... the entire space) in less than an hour.<p>Modern GPUs can enumerate the entire six char space within a day or so. Some GPUs can enumerate the seven char space in a few days. Complete enumeration begins to get infeasible when you get into the eight char space. This is basically why CPUs are still viable. Speed won't get you nearly as far as intelligence will (append stuff onto the end of words). Nothing against speed here and if it was a pure enumeration race, then no doubt, go with GPUs.<p>Edit: When I say ""entire space"" I mean the entire printable ASCII character set.<p>Edit2: It's rather simple to calculate too. 95 printable ASCII chars to the power of the password length. So, to enumerate the four char space, it's 95^4 (81,450,625). You can ""do the math"" for any lenght password.

2605157,comment,2603844,2604415,6,0,chipsy,,,"It's hard to say. Microsoft can push out new products with splashy announcements, TV ads, etc. Similarly, they can afford to do ""proper engineering"" these days. But Microsoft as a startup, and as a growing company, was extremely unscrupulous. Likewise, the majority of the ""scrappy"" web startups cheat on their tech and cheat on their marketing, in the hope that they can find traction before they lose goodwill, and get profitable so that they can go back and fix the system before it blows up.<p>On a personal level this is very frustrating, because we like everyone we know to behave in a honest and straightforward fashion. But from a business standpoint there is a huge tradition of using some amount of misdirection to push new products to people. Parallels can be made with the animal kingdom and the use of camouflage, bright colors, and social interactions. Sometimes your business is in a position to strut your stuff, because you're the lion in the room. Other times you have to sneak around or be deceptive. Sometimes, fragile, trust-breaking tactics work - at least for a time.<p>In the end, the real condemnation for this behavior has to come from yourself, not from others. The market sees what is in front of it at the moment; it rarely knows the truth.",1306884989

I've had interesting experiences at some of these other places wrt. to safety etc., but that's a story for another day.<p>In Switzerland, though, I think it's important to keep a few things in mind when you look at the statistics, before you judge it as a heavily armed country:<p>- It's mandatory for every male to serve in the army, where we are all issued rifles. We get to keep the rifles at home when not on duty, and get to keep them after our duties are complete should we wish to. This makes up a huge part of the guns owned in CH. Military rifles are very hard to conceal and do not make for very good armed robbery weapons.<p>- While guns are common, ammunition is hard to come by. Military ammunition is only given while on-duty, and must be returned to the arsenal when not on-duty. While many people have guns, few have ammunitions.<p>- For almost everybody, guns remain locked in the attic / basement to be used only should the military call.",1306884814

Latin America is a huge space (a population of 580,086,590 which the parent seeks to generalize), there are various cultures and subcultures, various languages and dialects. Whatever J. Lo has brainwashed people into thinking is ""Latin American"" is not all-encompassing and should not be representative of it.<p>Thus, Buenos Aires is just as very Latin American as La Paz or San Juan or Rio de Janeiro or Havana.<p>The fact that more Italians immigrated to Argentina does not make them more ""European"", since Spain, the country that colonized most of Latin America is European. Since its colonization, Latin America adopted a lot of traditions from Spain and the rest of Europe, thanks to many Latin American governments asking for more European immigrants to ""fill the void"" and work the land. However, not all countries adopted the same traditions to the same degree and some preferred other European traditions (that could also be shared with Spain, Portugal and the rest of Western Europe).<p>Thus, the statement ""Buenos Aires is not particularly representative of Latin America, it's more like a hybrid between LatAm and Europe"" is wrong because most of Latin America includes Europe in its transculturation, acculturation, syncretism, miscegenation and hybridity.",1306883357

I arrived a local pond and immediately saw a man slapping the water and grunting.  He was just past where he could stand.  My lifeguard training kicked in and I immediately realized he was drowning.  I starting yelling for help and jumped in the pond to save him.<p>Then I stopped.<p>My training said I was never supposed to go into the water without a floatation device.  Without evaluating if that made sense in this case -- the pond was perfectly flat and the guy was maybe 3 feet past where I could stand -- I jumped out of the water and tried to find a floatation device.  I ended up with an inflatable couch, which was absolutely enormous and would not have helped at all.<p>Luckily at that point another guy had heard me yelling and started swimming toward the drowning man.  He got to him within a few seconds and with two strokes was back to where he could stand.  Everybody was fine.<p>Training is a blessing and a curse. There are plenty of cases where people jump in fast moving water to save somebody and die as a result.  I'm sure firefighters are told endlessly about such cases: never enter a burning building, go on ice, jump in water, etc.  But these dangers don't always exist or are often remote. In my case, the training taught me to recognize the signals of drowning, but also taught me not to use common sense.  It turned out okay, but could very well have gone differently.",1306883121

Just like it's useful to know the algorithm for multiplying two numbers, and it's not useful to keep doing multiplication by hand.<p>What lets people invent new circuits is their good intuition about circuits, <i>not</i> their ability to solve linear differential equations quickly by hand or to compute integrals by hand. When an expert is analyzing a circuit on paper he is thinking about ""what happens if the input to this circuit is a sine wave with high frequency"", he's not going to solve the differential equations by hand.<p>Rather than circuits look at how electromagnetism or quantum mechanics is taught in college. In my case it was integrals, integrals, integrals. Doing these by hand provided approximately zero intuition into the physics. We could have covered more ground if the instructor would just type these into maple, instead of doing them on the board or in the book by hand. Or how many times have I not had to compute eigenvalues of 2x2 or 3x3 matrices. How many times have we not applied crude approximations in class because doing it by hand was too difficult, when typing it into a compute would give you 100 digits of precision in a couple of milliseconds. One time one of my maths teachers how to compute tan(2) or something like that by hand. After half an hour of calculation he had 2 digits.

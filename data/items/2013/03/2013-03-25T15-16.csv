Breaking lines, causing ""false"" visual structure destroy's Python's readability.<p>Seeing more logic vertically is far more important than horizontal.<p>I've been on teams that choose horrible names, used strange constructs, etc. just cause they fit on 80 char.  Also wasting huge amount of time getting shit under 80char.  Oh, and 80 char leads to people using import from over import (to avoid fully qualified names), which introduces bugs (name conflicts) and tons of confusion / lookup time wasted figuring out ""process"" is from some.lib and is not local,, or the one from some.other.lib",1364227188

I understand what you're trying to achieve, but I think you could present it in a way that doesn't look so manipulative. If you make it easy to link to one of your pages, lots of travel blogs and sites will give you backlinks without you needing to create links to every possible combination on your site.<p>Even the URLs look unnecessarily verbose:<p><a href=""http://www.doineedavisafor.com/visa/us-citizen/travelling/afghanistan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doineedavisafor.com/visa/us-citizen/travelling/af...</a><p>Why is the word ""travelling"" in the URL? I assume it's because you feel strongly that you will get indexed more prominently if someone uses that word in their search. I wouldn't count on that.

5437673,comment,5436993,5437549,2,0,Chris_Newton,,,"<i>is there a way to alias it to a function local name such as my_handy_function = <the above></i><p>I agree, though of course a single function call is a trivial example. It would be nice if we made more use of intermediate variables for exposition to simplify complicated expressions more generally, too. But somehow this sort of idea rarely seems to get promoted whenever long lines come up in discussion. :-(<p><i>You need a better editor. That is a solved problem.</i><p>I respectfully disagree. Current editors, even the most flexible, rarely do more than automatically sorting out line breaks and indentation, and rarely provide more viewing options than collapsing blocks and jumping around to one cross reference or another. I am challenging the assumption that even the same symbols in the same order are necessarily appropriate in different contexts.<p>I think there is a parallel here with the idea that a variable or function name can be relatively short if its only used locally with the full context available, but it might be better to use a longer, more detailed name or to add full qualifiers like which package/module/scope the entity lives in if its going to be used more widely. This is a simple case of adaptation that many programmers would apply instinctively, but it illustrates the basic principle that using the same name/representation for an idea regardless of context isnt always helpful.<p><i>Break it up into functions.</i><p>But at the moment, breaking something into functions for ease of presentation typically equates to breaking something into functions to establish an independent scope, to allow wider reuse, or for other non-presentational reasons.<p>For example, most languages offer no way to break down a moderately long pipeline algorithm into stages without separating each stage into its own function, complete with manually passing all of the context in and passing all of the results back. If many stages depend on much the same general context for that algorithm and the stages dont make much sense outside of the algorithm as a whole, might we not consider some sort of lightweight, presentational way to split things up for better readability, without implying all the side effects and maintenance overheads of full functional decomposition?",1364226879

But while I love a lot of features in Postgres, my big caveat with it is that Postgres seems to have an attitude of ""if we can't do it perfectly, we won't do it yet"", and so we only got ""proper"" replication recently (or had to deal with third party hacks on top of triggers or the like) and still can't do multi-master replication without third party hacks.<p>Meanwhile, MySQL have had multi-master replication ""forever"" because they took the easy way out of ""simply"" logging statements, and streaming those to slaves, and add a mechanism for adding offsets and step sizes to sequences. It's a bit of a hack, and vulnerable (if you do clashing updates, replication will fail), but in real life usage it gave MySQL a massive advantage for some types of scenarios for a long time (e.g. back in 2006 I ran a cluster of 16 MySQL servers spread over two sites; configuration was trivial while doing the same with Postgres at the time was a massive PITA).<p>It's a philosophical difference that means that while I'd be more comfortable about trusting our payroll data to Postgres, for a web app where major scalability is a concern, I'd be prepared to consider MySQL in situations where I'd consider Postgres a no-go because of the hassle.<p>Postgres feels like it has a more theoretically sound foundation, and is catching up feature-wise, though.<p>A few more iterations on the replication support, and extensions like <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/plv8js/wiki/PLV8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/plv8js/wiki/PLV8</a> (run Javascript in Postgres via V8, which also instantly gives nice JSON support to rival many of the no-sql solutions) and it's eating it's way into both the no-sql space and the space held by MySQL.",1364225176

<a href=""http://youtu.be/7SkWxEUXIoM?t=29s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/7SkWxEUXIoM?t=29s</a>
The drag near the solid surface greatly slows down, and introduces turbulence to, an otherwise laminar flow. This means that the air near the surface of the earth is doing a lot more interacting with the earth than the other air, and is getting and keeping a lot more heat and dissolved gases. Above that turbulent layer, you just have cold dry air. It loses heat, water condenses, gases fall out.<p>What can you use as an indicator for the height of the wet air layer? The height of the local trees! Their tops are about at the top of the survivable boundary layer in the air. Desert plants are short, rainforest plants are tall. Interestingly, this might lead you to wonder where the tallest trees in the world are.<p>Probably in some place where there's an ocean wind that blows into a blind valley, right?

Beyond a token comment on not nesting too deeply, and a token reply that sometimes deep nesting really is tidier than artificially separating the inner levels somehow, we rarely consider whether <i>what</i> were representing is fit for purpose. Does it really make sense to take the basic syntax we use for short expressions like<p><pre><code>    short_name(easy_param, other_param)
</code></pre>
and try to apply it to longer expressions like<p><pre><code>    full_project_name.useful_package_name.handy_function(first_param,

or something more complicated than a single function call? This leads to a debate where the most radical alternative proposed might be something like<p><pre><code>    full_project_name.useful_package_name.handy_function(
        first_param, second_param, third_param)
</code></pre>
If you look at well typeset mathematics, which suffers a similar problem of scalability, there are often (at least) two different conventions for representing the same mathematical expression. For example, maths set using the TeX family probably has one version designed to read neatly in-line with other text, but another version designed to be clearer when set as a standalone display that might cross several lines.<p>There are many tools for tidying up those displays, aligning things in logical ways. There are also conventions for breaking expressions too wide to fit on a single line, and sometimes those conventions do opposite things when setting an expression in-line to in displayed form, for example when deciding whether to leave a trailing + at the end of one line or move it to the start of the next. There is also a general idea that if youre dealing with a lot of expressions that dont fit, you should be looking to define self-contained parts of those expressions separately, and incorporate them indirectly using a more concise notation within the larger expressions. There are even subtle cross-references like numbering the key equations (only) and then adding a note like by (1) and (2) in the margin to help the reader navigate a complicated series of results. All of these ideas fit <i>within</i> the broader typography of setting a paper or thesis, where you still want good general readability in terms of (physical) line lengths, numbers of columns, use of tables, positioning of displayed content, and so on.<p>In programming, we have some of the same basic ideas, particularly separating out smaller parts of a larger whole as separate functions or variables for exposition, but we havent really developed the same depth of typographical conventions. Almost everything is based on the idea of taking that basic syntax that works on a single line for relatively short expressions and trying to make it work for arbitrarily large expressions across many lines with nothing but a line break and fixed tab/space characters as tools.<p>I think this is partly because our text-based editors typically dont separate the meaning of our code from its layout. Even ideas like elastic tab stops, which might be everyday alignment tools in programming languages that use meaningful indentation, are still esoteric. A few functional languages promote ideas like let x in y or x where y syntax to help separate out subexpressions, but on the scale of functions separation implies creating a new self-contained function to do part of the work, which comes with its own scope, which means explicitly passing values in and out when they were already conveniently available in the all-in-one function.<p>I dont see the controversy over X characters per line limits going anywhere until we get over these more fundamental problems of conflating code layout/presentation with code meaning. We need to be able to express the ideas in our programs systematically and have our editors and diff tools and code review software present those ideas in a suitable layout that adapts to both the idea itself and its context. Sadly, thats not going to happen as long as we keep asking questions like how wide a tab stop should be, and not asking questions like whether we should even have tab stops at all.",1364224485

A lot of people rail against ""arbitrary limits"" and ""arbitrary style guidelines"" as it's something extra they need to learn and adds no value (according to them). I've seen people here for 6+ months again still fighting this.<p>Such things (IMHO) have value as it adds a reasonable level of consistency across teams, it avoids commits on files due to stylistic changes (which may or may not be automatic from IDEs, etc) and, most importantly, defuses a lot of the aesthetic-driven boneheadedness that we engineers are prone to.<p>The last point is really important. Otherwise you'd have engineers and groups fighting over where to put curly braces, 2 space indents vs 4, whether tabs are OK, etc--none of which actually matters.<p>So if you feel your creativity somehow stifled over 80 characters, I'd strongly suggest you just abosrb it, get over it and move on to things that actually matter.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html#Line_length"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.ht...</a>",1364224262

I could show you perfectly unreadable code that fits in 80 characters because it's legitimately pre-indented by 40 and has to go to one word per line or shorten variable names to fit in 80, and wonderfully easy to read code that goes out to 160 (often because of some literal data that would otherwise just increase the vertical length).<p>Also, it's funny to me that people talk about horizontal line length impacting readability, but never seem to talk about <i>vertical</i> length impacting readability as well. To me it's critical to keep related code clustered vertically as closely as possible without too much brevity: having to scroll/split view to see related pieces of code incurs a cognitive overhead. Arbitrary line breakage imposed by the 80-character limit gets in the way of that. (And don't get me started about teams that treat this as a <i>limit</i> instead of a <i>guideline</i>.)<p>It's critical to give programmers the tools to make their code readable (good languages with good grammar and idioms), not arbitrary restrictions that try and fail to accomplish that indirectly.",1364224254

Although a term from the Heroku platform, I believe it applies to most of the other platforms too. A dyno is a container (sort of like a VM but without hardware virtualisation, see LXC or OpenVZ) that isolates system resources. You can have multiple dynos on any given server and you can have lots of servers. Each dyno contains the entire environment needed by any given app, so it'll contain the specific binary version of ruby or node for example and it'll also have unique copies of all the dependencies, managed via bundler or npm for example.<p>Scaling your app simply means having more running dynos that are load balanced by a centralised load balancer used across the entire platform. So yes, interestingly there is a lot of duplication of the code base.<p>Services, like databases, are managed on their own separate servers/clusters and allow multiple connections and can be scaled/sharded separately from the dyno farms. Therefore they can be monitored, maintained, upgraded, etc, separately as well.<p>I'm a small-time contributor to <a href=""http://github.com/openruko"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/openruko</a>, an opensource Heroku clone.",1364224142

This is largely in part to my lack of familiarity with Scala, but I have really wanted to tackle a large project with it.  I have read the book that Martin Odersky wrote, but this will be an awesome addition that will, hopefully, push me over that final hurdle to becoming productive.  Thank you for posting this!

5437317,comment,5435862,5435862,6,0,nlh,,,"I remember a great discussion my class had in our high school Econ class about why ""pay what you want"" fails so often:<p>The basic working theory of an economic exchange between parties is that the exchange happens because both parties feel like they are getting more value post-exchange than pre-exchange. I agree to pay you $5 for a sandwich because I have decided that the sandwich is more valuable to me (in my hungry state) than this $5 bill (even if only marginally so) and you have decided that $5 in the register is better than keeping the bread, cheese and meat in the kitchen. It works.  If the sandwich were $20, I might not make the same value judgment. Possibly even if it were $7.<p>When you throw ""pay what you want"" into the transaction, in theory, you're actually breaking that structure.  I'm no longer getting MORE value from the sandwich than from my money - by definition, I'm getting exactly the same value.<p>So even though the consumer is deciding on pricing, that subtle feeling of ""getting a deal"" goes away and consumers on the whole actually feel less intrinsically satisfied with the purchase.",1364223842

I won't contest that bad comments are at least as bad as useless, as you doubt would not contest that bad code is at least as bad as useless.<p>When I read a comment, I parse it directly. When I read code, no matter how neat it is, I often trigger a twitch of ""How would I rewrite this?"", which itself gets in the way of understanding.<p>The more code there is, the harder it is going to be to digest at first glance, and if your codebase could be adequately described by a single page of text I would wonder why I need to work on it instead of rewriting it entirely.<p>Hint: if you only have one page of docs, and especially if you have no test suite, I <i>cannot</i> work on the code in a meaningful way safely.<p>If you don't value safety, if you don't value engineering, then by all means omit comments. It's just a crutch for people who can't <i>see the code man</i>.<p>I might also point out that that same philosophy implies that we should just stick with assembly. Especially if you use any language with dynamic types/duck typing (Ruby, Javascript, etc.) seeing ""at a glance"" what exactly is the proper form of data to pass into and out of function can be hard. Documentation here helps.<p>EDIT:<p>Note also that commenting in libraries, or in mathematical or geometric routines, can be <i>really helpful</i>. The code doesn't lie, sure, but if you aren't experienced/schooled/clever enough to recognize what is going on it won't help you.<p>A great example of this is the fast inverse square root hack:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root</a><p>This has great examples of both inscrutable (but honest and short!) code, and shitty commenting.",1364223778

If your development cycle is code -> comment -> code -> comment ... (where you write code and then comment), then your criticism is fair.  But the right way is to comment <i>first</i>.  When you describe what you want in words, then you or anyone else can go back and evaluate if the code matches the words.<p>(In my experience, 90% of bugs stem from developers thinking one thing and implementing something different, and these could be avoided if you had a normative document)<p>It's like writing a paper: you outline, sketch out what you want to say, and then actually start crafting sentences.  The outline should guide your paper, and if there's a problem you first update the outline.",1364223764

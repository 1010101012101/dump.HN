I have been running a small ARM computer at home for doing sshuttle, iodine, and samba over ssh (with port binding) for the past few weeks and it works very well.  I know tcp over tcp is usually not good but it still works quickly for some reason.  This costs less than a VM on Amazon and gives you more flexibility.<p>A nicer sshuttle command for VPN may be:
$ ./sshuttle -v --remote=server_USERNAME@serverIP:port_number --dns 0/0<p>If you sshuttle to your home router you may be able to samba or nfs to the ARM on your home network (using tcp and udp, I think).<p>Alternatively, SSHFS or something more normal could be used for mounting the ARM filesystem without a VPN but if you want to try Samba over SSH you could try:
$ ssh -C -c blowfish -L[host_bind_port]:localhost:445 server_USERNAME@serverIP
$ mkdir /Users/username/mount_spot 
$ mount -t smbfs //server_USERNAME@localhost:[host_bind_port]/server_drive ~/mount_spot<p>Tools like rsync over SSH and UFTP are also nice for moving large files to and from the ARM server.<p>I tried making an instructible on this last week but it's kinda poor: <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Personal-ARM-Cloud-Server/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.instructables.com/id/Personal-ARM-Cloud-Server/</a>",1345553536

Though, now that I think about it, if you were a very bright engineer, would you go into a lackluster career in civil that would start out at $45k and only find small increases in salary now that there is little demand for housing, or would you go into software? So clearly there is going to be brain drain. But I was not referring to market economics. See my point above (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4412278"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4412278</a>).<p>I will say that my point did not suggest ""horror"" - as in <i>horrifying you.</i> Leaking sensitive user data is not, in my opinion, on par with a bridge completely structurally failing while traffic is on it. Unless of course the web app is for a bank. Which is the sort of security work that likely does not have the coffee fetching intern designing its protocols. But even then, I think as a society we are clearly willing to have many more cases of ID theft than deaths from bridge failure.<p>The comparison should be equal: are there bridges that require maintenance more often than is reasonable? Is their lifespan long enough? Are their piers sunk deeply enough to accommodate the scour of the river (we have several bridges here locally that are under restoration efforts because the scour was not adequately considered)? Was the water surface elevation of the design storm of the river accurately predicted to which the answer is realistically always no; there is no such thing as accuracy in backwater analysis - for before one even begins to model the river, one has to assume how MUCH water it could have - and that can vary widely, being a combination of not-always-comprehensive statistical analysis of historical precipitation, stream gauge data, and semi-empirical algorithms - stress on the semi.<p>Now, see my above comment about how civil plans actually get out the door, and I would say this is not a metaphor. We know from experience that if a ""hot new startup"" or even a stodgy old site (linkedIn, eHarmony, Last.FM) loses user data, it is not the end of the world, let alone the end of the startup. If a bridge fails and falls, the PE loses his licence. If the bridge fails and requires extra maintenance, the county and the firm lawyer up and the JDs make a lot of money in court.",1345553082

Crowdfunding will be hard to execute -- novice investors, multiple sources of bad advice, selection biases (the worse companies will attract the 'worser' investors).. the list goes on.<p>With that said there is a lot of genuine interest in the model and there are bound to be atleast a couple of platforms that get traction . If you were YC with access to pick the best possible team to make this happen -- why wouldn't you invest ?? Its such a small portion of your investments and you get that diversification.<p>Second does not matter what your personal convictions are, the only way to know for sure is by trial and error -- who knows crowdfunding maybe the model of the future.<p>Finally you are supporting a good cause -- there is a lot of populist rage against the investor class (not VC's in particular but more wall st types),, allowing companies to go around 'wall st' and giving the lay person a chance to be a part of the next facebook is a great story.<p>My 2 cents.

What looks like a ""lull"" could be a lot of stealth mode activity.<p>TV is a fascinating market that has a few challenges.<p>I have a TV that is hooked up to a computer and a game console.  I used to have a Blu-Ray player attached to the TV,  but I hooked up a portable Blu-Ray writer to the computer,  installed some software,  and removed a bulky thing that had to be positioned awkwardly so it could see the remote control.<p>Blu-Ray disks aren't really ""movies"",  they're really Java applications that have access to a really great multimedia API.  It turns out a computer is much faster as disc loading and interactive features because cost constraints cause standalone players to be underpowered,  even expensive players.<p>For 5.1 sound we have an HTIB.  Add it all up and people who visit our house have a hard time figuring out what remotes to grab and what buttons to press to do simple things.<p>I'd like to see a TV that has a remote control similar to the Wiimote in that I could use it as a light wand,  pointing at things on the screen.<p>The ""multiple remote control"" problem could be solved by using the back channel that's available in HDMI.  Although the PHY is standardized,  the messages aren't,  so this only works if all the stuff connected to your TV comes from the same vendor.  (Samsung or Sony could make a whole suite of products,  but Apple is awfully dogmatic -- if they had any sense you could get a Blu-Ray drive in a mac mini and then have a pretty little package that flattens the alternatives.)<p>Another trouble is economic.  A TV could have a ten year or more lifespan,  but the electronic package in it will be becoming obsolete in five or so,  particularly if they economize it.<p>The cable box is another barrier.  The cable companies are going to resist anything that makes TVoIP easy.  Yet,  cable delivers a huge amount of entertainment,  and a super TV will only be super if it delivers a super experience watching cable.<p>As disappointing as it is, Apple could be making a very reasonable choice to get into cable boxes,  since that is the place that would be the hardest to integrate into other systems.",1345552217

Controllers or mutator methods no longer handle post-action tasks, they just announce what they did, and any interested listeners can act upon the event announced. This way we can have a listener that handles (for example) all post-action emailing, and we can test the logic for that in isolation. Controller logic is cleaned up too, so testing them becomes easier. On the flip side we have to write more comprehensive integration tests to make sure our listeners are all hooked up correctly, but it seems like a pretty good trade-off so far.<p>Enjoyed the OP nonetheless, though - I didn't know about ActiveModel#previous_changes, that's pretty nifty to have.",1345552080

      if (maybeMonad.maybe === ""just"") {
        return maybeJust(f(maybeMonad.just)); // expects f to return a value without any maybe stuff ('a -> b')
        // notice that the monad wrapping remains separate from f

    // usage

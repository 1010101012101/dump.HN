10640838,comment,10636537,10636537,0,0,adventured,,,"It&#x27;s not a coincidence that separation point in the chart begins shortly after the Fed began heavily harming the US dollar and promoting a bubble dependent economy based on asset inflation schemes (the first point of separation represents the real estate bubble and the beginning of the 2005-2007 soft bubble of the stock market). You can also witness the exact same spike in the GDP of every other country on earth when priced in US Dollars, nicely showing off how dramatically the Fed was harming the currency (give it a try, type in: &quot;romania gdp&quot; or &quot;peru gdp&quot; or any country, into google and look at how they all perfectly skyrocket at exactly the same time, in tandem with the USD falling and coinciding with the lift-off in this article&#x27;s chart).<p>The huge jump in household assets is the representation of the Fed inflating, which simultaneously debases the median (and below), while increasing in <i>nominal</i> terms the wealth of the top ~10% (who can hedge and dodge inflation for the most part, while worker incomes and basic savings cannot).<p>Bill Gates is worth $84 billion, right? The rich have gotten a lot richer, right? No they haven&#x27;t, they&#x27;ve merely kept up with the Fed debasing the dollar. Everyone else has gotten poorer. If you inflation adjust the rich backwards, they&#x27;re only slightly richer than they were 20 years ago. Gates is lucky if he&#x27;s worth $40 billion in 1997 terms. Whether we&#x27;re talking about housing, oil, gold, silver, platinum, copper, milk, eggs, education costs, health care costs, car costs or nearly anything else - you can roughly increase those costs by 70%-100% (at least, more in the case of edu and health care) over 20 years due to Fed inflation.",1448711818

10640833,comment,10638278,10640598,0,0,ufo,,,"The obvious &quot;killer feature&quot; of LISP is macros. One concrete example where I saw the power of macros in a problem I was working with was when I saw how clean the parser generator library in Racket was.<p>Instead of being like yacc, which uses an external DSL to define the parser, with its own syntactic conventions, the Racket parset generator is built with macros. The reason yacc has to be a metaprogram instead of just a library is because of how the semantic actions are &quot;chunks of code&quot; which you can&#x27;t really represent in C but in LISP its easy to represent &quot;chunks of unevaluated code&quot; in your program, which lets you define the parser generator as an embedded dsl implemented via macros.<p>Anyway, the reason I found this nice is that in Racket you can define your own macros to abstract over the repetitive parts of the grammar description. For example, in yacc you need to write multiple rules to describe a comma-separated list<p><pre><code>    /* Use left recursion for efficient stack use\n       and reverse at the end so the list is in\n       left-to-right order */\n    \n    arglist:\n      arglistrevdeclsx { $$ = reverse($1); }\n    ;\n    \n    arglistrev:\n      /*empty*/          { $$ = NULL; }\n    | arglistrev &#x27;,&#x27; arg { $$ = cons($2, $1); }\n    ;\n</code></pre>\nand this pattern repeats for every other list you might have in the grammar. In yacc there is no alternative but to copy and paste this boilerplate but in Racket you could define a helper macro that would let you write grammars that look a bit like this:<p><pre><code>    ;; create a non-terminal called arglist\n    ;; that is a  list of &quot;arg&quot;s, separated by commas\n    ,@(makelist arglist &#x27;,&#x27; arg)\n\n    ;; and this code can be reused:\n    ,@(makelist decllist &#x27;,&#x27; identifier)</code></pre>",1448711661

A regular gasoline-engine car can go 150 km/h, but in our cities they spend half of their time stopped, and so it&#x27;s common to get 15 km/h in real life.  And then you have to find a place to park it!  Traditional massive subways and elevated trains are better, but building them is too expensive to space them closely — so unless you&#x27;re lucky, you have to spend 20 minutes or more walking to and from them.  And then they still have to stop every 400 meters or so, because you&#x27;re sharing the car with other people.  So you still end up averaging something like 15 km/h.<p>A personal rapid transit system like skyTran can have lines spaced very closely — as closely as streets, or more closely — and can <i>actually deliver</i> close to its peak speed of 100 km/h.  You could get from any place in San Francisco to any other place in under ten minutes, instead of the hour-plus it often takes at present.<p>How important is that?  The entire benefit of a city is that you&#x27;re close to many people doing many things.  It&#x27;s being close to people that makes us put up with the pollution, noise, and undesired social interaction that come with cities.  But with our current city transport systems, you&#x27;re within 20 minutes of only about 80 square kilometers, about half a million people.  A system like skyTran effectively brings you much closer: you would have 3500 square kilometers within that same distance, about 25 million people, if density didn&#x27;t change.<p>That is, with skyTran or similar personal rapid transit systems, you could live in a place that looks like San Mateo or Redwood City, except without the cars — but enjoy <i>even more convenient access to</i> city amenities like good jobs, artisanal toast, live music, and offbeat special interest groups like Postgres, than you can get today by living in the heart of San Francisco.<p>There&#x27;s a critical mass needed to get benefits like this, and I suspect it&#x27;s close to the half-million people I mentioned above: on the order of a couple hundred kilometers of transport line, densely covering an area of several tens of square kilometers: an up-front investment on the order of a billion dollars.  But maybe skyTran&#x27;s Tel Aviv project will surprise me and transform Tel Aviv more than I expect.<p>In <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9788092"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9788092</a> I did the calculations to show that you could get substantial benefits by replacing even the elevators in a single skyscraper with a skyTran-like system.  The numbers only get better as the system gets bigger.  Scaling, far from being a problem, is the solution.  Eventually you will run into bisection bandwidth problems, but only at scales far, far larger than our current cities.  A SkyTran track transports pairs of people at about 3Hz; 200 parallel SkyTran tracks across the width of San Francisco could transport SF&#x27;s entire population from one side of the city to the other in 22 minutes (plus the transit time of 6 minutes), or 11 minutes if they shared cars.",1448709447

Do you retry your library calls when they return with EINTR?  (The answer appears to be no; I&#x27;ve seen plenty of programs exit with &quot;Interrupted system call&quot;.  That&#x27;s not an error.)<p>If you really want something to time out, there are two options.  Build into your library the ability to supply a timeout, and reliably time out; or run the operation in a separate process and kill it when the deadline is exceeded.<p>Go has a nice &quot;context&quot; idiom for carrying around cancellation and deadline information, so the chances are if you set a timeout on the context, it&#x27;s likely to be obeyed because nearly every call that performs IO accepts the context and cleanly aborts when the deadline or cancellation signal arrives (presumably propagating err back to you).  Though this is not perfect; disk writes do not appear to accept a context, which shows how careful you have to be when designing something to time out.

Why is there too little capital for people to invest in? Every time the Federal Reserve lowers the interest rate or launches QE to prevent the economy from experiencing negative growth, companies producing goods the economy would not have wanted without stimulus, stays alive a little longer. As long as these companies stay in the economy, capital tied down to produce those goods cannot be used in a more productive manner. That&#x27;s why each interest rate cycle has rates go lower and lower, each round of QE bigger and bigger, because the level of mal-investment is consistently growing higher and higher, and as a consequence yield is going lower and lower. Meanwhile through increasing debt and central bank policy there is more and more currency to invest with, in capital that is getting less and less productive because the capital is used for the wrong things. Those ghost cities and loss making subsidised farmers and iron ore mines aren&#x27;t going to help compound growth because their yield is zero or less.

Learning Lisp is not just learning a language grammar—it&#x27;s learning a habit of development that is incremental and live in a way that&#x27;s miles away from C coding and quite far from most typical styles of Python coding.<p>You open your editor and connect to Lisp. Then you spend your time interactively defining functions, changing them, defining variables and inspecting them, and so on.<p>This has consequences that you need to experience or see to understand how it plays out in practice. You tend to start coding in a different way. Paul Graham calls it bottom up programming.<p>There are also synergistic effects with features like macros which enable radical kinds of convenient code generation / DSL-building, and conditional restarts which are like exceptions but fundamentally more powerful in a way that helps greatly when doing interactive coding, the multiple dispatch object system, the online documentation system, and so on and so on.<p>Lisp is shock full of good ideas that are still absent from most other languages. But mere bullet lists aren&#x27;t convincing, like in so many other situations.<p>I wrote a web service in Lisp and just for convenience I wanted to have it incrementally recompile and reload its own source code on every request if the commit hash of the working tree had changed. This was a three line hack.<p>I also generate a memory image every time I make a deploy, which means that the server starts in a finger snap including the whole runtime for all this dynamic stuff.<p>Another advantage for me is the HyperSpec, an excellent hyperlinked reference of the whole standard language. It&#x27;s an industrial quality manual written by literate professionals and so it&#x27;s exhaustive, correct, and mostly unambiguous.<p>I also simply enjoy how Emacs with Lisp is a world-class IDE. Right now I&#x27;m mostly offline with just slow pricey 3G but I made sure to install a bunch of Lisp packages and the HyperSpec and it&#x27;s a joy to code using just Emacs and SBCL in the background. I can look up any documentation, semantic tab completion and argument list popups work perfectly since the editor is aware of all the code and the namespace rules and so on.<p>I just don&#x27;t know any other language that&#x27;s so pleasant and fun to develop with. (After learning it, of course.)<p>People call Lispers smug because they love the language more than any other, but I don&#x27;t feel smug because I didn&#x27;t come up with the thing, I just learned it and like it. I&#x27;m humbled by the engineering and quality of the tools and everything. It&#x27;s not some weird academic obsession. It just makes me happy on a daily basis.",1448708749

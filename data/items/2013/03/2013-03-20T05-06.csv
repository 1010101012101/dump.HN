When my father and his brother were getting married, they had their choice of the rings.<p>I've always wondered how other diamond rings get recycled or removed from the market.  Diamonds are forever, after all, so why doesn't the price collapse from being awash in used stones from three or four generations of dead women?",1363759166

The idea that one should view raising ""highly successful"" children as some kind of outcome they can control or influence through ""high IQ tigerness"" and cold economic analysis is humorous and sad all at once. Coupled with encouragement to not buck a pointless social tradition because it may make (shallow, deplorable) people judge you as less worthy and thus may negatively impact your future prospects of becoming more like them seems like a rather sad way to live life, but I guess we all have our own goals. The fact that after thousands of years our species is still mesmerized by shiny rocks we dug out of the ground is also odd to me, but apparently not others.",1363759058
5405867,comment,5402539,5404426,3,0,chipotle_coyote,,,"I'd argue that a lot of us in the ""Apple fan community,"" including Marco, understand that there are negatives to Apple's approach to, well, nearly everything. It's apparently very easy for people to pick up on the approval we give Apple while glossing over the criticism, I suspect in part because we don't tend to see iOS's locked-down nature as the existential crisis that, well, Hacker News readers tend to sometimes see -- and because we don't see a problem with something that they see as a deal-breaker, then, well, we must <i>never</i> say anything bad about Apple. In fact, we often do.<p>Having said that, there's at least a <i>practical</i> difference in the kind of ""monoculture"" that the iOS App Store represents and the kind of monoculture that Google Reader represented: while Apple may change the terms, it's highly unlikely they'd ever make the App Store just <i>go away.</i> I'm not sure there are any commercial products that were in the App Store and were then removed because of a change in Apple's TOS rather than for a violation that they should have been aware of when they submitted it. There are some high-profile cases of stupid rejections, to be sure, but that's not the same thing.<p>And, it's at least worth noting that a major difference there is that Apple <i>derives revenue</i> from their services. Say what you will about them, but that's a pretty good incentive to not just take their ball and go home. Google Reader didn't bring in any revenue, and that's what ultimately doomed it. (as in beer) <i>does</i> work, but not indefinitely.",1363759030

It's what is expected, it's cultural and doing feels 'wrong' and maybe even shameful. There's potential pain involved in not following the expected course of action. This is why people who go into extra debt to purchase an expensive ring, it's what it means if you don't get it.<p>If you have a couple that clouds their better judgment to meet expectations set by culture and by conforming to norms like a sheep, what's the point.<p>In my experience women (and men) want to feel special. If you are able to make your partner feel special on an ongoing basis, you have pretty good odds to create a meaningful partnership.

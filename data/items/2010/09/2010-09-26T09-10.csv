His legit domain has a warning on it because formerly it was parked (or perhaps worse, he doesn't say) and he refuses to go through any process to get this undone because he thinks the practice should be stopped. Well I think that's the main reason I use DDG sometimes, the basic index is worse than google, it's slower, but they filter out a whole lot of the SEO blogspam crap and that improves many of their results vastly (along with the bang domain specific syntax).<p>Google should do this too, or at least provide an option. I don't ever want to see a link spam, expertsexchange (yes I know scroll down, I don't care) type site again. Just like I don't ever see spam in my inbox, there is no difference to me between search engine spam and email spam. Both are cognitive overload caused by opportunists.<p>I worry about DDG's eventual revenue model though. As I still use google a fair bit and so paying for DDG would require a few more features. A DDG/stackoverflow/email/linode-like slice big enough for your irssi sessions could be rolled into a service with a focus on privacy/spamblocking and adblocking I think many would pay for.",1285494197

Bugs, from simple UI stuff to server issues, are numerous and end up adding to customer support costs, not to mention reputation.<p>Do the management understand this ? Nope, they just consider these costs to be the normal cost of doing business in this sector.

We didn't start with a copy of RSS 2.0 and XML/RPC and rewrite bits and pieces until it became Atom. The Atom community went further back than that, we examined how RSS was being used at that time, and considered how it might be used in the future, and defined several use cases or problem statements, and built up a specification format based on that. As far as I remember, we never started with the RSS 2.0 spec text.<p>The Atom Syndication fomat (the XML part) and the Atom Publishing format (the REST part) started as one and then later ran separately in parallel. Both fed requirements into each other.<p>In RSS2.0 the item element was always inside a channel, so there was always a parent context of it's meaning beyond it's namespaced definition. With Atom publishing format, we have blog entries as stand alone documents outside of a feed (so they can be created, retrieved, and updated as a single document). In that context, a top-level element name of entry is an improvement over item. And it was important to us to use the same vocabulary across both the syndication and publishing formats so the element became entry on both.<p>Atom started from a clean slate, as you point out, there was going to be no way of fixing those problems with the RSS2.0 specification without significantly breaking existing implementations and backwards compatibility, and if somehow these were avoided, the RSS2.0 specification would probably have ended up in an absolute mess.",1285492867

Because the basics of them aren't all that complicated.  CDOs, CDSs. ETFs, whatever.  None of them are particularly complex concepts.  Anyone with a CS degree has mastered concepts many times more complex.

None of these financial instruments are magic. I'm a curious layman, I get the gist of all of it.<p>And then there's people who claim their variable rate mortgage was too complicated to understand.

8149099,story,,,7,7,vajrapani666,"Ask HN: Should a CTO be expected to be the last out of the office?",,"I recently took a position as CTO at a seed stage startup. Having been in an administrative position before where I had worked 50-60+ hours a week for years, I&#x27;ve ascribed heavily to the philosophy of working smarter not harder. Ideals like &quot;Work life balance&quot;, and &quot;agile principles about sustainable development&quot;. I recently had a discussion with one of my peers at work and he remarked that he has never been at a company where the CTO was in the office less than the average engineer. He also felt that its nearly impossible to wear a manager hat and a maker hat at the same time in under 40 hours a week, quoting Paul Graham&#x27;s maker/manager schedule. He mentioned people at AirBnB and Square, Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerburg were all those who worked many long hours.<p>I feel extremely divided about this. I worked around 40 hours a week and feel like I&#x27;m taking away from my personal life and might even be nearing burnout at half the duration this particular peer is working. Measuring productivity on duration is silly to me, and I&#x27;d rather ascribe to the model of work where what counts most is prioritization and output. I realize there are major deadlines 2-3 times a year which may require sudden bursts of focus and attention, but that&#x27;s why I would push back and reduce the time I work weekly the rest of the year.<p>What is the appropriate level of work/life balance expectation for a CTO for different stage startups (pre-seed, series-a, series-b, post-acquisition) and how does that differ from the expectations on the people that a CTO might manage?<p>Is my position on work-life balance tenable? Are there examples of successful startup founders who worked smart as opposed to long hours? Did I just land in a particular culture that is incompatible with my orientation towards productivity?",1407434275
8149098,comment,8147558,8147558,13,0,Xcelerate,,,"I&#x27;ve found that, at least for me personally, quantum mechanics is much less strange when you ignore the sensationalistic, new-age mysticism quips and focuses on the actual math itself.  Let me give some examples:<p>&quot;A particle travels through all possible paths at once and only chooses one when you look at it&quot;.<p>No, a particle&#x27;s wavefunction is a vector in an abstract Hilbert space that <i>can be</i> expressed as a linear combination of basis state vectors (|Ψ> = Σ α_i|Φ_i>), and it collapses (decohers) upon measurement to one of them with probability |α_i|^2 when those basis vectors correspond to the observable&#x27;s eigenstates.<p>Or, if that&#x27;s too complicated: a wavefunction of a particle is just a function that can be represented as the weighted sum of other functions, each representing a different path that the particle can traverse.  When you measure the particle, the result corresponds to only one of those functions.<p>Perhaps the first explanation requires you to Google a little bit or pick up a math textbook if you&#x27;re not familiar with some of the terms, and perhaps the second explanation isn&#x27;t quite accurate enough, but goodness, they both make a heck of a lot more sense to me than some kind of magical &quot;everything at once&quot; phrase!<p>Another phrase, this one from the article: &quot;The rules of quantum mechanics allow — actually, require — energy (and, by E=mc2, mass) to appear &#x27;out of nowhere,&#x27; from nothing.&quot;<p>No they don&#x27;t.  HΨ = EΨ is the time-independent Schrödinger equation.  E is a constant -- a real number.  It doesn&#x27;t change.  Furthermore, the article goes on to mention the energy-time uncertainty principle, and a lot of other articles mention that energy can be &quot;borrowed&quot; to create virtual particles out of nothing.  This also isn&#x27;t true, for two reasons.  Firstly, there is no energy-time uncertainty principle, because time isn&#x27;t an operator.  You <i>can</i> derive a relationship between the two, but it&#x27;s not the same kind as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  And secondly, virtual particles are a mathematical artifact of a technique called perturbation theory (a technique used in many fields, not just QM).  Perturbation theory is just one means of solving an equation, and if you try to solve the equation with a different technique, you have no need for virtual particles.<p>I&#x27;m really glad that so many articles on quantum physics are &quot;popping into existence&quot;.  It&#x27;s a cool subject.  But I&#x27;m worried that these inaccurate little catchphrases I hear all the time are causing more headaches, confusion, and sensationalism than quantum mechanics already causes by itself alone.<p>(There are articles written by actual physicists and quantum information scientists that clarify physics concepts to non-scientists in an easily understandable, yet <i>also accurate</i> way.  Scott Aaronson and Matt Strassler are two that come to mind.)",1407434270

Kudos.<p><i>What trends are you seeing that you think should be more widely adopted?</i><p>Recruiters that behave more like community-managers / outreach-coordinators. Roles whose purpose is to engage with (and build relationships with) the developer-community as a whole, not just pluck talent ad-hoc.<p><i>What practices could promote a better dialogue between recruiters and candidates?</i><p>I find it easier to engage with a recruiter (instead of circumventing them) when they personally offer me something of value. For example: The recruiter who says &quot;if you apply online you&#x27;ll just get a phone interview, but if you go through me I&#x27;ll get you a 1-on-1 lunch with the CTO&quot;. When they start off with a clear value-proposition like that, then the headaches and bureaucracy of dealing with them are much easier to stomach.<p><i>How can we solve for some of these problems using the technology we have at hand?</i><p>I wish the application process could be a bit more standardized for the early stages (like the college / grad-school admissions process). I think it&#x27;d be an interesting thought-experiment to envision a standard-format for application packages. Imagine a package.json ~esque file that pulled in your github repos, recommendations, personal statements, etc. I wonder what else would be necessary.<p>It seems like the beginning stages of working with a recruiter are always the same (&quot;where&#x27;d you go to school?&quot;, &quot;show me some stuff you&#x27;ve done&quot;, &quot;have you heard of Big O notation?&quot;, etc etc). I wish we could just put together one standard packet, throw it up somewhere online, and let the recruiters line up interviews for us. If that would allow the recruiters to contact us with an &quot;I&#x27;ve got you an interview&quot; type of message instead of a &quot;hey let&#x27;s talk&quot; message, I&#x27;d be all for it.",1407434204

There is a difference between force and energy.  It is certainly possible to expend a small amount of energy to create a force which lasts in perpetuity.  Energy = Force x Distance, and if there is no displacement in distance, then no energy is spent by the exertion of a force.<p>Not to say that making hoverboards and flying cars is an easy engineering proposition, but that is due to the parameters of the problem, not due to any intrinsic issue with the physics of providing a force against gravity.  If people weighed a nanogram, or the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field were 1 Tesla, or the electrostatic potential between the stratosphere and the Earth was 100,000 times stronger... any one of these and we&#x27;d have had hoverboards a long time ago.

Those could be well abused by evil corporations in treacherous computing schemes, but they also have good uses. Probably not safe against TLAs, but since those chips hold the keys and do the crypto by themselves, they&#x27;re very unlikely to reveal keys even in case of browser exploits.

For a very small energy cost (P<<F * c), you can generate a magnetic field to propel yourself forward. The opposing magnet won&#x27;t move for D/c seconds, so you&#x27;re transporting momentum at a much lower cost.* , which I believe is what lukev refers as &quot;other logical possibilities&quot; -- the car is another example of this.<p>Of course, in free space magnetic field decays as 1/D^3, so eventually you will be better off spending F * c power to generate a force F. I do not disagree with &quot;The device must emit something&quot; though, since obviously momentum has to be carried by some particle, although I&#x27;m not a physicist to attest the specifics precisely.<p>* - I believe in this case the energy cost is so low because you&#x27;re &quot;storing&quot; energy in the field, energy you&#x27;re spending acts more like a trigger. As a thought experiment consider a stream of photons carrying a large amount of power P through a cross section. Now suppose your &quot;device&quot; is a mirror aligned parallel to the stream. Now for an arbitrarily small energy cost, you can align the mirror to the stream and cause the photons to produce a force P/c, &quot;triggering&quot;  the system to relocate energy.",1407432947

8148885,comment,8148345,8148345,3,0,nickhould,,,"Back in fall 2012, I attended Starter League in Chicago for their 3 months Rails bootcamp. Prior to joining the bootcamp, I had experienced with Rails through Michael Hartl tutorial and by participating in different hackathons. Taking part in SL required an appreciable upfront investment from my part: moving from Montreal to Chicago for three months, $6K tuition fee (at the time), leaving my job and not working for the duration of the program. I am extremely happy with the results and I am now working as a lead data analyst and I am coding in different languages (python, javascript) as part of my daily job. One of the upside of a great bootcamp is the streamlined learning process. Jeff Cohen,  the instructor at the time at SL, built an incredible curriculum for students, enabling deep understanding of the underlying mechanics of Rails. Furthermore, the immersion is a very interesting aspect of a bootcamp. Every day, you are surrounded by people who left their job and family to learn to code. These people want to change careers, start a tech business etc. This can be very motivating. Tips: Prior to joining a bootcamp, know exactly what you want from it. Do a bunch of tutorials, read books about coding, participate in hackathons and get to a level where you can build stuff with code. Too many people haven&#x27;t tried much before joining a bootcamp and expect to get miraculously good at coding. It&#x27;s not the case. Learning to code is hard, know what you are getting into. Also, if you expect to have a dream job on a silver plater at the end of the bootcamp, this probably won&#x27;t be the case. You&#x27;ll have to work hard for it and chances you&#x27;ll have a few more months of learnings necessary prior to a full-time gig that interests you. You can learn to code online. A bootcamp can speed up the learning process and is a great learning experience and good for networking but it is not required to learn to code. Know exactly what you want from a bootcamp.",1407432097

I credit the program&#x27;s success to their selectivity, the resources they pour into hiring instructors from the industry, and choosing to focus on JavaScript. You can read my review of HR on Quora: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Reviews-of-Hack-Reactor/review/Jake-McGuire"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Reviews-of-Hack-Reactor/review/Jake-McG...</a><p>I graduated from Yale with a history degree, then taught high school science in Mississippi, then stayed on for an extra year to lobby for charter school legalization in Mississippi. Given that background, I&#x27;d like to think I&#x27;m someone who can be thrown into new situations and learn quickly, so the bootcamp format was attractive to me. I agree that it&#x27;s not for everyone though.<p>I found Hack Reactor through the Twitter account of a graduate in their second class. I was pretty skeptical about giving $17000 to some strangers in San Francisco, but I asked a lot of questions and was impressed with their answers: they didn&#x27;t ask students to repeat sections like Dev Bootcamp, they&#x27;ve only asked students to leave for extreme failures to act appropriately towards students and staff, and the instructors (especially Marcus Phillips) have bonkers credentials. I decided to take the plunge.<p>The program is intense (6 days/week, 11 hours/day minimum) but if I was going to be unemployed for three months I would rather put all my efforts into learning than having free time. The first six weeks were instruction with two-day sprints, progressing from algorithms and data structures on to the front-end and ending with back-end (Ruby/Sinatra briefly, then a deeper dive into Node, then SQL and NoSQL databases). The second six weeks I did paid contract work through the program and worked on an open-source government transparency app using Angular and Node. When I went to interview it was great having a fully-functional Angular/Node app to discuss, and it seemed like employers felt a little better being able to inspect an actual product I had built.<p>Throughout the program we did practice interview problems every morning, several of which I got as whiteboard questions during my on-site interviews! (It&#x27;s pretty cool to tell an enterprise interviewer &quot;I&#x27;m happy to do that problem, but I just want you to know I&#x27;ve seen it before.&quot;)<p>Maybe the biggest surprise was that after the program was over, I picked up books like &quot;Cracking the Coding Interview&quot; and realized how much of it the program had already addressed without me knowing it. (I recently bought &quot;High Performance JavaScript&quot; and was genuinely surprised how much of it was just the way Hack Reactor taught me to write JavaScript.)<p>I was sort of worried the entire time I was in the program that it was all a big scam, like we&#x27;d show up one day and the office would be empty with wires dangling out of the walls and these guys had made off with $17000. I kept waiting for it to fall apart... and then it didn&#x27;t. I got four job offers within a week of graduating and the final salary was well within the band advertised by Hack Reactor. I took on about $15000 in debt to do it and I&#x27;m on track to pay it all off within a year of graduating. It was definitely worth it financially.<p>I ended up at a startup (Ziploop) using the MEAN stack and I really love it. I wanted to be humble about my post-bootcamp professional development: I know that I have a lot to learn and so I want to collaborate with supportive senior engineers -- especially about CompSci fundamentals I missed out on in college -- while also building more expertise in JavaScript that a lot of CS grads don&#x27;t have. I felt like I was able to contribute value to my employer my first week on the job without any hand-holding. We ended up hiring two more engineers from Hack Reactor as the company has grown and we&#x27;re pretty impressed with the skills new Hack Reactor graduates are leaving with.",1407431478

In fact, we spend quite a bit of time spitballing coming up with systems to overcome it (Giving your wallet some sort of &quot;reputation&quot; is common - but then requires you always spend from the same wallet, and also leaves the system open to a wholesale attack in which a common wallet app might double spend from a lot of people at the same time)<p>If someone could come up with a response to that single flaw, I think most of the others (increasing transactions per second, size of the block chain, etc...) can be overcome.",1407431416

I got the incredible chance to work at MKS as a fellow after my program was done, so I got a behind the scenes look at how it all comes together. Although they (and most schools) do a lot of vetting to find the truly driven individuals who are perfect for this format of learning, it is certainly an imperfect science and inevitably some people attend who would have been better off going it alone.<p>My advice is to start small, go to the free lessons on codeacademy, codeschool or treehouse and learn enough to build a simple front-end app (such as a number guessing game or a comment system). After that you should have a better idea as to if you want to plunk down the chunk of change to take it to the next step and attend one of these programs.<p>Although a lot of programs market themselves as career changing opportunities I would advise you to not pay this much money on your education just for a better job (some see it as a purely financial investment with their future salaries being the return.) The reason I say this is because even though you might make more money, and even if you are good at programming that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you will love doing it day in and day out. And that has more impact on you being a consistently great developer than most would think.<p>All in all This is an investment in your future self, and as such you have to ask yourself if you really want to be in front of a computer half slinging half slogging code every single day for it to pay off.",1407431407

However the Linux operating system (as in &quot;normal&quot; Linux distributions) are highly inconsistent and many have insecure-by-default configurations (like Apache/PHP/MySQL running out-of-the-box, but often with an insecure PHP and updates not installing for several more days automatically).<p>I&#x27;d say that the statement that Windows Server is more secure than Linux (operating system) is likely more true than it is false. But frankly a lot of people in the Linux space are so arrogant that they don&#x27;t really take security as seriously as they could. Even with mounting reports of infected Linux servers spreading malware, spam, or being used to launch DDoS attacks.<p>Are Linux servers as big of a threat as insecure Windows clients? No. No they&#x27;re not. But that is largely a numbers game, there are maybe 150+ Windows clients for every 1 Linux server. But if we&#x27;re talking server Vs. server, Linux would likely be the number #1 most commonly infected in 2014.",1407431318

Coding schools are usually worth it if you are<p>1. Motivated enough to make it work - There will be a lot of long hours and toil. You will be trying to cram in a 4 year degree in a 3 month course so be prepared.<p>2. Question the logic - Programming languages came from humans and not the other way around. So there will be a distinct train of thought to how a system works. Never shy away from asking this. Never shy away from asking the seemingly dumb questions. You will be much more comfortable with a scenario if you know the mechanics of how something works<p>3. Focus on system design instead of UI - UI and UX experience correlates strongly with experience. System design experience (how do i code this particular component?, Design patterns etc) is contingent on you having strong fundamentals. So focus on that.

Participating libraries would ship a book to IA/OL, who would then scan it and pack away the original so no one could have access to it. IA/OL uses Adobe DRM software to make a copy of the work available digitally, either directly or through its partner libraries, though to only one person at a time. I&#x27;ve written about this process within the larger context of ebooks and DRM here: <a href=""http://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2012/the-ebook-cargo-cult/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2012/the-ebook-ca...</a><p>As I understand it, one of the precedents for Open Library&#x27;s process was an allowance made for transitioning from legacy to supported platforms. If a library had an important work on a Betamax tape, and no one had Betamax players, it would be allowed to transfer that information to a VHS tape or a DVD or some other format that people could use, provided the library makes the original unavailable (IIRC, the library may even be expected to destroy the original), and only circulate the newly formatted copy with the restrictions that applied to the previous copy.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in this topic and aren&#x27;t a lawyer, I recommend Complete Copyright[1] by the American Library Association&#x27;s Carrie Russell, along with anything by Mary Minnow[2].<p>[0] <a href=""http://openlibrary.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openlibrary.org/</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.alastore.ala.org/detail.aspx?ID=2260"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alastore.ala.org/detail.aspx?ID=2260</a> (also available at Amazon, etc.)\n[2] <a href=""http://blog.librarylaw.com/librarylaw/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.librarylaw.com/librarylaw/</a>",1400270361

7757560,comment,7757066,7757443,1,0,Jemaclus,,,"Right, so I agree with you that it&#x27;s cool. What I&#x27;m getting at though is... is it necessary? Wouldn&#x27;t all of your vacation photos be roughly in the same spot, since you took them at the same time and presumably put them in the same album? (The dog example is more compelling, but you get my point.)<p>Is this a problem <i>worth solving</i>? It just seems to me like it&#x27;s more of a solution in search of a problem -- and photo management is largely a very solved problem. The number of people who have so many photos that they can&#x27;t sort through them quickly is probably really low. The entities that would get the most out of this kind of technology are places like Facebook and Google.<p>Put another way: is releasing a photo management app into a market flooded with photo organization apps worth the time, money, and effort put into it? Are there other equally cool problems out there that are actually problems that need to be solved in markets that are not saturated at all?<p>My go-to example of something like this is something I heard at SF Nerd Nite (<a href=""http://sf.nerdnite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sf.nerdnite.com</a>) where one non-profit is using drones to help farmers manage their huge tracts of land. That sounds like a really cool solution to a startlingly common problem in that industry. Right now, farmers tend to have to go out in person and spot-check parts of their fields, but there&#x27;s no way for them to get a detailed look at <i>everything</i> really fast... that&#x27;s where drones come in. They fly over, snap hi-res photos of the fields, and then bring them up on the computer screen -- all while the farmer is making coffee and eating breakfast.<p>So I mean -- and again just from a thinking out loud standpoint, because I totally get how cool Photomatic is from an image processing standpoint -- what I&#x27;m trying to get at is... does the world need yet another photo organizing app? Is <i>this</i> really what we think the world (or even the tech industry, or even the mobile app industry) needs?<p>Maybe it is. Maybe not.<p>I understand how this is cool and how it could be useful, though, and I totally agree that it would be great if someone besides Google/FB could develop something like this... and then hold out and not get bought by those companies.<p>Finally, just in case it&#x27;s not 100% clear, I&#x27;m not picking on Photomatic. It really does look very well done and I&#x27;m definitely impressed with the tech behind it. I&#x27;m really thinking more along the lines of most of the stuff I see on Show HN. The vast majority of the apps on Show HN are what I call &quot;first-world solutions.&quot; That is, they&#x27;re for problems that I don&#x27;t really think are epic problems. Yeah, okay, so maybe we can organize photos a bit better, or maybe the to-do app really is the worst way to manage something, or maybe there just isn&#x27;t a perfect invoicing system out there.<p>But at the end of the day, millions upon millions of people out there manage their photos just fine, get things done just fine, and invoice customers just fine without a shiny new app. So, other than as a learning exercise or portfolio piece, why bother? Why not invest that time and money and energy into solving something that truly stymies people, inhibits progress, and prevents mankind from reaching ever greater heights? (Which, incidentally, would double as both a learning exercise and a portfolio piece, while also &quot;saving the world&quot;.)<p>Anyway, those are my thoughts. Hope I don&#x27;t offend too many people.<p>P.S. Thanks for a serious answer. :)",1400269959

Sometimes it does make it a challenge though because there just aren&#x27;t that many people out there with the necessary skill and experience, especially in more specialized areas, so you wind up having to choose between someone with a fantastic attitude but limited skill and a very skilled tradesperson that takes a little more hands-on management (in the sense that you have to help them develop more empathy, to not quarrel, to communicate better with colleagues, etc).<p>It&#x27;s definitely a fine line.

We decided to keep living as simply even though we were lucky enough to both get jobs not long after graduating. We read all the requirements and prepayment guidelines and followed them to the letter which helped knock the time down tremendously. When we got within a couple thousand, my in-laws paid off the rest with a no-interest loan that they made to us.<p>Not everyone has those circumstances, I know, but the biggest realization was if we would be okay with living well below our means for a few years, we would be better off in the end.

Mainly not to discuss the matter, but to push their agenda in the matter.<p>This drives the signal:noise ratio in the wrong direction and, if tolerated, degrades the forum as a whole.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that there isn&#x27;t space for such discussions, but this is not the format for such discussion and only bad can come of it.

10139235,comment,10126805,10130570,0,0,pron,,,"What I mean by that is the philosophy that verification should be based on explicit types in the original program source. This intricately ties the process of authoring software with that of verifying it. The result is needlessly constraining both the developer and the verifier. It only lets you (easily) write code within what it can prove, and only lets you prove properties that can be expressed by the types that you use.<p>Other approaches say, we&#x27;ll let people write code however they feel most comfortable doing (more or less), using types whose expressivity is defined not by the limits of the verifier but <i>only</i> by various concerns over language complexity, mental overhead, performance and teamwork, while we let the verifier prove whatever types it can. If it proves that the variable x is of type &quot;an integer which is always equal to the current time in seconds modulo seven, except on Saturdays when it&#x27;s always zero&quot;, then that&#x27;s great!",1440827962

The article alludes they were pretty bad, when elevator operators went on strike the city was badly affected apparently. I can tell you in the US like 20-30 people die each year in elevators, it&#x27;s pretty minor given the billions of trips but I think we can easily imagine elevators were not quite as reliable 100 years ago when the automatic elevator existed, and that the accident rate was quite a lot higher.",1440827401

10139209,comment,10136014,10136453,0,0,colin_mccabe,,,"I think you are misunderstanding how natural selection works.  You seem to be implying that there is some guiding hand behind the evolution of each species.  In fact, if longer life were an advantage for an individual member of any species, the gene pool would gradually shift towards longer life.  Some species do indeed have extremely long lives-- some trees live for thousands of years, and some whales and turtles can live and even reproduce for more than a hundred years.<p>Instead, life length is a tradeoff that is made at the individual level.  A longer life means more opportunities to reproduce (or help your offspring), but it also means that you have to set a higher limit for the number of divisions each cell can make, which can decrease cancer resistance.  A slower metabolism will produce fewer harmful byproducts, but give you less energy than a fast-burning metabolism.  And so on.<p>Longer life makes more sense for more intelligent organisms, since they can be more effective when they&#x27;re older due to what they have learned.  Often, they need teach the young, which can have relatively long gestation times.  But an organism&#x27;s lifespan is always going to be oriented around its reproductive cycle.<p>With all that being said, humans are very clever and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if ways were found around human mortality eventually.  I can&#x27;t help thinking of all the &quot;humans were never meant to fly&quot; arguments that people used to pooh-pooh heavier than air flight in the old days.  There&#x27;s no fundamental reason why life extension couldn&#x27;t be done except time and effort.  But I am not as optimistic as Kurzweil about the timeframe (who is?)",1440827304

10139198,comment,10138275,10139110,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"This so hard, I mentioned this in a post just last week. There&#x27;s a 9/11 every month on US roads, yet we leave the number 1 safety improvement (computerized traffic) we could make to probably eradicate 90% to private business: pushing driverless cars. Now of course at the end of the day this change has to be driven by businesses, but government can and should help: R&D and prototyping (like a ton of big inventions, e.g. the internet) could and should be funded to a very large extent by the government. Commercialization should be entirely left to businesses, but even here governments can use regulation to introduce new safety standards to inform drivers of the safest options for driving at the very least. And you could even go so far as to employ a model akin to that of many governments which increase taxes on fuel inefficient cars (e.g. SUVs) and decrease them on fuel efficient cars as an environmental measure, but then apply the same on the basis of safety (driverless cars, if they score well on safety which they should over time, being cheaper). You can argue that such a move is big government, you can also argue that&#x27;s simply the government forcing the market to price in externalities (purely from a financial perspective, road death and injury increasing costs of healthcare on society, decreasing productivity, but also things like congestion and fuel efficiency can be priced in, which driverless cars should do better in) that currently are ignored. It&#x27;d still be entirely market driven, but the market reflects reality better. Once it picks up individual states could choose to make certain sections of roads (e.g. one lane) or sections of their city, entirely driverless car only at certain hours of the day, to accelerate the process. And once you go driverless you&#x27;ll essentially open up what &#x27;public transportation&#x27; really means. In a sharing economy of vehicles which need no driver, anyone&#x27;s car essentially becomes a tiny bus-service. I&#x27;d expect the cost of transportation to drop quite significantly.",1440826855

It does everything for you like that (shader graphics, collision detection, vector math, etc).

When people ask me how it can be so cheap, I always joke it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a $15 ride but you&#x27;re splitting it with a venture capitalist.<p>Competition to reduce prices by increasing efficiency is great for the consumer. Competition to increase market share by offering things at below market value by burning VC money or taking advantage of drivers is fine in the short run, but will have long term problems.[1] The other shoe has to drop, and it will either look like a huge price increase to make these companies profitable or investors losing a bunch of money.<p>[1] see Groupon et al.",1426172257

You&#x27;d save a tiny amount on his monthly travel (I don&#x27;t know what his costs are, but I used to stay in Palo Alto for weeks at a time in my last job, and it should be doable for him to travel to, and stay in, San Jose for a week for <$1k/month), in return for a as much or more in hosting costs unless you can find someone willing to give him free space.<p>That&#x27;s assuming you can find a nearby suitable data centre.<p>> I wonder what prevents that hardware from working from, say, a desk in the house of the maintainer<p>Nothing.

You number them, sit them down behind a visual barrier, and listen to each of them play the same piece of music.  Then you pick the number that played it the best and hire that person.<p>Pulling back from that metaphor a bit, software professionals don&#x27;t play just one instrument, or one genre of music.  We know multiple high level languages, use different framework tools, use different design patterns, follow different processes, and the only thing we really all have in common is the ability to take a large, human-sized task and break it down into tiny, specific instructions simple enough for a stupid electronic machine to carry out--the paths between origin and destination being uncountably varied, and the ones chosen being largely a matter of arbitrary choices or aesthetic preferences.<p>If you won&#x27;t consider anyone that does not have a public portfolio, you are inviting the obvious countermeasure of creating a sham portfolio just to jump through your hoop.

Here&#x27;s my layman&#x27;s understanding: you can deduct expenses from capital gains prior to taxing them but they have to have a certain level of connection with the gains, and it is possible that &quot;general administrative expenses of our operation&quot; don&#x27;t have that level of connection.  Shuffling those expenses into the accelerator makes them clearly deductible against the accelerator&#x27;s ordinary income, since the accelerator looks like any money-comes-in-money-goes-out IT business.  The program fee is clearly revenue.  Their rent is clearly an expense.  If revenues equal expenses than their revenues are taxed at, effectively, 0%.<p>&quot;Tax optimization on $25k doesn&#x27;t make sense&quot; would be a sensible objection until you remember that 500 Startups operates at industrial scale and that this is suddenly $3 million in revenue a year.<p>n.b. 500 Startups would, eventually, pay whatever the normal capital gains taxes are on the carry (and/or ordinary income tax if the law is ever changed to make it less favorable), in accordance with the standard treatment of investments under US tax law.  It&#x27;s not an avoidance strategy, it is a temporal optimization strategy.<p>Edit to add: Above explanation is purely &quot;My best understanding of the matter as someone who had no hand in putting this together.&quot; based on my inexpert understanding of standard US principles of taxation and their public statements about it.",1426170983

The truth is that actually good people in those positions are working very hard and that they have basically no resources available nor dedicated to &quot;make it look good.&quot; The number of cycles that consumer-oriented start-ups put towards design is roughly similar to what enterprises would spend on compliance and security. Both sides are motivated by completely different business drivers - start-ups and consumer companies need design to drive customer acquisition, and enterprises tend to require sales teams to be able to engage their enterprise customers. This dramatically changes the output obviously.<p>Only the top-performing enterprise vendors that have been able to get the funding necessary to meet compliance issues AND design have a remote chance of doing decent UI.<p>Also, another factor to consider is that most enterprise software these days by the typical vendors are acquisitions, so that software has already been around for roughly... 5 years or so. After they&#x27;re rebranded, it&#x27;s been another 2 years and the original engineers and designers have left after displeasure with their new masters.

We have mainly done that for white dudes with reasonable levels of social capital. I&#x27;d like to do it for everybody.<p>The feeling of being a visibly different minority in a crowd can be unsettling. (As a white guy I experience it rarely, but when it happens, I notice the difference acutely.) This is true regardless of actual risk. But women are currently at higher risk of all sorts of predatory behavior: creeps, stalkers, harassers, sexual assaulters, rapists. I personally expect that a sexualized environment will increase those risks. But even if they don&#x27;t, suddenly having your context shifted from, &quot;professional who likes to code thinking about code&quot; to &quot;fuckable prey for the predators in the crowd around you&quot; is problematic.<p>Our choices are either to give up and have those people mainly stay away or to work on creating a safe space so that everybody can attend. There is no middle path here. Pycon explicitly chose the latter.<p>Does this exclude ideas? I guess, in a sad and limited sense of the term &quot;ideas&quot;. Pycon&#x27;s limited the acceptable content thusly: &quot;All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.&quot;<p>Does this mean you can&#x27;t talk about your favorite masturbation techniques on stage? Sure. But seriously, why would you? What sort of incredible idea exchange are we missing out on here by saying that a Python conference has to be about Python? If you also want to talk about sex, there are conferences about that. There&#x27;s even a well-established conference about sex and technology. [1]<p>What you&#x27;re refusing to connect here is what happened to Adria before and after she posted a tweet about a Code of Conduct violation. She was harassed and threatened; her employer was attacked, harming their business. These are all crimes, and they&#x27;re crimes for a reason. You might not see the connection, but to me (and I&#x27;m sure to any woman in tech) it&#x27;s pretty obvious: men willing to attack women are part of the tech community. They could be anybody. [2]<p>She surely knew that there could well be predators in that crowd. And the moment the context is sexualized is the moment that she has to start paying attention to that rather than the content. This is true for anybody, but it is especially true for people who have been traumatized in the past.

9190982,comment,9188746,9190308,0,0,vidarh,,,"> I wouldn&#x27;t call $84k/year &quot;well below&quot; market.<p>You might not call it that, but for someone in devops with that length of experience, it&#x27;s  <50% of market value.<p>> Especially considering that the project isn&#x27;t under heavy development.<p>According to the article, he spends ca. 100 hours a week on the project. It may not be under heavy development, but there&#x27;s a constant stream of both development work and ops work.<p>> Also, I have to echo what other comments have said... he seems to be spending it oddly.<p>That is only relevant if you want to account for part of the $7000 as something other than salary, in which case he&#x27;s even more woefully underpaid. Which he is anyway, given that he&#x27;s also spending on some of the hosting and replacement parts out of his own pocket. Even so, his arrangement is not at all unusual at his level - I used to work for someone whose previous job involved flying from California to D.C. once a week for a couple of days. The cost of a travel arrangement like that is peanuts compared to his value. Especially given there&#x27;s no established office or other admin costs.<p>> 1) Move him and his family closer to the data center (Perhaps difficult)<p>Why do you think he&#x27;d want to move for a job that&#x27;s so underpaid, to one of the highest living cost regions in the world? Chances are good this would increase his monthly outgoings by more than he&#x27;d save on travel and board.<p>> 2) Move the servers to a data center that&#x27;s closer to his home (Not as difficult)<p>Did you miss the part where isc.org that hosts the bulk of the server farm <i>does not charge</i> for it? If you can find someone with sufficiently low latency connection to major interchange points near him that are willing to host the bulk of the servers for free, I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;d be ecstatic to hear about it. If not, it&#x27;d almost certainly cost more than it&#x27;d save. It&#x27;d also represent a major risk to key internet infrastructure.<p>> 3) He could start using VMs like the rest of the world...<p>For stratum 1 servers? You clearly don&#x27;t understand what it is he&#x27;s doing. Stratum 1 servers needs a reliable physical connection  to a reliable time source (such as a GPS receiver). He needs dedicated hardware. Try to get data center employees to properly handle non-standard hardware like that. I dare you.<p>> 4) Fire him and find someone else who would like a $7k/month stipend to do bugfixes (Fairly easy)<p>Good luck with that. Pretty much anyone prepared to take on that job for $7k/month <i>including</i> covering server costs and hardware repairs, is going to be woefully underqualified. In any case, if the situation doesn&#x27;t improve, we&#x27;ll find out soon given that he set an April deadline before he&#x27;ll look for other things to do.<p>EDIT: Also note the part where it is unclear whether the $7k grant will even continue after April.",1426170443

However, if you <i>do</i> want to learn more math beyond calculus and linear algebra, then a thorough understanding of calculus is absolutely a prerequisite and you honestly probably haven&#x27;t learned it well enough taking the typical sequence of classes.<p>For example, I&#x27;m currently studying probability theory at a fairly rigorous level (building up from measure theory) and my relative lack of skill with calculus is the main stumbling block. And I was recently talking with one of my\nprofessors who said that the biggest obstacle he sees students facing in trying to understand advanced mathematics isn&#x27;t the difficulty of the math itself, but in their lack of mastery of the fundamental calculations that are necessary to follow the ideas and to come up with them on your own. Fluency with calculus is an enormous part of this. That said, I agree with the point, which is that for most students linear algebra is more useful.<p>Actually, I might go a bit farther and say that most students don&#x27;t need to learn much math at all, at least in the way it is taught. Math is pretty poorly taught for a subject that is actually quite interesting once you start to understand it better (part of the problem is that in order to get to the interesting parts you need to first master all the boring stuff), and most people won&#x27;t use any nontrivial math in their future lives.",1426169432

Once I move in town, I won&#x27;t be able to just hop in my vehicle and crank it up. I have to get out of the parking deck, get out onto the highway if I don&#x27;t want to be a douche about it.

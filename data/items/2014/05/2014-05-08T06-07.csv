If there are particles of the energy described in the original link, there are many more particles of lower energies also hitting the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, including energies accessible at the LHC. And none of these resulted in the Earth&#x27;s destruction.<p>The same logic applies to the argument that any black-holes or otherwise dangerous particles would simply zip by the Earth (stated in a sibling comment to yours). Particles of slightly lower momenta come in higher numbers, so these would produce the dangerous particle, but not retain enough momentum to escape. Since the Earth has not been destroyed, there are no particles produced at low enough energies for us to destroy ourselves.",1399532156

The way it will work with the Falcon Heavy (when that much payload capacity is desired) is that the 3 engines on each side in the center booster will each feed from the nearest outer cores during liftoff. When those cores are empty the feed will be stopped, those 6 engines will shut down, the outer cores will separate, and then the 6 engines will come online again fueled by the center core. It&#x27;s mostly just valve work, to be honest. Also, even if it doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s not a huge deal long term. It means that we&#x27;ll be deprived of the highest payload capacities for an expendable Falcon Heavy but we&#x27;ll still have a fairly high (20+ tonne to LEO) capacity booster in a reusable configuration, which will probably be more impactful in the long run than the expendable configuration.",1399530286

7714148,comment,7702762,7702762,1,0,Ologn,,,"Some people here are talking about you studying CS topics on your own. So let&#x27;s say in August you start spending nine hours a week studying some topic - say, theory of computation.  You spend nine hours a week studying it from August to December.<p>Well, if you are taking one class a semester at your local public university this fall, you would be spending three hours a week in class to do this.<p>You&#x27;re going to have to spend 9 hours a week from August to December studying, say, theory of computation, in order to get a BSCS level grasp of it.  Why not spend <i>12</i> hours a week doing it, and actually getting a BSCS in the process?  You&#x27;ll also get a professor you can ask questions of during class, after class, during office hours, and probably other times.  There are other benefits of going to school as well.<p>One of the biggest problems if you don&#x27;t have a BSCS, is you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know.  If you don&#x27;t understand how floating point numbers are stored in memory, at least you know you can always look into that.  The real problem is when you don&#x27;t pursue a solution because you don&#x27;t even know it exists.<p>I tried to write a multi-threaded C program with changing state before I took a class in mutual exclusion.  The results weren&#x27;t pretty.  After the class, I had to deal with another mutual exclusion problem - a somewhat tough Java mutual exclusion problem in some production code.  I was able to fix it fairly quickly.  When you&#x27;re writing code and realized you need some feature, often it&#x27;s simple.  When a program progresses to where you need threading and mutual exclusion - most people don&#x27;t stop what they&#x27;re doing and spend a few weeks studying mutual exclusion like they would have in college.  They just plow through it which is why people complain about bad threading in code so much.  A BSCS gives you that background you were always lacking.<p>Also, the tendency for someone doing this on their own is not to spend four months study calculus, then four more studying calculus, then four more studying calculus, then four more studying discrete math, then four more studying theory of computation, and THEN studying C++ for four months.  Usually people on their own are just going to skip the more theoretical stuff and jump right into the immediately practical stuff - straight to C++.  But then they will never have the background required - they never took graph theory, so data structures such as directed acyclic graphs are hard to understand.<p>There&#x27;s always something to learn, but a BSCS gives you a good foundation and background to build off of.  People here are saying you can do the three years of study to cover a BSCS education on your own.  Which you can.  So why not actually spend four years - the one hour in class for the typical three hours of homework.  Do four years instead of three and get the actual BSCS.  You can go at night, weekends, online (but don&#x27;t do a scam one) etc.  Many professors are alright, a few are very good and only one where I went was a poor teacher.",1399529899
7714147,comment,7712297,7713753,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"So, there are two basic approaches you can make to this:<p>1. Delegate moderation powers only to a select group of individuals who know and will uphold the site&#x27;s standards.  Effectively:  and editorial board.<p>2. Allow all users to moderate.  But score each on how well the result of their moderation adheres to a specified goal -- that is, for a given submission, was it 1) appropriate to the site and 2) did it create high-level engagement?  Users might correlate positively or negatively, strongly or weakly.  That is:  some people will vote up content that&#x27;s not desirable, and downvote content that is.  Others simply can&#x27;t tell ass from teakettle.  In the first case, you simply reverse the sign, in the second, you set a low correlation value.  And of course, those who are good and accurate predictors get a higher correlation value.<p>With the 2nd approach, everyone&#x27;s &quot;vote&quot; counts, though it may not be as they expected.  You&#x27;ve also got to re-normalize moderation against a target goal.<p>It&#x27;s more computationally intensive, but I think it might actually be a better way of doing things.",1399529875

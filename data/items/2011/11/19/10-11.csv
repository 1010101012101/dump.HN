3255050,comment,3252753,3252956,1,0,calyth,,,"I don't agree with Gruber's gripe about Gladwell's view of Steve Jobs being a tweaker.<p>It's easy to point out that no one is a visionary if a visionary has to come up with something completely fresh. And I agree with Gruber on that front.<p>Yet Gruber, and Jeff Atwood on a tweet, really had a problem with tweaker.<p>Casting that visionary / innovator argument aside, Gladwell rightly pointed out that Jobs improved on an existing object, and took it to the next level. Macintosh stemmed from Xerox, iPod stemmed from the existing music players, iPhone stemmed from the BlackBerry and Treos at the time. But he created new products that are truly leaps forward from what they were.<p>And he did it iteratively. Yet people see the word tweaker and think that was a put down.<p>To me, Gladwell's piece serves a good reminder to people that without Jobs, computers, music players and phones existed. Jobs created the computers, music players, and phones that we know it today. Drawing the percentage of change needed to call Jobs an innovator or a tweaker is like defining how many whiskers would have to be on a guy's face to call it a beard.",1321699022

But I do think that it is a good example in that it is simple and effective and I hope people can easily see what I mean when given this example. Of course the best design example would be the wheel, but it is so good/great/awesome that most people can't see how amazing it is and how it shows the power of abstraction of the human mind, which is in big part what design is about (whether it is for objects or programming or whatever). This is because the best ideas seems natural and obvious after someone had them and said it. This is why I think this Clip thing is a good example, it's much more simple and way less obvious than the wheel.<p>About the price, I mainly agree with you on that, but it was not my point.",1321698931

A new concept of widgets has to be introduced in browsers. Kindof like IE8's ""web-snippets"" but with more power and some sandboxed interface between the widget and the current website. For power users and trusted widgets you should be able to disable the barriers completely to get the same functionality as today, but as opposed to today, this should require a user warning at least on bookmarklet install.",1321698441

Certainly Germany and wider Europe are not made up of people who have an entirely homogenous attitude towards sexuality. And as you would of course know, it's not like you can just walk naked through any street in Berlin without causing a fuss. But having lived in Germany, I'm sure you understand the subtle difference in the European attitude that I'm trying to illustrate.<p>I think you're putting the horse before the cart. I'm pretty sceptical that anyone is 'fundamentally wired' any differently from anyone else. We're all products of our society and even if a certain set of social conventions are deeply baked into the history of a particular culture, that shouldn't mean that said social conventions should be mistaken for some form of innate attribute or that they cannot be re-examined if they are found to be detrimental. I'm not implying that this is necessarily what you meant, I'm just pointing out that its a slippery slope from 'fundamentally wired for X' to 'can't change X'.",1321698131

You're going to have to have the build tools installed for any substantial web project you work on, and it's going to be less, sass, uglifyjs, closure, yuicompressor, the one I use that you've never heard of, or something else.  Exactly which tools used is not particularly important.<p>And if you look at the Closure Stylesheets docs, it takes about 10 seconds (literally) to get it, if you're already familiar with similar systems.  And if you're not familiar with them, you're riding the learning curve no matter what system you choose.<p>Finally, as to the observation, the argument is extremely compelling if you are deciding which toolset to use on your new project.  Should I use Closure + Sass?  Or should I use Closure?  What do Less and Sass bring to the table that Closure does not?<p>(I'm not badmouthing these fine projects, and would not fault people for using any of them.)",1321697895

Keep in mind, Jobs wanted Walter Isaacson to write his biography. Don't blame the author. Blame Jobs. You all so easily give him credit when he stands on the shoulders of giants. This seems like a logical leap. Give him credit for this too because it was actually genius.<p>More seriously, what points make the biography flawed or a mess? A biography isn't meant to be enjoyed. Its meant to inform the reader. Jobs defined technology but more than just technology defined him. The point was to capture that.<p>I guess most of you truly are shallow. You appreciated the icon of Steve Jobs. Jobs as the man that brought you computing power to your desk, your lap and your hand. Most of you look up to him. Followed him. Admired him. Felt your work inspired by him. But you all failed to understand his final stroke of genius. He wanted to be remember beyond a set of products.<p>Jobs understood biography.

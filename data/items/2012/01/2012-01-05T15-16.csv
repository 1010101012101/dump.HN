If you are going to choose between two sales guys, one who pulls in $10 deals and another who pulls in million-dollar deals, who are you going to choose? OK, now that you've chosen the latter, how much are you going to pay him? Since there's no simple way to come up with an arbitrary worth, say you settle on a nice big offer for him. What if he stops producing stellar numbers (due to personal deficiencies or market forces)? Do you fire him or reduce his pay? Doing either is sure to infuriate him if external forces are at play, so the only alternative is a merit-based commission system.<p>I'm not saying it's right for companies who only pay sales commissions and don't reward coders--there absolutely should be profit sharing and bonuses for programmers with measurable contributions to the company--but this process is in place simply because sales' efforts are infinitely easier to quantify and reward (from a profitability standpoint) than are programming efforts.",1325778611

The couch.io to CouchBase transition was poorly communicated, so I'm glad Damien's made such a clear statement of intent. Clearly I'm going to have to stick with Apache CouchDB for now. I was interested in moving to CouchBase, but that's surprisingly difficult:<p>1. There's no easy transition for my data. I thought I could just install CouchBase and replicate from my existing CouchDB -- nope, can't be done. Huh? But why...<p>2. It's partly because CouchBase drops the CouchDB REST API. Which also means, none of my existing code works with it. So I guess it's no big deal that my data won't move over, because my app won't be able to retrieve it anyway.<p>Because there's no easy transition, they've created a situation where anyone considering a move to CouchBase is just as likely to re-evaluate all of the other document (or k/v) stores.",1325778170

But it's much worse than that.<p>Even if you only need to access 2GB (or you had fixed the Java memory mapping code) you still have a .getDoucle() or .putDouble() call for every access; and that's actually a virtual call (and as far as I can tell, even though I only ever used one kind of memory channel, the JVM wouldn't inline it -- although I can't tell for sure, because the JVM also sucks at introspection).<p>I had real computational code in C that needed to be translated to Java.<p>First attempt (no memory mapping, converting C structs to Java objects) failed miserably because my structs were 32 bytes each, and the object overhead was 24 or 32 (don't remember), which took me beyond physical memory (using virtual memory caused a slowdown of ~1000).<p>2nd attempt, I switched to memory mapped arrays -- much better, only ~15 times slower. But I also had to write my own sort, because Array.sort() or whatever it was called was allocating 48 bytes for each 4 byte int to sort (wtf?), blowing memory usage up again.<p>That's a cost people using Hadoop pay all the time -- which kind of surprises me how popular it is.

Been only doing this since last December, but I am loving it and will have a hard time going back to commuting.<p>Lots of people with prior telecommuting experience warned me about issues like isolation, putting on weight (because of proximity to food) and lack of discipline. Now after telecommuting, I feel that I have none of these issues. I have friends that I play tennis with or meet up occasionally for drinks, and I feel that more than makes up for the lack of social interaction. Regarding food, I used to eat out when I commuted so now I have more control over what I eat being at home. Lack of discipline is a problem only when you see it as a lack of discipline. I have moments when I want to stop work and read HN, do a tutorial etc. This actually helps me getting back to work in an hour or two with fresher focus on the problem.<p>All in all, I believe remote work is the future.

That's the first thing everyone should look for when motivating themselves, finding an end goal. This is essentially a long term goal, not short term ones. It must be a single goal, not a set of goals, else you will loose focus. I can hear you thinking already, ""but I want to do so much"", but that's the beauty of this end goal, it can be broad enough to cover all your dreams. This is the hardest question to answer (""what's my purpose in this life?""), took me 15 years (from the day I started to think about this, when I was a kid) to decide on what I wanted to do with my life, but the more life experience you have, the easier it is to decide upon it. When deciding on this, make sure you don't confuse the end with the means to reach it, so don't choose a specific goal such as become a doctor, or become the president of your country. Do you want to be a doctor, or do you want to actually save lives? Do you want to be the president, or do you want to build a better country/world? A tip that can help you with not confusing the end with the means is: state your end goal in 3 words or less. I can state mine in 2.<p>The second characteristic motivated people have is confidence. They are usually pretty confident they can reach their end goal. This is one of the reasons people have very different goals. Many would say that making the world better is a good goal, but how many would say they got the confidence to do it? If you don't have the confidence, build it. A little example from my own experience: when a kid I was scared of skating down a big half-pipe from a park we used to go to. At that time, my goal was quite simple, have fun and skate better than my friends, but I didn't really have the confidence to accept the challenge of skating down that huge half-pipe. I built up my confidence by going down smaller ones (even broke an arm when doing that, but it didn't stop me, I learned from my mistake and started using gloves) until one day I was confident enough to try going down the large one, and so I did. That's how you build confidence.<p>Lastly, after choosing your goals and building the confidence to do it, you need to decide on what way to take. For any goal, there are a wide choice of ways you can take to move towards them. Some ways are easier than others, some are more interesting, some are very challenging. This is what will define your short and mid term goals. Think of them as stepping stones so you can reach the end goal. Let's go back to one of our examples, you want to save lives. You can be a doctor and save lives, you can be a scientist, finding cures to diseases in a lab and save lives, you can be a fireman and save lives or even be an investor in nanotechnology labs and save lives. Which way is more appealing to you? Let's continue, you decided that by being a doctor you will save lives. First of all, what kind of doctor do you want to be? A cardiologist? A neurosurgeon? An E.R. doctor? Well, do you need to make that decision now? Not really, you can choose it while you are at college, so let's move on. Oh, right, you must enter college and graduate before becoming a doctor. Uhm, do you want to enter the best college you can? Damn, we need to study for the SAT then (I ain't American, not really sure how college admissions really work). Anyway, this is how you decide on the way. You state your end goal and work backwards from the longest term goal to the shortest one. That's how you decide on what means you will use to reach your end goal.<p>Anyway, after deciding on all that, that's how you will be motivated to study for that algebra exam, or to pay attention at that physics class from that boring teacher at 6pm on a Friday. A couple important notes, I highly suggest you to never share your end goal with your peers. This usually undermines your confidence, and therefor, your motivation. Secondly, your goal, once defined shouldn't change. If it changes, it just mean you haven't found yours yet. What can change, and should change (due to changes in environment) are the means you choose to take. The means can always change, but they should always be moving you towards the end. An example, your country enters in war. This is highly disruptive to everyone's lives and this will very likely affect on the means you will choose to reach your goal, but shouldn't change your end goal.",1325777101

Normally, these are sent to the client separately and merged in the graphics card: the surface image is texture mapped onto the terrain, and then the building data is drawn separately on top. Special routines are used to draw trees (e.g. billboards).<p>What Nokia have done here is to merge everything - terrain, surface image, buildings and trees - into the same model. They're still using the classic chunked level of detail approach, just with more complex models, which the graphics card handles with ease.<p>This requires more work on the server side to prepare the data, but once it is done it is <i>really</i> fast for the client. The main disadvantage is that the data ends up being very static - you can't move objects around, for example.<p>P.S.

For example, a recruiter offers the company a skilled, vetted employee, with the promise of paying their salary for the first year. If the company doesn't like them, lay off the worker, risk free. If they like the employee, the pay back the recruiter twice the first year's salary. I think paying twice first year's salary is a pretty good deal for eliminating a huge portion of risk from the hiring process.

Most good and bad things are in here, some already mentioned. So here goes the good:<p>- differences in culture that allow you to communicate your ideas and gain trust faster than in a local company (such situations: adoption of agile methodologies are way behind in local companies still stuck with waterfall when compared to US ones);
- better pay compared to local deals;
- work with international teams connects you to the pulse of a market you would otherwise only ""observe"" from a distance and maybe think the people running those sites/businesses have an extra ""something"";<p>... and bad:
- (depending on your location and legislation) all overseas employers I worked with are NOT willing to pay social insurances that are paid by a local employer (this having the right to medical services and retirement income)
- the ""what have you been working on"" syndrom: for managers that have little or no tracking in place BUT do like to ""be in touch"" and micro manage;
- no paid official events: I had a unfortunate event in my family, my father passed away, and had to take 5 days off - did not get paid for it. Local legislation specifies that the employer has to pay 5 working days in such events (also for weddings and child birth).

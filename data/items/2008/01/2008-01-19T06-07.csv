I <i>used</i> to use FreeBSD for everything, but it's my understanding that the once significant differences in performance and stability between Linux and BSD no longer amount to anything. I switched to Gentoo (can not give up source builds!) two years ago.",1200724369

(Just do the Math, housing, insurance, etc.). I would strongggggggggly recommend to try raising something between 0.75M an 1M. I have noticed a lot of fellow hackers  seriously undervaluing the time they spend building a product. Two strong hackers, working for 6 months is eaily $140K expenses(and I am including just the salary an employer would pay). Please, please do not undervalue your time and expertise.<p>With the oncoming recession and all, you do want to have enough in the bank for at least 1 to 2 years, if you are serious about your startup.",1200722629

They might believe in anything from the Norse pantheon to the Greek one.<p>There's Druids, who are proper nature-worshippers and really do perform ceremonies at Stonehenge, when they get a chance in between all the hippies.<p>There's technopagans, who believe in the spirit in the machine.<p>LeVay Satanists tend to get included under 'Paganism', although they might object. Same with Discordians.<p>It's an eclectic group.",1278316743

But it often continues from there, and apatheists can also include as their beliefs ""Questions of theology should not motivate morality.""  Some apatheists are strongly atheistic and not agnostic, saying ""God doesn't exist, but this fact is irrelevant to human affairs.""  I find apatheist theists not inconceivable, ""God exists but who cares?""<p>Kind of like when you ask, ""How many feet are there in a mile?"" and I say, ""The answer to your question is irrelevant because you should switch to metric.  It is wrong to use imperial units for any purpose.  And there are 5,280 feet in a mile.""

1487632,comment,1486708,1487172,0,0,BlakeA,,,"After reading your thoughts about how you feel I can honestly say I currently still feel the same way about my life. It wasn't until Senior year in High School that I started to have the same feelings as you and experienced thoughts of suicide or depression along with anxiety and was given Zoloft by a doctor when I was 18. I was really outgoing in high school though but did have some rough times my senior year with the typical girl bs causing fights and what not. I also had a therapist session every other month or so (didnt start until college) to talk to about whatever really and also problems with my family.<p>Pretty much everything I endured with Zoloft and therapy didn't make me more confident or helped me accept the fact that I don't like to make mistakes and that in turn makes me like the The Too Many Aptitude Problem - TMA. One thing it did help me with was my suicide thoughts and even stopped me from writing good bye letters.<p><a href=""http://knacks.esmartdesign.com/#Aptitudes_and_Mental_Illness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://knacks.esmartdesign.com/#Aptitudes_and_Mental_Illness</a>.  - TMA<p>What I am trying to say is that after every thing I endured over the span of a 1 and half I was on Zoloft I really thought I was recovering from my daze I had. I felt better but not cured. But it seemed it caused a worse daze making me just pass through things in my life without real thought. My mind started to seem off and I changed from my true self. I wasn't as social, I was more cautious, and I think I lost the person I was in Senior year. This all came to a realization after I was finally taken off the drug just as my freshmen year of college came to an end.<p>One thing that can really help is therapy though. So totally give it chance. I know I used the tissues in the room a lot when I talked about what I was going through because his answers/questions always made me really think.<p>To me any drug with any type of extreme side effects is not a solution but it could be for you. Just a thought.<p>Take it easy.",1278316579

Alot of startups will begin with virtualization because its cheaper and an easy way for them to manage resources in the sense that they can split a server for app and db specifics. As they grow and try to scale virtualization can become a pain, cpu and IO is just not the same vs a dedicated server. Its all being contended for by these virtual servers. So quite a few will move to a dedicated server model and instantly see latencies drop and performance sky rocket.

The girl seems to have gotten a copy from some party to that contract, explicitly against its terms, and is now re-trading the item in question (the sheet music file), on her own. Except the law, as written, quite clearly applies just as much to her as it does to the person who violated his contract with the author in providing her the sheet music.<p>The nature of the stuff being traded makes it somewhat different than physical goods, but in principle this is no different any other illegal redistribution of goods, for example reprinting cheap copies of some copyrighted book and selling them on the street at barely above cost.<p>When you talk about your “ethical perspective as a libertarian”, what you apparently mean is that you don’t believe in the concept of copyright (or other “intellectual property”, or perhaps even that society’s laws should be binding on citizens). This is not the usual libertarian “ethical perspective”, and you should be careful about implying that libertarians necessarily feel the same way you do.<p>> <i>successfully earn in the market</i><p>There is only a market for sheet music insofar as that sheet music can’t be trivially gotten for free from a third party. Basically, your comment says something like “we should eliminate the market for sheet music, and the author should do something else.” Well okay, that might be what happens anyway, but that’s not “the market” deciding. For markets to exist requires a set of social structures which regulate its form and function. When those structures break down, as in this case, the market is destroyed.<p>(These social constraints need not be written down or enforced by an official police force, etc. They just need to be commonly agreed upon and have some social weight. I need to know you won’t take my money and run without giving me the promised chicken, or spend all your time copying the book I sold you and selling it behind my back while I’m trying to write the next one.)",1278315593

Based on my experience with a ton of friends stealing media left and right, piracy seems somewhat orthogonal to sales.  Folks seem to mostly steal things that are either very hard to get otherwise (old, out-of-print, not yet released) or that they would never be willing to pay for.  A lot of pirates end up amassing a tremendous amount of media, more than they could ever afford if they were to buy it all.  Often they spend a lot of money buying what they can afford.<p>To complete this rehashed discussion with a repetitive anecdote, I can say with total certainty that I have spent literally thousands of dollars more on music than I would have ever spent if I did not steal any.

1309668,comment,1309288,1309447,0,0,MichaelSalib,,,"<i>In general a mortgage is a pro, it's going to cost you but in the long run you've got a good chance of breaking even or even profiting.</i><p>Robert Shiller, the Yale economist who pretty much invented modern techniques for housing market valuations (the Case-Shiller index), analyzed this question in his book Irrational Exuberance. Based on a centuries worth of housing data, he concluded that the return on investment for housing was very low, on the order of 0.4% per year (you could do worse than read <a href=""http://realestate.yahoo.com/promo/renting-makes-more-financial-sense-than-homeownership.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://realestate.yahoo.com/promo/renting-makes-more-financi...</a> ).<p>Look, if the price to rent ratio in your area is suitably small (taking into account property taxes, transaction fees, insurance) AND if you can commit to being in that area for at least 5 years AND if you have either surplus time or money to spend on maintenance and improvements, then switching from renting to owning might be a good idea. The trouble is that buying a house means buying two goods bundled together: an investment and shelter. Homeowners often sink most of their wealth into the investment part. But housing makes an awful investment for most people: transaction costs are enormous, they can't diversify, and market liquidity tends to be very low just when you need to sell. It would be a disaster if people decided to sink most of their wealth into a single undiversified stock, but people do that all the time with housing.<p>Many people end up buying a house even though that decision doesn't make sense because we have a cultural expectation that you're not really a serious adult until you've bought a house.<p><i>I know my parents bought their house for 75,000GBP and sold it for 250,000GBP in the space of 15 years, because of their mortgage agreement they were paying low rates for the longest of times.</i><p>Making major financial decisions based on anecdote rather than data often ends poorly.<p><i>It's worth noting that a $1000 mortgage is a shitload better than $1000 in rent.</i><p>This is just not true. It depends. If you think you might be moving somewhere else in the next few years to get a better job, than paying rent will probably be much smarter.",1272667996

1309661,comment,1309403,1309612,0,0,buro9,,,"That's pretty much the deal. Only URLs that don't yet include affiliate info gets re-written.<p>There are a couple of companies in this space, viglink, skimlinks, etc. They all operate on the basis that they sign up to <i>every</i> affiliate scheme and they become the single publisher with which the merchants have a relationship (or more likely, the merchants use a marketplace that puts all merchants together so that they can be found).<p>For any affiliate program that viglink/skimlinks is signed up to, should someone click through from your site a 45 to 60 day cookie is usually set by the affiliate provider to show who the last publisher is that made the referral. Should a subsequent purchase be made viglink/skimlinks is credited with the sale and receives the 3.5% > 15% affiliate payment.<p>Catches (there are some)...<p>1) The cookie. Only the last web site to set a cookie gets the affiliate reward. In this case it means other sites actually providing value and setting affiliate click-thrus are going to get their cookie hijacked by posterous using viglink. So this hurts niche sites that really rely on the affiliate schemes.<p>2) The fee. Viglink and SkimLinks both deduct a 25% fee for this service. That's pretty damn high. They are VERY profitable.<p>The benefits...<p>1) As a publisher you get 75% of the money that is currently left on the table.<p>2) You didn't have to sign up to every damn affiliate scheme... actually you'd be declined anyway as whilst a merchant will deal with the big boys they tend to only like smaller guys who stay in their knowledge domain (if you don't run an insurance content site, you don't get the insurance affiliate scheme).<p>Basically viglink and skimlinks are simplifying the whole affiliate thing by doing for the publishers exactly what the merchants already had in places like Commission Junction... which is to provide a one-stop-shop.<p>So... merchants get found via CJ, AffiliateWindow, etc... and publishers get signed up to all merchants via Viglink, SkimLinks, etc.<p>What has ultimately happened is that now there are 2 intermediaries between the publisher and the merchant, both of whom take a slice.<p>I don't blame posterous for doing this, it is just money left on the table. But the cookie hijack will hurt smaller sites for whom the affiliate scheme revenue is a bloodline.",1272667750

I am a second year at Stanford GSB and will be graduating in June and working on building this business full time.  We are going to build a one-stop shop online for bridesmaid dresses.  The bridesmaid dress industry is a $2 billion industry in the U.S. that is fraught with pain and dominated by brick and mortar local mom and pops shops (only 19% of bridesmaid dress purchases were made online in 2009).  We are going to do for the bridesmaid dress industry what Blue Nile did for diamond engagement rings.<p>What we are looking for:\nWeb developer – either one person who can handle both front and back-end or one front-end developer one back-end developer.  We are going to build an e-commerce site that is overlayed with additional functionality, including workflow and coordination tools; this will be a group shopping platform where the bride can act as a mini site administrator with her bridesmaids connected to her account.  We are either going to use Magento as the e-commerce platform upon which we customize or we are building from scratch (we need help evaluating the risk of customizing on top of Magento given that the coordination tools are critical to our value proposition).  <p>Front-end skills should include UX and UI experience.  We would love to have someone who can help us with look and feel but are planning on having a graphic designer work with us on this if we cannot find a front-end developer who can do this too.<p>On the back-end, we would like to set up our website for robust analytics, inventory management, integration with an accounting system, etc.  Past experience building a website end-to-end is a must; experience with e-commerce and/or social-networking platforms is a plus.<p>Founder, Ilana Stern: Prior to the GSB, Ilana worked as a Buyer for Bloomingdales, where she spent a portion of her time purchasing dresses for Bloomingdale’s nationwide.  Last summer she worked for Bonobos, an e-commerce apparel start-up, and as a management consultant at Boston Consulting Group.  Ilana received her BA from University of Pennsylvania in 2005 where she focused on International Relations.<p>If interested, contact Ilana at stern_ilana@gsb.stanford.edu",1272665446

7149994,comment,7145756,7145756,2,0,rexreed,,,"Cool service. At first I didn&#x27;t understand how this worked, but basically you are charged for the number of hours that a server is on your <i>account</i>, not the number of CPU hours you use. So if you have a server on your account, and it sits idle for a whole month, you&#x27;ll still be billed for the whole month. This metered billing service is for folks who are regularly putting up and taking down servers for different reasons, like test servers, increasing / decreasing capacity, and that sort of thing, and especially for folks who use the Linode API to automatically do that. It&#x27;s in place of paying for these in advance and then getting a refund/ credit when you remove the servers. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s obvious to the majority of the folks here.<p>I&#x27;m probably a dork for not realizing that, but it&#x27;s worth stating the obvious for folks like me who thought at first this was metered billing based on CPU usage, not based on # of hours a server is sitting in your account, used or not.",1391079223

Yes, La Banque Postale is technically forbidden from directly speculating on the open market. However:<p>- they can buy and own banks which are, in turn, allowed to speculate (cf. the Dexia bailout)<p>- they offer revolving credits at extremely high rates (more than 15%), which is known to push people further into poverty<p>- they can speculate on markets like the covered bond market (and actually need to, because the deposits are currently not enough to provide all services)<p>- they can speculate on side-effects (eg shift by one day the payment date for social benefits)<p>(This list is not exhaustive.

I guess the real take away here is that there are many ways to achieve the same outcome. Knowledge of quirks is not essential. I would think the most important first step is understanding the requirements, what sort of performance is acceptable given the intended usage, coding for maintainability and ease of usage. For example, the solution for ensuring getCount has the proper context requires  knowing how getCount was implemented then taking extra steps. A better solution may be something like this: \nvar User = {\n\tcount : 1\n};\nUser.getCount = function() {\n        return User.count;\n}",1391078499

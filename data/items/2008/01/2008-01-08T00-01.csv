95820,comment,95646,95646,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Here's my ""startup"" diet:<p>Breakfast:<p>Steel cut oats - $.89/lb at Whole Foods in the bulk bins<p>Dried fruit (raisins, cranberries, blueberries, pineapple, papaya, etc.) - somewhere between $1.50/lb and $8/lb, either in bulk or pre-packaged in the bulk section at Whole Foods<p>Walnuts or pecans - $6-$8/lb from the bulk bin at Whole Foods or Nob Hill<p>Brown sugar and butter - small enough quantity that it barely counts.  Probably $.25 each day.<p>Total price for breakfast: Probably a buck or two...I've never added it all up.  It's surprisingly filling and enjoyable.  I sometimes skip lunch, if I know my girlfriend will be home early, or if I'm meeting someone out for dinner.<p>Lunch:<p>Rice - cheap as free.  I have a rice cooker ($20, or $179 for the ""fuzzy logic"" one that I now have that can do brown rice), so it takes little human time.<p>Vegetables stir fried, or in a fried rice - Whatever is cheapest at the Nob Hill or Milk Pail.  The cheapest stuff is what is in season and tastes best and is most healthy.  So, that's what I buy.  It's about $2 per day for lunch.<p>Cashews or tofu or eggs for protein (I'm vegetarian).  About $.50 per day.<p>Sometimes, I'll make enough hummus and stack of flatbread for two or three days worth of lunch.  That's super cheap.  About $1 per meal.  One <$1 bag of garbanzo beans is enough for a huge bowl of hummus, though the tahini and spices can add to the price a bit.<p>Total lunch price: Probably about $3.  Prep time about 15 minutes.<p>Dinner:<p>Girlfriend is home for dinner, so she determines that meal mostly.  It's either eat out, order a pizza, or eat various crappy carb-filled meals.  Pasta is a staple.  Mostly still pretty cheap when we eat at home, even though a lot of it comes from boxes.<p>Add a bag of apples or other fresh fruit and some various nuts from the bulk bins for snacks, and you've got a balanced healthy days worth of food.<p>I tried ordering from Amazon, but ended up never having all of the stuff I needed, anyway.  You've gotta have milk for boxed mac and cheese.  Eggs for a lot of stuff.  Fresh cheese for good sandwiches.  Bread (and I like the good stuff...crusty sour dough and such).  It just doesn't allow one to build complete meals.  I have been known to ""wing it"" by picking up a few fresh items from the asian market that's walking distance from here, and buying large quantities of the dry goods every two or three weeks...in order to minimize time spent shopping.<p>But, the fact is, that I'm less productive when I fall into a rut of being at home all the time.  Sometimes dramatically so.  Getting out helps.",1199753567

You can get really fine-grained in your scaling strategy, and can balance multiple projects on the same server much better than you could with Apache.<p>If you really want the ""automatic blah blah blah"" approach, you can always use fcgi with Apache.  Many people do (including 37signals).",1199751841

95806,comment,95708,95708,0,0,scooter53080,,,"I tried this library sometime around May of last year.  I read through a wrox book called ""CSS Instant Results"" and many of the discussed CSS layouts required use of the IE7 script to work properly.  I had some problems with the max/min width/height adjustments not holding when the browser was resized, and additionally there was some flicker when resizing.  At the time, it appeared from the site and forum that there was not a lot of active development going on.  Now it looks like there has been an update, and active development has resumed, so I would be interested to look into it again in the future.",1199750965

In a startup I would suggest your efforts would be better working on your core competency.  For many people, publishing to the web is just a tiny piece of their startup.",1199750719

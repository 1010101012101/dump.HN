Winter time is unadjusted and tracks a true solar day.  Summer time is adjusted, and indeed it's adjusted in the direction you favor (to provide more daylight hours at night).",1357977584

What I think is especially touching about this is how he gently deconstructs his success, demystifying his own legend by pulling back the curtain on what would have otherwise appeared to be a string of miraculous accomplishments. In the process, he reveals himself to be a sensitive, seemingly grateful, and thoughtful person.<p>May he be remembered well; he seems to deserve it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://aaronsw.jottit.com/howtoget"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aaronsw.jottit.com/howtoget</a>",1357977578

If you can make sure that you present the same content to the users and the crawler then you should be fine.<p>Anyways, the preferred method for such single page seo friendly URLS is to have hashbang in them. E.g. domainname/#!/category/value. When the search engine crawls to this page it will crawl to domainname/?_escaped_fragment_=/category/value. So for the crawler you will have to write search engine friendly page with all the info that you want it to index. But also make sure that the same info is presented to the users. The UI could be different in both the cases but the content should be same.
When the search engine indexes these pages, it will present the url in #! formats in the search results. For more details check out the link that mileschet has provided.",1357977390

A couple billion USD is not a big deal (financially or militarily, other than as a signal).<p>Still, as a Japanese resident, I am happy with this use of my tax money. With the Cold War with China already well underway, I think Japan needs a much stronger military than at any time since losing WWII. Partly because of the economic ascendance of China (which a lot of people these days somehow forget is a brutal, repressive, totalitarian state, not an advanced democracy like Japan) and partly because of the decline of the USA as comptent and rational actor on the world stage. Treaty-bound or not, I don't have much faith that the USA would do much wrt Chinese aggression toward Japan, short of an actual invasion (which hopefully will remain very unlikely).",1357977257

A substantial portion of our publisher partners content was downloaded in an unauthorized fashion using the network at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of our participating institutions. The content taken was systematically downloaded using an approach designed to avoid detection by our monitoring systems.<p>The downloaded content included more than 4 million articles, book reviews, and other content from our publisher partners' academic journals and other publications; it did not include any personally identifying information about JSTOR users.<p>We stopped this downloading activity, and the individual responsible, Mr. Swartz, was identified. We secured from Mr. Swartz the content that was taken, and received confirmation that the content was not and would not be used, copied, transferred, or distributed.<p>The criminal investigation and todays indictment of Mr. Swartz has been directed by the United States Attorneys Office. It was the governments decision whether to prosecute, not JSTORs. As noted previously, our interest was in securing the content.

5046841,comment,5046455,5046757,2,0,Timothee,,,"A few years ago, I worked on a video player and looked around a lot to figure out if designers tended to go for ""show action that will happen when clicked"" (e.g. video is playing, so display the ""pause"" icon) or ""current state"" (e.g. video is playing, so display the ""play"" icon). For a video player, you'll have things like the play/pause button, the video quality, etc.<p>I think the conclusion is that in a lot of cases there are no conclusion. There are no definite best practice, both can be justified and both are used pretty widely.<p>(PS: I just checked Vimeo, Youtube and Hulu. It seems that they tend to agree on showing pause when it's playing. However Hulu and Youtube both show the mute icon when it's muted, so they're not consistent regarding action vs. state. My point is that for video players, there seems to be a potential best practice here, but in general ""action vs. state"" is not clear-cut)",1357975521
5046840,comment,5045764,5046157,2,0,mrb,,,"I think what you mean to say is that you need to match the performance of the current network. But this <i>would</i> put you at 50% of the global mining speed. For example the current network mines at 20 Thash/s, so you need to bring another 20 Thash/s for a majority attack, in which, an attacker can do the following: <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#Attacker_has_a_lot_of_computing_power"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#Attacker_has_a_lot_of_...</a><p>Anyway, Titan is not powerful enough to perform a majority attack. First of all, there is no Bitcoin miner optimized for the latest GK104/GK110 Tesla and GeForce GPUs. With current miners, people report speeds of barely 110 Mhash/s on the GeForce GTX 680, which should translate to ~140 Mhash/s on the Tesla K20X (which is only 30% faster in terms of 32-bit integer ops per second.) Titan has 18688 K20X, so that's only 2.6 Thash/s total. Far from the 20 Thash/s required. It would still bring 400 coins/day, or $5600/day :)<p>I theorize here [1] that based on the number of ALUs and clock frequency, that a properly optimized miner should be in theory 4x-6x faster than this on GK104/GK110, bringing Titan to 10-16 Thash/s. (Nobody bothered optimizing Nvidia because everybody is mining on more efficient Radeon GPUs or FPGAs.) Still not enough to match 20 Thash/s. Disclaimer: I have only programmed AMD GPUs, never Nvidia. Maybe there is a reason this 4x-6x theoretical perf gain has never been realized, such as the inability to execute 1 32-bit integer instruction per ALU per clock due to instruction latencies greater than 1 clock, or throughput being less than 1 instruction per clock... I don't know. Theoretical FLOPS numbers published by Nvidia indicate that floating point instructions, as opposed to integer instns, can run at 1 instruction per ALU per clock. Which makes it even weirder that there would be such a huge perf gap between int and fp.<p>[1] <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=129292.msg1381510#msg1381510"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=129292.msg1381510#ms...</a>",1357975419

What's so special about it as a design tool is that it gives you the ability to instantly iterate on an idea without recompiling. The tight feedback loop allows you to dial in designs (and engineering approaches to visual things in general) and come to the right conclusions quickly.<p>We would start off learning the tool, go over some tips, and then dive into creating some sample projects. One project idea is to recreate Coverflow from scratch (this would teach a lot of aspects in QC).<p>This one would be aimed towards designers and engineers with a front-end persuasion.<p>In my years working as a UI designer, and now more recently also as an engineer, it is all too common that there is a disconnect in the design of an application and its making. These workshops would aim to teach new techniques and create bridges between disciplines that would most certainly result in better software and higher productivity.<p>Is this something that you would be interested in?

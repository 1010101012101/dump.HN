But as you rightly point out in this case, help is needed. There&#x27;s a limit on how much can be streamed based simply on packet size & transfer, even though PPSP is much more efficient than existing protocols due to the way it handles hash management (merkle trees and munro hashes) bandwidth is bandwidth, (latency & asymmetric aside).<p>Again, PPSP is a transport protocol, not <i>just</i> a live video stream.

This power, like all others vested in Congress, is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the Constitution.&quot;<p>This is not a case where the meaning of the word has drifted from what it meant at the time of the founding. I&#x27;m quite conservative in my Constitutional interpretation, but I think conservatives get the Commerce Clause wrong. Its broad and was intended to be. The anti-federalist framers thought the &quot;interstate&quot; part would be a limit, but didn&#x27;t concieve of a world where every transaction would cross state borders. Indeed, they lived in a world where market transactions were the exception. But saying that we should interpret the plain text more narrowly because the world has changed since then is a very &quot;living Constitution&quot; thing to do.",1393548152

But there&#x27;s quite a few things to consider here:<p>* Text messages and most other chat protocols require that you trust multiple hardware vendors, multiple software vendors, and multiple telcos. By comparison, iMessage only requires that you trust a single company, Apple.<p>* As long as the operating system and messaging software is closed source, it would be impossible to eliminate the requirement to trust Apple anyway. If you really need serious security, you shouldn&#x27;t be relying on any closed source third party systems, period.<p>* This is about as secure as it could ever get without requiring users to be educated about security principles. Given that iMessage is foremost a seamless alternative to text messages, it&#x27;s difficult to imagine how they could make it more secure without compromising utility.<p>* The implementation details mean that any Government snooping must be done with Apple&#x27;s knowledge, and will require the blessing of Apple&#x27;s legal department. This might not be a particularly high bar to cross, but it does mean that Governments aren&#x27;t running rampant, analyzing every message sent.<p>* The United States government isn&#x27;t the only bad actor out there.

Does not overtly seek a romantic relationship<p>2. Sexual tension is not a compelling foil or conflict for the character<p>3. Is not thrown into an action role purely for the spectacle of a woman kicking ass<p>4. Is not shouted down or treated differently specifically because she is a woman.<p>5. Is not shown in a gratuitously sexual light (she is in her underwear the same time everyone else is logically in their underwear).<p>6. Is unequivocally the hero of the movie. In fact, in both movies [spoiler alert for 20 year old movies], it&#x27;s quite notable that she is literally the last human being standing, and she wins on her own terms.<p>No other contenders, that I can think of, meet this standard, <i>especially</i> in the action film role: Catwoman, Aeon Flux, Tomb Raider...nope. Clarice Starling...even if you want to argue that no sexual tension exists between her and Hannibal Lecter (even though he specifically refers to it), much of the non-gruesome psychological conflict her character faces is precisely because she is a woman in a (tall) man&#x27;s world. Beatrice in Kill Bill...great role, but again, it only works because she is a woman and it is a spectacle, even if empowering (i.e. could you imagine Kill Bill being made with a man in the role?)<p>The only woman character who comes close to the unisex appeal of Ripley is Marge Gunderson in Fargo. Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty slim pickings...whereas for males, there are too many to count.<p>Anyway, I sometimes wonder how much growing up with Alien/Aliens affected how I think about gender roles and imbalance. Those being among the first and the most interesting of the action movies I&#x27;d ever seen (then, and today), I kind of think that the idea of a woman action hero was <i>completely normal</i> to me.

7316470,comment,7316312,7316312,39,0,tptacek,,,"The background you want to understand the TLS 1.2 ciphersuite benefits:<p>TLS was designed and standardized before cryptography figured out the proper order of encryption and authentication, or, for that matter, that authentication was even required. It dates back to an era where designs based on what were best practices at the time often eschewed authentication (of plaintext or ciphertext) altogether; instead, designers assumed that because attackers didn&#x27;t have crypto keys, they couldn&#x27;t tamper with ciphertexts, because their decryptions would result in gibberish.<p>A few years after SSL3/TLS, it was widely understood that cryptosystems required authentication (the &quot;gibberish decryption&quot; defense is often just a speed bump). And then it was mathematically proven that there&#x27;s a proper order to the two operations: cryptosystems should encrypt, then they should authenticate the ciphertext. Doing it this way (among other things) denies attackers the opportunity to conduct chosen ciphertext attacks, which in turn closes off a variety of side channels (such as error oracles, which were introduced in the symmetric crypto literature a few years after this).<p>The net result is that the old TLS ciphersuites are a mess with regards to encryption and authentication. They do authenticate, using HMAC (which is fine) in a generic composition. But they authenticate plaintext, which means attackers can play games with ciphertexts; one result of this was the Lucky 13 padding oracle attack.<p>AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 are modern authenticated cipher constructions. They are conceptually very similar. Both are stream ciphers (and, in fact, both are designs based on the concept of &quot;CTR [counter] mode&quot;). Both use polynomial MACs instead of cryptographic hash MACs (you can think of a poly MAC as a thermonuclear CRC algorithm). AES-GCM is very fast in hardware (because it&#x27;s a NIST standard that chipset vendors have optimized for). ChaCha20-Poly1305 was designed to be fast in software as well.<p>Another bit of backstory you might want to know concerns the italicized &quot;<i>very</i> difficult&quot; Langley used to describe software AES-GCM. AES-GCM uses a poly MAC that wants GF(2^n) multiplication and modular reduction. Fast software implementations of GCM rely heavily on lookup tables. Lookup tables entries are aggressively cached as they&#x27;re hit, which makes the timing of software AES-GCM heavily dependent on specific bit values of secrets, which is dangerous.",1393547812

He wants to stream a 1080p video at 1mb/s to 10,000 people.<p>In the case above, without a relay server (as you suggest),\nHow delayed will the data be for viewer 10,001, assuming every peer has the same connection profile at Joe ?\n<i>Hint</i> - Its going to be minutes, not seconds.<p>Second question: What happens when several peers in that chain disconnect at once?<p>Now as far as your second comment, that feels out of place. Bandwidth is bandwidth. If you are on a 100kb/s line in the middle of africa, your preference is going to be a user to server to user streaming environment since it will be reliable and not require other users with little bandwidth available to them to also stream. In fact, using a P2P system will cost them more money, not less. Its going to be inconsistent, unreliable and slower than p2s2p streaming.",1393546767

7316303,comment,7315244,7315919,4,0,eqdw,,,"I&#x27;m a young guy who makes approximately that much, and I feel like I&#x27;m not getting very far either.<p>I moved from my hometown of Winnipeg, Canada to Silicon Valley to build my career. In moving, I <i>tripled</i> my salary. I am definitely better off financially for having moved, but my daily quality of life is lower. Here&#x27;s some food for thought:<p>* HOUSING QUALITY AND COST. This is, bar none, the most important aspect of my currently feeling like I&#x27;m barely getting by. In Winnipeg, if you&#x27;re roommating an apartment ~30 minutes bus from downtown, your rent will be around $300/mo. 1br to yourself will set you back $500-$1000 depending where you live. The fanciest 1br penthouse I could find was $1700. Personally, I lived in a rather &#x27;expensive&#x27;, nice 1br apartment that was in a trendy, gentrifying neighbourhood about 1.5 miles from my work downtown. It cost me $850/mo and that was a luxury. I could&#x27;ve gotten much cheaper if I wasn&#x27;t so picky about location. Compare with SF: Housing here costs a fortune. And strict rent control + high paying jobs means that the housing they do build is marketed to high income people (read: twitter millionaires). So not only is nothing available in a reasonable price range, but there are many social factors that try to make $3500/mo studios sound normal. In SF, paying a similar percentage of my take-home income as I did in Winnipeg, I get a shitty, tiny, &#x27;jr 1 bedroom&#x27; (~400sqft) apartment nestled between a noisy road and a freeway. I can walk to work, but it&#x27;s 3 miles one way, and takes me through some areas I don&#x27;t feel comfortable walking alone in.<p>Housing cost anchors everything else. In Winnipeg I&#x27;d be paying $300/mo for what I have and where I have it; in SF I pay $1600. My salary tripled; it didn&#x27;t quintuple. And because housing costs are the anchor, it makes everything else more expensive by comparison<p>* KEEPING UP WITH THE HIGH-POWERED JONESES. Tech has a lot of young, rich people in it. And young rich people don&#x27;t always make the wisest decisions. Consequently, there&#x27;s a lot of conspicuous consumption going on. I feel like I can&#x27;t afford to keep up, because I&#x27;m financially disciplined and highly value long term stability. I look at other people and assume they do the same. Perhaps they don&#x27;t. Maybe they&#x27;re spending 50% of their disposable income on cheap glasses, expensive jeans, and cocktails with PBR in them. I spend almost 50% of my disposable (post-living-expenses) income on savings. Appearances can be misleading, and if you don&#x27;t consciously keep aware of this, it can be demoralizing<p>* A NEW NORMAL. I would say that, proportional to cost of living, my real income has not substantially risen by moving. However, it has <i>inflated</i>. And inflation is a good thing when compared against uninflated prices. For example, flights. A flight from YWG to SFO costs ~$700, regardless if I live in Winnipeg ($40k income, $400/mo) or SF ($120k income, $1600/mo rent). As a result, my day-to-day standard of life hasn&#x27;t increased, but my ability to do things outside of my day to day has. When I lived in Winnipeg, I was unable to take more than one flight per year, anywhere (and I usually spent it on professional develoment-related things). Now, I think nothing of dropping a few hundred dollars to fly to a conference on a weekend. The same goes for nationally-marketed goods such as electronics. My rent might&#x27;ve gone waaay up, but an iphone costs $800USD regardless of where I live. It&#x27;s easy to overlook this, because it is not a typical everyday thing.<p>* LONG TERM SAVINGS. This is a little bit more important for me, since I&#x27;m paying into SS but as a non-citizen, will never collect a dime. But savings. Savings don&#x27;t really have an emotional feel to them. They&#x27;re not tangible, they&#x27;re just some numbers on pages. If you&#x27;re pumping a lot of money into savings (like I am), it can feel like that is just money that&#x27;s disappearing. But nothing could be farther from the truth. Many people live in the US month-to-month, and are one crisis away from bankruptcy. My parents both grew up in households like that. Hell, my parents&#x27; households are CURRENTLY like that. I, on the other hand, am squirreling away much of my money. I&#x27;m maxing my 401k, so that in my 60s I&#x27;ll be ok. I&#x27;m building up some personal savings, to achieve some personal goals (largely investment related, with the purpose of rescuing me from wage slavery). These are very important things, but they FEEL like money that just disappears",1393545838

BTW, I am in Dallas, TX.\nSo I want to return to Java. I have been studying for the certification. In addition, writing a few projects. My goal is be really good with Java/J2EE and then apply for jobs.\nRecently, a friend recruiter approached me. He says that currently $100K-$105K for PHP programmers are very common. He says that with my experience I should have no problem getting up to $105K.\nHe also knows that I want go to Java and says it will be very difficult for me to get a Java job without pay cut.\nI&#x27;m so confused.

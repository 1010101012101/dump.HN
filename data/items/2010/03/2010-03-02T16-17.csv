Give one player all the spades and one all the clubs. Shuffle the hearts and put them face down.<p>Now repeat 13 times: turn up a card from the pile of hearts; each player chooses one of their cards; they reveal them simultaneously; the player with the higher card gets to keep that heart. (If the players play equal cards, no one gets it.)<p>When you're done, add up the values of the hearts each player has won (according to any convention you choose; different conventions give slightly different games; I prefer A..K = 1..13 points). Highest total wins.<p>See <a href=""http://www.icynic.com/~don/psych.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icynic.com/~don/psych.html</a> for more information. (That page has diamonds and hearts the other way around from me, which of course makes no difference.)<p>(I claimed that PJ is simpler than BC's game, but my description is longer than his. No contradiction: he imported the standard ordering of poker hands by reference, whereas I described all the rules of my game explicitly.)",1267549176

1161852,comment,1160474,1160474,0,0,abyssknight,,,"Honestly, you shouldn't have a problem. For your references, usually personal relationships and contacts are fine for early in your career. If they ask if they can call your current employer say no, and explain that they don't know you are looking. Most employers will understand that, and will be fine with it.<p>The best thing you can do is prepare a short portfolio of links, and publicly facing projects. Because your reference list is short, you need to be able to demonstrate your work instead. Your personality will show up during the phone and face to face interviews.<p>That said, my last position's interview was so simple it confused me. They just asked if I worked with the technology they used, and if I was interested in learning some new stuff. A few questions to gauge my experience, and I was in. Once you're in the door, at your desk, is when the real interview begins. Here in Florida you can be let go without a reason, and most companies do a contract-to-hire these days for that reason.",1267549118
1161850,comment,1161293,1161293,0,0,hga,,,"As far as I could tell perhaps the #1 Sun died was fantastically inept management, most especially in sales:<p>Sun just wouldn't talk to you directly if you weren't buying mainframe levels ($$$) of hardware.  At some point they established a site where you could punch in your credit card, but if you needed more you were at the mercy of their ""VARs"" and resellers, who in far too many cases also wouldn't give you the time of day (note this was CPU agnostic, it was true for their x86 hardware according to the stories below and for SPARC hardware in my personal experience).<p>A little quality time with a search engine will find stories from all sorts of startups upset that they were forced to buy Dell since Dell actually wanted to sell stuff to them in any quantity (at the same time HP's sales function was also messed up in different ways).<p>So Sun missed out on all the startups that became really big; by the time these companies were buying in mainframe  quantities Sun was just a bad memory.<p>One thing that I noticed happening later was companies dropping Sun because their hardware kept changing.  In one case they dropped a great discrete Intel Ethernet chip in favor of the ones on the nVidia chipset, in another, they kept changing the management interface.  (A bit like one of the things that hurt Compaq, you could buy many copies of the same model, yet adjacent serial numbers might have totally different motherboards.)<p>It's no accident that Sun's sales organization seems to be where Oracle is making the biggest quickest changes (hiring thousands of salesmen as I recall).<p>ADDED THOUGHT: I don't think the thesis in the linked article flies.  As I see it, it posits that if Sun had done a (much) better job with open source, the business gained from that could have covered for their failures elsewhere.<p>Better, I say, to have fixed both sets of failures.",1267549105

What would the up-side have been for the company telling you these things?  Wouldn't your bad-mouthing have just become worse, with your rant here (and elsewhere?) even nastier?<p>Yes, it would be nice if we could all tell no-hires exactly what they need to work on, but it is a very rare person who would say ""Thanks for the rejection!

I do try to market these things; the success rate is just so small that I get discouraged and stop.<p>I hate using blogs as a marketing device -- it feels really scummy to me.

And oh yeah, nobody was told that before paying the $400.<p>Needless to say, not all the Amazon reviewers were too happy about that.<p>The reality is, Archos fixed the problems, and now that tablet is basically a desktop machine in terms of web browsing and video playing ability.  You can connect a keyboard and mouse (for writing HN posts), if you want, and you can output and record 720p video / 5.1 channel audio.  (And it plays real-world video formats, not just what Apple sells in its video store.)<p>Honestly, I thought Archos was quite clueless when they released the 5"" device, but they are doing better now.  I emailed them asking why their media player app couldn't display Japanese fonts, and the next firmware update had a Japanese font.  Of course, I would have been a lot happier if I had write access to my own filesystem... then I could have added it myself.  I would also like documentation / code for controlling the DSP chip, so I can write a media player app that doesn't suck.  Archos has kept the same codebase on all their devices, and while the video decoding works OK now, the UI code is just horrible.  I think the whole app is a bunch of if statements like ""if( volume > 0 && headphones_attached && phase_of_moon == FullMoon && ... )"".  Sometimes they forget to cover all the conditions, and weird stuff happens.<p>(To be cynical, I doubt we will ever see the tools we need to write a good media player app, and that Archos will eventually be dead from buggy software and obscurity.  If that happens, hopefully someone else will release a Linux-based music/video player, because I am tired of Apple dominating this market.)<p><i>Or... maybe tech-no-media just didn't tell me about all the publisher relationships that 'droid manufacturers have been developing (à la Steve Jobs since January).</i><p>Nobody is buying the iPad for the ebooks.

Also, knowing more about the company, I wouldn't have been a great fit (no fan of Microsoft, and they use Wasabi, which I understand to be a VB dialect). So I hold no grudge that I didn't get hired-- just business, and very likely the right decision-- but I was pretty damn <i>surprised</i> not to get an office interview. I'm reasonably smart (top 100 Putnam) and I made it to the final round of DE Shaw's process shortly out of school, and had plenty of opportunities (even then, in 2008) to move back into finance. So it's pretty shocking that they didn't at least bring me into the office. Ok, but that's their decision and within their rights; they haven't done anything wrong, unprofessional, or embarrassing. Not yet, anyway...<p>Here's where Fog Creek begins to look bad: remember what I said about being laid off in the midst of the worst recession ever? After getting turned down for the interview, I called Fog Creek to ask why I didn't get it, wanting to make future applications, to other companies, more successful. No explanation. No tips or advice. Nothing. ""We'll call you if we can release that information."" No call. I tried again, 2 weeks later. Nothing. I'm sorry, but if you can't take 5 minutes out of your day to explain to someone who is down on his luck why he didn't get an interview, then you've checked your humanity at the door and crossed the line into sleazy corporate ""neither confirm nor deny"" territory.<p>To make it worse, I know that Joel is friends with my ex-boss. So Fog Creek's decision not to explain the rationale to me casts aspersion onto him. Not very professional. (Of course, I have no idea if Joel had anything whatsoever to do with this matter. Still, it makes the company look bad.)<p>Anyway, I rebounded, I've moved on and I'm doing well. In 10 years when I have a bit of success to my name and I'm hiring, I won't hold it against someone to have worked there. Even if that person worked in their HR department in the summer of 2008. But this is why I think Fog Creek is overrated. I'm sure they're a great company, and they have some impressive people, but they still have a touch of the old regime in them... or at least in one subsection of the HR department as of two years ago.<p>(TL;DR version: The ""cool company"" image of Fog Creek is overstated, as my experience attests. Still, their programmers are impressive.)",1267548266

1161786,comment,1161405,1161405,0,0,pbhjpbhj,,,"From the papers conclusion:<p>><i>EP [Evolutionary Psychology] can provide a more parsimonious explanation, consistent with the evidence presented in Tables 1 and 3, that women have inherently less desire to earn money than men, and the sex difference increases as women have better things to do, reproductively speaking. From the perspective of EP, there is absolutely no reason to expect why men and women should have identical predispositions and inclinations toward earning money. Women’s evolved psychological mechanisms, adapted to the EEA [ancestral environment or the environment of evolutionary adaptedness], would not compel them to engage in activities that did not increase their reproductive success in the ancestral environment.<p>Just as earlier studies (Farkas et al., 1997; Herrnstein & Murray, 1994, Chapter 14; O’Neill, 1990) demonstrate that ‘‘discrimination’’ is not necessary to account for the race difference in earnings, my analyses show that ‘‘discrimination’’ is not necessary to explain the sex diﬀerence in earnings. Due to evolved diﬀerences in their preferences and desires, women should be less motivated to earn money than men, because resource accumulation did not increase women’s reproductive success in the EEA whereas it did increase men’s.</i><p>[] = my edits",1267548038

So when I see the same story from different sources I like to read them all, but equally, I prefer that discussion and comments end up in one place.<p>So I try to add value to HN in part by making sure these things get cross-referenced.  Mostly I think people find it harmless.  Some people actively dislike it and vote me down, others actively like it and vote me up.  Yet others find it both irritating and useful in equal measure, so no doubt they are confused and conflicted.  That's their problem.<p>But I'm slowly stopping doing this anyway.  I get the occasional comment saying it's really appreciated, but in general I'm reducing the time I spend here anyway.<p>And that's the rationale behind the comment.<p>ADDED FURTHER IN EDIT: Or perhaps you saw that I'd got the reference wrong and just down-voted me instead of bothering to tell me.

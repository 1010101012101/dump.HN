4530330,comment,4530185,4530185,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Perhaps you could help me out here, your quest is to find a 'decent job', what does that mean to you? Clearly you pay your rent, clothe and feed yourself on the bank job so by some definitions it is 'decent', no doubt it has some sort of retirement plan you can contribute to and some days of paid vacation.<p>What you don't say is what <i>you</i> want to do. What are you passionate about? You know that ""just doing your job is not enough"" so you start a side project, great how did you pick it? Are you more passionate about it than your current job, if not why not? You had complete freedom to work on any side project you wanted. Do you even enjoy programming? Why do you do it? Why not gardening, or auto repair, or architecture?<p>People who are passionate about what they are doing are 10x better employees than ones who are doing it for some externally generated reason. Ask yourself what you really like doing and pursue that. You've got a job (great) and if you discover your passion is something else use your job as a springboard to cover expenses why you develop enough runway to leap into what your passionate about. Don't try to do that at a start-up though, its really really hard to be passionate about something other than the start-up's mission and be successful.",1347829049

Java's a big corporation language and it just doesn't map well on a hacky nature startups.<p>Another thing is not the resume itself, but its <i>format</i>.

All of their resume's looked the same.  Full of java related keywords.  All with the same experience.  None of them had soul.  None of them seemed to develop anything out of their comfort zone.  NONE of them knew what github was nor had an account.<p>Out of 300 people, over about 6 months we found only 2 java developers that seemed to be worth anything outside of their extremely large teams they were used to working in.<p>Now I don't know anything about you nor have I seen a resume of yours but I will say that when I see Java developer with 10 years experience writing java, it sort of already puts a negative connotation on the experience right away.<p>If your trying to sell yourself for a startup, your going to have to do some major overhaul of your selling points.<p>You are really going to have to highlight your experience with other technologies and things you are doing to keep yourself current with the times.  What have you done in the past 10 years besides java?  A lot has changed since 2002 in the world of development!<p>Last but not least, I can't believe you turned down an opportunity to work in a new environment.  If all you have is years and years of java and someone (even if your personalities don't match) offers you a job doing something else and you don't take it!  Its obvious that times are really not that tough in your current position.<p>Your going to have to suck up your pride a little and get some relevant experience in the job type you want before you can become picky about personality matching.  You should be happy for the opportunity to even get considered.<p>Knock that AOL syndrome out of your nose and dig in.  If you really want out of the banking industry, get a job for the experience.  NOT to meet your new best friend or be on extremely hipster wavelengths with your boss...<p>To me you don't really sound all that desperate if your passing up job offers.",1347828961

Github account?<p>3. Maybe this is the case. When I was searching for a job last time (and landed this job in a bank) I noticed how differently banks and non-banks react to my resume. In short, for banks I have worked in a company they know and did the things they want to do too. For a software companies, I worked in a boring BigCo and did some things they never will deal with. It's all great but it's not clear how to fix this  I wouldn't say there's loads of attractive tech firms in London compared to SV, so if I'll narrow my search to try to find better suited companies, I'll be left with that Twitter opening.<p>5.

The only difference I can see is that Dreamhost is probably the most popular such service, so that strategy bites them in the ass more often than others.<p>For me, though, having relied on more than just registration and DNS through Dreamhost and gotten screwed too many times, moving to Webfaction made a world of difference.

It is as if there are two populations: those who can [program], and those who cannot [program], each with its own independent bell curve.""<p>It's making an unwarranted generalization to say that this is evidence of people being unable to learn to program. It's more likely that each teacher has a methodology that can succeed with students having some set of characteristics, and the teacher assumes that because he or she can't teach a particular student to program, then nobody can.<p>In a college environment, the teacher probably has an inflexible, non-individualized methodology that is expected to work with everyone in a 100-person introductory class -- it's impossible for one teacher to give individual instruction to that many students. Our teaching system also implicitly assumes that everybody in the same class has the same background knowledge and can learn at the same pace.<p>Also, at the college level, many intro-level CS courses are taught by grad students. When I was a grad student teaching intro CS at an Ivy League school many years ago, we had absolutely no training in how to teach, so we pretty much had to teach our students the same way we ourselves were taught as undergrads. The same old methods get passed down and reused with little thought as to whether they work well or not. Better methods might have succeeded with more students, but the university didn't seem to give a shit about how undergrads were taught as long as some fraction of them did OK.<p>I think it's likely that a lot of people who can't learn programming from a college class could learn it if they were taught one-on-one. And I think this is true for many other topics taught in school: math, physics, writing, etc.",1347828189

Though I'm curious to know what test you're going to apply to make sure they know what you intend to teach. If it's just a prompt ""write hello world"", I bet someone could teach a chimpanzee (or, if he was still alive, Alex the parrot) to do that on prompting and it doesn't seem very remarkable. (Now solving FizzBuzz when prompted, without them having ever seen the complete solution before, would be remarkable.)<p>My bet is finding a ""decent programmer"" with such an IQ, whether you teach someone with such an IQ to be a decent programmer or find one at some company doesn't matter, so long as they're decent. I'll charitably define a ""decent programmer"" as one who in principle could get hired (or has been hired) at any company doing programming and related tasks and not get (or have been) fired for incompetence at programming. So solving ""real problems"" is kind of a requirement, which I'll cop-out and define them as ""problems the manager asks to be solved"". They shouldn't be complicated but the most mediocre of currently employed junior or intern programmers across the world should be able to accomplish them. Also charitably, gluing code blocks written by other people shall count as programming and solving a real problem. I think there's someone out there with an IQ of 97 doing such a job, but 85?

I'm not a traffic engineer, and that's the sort of question they would be best equipped to hash out.  It certainly needs to be a <i>component</i> of the law, or a policeman would have no legal way to stop some lunatic who drives at the posted 75 MPH limit in a foggy blizzard.<p>I do know that ""reasonable and prudent"" was the exclusive rule on Montana's highways prior to the 55 MPH Federal NMSL law in the 1970s, and that they tried returning to it for a time after the NMSL was repealed.  For whatever reason, it didn't work for them, and they went back to setting specific limits.<p><i>And the point of my reply is that speed limits are not artificially low, that's simply your contention, one that you have failed to provide any proof for.</i><p>Sorry, I'm not a librarian either.  I'm satisfied that my position is correct and I have the same right (or lack thereof) to state it here that you do.<p>As far as our disagreement is concerned, it might help if we could drill down and find out exactly where our opinions diverge.  Here are the premises I'm working from:<p>1) To optimize safe and efficient traffic flow, speed limits should be set by traffic engineers, and not by mayors, police chiefs, legislators, or soccer moms.  (My main concern is highway speed limits, as I almost never find myself exceeding posted limits in populated areas, but I assert that this is true in all cases.)<p>2) However, not all speed limits are set by traffic engineers.  It's indisputable that some are set for political reasons, and no, I am not going to ""provide citations"" for something this obvious.  Subjectively, as my initial post in the thread stated, I'd go so far as to say that <i>most</i> limits are politically influenced.  An organization such as www.motorists.org would be a better place to look for cases and statistics.<p>3) People who have the political authority to set or influence speed limits, and who are <i>not</i> qualified traffic engineers, almost always want <i>lower</i> limits than the engineers would advise setting for the conditions at hand.<p>From these I conclude that it cannot be the case that speed limits are always set at the optimal point for safe and efficient traffic flow.  Experience as a driver suggests that speed limits are not commonly set at artificially high values.  That leaves only one conclusion: that at least some speed limits are set artificially low.<p>Which <i>specific</i> assertion(s) do you disagree with, and why?  I'd invite you to show this reply to your friends in traffic engineering as well, so we could see what areas they would agree/disagree with.",1347828137

You have specific background in some languages and environment. It is hard for the companies to decide where to put you. If possible, start with networking with people in your target companies. Get to them to know you first, they will help you on finding the right position to apply to.<p>About the Twitter manager who didn't reply. Try again, with other methods. Find a direct reference instead of simply email him. Or you can hang out with some other Twitter engineers first and they may help you out.<p>Second, for the interview part, there is little description here so I am not sure if you did anything wrong. Generally, solve the problem by working and discussing with the interviewer; showing your passion; and relate yourself to the company. It is hard for the interviewer to see the value of your project and weigh them during the interview, solving the problems they give is more important.<p>Also, there might be a bias since you have the major bank background.

However, we've only been working on it for about 2 months and need maybe another 2-4 months to release.<p>One thing that's similar between both of our products is that users build up their profile with ranking/awards as they interact with the site, and since we're targeting the same group of users, we're worried that since we are going to be beat to the market, those users won't be interested in signing up with our product and building up their profile again.<p>What should we ask ourselves to see if we should abandon our project, or continue?

People who photograph or shoot firearms might know about this: our brains tend to favor one of our eyes (just like left/right hand dominance), so we have a kind of overlap where the image we see is not 50/50 between each eye. That might point to a mental bias to find slightly unbalanced compositions (that approach the GR) more pleasant than completely balanced ones.<p>The last sentence - that we find unbalanced compositions actually more balanced - is empirical, not just speculation from my part.

What do I do wrong?",,"(using a throwaway account)<p>I'm in the middle of a very painful job search in London and here for help. My background is Java, I used it for 10 years in a very latency- and performance-critical environments, so I can say I'm very familiar with the nuts and bolts of language and the JVM. As any HN oldie, I know that just doing your job is not often enough, so in parallel I launched my own iPhone app (which as of today grew to 20 KLOC of C and Objective-C) that was covered by major news outlets and featured by Apple themselves in the Education category. I'm very proud of the work I've done. I can do Python (wrote a Twisted-based backend for collaborative app) and Haskell (when asked, can code on a whiteboard). I did Andrew Ng's course online last year. I REALLY can deliver.<p>At the moment, I work for a major bank in a position that drives me nuts. Everything about this job is wrong but most important is that I don't feel that I use my skills at all. I started my job hunt this spring, applied to all attractive companies I know of in London and pinged every available contact in my network.<p>The results were underwhelming. Google UK rejected me after an on-site interview. Twitter UK were hiring for a very relevant position but listed Scala as a requirement  I wrote a small RE matcher in Scala in a few hours and sent the code and my resume directly to their engineering manager whose contact I got from my network. No reply. Facebook UK and Amazon UK didn't want to even do a screening interview with me. 90% of other companies didn't bother replying. As a net result I got one offer from a startup I liked but refused it because I didn't feel we're on the same wavelength with the founder who interviewed me.<p>I'm pretty desperate at this moment and feel that I'm doing something wrong. If you're running a cool software company, what do you think a senior guy from a major bank must write in his resume to stop you from shredding it on the spot? Thank you for any advice.",1347826263

Sure some people pursue music because they want to be rich rock stars, but lots of people make music because they like making music.<p>In earlier days, it was easy to play live (and not make much money), but expensive to record anything, much less get that recording out to people. Nowadays, it's very affordable to record things as well, and trivial to upload to YouTube, SoundCloud, etc. Of course, the chance that more than a vanishingly small number of people will listen to your recording is still extremely low, but the barrier is notoriety, not the means of production and publishing.<p>And yeah, part of the rise of electronic music is because it has the lowest barrier to getting started and making your music -- just like the rise of guitar bands came partially because it was inexpensive to put together a small rock group relative to some other kinds of music, and the rise of hip hop came partially because even poor kids had access to two turntables and a microphone.",1347825882

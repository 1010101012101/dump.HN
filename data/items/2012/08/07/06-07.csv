4349019,comment,4347985,4348886,2,0,Someone,,,"<i>""Encryption and backup. [...] If people did these things correctly, hacks would rarely matter [...] This is a field that is ripe for system-level disruption""</i><p>Encryption and backups set in stone. An attacker may not be able to read your encrypted backups, but if he can delete them, you still won't be happy.<p>I think the only feasible solution is that of online, write-only backups. They need to be online so that devices can backup themselves when they deem that necessary; you cannot trust users to do any manual backup task. They need to be write-only because, otherwise, with online backups, an attacker could wipe all your backups. Semi-write only, in the form of ""deleting backups older than a year"" or ""delay any deletes by a month"" (to give the user time to report his phone to be stolen) or ""delete only after three-factor authentication"" probably is acceptable.<p><i>""perhaps because the business models of companies are now so dependent on reading our information and selling it back to interested parties""</i><p>I think it is because online backup looks too pricey. People keep comparing the price of online storage to that of hard disks. For example Dropbox is about $1 per GB of storage per year. You can buy a SSD disk or a laptop for less than $1 per GB of storage. As this example shows,  current solutions also do not protect well against attacks.<p>I am not sure that the options of having your own cloud, or of making a cloud with others (peer-to-peer backups) will make sense to Joe consumer. Users may not want yet another device at home, likely will not have the upload bandwidth (yet), and are a risk factor with respect to operations on such a device. A home device probably would have to be a custom device, not a PC. Users cannot be trusted to operate it in ways that keeps their data secure, so you must make it impossible for them to operate it.",1344322109

Let me explain the problem (that I documented to a friend ~1 month ago): I just revoked all Google Chrome keys, cleared out all of my history / cookies / passwords / forms, etc.<p>I went to a different computer that had previously had Chrome synced using ASP, switched to my account, and went to settings.  At the top, I get this error message: ""Account sign-in details are out of date. Sign in again""  That's good since ASP was revoked.  But then I go down to advanced settings => passwords, and they're all still visible?!?!  That's just WRONG!

The company has a core product that is showing great growth.  That in turn leads to even more ambitious goals.  The value from the above allows the company to offer generous perks.  Life is good.<p>Then what happens?  The core product begins to plateau.  Executives begin to abandon long-term, ambitious projects, in order to squeeze more juice from the lemon to hit quarterly goals.  Finally, perks are cut because it's just way too lavish to have free soda when you're only growing profit 33% year over year instead of 100%.  As the OP indicated, the employees are no longer left with any stories.  You may still enjoy your day to day work, you may still be well compensated in terms of salary.  But without that intrinsic motivation, it's only a matter of time before your enthusiasm flags and you're looking for another job that can offer you what you had before.<p>For company leaders, products plateau and nobody is successful all the time.  But goals and perks <i>are</i> under their complete control, and especially for the latter, it usually requires only as nominal amount of money.

I haven't seen the threat of application specific passwords (ASP) addressed properly. If an ASP is sniffed or somehow extracted from a device it seems like it's practically equivalent to a single-factor authentication password. I couldn't determine from Google's docs if an ASP will allow you to change a master password or not. Or if it could be used in the place of a master password.

You are right that this requires a significant amount of storage space, however, as you also pointed out, this will get cold quickly and be sitting on disk only (i.e. not taking up space in the valuable cache). The reason this is very efficient is because of the time-based vertex centric index we build for the stream edges. This allows us to quickly pull out the most recent tweets for any user. If we had to compute those at query time, we would have to traverse to each person followed, get their 10 most recent tweets and then merge those in-memory. That would be significantly more expensive and since stream reading is probably the most frequent activity on twitter, pre-computing it saves a lot of time at the expense of inexpensive disk storage.",1344320167

10905886,comment,10905118,10905118,0,0,LukeHoersten,,,"In open source communities, impactful contributions yield influence. Here are the top 100 bitcoin contributors:\n<a href=""https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors</a><p>Guys like Wladimir, Pieter, Gavin, Cory Fields, Gregory Maxwell and Luke Jr have a voice because they’ve contributed many thousands of lines of code. (Lines of code are only a proxy for impact).<p>You may have noticed Mike Hearn isn’t in the top 100 contributors list. He is the primary author of the Java implementation of a bitcoin library:\n<a href=""https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj</a><p>He started it in 2011, definitely early. But a substantial amount of bitcoin core work had already set the path. There are also similar implementations in many different languages but they are not the primary reference implementation for full nodes.<p>According to Hearn’s blog post:\n“I’ve talked about Bitcoin on Sky TV and BBC News. I have been repeatedly cited by the Economist as a Bitcoin expert and prominent developer. I have explained Bitcoin to the SEC, to bankers and to ordinary people I met at cafes.”<p>Being cited by journalists is not the same as being a primary contributor.<p>The disagreement between Hearn and the other developers isn’t about whether to increase capacity, it’s about <i>how</i>. Many of the primary full-node contributors believe a hard-blockchain-fork is a risky approach. Lots of work is being done to explore better options, like segregated witness (<a href=""http://gavinandresen.ninja/segregated-witness-is-cool"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gavinandresen.ninja/segregated-witness-is-cool</a>).<p>Mike Hearn tried to (very aggressively) push the idea of increasing the block size with a hard fork. In fact the patch allows node operators to vote and 75% adoption is needed. When it looked like that wasn’t going to pan out, he created Bitcoin XT where “Decisions are made through agreement between Mike and Gavin, with Mike making the final call if a serious dispute were to arise.”<p>So the claim that Hearn not being able to take over decision making power for the bitcoin community is evidence that bitcoin has failed seems to show something slightly different. It shows that open source software methodology of forking and adoption lets the best implementation win and prevents hostile takeovers.<p>Mike Hearn is not as impactful to bitcoin development as he or recent news would indicate. Mike leaving the bitcoin community has little impact on the future success or failure of bitcoin.",1452815967

Cash can be counterfeited. Even some bank wires can be clawed back. Bitcoin works as a payment mechanism.<p>On average, an electronic transaction on your credit card will not be visible to the consumer for one or two days, depending on the merchant. This can be delayed if the merchant and all other parties are taking in a large volume of transactions, but it will show up. Other reasons include allowing for modifications to the transaction (such as merchants who wish to include tips which is a manual process), but if the transaction is electronic, it will appear visible to you within a day or two.<p>With EMV being in place in the majority of the world and also ignoring some of its security problems, merchants don&#x27;t have to be concerned about a fake credit card being used as much as they once had to.<p>With Bitcoin, the merchant won&#x27;t be able to tell if the transaction is approved without having to wait an onerous and unpredictable amount of time. If this is a restaurant, are we to expect that the person who&#x27;s paying with Bitcoin will wait for the transaction to be received on the other end?<p>Credit card transactions run in the realm of 100,000,000,000 transactions per year globally [1], or 274,000,000 per day, or 3,200 per second. At best as of this current writing, Bitcoin can handle anywhere between one to three transactions per second. A delay of one or two days of a transaction on my Visa card to show a meal I had a restaurant is acceptable considering the volume per day, but being that Bitcoin takes anywhere between a few minutes to a half-day to just process the transaction when it operates at <1% the speed is just pathetic.<p>You cannot tell me with a straight face that compared to credit cards Bitcoin is able to scale and act as a &quot;[workable] payment mechanism&quot;.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.paymentssource.com/statistics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paymentssource.com/statistics/</a>",1452815894

That means those people already have a user account, know how to check out your code, are able to file issues, and can probably make contributions even if they&#x27;re not very familiar with git, for example using one of the GitHub integrated GUIs that will handhold you through making a PR. If you are an odd-duck project using some other infrastructure you don&#x27;t have any of these advantages, and the barrier to entry for potential contributors is correspondingly larger.<p>For users having a near-monoculture of source code hosting has all the same advantages but reversed; it means they only need a single account, and that every process they learn — all of which are well documented across the web — is fully transferable between projects. It also gives them a recognised place to show off their own code, and increasingly people are asking for a link to a GitHub profile as part of a hiring process. This even happens at Mozilla, an organisation that doesn&#x27;t actually use GitHub for its most prominent projects (but increasingly does for new things; the advantages I mention here are valuable even when you already have everything set up for using something else).<p>Another benefit enjoyed by projects that use GitHub is the plethora of tools designed to integrate with it; again little to do with the intrinsic merits of the tool and everything to do with network effects (although I will allow that the API is generally very good). So if you chose an alternative to GitHub you might miss out on IDE integration, Travis, landscape.io, reviewable.io, or any number of other third party tools that either exclusively work with GitHub or have smoother integration in the case of such a well-worn path.<p>Tools like reviewable.io are interesting because they are clearly making up for deficiencies in the GitHub platform itself. In that case it&#x27;s the totally, utterly, useless code review functionality in stock GitHub. And there are many other things in the site that could stand to be improved. For example the notification system that either spams you with every comment from a repo or ensures that you miss anything you don&#x27;t check via the web UI. The permissions system that makes it impossible to add commits to a PR against your own repository without losing all the metadata associated with the PR. The issue tracker that doesn&#x27;t allow assigning issues to anyone other than a project admin. But, from a business point of view, none of these things matter because GitHub isn&#x27;t popular for being the best. It&#x27;s popular for having been good enough for long enough to become ubiquitous, and now not being so bad as to negate the enormous network effects.<p>So the core of the problem here is not whether or not the authors, or anyone else, can build a better GitHub. The problem is that even if they could it would have to be wildly, dramatically, better to even provide competition. And so people, without meaningful leverage, resort to writing open letters and hoping that they can drum up enough noise that someone at GitHub chooses to care.",1452815253

Gavin should&#x27;ve kept control. Bitcoin is learning exactly why a strong central authority is so desirable in money exchange: it keeps the value of the currency stable by preventing panic and confusion over issues like this.<p>Many discussions of Bitcoin claim that this power is transferred to &quot;the network&quot; to make the final decision, which sounds very egalitarian and democratic, but Bitcoin failed to provide the controls that would prevent power hoarding and ensure that the people who depend on bitcoin were fairly represented. This is one reason why modern democracies are structured within the framework of a republic. This is probably one of bitcon&#x27;s hardest to solve problems, since the hardware to get respectable hashrates is unobtainable for quite literally everyone who doesn&#x27;t have access to their own microfabrication facilities. Even if one of the specialty bitcoin hardware makers had a really good, cheap chip, why would they share it? They&#x27;d hoard all the hashpower for themselves. Litecoin attempts to address this by hasing with scrypt, under the belief that it&#x27;s harder to hoard power with custom hardware if the algorithm uses a lot of processing power <i>and</i> memory instead of just a lot of processing power.<p>Mike failed to mention one incentive that exists to prevent increasing the block size: miners get the transaction fees attached to each block they mine. If the block size is large, there is little contention for space in the blocks, and ergo there is not much reason to incentivize miners to include <i>your</i> transaction in the next block. By keeping the artificial constraint on the block size, people who own a lot of hash power will be gaining a lot more bitcoin for themselves.<p>I don&#x27;t think this crisis is insurmountable. So much money has been sunk into bitcoin that I can&#x27;t believe people are just going to let this cabal take it out. BitcoinXT will gain notoriety through the mainstream press and the resultant sell off among casual investors will freak the big players out and force them into running XT nodes.",1452815015

Not in principle, on the fundamental-rights level. If you created something and gave it away, you should lose control over it, period. This is the only way society can develop itself - it&#x27;s how new art is created (&quot;every artist copies&quot;), it&#x27;s how science is being made (&quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot;).<p>Secondly, let me explore your example of telling a secret. If you tell a secret to someone, and then someone goes behind your back and tells the secret to me, then your gripe is not with me - it&#x27;s with the person you told the secret to. Similarly with piracy, I&#x27;m not downloading the content from your servers. Someone else is offering it to me. It&#x27;s not my duty to ask where did he get that information from. Please, if you must, go after that someone else.<p>Now I understand the need to control some of this behavior in order to make it easier for people to pay for their food by creating information. But let&#x27;s be clear about it - as a society, we&#x27;re doing it as a favor to the creator. He&#x27;s not <i>entitled</i> to copy rights, it&#x27;s a gift that&#x27;s meant to encourage people to spend their time creating instead of earning money in another way. It&#x27;s a side effect of scarcity economy. In a world where one doesn&#x27;t have to pay for basic living expenses, there&#x27;s little to no reason to have such control on information copying. If you created it and gave it away, it&#x27;s no longer yours.<p>Now so that we&#x27;ve established (just assume it even if you disagree) that the whole IP thing is just a side effect of our economy, it follows that:<p>- one should <i>not</i> be trying to make a moral issue out of it, beyond making sure the content creator isn&#x27;t completely screwed - but that&#x27;s because of basic human decency<p>- like with all other negative side effects of economy, we need to fix it<p>Which means, it&#x27;s the IP, not piracy, needs to go away.",1452814575

10905658,comment,10905118,10905118,0,0,afreak,,,"This was posted in the duplicate thread:<p>================================================<p>There are three types of people who are into Bitcoin:<p>1. People who are in it out of sheer curiosity.<p>2. People who are in it to get rich quick.<p>3. People who have been scammed into it.<p>The people who are in it out of curiosity are the people I don&#x27;t take issue with. At its beginnings, I found Bitcoin to be a curious thing because it was a novel and new idea. However, as things progressed and I learnt more about how it all worked, I saw it as a cumbersome idea that wouldn&#x27;t effectively replace anything and as a result now I&#x27;d rather make jokes about it than take anything about it seriously. I&#x27;ve never spent more than $20 CAD on Bitcoin and I have gotten it all back for that matter too.<p>People who get scammed into Bitcoin typically get scammed either one of two ways: they&#x27;re either being coerced into using it because they&#x27;ve gotten something like malware on their machines (CryptoWall and its variants) or they see it as an investment alternative. The only times I&#x27;ve ever seen non-technical people experience Bitcoin is when I have to tell them that the malware on their computers will only release their unbacked-up data requires a payment using the cryptocurrency to get it all back. And that is really what a non-technical person&#x27;s experience with Bitcoin is going to be: it&#x27;s a way to pay thieves.<p>As for the get rich quick people, they tend to fall into the third category or they themselves are scammers.<p>Right now there are two forces dominating the Bitcoin community: the miners and those who are holding out on whatever magical unicorn rainbows makes the coins have value. The miners don&#x27;t want to see changes to the software because it&#x27;ll hurt their bottom line and the people holding and exchanging it want to see these changes so they can benefit. So as a result, Bitcoin has entered a war of attrition and is starting to show its problems. Mike Hearn&#x27;s leaving is definitely a consequence of this problem.<p>Earlier yesterday [1], I made a quip about how it&#x27;s insulting to suggest that we get those who are &quot;unbanked&quot; as a result of living at no-fixed-address (ie: &quot;homeless&quot;) should eventually move on to Bitcoin as an alternative to mainstream financial institutions. It&#x27;s really for the reasons that Hearn made: would you want to wait a random period of time ranging from maybe a few minutes to a few hours for your transaction to go through? It&#x27;s already insulting enough that they&#x27;re living at the bottom of society, so why would we want to get them to use a bottom-tier financial system? Why not instead suggest making it easier for them to participate within mainstream banking schemes?<p>I anticipate based on my last remarks that the responses to this post will consist of feckless anecdotes and pointless accusations that I and others have a &quot;problem&quot; with Bitcoin. I guess to a certain extent the statement of me having a problem is true, but at the end of the day Hearn is right.<p>Bitcoin is a failure and if you invested into it then you&#x27;re getting what you deserve. If you think that it isn&#x27;t a failure then you obviously didn&#x27;t comprehend Hearn&#x27;s writing.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10898408"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10898408</a>",1452814221

It&#x27;s one of the reasons I enjoyed Jacques Barzun&#x27;s <i>From Dawn to Decadence</i>, a sprawling historical account of western civilization from 1500~2000.  He deliberately de-emphasizes the exact dates of things, aiming more to show the significant events within the surrounding &quot;mood&quot; of the general time and place in which they occurred.  Barzun also emphasizes that &quot;a reader of history must be a reader of histories&quot; due to the perspective or bias that any writer of history is bound to impart upon the work, just as the author suggests.<p>While I found the second chart showing lifespans as vertical bars to be interesting, I think that it doesn&#x27;t quite do what the author set out to do.  I can see that these three or four people were alive at the same time, but it doesn&#x27;t so much help me to understand how what person A did might have influenced person B to do whatever it was they are remembered for, or even if the influence was the other way round.  A might have been a late bloomer and B a prodigy.  With lives frequently spanning half a century or more, there&#x27;s a lot of room for interpretation.  I am not complaining: this is an interesting proof of concept.  It could be improved, I think, by adding additional markers to the lifelines for each person&#x27;s achievements, and also perhaps having by bands of color in the background showing large-scale events such as wars, disasters, etc.  Of course then you&#x27;d get into the mess of sorting out e.g. how much influence a war between England and France had on contemporary events in Germany, possibly necessitating more complications in the visual display.<p>In fact upon first seeing the lifeline chart, I thought of Barzun&#x27;s big book and how handy it would be to have an interactive version of the chart where I could click on a lifeline, or a defining moment, and be shown the relevant section(s) of the book, or really any number of books.  In that respect it would function as sort of an index for finding specific historical events and understanding their surrounding contexts.  If I were a technically-minded historian working today, I&#x27;d set my sights on implementing something like this.  A visual, clickable exploration of history seems like something lots of people would get into.",1452812874

But I find it interesting.  Again, the core is good.  It&#x27;s just curious to watch it so closely and not see the needle moving in any perceptible way.",1452812530

Still, I agree with these criticisms of GitHub. I hate +1 spam enough to delete such comments. Sometimes I even ban those who do it. I&#x27;m frustrated by people who open idiotic issues[2][3][4][5]. I procrastinate on bad pull requests because my options are:<p>1. Close the PR with little or no comment. People then think I&#x27;m an asshole.<p>2. Spend hours explaining why the code is terrible and why it can&#x27;t be improved. In addition to being a big time sink, PR submitters often don&#x27;t understand the criticisms. Half the time, they still think I&#x27;m wrong.<p>People even defend stuff as obviously wrong as adding a thousand lines of GPL&#x27;d code to an Apache-licensed project.[6] Then they say I should remove .gitignore support from ag because it doesn&#x27;t implement 100% of .gitignore syntax. As if users would be happier with tons of extraneous results instead of some extraneous results.<p>A lot of this is cultural, but GitHub could help steer things in a better direction with the features proposed in this letter.

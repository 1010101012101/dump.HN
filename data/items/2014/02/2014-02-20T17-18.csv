They were leaps and bounds above any other bank in everything from their down-home attitude to their evening and weekend hours. Then they got acquired.<p>Things weren&#x27;t too different with ING Direct. Joined up for their interest-bearing checking and used them as my savings account. Had wonderful experiences. Then they got acquired.<p>Tangential, but relevant, I got HostGator as my hosting provider many years ago—they were a little company in Texas with great service and great people. I&#x27;m leaving them this month. They got acquired, and everything changed.<p>I hope this goes well for Simple. I really do. But I&#x27;m preparing myself. I know the signs to watch out for. First they&#x27;ll get an automated phone tree, and I&#x27;ll have to tell the robot what I want. Then it will get just a <i>little</i> longer to wait for a person. A couple fees will show up, nothing much, just little stuff. Tiny, unobtrusive, totally defensible, annoying policies will start taking hold. And soon, it&#x27;ll be just another online bank—albeit one with a very pretty iPhone app.<p>I hope that doesn&#x27;t happen. But I&#x27;m bracing myself anyway.",1392918514

As a packager I know the pain of having to discover the magical way a piece of code is intended to be built, tracking down its dependencies, and stringing together the means of packaging the finished product based on how the developer assembled it.<p>Some of the problems you&#x27;ll face when packaging random code:<p><pre><code>  * non-standard version numbers\n  * non-standard file paths\n  * non-standard configure/make/install routines (or none at all)\n  * custom or non-standard build/install tools\n  * lack of build/configure/install documentation\n  * lack of dependency documentation (including what versions of what dependencies might conflict)\n  * code that isn&#x27;t portable past the desktop the developer wrote it on\n  * lack of best practices in setting up multi-user permissions\n  * lack of pre/post install scripts\n  * lack of simple init scripts\n  * lack of minimal configuration files\n  * lack of pidfile, log rotation, crontab, environment, and other necessary ops functions\n  * patching code just to get them to build and install on your distro\n  * bundled, highly patched, third-party software (!!!)\n</code></pre>\nLearning to make packages is easy, but what&#x27;s even <i>easier</i> is leaving your source in a state that&#x27;s convenient for packagers of all distros to put it together with little or no effort. Here&#x27;s some suggestions on how to do this:<p>1. Make sure your code is portable. Please, try not to hardcode things; use a &#x27;configure&#x27;-type process to allow someone to override things like file paths, usernames, and other variable data. Test it on multiple architectures or distributions to see what kind of dependencies you might need to document.<p>2. PLEASE use a standard configure/make/make install method for your language, and don&#x27;t write one yourself or depend on some backwards antiquated build tool that nobody uses. Interpreted languages often have their own standard, and compiled languages often use autoconf/automake. Learn them and use them, or at the very least, make an incredibly basic Makefile. And please document the expected permissions and users (chowns/chgrps/chmods).<p>3. Make sure that you can run one command for each of the configure/make/make install steps. Make sure it can be passed options or environment variables to change the root directory to install into. Make sure your install procedure puts them all in Filesystem Hierarchy Standard paths. Make sure it works as a non-root user; the packager will add the permissions and ownership as metadata to the package.<p>4. Provide working samples of all the things your app will need. Crontabs, log rotation, pid file tracking for daemons, configuration files, documentation, init scripts, preinstall/postinstall/uninstall scripts.<p>5. For the love of god, use standard version numbers. Either X.XXXX, X.XX.XX, or X.X.X.X. Pick one and stick with it. Otherwise different distros might actually use different version schemes for their packages which confuses everyone. Please don&#x27;t include any non-numeric characters (fuck you, openssl! hex doesn&#x27;t belong in versions!!!)<p>6. Fully document your ChangeLogs. A packager needs to know that your new release now requires a newer dependency or breaks ABI compatibility, because now they have to modify the metadata of the package to specify what deps will or won&#x27;t work. Remember that users often install and uninstall different versions of different software.",1392917457

Right now the possibility of the Keystone-XL pipeline is on the president&#x27;s table, and for those of you who don&#x27;t know, the Keystone-XL pipeline will double imports of tar sands oil, thus bringing climate change to even a bigger problem than before [1].

The related changes are then grouped by topic. (&quot;git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master/topic_name&quot;)<p>Second, the reason this workflow is superior is that it requires each commit to be individually reviewed (and hopefully verified), and what ends up getting merged is a clean topic branch, with no bad commits.<p>Contrast this to the other workflow, and I&#x27;ll use GitHub&#x27;s Pull Request as the example. Typically what&#x27;s reviewed is not the individual commits on a topic branch, but rather just the diff between the tip of that branch and the merge base between it and where it&#x27;s to be merged. In this workflow the individual commits are often not even looked at. So you can have this series of commits on a topic branch:<p><pre><code>   1. Commit A\n   2. Fixup to commit A\n   3. Commit B\n   4. Commit C\n   5. Fixup to commit B\n</code></pre>\nWhen reviewing that in GitHub, you&#x27;d typically just review the total diff introduced by all 5 commits, and if it looks good, you merge all 5. Also, typically the CI system builds just 5 or the result of 5 merged into its destination branch. So now your history has the two fixup commits in it that don&#x27;t belong there.<p>With the Gerrit-style workflow the fixups never enter the main branch, since instead you&#x27;d have squashed them into their respective commits. You&#x27;d also hopefully configure your CI system to verify each commit individually.<p>Further, on a decently sized topic, I find it easier to review a series of smaller changes, vs a huge diff.<p>It should be noted that this style of reviewing individual diffs is inspired by how reviews are done over mailing lists (Linux, Git, etc).<p>That said, once all the commits on a topic have been reviewed and perfected, it is often nice to be able to see the final diff of what is to be merged. With Gerrit you&#x27;d have to do that externally (via gitweb or by downloading the topic branch and diffing it locally against its destination).<p>Have this as a feature in Gerrit proper has been discussed and is somewhat contentious among its developers - <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/repo-discuss/FBJl5wWPpd4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/repo-discuss/FBJl5wW...</a>",1392917368

That is, 200 routes will take twice as long.  1000 routes will take 10 times as long.  But maybe 100 routes is all we ever see in reality?<p>Regardless, it&#x27;s a small leap from that to using a tree.  I would like to have seen timings for that, and for larger numbers of routes.<p>Building a trie from a list of strings is trivial.  Building one from a list of regexes is not.  But you don&#x27;t need the complexity of inspecting or interpreting the regexes.<p>With a regular binary tree, you&#x27;ll need to compile multiple regexes.  The root is a regex with all urls in only two groups: (a|b|c|d)|(e|f|g|h).  If the first group is non-empty, then you move to the next node: (a|b)|(c|d).  If the second group is non-empty, then you try (c)|(d).  If the first group of that is non-empty, then the url was c.  That should be O(k * log n) where k is the length of the url and n in the number of urls.<p>The grouping method requires 10 regex matches for 100 routes.  2^10 == 1024, so the tree method can do 10 times more routes in about the same amount of work.  A million routes with a tree is only twice as hard as a thousand, or twice as hard as a hundred with chunking.  A million routes with chunking in 10,000 times harder than a hundred.<p>On the other hand, the tree requires O(n * log n) memory, where n chunks of constant size requires only O(n) memory.  Perhaps that&#x27;s significant.<p>edit: misplaced asterisks triggered italics.<p>edit2: Actually, you don&#x27;t even need to add or check groups.  At each node you only need to combine half the regexes into one with no outer group.  For example, the top node regex from above could be just a|b|c|d.  If it matches, go to the left node (which is just a|b).  If it doesn&#x27;t match, go to the right node (which is just e|f).  As an edge case, the right-most tip node will all need to have a regex to distinguish between it and non-matching urls.  This also makes it easier to dynamically add routes without recompiling the whole tree.  Just add the route to the right side of each node, which requires no work until you get to the rightmost tip.  Occasionally rebalance.  Is dynamically modifying the routes something that people do?",1392916436

7271942,comment,7271704,7271882,11,0,kohanz,,,"Yes, Vancouver housing is incredibly overpriced. Perhaps more-so than the Bay Area because wages have kept up even less (supposedly due to Vancouver&#x27;s desirability as a destination). That doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t good, well-paying jobs there, but on average, wages in Vancouver are much lower than, say Toronto.<p>As for the racism aspect, I think the choice of word is a bit hyperbolic. That being said, as a Canadian who has lived and worked in SV, I think there are major differences between the way visible minorities are integrated in Canadian and American society. California is probably one of the less jarring transitions for a Canadian (fairly liberal society), but even then, you can&#x27;t help but notice. Note that I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s better or worse (that is a matter of opinion), but that it&#x27;s just very <i>different</i>.",1392915848

It&#x27;s really THAT stupid. These are Nazis, they are not people with whom you can reason. Not to mention the message you are sending to others: <i>I wanna come to power no matter what, I&#x27;ll do whatever it takes (rape, kill, steal, etc) to stay there</i>. So you&#x27;re no better than the current ones, you might even be worse.<p>> And Ukraine is not a battlefield created by super-powers. Super powers only aligned with the sides after it erupted. And people don&#x27;t give a shit about them anyway.<p>Do you know what are you even talking about? You think Klitschko and Yatsenyuk being in Berlin 24 hours before the mess, is just a coincidence. It might be, but I can&#x27;t believe it. I&#x27;ll go with the <i>conspiracy</i> that they got full support from Germany and USA and they decided that it was time to use guns. The fact that other forces, which are not controlled by the opposition weighted in, is irrelevant. I mean, THEY are the irrelevant part, not the other way around.<p>> People are just fed with corruption and criminals in power, all the political fighting is secondary here, despite Russian propaganda efforts to paint it otherwise.<p>And what exactly to propose for people to do: Overthrown the government not by elections but by force? This gave (actually already did happen) the excuse to USA, EU and Russia to weight in. We might even see an armed conflict there, as we saw in Syria.<p>The thing is that you can&#x27;t fight fire with fire, because you&#x27;ll get burned. Of course the largest part of the population - no in Ukraine, everywhere - can not see the big picture until it&#x27;s too late. History repeats itself.<p>I feel for the people, I agree that both sides are equally corrupted but I don&#x27;t think violence is the answer. It will only make things worst.",1392915834

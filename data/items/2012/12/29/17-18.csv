4982785,comment,4982416,4982416,3,0,larrys,,,"""I want to explore flying to an industry conference as a sales channel for AR""<p>Have you ever considered direct mail or advertising in industry trade journals? Or issuing press releases for those trade journals which are always looking for material to fill their pages? Another thought (cheaper than flying) would be to simply write a few articles for those journals speaking about the general problem of appointment reminding and then having the byline be you. It is something that others are doing. The same article could easily be repurposed for different journals. Once you are ""published"" you can then do reprints of your articles to DM or hand out at shows if that ends up being an attractive route.<p>In looking for an example of ""card packs"" which I have successfully used (in a different business) I came up with this which illustrates the direct mail route:<p><a href=""http://www.behance.net/gallery/Post-Card-Mailer/828394"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.behance.net/gallery/Post-Card-Mailer/828394</a><p>Cost to spray something like this to 10,000 offices is no big deal.

Could it be those factor(s) that results in better employment opportunities rather than the degree itself?<p>A few points come to mind: (1) Access to money makes going to school and finding work easier. (2) A ""go-getting"" attitude makes successful completion of college and finding work easier. (3) Living in the right location (namely cities) makes going to college and finding work easier. (4) Simply being lucky makes the successful competition of college and finding work easier.<p>If you could find two people who are exactly equal in every single way, except the piece of paper in hand, would you find any employability differences between them? I'm highly skeptical that you would.",1356803961
4982783,comment,4979938,4981926,1,0,hluska,,,"My experience with self help books is quite similar to my experience with people who read ""Learn how to program"" books. Some people go into the book with a head full of steam, but they give up as soon as things get hard. Other people start with the same enthusiasm, but they push through the difficult parts and (eventually) become great programmers.<p>The best educational materials I've ever read always start from the perspective that what you're about to learn is freakishly hard and it will take hard work to gain even a modicum of skill. Tragically, writing that on the cover of a book would likely kill sales.<p>As a reader though, I like to remind myself that I'm embarking on a voyage of learning, not one of already knowing. I remind myself that this is going to take a whole lot of work and that I will be frustrated many times. As long as I'm willing to do the homework, I can learn how to do almost anything.<p>As for your third question, you'll find tremendous variance as people have a number of different learning styles. I'd argue that any kind of personal change would work similarly to expert performance, so I suspect that the best medium is whatever medium does the best job of encouraging deliberate practice.",1356803916

4982764,comment,4982124,4982336,3,0,ajacksified,,,"I agree with most of this - great tips. However, for almost all applications, you'll want to render on the server, and bootstrap data on the client so that the client can take over and begin rendering using something like Backbone. This can be done by dropping a big json object on the page for the client to read as it initializes it's Backbone (or any framework) application.<p>This will solve the issues you'll run into later such as<p>* SEO - search engines won't read empty pages (you can get around this with some hacks)\n* Performance - loading a full page is always much, much faster than loading half a page, downloading javascript, parsing javascript, sending off multiple ajax requests for data, and then finally rendering the first page\n* Accessibility - a version of your site that works without javascript is not only easy to build, but is easier for machine reading\n* Development cleanliness - building your site in layers (html / http only, layer on css, layer on more advanced css, layer on javascript) keeps your code from becoming too tightly coupled and is much easier to work with. Plus, this makes it much easier to work with less advanced browsers<p>It's actually quite simple to do, especially with node, where you can share functions to format data, or even run the same framework on both side if you decouple your code (Backbone's latest change to help abstract Ajax seems like a step in this direction.)",1356803509

From there to imagine someone looking at the same data (YOUR data) from within facebook, that is a jump that emotionally is very easy to take. On the other hand, even if you KNOW that the government is wiretapping everything, you don't have the emotional connection needed to see it as a danger.

You seem to regard it as some sort of insult or badge of shame, which is understandable. As I said before, privilege is something basically everyone has. In any situation it's likely that both sides have some privilege.<p>> 	\nI am fairly certain that a black woman going to a high school where 90%+ of graduates are going to university will have many more advantages in life than a white boy attending a high school where ~10% of graduates go to university.<p>Of course she would, but she would also have many disadvantages. In this example it's important to look at BOTH sides and see what sort of privilege they have.<p>> Whites do worse in America in a host of ways compared to Asians, such as educational attainment, average income, criminality, and etc<p>The reality is more complicated than that.<p>Remember privilege is about relative advantages. White men overall are doing better because not only do better than many (but not all) demographics purely in terms of group-to-group comparisons, if you take a white man versus a comparable member of another demographic they will almost always do better.<p>A white male compared to an asian male with similar educational and professional histories will earn more on average for the same job...just as men tend to earn more than women all things being equal.<p>That's why I feel comfortable making the heavily qualified statement that as a group white males are doing better. This is also why there is often a focus on white males in these discussions.<p>That said, it's important to understand that all sides will have generally have some privilege, and it's important to discuss. I'd also note this has diverged a bit from my original point, which was merely that race enters such discussions because it's relevant to the amount and type of privilege someone has.<p>So to summarize: in many ways it's meaningless and counterproductive to talk about which group has ""more"" privilege""....<i></i>however<i></i> I think in some comparisons and contexts it is possible and useful, and in those cases when talking in a general sense I think you'd have a hard time coming up with a group besides white males.",1356802998

A ""Bot pull requests"" tab. Make it passive, so it does not trigger notifications, emails or other active communication, but is available and streamlined.",1356800459

When Facebook (or anyone else) claim that they have secret group ... they are not technically secret because their secrecy is dependent upon non-technical aspect, i.e, humans.<p>BTW, the analogy of bank website isn't equally applicable because people don't hang out at their bank websites most of the time.",1356800452

Having a way to sideload apps in your device or being able to install a different OS, doesn't make grandma more likely to get malware. It's the same model Apple is using in Mac OS X, too, now.<p>Grandma will still use the same OS, and will still install apps from the app store, never knowing that she can even install apps from other places, and it will be just as easy as it if were without that sideloading option. Having the <i>option</i> to do other things doesn't interfere with any of that.<p>And even if it does change things a little in some extreme cases - but everything has its positive and negative sides. Everything. At the end of the day you have to decide which gives the greater benefit. And I think having ""open"" computing systems over completely closed ones, offers the greater benefit in the long term, just like having an open (also could be read as malware-filled, and cybercriminals-filled) Internet in the end if is of much greater benefit than having one fully controlled by the government and companies.",1356800435

If I check Facebook right now, I will have missed everything that happened in between now and the last time .. unless I scroll and scroll and scroll.<p>But if I check email right now, I can come back and see the same emails that I haven't read yet, a week later, sitting in the same approximate location.<p>Also, umm .. really, this: ""Unlike e-mail, people can join the conversation without an explicit invitation.""<p>.. just doesn't seem quite right.  Ever been on a proper listserv?<p>Actually, your observation - and don't take it wrong, but I think you got it .. not .. quite .. right - is fascinating.  You actually have it completely inverted, in my opinion - is this because you learned to use Facebook before you learned to (properly) use email?  Not trying to be offensive, but this inversion seems pretty obtuse ..",1356800406

Any sedan has more than enogh of ompf with 170Hp,  a small hatchback with 130hm, and maybe a small SUV with 190hp.<p>Right now you have so many people buying v6s and v8s with no regard for fuel efficiency.",1209164133

It's both the only supported 64-bit API, and what the iPhone uses. There are bindings for Ruby and Python, but the native language is Objective-C.

173977,comment,173493,173577,0,0,phaedrus,,,"Actually at the CS department at my university we used RateMyProfessor to avoid truly bad professors, it was not just about grades you seem to be implying.  We used it as a tool to protect ourselves as consumers from a business which was taking advantage of its customers by hiring trash and passing them off as professors.  That's not to say all the professors were like that, but the CS department was being run that way.  I'm not kidding - the school was even investigated by the FBI for the number of registered sex offenders the CS department hired as instructors.<p>So it was more like, ""OMG! dont take professor smiths class. he harasses women and the school does nothing about it.""",1209163010
173976,comment,172346,173958,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I will humbly point out that my business (Virtualmin) is the automation of systems management tasks, likewise for my hobby of the last 8+ years (Webmin).  And I still consider it an absolute deal-breaker when an OS has a lifecycle less than three years (my usual upgrade cycle is usually 24-32 months...but I like to have some wiggle room, so five years is even better).<p>So, you're right that there is value in replicating your infrastructure on your home machine and your server, and there's definitely value in building in replicate-ability from the beginning.  Nonetheless, the end-of-life of your server will catch you by surprise one day, and some security exploit will mean you have to upgrade (at least some components) under duress.  And there's nothing more stressful than doing things under duress on a production server.  It'll take years off your life.<p>BTW-I run Fedora 7 on my desktop and Ubuntu 7.10 on my laptop, and deploy to CentOS 4 and 5 on my servers, and the pain is minimal (then again, our product technically gets deployed on all of those platforms, and many more, so that cross-platform compatibility is part of what we're always testing and working on--I suspect if platform-leveling weren't part of our value I'd be more likely to standardize).",1209162983

173959,comment,173836,173949,0,0,phaedrus,,,"Amen!  I optimize incrementally; sometimes when you're writing something you can tell it will be CPU-intensive or I/O intensive.  You don't know how much, but you optimize it enough so that it is at least up to par with the rest of the code.  It's definitely no good to leave all performance consideration to the end of the project, anymore than it would be to leave debugging to the end, and for some of the same reasons.  If you have an algorithmic problem that kills performance, it might be too late to change the code to fix it.  Plus, just as one bug can hide another, many performance problems won't show up if another, slower problem is overshadowing it.  You have to keep a basic level of speediness to the code as its under development in order to spot sudden changes in overall performance.",1209161204

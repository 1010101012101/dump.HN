Has biomedical research done such a poor job of marketing itself that people are basically clueless about what's possible, or is this just another example of routine technological illiteracy?",1201298317

The possibility that it would work well seemed dubious at first, but I've been pleasantly surprised with the results.<p>Email me at johnwehr@gmail.com - I'd be happy to discuss the technology and progress I've made so far.",1201297377

He doesn't propose that QM is the explanation.  In other words, he believes consciousness is not computable and uses QM to fight against the argument that ""the universe is computable, consciousness is a part of the universe, therefore consciousness is computable"".",1201297094

Then, if someone happens to see me using said tool, I think ""maybe i can get other people who would also use this"".<p>And it happens.  It's wonderful.

At that point, they looked a lot more like this - <a href=""http://www.motorola.com/mot/image/15/15326_MotImage.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motorola.com/mot/image/15/15326_MotImage.jpg</a><p>Some of that stuff was funny, but why pad the list?",1201295421

104339,comment,104063,104272,0,0,stcredzero,,,"> Do you really think ""faster"" is what's most important?<p>As I said before in the thread, over 90% of the time, no.  Actually, more like 98%, no, so we are in agreement about nanoseconds.  I only included the quip about performance for completeness.<p>True, the array indexing code is much shorter.  That can be worthwhile.  If your project has gotten to the point that these sorts of things are actually worth your time pursuing, then you're doing very well.<p>But that would mean that all your bugs are fixed, there are no more pressing architectural issues, and there are no highly demanded bits of new functionality to implement.  In other words, your project would be practically dead.<p>Reducing a 600 line subsystem to 100 lines would be a big deal.  Reducing 12 lines to 2?  Nope.  It runs.  Reducing 12 lines to 2 in 500 different spots around your codebase?  Well, if that's the case then I'm sorry that you have to put up with that all over the place, but at least it's correct.  Again, if your highest priority is cleaning up stuff like that, then you probably have it easy.  Too easy.",1201295337
104338,comment,104319,104319,0,0,boucher,,,"Favorite sentence: ""There is no doubt that overzealous scripters have built applications that stretch the limits of JavaScript...and in some cases, reason.""<p>We're quite proud to be stretching the limits of reason :-)<p>But in all seriousness, this is a decent explanation of the difference between a web page and a web app.  Very few people writing things on the web today <i>need</i> javascript, and designers of such sites should ensure that their pages do degrade gracefully.  If you're building an application of some reasonable level of complexity, however, it's probably okay to leave those unwilling to join the javascript party behind.",1201295235

104334,comment,104284,104284,0,0,webwright,,,"Spend 1 full day researching SEO ranking factors and adjusting your site.  Unique titles, meta descrptions, and link names will multiply your organic traffic dramatically.  Hugely.  If you want to make a business out of this, you should really be SEO experts.<p>You should also have categories (even if they are derived by keywords in the content), which you should display on your solved  solutions page.  This will reduce the number of ""clicks"" a search engine spider has to do to get to the full solution pages.<p>Bonus, have lateral linking to categories and other problems.  So if I'm on a bug for rails, you should have a ""view all bugs about rails"" link that goes to a list view as well a few links to common rails bugs.",1201294833

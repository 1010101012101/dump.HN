I've flown _a lot_ (so much that I have my frequent flyer status for life on at least one airline) and I think that being pleasant, having phone numbers to hand, knowing schedules, hand luggage only and taking action when things go wrong are all really important.   Also, I prefer to check in online and print my boarding pass (that also gives you the opportunity to hack the boarding pass and go through the first class security line).",1207042244

I don't follow it at all, (I don't like to spend money on clothes that will be outdated in 3 months), but I like to see what the trends on the street are, questioning them and if I like some idea taking it. Fashion is a very dynamic, always changing, and quite unpredictable concept.<p>What do you demand on something to be interesting?",1207041434

You can write RSA for example in a couple of hours if you already have BigInt implemented. The hard part is the math behind the algorithms that makes them work and be secure, but thats what we have Schneier for...<p>Although I wouldn't recommend implementing them yourself, unless you have a very good reason for it, as Linus once said ""Given sufficient eyeballs all bugs are shallow"", in Cryptography that is doubly important.",1207040515

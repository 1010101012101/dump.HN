Sony is now researching similar stacked chips so we&#x27;ll probably see this idea return.<p>The innovation with the tech in the article is in the dynamic range, current CMOS sensors have a fairly limited maximum dynamic range because of the well saturation described in the article, usually around 12-14ev DR. For high contrast situations that isn&#x27;t enough, and photographers will definitely appreciate increased dynamic range, not to mention the other applications they listed, like astronomy.<p>On the display side most displays also have fairly limited DR and cannot reproduce the dynamic range in HDR images, so we end up having to tonemap images to get the perceived dynamic range back - however I think HDR monitors will break through in the next couple of years as many HDR TVs are hitting the market this year.",1439474315

A sensor site may be capable of differentiating about 12 bits worth of meaningful information, hence there&#x27;s a good argument for overshooting that in the ADC. Our eyes, even if not sensitive to more than 8 bits worth of tonal gradation, are perceiving in a logarithmic space (vs. the sensor recording in a linear space), hence extra information in the shadows can be quite good. Plus the extra bits give more room in which to tune a captured image.

For applications targeting the &quot;evergreen&quot; browsers I&#x27;ve been leaning towards CycleJS, not just because the &quot;Reactive&quot; frameworks are the new hotness, but because even in my use of data-binding frameworks like Knockout I&#x27;ve been slowly leaning more towards the &quot;Reactive ideal&quot; anyway and now that CycleJS is 1.0 and stable that looks like a good place to start these days.",1439473937

For the time being though, because of the variety of similar reports and side effects, I am considering Windows 10 an surveillance state approved operating system.<p>For example, in another HN submission where someone posted a tool to delete/disable tracking services and add ip lists to the hosts file, a user has reported startup errors. To me this indicates Windows 10 is trying to communicate even during boot without the users knowledge! That&#x27;s a big deal in my book... I don&#x27;t know about yall.<p>The one reason I have suffered the slings and arrows of Windows so long is for gaming purposes, more recently because I wanted to release my hobby side-project, a game in Unreal Engine 4, on Windows and so I have kept one of my computers on Windows 8.1.<p>Last night that machine was compromised, and despite my fairly extensive malware fighting abilities, I couldn&#x27;t get rid of it. That means a complete wipe and only moving data over that I must have, and not trusting that data, not to mention never trusting the HDD again (going to have to throw it away). I also question my bios, so I&#x27;ll need to flash bios too.<p>I run three main computers, Windows on a Asus laptop, OSX on a Mac Air, and Linux/DragonFlyBSD dual boot on a Macbook Pro 2014. I think Windows 10 just might be the excuse I need to push myself completely away from the MS ecosystem. I&#x27;ve been talking about it for years, but the power of their tie-in is not to be trifled with.<p>I also fear for the state of linux in the same way though. At >10 million lines of kernel code, I think the many eyes theory has a weakness, namely that complex and huge codebases are antithetical to the many eyes theory working. that&#x27;s why I personally think the future of computing will be in code simplicity and pairing down existing codebases. A good example of a try at this is Minix 3. <10k loc. (of course lacks many features).<p>That&#x27;s also why, even thought I&#x27;m a huge GPL/GNU guy, I am increasingly leaning towards the top down ecosystem of the BSD&#x27;s.<p>I think there are a lot of fundamental issues in personal computing that many of us just ignore and don&#x27;t want to discuss because the implications of the conclusions could be uncomfortable. I think it&#x27;s time for those of us who are considered power users to start having this difficult discussions more often and in more public ways.",1439473814

That order was issued by a court which... had to be satisfied that there was sufficient evidence giving rise to probable cause and that domestic arrest was proportionate.<p>The Swedish prosecution (a political appointee) is claiming she cannot demonstrate probable cause without interviewing Assange, and yet she refuses to interview him. Leaving aside the absurdity of any reasonable person thinking that any interview will give the Swedish authorities the smoking gun they obviously lack, from a legal standpoint the only sensible explanation for their behavior is that it allows the option of extraditing without public judicial consideration of probable guilt and proportionality of prosecution.

All stock prices are trying to predict the future not the present. With large, older, stable companies it gets easier and easier to predict the future &quot;This company is growing by 10% per year so in one year it should be worth 10% more all things being equal and its peers as a group are trading at some multiple (usually profit) so if I think it&#x27;s at that multiple (or better yet less) and I think 10% is a good return for my money over 1 year then I&#x27;ll buy some.&quot;<p>With new, rapidly growing, highly speculative companies in big markets (auto, space, energy) it becomes very difficult to predict where they&#x27;ll be in 1 - 5 years. Investors are still (typically) intelligent and will look at what other disruptive companies have done in the past, look at the management team and leadership etc and place a &quot;bet&quot; on the stock. Because these companies are sometimes growing 50% to 100% per year and someone is happy to hold a stock for 3 - 5 years they will pay a substantially high price for stock in terms of _today&#x27;s_ revenues or profits. It doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t get it wrong - ie if a company falls to growing &quot;just&quot; 40% per year that makes a huge difference 3 years out. It doesn&#x27;t mean that the stock price for the new stock is any more or less correct than for the older more stable company. it just means it&#x27;s much more likely to fluctuate over the next 3 - 5 years as risk and upside is better priced in with more knowledge in place.",1439472891

Depending on how much investment you see as being required in the future, you may or may not have predicted that they would need additional financing in the future (ie, after your investment). If you did not predict the need for additional financing, this is probably bad news for you. If you did predict it, than what matters most is how the terms of this financing compare to the terms you were expecting.

There&#x27;s more to aperture size and exposure length than &quot;how much light reaches the sensor&quot;, like focus, depth of field, motion blur and bokeh, to name a few, that is not aknowledged by that understanding. The technology is good, but it won&#x27;t change the way photographers deal with photography, at best, it will give them a better tool to work with.<p>I also wonder how much impact this could have. Foveon Inc. had developed a great sensor that was going to be revolutionary, about 20 years ago. Today only Sigma uses it, and the UX is so bad in those cameras that the (very good) technology they had their hands on never got a chance to shine.<p>Also, is this implementation very different from having a 16-bit ADC in normal sensors? The end results would be the same: higher dynamic range.

For me, &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; mean biological sex, not gender<p>Um no, my view isn&#x27;t an assumption. Gender isn&#x27;t sex. People don&#x27;t call a boy a man or a girl a woman. Maybe US western culture assumes sex = gender but the rest of the world has some form of distinction from sex (biological) and gender (social).<p>>Also, for me, a &quot;name&quot; is about the least personal thing about myself - it&#x27;s what others call me, so it&#x27;s inherently a cultural thing that depends on the social contract. For example, if you change your name without a good reason, most people would simply assume you&#x27;re trying to run away from your past or avoid justice.<p>In our US western culture a name is a name whether given or self-attributed. No one demands Prince or Madonna to give their legal names. We know them by those names in terms of their public actions. If I greet myself as Veronica it&#x27;s safe to assume that <i>is</i> my name. It doesn&#x27;t require a background check in a social setting like a party or a meetup. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m looking to get a security clearance.<p>Also, there&#x27;s no such thing as a good reason to change one&#x27;s name. You just change it for your reasons. The good and bad about it is merely a subjective valuation of the act of the change. It has no bearing in terms of the character of the person.

To secure extradition, the Swedish prosecutor needed to insist that Assange was only wanted for questioning (else they should charge) but since questioning alone is not a sufficient basis for extradition requests they also needed to state it was extremely likely Assange would be arrested once questioned.<p>It is of course nonsensical for the Swedes to refuse to question Assange in London if speaking to him were at all material to the case.

10053800,comment,10052754,10053509,0,0,mixonic,,,"Comparing framework size directly is not very meaningful. For example Bustle.com, already running Ember 2.0 today, sits at:<p><pre><code>  * 155K of vendor JS (Ember, jQuery, addons)
  * 76K of app JS
</code></pre>
Artsy.net is a universal/isomorphic JS website using Backbone. Backbone is maybe a tenth the size of Ember, maybe. Their homepage payload sits at:<p><pre><code>  * 26K jQuery
  * 6K raven JS
  * 127K analytics JS
  * 300K main layout JS
  * 274K homepage app JS
  * + stripe
</code></pre>
Now I also think Artsy does a lot more than Bustle, to be fair. However the point is that framework size is only a part of the story. The complexity of your code, how you ship it, and how concisely the framework lets you express a design are all extremely impactful.<p>Ember gives you a big bang for your buck with that 108K (a minified, gzipped 2.0). In practice not many people find this to be the main performance hurdle in their apps, but regardless we&#x27;re working toward smaller payloads (something we call &quot;svelte builds&quot;) and better initial execution performance (<a href=""https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/11576"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/11576</a>).",1439470975

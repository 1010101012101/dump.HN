Now they are adding some customization tools to go a little beyond that (and touch into more of the long tail).<p>That said, I think the Geoff fellow put it best when he commented on the post:<p>""Sure, Google is great at the tech, but they are a bit weak when it comes to building 'places'. They don't have enough touchy feely people over there to get the warms and fuzzies right. So, their sites, while they work well, all feel very cold and sterile, and don't really build a social community. That's why Google Video didn't take off and they bought YouTube.""<p>Our startup is geography-heavy, but our mantra has been 'we are not a mash-up.'  This is because we are aiming for the warm and fuzzies (serving the needs of a specific community of users), and almost all mash-ups that I've seen lack the warm and fuzzies because the Google Maps API limits their ability to custom-tailor their service and presentation.  I don't think these few new buttons greatly change that.  <p>As an aside, one of the reasons I really enjoyed Chris Anderson's speech at Startup School was his repeated assertion that one-size-fits-all solutions are (in some ways) necessarily inferior to products and services that focus on the niche.

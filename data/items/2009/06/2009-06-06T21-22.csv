At the same time, I can't help reading it partly as filler material, and partly as an excuse to bash Airbus (a fashionable choice in some parts of the media, because they're a state-funded enterprise and even worse, they're <i>French</i>).<p>I'm not carrying water for Airbus, they have had their share of problems. But it's rather unfair to point out that they also have a very good overall safety record. Of course, statistics are abstract whereas tragedies are very very personal.",1244325536

Everybody else is probably going to tell you otherwise, but perhaps you should consider a radical change in your education plans, especially if things just get worse. Maybe leaving in a couple of years and doing something more worthwhile, even if that just means going to college early.

A record label can hook someone talented up with word-class producers, session musicians and recording facilities, as well as setting up collaborations with established artists.<p>Some people can produce a great song in their home studio, but many can't. Mariah Carey has a superb voice, for example, but as far as I know she doesn't play any instruments and her interest in technology is limited to playing video games. A 360 degree deal can be a good option for a performer armed with a decent manager. The teevee and the music industry likes to lump everyone together as 'artists' but the reality is that many excellent performers aren't especially creative and just happen to be lucky enough to do something well, without necessarily being driven to explore any new musical frontiers. for this kind a of person, a managed career makes vastly more financial sense because they don't have a big prospect of making money from licensing their own tunes.",1244324651

645127,comment,644601,644659,0,0,Dove,,,"Some folks think so, but I don't.  For two different reasons.<p>The first, rational.  Some folks think science will overturn religion because (they so casually assume) religion is false, irrational, and inflexible.  Well, that's a touch easier to just assume than to actually argue with a live Christian intellectual, isn't it?  I find the viewpoint humorously arrogant, and shall return the favor: Christianity will survive because it is not only rational, but also true.  Theology and science both love truth, both pursue it through reason, and anything that is true cannot remain the enemy of either one forever.<p>The second, human nature.  Some folks think religion is nothing more than superstition, and easily overturned by education.  I think folks might find that foolish if they actually visited a church and tried it; the roots of religion in human nature are an awful lot deeper than that. The need for God, for purpose, for morality, for mythology, is a very deep and universally human thing.  Science, for all its practical success, is a pursuit for intellectuals, but the spiritual is universal.  For every cold intellectual you show me, I'll show you ten romantics, and maybe even a couple guys who answer both calls.<p>Christianity has been around for two millenia; Judaism for four or five.  Neither is going anywhere soon.  Oh, the institutions will change, the names will change, how they actually function may grow close to unrecognizable.  But folks will gather for worship and prayer as they always have, and devout mothers will pray over their children as timeless peers.  The hot theological debates will be different, but doctrine and scripture that hasn't changed in three or five millienia is not going <i>anywhere</i> in another ten.<p>It seems fashionable to pronouce religion dead at least once a century, but it's like the old knight said . . . the church of God is an anvil that has worn out many hammers.",1244322606

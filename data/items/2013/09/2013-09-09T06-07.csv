6352185,comment,6349296,6351554,3,0,xyzzyz,,,"I must have not communicated what I meant clearly, because you missed my point.<p>Only a very, very small fraction of results in number theory are applicable. Only a very, very small fraction of stuff done in algebraic topology is applicable. While descriptive set theory is indeed sometimes applied in functional analysis, the intersection between these two is not a significant fraction of each one of them, and by the time you apply (a very small fraction of) functional analysis to statistical physics, you&#x27;re already too far from descriptive set theory to even see it on the horizon.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that none of the mathematics is applicable, because this is obviously not the case. What I&#x27;m saying is that the stuff that gets applied to real life problems is surprisingly small, even more so when you&#x27;re not a mathematician.<p>When I first started to learn mathematics, I was completely overwhelmed, when I found out just how much knowledge is out there in this field of human activity. The planes of mathematics are so vast, there&#x27;s almost nothing else in sight when you stand atop of the Mount Bourbaki. I realized that even if I get a PhD in pure mathematics, I will still only be able to learn less 1% of mathematics ever created in my whole lifetime. That&#x27;s why when I hear people saying that all math can be applied, I think that they must have not realized just how much of the stuff is in there.<p>I used to specialize in algebraic topology, and when I first learned about persistent homology, I encountered a home page of the professor at some US faculty, who specialized in applying algebraic topology in real life, and the first reaction of me and my classmates whom I have shown his website was not appreciation of his results. We were totally amazed that this stuff can be applied to anything _at all_. Yeah, some of these applications were to the problems that are usually solved in a better way, some problems were very contrived and seemed to actually be tailored so that one can apply algebraic topology to them, but still these were very fine and interesting results, and we were very surprised by them.<p>The field of algebraic geometry actually makes an interesting example. Indeed, it is considered by many one of the most, if not the most abstract field of the mathematics. Initially, at the beginning of the previous century, people were mostly concerned with studying the sets of solutions of systems of polynomial equations. David Hilbert with his landmark results being his basis theorem and Nullstellensatz laid fundamentals to this field, and because of an essential assumption in the  Nullstellensatz theorem that creates a bridge between algebra and geometry, for many decades most of the results concerned only polynomials and sets of solutions in algebraically closed fields, because for anything else, the apparatus was just lacking. Algebraic geometry didn&#x27;t have a reputation of an extremely abstract field, especially since sets of solutions to systems of polynomial equations are quite natural objects, and it&#x27;s easy enough to imagine their occurrence in real life problems.<p>In 1950s and 1960s, though, the field was completely and utterly revolutionized by Alexander Grothendieck and his school, and that&#x27;s when the field gained its fame of being very esoteric. Grothendieck&#x27;s methods and approach allowed algebraic geometers to tackle vastly bigger range of problems, and ultimately to efface the distinction between algebra and geometry, at the price of making things much more abstract and distanced from more concrete considerations. That&#x27;s when algebraic geometry expanded its reach, to encompass a large amount of research in abstract algebra and number theory.<p>In the meantime, another interesting thing happened in the field: the advent of computational techniques. Things like Groebner bases really pushed things forward and made a lot of theoretical stuff actually doable in practice. This is mainly what made things you mention in your post possible: while many industry problems could be formulated in geometric terms earlier, only rise of computational methods actually allowed us to solve them.<p>The point here is this: algebraic geometry field consists of two parts, the older and more concrete, which can and is (relatively) frequently applied, and the newer, but more abstract, of which applied is very little -- with notable exceptions though being for instance finite elliptic curves with well known application to cryptography, or Calabi-Yau manifolds which are intimately connected to the string theory. Nevertheless the applied stuff constitutes only a small part of the field, the rest is just pure and abstract mathematics, without any applications whatsoever, though it&#x27;s still worth noting that algebraic geometry is still relatively very good in the amount of applicable stuff, and fields like algebraic topology, not to even mention descriptive set theory, fare much, much worse with regard to it. For me, a bit naive is to think that big part of mathematics will be applied, when there&#x27;s so much of it.",1378709470

It ill-serves society to force extremely good judges to follow poorly-thought-out laws, but the losses on that end are more than made up for by forcing the idiot and asshole judges to adhere to laws written by people who <i>aren&#x27;t</i> explicitly out to screw you over.",1378709046

It&#x27;s inspired by ideas that are quite familiar to the hacker crowd, but quite new to education: continuous improvement, forking, and open source.<p>The main problems this project addresses, and how it addresses them:<p>First problem: Most education standards are written by an external standards body, over which educators have little or no influence. Solution: Make it easy for educators to develop, maintain, and share sets of standards that they create and modify.<p>Second problem: It is difficult for a successful school to share its overall system with another school. Solution: Make it easy for one school to fork another school&#x27;s system.<p>Third problem: Most schools have one set of graduation requirements, regardless of the fact that students have widely varying interests, aptitudes, and experiences. Solution: Allow the creation of different &quot;pathways&quot; through the curriculum that students can follow to earn a diploma.<p>Fourth problem: Many ed-tech offerings these days are built more with a profit motive in mind than with the desire to foster widespread adoption of what is best for students. Solution: Commit to a fully free and open set of tools for educators and learners.<p>It&#x27;s a pilot project just for my school this year, but it is public and the source is available for anyone interested. It is also set up to be scaleable as soon as the pilot phase is over.<p>[1] <a href=""http://opencompetencies.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opencompetencies.org</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/openlearningtools/opencompetencies/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/openlearningtools/opencompetencies/</a>",1378708848

Second, desires aren&#x27;t global. Third, your backcrossing line is dubious. Biology is good at survival, we don&#x27;t need to tend to it ourselves. If we reach a state where we do, then gee golly: we&#x27;ve clearly buggered up hundreds of millions of years of success in a right jiffy!<p><i>no plant biologist would argue that breeding is the only technology that matters in feeding people. Everything from agricultural market efficiencies to post-harvest storage needs to be improved, and bettering technology is the best way.</i><p>I agree with your premise but not your conclusion. Growing suitable crops closer to where they are consumed, in greater variety, and removing external dependencies such as artificial fertilizer, unnatural water consumption for unsuitable crops, technology and energy for industrial farming, packaging and transport will also go a long way.<p>Unfortunately, it turns out that the reality is that actually helping people to get fed well and cheaply is a great way to make them consume less, reject large established business interests, and stop going to work. Therefore supporting policy is far from a priority in government.<p>[1] <a href=""http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/pages/background-goals.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/pages/background-goals.htm</a>",1378707448

6352104,comment,6349307,6350801,3,0,sockPuppetry,,,"Ah, come on. Consider what it takes to create a Yahoo! user account. Almost nothing.<p><pre><code>  Yes, I was born on January 1, 1901\n  Yes, the CAPTCHA is HU3FR43O\n</code></pre>\nWhen you&#x27;re engaging in elaborate sock puppetry, ostensibly for evil deeds, you&#x27;re going to create and dump accounts like water.<p>Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s some evil super villain plotting to derail a train, and he needs to communicate with his henchmen. If he knows that the law will stop attempting to trace his secret e-mails to his henchmen, after reaching some magic number of say... 100,000 user accounts, then his evil plan needs to incorporate operations to create maybe 500,000 sock puppet accounts, to give his communiques a 1 in 5 chance of being intercepted.<p>Now, let&#x27;s say you have special evil dedicated servers, capable of queuing and automating requests in real time, and funneling off the CAPTCHAs to warehouse filled with data entry sweatshop slaves, so that your henchmen have all of their dummy accounts prepped for use, once the plan is set to unfold. Because a lot of human intervention and human interaction can be removed from the creation of a yahoo! account, and thus automated, if our evil super villain were able to engineer a custom yahoo! account creation apparatus, it would be a mistake to assume that 40,000 accounts represents 40,000 people, much less 40,000 terr&#x27;ists, or even 40,000 &#x27;muricans.<p>So it&#x27;s not like one can make any assumptions based on these kinds of numbers, when it comes to anything on the internet. But regardless, the reverse aspect to this unreality of &quot;user accounts&quot; on the internet is the worry. There&#x27;s no way to know when government officials are being honest, and not taking advantage of their powers, to abuse them for personal gain, either to spy on a cheating spouse, or to accept bribes and do it for someone else.<p>If user accounts, as a rule are nebulous and pseudonymous, and there&#x27;s no real limit on creating them, and thus only a fuzzy integrity to them, then how can there be a predefined limit on eavesdropping?<p>The only real limit on sock puppet accounts is a theoretical one, tied to the bandwidth consumed by the circuits crossing all international boundries. In theory, if it takes &quot;X&quot; amount of time for human intervention to create a user account, and we can estimate &quot;T&quot; amount of terr&#x27;ists worldwide, then, given &quot;N&quot; amount of time lapsed since TERR&#x27;ISM A.D., there might potentially be:<p><pre><code>  ((N/X)*T) = terr&#x27;ist user accounts in the world\n</code></pre>\n...then that&#x27;s pretty much what &#x27;murican law enforcement will entitle themselves to commandeer to fight &quot;evil&quot;.<p>But even more absurd is the idea that a dragnet of all internet traffic will reveal any kind of terrorist communications at all. I would have imagined that human couriers and satellite phones were still the primary drugs of choice when it came to super villainy.",1378707425

LulzSec shotgunned the release out onto the web, where everyone picked it up, not just Brown.<p>>Let&#x27;s say further that this guy duplicates the key and mails it to a gang to do with as they will. If providing that gang access to that locker is illegal then homeboy here has certainly &quot;aided & abetted&quot; in that behavior,...<p>It isn&#x27;t illegal. LulzSec is responsible for the release. Specifically, Jeremy Hammond has been charged and convicted with the actual crime of hacking into Stratfor and releasing the material. He was facing a life sentence and received 10 years and 2.5 million dollars in restitution upon pleading guilty. The liklihood that he could ever get that restitution dropped, via bankruptcy or other means, is minimal. Financially, he has effectively been given a life sentence. Brown no more aided and abetted anyone than Cryptome or any of the other numerous actors that linked to and received the link or, heaven forbid, downloaded the material, and yet Brown is facing punishment of similar magnitude to the guy who actually committed the crime.<p>>Likewise our intrepid, noble and completely objective storywriter uses the maximum legally-possible sentence as a FUD factor without so much as a single reference to the sentencing guidelines which would be used to determine an actual eventual sentence.<p>What <i>typically</i> happens is irrelevant. It shouldn&#x27;t be possible for someone like Hammond to face life in prison, or Manning to face the death penalty, or Brown to face 105 years <i>at all.</i> To make that possible is to make a &quot;lighter&quot; sentence of 10 years for Hammond (and 2.5 million dollars), or 35 years for Manning, or 5 years for Brown, seem graciously reasonable. The constant whiny poo-pooing that &quot;they won&#x27;t really get that much,&quot; and cheeky linking to blog posts intended to inform the uninformed masses about the federal sentencing guidelines, is nothing more than noise. It truly intends to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.<p>>There is a question to be asked here: Should these types of forcibly-exfiltrated secrets have any special inherent legal protection?<p>>The answer isn&#x27;t obviously &quot;no&quot; either, by the way, otherwise our current protections against identity theft could hardly apply, not to mention the Privacy Act of 1974, medical record protections, etc.<p>It really is an obvious &quot;no.&quot; Hacking into customer databases and pilfering the contents is a crime. A crime that has been tried in court with the accused convicted and serving time in prison. Once information is out in the clear, it makes absolutely zero sense to try and claim some sort of retroactive &quot;special inherent legal protection.&quot; The protection already exists, with punishment for its violation. The crime is for putting documents into the clear, not propagating them, no matter their contents.<p>==========================================<p><a href=""http://cryptome.org/0005/stratfor-hack.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cryptome.org/0005/stratfor-hack.htm</a><p>|<p>|-><a href=""http://pastebin.com/f7jYf5Wd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/f7jYf5Wd</a><p><pre><code>   |\n\n   |->http://ibhg35kgdvnb7jvw.onion/lulzxmas/stratfor_full.tar.gz\n</code></pre>\nDo I get N decades in prison for that?

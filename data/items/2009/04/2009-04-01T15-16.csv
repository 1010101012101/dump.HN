IMHO the Big Three's obsession with out-competing the Japanese in the econo-car market contributed no small part to their demise.<p>Entire lines of ""all American"" cars were scrapped in favor of inferior ripoffs of Toyota creations. This continued well into the 2000s; look at cars like the Chevy Aveo, a Korean-made, budget econo-mobile that couldn't hold a candle to the Echo/Yaris' fuel efficiency nor reliability.<p>Ford was the first one to recover from this and reintroduce big muscle, which in the end was what the American market wanted all along (but couldn't justify).<p>I do agree on the interior point though.

Couple of months back I asked people for math books related to computer science. I got some good feedback. I bought two books a)- What's mathematics b)- Discrete Maths by Susana App. I'm nowhere near a hardcore computer science student as I'm studying on my own. However, I've been able to solve recurrences, inductions and basic mathemtical proofs. I came across this beautiful function named ""Ackerman function"" and reading it was a pleasure. I don't take care of plants in my garden because it's necessary. I just do it for pleasure, literally. Same goes for maths though I'm pretty damm sure I will never able to do maths as good as Knuth but still.
I've a long way to go. But I've ordered some books on proving theorems. I don't intend to become a hardcore mathematician but I would just like to get through this once (just for the sake of pleasure). Here is a personal story a)Once I finished basic Discrete Maths I was writing a command-line based twitter client for personal use and using their API recursion just came as a natural choice (it was so natural that I had to think of how I did it after seeing my code running--believe it or not) b)- I'm fairly confident (and cautious) when I write recursive code now. I'm , by all means, a very average programmer but I would like to think that I've improved a bit.
I agree with Djikstra that learning your own language in depth is important for non-native speakers. Learning your language in depth widens your horizon and it creates clarity of thought. At least, I think it's important though I'm still a mediocre English speaker (yet).",1238600496

As a math major, I took a lot of math courses that cross-listed with computer science or had a heavily computational component.  Anyone who has taken numerical analysis or worked through the last third of the advanced algorithms book has seen the extent of this relationship.<p>There are huge classes of differential equations that can't be solved without programming.  Same for optimization problems (the simplex method has to be one of the greatest intersections of math and programming in history).  Simulation (and not just brain-dead random number slamming) has made it possible to solve probability problems that were unsolvable a couple of decades ago.<p>So while I tend to view math as domain knowledge for a programmer - ie., an area where you apply programming (like chemistry, real estate, acounting...), the relationship seems deeper and more natural.",1238600283

To support IE7 you've already given up border-radius, display: table, automatic PNG transparency, SVG, a lot of the DOM, and a lot of the other things that make developing for other browsers so easy. With IE6, you can get a lot of the functionality of IE7 with just a little Javascript (already written for you by others), a few conditional comments, and a little extra CSS.

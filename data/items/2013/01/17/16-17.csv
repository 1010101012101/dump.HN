I agree that the incentive for mutual cooperation is not the only incentive in play; and of course that's just as true now as it was 15,000 years ago.<p><i>Law is how we scale cooperation from small bands lead by a dominant male to countries of 300 million people.</i><p>I agree with this, and I should have mentioned it in my earlier post. As you note, law was the way mutual cooperation was scaled even when it just involved cities of a few thousand people 4,000 years ago. I was only trying to point out that the incentives for mutual cooperation are logically prior to the means used to facilitate it.<p>Also, of course, scaling mutual cooperation is not the only thing law is used for; it is also used to facilitate rent-seeking and other non-cooperative behaviors. That was true 4,000 years ago as well.<p><i>You can always even greater gains by cooperating only up to the point where it's most advantageous for you.</i><p>If the interaction is non-iterated, yes. In an iterated interaction you can't--or rather, you can, but the other person will just retaliate by ceasing to cooperate, and you both will be worse off than you would have been if you had continued to mutually cooperate. See the Prisoner's Dilemma.<p>(Btw, I'm not claiming that this doesn't happen. I'm just claiming that it is not actually a gain in the long run.)",1358439683

If someone commits a crime by accident or in the heat of the moment then certain actions should be taken to explain to them their mistake(e.g. rehabilitation, imprisonment, therapy, probation).  If they make a ""pattern of behavior"" then society can conclude that society doesn't have the tools to convince the offender to end their pattern of offending, and the offender should be physically disallowed from committing future offenses in their pattern:<p>bad lawyers are restricted from practicing law - ""dis-bar-ment""<p>offending computer users are restricted from using computers",1358439558

According to the agency, natural gas drilling does not lead to the presence of biogenic methane.

Chomsky's aim is to expose the workings of this process (and no, he's not a conspiracy theorist -- he's simply pointing out naturally emergent behaviors of large institutions) arguing that if only the great unwashed were aware of what's going on they'd suddenly start participating and everything would be better.<p>But as the discussion proceeds, it really seems to be arguing that people are stupid and uninformed and like it that way, and when presented with this argument, Chomsky makes the claim that no they're smart because they can learn to talk -- which I think is weak. (It's like arguing that basketball players must be good at physics.) This leaves the original thesis -- that people are stupid and ignorant and like it that way -- essentially standing, and thus argues in favor of the entire political philosophy he's trying to take down.<p>And that's a fundamental problem with Chomsky's political philosophy, but not with his observations.

I'm doing a university degree that  is supposedly a combination between CS and business/management. For some reason, however, 99% of the students enrolled are heartbreakingly disconnected from anything CS; most of them hope to become management consultants. I've worked with those people in group projects, and trust me, they are exactly the kind of techniques junkies, who sacrifice all humane common sense [1] and become this sort of compulsive manipulators who keep tailoring their attitude towards the team to the point where it stops making any effin sense whatsoever. I am starting to think the reason why those techniques end up actually working is because they appear so convoluted and ridiculous from the outside that you're just going to comply out of confusion. Or maybe it's out of pitty.<p>[1] If we are to be rigorous, then ""common sense"" is just another technique, learned and applied. There's nothing sacred about it, so if it necessary it should be replaced with a more effective ""sense"". However, what I tried to emphasize is that the techniques like the ones in the article are very, very buggy.",1358438494

5073314,story,,,1,0,bulletmagnet,"Ask HN: Finding a tutor for front-end coding.",,"After a more than 10 year long hiatus spent in the business side of technology, I'm looking to get my hands dirty again. I used to be fairly competent in HTML/CSS/JS but I'm finding it hard to get back in the saddle again. I am reading books and taking tutorials about HTML5, CSS3 and JS frameworks like Backbone, but I find myself a bit overwhelmed by trying to learn too many things at the same time and also a bit directionless.<p>Then I remembered seeing or reading about coders earning some extra cash tutoring high school kids, and I thought that's kind of what I need: structured environment, project-based learning, one-on-one interaction - even though I am far from being a high school kid (my wife may disagree at times).<p>Have you taught coding one-on-one before? How was your experience? What are the hourly rates I should expect to pay? How to find a good tutor? If you think this would be a good gig for you, don't hesitate to contact me - I'm in NYC/Brooklyn if it matters (doing it remotely is definitely an option, but I am tending towards a face-to-face thing).",1358438443

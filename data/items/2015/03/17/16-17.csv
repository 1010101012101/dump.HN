Any event except Valentines/romance related, the behavior would have been appropriate. Specifically doing it on Valentines with the unspoken implication of he&#x27;d be alone with her and his wife would be out of town....? :/<p>> Let&#x27;s be honest. We only get a picture, one tinted by personal views and time. It will be interesting what the court digs up and how the final determination comes about.<p>Of course.

For years we&#x27;ve been told that the reason there&#x27;s no women in tech is because of all us sexist brogrammers, despite the typical programmer being the opposite of a &#x27;bro&#x27;, while the VCs very much resemble them, and somehow VCs being 96% male with most top firms having NO women as partners slips by unnoticed. VCs intentionally create frat house cultures at the tech companies they invest in because they assume it saves them money to hire misfit programmers who need a workplace to provide a social life rather than act like processionals and demand professional compensation, and that frat house culture is also antagonistic to people who aren&#x27;t young males. Finally, I don&#x27;t see how you could read a case where a VC firm made mis-step after mis-step, and a highly qualified woman suggested they invest in winners like Twitter only to be ignored, and brushed off for invites to the Democrats the VCs are in bed with like Al Gore, and not see how she clearly as an extremely strong case of gender discrimination against a rich and powerful sect of elite VCs who have hidden their sickening behavior in the shadows for far too long.",1426611500
9219342,comment,9217383,9219157,0,0,eridius,,,"Square-Enix actually have a bunch of games on the iOS App Store. Most of them are ports, but a while back there was the Chaos Rings series which was original IP (I haven&#x27;t checked if they have any other original IP for iOS). And they&#x27;re not just straightforward ports either, for example the Dragon Quest games have all been adapted to play in a portrait layout (because their target customers are Japanese people playing while standing up on subway cars, where they can&#x27;t do two-handed landscape gaming).<p>I also find it notable that Square-Enix is maintaining relatively high price points for these games (such as $15), and have done so for years, despite the iOS game market still being primarily aimed at the $1-$3 level. Of course, the fact that the games are being published by a well-known name like Square-Enix lets them do things other companies couldn&#x27;t get away with, but it must be profitable enough because they keep adding more games to their iOS lineup.",1426611495

9219334,comment,9218114,9218987,0,0,davidw,,,"> understand the hate for GPL<p>Here&#x27;s an attempt, although before I start, I don&#x27;t hate the GPL at all.  I think it&#x27;s a clever hack, and a good license for some situations. Sometimes, as a practical matter, it is annoying:<p>Sometimes, you work on proprietary code (as to why this is, here&#x27;s one thing I wrote a few years back: <a href=""http://journal.dedasys.com/2007/02/03/in-thrall-to-scarcity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.dedasys.com/2007/02/03/in-thrall-to-scarcity/</a> but it&#x27;s a long, involved discussion in and of itself!) and would like to integrate some small library that would make your life easier.  If you can&#x27;t use it, it&#x27;s not really that big a deal, but if you can, great.  Someone like myself, who greatly enjoys open source software will also be sure to be a &#x27;good citizen&#x27;, giving back any changes to that little library, even if we&#x27;re not forced to.<p>But if it&#x27;s GPL, you just can&#x27;t use it.  If this is the genuine intent of the author, fair is fair and you move on.  Sometimes though, people just slap the GPL on stuff without particularly considering the consequences.<p>In some circumstances, BSD licensed code can attract more users, <i>because</i> they are able to use it in proprietary applications.  If they &#x27;get&#x27; open source, they&#x27;ll still contribute back, causing the code to actually be more used and useful than if it were GPL and excluded from use by a company creating something it wants to make money with. (Ok, yes, you <i>can</i> make money with GPL stuff, but it&#x27;s a lot more difficult than making money by simply selling something directly, and even that is not <i>easy</i>, as anyone who has tried to start a software business knows).",1426611443

9219317,comment,9219162,9219162,0,0,angersock,,,"I came in expecting to read an article bemoaning some niche language and playing the diversity card. I was not disappointed, but as I kept reading, the author made some very good points.<p>I don&#x27;t really care that the organization is run by white men who speak English, because frankly the entire computing industry and telecommunications industry is based on that. I&#x27;m not going to argue about the original sin there, because the facts speak for themselves: they got shit done.<p>What I <i>do</i> find really disturbing, though, is that somehow both Linear A and Linear B are included, in their (as known) entirety, while Bengali is not--two languages spoken and written by nobody for over a millenia are included whereas a language spoken and written by millions of people is not. That&#x27;s bad.<p>The discussion of somehow creating a CJK superset and then deviations to support each of those languages is worse, and the author&#x27;s remark about trying to &quot;unify&quot; Greek, Roman, Cyrillic, and Swedish struck home.<p>Personally, I think that it&#x27;s nice to have an ever-decreasing number of languages to support, preferably English. The first part of that is because it&#x27;s annoying enough to unambiguously parse one human language much less dozens, and the second part is pure convenience and small-mindedness on my part.<p>That said, we don&#x27;t have to buy into diversity or identity or anything else to note that something here is amiss. This is bad allocation of engineering resources.<p>EDIT:<p>And yes, one could make the argument that the computer/teleco industry is being produced in Shenzhen, to which I would respond that the intellectual capital was handled by the West. Nintendo hired SGI, Sony IBM. There is certainly a wonderful and burgeoning domestic talent, but the paths were set elsewhere, to the best of my knowledge.",1426611332

It&#x27;s fine if all you want to do is get to the center of the city, but to actually travel around the city it sucks.<p>And parts of Philadelphia have a severe parking problem.

Sure, I wish iOS could have implemented features that align with Android and vice versa. But IMO the problem here actually comes from how the &quot;web of apps&quot; evolved separately from the WWW.<p>On a more concrete note, there are scenarios where neither DNS nor special HTML metadata work. A great example of this is Uber or Lyft. Both of these apps support mobile deeplinking, however there is no real concept of a &quot;page&quot; in these apps. These kinds of apps are more like utilities or services (ride sharing, making phone calls, starting a run, etc), rather than content to consume (reading the news, playing music, watching a video, etc).",1426611255

Many women in the tech industry are concerned that Pao’s case is weak and that her accusations might exacerbate bias in the workplace. &quot;I worry that it will make a lot more men feel that—being nice to and mentoring and trying to be a good person toward women colleagues—they, too, will be hauled before a jury,&quot; says Melinda Riechert, managing partner in the Silicon Valley office of law firm Morgan Lewis. For example, a key allegation in the case is that a Kleiner partner, Randy Komisar, behaved inappropriately when he gave Pao a volume of Leonard Cohen’s poems and drawings (entitled Book of Longing) on Valentine’s Day and asked her out to dinner on a night when his wife was out of town. Komisar says it was completely friendly and that his wife bought the book for Pao. Will men now retreat from cordial gestures toward female colleagues?<p>Does anyone else not see the immediate disconnect here?<p>I agree that Pao&#x27;s case is weak but:<p>It juxtaposes that with a woman saying something about &quot;being nice and mentoring&quot; while pointing out at the same time a married man is handing out gifts on Valentine&#x27;s Day.<p>I mean, come on. Does anyone seriously think that was anything other than hitting on Pao?<p>Any other day of the year it would have been fine.

We are more likely to report being stalked and harassed on the Internet—of the 3,787 people who reported harassing incidents from 2000 to 2012 to the volunteer organization Working to Halt Online Abuse, 72.5 percent were female. Sometimes, the abuse can get physical: A Pew survey reported that five percent of women who used the Internet said “something happened online” that led them into “physical danger.” And it starts young: Teenage girls are significantly more likely to be cyberbullied than boys. Just appearing as a woman online, it seems, can be enough to inspire abuse.

9219086,comment,9216238,9216238,0,0,balabaster,,,"I never attended MIT, nor any big name college, but I have first hand experience struggling with impostor syndrome that I had since leaving high school and never having failed at anything I set my mind to. It was immediately noticeable from the first university math lecture where I was amongst an entire class of people who grasped concepts I had never even come across at high school and struggled to understand - even though I had never struggled at anything before in my life. I&#x27;d coasted through high school and nery once had to apply myself at anything - except Phys Ed. which was more a toil of will power than enjoyment. The feeling lasted until probably 5 or so years ago (my early 30s) - in fact, it had been such a prominent part of my psyche during that part of my life that it hadn&#x27;t crossed my mind that I&#x27;d moved on until just as I was reading this article.<p>Upon reflection, I think most of the feeling stemmed from my perception of how other people were handling themselves in a world I personally felt I was floundering in. They appeared to take everything in their stride, understanding everything while I understood nothing and spent many thousands of hours attempting to understand just to keep from failing academic life - forget trying to be top of my class as I was used to. Then I became a programmer, thinking that once I left university, I would be okay; at that point, I would have made it. But the feeling never went away as I continued to feel like I was floundering, while my peers appeared to breeze through concepts I had to work bloody hard to grasp. It took many years for it to dawn on me that I spent far too long looking at how other people <i>looked like</i> they were handling it and comparing it to the actual struggles I was having.  This has been dubbed the Facebook effect, where everyone else appears to have such a great life because that&#x27;s what they show the world and you compare that to the struggles you have just to find time to shower, forget looking perfect.<p>I have come to believe that impostor syndrome is a symptom of the lack of authenticity in society. Nobody is real with each other and that largely is the cause of our inability to gauge how deserving we are of the positions we hold. Behind closed doors, everyone is floundering in different aspects of their lives. Some areas of life come easily to some, while others remain a constant struggle their entire lives - but what they show you is a tiny snippet - the snippet they <i>want</i> to show you. As Baz Lurhman said in Sunscreen, &quot;Sometimes you&#x27;re ahead, sometimes you&#x27;re behind, the race is long, and in the end it&#x27;s only with yourself.&quot; It has only really been as I have come to see and understand this pervasive lack of authenticity in society that the impostor syndrome has gone away. I believe that eventually all people get there, they say that 40 is the age that you stop caring what other people think and start living for yourself. I think it goes deeper than this and isn&#x27;t tied to an age. I think as soon as you hit the dawning realization that everything you see around you is no more than what those around you want to show you and that it&#x27;s all a carefully sculpted illusion to make you believe what they want you to believe about them, their lives, their businesses etc. you will realize...<p>You are not an impostor. You are in the position you are in because someone sees or saw something in you that you haven&#x27;t yet begun to see, understand or accept in yourself. They gave you the chance you asked for because they believed in you - even when you may not have believed in yourself. The impostor syndrome you are experiencing is an illusion. You may not understand that yet, you may not accept that yet, but trust me, as someone who spent a larger portion of my life battling it than not battling it, you will make it, you did deserve the chance you were given, you do deserve to be doing what you are doing. You <i>are already</i> what you are struggling to realize and you don&#x27;t need to fake it until you make it. Have heart, everyone has struggles, everyone has failures, everyone has successes. Don&#x27;t give in to your insecurities, they are the beliefs instilled in you by <i>society&#x27;s failure to you</i> - they are all so busy faking it until they make it that it&#x27;s leaving you comparing their fake with your reality.",1426609703

9219076,comment,9218691,9218691,0,0,dalke,,,"The first commercial app I wrote was in 1997/early 1998. Previous ones I wrote were all in-house CGI scripts. I learned perl in 1994 because of the CGI examples at NCSA, the one in perl was the most readable.<p>It was a turn-key bioinformatics app. The back-end would pull in the latest data sets from a few ftp servers, index the records for fast lookup, prepare indices for several specialized bioinformatics search methods (FASTA, BLAST, etc.), etc.<p>The front-end took user queries, did a search using the back-end command-line tools, and marked up the search results to include links to the actual records. Each record had links for further search. Users were used to the command-line output, so this UI was a refinement of what they expected rather than develop a new report interface.<p>It was all CGI driven behind NCSA httpd, using perl4 because that&#x27;s what would be on the likely user machines. (Eg, SGI IRIX shipped with perl4, and we had strong user feedback from another product that everyone was migrating to perl from awk, sed, etc.) This meant URLs like /program.cgi?db=xyz&id=123 instead of /db/xyz/123 because there was no routing other than the file system. During this time I tried learning Perl5, but couldn&#x27;t understand its object system.<p>This also means I used cgi-lib.pl and not the later CGI.pm. You can still see my name in the lib-cgi credits at <a href=""http://cgi-lib.berkeley.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cgi-lib.berkeley.edu/</a> .<p>There was no widely used templating language. Of course, it&#x27;s not hard to write one, which is what I did, but that&#x27;s extra maintenance and development overhead.<p>There was no database, because those were expensive, and hard to use. (Postgre95 was available, but I had tried to use it in &#x27;95 and ran into problems getting it to work; or perhaps into difficulties in understanding the concept.) In any case, Perl4 had only limited access to SQL. I think it required a special patched version of Perl, which influenced how Perl5 supports extensions. Plus, I don&#x27;t think it was until Greenspun&#x27;s &quot;Database Backed Web Sites: the thinking person&#x27;s guide to web publishing&quot; in 1997 that people in general started really looking into database-backed web sites. A year or two later was the big question of mSQL vs. MySQL. Nowadays a SQL database comes with Python.<p>This also meant no user accounts or configuration, which wasn&#x27;t a design requirement.<p>But it also meant I had to figure out a way to look up 100s of thousands of records. I eventually created an index file of alphabetically sorted identifiers with start/end positions, and wrote Perl code to do a binary search on the data.<p>I looked into dbm and variants, but they weren&#x27;t effective for what I wanted. Either the portability to different endian machines wasn&#x27;t there, or the performance wasn&#x27;t there. A couple of years later I would likely have used Sleepycat&#x27;s dbm for the task. Now I use sqlite.<p>It had one piece of JavaScript. The back-end had different CGI scripts for different tasks. The front-end had a pull-down menu to select the task. The JS changed the target URL, rather than having either a redirect CGI script or merging the back-ends to have a central call point.<p>My development environment then, as now, was an emacs variant, primarily on a unix desktop, with a Windows box for testing on IE. QA used IE, because automation tools were available to help build a test suite.<p>There may have been free form text search. I don&#x27;t fully recall now, but I have a memory of waiting for a license for a text engine from a university-based project (in Arizona?)",1426609660

However...<p>If you don&#x27;t need to work again { at this company, in your industry, in your city, at all }, you should feel free to say whatever you want.  That freedom takes years or decades of hard work to earn, and once earned should be used!  Just how willing you should be to burn bridges depends on your personal situation and the nature of your industry and profession; if these are not people you would ever work with or for again anyway, and you wouldn&#x27;t want a job with someone else in the same city or industry who respects their opinion, then the advice to say nothing for your own sake does not apply.<p>All that said, what are you trying to accomplish?  If you&#x27;ve decided to resign and that decision is final, you&#x27;re not going to accrue any benefit yourself.  If you&#x27;re looking for a counteroffer, forget it; you likely won&#x27;t get one, and you&#x27;ll be a marked man if you do.  If your motives are altruistic (either for the benefit of the shareholders or your peers), then you must be hopelessly naive.  These people are corporate managers, and so are their superiors; they&#x27;ve been carefully selected for sociopathy, greed, and incompetence by a mature and very stable set of processes.  They know morale is in the tank and they don&#x27;t care.  The company is probably in trouble owing to mismanagement and they&#x27;re probably hoping a few people will leave on their own so they can save themselves not only the cost of pay rises but also of severance.  Telling them what they already know will, at best, give them fodder for the jokes they&#x27;ll tell at your expense in the executive washroom.  If your goal is simply to go out in style, don&#x27;t bother with the letter; no one will read it anyway.  Instead, write a public article (carefully avoiding the use of confidential information!) or invite all your peers out to a giant party at which you roast management ruthlessly.  The leadership principle is to criticize in private and praise in public, but the opposite applies when dealing with corporate management: anything negative you want to say has to be said in public.  Private criticism of corporate managers only gives them an opportunity to get ahead of you, whether by having Security remove you from the premises immediately, by slandering you among your peers, or by suing you.  Why?  Because when you tell them something you&#x27;re not telling everyone, you give them information, and they will always use that information to their advantage and your injury.  Unfortunately, if you have something negative to say about your employer, the only effective place to do so is in the press.<p>So while I disagree that one should never provide one&#x27;s reasons out of self-preservation, I also don&#x27;t see much point in using the letter of resignation as the means of doing so.

In essence he&#x27;s comparing a trendline to a single outlier, and using that to come to an invalid conclusion.<p>Using that sort of reasoning, it&#x27;s pretty trivial to show no &quot;warming&quot;.  But it&#x27;s nothing more than statistical trickery.  When you look at the overall trend, it&#x27;s pretty clear that global warming has continued apace, right in line with predictions made decades ago.  It&#x27;s actually pretty impressive how closely reality has hewed to those predictions:<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/27/climate-change-model-global-warming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/27/climate-c...</a>",1426609017

Because of false loyalty and a nurtured  feeling of guilt, I waited too long and only resigned when it had already begun affecting my health (physically and mentally).<p>I made the mistake of trying to be honest. I explained why I felt that the work environment needed to be improved. I tried not to come across as accusatory and didn&#x27;t blame anyone, just stating that the environment negatively affected my health and that it was likely the reason for other systemic problems (e.g. the high turnover) the company was facing and should be addressed.<p>Big mistake.<p>To keep a long story short, I ended up suing the company because they withheld payments arguing I owed them work (and in fact threatened to sue me over that). I would have likely won, but agreed to a settlement (that mostly consisted of them giving me money and me signing a statement that I had already turned in all property of theirs before quitting -- which wasn&#x27;t really contested to begin with).<p>All in all, it wasn&#x27;t worth it. I lost a budding friendship with a colleague who stayed with the company (and likely had to bear the fallout from my resignation) and the first couple of weeks after the resignation (before I decided to sue and was able to hand it all over to a lawyer) were a complete nightmare, even though I didn&#x27;t spend a single day of it at the company.<p>Now there is a company out there where employees think badly of me because they were either hired during the fallout or were told stories about it if they joined after the fact. There&#x27;s an employer who hates my guts and may have told others to avoid me. And there&#x27;s a company I&#x27;ll have to avoid working with (directly or not) in the future.<p>I&#x27;m sure there was no possibility of a &quot;good&quot; ending at the point I quit to begin with because my biggest mistake was holding out until I was too broken to leave gracefully. But I&#x27;m also pretty sure a simple &quot;I&#x27;m leaving for greener pastures&quot; type resignation could have at least avoided fuelling the fire.<p>Don&#x27;t ever go into the details about why you&#x27;re leaving. If anyone depends on you, make sure to find a graceful transition for them (if only by informing them well in advance), but don&#x27;t ever say anything that implies they should have done things differently.<p>Despite what people say, most of them don&#x27;t want your honest opinion. They just want to hear they&#x27;ve done nothing wrong. You&#x27;re already causing a disruption for them by leaving, don&#x27;t allow them to spin it into an attack. You&#x27;re far more likely to make them think if you <i>don&#x27;t</i> give them an opportunity to think of you as an aggressor (and if they will do so anyway, you have lost nothing).<p>On the flip side, the <i>right</i> time to bring up problems is while you are still intent on working there. If delivering outstanding work is not acknowledged, address it <i>before</i> you have decided to leave. As an employee, your opinion holds weight (because ignoring it may result in your resignation). If you&#x27;ve already resigned, you&#x27;ve already played your hand.<p>(If you do, however, maintain a friendship with your former employer, you may be able to talk to him about the reasons why you left, but not as an ex-employee at work, but as a friend -- preferably in a different environment altogether.)",1426608663

(See also Ruby-style DSLs that somehow encourage you to forget you&#x27;re actually still in Ruby, for instance.)<p>Anyhow, the solution to &quot;repetitive HTML&quot; is the <i>exact same</i> as the solution to &quot;repetitive code&quot;, because it <i>is</i> repetitive code: Factor it.<p>Get used to this approach and honestly, the only thing that a conventional template is better at is large blocks of static HTML tags; otherwise, a &quot;powerful, rich, awesome, wonderful&quot; template language that everyone goes gaga over is just an inner-platform effect problem mistaken for virtue.<p>I&#x27;m also generally underwhelmed by the &quot;&#x27;dumb&#x27; designer has to be able to edit it&quot;...

9218855,comment,9218213,9218752,0,0,tel,,,"Modules as Odersky refers to them here (modules &quot;in the sense of ML&quot;) do not exist in Erlang or Haskell at all. They are a unique typing discipline.<p>In MLs, in large part to ensure that HM-style type inference remains &quot;complete&quot;, the module type language is stratified from the value type language. This feels a bit repetitive, causes slow expansion of flexibility and power in the module language, and makes it difficult to refer to modules dynamically.<p>For some, these are all good things. In this point of view, modules are &quot;large&quot; in a way that makes them difficult to reason about and so the restrictive language they&#x27;re manipulated with is vital for making them reasonable.<p>For others, you might as well just unify the &quot;large&quot; module language and the &quot;small&quot; value language. If you do this carefully you might not even lose &quot;complete&quot; HM inference [0].<p>This is the path that Scala takes though it unabashedly tosses out HM inference for the a highly incomplete (e.g. &quot;local&quot;) subtype/supertype logic.<p>Now there&#x27;s a bit of an assertion that floats around that Scala&#x27;s objects are essentially equal in power to what ML&#x27;s modules would be if they were first class. I&#x27;m not sure if anyone could quite make this formal prior to the core calculus clean-up that is going through with dotty. Perhaps after that point the unique features of Scala will be emphasized... or we&#x27;ll truly determine that Scala is just a unique approach to ML modules which has a different type inference engine.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/1ml/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/1ml/</a>",1426608160

But it&#x27;s not in the investors&#x27; interest to publish their internal research on the error bars and it IS in the interest of the startup to publish as high a valuation as possible.

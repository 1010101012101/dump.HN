7921,comment,7867,7867,0,0,rfrey,,,"Nowhere did this article say that 50% of research papers were not ""factually accurate"".  It says faulty research methods mean 50% of conclusions are not true.<p>Which is itself a ridiculous thing for New Scientist to repeat.  The basis of the scientific method is that we don't ever try to prove things are true.  We just show that there's a good chance (1 in 20 is standard) that a model fits.  Statistical methods are used and statistics is another area that has no truck with ""truth"" -- it is the mathematics of making your way in a probabilistic universe. <p>Having papers come out with promising claims and having ""only"" 50% of them stand up to professional scrutiny is a wondrous miracle.  The entire scientific establishment is set up to disprove hypotheses as they emerge.  If half of them stand, the scientific establishment is not doing its job. <p>A sensationalist article that plays into the ""nobody really knows how things work, so I'll believe what I want"" meme.<p>",1175390451

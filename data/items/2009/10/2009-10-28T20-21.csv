The new release that we're working on is a combination of gut instincts and user feedback. Your users don't always know what's best, so you can't base new features or approaches on user feedback alone.<p>I think we'll get more heavily into some A/B testing, but really only on select pages. For example, I want to set up A/B testing for our new sign up page. Right now you can't upgrade immediately when first signing up. You instead need to sign up for a regular Meh account and then upgrade to Whoo! later. I want to test allowing people to upgrade immediately when they first sign up and see how that goes.",1256763593

I think measured IQ and family income would, together, be quite good predictors of SAT performance. But what leads me to believe that also leads me to believe that predictive strength would tail off as family income (or IQ) got extremely high. E.g., for very smart people, the SAT is probably not a challenge, so their score wouldn't benefit much from 10 more IQ points. Similarly, very rich people can't use their money to do much for their kids SAT score than those making $150k / year can.",1256763306

The argument they use is too slippery for me to grasp, but it basically sounds to me something like this:<p>Skeptics think that the laws of physics are sufficient to describe the universe. It suffices to show that magic is possible, and then skepticism is false. This is why opponents of skepticism do not have to point to actual cases of magic being performed; it is enough if such things are possible.<p>Second, along the lines of conceivable -> possible, here's an interesting thought experiment.<p>I can conceive of an immovable object. An object such that when it is inserted into our universe, it can never be moved with respect to some frame of reference. Such an object is much easier to conceive of than a zombie.<p>I can conceive of an irresistable object. This object is such that it moves with constant velocity relative to some frame of reference, and its velocity can never be changed.<p>I find it hard to accept that the possibility of such concepts can be used to show anything useful about the universe.<p>Further on, I found that the best counterexample included was that of Daniel Dennett, who compares the idea of consciousness against the idea of health - to quote the quotation:<p>Supposing that by an act of stipulative imagination you can remove consciousness while leaving all cognitive systems intact — a quite standard but entirely bogus feat of imagination — is like supposing that by an act of stipulative imagination, you can remove health while leaving all bodily functions and powers intact. … Health isn’t that sort of thing, and neither is consciousness (1995, 325).
<end quotation><p>Finally, it's nice that they went out and mentioned all the issues with semantics around the concepts of 'conceivable' and 'possible', because that was the part that feels like it wants to give me a migraine.<p>Last thought: 
One of the ideas was that whatever it is that distinguishes us from zombies does not exist in a physical sense. But we have devices that can read our thoughts - or at least show that our physical state is changing while we think.<p>My MRI shows brain activity, therefore I am.",1256761985

908645,story,,,9,1,4295,"Splitting from my business partner - my journey in self esteem",,"This is the story of my personal journey and my relationship with my business partner.  Our business is still alive and solvent, but I've moved on.  Even though I'll be throwing away 2 years worth of work, writing off a significant amount of cash, and having to start from scratch again I strongly believe I'll be better off starting again.<p>The business partnership started off great.  We tried a few ideas (all of which could have been grown into something good I believe), and then we settled on our first (and only) real moneymaker.<p>We were from different backgrounds – he had the gift of the gab, was an amazing salesman in some areas, had experience and boldness.  He was bankrupt, but that was no problem as I wasn't borrowing money off him (Warning sign?).  I was an intelligent but inexperienced techy, who needed a bit of a confidence boost.  The early days of the partnership worked out great as we complimented each others strengths and weaknesses really well.<p>We built this organically, never over-stretching ourselves.  I quit my day job, and my partner took the same wage as me.  He didn't quit his work as he had substantial financial commitments, but he could do his work outside of our business hours.  (Warning sign?)<p>The friction started as we became a little larger.  We were pulling in $10-15k a month, but all of it other than our ramen wage got spent.  Larger offices, unneeded staff, lots of advertising.  Basically the money all went into making us look good, and saving our time.  A lot of the costs could have been saved by being us founders being more hands-on, and I always wanted to cut costs, but let most of the spendings go ahead.<p>Our next project was to copy a franchise idea we'd seen that we could do at a fraction of the cost.  The only problem with this was that the franchise was a dud in the first place – it's so important to do your own research.  Once we'd pulled the plug on this (never an easy decision), we moved onto our next project.  More frivolous spending, and here's the painful bit.  We figured we needed investment and a larger space.  My business partner borrowed a large amount, and I personally guaranteed a property lease which was a similar commitment.<p>As you may have guessed, we then set about spending all this money with great haste, only slowing  down as we ran out of money.  As this was going on, I was building the new business almost single-handedly, working ever hour I could.  Eventually enough got to be enough.  I was putting my whole life into the business, I'd loaned it an additional money and forsaken wages so that I was in debt, and while I could see the way forwards my business partner was not bringing anything helpful to the table.  The last straw was money that had been promised as a loan to the business by my business partner went to pay for his personal spending.<p>It's now been 6 months since I quit.  The first month was spent working at a good speed, building a new business (that I ultimately never did much with).  The next 3 months were spent sat on my ass, and the last 2 months have been spent working for someone else.  If I were to go through another bad time like this again, I'd have bitten the bullet and taken a job much sooner, as I believe that it's this that really pulled me back onto my feet.  I'm now starting to get the fire back into my belly, and am ready to start my next adventure.<p>What I've learned from this is that I KNEW for a long time that the partnership wasn't right, and that the business wasn't going in the direction I wanted to take it.  I should never have let things slide and let my business partner take financial decisions I wasn't happy with.  The business would either have been much stronger, or we'd have split apart much earlier if I'd been stronger.  I should also have trusted in myself and my own ability much more, rather than deferring to my more experienced business partner or our advisers.  Never let anyone else make the big decisions for you.  Being an entrepreneur is about leading, about creating something new, and making something big.",1256760460

908640,comment,908513,908577,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Not to mention that the ability to raise additional money after YC would be significantly impeded by being cagey about the ideas behind the company. Almost every investor I've ever heard speak on the subject has said they simply do not sign NDAs. If someone expects YC to sign an NDA, they would likely expect every other potential investor to sign an NDA...and that's not going to happen.<p>I suspect that investors not being willing to sign NDAs is at least as much attributable to the fact that people who want random people to sign NDAs have too much confidence that their idea alone has value, and thus won't understand that execution is vital, and likely will not be willing to evolve their idea as the market demands.  Well, that, and ""idea"" people are just generally useless and annoying.  So, asking for an NDA is a sign that you're a useless non-starter who won't be able to build a company or compete in the market (because your idea has to be public before you can do anything with it; if you're concerned that your only advantage is secrecy, then it seems likely to me that failure is imminent).",1256760356

<a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/09/17/national-hockey-leagues-san-jose.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/09/17/national-...</a><p>Both teams played (or play) at the SAP Center (San Jose Arena).  Probably, the 747 tail advert was a deal-clincher, goodwill/promotion gesture or both.  It makes a lot of sense to drive/cross-promote advertising, sponsorships and other business into a common ecosystem.<p>As it happens, I used to hang out with the Sabercats and (now former) Saberkittens at (undisclosed) because of a Stanford hookup.  Since I don&#x27;t find drinking fun anymore, I&#x27;m old and boring now. :)",1439009990
10026386,comment,10024958,10026041,0,0,wpietri,,,"> The idea that service providers destroy data when a cap is reached is just plain weird.<p>This fellow is proposing an account that&#x27;s capped. In AWS-land with by-the-hour servers, that would presumably mean terminating running servers. Servers that have data in RAM. Servers with volatile local disks that get recycled as soon at they&#x27;re terminated. Maybe you have an idea of how to shut down all of Amazon&#x27;s 40-odd services with no risk of data loss, but I&#x27;m not seeing one.<p>If they&#x27;re not going terminate them, then either they&#x27;re going to keep charging or not. If they keep charging, then it seems like it&#x27;s more a billing alert plus a service interruption. If they don&#x27;t charge, then it&#x27;s more like what they do now, which is waive charges for mistakes, except with a service interruption.<p>> Similarly, it&#x27;s also weird that people think Amazon doesn&#x27;t care about 4- and 5-figure accounts.<p>I think they do care about them. I&#x27;m just saying they won&#x27;t go out of their way for the $50/month accounts if it means putting serious customers at risk.",1439009867

They prefer high margin items like laptops or washer/dryer combinations. This is quite a bit lower than when parts distributors Wyle and Arrow were complaining that Fry&#x27;s was selling individual parts at the 1K quantity price and cutting off their margins.<p>They also managed to kill off the electronics stores in the Bay area, Sunnyvale Electronics, Jade Systems, JDR Microdevices, Quement, Quest, Etc. JameCo has survived but in part because they have a decent mail order business and hold the line on their prices. I wrote a letter to Bill Fry complaining because after they killed off those businesses their component supply dropped off dramatically leaving folks in Silicon Valley ordering from a company in Minnesota to get parts they use to source locally.<p>That said, I find it hilarious when they have in their display case test equipment offered for sale from companies that are no longer in business.<p>[1] Of course Radio Shack probably cited <i>everything</i> at one time or another as to why they were going out of business.",1439008978

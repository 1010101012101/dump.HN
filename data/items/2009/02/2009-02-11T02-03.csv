Not to say the latter can't be done in Rails, though. But the original focus of the framework seems clear.",1234317967

I didn't do any serious programming until my intro to programming course my first semester. I did some programming in a high school course, but really, my start as a programmer coincided with the start of my formal education.<p>But during my education, I was exposed to things I doubt I would have encountered on my own. In particular, what I learned from my programming languages, compilers and operating systems courses. In fact, if it had not been for my programming language course, I don't know if I would have realized how much I like thinking about how to express concepts in code. If it wasn't for my graduate studies, I doubt I would have become so comfortable with systems programming and performance in general.<p>I'm also a biases person to ask because I'm close to getting my Ph.D. I have a Bachelor's and a Master's. So I've done a decent amount of schoolin'.<p>The problem with being self-taught is sometimes you just don't know what you don't know. I know it sounds boring, predictable and constraining to learn a menu of concepts. But the benefit is that lots of people who came before you decided ""these things are important to know to be in our field.""<p>(Hope you see this reply, I didn't realize you replied until just now.)",1234317695

With Django, you choose your own Javascript framework and do it yourself.  Which isn't a bad thing at all, I actually prefer Django's way.<p>With Django, it's easier making web sites because of the built in automatic admin interface.  It's production ready.  With Rails, you have a lot of plugins/generators to choose from which does the same thing though (which again, isn't a bad thing at all).<p>Honestly though, Rails/Django users have created plugins/apps to extend their favorite framework, so it's really easy to make websites AND web apps with both now.",1234317694

It&#x27;s impossible to use that mixture for weapons, and it&#x27;s much harder to isolate the Pu239 than it is to enrich natural uranium.<p>In some thorium designs, the fissionable U233 (bred from thorium) is mixed with U232, which is also very hard to separate and makes the material unworkable for weapons. (However, this is not true of all thorium designs. Chemically separate the protactinium and it will decay to pure U233.)<p>If you had one of the nonproliferating designs and were silly enough to attempt using it for weapons production, you would need much larger and more sophisticated enrichment facilities than if you just enriched natural uranium.

So you need to understand the needs of all the stakeholders outside the dev team. (At least the basics; functional details deserve an expert of their own.)",1433331922

The majority of the cost lies in the clinical trials process. That is where a potential drug can fail and take everything down the drain. That is why the &quot;fail-early, fail-fast&quot; mantra has been ingrained into big pharmacy like gospel truth. However, there is no reliable predictor of &quot;late stage&quot; clinical trial failures for a candidate drug molecule. And trials can fail from a drug having statistically insignificant improvements in a group of target patients, all the way to, having a high (how high?) propensity for adverse effects in the patient group.<p>So, the solution? More fundamental research to explore indicators of late stage failure, coupled with &quot;cheaper&quot; clinical trials to justify a lower development cost that is enforced by legislation to bypass greedy execs/shareholders.

A three-year span where you gain a large percentage, offset by a large drop (which is possible if investing -- aka 2000-era tech bubble crash), results in you having significantly less money than a more subtle, even, diversified rate.

9651770,comment,9650289,9651001,0,0,cromwellian,,,"I&#x27;m not a lawyer, and this is strictly my own guessing, but I think often times these privacy policies exist to prevent being sued for regular app behavior. For example, ability to create derivative works, publish, or distribute content could cover things like transcoding, proxying, caching, and redisplay.<p>So for example, if you don&#x27;t claim the right to create derivative works, then transcoding an image, sending it from a different CDN domain, etc could get you in trouble.<p>Trying to read worst case scenarios by reading between the lines I think amounts to FUD because the policies are authored for the judicial system, not the consumers. Lawyers try to stake out as much leeway as they can. These companies will be judged on what they say they will and will not do and that doesn&#x27;t just mean the legalese.<p>For example, if Google Photos says they will not do X or Y with your photos, they will be judged on whether or not they ever do that, whether or not that particular restriction is part of the general blanket policy for all services.<p>My general opinion is to attack people for actually what they do, not what they could theoretically do. Really, do you think Google Photos is going to people&#x27;s private photos and use them without permission in promotional materials without permission? You&#x27;ve taken a particular example (a public business listing) and applied it to a case like Photos.<p>If you link here: <a href=""http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a><p>You find this:<p>&quot;Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.&quot;<p>Which seems to suggest that if you delete data, it will eventually be removed, but might linger on in old backup tapes. Now imagine you don&#x27;t carve out such leeway, and nuisance lawsuits are brought against you because say, you only destroy your oldest backups every N months for practical reasons. Or perhaps an HTTP caching proxy ends up with a non-accessible copy lingering on its disk.<p>There&#x27;s two ways you can think about such policies, cynicism or optimism. The cynic can assume the worst, and they want to keep your photos even after you leave, because machine learning algorithms predicted you&#x27;d be the best model for a new TV commercial campaign. The optimist will see it as part of providing a reliable, fault tolerant, cloud service, and that the data is actually used for what they say it is: to improve services.<p>If you want to be cynical and paranoid, at least be consistent. Run your own Cloud servers, don&#x27;t upload unencrypted data to other people&#x27;s cloud, that includes Apple, don&#x27;t trust anyone, because they can always change their mind, management, policies, later.<p>But if you are willing to trust, then stake your trust on what ills have actually been done or not done. A lot of claims are continually put forward about harm, but IMHO, the only one that really hold any water are the ones that involve the government getting access to your cloud data, and that&#x27;ll apply equally to all vendors in the jurisdiction, which goes back to the former point about cynicism and paranoia. If you&#x27;re paranoid enough, you should avoid cloud services altogether.<p>BTW, Google is blocked in China, Apple isn&#x27;t. What do you think Apple is doing differently in China that allows their services not to get blocked by the government?",1433330167

I would guess they&#x27;ll collect your data and call it privacy because they protect it against third parties, but they themselves wouldn&#x27;t protect your data from Apple.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t make much sense to really protect data. The supermarket in front of my office sells so called &quot;Extra Cards&quot; which advertise to not care about your data because you don&#x27;t have to enter your name or something. That they still collect what you buy, when you buy, and where you buy they simply don&#x27;t say and many people are fine with that. Even software developers have this card because they think their data is safe.<p>It&#x27;s hip to sell privacy, it&#x27;s not hip to really offer privacy.",1433329526

Since its founding there have been a <i>hell</i> of a lot of small projects hosted there whose sites have gone down since.  430,000 projects have been hosted on SourceForge at some point.  At least a few tens of thousands of them represent the only remaining copy of a program needed to read a certain sort of data.  Maintaining that capability in the face of a company circling the drain represents an <i>extreme</i> historical utility.<p>Even if you now need a VM to handle the crapware, that&#x27;s better than losing the apps entirely.  If somebody maintained a time-diffed mirror of SourceForge, they could pinpoint the last version before the bundling event occurred in an automated fashion, as well.<p>EDIT: It seems there&#x27;s a project to begin this - <a href=""http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=SourceForge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=SourceForge</a> and an IRC channel, EFNet #coldstorage",1433329497

In the end, if they release a product you don&#x27;t like you have to like it or lump it. The same goes with their software.<p>There was a significant backlash from when they changed the style in iOS7. They didn&#x27;t ask you what you wanted.\nThere was also a backlash when they introduced Lion and got rid of &quot;Save As&quot; or got rid of the maximise-equivalent in Yosemite (you have to hold down Alt now, how irritating), or when they removed the Web Sharing option in System Preferences and you have to manually restart Apache etc. etc. etc.<p>They also removed DVD drives on laptops, never gave us a Bluray drive, stopped us being able to upgrade RAM in laptops and Mac Minis, ditched accelerated graphics for the Mac Mini etc. etc. etc.<p>The list is quite long of the things that they have changed or removed that you can&#x27;t do anything about (and it is frequently irritating). As you decide to buy them and are happy with them, you may rationalise this as them making products that cater to you, but in truth they do not.<p>I say this as a developer who writes software for OSX as my day job btw.

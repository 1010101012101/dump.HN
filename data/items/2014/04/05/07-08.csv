7536326,comment,7536173,7536284,18,0,lordgilman,,,"The kernel has a debug option that can be specified at boot time to increase its logging verbosity.  systemd looks at the kernel command line to do the same and starts writing its own verbose logging out to the kernel&#x27;s message buffer.  Writing out to the kernel message buffer is done for pragmatic reasons: generally if you&#x27;re debugging init problems they&#x27;re happening when the machine is first starting so you would like to see the error messages on the serial console/virtual console.<p>The bug that started this all came up when someone had a broken system that was causing systemd to spew out tons of log messages.  This was overwhelming the kernel message system and causing things to time out/etc and resulted in an unbootable system.  When this problem got opened upstream, the systemd maintainer said &quot;not my problem.&quot;<p>There are a couple of ways forward here: systemd can limit its own output and say &quot;my bad&quot;[1], systemd can begin looking for its own debug flag in the kernel command line instead of using the kernel&#x27;s own debug flag or the kernel can implement rate limiting on the message system[2] to keep userspace from shooting itself in the foot.<p>Torvalds really doesn&#x27;t like the systemd maintainer&#x27;s &quot;not my problem&quot; attitude so he&#x27;s threatened to no longer accept pull requests from him for any code he writes.  Torvalds wrote a really good post in the linked Google+ comments that describes his feelings on the whole thing:<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t mind people piggy-backing on some fairly obvious generic term like &quot;debug&quot; per se. I don&#x27;t know if the old init scripts did that, but I do know they did it for &quot;quiet&quot;, which is basically the reverse of &quot;debug&quot;.<p>What I mind is people closing bugs and not admitting mistakes. If Kay had even said &quot;sorry, the excessive output was a bug in systemd, it&#x27;s already fixed in current -git&quot;, that would have been a valid reason to close the bug.<p>And for the people thinking this is a storm in a teacup: this is not the first time Kay has done this, which is why I personally get so frustrated.<p>Kay has done the exact same thing with major bugs that were not fixed anywhere else, and that caused machines to fail at boot time, and Kay happily pointed the finger elsewhere for months at a time and closed bugzilla entries. \uFEFF<p>Side explanatory note: and it&#x27;s because of that known history of abusive behavior that I would prefer systemd now use &quot;systemd.debug&quot;.<p>The old init scripts may or may not have parsed &quot;debug&quot;, but we never had any reason to care. Now we do, and people are (I think) understandably upset that systemd not only screwed up, but then the people involved weren&#x27;t even willing to say &quot;sorry&quot; about it but instead go &quot;uh, it wasn&#x27;t our bug, deal with it&quot;.\uFEFF&quot;<p>----<p>[1] This happened<p>[2] This will likely happen",1396684738

Uninstall the games, delete your accounts. If you think you have a serious problem with playing video games, then you are unlikely to be able to maintain your play in moderation.<p>- Try setting up multiple environments (dual boot, or 2 physical environments). One for work, one for play. That way you it is harder to get distracted by the games and there is a larger mental distinction between play time and work time.<p>- You are not alone!

When framing the question in terms of &quot;marrying opposite sex&quot;, it cannot be concluded that this rule violate equal protection (men and women are equally allowed to marry the opposite sex). When framing the question in terms of what an individual can do (Jane cannot marry Susan whereas John can), then it appears you violate equal protection. This scenario tells me one thing: that this reading of the issue is missing critical nuance.<p>Whenever a rephrasing of an issue can lead to the opposite conclusion, its clear that critical nuance is being stripped away. The fact is a marriage is a coupling of (at least) two people; one cannot meaningfully speak of an action of marriage of a single person. So framing the question in terms of what an individual can/can&#x27;t do seems to be the error. Restrictions on marriage can only be meaningfully applied to the set of all individuals involved; and there is no way to phrase it in this way that leads to an equal protection violation.",1396682744

Not to sensationalize, this happens in roughly 30% of sales, (usually by the sales person without actually thinking about it)... \n1. A person has seen a car online that they want. They may do the legwork and research the car. \n2. The walk into the dealership looking to buy the car. The 1 thing people don&#x27;t think about (generally) is the financing.\n3. They  find out that they don&#x27;t have the credit, income, etc... to actually finance that car. \n4.

It&#x27;s yet another layer on the server, it doesn&#x27;t solve caching issues, and it will certainly not make your average app faster, especially when http2 support is here.<p>GraphQL is an ORM for rest apis. I thought rest apis were supposed to be universal, why need another layer on top of it? How many ORMs do developers need ? how much more complex does it have to get? The goal of REST is first and foremost readability and simplicity. The purpose of fat clients are to push complexity on the client. With graphQL simplicity is gone since everything is POST thus no http caching, and the server now gets another layer of complexity instead of being client agnostic.<p>Again, it might make sense at Facebook scale, but many articles promoting GraphQL are not talking about the fact that, it might not make sense for the majority of applications out there, even worse, it actually might make apps slower because of that extra layer.",1444309162

So you can still pay, but the transactions will first be synchronized when the line is back up. So until that, they&#x27;re stored on the CC terminal itself.<p>HOWEVER when running in offline mode, the shops will pay a larger transaction fee. Also there are some risks, e.g. the transactions are lost if something happens to the CC terminal, and furthermore, the shop cannot verify the card (which is automatically done when it&#x27;s online).<p>So unfortunately, many shops don&#x27;t want to enable it..<p>However, the problem relies in Nets itself.

10352408,comment,10351830,10352103,0,0,vidarh,,,"> If you have a central place to plan the economy to distribute via need, that place is going to be heavily concentrated in power.<p>And this is why there is a left/right split within socialism, where the left wing - anarchists, libertarian socialists, left communists/libertarian communists, and a wide range of people using similar terms - argue for decentralisation and voluntary association as essential to safeguard the success of a socialist revolution.<p>You will also find that a portion of these ideologies argue for market mechanisms to various extents. There is <i>nothing</i> inherent in socialism that demands central planning. In fact, in most left socialist ideologies there would be no central organ with the power to impose central planning.<p>Even right wing socialists like the Bolsheviks were ambivalent about centralised planning to begin with, and initially did so out of pressing needs: They imposed strict planning initially <i>during the civil war</i> because a lot of people - the vast majority of who had either voted for other socialist parties (SR and the Mensheviks both did vastly better with the peasants than the Bolsheviks did) or the bourgeois parties in the 1917 elections - didn&#x27;t exactly go out of their way to help provide resources to the Bolshevik government. But as soon as the threat of the civil war was over, Lenin introduced &quot;New Economic Policy&quot; that liberalised the economy substantially, undid a lot of the centralisation and allowed for a limited market economy. Lenin indicated he believed NEP, or variations, would need to be in place for decades. It was Stalin that led the extreme centralization under the Bolsheviks, after Lenins death.<p>But in any case: In the case of the Bolsheviks, the abusive concentration of power started with their coup d&#x27;etat against the democratically elected socialist government after the Bolshevik losts the preliminary elections in 1917, not with their subsequent changes to the economic system; by then it was far too late.<p>> You can have evil people as heads of organisations but their power tends to be limited.<p>And this was a central aspect of the left/libertarian socialist/communist/anarchist groups criticism against groups like the Bolsheviks and theories like Lenins &quot;democratic centralism&quot; and idea of a &quot;vanguard&quot;. It&#x27;s a debate that raged already from the 1850&#x27;s, and continued as the Bolsheviks and their associates started murdering left communists together with everyone else opposing them.",1444309016

Lotus did a combination of these two fatal mistakes, they had a small team of 7 or so guys write the first version in 8086/8 assembly language, and I&#x27;m not sure exactly what happened to that team, but their EMS memory (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_memory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_memory</a>) mid-life kicker was unauthorized work done by a couple of guys who had left the company by the time Lotus used it in desperation because their complete rewrite of the code in C was failing so badly.<p>For that matter, their first Macintosh program, Jazz (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Jazz"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Jazz</a>) was fatally flawed in development.  They again wrote it in assembly &quot;for efficiency&quot;, but without close communications between team members.  Instead, every N days each would bring a floppy disk with their updated code and a merge would be done.  This resulted in a <i>lot</i> of duplication of functionality and a bloated binary (hitting the platform where it was at its worst); which among other things resulted in user frustration at having to swap floppy disks all the time as the Wikipedia article mentions.<p>Apple is a partial counterexample: Jobs rode a small team hard in creating the first rather limited assembly OS, software wise they largely wandered around in the wilderness and failed the complete rewrite (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copland_(operating_system)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copland_(operating_system)</a>), then solved their problem by buying NeXT (and, oh, started bringing Jobs back into the fold, one of the very few non-programmers who can manage them), and doing a wholesale replacement with NeXTSTEP.<p><i>Not that MS does not do terrible things as a business.

Microsoft&#x27;s terrible things included screwing pretty much <i>everybody</i> who did business with them at the peer level, &quot;<i>You made a mistake, you trusted us,&quot; said 3Com founder Bob Metcalfe, quoting an unnamed Microsoft executive.</i>&quot; (<a href=""http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2002/pulpit_20020620_000736.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2002/pulpit_20020620_0007...</a>).  You do enough of this and you run out of healthy companies willing to do business with you, and life becomes prohibitively expensive.  Which phone carrier is willing to partner with Microsoft after e.g. the Microsoft Kin: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Kin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Kin</a> and I&#x27;m sure other stunts?<p>I can&#x27;t think of another company at this level like this.  Apple and Oracle, like Microsoft companies built on the vision of a single man, share some characteristics, but Apple hasn&#x27;t screwed over <i>every</i> supplier, and works well enough with phone carriers.

Mostly because this is the government&#x27;s chance to make up for their colossal fuck up over Aaron Swartz. And because incarcerating Keys has so little value; he seems to have learned his lesson and in the time since his indictment has continued to do good journalism work, even landing new jobs.<p>But if you believe the government&#x27;s narrative isn&#x27;t totally hocus pocus, that the IRC logs truly depict what they seem to, that Keys maintained the identity of &quot;AESCracked&quot; throughout the period of his alleged hacking...then to portray his actions as just helping to change a story&#x27;s headline for the lulz is plain dishonest.<p>Read the search warrant yourself [1], starting with page 39.<p>He not only gives his credentials over; in the conversation, he talks about creating new accounts for hackers to use (yes, apparently an average web producer -- even after being fired -- has superuser privileges on the Tribune CMS). He then walks the other IRC users through how to navigate the CMS. He doesn&#x27;t <i>just</i> encourage them to &quot;go fuck some shit up!&quot; on the LA Times, he then proceeds to enumerate every news site owned by Tribune, with particular instruction on which places should be hit for being &quot;tribune&#x27;s bread and butter assets&quot;.<p>What really irks me is that hackers, page 47, then talk about rooting the Tribune server to gain access to to emails and everything else. And &quot;AESCracked&quot; is just sitting there, goading them along, giving them more information completely unprompted. It&#x27;s hard for me to believe that any reporter who knows what &quot;root access&quot; means can say with a straight face that Keys is only guilty of a prank, that the possibility of an entire news organization&#x27;s data -- including every reporter&#x27;s email -- being captured and dumped like HBGary or Ashley Madison or Sony, is just no big deal.<p>So why didn&#x27;t that happen? Who knows -- but the fact that a company who granted superuser access to all web producers to their non-https publicly-exposed CMS, and had no process for revoking credentials, and did nothing even after noticing said superuser account was creating new unauthorized accounts -- managed to <i>not</i> get rooted after said credentials were given over is a bonafide Christmas miracle. One of the other IRC users (sharpie) decided on his/her own to fuck around with the LA Times in a way that was immediately obvious to the Tribune sysops, who then removed user privileges.<p>Giving out superuser credentials to a hacker&#x27;s group causes $0 worth of damage. Creating new user accounts (including another super user account) causes $0 of damage. Giving out every URL to the different CMSes, including the user manual about how to navigate their interfaces causes $0 of damage. Sure, it adds up to less than $5,000 of damage if you believe bits are just nothing but electronic blips. But let&#x27;s not be dishonest and say that this was just a good ol&#x27; fun prank like the time when Woz programmed the campus computer system to bulk print &quot;FUCK NIXON&quot; [2]<p>But yeah, the truth is that no real damage was caused despite the potential -- the $900K+ of damages cited was the money spent by Tribune to overhaul their system, including making CMS login URLs https. And hopefully, a better access-control system...and frankly, I&#x27;m OK with that kind of technicality allowing Keys to just get probation. Worser criminals have gotten acquitted for lesser reasons. But I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s right to gloss over his crime. IMO, what he did was not just less admirable than what Snowden and Aaron Swartz did, but more sociopathic than what weev was imprisoned for. According to the IRC transcript, Keys had no problem abetting a chatroom full of hackers with completely fucking his colleagues -- and any and all confidential sources for any ongoing journalism investigations.<p>On a lighter note, page 46 of the search warrant is fun reading and I think sheds light on why the Tribune company didn&#x27;t get completely owned. The hackers invite Keys to paste all the user credentials to their private hackerpad, and after doing so, Keys asks, &quot;what&#x27;s the govt passwords for? what lulz will be unleashed soon? or is that for me to not know? :p&quot;...the responses in the IRC from the hackers after they realize what they&#x27;ve just let slip to a total stranger are just pure comedy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.laweekly.com/news/matthew-keys-helped-anonymous-hack-los-angeles-times-website-feds-allege-4175127"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.laweekly.com/news/matthew-keys-helped-anonymous-h...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=Yd2Hm8BlzZUC&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162&dq=wozniak+fuck+nixon&source=bl&ots=KZdktxAOzS&sig=n5dM8cTZTNo9v_OM3Kg4XbIpXd4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMIlPPp8e6yyAIVkS2ICh3riARC#v=onepage&q=wozniak%20fuck%20nixon&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=Yd2Hm8BlzZUC&pg=PA162&lpg=...</a>",1444307806

The term libertarianism originates with the French anarcho-communist  Joseph Déjacques back in the 19th century, and was championed by groups like the Socialist League in the UK (which was supported by Friedrich Engels and Eleanor Marx amongst others).<p>Modern-day right-wing libertarianism is the new kid on the block.<p>Basically in the late 1800&#x27;s the main split between anarchists and communists in the First International was not predominantly their end goal.<p>E.g. consider the famous concept of the &quot;whithering away of the state&quot; (coined by Friedrich Engels, but Engels attributed the idea to Marx): that given that according to Marxism the state is predominantly a tool of class rule, and that communism by their definition is the stage of society where there no longer are any classes, the state will cease to have a political purpose and will &quot;whither away&quot;. So anarchists and communists agreed the state was a tool of oppression and that this oppression must be removed, and that the state will eventually disappear.<p>The split was over methods. How to get there. The anarchists generally favoured a quicker, more immediate, dismantling of the state (whether by taking control and orderly dismantling it, or by rising up and destroying it), while communists generally favoured an intermediate transitional stage. In Marxism the intermediate stage is socialism: A phase where the proletariat is meant to take control of the state (hence the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; in contrast with Marx description of capitalist democracies as the &quot;dictatorship of the bourgeoisie&quot;), and for the first time wield it as a weapon of the majority against the minority, and use it to remove the class differences. So communists traditionally saw the state as a tool for the working class.<p>Eventually this lead to the split of the First International, where Marx came out victorious, and most of the anarchists left when Bakunin was thrown out. Not long after, new libertarian socialist/communist tendencies started &quot;filling the gap&quot; in the International left by the anarchists.<p>The extent of support for a strong state varied greatly amongst people who called themselves communists, leading to screeds like Lenins &quot;Left Communism: An Infantile Disorder&quot;, which targeted exactly libertarian Communists which opposed his ideas of a vanguard.",1444306693

A buyer and seller cooperate to make an exchange.<p>Coase&#x27;s question was: why don&#x27;t we see the free market structure that linear algebra predicts? Why do firms exist?<p>His answer was fairly insightful. Markets impose search and transaction costs. To buy something from a market, you must search it for a seller and come to terms.<p>Inside a firm, that search cost may well be zero. Need HR services? Call HR. No need to look for a provider, negotiate a contract and so on. Need IT? Ring the support department. No need to weigh the virtues of IBM vs HP vs the corner store.<p>But sometimes it&#x27;s the other way around. Need pens? In some companies the process is so onerous that you&#x27;ll just go to the local store and buy your own.<p>That boundary moves around (consider the impact of IT, for example), but it&#x27;s always there.

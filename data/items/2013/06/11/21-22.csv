5864978,comment,5864213,5864213,6,0,skore,,,"In a conversation with another developer, we debated a development that could be &quot;a project&quot; of some form. We disagreed on one thing, though: My conclusion was &quot;might be interesting, but I&#x27;m not sure if this would be useful to others&quot; while the other concluded &quot;this is pointless, would be a waste of time to even start&quot;.<p>This post rang very true in that light. It&#x27;s all very nice to only do deeply logical and important things, but it drains the brain dry because you arrive in a headspace where you are incapable of surprising yourself. Sure, you make a lot of progress - but only on existing, known problems. Those solutions you build are often useless once you get a new set of problems or the entire domain shifts and your very concept of what a problem is, in itself, is shaken. And, of course, sometimes you need to develop solutions to problems that aren&#x27;t even seen as problems in the first place.<p>Usually, I do my best work whenever I act on a hunch, compelled by curiosity.<p>Screw all the tricks about how to get yourself &quot;into the flow&quot; and the whining about productivity. If you need motivation, do something that is interesting. Usually, it&#x27;s so incredibly compelling that your brain doesn&#x27;t even work in the &quot;motivated vs. not motivated&quot; dichotomy anymore.<p>And finally: If you need to do something that is not interesting, work hard on finding a part of it that is, first. That might be your entrance to finding it interesting again (or at least you get that part solved).<p>If you can&#x27;t find anything like that, try redefining your entire approach (like &quot;I should try to write code that in turn writes my program&quot; or &quot;I am now forced to code this in LOLscript&quot;). It might end up seeming as just technological wanking (the usual &quot;engineer takes 12 hours to program software that solves a problem he could have done by hand in 3&quot;), but, heck, I&#x27;d rather do that than bore myself out of my mind.",1370987972

Most MEPs aren&#x27;t very widely know, though, even compared to members of the national assemblies. They also have the luxury of being in a sort of permanent opposition against national governments and the more powerful parts of the EU government.<p>I agree that the story is overblown, although the concern about the whole thing in Germany and all of Europe is obviously very real and hopefully will turn into a greater concern over what our own governments are doing. I hope a lot of conservatives are caught finger pointing in the next few days, if nothing else just to see them squirm when they&#x27;re supposed to wave through the next set of laws curtailing internet freedom.",1370987939

5864951,comment,5863463,5863463,55,0,greghinch,,,"These arguments always strike me as coming from people who don&#x27;t actually understand what design is. The folks who think that design is the font face, the weight of lines, the colors used. Those are all facets of design, but they are essentially just tools to accomplish the goal: experience and engagement. What you are noticing are just trends, and this is nothing new. Look back over the history of even just twentieth century graphic/print design, and you will see how marked trends define periods in time. The fact that one product or group uses the same or similar elements to another does not say that one is the copy of another, simply that they are both products of the same era.<p>I haven&#x27;t used iOS 7 yet, so I can&#x27;t say this with certainty, but based on my experience with Apple, I feel pretty confident to say that they may have integrated similar graphic motifs you&#x27;re familiar with from other platforms, but the end experience will be leaps and bounds better than others who&#x27;ve tried to implement the same elements.

5864926,comment,5861581,5861581,1,0,mladenkovacevic,,,"It is interesting to conjecture and theorize about the personality of the US intelligence community and just what price they are willing to pay to protect different types of information.<p>For example: I wonder how much of their secrecy is really about protecting American citizens. After the Boston bombings (and 9/11 for that matter) there seemed to be no secrecy about the bombers. All types of information came out: that Russian intelligence had warned them about these guys, that one of them had already been investigated by the FBI for something else. All the information coming out had this open, non-secret feel. Same for 9/11: we suddenly knew about the movements and actions of the terrorists for months prior to the World Trade acts. How they trained, how they hijacked the planes, how Bin Laden had engineering insight and knew that hitting the towers at a certain height would make them collapse.<p>PRISM seems murky as shit compared to that. It&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s dealing in a completely different type of information altogether. This is what makes me wonder about what percentage of PRISM-type surveillance is really about locating some band of terrorists training in some desert camp. The secrecy around it seems much more likely to protect the spies than the American people.<p>I do refuse to believe that the NSA employees are merciless warmongers looking to secretly destabilize nations and install puppet regimes while somehow profiting off of the anarchy that ensues (although a lot of US history is precisely that). I think most of them genuinely believe that they are doing good work that makes the world a safer place. But the personality of the organization they work for doesn&#x27;t fit the rest of the picture and I just wonder what it is they are told in order to feel that the secrecy is justified.",1370987156

It&#x27;s untenable if you don&#x27;t approach it properly.  This is true whether you&#x27;re using Excel, Python, LISP, or anything else.  Better tools can go a long way to help, but the ultimate answer is educating people on how to properly engineer systems.<p>On that last point - at DataNitro[1], we let people script Excel with Python, which is a better tool than VBA or than doing things by hand.  The result is that for a given level of complexity, you see fewer errors and more robust spreadsheets; but when you give people more power, they naturally build more sophisticated spreadsheets.  All else being equal, this might result in more, not fewer errors.<p>The great thing about introducing a new tool, though, is that there&#x27;s also a chance to introduce new ways of working.  Suddenly, people start building spreadsheets that work with version control and run unit tests.

A big thing about\nblackmail is that the victim \nvery much does not want to go\npublic, not even after they are\nbeing blackmailed.<p>Blackmail is a very old game\nand works very well, and mostly\nall that is needed to have a victim\nis someone who has a secret they\nvery much don&#x27;t want to have made\npublic that some potential blackmailer knows, and that \nsituation\napplies to a large\nfraction of the population.<p>Remember the old exchange:<p>&quot;If\nyou have nothing to hide, then\nyou have nothing to worry about.&quot;<p>with the response<p>&quot;Nearly everyone has something to hide.&quot;<p>With the Verizon data, IRS data,\nand financial record data, have a good\nshot at blackmailing any of a \nsignificant \nfraction of the whole population.\nAs many dictatorships have shown,\nwith such efforts, can have a\nlarge fraction of the population\nunder the thumb of the dictatorship\nacting as informants, moles, etc.\nin the population.<p>It can all be close to mafia techniques:\nA low level mafia guy who has done\nsomething illegal then has to remain\nloyal to the family or face the\npolice for his crime.  So, early\nin a blackmail attempt, get the \nvictim to do something illegal,\nand then forever threaten to\nturn them over to the police.<p>Again, it&#x27;s all very old stuff,\nand the Verizon data, IRS data,\nand financial data could enable\noceans of it.",1370986006

In my view, your three requirements (usable without a big learning curve, intuitive to non-programmers, equally or more efficient than Excel) point directly back to the spreadsheet UI. Spreadsheet users <i>get</i> spreadsheets in a way they don&#x27;t get anything else. It&#x27;s their mental model and they love it and there&#x27;s no way they&#x27;re going to give it up. (In particular, there&#x27;s no way they&#x27;re going to migrate to even the simplest of general-purpose scripting languages.) Therefore the only thing that will get them off Excel is a new kind of spreadsheet. The question is, what would that look like? If it&#x27;s too different from Excel, it won&#x27;t meet your three requirements. But if it&#x27;s too like Excel, there won&#x27;t be any reason to use it, nor will it address Excel&#x27;s limitations which are the subject of the OP.

Am I happy with these changes? Sure, the same way I&#x27;m happy that Mac OS X has finally fixed the multiple-display bug that has plagued it for 3 years. But these (long overdue) changes a bold OS do not make. And perhaps the argument is that Apple is not trying to make a bold new OS. <i>However</i>, that is definitely what it is presenting iOS 7 as, so I feel that I have a right to disagree.<p>I think the community in general has felt that iOS 7 was Apple&#x27;s chance to respond to the criticisms (fair or not) that iOS was stagnating, and I feel that that is what Apple feels it has accomplished. I feel they have done so in the shallowest way possible. To me they presented a corporate image of playing catchup: catching up to Windows and Android visual design cues, catching up to jailbreak experiments that have been happening for years, catching up to interactions we saw in Web OS ages ago. I&#x27;m not saying they shouldn&#x27;t have done this, I&#x27;m saying that in my eyes these are bug fixes and there exists an Apple that pushed further. There are a million things I wish Safari did every single day that I use it, and quite frankly &quot;3d tab organization&quot; is not one of them.<p>This is my point, I think people are not seeing the actual usability improvements that could have taken place. You think design is more than just visual stuff, its usability. I agree, I just think its more than making things take 3 taps less. Remember the original iPhone and iOS, it was a completely different way of interacting with your phone that allowed you to do NEW things you couldn&#x27;t before. Google is now exploring real new territory with their excellent services like Google Now. If Apple wants to keep fighting services and infrastructure with &quot;design&quot;, that&#x27;s fine, but its going to require more than endlessly spinning its wheels trying to figure out the &quot;best&quot; weather interface possible and micro-optimizing insignificant interactions with the OS.",1370984717

Inside they found her diary, which detailed her life and job in New York- which she shouldn&#x27;t have had, because she was repeatedly entering the country on a tourist visa. She was rejected at the border.<p>This may well be the same- even if the girl did not intend to show those messages to the border control agents, they can search her suitcase for evidence to then later present to her. So, to the extent that the word &quot;provided&quot; does not also imply &quot;voluntarily&quot;, I suspect you&#x27;re right.",1370984605

Sectoolmarket is a good resource with results from WIVET (crawl tests more or less) and WAVSEP (detecting vulnerabilities).

5864712,comment,5862195,5862723,12,0,spikels,,,"I agree completely. NPR is as good as it gets on US radio or TV (the competition is very weak) but has a decidedly pro-establishment and pro-government bias. This will make them particularly conflicted on the spying issue.<p>This should not be surprising. NPR is based in DC - a company town where the company is the US government. Many of their employees are relatives or friends of government officials or are even former government employees (for example [1]). Most of these relationships are not well known or reported. All of this is in addition to the normal reporter conflicts of having to report on your ongoing sources. Just imagine how uncomfortable it would be to report a negative story about your husband, brother, friend, former colleague or regular source who happens to be a senator.<p>On top of that NPR is funded by corporations, people and foundations with strong ties to government (Comcast, Soros, Catto Foundation) as well as receiving direct government funding [2]. You don&#x27;t bite the hand that feed you.<p>Lastly NPR like most US news organizations has a moderate liberal bias [3,4]. So with a Democratic administration currently in office NPR will be particularly sympathetic to the administration&#x27;s viewpoint.<p>All these factors will make it very difficult for NPR to cover this story fairly. This will show up in both visible actions, such as attacking the Guardian reporter [5, AP too [6]]. But even more so in what does not make it on the air. I&#x27;m sure many NPR editors would like to leave this uncomfortable business behind as soon as possible. At least we can continue count on NPR to be an excellent source of the government&#x27;s views.<p>[1] Michelle Norris is married to a senior advisor to Obama campaign[a].\n<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/post/nprs-michele-norris-steps-down-husband-broderick-johnson-gets-obama-job/2011/10/24/gIQAy7zrCM_blog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/post/nprs-...</a><p>[2] Partial list of NPR sponsors (couldn&#x27;t find anything after 2008).\n<a href=""http://www.npr.org/about/aboutnpr/annualreports/NPRSponsorsDonors08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/about/aboutnpr/annualreports/NPRSponsorsD...</a><p>[3] Juan Williams termination report.\n<a href=""http://www.npr.org/about/press/2011/010611.ReviewOfJuanWilliamsTermination.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/about/press/2011/010611.ReviewOfJuanWilli...</a><p>[4] NPR fundraising exec sting.\n<a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/03/09/134358398/in-video-npr-exec-slams-tea-party-questions-need-for-federal-funds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/03/09/134358398/in-...</a><p>[5] NPR examines Guardian reporter who broke PRISM story.\n<a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/06/11/190670954/he-broke-the-nsa-leaks-story-but-just-who-is-glenn-greenwald"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/06/11/190670954/he-...</a><p>[6] AP examines Guardian reporters bias [b].\n<a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=190571323"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1905713...</a><p>a-More on Michelle Norris&#x27;s husband, Broderick Johnson (also former AT&T lobbyist).\n<a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=18554"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=1855...</a><p>b-Another unreported relationship: Mika Brzezinski (co-host of Morning Joe) is the daughter of former Nation Security Advisor and current Ambassador to Sweden Zbigniew Brzezinski.",1370984593

3252890,comment,3252656,3252776,33,0,tycho77,,,"Okay. I'll try and explain why you're being downvoted.<p>Every time someone wealthy donates a whole lot of money to a philanthropic cause, people like you pop up in the comment section. ""Oh it doesn't matter, it's only X% of his net worth, that's the same as me only donating Y"". Seriously, you followed this template almost to the letter.<p>First, charity isn't a competition over who can sacrifice the most. At the end of the day, that $500,000 helps Wikipedia five thousand times more than your $100. More, probably, because his donation raises the profile and will convince others to donate. Second, people aren't ""expected"" to give anything, regardless of how much money they have.<p>I think the thing that annoys me the most is how obvious it is you came in here with preconceived anti-rich notions and then did mental gymnastics to convince yourself that you're ""a better person"" than this incredibly generous man. If you want to spread that kind of negativity around, go back to Slashdot.<p>I'm sure someone can articulate this better than I can, but seriously. These sorts of posts just piss me off.",1321642779

Some stories are likely to shoot to the top of the front page regardless of their competition.

It's his money, he earned it, and if he chooses to give it to charity or build a giant gold statue of himself it's his business. If there's anything he's <i>obliged</i> to pay out to others, it's already been taken care of, many times over, in the millions or billions of dollars in taxes which he has already paid, so as far as I'm concerned, let him do what he likes.<p>Now, of course, if he chooses to give any money at all to charity then that's very kind of him. And I'm sure he already has, and will continue to do so over the course of his life.

type of problem.  What you do is first use SELECT to see
the records in question:<p><pre><code>   SELECT * from some_table where idx >= 5

Then, once you are staring at the records that came back
(and are sure they are the ones you want to delete),
change SELECT * to DELETE (and change nothing else) and
rerun.<p><pre><code>   DELETE from some_table where idx >= 5

3252859,comment,3251757,3251757,6,0,gravitronic,,,"I did this last week.  It was my first time using google adwords, and I learnt a couple things.<p>Your ads: A ton of people will sign up for dropbox but not install the app, gaining you no benefit.  This is probably people looking for cloud storage without the computer rights to install apps I'm guessing.  My suggestion is to write in the ad copy itself that you have to download an app.  When I did this I got less clicks and a higher conversion rate.<p>Your bids: keep your bid low.  My first day, I kept bumping my bid and my daily budget, and ended up spending $50 of my credit and only getting a few completed referrals.  I was spending about $.80 CPC.  I reduced my budget to $20/day maxand reset the CPC bid to ""auto"" and adwords began bidding around $.08 max per click.  It took longer, but I only spent about $10/day and got a similar number of hits.  Even though when I browsed the adword campaign page it generally said it was not displaying any of my ads because my bid was low, I still accumulated ~80k views/day for around $10.<p>Your keywords: I got decent results using things like ""send large file free"", ""share large file free"", etc.  When I used keywords like ""dropbox"" I was usually outbid by someone else who had a higher CPC set up.<p>In the end I now have a 10GB dropbox account.  Aside from my wasting $50 the first day it cost me about $10/day for 3 days to accumulate enough referrals.",1321642446

3252856,comment,3249982,3252480,1,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""If I uploaded my music to Amazon Cloud I'd expect the recommendations could be better""</i><p>On the contrary, I think it gets far worse. Think about your <i>entire</i> music library. How much of it do you actively listen to? How much of it do you still care about? Or is it left over from those 6 months when you just can't get enough hiphop, and now you can't stand it anymore?<p>Tracking <i>recent</i> purchases will make for strong recommendations, since that's a good measure of where your tastes lie <i>right now</i>. Using your entire library (which is the <i>only</i> recommendation the Kindle can do) will inject a lot of noise, which is what happened to me (my entire library is on Cloud Player).<p>The whole thing <i>desperately</i> needs a Genius-like recommendation system. We <i>know</i> Amazon has the tech to do this, so why isn't there anything even remotely like it? Why is it that when I listen to music the UI is sparse and empty, and I'm <i>not</i> being upsold on relevant music?<p>Genius suffers from the same library-wide problem, but the difference is if you select a song, it will give you recommendations based solely on it. I've used this to discover new music a <i>lot</i>, and it works really well. Amazon desperately needs the same thing.<p>> <i>""I think they're still working on recommendations, the app is still quite basic.""</i><p>That really describes the entire device. You can see what they're getting at, but it's fallen so far short of the goal that it's sometimes infuriating how big the squandered opportunity is. Everything is ""quite basic"", and considering this is supposed to be the electronic gateway to all video, audio, periodical, and textual content... it does a <i>really</i> poor job <i>everywhere</i> of pushing content to you.",1321642424

My experience has shown me that the complete well-being of children directly correlates to the amount of time and love their parents invest in them, no matter how many siblings they have or far apart their ages may be.<p>Irresponsible parenting does not mean having many kids close in age. Irresponsible parenting simply means that you aren't willing to offer the time and love your kids need to thrive.<p>(edit for formatting)",1321642012

3252699,comment,3252178,3252570,21,0,ejames,,,"It is common practice for engineering to be explicitly forbidden from looking at any patent whatsoever.<p>A peculiarity of the U.S. patent system is that the size of the penalty is larger if the party accused of infringement is shown to have ""knowingly"" infringed.  This is intended to punish deliberate malign behavior more severely than accidental infringement, because there is a lower penalty if you didn't realize there was a patent to violate.<p>However, the second order effect is that accurate knowledge of patents is a legal liability.  When considering whether a party ""knows"" about a patent, any engineer in the company would count.  If Bob reads Patent A and Sally writes code that infringes Patent A, it's difficult for their company to prove that Bob never said anything to Sally.  And why even take on the burden of that proof?  As a practical matter, the potential legal cost of the larger infringement penalty outweighs the potential benefit of searching beforehand to ensure you aren't infringing.<p>When I joined Microsoft, part of the instructions given to all new employees was that you should never view any patent, anywhere, ever, no matter what.  Even if there is some reason why knowledge of patents is necessary, you should not try to search for or view those patents yourself, because if you look at a page of 50 patent search results to find the one you want, someone could argue you ""know"" about the other 49.  This is arguably ridiculous, but when your goal is reducing legal costs, you must avoid even the possibility of ridiculous arguments, because arguing back requires time from lawyers.<p>Standard operating procedure is for engineers to know nothing about patents and the legal department to make all patent-related decisions.  Naturally, the legal department makes those decisions with the goal of maximizing profit from lawsuits against other companies and minimizing loss from lawsuits by other companies.  The process deliberately and explicitly eliminates the possibility that accurate knowledge of software and hardware will be applied to patent decisions, because the only people with that knowledge are engineers, and letting engineers know about patents increases your legal risk.<p>Since the Patent Office also does not have the manpower or technical resources to make accurate decisions about engineering patents, and in any event is not incentivized to reject patent claims, patents on average bear no relation to reality.  They're determined entirely by what you can get away with in court.",1321640317

3252645,comment,3251133,3251673,5,0,billpatrianakos,,,"I agree. You really should look into SOPA though. The bill is dangerous in that it can be abused to shut down legit sites with hardly any evidence for infringement at all.<p>That said, I agree with your sentiment about the piracy supporters. A lot of people like to rant about freedom this and freedom that but it just doesn't hold up when you talk about piracy. There are a plethora of sites that do just blatantly rip off content producers, often times bragging about it (looking your way, Pirate Bay), while at the same time hiding behind the ideals of freedom.<p>No one will argue that the net is powerful and it's the freedom of the Internet that's a huge part of its power to empower people but we cannot sit and pretend that these sites should be left alone because that would hurt freedom. Yes, we do need to protect freedom for and on the Internet but using the freedom defense to argue for some of these sites is just ridiculous.<p>If I produce a piece of data that I charge for and it gets distributed freely on these sites without my authorization that is just plain wrong. No one is entitled to free music, movies, software, etc. they're just not unless it was the original intent of the author to give it away freely. This is real simple stuff and I can't see how people defend piracy like this. ""oh but the corporations are evil, they lock me in, restrict my freedom, whine whine, moan, moan"". Well you don't have to purposely hurt them or ""take them down"" just because you believe software, audio, video, whatever should be free. What you do is either use the alternatives made by like minded folks or create your own. Why force an agenda on the rest of us? That's extremism.<p>SOPA is a bad law and I'm ardently oppossed to it but let's not frame this issue like the poor underdog torrent/file sharing sites are championing freedom and good while the evil corporations are trying to enslave us all. It's just not so (at least in those terms, arguably). Piracy is illegal and has been since before the Internet. What part of distributing paid content on a worldwide scale for free is okay? This isn't about your belief that you're entitled to x, y, and z free. Its about this big ""evil"" corporations wanting to get paid when you use their product. They obviously are making things people want and enjoy otherwise it wouldn't be piracy that put them out of business, it'd be lack of sales and no one would even want to pirate their product, whatever the product may be.<p>There's too much talk about the obviously unethical file sharing sites. They're no angels themselves. So instead of framing it in their terms we should be framing it like this:<p>In an effort to stop piracy (which is not a bad thing) these large corporations and government officials are supporting a bill that has obvious potential for abuse and can hurt legit business owners or content providers in the process. The bill is over-reaching and can hurt future innovation.<p>Let's talk in those terms instead of defending known violators of existing laws.",1321639299

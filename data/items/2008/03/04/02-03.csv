Secondly this approach also makes it easier for voters to rate the article instantly without having to go back & forth to the news site.",1204599489

We can have a policy for a forum as a whole that aims to exclude trolls, and also develop <i>personal</i> skills to ignore them.

128516,comment,128439,128461,0,0,pg,,,"Watching what happened at Reddit convinced me that the solution is not to learn to disregard trolls, but to exclude them.  They poison the atmosphere of a community, and drive away the more thoughtful members.  And while you can make free speech arguments for them as you can for spam, in practice trolls are almost as distinct from other posters as spam is from ordinary email.<p>Every successful community has rules of conduct.  And rules are probably even more necessary when the members are anonymous.",1204597380

An even better theory book is Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Sipser, however it covers slightly different topics. It is one of the most readable theory books I've seen, highly recommended, and a great resource for information on regular languages, context-free grammars and turing machines.<p>A less theoretical book, that is useful for a gentle intro is Masting Algorithms with C.<p>A bit off the theory track, but useful for a software engineer: Modern Operating Systems by Tanenbaum and Computer Organization and Design for info on hardware.",1204597339

No matter how fascinating the results, if the model is wrong then there is no advancement in our knowledge of the brain.<p>As far as I know, they did not go the long and hard way of actually reconstructing a cortical column from sectioned tissue (as in electron microscopical imaging of serial sections of 60 nanometers in thickness).<p>What they have done, even if remarkable, is ""simply"" a simulation of a network built from statistical data gathered from many different studies of cortical columns.",1204597265

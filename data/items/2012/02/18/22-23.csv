3607974,comment,3606569,3607709,13,0,pash,,,"Serious reply to an unserious question:<p>In the common law tradition, land owners' property rights extended literally ""to the heavens"" [0]. Overflying someone's property (in a balloon, say) was legally a trespass. But in the United States land-owners' air rights were progressively diminished by the courts in deference to practical considerations as civil aviation developed in the first half of the last century. In 1946, in a ruling that is the basis of current law, the Supreme Court decided that a land-owner ""owns at least as much of the space above the ground as he can occupy or use in connection with the land,"" and invasions of that airspace ""are in the same category as invasions of the surface."" [1] Rights to the rest of the country's airspace appertain to the federal government.<p>So if your nemesis sends a drone into the space immediately over your property, you would likely have the same rights to respond as if he had sent a land-lubbing robot onto it. (Courts have ruled that a crane overhanging one's property constitutes a trespass, for instance.) Generally you would be able to seek an injunction against continued trespass and/or sue for damages under various torts (interference, nuisance, etc.). You probably would not have the right to shoot down the drone, unless perhaps you have reason to believe that the drone might do you serious harm and you are in a jurisdiction where some form of the Castle doctrine [2] applies.<p>Rights to airspace, and how they've changed over the years, are a great illustration of how property rights are not at all static but are continually rejiggered to fit the times. (Perhaps we can expect more tweaks as drones become common?) Michael Heller's book <i>Gridlock Economy</i> [3] has an interesting chapter on how rights to airspace have been adapted to allow for civil aviation. If you're super interested, there is at least one full-length book [4] (which I haven't read) on the history of the legal concept of airspace in the United States.<p>0. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuius_est_solum_eius_est_usque_ad_coelum_et_ad_inferos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuius_est_solum_eius_est_usque_...</a><p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Causby"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Causby</a><p>2. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_doctrine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_doctrine</a><p>3. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Gridlock-Economy-Ownership-Markets-Innovation/dp/0465029167"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Gridlock-Economy-Ownership-Markets-Inn...</a><p>4. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Who-Owns-Sky-Struggle-Airspace/dp/0674030826"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Who-Owns-Sky-Struggle-Airspace/dp/0674...</a>",1329605829

3607970,comment,3607217,3607790,1,0,nimblegorilla,,,"Interesting points, although I respectfully disagree.<p>It's pretty silly to talk about economics if you don't believe in rational economic actors. A public list is a nice theory, but then you would still have people trying to get on the list for the minimum amount possible and hoping that others would donate more to be higher on the list of donors. And what happens when you have 60 local farmers and 40 corporation farms. Most corporations would be pretty hard to shame into paying if they could somehow get others to pay.<p>Point #2 goes both ways. If the project becomes a net benefit then the dissenters get the benefit and win even though their judgement was incorrect.<p>Point #1 also goes both ways and points towards the need for public goods. In reality the sick farmer will benefit the most from public services such as dams and health care being shared by all of society. By sharing the cost of the dam and healthcare across all of the farmers they can help prevent one of them going bankrupt due to a bad case of cancer.<p>It's true that the government isn't better than everyone else at knowing which dams should built, but that doesn't mean that society can't figure out that some projects are best funded by the entire society.<p>Anyway - interesting perspective on your part.

3607952,comment,3607248,3607532,6,0,moonchrome,,,"I don't know Lisp, I only tried Clojure but I think this applies. I don't think it's about code as data per se as it is about the philosophy that there are no ""special cases"" outside the few special forms needed to bootstrap the language. This simplicity allows you to shape the language the way you want without having to consider the impact of your modifications on existing code. Consider the hell C# or Java teams have to go trough when they introduce things such as async, lambda, linq, etc. and how those features interact with the existing language. Consider implementing pattern matching for C# and all the edge cases. Even when if you had a open compiler it would be difficult. Python is no better, for eg. it has a rigid class/type model that has been abused more than once to provide metadata for ORM for eg. I once tried to extend a ORM functionality that was using metaclasses and multiple inheritance, the hell you go trough with metaclass ordering is insane, compared to writing a declarative DSL in clojure with a macro and leveraging existing ORM library. And consider when libraries overload operators to implement DSL's you immediately get in to problems with operator precedence. This problems don't go away even if you can redefine the precedence because it's not consistent with the rest of the language.<p>So what I'm saying complexity is significantly reduced when you have a small/consistent core. As for readability I think Clojure makes this better by providing different literals for vectors and maps and those literals have consistent meaning in similar situations so it provides nice visual cues. But immutability by default, clear scoping and functional programming make things like using significant whitespace and pretty conditional expression syntax bikesheding level details.",1329604788

I thing it's easier if you can focus full time on something instead of the learning being too much spread out.<p>So I talked to my boss and asked to work 4 days a week and have three days for learning and coding (with less salary of course). I did this for five months and my skills really improved.<p>After five months, it was clear for me I was ready to earn money from developing. So I stepped down as a Project Manager, had to give in some more salary and started as a programmer (junior).<p>It was one of the best decisions in my life.<p>For me, it's not relevant for the moment to stop working and study, because I learn so much working as a dev. But I can imagine myself stop working for a couple of months if I reach a plateau and want to focus and learn in a specific field.<p>It is a lot of fun to be able to focus on something and improve fast. So if you can afford it and you want it, I think you should do it. It's not only a lot of fun, but you probably be worth more on the job market.",1329604190

It's easy to not realise the difference in immersion if you're white (as I am) and the main character in games is the same as you. In ME1 I ended up going with an Indian main character, simply because I've never played a game which had an Indian protaganist. So it's not so much about stretching the suburbanites as allowing non-white-suburbanites to feel like it's accessible to them.<p>I also wonder how long it will be before main character voices can have their accents tailored - the Australian female lead in ME2 kept popping out like a sore thumb to me. Here in Aus it's weird to mix Australian and American accents in media. When watching US media, the accent is filtered out a bit and you can get immersed. When you get a mix like in ME2, I find it breaks immersion a bit. Hard to explain, but it's sort of like ""these characters are speaking in 'movie' voice, except this one which is speaking 'natural'"". A friend of mine was talking to an English teacher relating a story in a drama class in high school, where the kids had to write up some dialogue and present it.

If a big CA fucks up, they're either at the risk of being MITMed or of having half their secure sites stop working. If no CA had more than, say, 10% of the market, a fuck up would only affect a small number of the sites they use.",1329602471

Unlike other programs, absolutely everyone can get some direct benefit from the library - no matter what age or income level.<p>Libraries, in my opinion, are a model of what social services should look like: universally beneficial, only practical at the community level, little chance of moral hazard or conflict of interest by any party involved (don't return a book, you lose check out privileges - the only one hurt is the perp).<p>Next time you think of buying a book, seriously check out your local library system.",1329602462

All modern science bases itself on results being distributed, so other researches can validate or dismiss them.<p>May the terrorists du jour use those results? Of course, as they can also fund its own research and duplicate them. Someone researching a vaccine or treatment will depend on the publication of the results too, but the chance if them being able to proceed their work without the publication is lower.",1329602450

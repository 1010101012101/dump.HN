72931,comment,72922,72922,0,0,jaed,,,"MicroPlace.com just launched the other day and apparently actually allows you to charge a nominal interest rate so you can get a return on the loan. The point isn't to make oodles of money off of developing world entrepreneurs, but it is a slightly more attractive offer than Kiva's 0% interest loan. If you so decided, the interest you generate from MicroPlace could get then go back into another loan so the cycle continues again. Rinse, lather, repeat.",1193416715

Test them like any other investor would test you for fund-worthiness.<p>Find out what else they've done to demonstrate they are entrepreneur material.  Do a short trial project or two.  Pay close attention to how they react to different circumstances during the projects.  Challenge their ideas and see how they respond.  Ask yourself if you could really work well with them, and if they really improve the odds of success enough to merit becoming a significant shareholder.",1193414834

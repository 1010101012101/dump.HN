3157479,comment,3156524,3157244,4,0,bermanoid,,,"I'm curious here: what are the benefits of using a credit union over a bank?  What are the drawbacks?<p>Right now I keep 95% of my money in investment accounts (I use Interactive Brokers these days, they have reasonable fees for trades and zero bullshit, which puts them two steps ahead of any normal bank that I know of), and push the remaining stuff to a throwaway checking account @BoA as needed to cover recurring payments, bills, etc.  I don't have any sort of credit whatsoever, I've always preferred to pay up-front (and yes, this <i>has</i> been a problem, as I've gotten older I've realized that some things, like car rentals, are exceptionally difficult to deal with without a credit card, and getting a credit card is actually somewhat difficult if you skipped it for the first part of your life, and they really don't care how much money you have if you have no credit history...).<p>Trust me, I'd love nothing more than to know that I was contributing absolutely zero to the consumer banks.  But I've never really looked into alternatives; the main reason I use consumer banks is for convenience, like being able to set up bill payments, have a debit card, deposit checks at an ATM, etc.  Can credit unions cover those use cases?  And can someone like me, who's over 30 but has never borrowed money before, get into one?",1319611758

This is not <i>you</i>, it's just how you're feeling for a bit. Know that it will go up, and don't fight it up. Accept it, which helps.

Their price difference is way too fuzzy.<p>3) ""something they said was very unlikely given their current projections"" yeah...

3157437,comment,3156998,3156998,10,0,nbashaw,,,"I used to be a lot like that. But then somehow I slipped out of the cycle and started being good at things, and I've been truly consistently happy and working hard on fun projects for the past 3ish years (I'm 22 now). I saw some people asking others to share their stories, so I thought I would offer up my own life as an example. It's just a data point, take from it what you will.<p>When I started high school I thought I wasn't good at anything. I was pretty rebellious and took up smoking / drinking at a young age. Then I started debating and found out I was pretty good at that, but it wasn't enough to pull me out of my slump. Turns out, winning debates is only cool to other debaters. I remember riding the bus full of idiots to school, listening to Modest Mouse on my first iPod, just wondering why life generally sucked.<p>When I went to college I tried to be one of those thoughtful types. My subconscious goal was to make everyone think I was tormented by deep thoughts. It was my way of trying to get people to like me and to feel special. (I was not conscious of this at the time). I smoked cigarettes a lot, became a vegetarian, and thought about how nothing matters. Reading Nietzsche for fun made me feel profound, and truly I learned a lot from it, but if I'm honest with myself I did it because I wanted people to respect me.<p>That's what I was missing in my life, what made me feel so bad for so long. I just didn't feel respected. I didn't think people took me seriously enough. I quit college debate, joined another student organization and became known as a friendly and smart guy there. Almost overnight everything got better. As I started getting happier and more respected by my peers, I also started becoming more ambitious. I dreamed about becoming president one day, about starting massive companies, about changing history.<p>That was about 3 years ago, and I've been mostly happy since that point in my life. Gradually I shed my old bad habits, like smoking, and picked up some good ones, like eating healthier and exercising. I no longer want people to think of me as someone who is tormented by his genius. I realized that people really don't relate to or respond well to that. I still want to be respected, but now I'm capable of getting respect because I learned the first step is to be a warm person towards others - not by trying to project any sort of image. The problem is that we all project an image whether we want to or not, so we have a tendency to try and control it. I've found that I'm happiest and I feel most respected when I'm focusing on the matter at hand rather than myself. Whether it's designing an interface (my job) or talking to a friend, I find I am happiest when I'm not thinking about myself.<p>Hope this helps somebody who's feeling like I felt 4 years ago.",1319610593

But i think advice like this is almost as useful as ""Just be happy, the world has so much to offer!"" to a depressed person.<p>This cycle you described is something almost every human being on earth goes through, day to day. For some the down-phase is way stronger, crushing and exhausting, to an extent unimaginable for the rest. But still, everyone has it.<p>You made a good start by reflecting on the change-cycle of your feelings. Key is now to find a way to make best use of that knowledge in order to weaken the depression.<p>There are many different teachings that will help you find that wisdom.<p>Meditation (for example) can help you weaken that clinging for and aversion to 'good times' and 'bad times', resp. Clinging/Aversion itself is a very subtle process, which we usually don't notice consciously, but adds a lot to how our feelings turn out. 
Trying to be aware of it, gives you a whole new viewpoint of the status quo.",1319609564

It does not work if you're laying down horizontally on your back or on your side, nor when you bring it to a straight vertical for example. It seems to have a fairly narrow tolerance for the angle to which the phone must be brought in order to activate Siri, that being the angle at which you naturally hold a phone to make a call while sitting or standing straight up.

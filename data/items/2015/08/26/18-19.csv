I agree however there hasn&#x27;t been any analysis done on the situation of these claims.  for example how long after this lady returned was she put on a PIP? what were the terms of her PIP, as in what did she need to improve? did an insurance glitch happen to other people in the company or was it just her?<p>2. what policies have actually been violated? again no analysis has been done (publicly) for any of the existing claims.  if amazon does an analysis and finds that things were done according to policy and that policy is not out of the ordinary from other companies, they would have to divulge personal information about these employees which should not and I&#x27;m sure wont happen.  maybe the ceo of the company can instead make a broad public statement that this should not happen and that if it does happen to report it to him personally?<p>4. in the scope of how many people who currently or have ever worked at amazon, this is effectively one or two people.<p>5. they were too busy being sick to report why they got a bad performance review and what they did to improve it?<p>6. what? I said that no one has said what they feel is acceptable and no one has reported how long they were performing poorly.  of course one day is reduculous, but is 6 months?<p>7. now you&#x27;re following along with all the rhetoric. as others have reported, the anonymous reviews are usually used to provide good feedback and help people get promoted.  emails on weekends and midnight are just a random anecdote from the nyt article  that didnt go into much detail.  cut-throat backstabbing? that&#x27;s the first ive really heard of this.  survive or die? is that not true for every company out there?<p>8. just because it&#x27;s a company doesnt mean it can&#x27;t be a witch hunt.  additionally if you read the comments many people are demanding bezos&#x27; head on a pike.  regarding the culture, what about the people who do enjoy and thrive in that kind of culture?",1440615576

It was only after local police departments started getting a cut of civil asset forfeitures (they used to be sent to the FBI, I believe) that counties started abusing it.<p>There are surely other options too, such as spreading it out.

If customer reviews could be trusted to be authentic, people could look and see that the game is rated five stars and make their decision based on t trusted to be authentic, a lot of people would make their decision based on a game&#x27;s rating. Instead, app developers have gamed the system by paying for reviews (e.g., the infamous 2008 case of one developer earning hundreds of thousands in a single month after paying Amazon Mechanical Turk users to download his app and rate it 5 stars, among many others), etc.<p>The result is an unwillingness from many consumers to risk more than a single dollar for a game. I, for one, used to pay up to $10 for good games (e.g., I&#x27;ve purchased all 3 N.O.V.A. editions for $7.99 or so), but these days I am reluctant to even spend a dollar on an app.",1440615398

Like most advanced Western countries, its a modern mixed economy, which features some elements of capitalism -- a system named by its nineteenth century socialist critics for its focus on the interest of the capital-holding class -- but also mixes in many elements of socialism specifically to mitigate the very problems with capitalism that were identified by the critics that named it. This model has -- in a process that, while it started earlier and never really ended, was focused in the early-to-mid-20th Century -- displaced capitalism as the dominant system of the advanced economies of the world.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why a socialist would be less appropriate a leader for a country with a modern mixed economy than a capitalist.",1440615312

For example:<p>> What is pickling and unpickling?<p>> Pickle module accepts any Python object and converts it into a string representation and dumps it into a file by using dump function, this process is called pickling.  While the process of retrieving original Python objects from the stored string representation is called unpickling.<p>The first sentence is wrong. File objects, for example, cannot be pickled. Also, in Python3, which makes a stronger distinction between a &#x27;string&#x27; and &#x27;bytes&#x27;, a pickle returns bytes, not a string. Also, the pickle module can pickle to/from bytes without touching a file.<p>For another example:<p>> How will you compare two lists?<p>> cmp(list1, list2) − Compares elements of both lists.<p>The answer is &quot;list1 == list2&quot;, for most uses of &#x27;compare&#x27;. The &#x27;cmp&#x27; function is no longer part of Python, and its use was a bit tricky.<p>For a third:<p>> What are the rules for local and global variables in Python?<p>> If a variable is defined outside function then it is implicitly global. If variable is assigned new value inside the function means it is local.<p>This is not correct. Consider:<p><pre><code>    class Spam:\n        x = 5\n</code></pre>\nThe variable x is neither defined in a function nor is a global variable.<p>Looking through the answers, I would discourage people from using this site.

Right now, we expect individuals to take on that debt themselves, personally.<p>That has pretty terrible consequences for the individuals for whom the investment doesn&#x27;t pay off.<p>But if, in general it&#x27;s a good bet that paying to get someone educated will increase the value of their aggregate lifetime economic output, why shouldn&#x27;t the state be putting some money towards it? The government could borrow money at bond rates and use that to pay for a whole bunch of people to get degrees, and assume that the overall future increase in GDP (and consequent tax take) will be enough to pay back the additional borrowing. An the bonus? Even if there are some people who don&#x27;t realize the potential economic advantage of their education, on aggregate the bet wins (if you frame it right and make sure the funding went to real degrees with real value, of course).<p>This is the problem with most rhetoric around government debt. Not all government spending is a write-off - some of it (infrastructure spending, spending on education, R&D funding, international development funding) is an investment in future potential. If an investment is worth making, it&#x27;s even more worthwhile making it with borrowed money. If the government is borrowing money to pay for medical care for seniors, maybe we have a problem.

If both arguments have equal probabilities this simplifies to simply appending the argument as a prefix. If the probabilities are unequal, you can save bits (entropy) by bundling frequently occurring arguments together in the Huffman scheme, at the cost of increased decoding complexity. I heard bandwidth/cache sizes is a much greater problem than circuit area though.<p>You are right that you need to parse all previous instructions to get an offset. Again, this is far from my area of expertise (first time I read about CPU design), but it seems this problem could easily be alleviated by slight modifications to Huffman codes, for example by setting &quot;blocks&quot; of instructions of certain sizes and assigning a prefix to each block containing the number of instructions in each -- you then can get offsets very quickly.",1440613885

For example, it&#x27;s often not worth it to work for a startup, even if you get that %0.5 equity at the $10mm valuation, since even if it gets to a $1 billion valuation, it doesn&#x27;t mean you can sell it.<p>Dilution would then make that $50k into $500k instead of the $5 million you would expect.  $500k / 4 = $125k / yr (vesting), which is the same as working at google / apple if you could sell all of your stock.  But you cannot so you probably will not get that money back.  So a very good case scenario for startups can lead to getting the same money as working at google.<p>With the current trend of 8+ years to liquidity if the company is successful, it will be a long time before you get your $50k back.  Then you have to compare putting that held up $50k in to an index fund over the same 8 years.<p>As a result, you should probably be demanding something like %5 of the company.

When are we going to wake up and realize that this is normal human behaviour - regardless of whether you&#x27;re happy about that or accept it or not, this is the case.<p>I agree with those who say leave this behind closed doors. If marriages fall to pieces because of this, that is between them. But to publically name and shame people because their [non-criminal and not-concerning-you] actions don&#x27;t jive with your morals [Perhaps politicians would be an exception to my perspective on this] is inexcusable. Not many are going to die because someone cheats on their spouse - even if they&#x27;re caught.

You need an actor without a profit motive, and government is it.<p>That&#x27;s a really common talking point for single-payer healthcare, but it unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t hold up under scrutiny. Government-run agencies have the exact same incentives for profit as private companies do, even if they don&#x27;t use the terms &quot;profit&quot;, &quot;margin&quot;, and &quot;P/E ratio&quot;.<p>Ironically, the closest thing we have to single-payer healthcare model is Medicare[0], which absolutely <i>does</i> have all the problems associated with a profit motive. In many ways, it&#x27;s <i>worse</i>, because Medicare is able to set prices across the board by fiat, is not required to negotiate with providers, and is essentially mandatory for providers (so providers just have to swallow whatever reimbursement rates Medicare offers). As a result, providers make an operating <i>loss</i> on Medicare patients[1], to the tune of 7% nationwide.<p>Think about it from Medicare&#x27;s perspective. You have to balance your books at the end of the year. Do you either (1) ask Congress to raise taxes to increase your budget and hope they act quickly, or (2) lower the price you decide to pay for services, knowing that it will have <i>zero</i> impact on whether or not providers will still perform services for you? Unsurprisingly, they choose (2).<p>Also, ironically, most patients who are happy with their Medicare plans[2] are actually using privately managed Medicare plans anyway. So they&#x27;re essentially opting into profit-driven insurance anyway, with the only difference being that their premiums are being &quot;subsidized&quot; by their past tax withholdings.<p>[0] There&#x27;s also the VA, but single-payer advocates usually balk at that comparison since the VA actually operates the medical practice itself, unlike the single-payer models typically proposed.<p>[1] This means that they make a loss even <i>before</i> accounting for any overhead, such as salaries, or markup.<p>[2] And at the rate that MA is increasing, pretty soon the majority of <i>all</i> Medicare patients altogether.",1440612557

Seems like they would have a lot to lose letting this go to court, even if they intend to drag it out.<p>But that&#x27;s the thing: they don&#x27;t need to let it go to court, they just have to drag out the pre-trial proceedings for a few years until you&#x27;ve either moved on with your life or forgotten enough of the details. Most cases settle out of court, but before that happens there is due process that a good HR defense attorney can absolutely stretch out for years.<p>As far as their lawyers, it costs a big company like Amazon very little, since the lawyers are likely on salary. They would probably hire an outside attorney to represent them in person at a trial, but since the vast majority (>95%) of cases settle before they make it that far, their internal HR lawyers would probably handle most of the grunt work of filing paperwork until someone actually needs to show up at the court house.<p>Also it&#x27;s probably not as much money as you think; unless it can be proven that the company&#x27;s actions were malicious and intentional against a protected class, you probably won&#x27;t see much more than 6 months salary.

Hires a group to do that function. The group grows and its bifurcated into sub-groups which each have a part of the problem, and each has their own &quot;success metric&quot; which should, in theory, contribute up to the top level metric. However, there are no &#x27;peer ranking&#x27; of the metrics, so if you have one group that is keeping your HR costs under control (success metric is &#x27;cost per employee&#x27;) and you have another group with is keeping your employee&#x27;s happy (success metric is &#x27;employee retention&#x27;) and a third group which is keeping employees productive (success metric &#x27;revenue per employee&#x27;), they all sum up, in theory to success metric &#x27;keeping people happy and productive at the lowest possible cost&#x27;.<p>Now you find an employee who discloses a condition which will both cost the company money (benefit payout), and reduce productivity (external issues, loss of focus at work) and suddenly two parts of the HR group are having their success metric impacted by this event. You can reduce that to only one group making the person quit. So from the top level &quot;we&#x27;re hitting two of our three metrics&quot; is a better report to send up then &quot;we&#x27;re hitting one of our three metrics&quot;.<p>A fix for this is an suitably enlightened senior manager providing scale options, so &quot;retain good employee&quot; gets a weight of &#x27;6&#x27; and &#x27;save money&#x27; 2, and &#x27;productivity&#x27; 3. Now when you score it retaining them gets you 6/11 but getting them to quit only gets you 5/11. Retaining your best employees becomes the managed-to goal.<p>Understanding how a company approaches those problems will say a lot about the quality of its management and the maturity of its processes.",1440612025

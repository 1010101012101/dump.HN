Acrobat Reader is free, and they don't put ads in there.<p>On top of that, they say that the cost of creating documents is ""free"".  What?  Are they handing out free Word licenses with this thing or something?  Because last time I checked, the price of creating a document for iPaper is the cost of the program that makes the original document for iPaper.  As you stated yourself, ""converting"" to iPaper is free.  So yeah, if all your documents are TXT files then this thing is free, but if you want any semblance of structure in your document then you're probably using... you guessed it, DOC or PDF.  There are plenty of free PDF converters out there (plugins for Word, built-in support in Mac OS X, standalone programs, etc etc).  So I think at best iPaper is even with PDF in this regard.<p>Tangentially, PDF is not ""bulky and painful"".  It just happens that Acrobat Reader is a ridiculously awful reader.  Mac OS X handles PDFs like a breeze, they feel incredibly light weight as they open instantly and any application can output to them.  So I whole-heartedly agree that Reader is a <i>bad</i> program, but don't extrapolate that to the format.",1203459578

119224,comment,118991,119210,0,0,boucher,,,"""Can Acrobat Reader convert/read documents not in PDF format""<p>No.  As such, this is a legitimate point for iPaper to make.  They support more formats.  Of course, many of the document creation programs do support conversion to PDF, but this is still a nice thing about iPaper.<p>But, it has nothing to do with the cost of creating documents.  The cost to create an iPaper document is not zero, its undefined.  You cannot create a document in iPaper, period.  You <i>must</i> create that document some other way, be it MS Office, Adobe Acrobat, or one of their free alternatives, or a text editor.<p>If anything, they're advertising the cost to share a document.  Which is free for every other type of document too, unless that person doesn't have a program to read the given file format, which is obviously the real thing iPaper should be trying to sell users on.",1203459502

It seems silly to give up that carrot without extracting some sort of concession, particularly as the post-Fidel government may be more amenable to compromise.<p>If the US were to unilaterally lift the embargo without any movement by the Cuban government then it's not clear whether that would accelerate or decelerate the cause of human rights. However, making a deal has got to at least be worth a try, assuming our goal is a Cuba where people can speak freely, travel freely, own property, vote in freely contested elections, use the internet, and start businesses (to bring the topic back round to something marginally relevant to HN).",1203459132

I know at this point xobni ""show only a fraction of what we want to do""... but since most of us only have a 15 minute attention span, I hope you guys do it quick... :)

I wasn't quite sure everyone would automatically censor me for the idea, so I was testing the water.<p>I think mentioning controversial subjects should be alright, like if someone wanted to know what I would pursue if given the means, but debates about them should be done offline.",1190363651

If there is one thing I think should be censored here it is the intelligent design debate. The entire movement is one big troll that feeds off of its own debate. Let's start marking it dead on arrival.",1190362604

This problem is so prevalent that it's hard to deny it exists.<p>Our first product, Xobni Insight and Xobni Analytics, only the surface of what can be done, and show only a fraction of what we want to do. Building these initial products didn't take millions. But extending Xobni and building a large and happy userbase will.",1190362591

57864,comment,56626,56972,0,0,olavk,,,"The compatibility problems are not in the core language (which is surprisingly portable between browsers), but in the DOM API. This can be solved by a compatibility layer library like JQuery, Prototoype et al. 
Joel claims that this layer slows JS an order of magnitude, which is greatly exaggerated. The difference between calling the DOM directly and through a library is barely noticeable.
A very clever compiler could probably optimize some overhead away (e.g. transforming into browsers specific code with the compatibility layer optimized away), but I doubt there would be any major gain speed-wise.",1190362098
57863,comment,57785,57849,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"I believe that ID gets unfairly maligned.  As a scientific theory it is a basic statement about probabilities.  Simply stated: the probability that life could have evolved to its current state by way of Darwinian evolution is so low as to be a nearly a mathematical impossibility.  (Simply calculate the probability that each of the necessary factors for intelligent human life came to exist and multiply these numbers together.  You arrive at an extremely small number, less even than 1 in 10^60.)  This statement allows that the universe has an infinite time frame for such evolution to have occurred.  ID also points out that recent astronomical findings date the universe to about 14 billion years old, thus significantly curtailing the theoretical maximum time allowable for that evolution to occur in.  Now tell me, what makes that claim pseudo-scientific?",1190362052

We call them names and they respond to names. They sometimes know their name. It&#x27;s a different kind of &#x27;have&#x27; than having a tail. I have a name for my dog. Should the person class have a dogs_name member variable now?&quot; A tail is a subset of a dog. A name is a property of the abstract system in which the dog resides.<p>A class is a model of something else. You can model a dog with an object, but you can&#x27;t know how good of a model it is unless you dig down into it and see where it breaks down. It <i>will</i> break down, because software is an abstraction, and abstractions, being abstract, are <i>not</i> the things they are abstractions of. And there are not many things that behave like OO objects because they are far too simple to represent reality in any high-fidelity sense. And it&#x27;s dishonest to pretend they do.<p>Not to say there isn&#x27;t some pedagogical advantage to using the analogy, I just think a better one could be used.

10567984,comment,10566335,10567627,0,0,muraiki,,,"That person asked for someone to &quot;Please explain the harrowing of hell&quot;. I tried to explain a view that is held by a large number of Christians and which has precedence in the early church; this is important in this instance because there is only a single verse in the New Testament about the harrowing of Hades, and it gives very few details. Thus, most of what we have is the tradition taught by the Church.<p>When it comes to the diverse views among Christians, here are two things to consider:<p>1) St. Paul in the NT says &quot;hold fast to the traditions you have been taught, whether by word or by letter.&quot; This indicates, along with historical evidence, that a substantial body of Christian teaching lies _outside_ of the written documents of the New Testament. In as much as some people try to use &quot;the Bible alone,&quot; we can see that this results in a tremendous amount of conflicting teachings. It&#x27;s of note that the New Testament did not even exist in a definitive compiled form until a few hundred years into the history of the Christian Church.<p>2) Ultimately, for Christians the Word of God is a person, not a book. The God-man Christ did not issue a new set of laws, but took on flesh and taught by example how to live. The Christian is concerned with understanding this Person, and people are much more difficult to describe than laws.<p>So for the Christian, while the Bible is of course an important guide, it does not represent the totality of Christian teaching. And since this teaching is about a Person, and especially a Person who does not simply say &quot;do X in Y situation,&quot; we can come across some conflicting views.<p>It is the goal of the Church in every generation to help the people of God to know Christ given the unique circumstances of each generation, without veering off into craziness that jeopardizes their love of God and neighbor. Ultimately it is up to the individual priest or bishop to exercise the right balance between akriveia (precision) and economia (house building) in each particular situation. For the priest it is more about the daily lives of parishioners, and for bishops about the actual teaching of the Church.<p>Anyways, this is starting to turn into an essay, and for that I apologize. But it is necessary to understand the details of the things we are talking about if we are to really talk about them. I do not say this to offend you, but out of recognition that many here are probably unacquainted with or have sadly had bad experiences with religion. To the degree that I can use my background in religious studies and my experience across various religions to help explain things, I am trying to do so.",1447548359

I don&#x27;t remember all the mods, but migrating from 4 to 6 was a nice undertaking, and it was done in parts. People who worked there will remember the term &quot;4 on 6&quot;. After the migration, the kernel was 6 (and you got the latest drivers) but we were still running those weird 4 user-land binaries.<p>Inktomi (YST) was acquired in 2003, later Overture (YSM) and both were linux shops. YST was the biggest property by far and we didn&#x27;t have any kernel developers. We were doing just fine with stock debian, then stock RHEL. (I did a few very minor patches for 32-bit, like splitting user-space/kernel to 3.5/0.5G instead of 3/1G, and some caching improvements for /proc, but I wasn&#x27;t a kernel developer). Linux just worked. Drivers were available and supported for the HW we needed. Oprofile, systemtap worked fine for the most part. We later hired one kernel developer to help Mail move to linux, but we always had more freebsd kernel developers.<p>For freebsd you needed to write the drivers and the tools. That took time and money. The community was also smaller and it was harder to hire people with experience. Acquisitions were running on linux too.<p>The decision was not easy.

I&#x27;m not saying that &quot;popular things are bad&quot; but rather that &quot;popular things <i>can be</i> bad&quot; and that quality is mostly orthogonal to popularity. There&#x27;s no more conflict in saying that Go is bad despite its popularity any more than there is in saying that Big Macs are poor quality food. (Which are, of course, developed by leading minds at one of the largest food processing corporations in the world...)<p>There&#x27;s been some fascinating research in this regard, finding that things get popular based on social factors (namely the shape of the social graph) coupled with some amount of random change, largely removed from any intrinsic qualities of the thing in question[1].<p>Another annoying thing this article—and similar ones like it—does is conflate &quot;different&quot; and &quot;unfamiliar&quot; with &quot;complex&quot;. Even if you don&#x27;t understand it, the Haskell type system is <i>not</i> complex: it&#x27;s a slight elaboration of the lambda calculus which can be <i>fully</i> described on half a piece of paper with type theoretic notation which translates to <i>maybe</i> a page or two of prose. (Which is only needed to provide some general background information.) Haskell <i>really</i> does boil down to a simple kernel like this which is even used by the compiler (as an intermediate form called &quot;Core&quot;). Everything else is just syntax sugar, usually in transparent ways.<p>In a similar vein, the article conflates <i>simplicity of implementation</i> with <i>simplicity of language</i>. The two diverge as soon as you start caring about performance—performance breaks all abstractions. That&#x27;s the only reason GHC is complicated; writing an <i>interpreter</i> for Haskell is actually probably <i>easier</i> than Go because, again, it&#x27;s just the lambda calculus. That&#x27;s literally something we teach <i>freshman</i> in a general-purpose intro course (SICP[2]). It&#x27;s easier to understand what a Haskell program means because of this; it&#x27;s only harder once you start worrying about low-level optimization. The dynamic semantics of Haskell—what happens as an expression is evaluated—can largely be summed up in a <i>single</i> rule describing function application. That&#x27;s it! Even if you find it difficult, which is understandable, it is <i>not complex</i>; difficulty is as much a function of your background as anything else.<p>Popularity is a terrible way of evaluating programming languages on anything but their popularity. Simplicity of implementation <i>is not</i> simplicity in general. This article is decidedly unconvincing.<p>[1]: Here&#x27;s a nice summary with references to peer-reviewed studies: <a href=""http://nautil.us/issue/5/fame/homo-narrativus-and-the-trouble-with-fame"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nautil.us/issue/5/fame/homo-narrativus-and-the-troubl...</a><p>[2]: <i>The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i>, an book introducing CS still used at many universities and available free online: <a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/</a>",1447547951

Wouldn&#x27;t it be cheaper to just throw another feature in there while we&#x27;re at it? That has to be cheaper than building a whole other system right? What is missing in that original function is how adding in the requirement for countdown clocks powered by CBTC increases the cost of CBTC itself. This plays out over dozens of features big and small, and next thing you know you have the F-35.<p>I&#x27;m relatively familiar with this story already so I wasn&#x27;t shocked by the countdown clock portion of the system. I think everyone at the MTA knows that you could build a system that just provided countdown clocks for passengers for not that much money. Keep in mind the ATS system they mention that powers the A division countdown clocks is actually as safety critical as CBTC and therefore is engineered (and priced) like an airliner. It&#x27;s not priced like an Arduino broadcasting the trains location to receivers that guesstimate when the trains will arrive but only works 95% of the time.<p>The real meat of the story for me is that the MTA doesn&#x27;t have a realistic plan for rolling out CBTC at all. They basically have the constraint of never shutting down a subway for a significant period of time, and also that to realize the savings from CBTC you have to eliminate the block control system from that stretch of line. It seems like they can&#x27;t make a hybrid system work unless it covers the entire line (that&#x27;s why they started with the L).<p>I think if they work on that core problem the whole thing becomes tractable. How do you safely manage the transition of a train from a CBTC &quot;block&quot; to the old style block? If they do that then you can start at the end of the line and incrementally rip out the old system and put in CBTC through weekend work. They were able to replace the entirety of the 7 line&#x27;s trackage in about 2 summers, and if they didn&#x27;t have replace the old style signals it sounds like it&#x27;s not much more work than that to bring in CBTC.",1447547181

I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever, in my life, wondered what the &#x27;founder&#x27; of my religion would do. I highly doubt most people do, and I&#x27;d like to see some evidence - some research - showing that it influences more than a tiny fraction.<p>Well, Islam has an entire tradition called the &quot;Sunnah&quot;, which can be loosely described as the life and actions of Muhammed.  According to any school of Islam with which I am familiar, with the possible exception of certain Sufi sects, <i>all</i> Muslims are categorically instructed to follow the example of Muhammed as the first and foremost example of a &quot;correct&quot; Muslim.  In fact, according to Sunnis (one of the two main branches of Islam), the Sunnah are an &quot;official&quot; source of Islam, along with the Qu&#x27;ran.<p>Also, Evangelical Christians have a thing called W.W.J.D., or What Would Jesus Do.  If you&#x27;re in the US, you&#x27;ve undoubtably heard of it.  Many Christians wear pendants, bracelets, and put on bumper stickers with these initials.<p>So in short, order, those are two pieces of evidence I&#x27;d put forward of a religion&#x27;s adherents aspiring to do what their religion&#x27;s founder would do.  You may disagree with the parent&#x27;s conclusions (I&#x27;m not even sure I do, but since it&#x27;s been flagged I can&#x27;t re-read it to say), it&#x27;s decidedly not based in ignorance.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to your religion, but I can assure you that among very, very large numbers of Muslims and Christians, the life of their religion&#x27;s founder has a huge impact on how they go about life.  I have to wonder how many religious Muslims or Evangelical Christians you&#x27;ve known that this is even a question in your mind.<p>Also, I find it odd that you called someone&#x27;s reasoning &quot;ignorant&quot; who is clearly at least somewhat familiar with Islam and the Qu&#x27;ran, when you yourself admit to reading &quot;little&quot; of the Qu&#x27;ran.<p>PS: Since you were looking for good translations of the Qu&#x27;ran in your other comment in this thread, I highly recommend Ahmed Ali&#x27;s, Arberry is fairly painful and hard to read.  Also Muhammed Asad&#x27;s.  Although both are accused of being impartial translators, that&#x27;s mostly by the extremist or at least conservative wing of the religion and I doubt many people here care about that.",1447547153

Much is wording that could go either way, and some depends on what the reporter actually saw. For example, maybe the reporter can&#x27;t identify who threw the rocks and so can&#x27;t say anything about them. Maybe the reporter saw a scuffle and not a riot; the NR critic doesn&#x27;t offer evidence that the statement is in error. <i>In general</i>, it&#x27;s an old propaganda technique: Just keep up a flood of criticism and people will think that some of it - just a little! - must be true. It&#x27;s not. Professionals in the field of political maniuplation really do pull this stunt on a regular basis. Look how they demonize every Democratic leader, for example (Bill Clinton, Hillary, Obama). (Left-wingers do the same, but they have far less influence than platforms like Fox News, the Wall Street Journal&#x27;s editorial page, and Rush - all the most popular in their industries.)<p>2) The National Review has an avowed agenda of pro-conservative, anti-everything else commentary.

The problem is worse on websites which have no such rule regarding whether something is actionable or not (well, they did use to - blue and purple links - but apparently that doesn&#x27;t look cool enough any more).<p>Much worse for me is the invention of a bunch of new UI elements which seem to have no known rules about how they work (Apple Music app - the word &quot;songs&quot; is actually a drop down list to change how the list below it is grouped into artist or album? What?!). Or huge numbers of functionality hidden behind a random choice of long press, force touch, context menu, swipe left or right, or double tap. E.g.: Safari on iOS: long press the reload key to load the desktop site, or type a word in the address bar and scroll down to &quot;find in page&quot;.

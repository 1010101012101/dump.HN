The awesome thing about BJJ is you don't need to be very athletic to be good. Its also a very practical art and you'll get to spar everyday. In terms of self development, BJJ will crush your soul and teach you what your ego is all about.

Though there are some particular events that are new (for instance, the ""no significant warming"" quote being propagated without the statistical details that show that the quote is anything but anti-AGW), they contribute nothing to humanity's understanding of AGW, much less to this specific community.<p>That said, I continue to try to engage the HN community on the issue of climate change because I feel that if climate denialism is seen as acceptable by HN, that we as a community have very little ground to stand upon when we say that we are skeptics. Indeed, it seems to me that what <i>is</i> new is that the denialist mode of thought is gaining acceptance here at HN, and I think that presents us with the very real danger of a ""herd mentality,"" as you aptly put it.<p>Once the basic issue of tone and community standards has been established more firmly, then that opens the floodgates for actual news, such as startups making money by making it easier to reduce CO₂ omissions, or about the wonderful hacks (and I use that word very fondly!) that scientists use to make observations. The basic issue of whether climate change is real is a decided and non-newsworthy issue, but there's a wealth of awesome HN stories in how we as a global society deal with it.",1267394032

We were taught things like if you get into an altercation (non physical) it's best just to leave because that guy that stormed off might just be looking for a weapon or friends or liquid bravery. If someone wants to mug you give them your money. If they want your car give them your keys. No one gets into a fight unless they feel pretty confident about winning - maybe it's because they are much bigger than you or maybe its because they have a knife, a gun, or 4 friends. It's generally better to not find out which.<p>That being said, if you do end up having to defend yourself we were taught to disable them then back away quickly. Ideally, don't turn your back to them and run. The only thing I'd really be aiming to break is their will to get back up and come at me.",1267391423

For instance, imagine Kuwait produces oil, and Japan produces automobiles.  Kuwait trades oil to country America for automobiles.  Now imagine Japan enters the market and makes automobiles that are much better and cheaper than America's.  Kuwait will now start buying automobiles from Kuwait instead of America.  America will find the price of oil skyrocketing and it's standard of living collapsing, unless it can produce automobiles that match the quality and price of Japan's automobiles.",1267391051

I wanted to use the SIMILE Timeline widget awhile back for a corporate project, and found that IE (any version) had the text-select problem, which was problematic for the ""enterprise"" standard browser.<p>Now I'm even experiencing it in Firefox.

Unless the CDN threw some extra code in, which someone would eventually notice (seriously marring the company's reputation), it doesn't send any info to the company hosting the code.<p>But it is a good point. You should make sure you really trust the company hosting the code for you.<p>Edit: Oh, right.

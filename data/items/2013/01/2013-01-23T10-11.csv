And they should be.<p>That said, I think many of us have been missing the point with this site. The cryptography they provide allows for plausible deniability. No more, no less. They are perfectly able to view the contents of your uploads, and they never denied that. If you want truly private and secure files, then encrypt them yourself prior to uploading them.<p>The scope of this particular flaw (which, again, can be fixed transparently) is that you don't only need to trust Mega, you need to trust their CDNs as well. Neither of these levels of trust is enough if you truly are concerned about the privacy of your files.<p>It can only be considered a flaw in the first place because Mega claims to be the only party you need to trust and attempted to provide a means to ensure that. It just so happens that version 0 of this implementation does not work.<p>Then, fail0verflow goes ahead and say that since they have made this mistake they don't understand cryptography and should not be trusted to store your stuff. I'm sorry but that's bollocks. This system is big enough so absolutely anyone can make a stupid mistake or 2. Cryptography is just one element. A red herring IMO, being completely honest. If you are storing sensitive data don't let them do all the work and encrypt it yourself. Or just don't upload it to the cloud at all.<p>Absolutely everybody makes stupid mistakes and a single stupid mistake does not prove anything. I'd ask them to come down from their high horse because breaking a system is a lot less work than creating one. Especially when working under tight deadlines.",1358938600

There are many ways to get compromised, and different ways to mitigate the attacks.<p>If security was that black and white (security or no security) we would all have to use air-gap networks. There would be no internet, no REST APIs, no trusted SSL CAs, we wouldn't be able to use anything. For convenience we accept a certain amount of security risk. The risk we accept, and the security measures we take, are entirely dependent on the sensitivity of the data and the threats we expect to deal with.<p>If the NSA and CIA are after you, nothing is secure, they can physically break in and steal your systems, they have world class cryptographers and a stockpile of zero-day attacks to create trojans with.<p>But for most of us you don't have to worry about the NSA coming after us.

5102361,comment,5102064,5102064,14,0,acabal,,,"Milestone release vs. rolling release is a red herring.  The real problem is the issue of shared libraries and shared dependencies.  This is one thing Windows got right--updating one program (usually) doesn't affect other programs on the system.  But in Linux, updating one library or program might introduce bugs into all of the programs using it.  Hence was born the milestone concept, where we freeze a known stable state of the entire system and use that, because all the interdependent clockwork seems to work ok at that point; and then the rolling release concept, where we acknowledge the need for new software, but update everything, top to bottom, so frequently that breakage is common.<p>These approaches have the added side effect of making the distro the curator of the galaxy of 3rd-party software running on it.  I find this the most surprising thing--why should the OS provider have to spend the energy curating every single well-known program that runs on the OS?<p>What we really need is a reform in the way dependencies and packages are managed so we can update one aspect of the system (Firefox, Pidgin, etc.) and not drag in new versions of libraries that can introduce bugs in to other parts of the system.  Gobo Linux started edging towards this approach but it's sadly no longer maintained.<p>An approach that combines a stable core--kernel, video/network drivers, etc.--that is thoroughly tested and rarely updated, plus sandboxed apps that update at their own pace and are not curated by the distro maintainer, would be the ideal approach, I think.  We could even keep the concept of centrally-sourced packages.<p>Is this possible given that Ubuntu inherits Debian, or given the general philosophy and practices of OSS?  Maybe not.  But it'd go a really long way towards assuaging the constant and unforgivable breakage that happens with every new Ubuntu release.

I'd love to hear some guesses about how well they've done so far.<p>I tried to estimate their return on Reddit (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=4474),"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=4474),</a> but couldn't find even a ballpark number for the sale (paul? ;) ). My best guess is that they did great, but not stratospheric. With Kiko selling for 200K, they can't have done much more than break even.<p>Perhaps seed money has different economics than later stage VC money, which traditionally looks for 10x return on 10%(+) of companies. Are they  getting in early in hopes of getting 100x return on 1%(+) of companies?",1174330216

Because the remainder will quit over the treatment of the employees in a.)<p>VCs often like to install their own people in key positions within their newly funded companies.  Oftentimes, the people they replace are well-respected nonconformists.  The replacements are well-connected incompetents.  There's nothing more demoralizing than some moron in a suit taking over for the guy who's helped you a hundred times.",1174328596

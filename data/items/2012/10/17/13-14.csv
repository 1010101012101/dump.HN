Come on) now to write it from scratch is not worth it unless it's like, a half hour thing you already know how to do. Now what <i>would</i> be worth it is if you already had a solution that you don't mind selling. Like the zip example, supposing I'd already written something like that the five minutes to look at it, make sure it works, maybe tweak it for 10/15 minutes to suit what they want and then upload it for 25 bucks seems worth it especially since I'd guess the majority of people posting bounties are going to take the first working example.<p>tl;dr: post code you already wrote and then get a coffee with the proceeds.",1350482380

4664390,comment,4653370,4659872,1,0,white_devil,,,"You, sir, are an ENRAGED SHEEP, and as such, it's difficult to discuss reality with you when you're hell-bent on rejecting it.<p>> If you do not have the (sound, defensible) numbers to point it out, what you have are personal anecdotes, not evidence.<p>You're still stuck on the numbers, and the lack of ""statistical rigor"" in the way I used them. Fine, let's just forget about the numbers.<p>As I already mentioned, the fact of the matter is that every non-sheep Finn KNOWS that Somalis rape women. It's just the way it is. We KNOW that the media tries to cover up the fact that Somalis are most often the perpetrators in cases of rape. We KNOW that whenever a bunch of ""Younglings"" gang-raped a woman, it was Somalis.<p>What would you expect from a culture that considers women men's property? They believe that if a woman is showing too much skin, she's <i>asking to get raped</i>. I heard this first-hand from a Pakistani colleague I befriended back when I was still a sheep too. Not only that, but if she wants anyone to get convicted, she needs <i>four pious Muslim MEN</i> as witnesses for the rape, and if she goes to the police station to complain about getting raped, the <i>police may just decide to rape her too, just for funzies</i> (or because she's ""filthy"" or whatever the official, Islam-sanctioned excuse was). Yeah. Not every single goddamn time, but it does happen.<p>It's just obvious that Muslims are more rapey than your average white Westerner (or any other non-Muslim).<p>Now, at this point, feel free to howl about ""painting with a broad brush"" or how Not All Of Them (tm) rape women, and so on. Not ALL of them bury their daughters alive for showing too much skin. No, but it constitutes a noteworthy phenomenon, and the observation can be made that Muslims are a group of people who do that (to whatever relatively-small-but-nevertheless-fucking-insane extent it happens).<p><i>So in other words, you believe Somalis rape 34x more than the general population, but you don't actually have proof of it. The fact that you would readily believe that one group rapes a whole 34x more than another group, without skepticism or wanting to verify the facts, reveals a great deal about what you wish to believe.</i><p>Yes, I'm willing to believe a factor of 34. But even if my ""estimate"" is wrong by half, it's still a massive factor of 17. Would you believe I was off by half? Even if we discounted a huge mistake like being off by 50%, it would <i>still</i> leave a massive factor of over-representation.<p>Again, it's just a fact that they <i>are</i> more rapey than non-Muslims. I can't just whip out <i>proof</i> for that claim, because rapes by Somalis specifically are not listed (even though they are for those handful of other groups) in those statistics. Not only that, but the media censorship of Somali rapes kind of gets in the way of <i>proving</i> anything.<p><i>And here's a little riddle for you: if the stats here are organized by significance (see how significant contributing nationalities are separated out?), why aren't the Somalis separated out? You would think that a rate over 34x more than the general population, contributing to a huge portion of rapes in the country, would bear its own column, no?</i><p>Here's another right back at you: If our government instructs our media to cover up Somalis' crimes, do you think they'd just give us the statistics that would make them blindingly obvious?<p>Can I personally <i>prove</i> the censorship to you right now? No, not really. But I KNOW it happens. You can't hinge everything on proof that is - or would be - provided by a government. All governments lie to their little tax cows. You want <i>proof</i> of that? Well, you can't have it.<p>You know, I <i>used to be</i> an innocent, well-meaning sheep like you. I used to be quite enthusiastic about the idea that we're all equal and we're all ""the same"" and that we should all just live together in peace and harmony, but then, gradually, I was faced with Reality, and had to adjust my views on things. That's the thing. You need to be <i>capable of adjusting your views on things</i> whenever the need arises.<p>But it's in our nature as human beings to reject any changes, cling to our preconceived notions and dislike/resent anything that represents Otherness. Because of that, different races just aren't destined to get along. Saying that doesn't mean I hate black people just for being black, it means I'm aware of this particular aspect of reality.<p>> Do you really believe that in the entire country of Finland there are only thirteen non-Finnish nationalities represented?<p>How well do you know Finland? -Not particularly, obviously. Do you have any idea how homogenous our population still is? Before 1990, there weren't any Somalis here.<p>Even in 2011, the people who speak something other than Finnish or Swedish (or Lappish) comprised only 4.5% of the population: <a href=""http://www.stat.fi/til/vaerak/2011/vaerak_2011_2012-03-16_tau_001_en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stat.fi/til/vaerak/2011/vaerak_2011_2012-03-16_ta...</a><p>So when the chart I originally posted says: ""The largest groups by native language 2001 and 2011"", there's no reason to interpret it as: ""The largest groups by native language 2001 and 2011 (EXCEPT FOR LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE WE LEFT OUT)""<p><i>Yet where is your proof? You have offered ZERO evidence. You would think that if Somalis really raped women at a rate OVER THIRTY TIMES the national average, that you can find some iota of evidence? You would think that this would appear as a distinct column in your stats - after all, it points out much smaller national groups!</i><p>You just keep yammering on and on about evidence.<p>Here's an idea: <i>You should vote for Obama because he's The Good Guy, and Romney is The Bad Guy. You want The Good Guy to win, right?</i><p>Here's another: <i>Your country's real, actual unemployment rate is 7.9%.</i>  (Do you think you can <i>prove</i> this by pointing to BLS statistics? --> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbfttPAj66k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbfttPAj66k</a> )<p><i>The massive bank bailouts and ""stimulus"" ever since 2008 have helped, and your economy is now on the path to prosperity!</i><p><i>Spain doesn't need a bailout! After all, Mr. Rajoy told us so!</i><p>You're free to believe all of that, but if you do, you are a clueless sheep. Most people in the world are, of course, and it's not <i>your fault</i> - you've been brainwashed into it, after all. But it is <i>your</i> mission, should you choose to accept it, to start seeing and accepting Reality for what it is.<p>Or, you could just keep on <i>raging</i> and bleating angrily at anyone who says anything that goes against your Rainbows & Unicorns view of the world.<p>By the way, here's another racial group in Finland that's a bit too active in the crime department: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Kale#Perceived_violence_and_criminality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Kale#Perceived_violence...</a> ..<p>> in 2005, persons of Romani background (who make up less than 0.2% of the total population of Finland[1]) perpetrated 18% of solved street robbery crimes in Finland<p>So a group of people that represents 0.2% of the population perpetrated 18% of the street robberies in Finland. Want <i>proof</i> of that? I haven't got any, but having lived all my life in Finland, it's <i>very</i> easy for me to believe it. This is a group of people that performs the <i>vast</i> majority of shoplifting too. I can't cite any statistics for that either, but I've personally seen them wander around a department store, just picking stuff up and putting it into their pockets. Want <i>proof</i> of that? Sorry, I don't have the security camera footage. But this is yet another thing that's <i>common knowledge</i> in Finland, and this time even Sheeple would agree, with a sheepish grin on their faces.<p>Now, here's something you should think about <i>really fucking hard</i>: Is it RACIST to point this stuff out? Or is it, you know, just.. describing Reality? But whenever someone describes a part of reality you're not comfortable with, you label them racist or whatever-ist and then proceed to rage at them.<p>>  - by way of comparison, Somalis were responsible for 12%, while ethnic Finns were close to 51%.<p>Well well well, who do we have here? So Somalis commit 12% of all street robberies in Finland? But..  but..  they're such a lovely and upstanding group of model citizens! That simply CAN'T be true!<p><i>But no, you are far more racist than I even suspected. For the love of God I hope we never meet.</i><p>Ah, because then you'd just HAVE to beat me into a bloody pulp in the name of Justice! Right?<p>That's sweet. I hope we never meet too. Who knows, maybe I'm a <i>filthy misogynist</i> too, so beating me into a pulp just wouldn't suffice - you'd have to straight up <i>kill me</i>.<p>All in the name of  Righteousness and Justice, of course. Killing me would be your civic duty as a Good Person.<p><i>You are by far the most racist person I've ever conversed with, and I've seen some racist shit on this side of the ocean. The fact that people like you exist makes me depressed.</i><p>Well, Mr. White Knight, you just might be the <i>most enraged sheep</i> I've ever conversed with. I guess that makes us even. You know, there are actually people on Hacker News that live in reality. Sometimes you even see them speak about it, and somehow miraculously <i>not</i> get downvoted into oblivion by a herd of enraged sheeple, so I thought some of that might have rubbed off on you.

I partially agree with some of the points Tierney is making, but some are just wrong.<p>I really do not like the CollegeBoard, especially how they have the monopoly on standardized testing. If you want to get into any respectable college you must go through them and take the SAT, or at least some AP courses. They really are a for-profit ""non-profit"" company, where they squeeze as much money from you as possible. Yes, grading tests takes money, but at $89/exam, it's cost prohibitive for those from low-income families.<p>However, in my college search over the past year or so, I haven't seen a college that doesn't accept at least some form of AP credit. I have talked to some students that, while helpful, an AP class doesn't replace an introductory course (computer science, for example).<p>At my school, about 80% of students take at least <em>one</em> AP class over their four years. So, at least for me, I haven't found that AP classes are smaller. They are in fact larger than lower level honors courses, sometimes much more so.<p>The point where I truly agree with Tierney is where he says the AP courses cover too much too quickly. I live in Connecticut, and we start school about a month later than schools in the south and southeast. However, everyone takes the tests at the same time. This puts us at a huge disadvantagewe have to learn the same material in a much shorter time frame. This also makes it so we can't do much that interests us as a class. For example, in European History we'd take the time to do mock trials, debates, discussions, etc., but we simply don't have the time for that before the AP exam. Of course, we have about a month of school after the AP exam where we can do whatever we'd like, but that doesn't help us take the test.<p>While I don't think students will stop taking AP classes in the future, it would certainly be nice to have an organization that cares about the student to administer them. The CollegeBoard really is not looking out for the student, but for themselves.",1350481510

Zepto's remove() does not.<p>But the most dangerous assumption the author made is that it will unbind events from the model. It does nothing of the sort - you need to manually override remove() in your views to detach any event listeners on models/collections/views/routers. If you don't do this, the views will still exist in memory, consider the following:<p><pre><code>    var Model = new Backbone.Model();\n    var View = new (Backbone.View.extend({\n        initialize: function () {\n            Model.on(""change"", this.render, this);\n        }\n    })();\n    View.remove();\n    console.log(Model._callbacks);\n</code></pre>\nIf you dig into the Model._callbacks object you'll eventually find the View instance, still referenced (and so still in memory). The simple way to fix this would be to add this remove function to the view:<p><pre><code>    remove: function () {\n        Model.off(this);\n        return Backbone.View.prototype.remove.call(this);\n    }</code></pre>",1350479779

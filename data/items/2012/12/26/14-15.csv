I wouldn't be so quick to assume that it's an aesthetic design decision  I bet it's more of a cultural preference.<p>I don't like flat sinks, but I can see how some people do. In Lebanon they generally build large flat sinks right into the countertop with the same marble. They are much larger than most American sectioned sinks and are good for certain things. They use a small squeegee to clean up after everything is done.",1356533991

I don't remember any scifi movies where the characters had to dual-boot their refrigerators because the main OS kept track of your food supply but another OS had the software for calorie counting.<p>When you tell any normal person ""that software doesn't work on this computer"" they'll only stare back at you confused. It really doesn't make any sense and it should be the #1 priority for software development going forward.",1356533984

4969391,comment,4969187,4969187,8,0,neya,,,"I'm so glad that someone is writing about this issue. It is important to understand that 12.04 and 12.10 both SUCK.<p>Here's why:\nPreviously I was on 10.04, the best thing that happened to me ever. Boot speed was amazing and shutdown speed was the fastest among the three OS'es I had then (Windows Vista, OSX, Ubuntu 10.04).<p>Then something happened. I purchased the Windows 8 Upgrade edition and I had to partition my drives (because I wanted to) and I thought ""you know what? Let me upgrade my Ubuntu, it's been sometime since I upgraded it."" I upgraded it to 12.10 and I used it as my only OS before installing Windows 8 (because the setup was corrupted and I had to re-download it).<p>It was a nightmare. Unity is a nightmare. Before using 12.10, I was on 11.x and 12.04. I don't see why they have to thrust Unity onto your face. Everything was really fine before Unity came.<p>Unity is one of the poorest experience one could ever experience on any operating system. I'm not sure if it was inspired from some other OS, but whatever it is, it's a poor implementation and clearly no proper research has gone into designing Unity. For example, switching between open program windows is a nightmare, if you have auto-hide enabled, it just gets worse. If you are a developer, nothing could get even worse than trying to switch between a text editor and a web browser, for instance.<p>Now to the core, the OS itself is painfully slow. Post installation of Windows 8, I compared the boot and shut down times of both the OS'es. I'm not exaggerating here, but Windows 8 shuts down much much quicker than 12.10. The only reason I loved Ubuntu was for its speed, let alone security. Now what Canoncial has done is taken the only reason for me to use Ubuntu and bastardized it as much as they could. Video drivers are another issue. Back on 10.04, I had to manually install Nvidia drivers myself, but it would work well once installed. 12.10 just fucked it up big time. It would automatically try to install something and you will have to spend sleepless nights trying to remove it and install the correct driver only to realize that it wouldn't work either!<p>I know you can bring back Gnome using some terminal commands, but the speed of the OS itself is still slow. Try switching between tabs on Chrome, you'll realize what I mean.<p>Ubuntu's target audience has always been developers and power users first, and everyone else next. With Unity, they're <i>trying</i> to push Ubuntu towards general users, which will be a difficult task. Moving away from your target audience to attract a newer audience is the worst strategy I could ever think of.<p>Hence, here's another Bye-bye from me to Ubuntu. Hello Windows 8! (single boot!).",1356533975

I started using linux on the desktop in 1999 part time, and moved 'full time' by ... 2003 I think.<p>I gave up around 2008.  Gave up trying to migrate friends/family; gave up being an evangelist.  The number of things that wouldn't work on someone's hardware was always greater than my ability to help/google/patch/whatever.  And I got sick of:<p><pre><code>  1) works for me.\n  2) research your hardware first(!)\n  3) build your own machine\n  4) this latest release version X ""just works""\n  5) other tired canards you've already heard.\n</code></pre>\nI've no doubt that for some people, some distros 'just work'.  They never did for me.<p>Perhaps it was my hardware (the 6 different laptops and desktops I rotated through during 5 years apparently just never hit that magical elusive sweet spot of 'just working').<p>Perhaps my expectations were different - I'd like to have two different apps running at the same time and both play sound at the same time - pidgin/gaim would constantly lock the sound so that nothing else could play, causing no sounds and sometimes crashes.<p>I've got other stories - everyone does - but got tired.  I went mac full time in 2008 and have a good balance of a system that lets me run osx with windows and linux in virtual machines when I need them.  It's certainly not perfect - I have occasional crashes, that stupid beach ball, and I miss the FISH protocol in Konqueror something mad.  But... I get far more actual <i>work</i> done on this system than I ever did on Linux systems.<p>Other people will have opposite experiences - good for them - I just wish people would quit blaming the ""linux on the desktop"" defectors as if they'd  done something 'wrong'.  The only thing most of them did 'wrong' was to believe the hype for too long.",1356533077

Sure, <i>Linux</i> works much better on laptops then it used to, but what good is that since the software provided by <i>distributions</i> is less stable and of a lower quality then it was 12 years ago. It's all anecdotal evidence, but I've had far more success 10 years ago introducing Linux to non-so-technical users, previously exposed only to Windows 95/98, by using a default Gnome/KDE environment then I'm having now introducing them to recent versions of Unity/KDE/Gnome.<p>Linux became worse when the commercial alternatives only got better.<p>This website under Chrome under Ubuntu 12.10 (Unity): <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/oUTwi.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/oUTwi.png</a><p>This website under Chrome under Mac OS X 10.8.2: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/UwTl8.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/UwTl8.png</a><p>This is completely unacceptable as a default experience.<p>(edit: grammar; screenshots)",1356531974

The parent didn't specify 'libertarian' or some other form of free will, and it's hard to specify what it means without resorting to handwaving.<p>The implied meaning I read was that if a person has no free will, there is no opportunity for them to change what they do. In truth, they are not free to change what they do, or even free to change what they will. Any appearance of such is an illusion.<p>If we accept that this is what not having a free will means, then it should be clear that, given we have no free will (our assumption from before), whether a person thinks that they have a free will or thinks that they do not have a free will makes no difference, as someone with no free will has no opportunity to change what they do.<p>Regardless of all that, I think kernel of the idea is a good one. Even if we are deterministic machines with no free will of any kind, we still experience out lives and should enjoy them. Thinking about if we have any oversight of our brain, able to determine the direction we want it to take is a foolish one, driven by the disconnect between what we experience and what we know about the mechanics of our minds. We <i>are</i> our brain, and everything else around it, and what it does is exactly what we are doing. We have the capacity to shape what we think and do as much as any other learning machine, but we are not an outside entity looking in.<p>My favourite quote about these ideas is this, and I have no idea where it comes from: ""If nothing matters, then the statement 'nothing matters' doesn't matter, so you might as well forget about it and enjoy yourself.""",1356531910

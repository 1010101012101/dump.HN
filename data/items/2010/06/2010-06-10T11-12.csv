1419749,comment,1418755,1419427,0,0,roel_v,,,"Considering that you bring up the 'rough sex' twice, and in a way that makes it seem like the books are full of it and that sex forms a fundamental part of the stories and philosophy, I wonder what it is that makes this single one-page scene in one book the center piece of many reflections on her books on general. If it weren't for that one movie (was it ""Cruel Intentions""?) I would've mostly forgotten about that passage. This may be because what is considered ""highbrow literature"" in my mother tongue (Dutch) contains (relative to English-language literature) a lot more sex, and in much more explicit and colorful ways (e.g. Jan Wolkers but also work by Belgians like Jef Geeraerts), and that reading works like these since early adolescence has blunted my sensitivity to this topic; but still - even when I try to abstract from that personal frame of reference, I find it hard to assign to them the weight that is often done (and that you are implying)<p>On top of that, I resent your attempt at an ad hominem by suggesting that the main audience is sexually hypertensive adolescents. Which is a shame because the rest of your post is sound (even if I don't agree with all of it), and the sophism detracts from that.",1276171021

Currently, most common processors have a cache line size of 64 bytes, so nowadays it's quite likely that Judy is a fair bit faster.  Further, the processor is old enough that memory delays were (while still important) perhaps less of a big deal than they are now: the relative latency of RAM to processor speed wasn't as bad.<p>Yes, this does highlight the problem with such heavily optimised structures - that they are somewhat hardware specific - but it doesn't mean that this is an accurate demonstration of the performance improvement you'd see nowadays.",1276170575

Unless the Apple execs have gotten <i>very</i> stupid recently, they probably understand that not only would the EU and the US regulatory agency would pay them a visit if they even initiated the move of buying ARM, doing that kind of withholding would land them in scorching hot water.<p>It's one thing to have strange practices when you're the second or third player on the smartphone market (and basically non-existent in the wider mobile phone market in terms of number of units), it's another one to have anti-competitive practices when you have a monopoly on mobile chips.<p>And ARM most definitely has that, there are few if any other architecture for mobile/embedded systems at all, and ARM has pretty much all of the market for mid to top-end embedded stuff.",1276167772

Perhaps if we're having a discussion of an author's political philosophy as it relates to current tech-oriented issues. Otherwise, I don't necessarily see the relevance for HN.",1276167745

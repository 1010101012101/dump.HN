You'll also do several projects.<p>Also Godel, Escher, Bach is really more a popular science book, isn't it? Enjoyable read that it was (when I was a teenager), I think it is actually more confusing than actually helpful in understanding the underlying concepts.",1222412116

315807,comment,363,363,0,0,iigs,,,"When replying to a comment in a thread (the parent being a comment, as opposed to a comment like this, where the parent is the article) it would be neat to have the article link available above the reply box (as in the article-parent case).<p>Several times in the past week I have clicked on a thread, read the thread for comments, clicked the article link to read, clicked back, and then hit ""reply"" on a comment. Half way through formulating a comment I think ""oh, I wonder if the article touched on $foo"" and then have to either unwind the stack or open a new tab to news.yc and retrace my steps. Being able to control-click from the comment page would be ++handy.<p>Thanks for the site, really enjoy it.",1222410805

With a wife, 3 kids and a mortgage, the first concern if/when we all commit full-time, is continuing to keep up with all of these responsibilities. My wife’s supportive of what we want to achieve, but we’ll see what happens if/when reality bites.  It’s an extra hurdle to leap, but it’s manageable.",1222410798

I'm planning on leaving it there under JPMorgan's rule unless they offer me less.<p>From my reading (because I can't call it research yet), WaMu's fall was triggered/multiplied by a lot of withdrawals from their customers because of fears that this would happen (chicken/egg). In fact, $19 billion was supposedly withdrawn over the past few weeks, which put them under their loan ratio (banks must maintain a certain cash/loans ratio). Of course it now makes sense that they offer such a great interest rate - they needed the money!<p>My concern now is what will happen to my interest rate?",1222409923

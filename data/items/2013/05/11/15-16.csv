5690995,comment,5690555,5690924,1,0,klibertp,,,"My first contact with compiler writing was through a book, I forgot the title, where the guy explained how to write a compiler for pascal-like language for some specific, non-x86 processor (I forgot which; I only remember that it wasn't anything I'd heard of). The book was very amusing and made me realize how simple the idea of compilers is - I was somewhat proficient with assembly then and after a few illustrative examples it all ""clicked"". Needless to say, the parser was handwritten and expanded when another construct was added to the language, so it was the simplest and lowest-overhead possible.<p>Anyway, compilers and interpreters ideas are very simple and powerful and beautiful because of that. There is no magic, however magical their workings may seem from the higher level :)",1368287920

I run a UI/UX studio here in Toronto and we go all up and down the spectrum, with some clients being shocked at our prices for web design/development but we've also lost jobs from other prospective clients because our prices were too low (no joke).<p>It depends on two things:<p><pre><code>  1. Where you get your business\n\n  2. Who your competition is\n</code></pre>\nFor many, #2 depends on #1. We see three main sources of business: Google (we rank highly for 'Toronto web design'), Dribbble (we have the 2nd most followers in Toronto, and 8th in Canada), and of course, referrals.<p>Dribbble leaves us with clients with the biggest budgets, who aren't afraid of 5-figure prices for web design. This is where we're competing with other high-end designers and thus our prices are more in-line with theirs.<p>Referrals are the strongest leads, with clients who when they don't have larger budgets are more comfortable stretching a bit because of our strong work for a friend or mutual acquaintance (and we're often happy to mark down a bit for a referral).<p>Leads from Google are where the clients who get really shocked come in; they don't really understand or appreciate the work that needs to go into good, iterative, considered UI/UX (and the custom development that goes along with it). The competition here includes a swath of companies who game SEO and outsource work offshore, and they can charge considerably less. Thus, our prices look unreasonably higher to the untrained eye.<p>There's also a phenomenon where cheaper clients expect <i>more</i>. If you move up in terms of positioning yourself as premium, better clients will consider you and your services-- the types of clients who aren't shocked by ""high prices"" for design and/or development.<p>So, if you find all of your clients are shocked at your prices, you're not marketing towards the right clients.<p>I would also highly recommend listening to patio11's podcast #3 about making more as a consultant: <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/10/10/kalzumeus-podcast-3-growing-consulting-practices-with-brennan-dunn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/10/10/kalzumeus-podcast-3-grow...</a>, and charging more <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/09/21/ramit-sethi-and-patrick-mckenzie-on-why-your-customers-would-be-happier-if-you-charged-more/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/09/21/ramit-sethi-and-patrick-...</a>",1368285231

If you're really nuts about avoiding cache hits, you can pack most ref counts into the low bits of the class pointer, since allocations tend to be 16-byte aligned, including allocations for class objects. Assuming you use the object at least once following a change of ownership, the overall cost in cache misses becomes 0. Or you can store the references in a global table with better cache properties (IIRC this is what ObjC does). Or you can rely on the fact that cache lines are typically large enough to grab a few words at a time, so fetching the class pointer will automatically fetch the refcount (again with the assumption that you use objects at least once per assignment). Honestly, I'm having difficulty imagining how cache behavior could become a problem unless you wanted it to.<p>As for not allowing cycles, I consider that a feature. The headache of memory management doesn't go away with GC. You still have to avoid inadvertently keeping references to objects through the undo stack & so on. Unintentional strong refs creep through GC code just as easily as memory leaks creep through code with manual memory management. Almost universally, I find that GC'd projects large enough to have memory management best practices implicitly do away with this freedom at the first opportunity by calling for acyclic or single-parent object ownership graphs. These restrictions primarily make it easier to think about object lifecycle -- the fact that they allow refcounting to suffice for memory management is icing on the cake.",1368285210

Like Dell in its heyday, they put all of their energies into minimizing their costs.<p>With no brand to speak of, they have no incentive to differentiate other than to avoid lawyers. If one of them changed the bezel and it didn't work, they'd go out of business. If it did work, everyone else would copy them and they wouldn't get any additional sales or margin, since they don't have a brand name.<p>The people who <i>out</i> to be differentiating are companies like Samsung, not these bottom feeders.",1368284945

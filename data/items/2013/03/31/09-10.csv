5468236,comment,5466759,5466950,2,0,swombat,,,"But, as pointed out by others, PhD/academia dynamics are heavily skewed by the fact that you have to do a PhD, then work as a postgrad for ages, before you get to run your own experiments. If you don't let anyone do anything but work on other people's experiments until they're 35, of course you won't get many great innovators below 30.<p>If anything, the fact that the average age of academic innovators is 38 rather than 60 means that there is a large preponderance of innovations in those few years between 30 and 38, to balance out the fact that most academics in a position to innovate are older than 38.<p>However, that's still using a fairly loose definition of innovator... arguably, people rewarded by Nobel prizes are not innovators, they're inventors. They've come up with something wholly new, and rightly deserve much credit for it. Innovators, however, are often those who take something new invented by someone else and actually bring it to the wider world.<p>The classic example of an innovator is, of course, Steve Jobs - didn't invent any of the stuff Apple is known for, whether mp3 players, smart phones, tablets, or even the original Apple II (invented by Woz), but damn was he good at getting it market-ready and then getting people to know about it.",1364723805
5468235,comment,5467874,5468223,3,0,gfodor,,,"Yes, but do you build better products? In my own experience success or failure is essentially non-correlated with applying deep creative thinking or raw hypothesis hill climbing. Both seem to work in different circumstances. The lean startup method claims that it's anti-correlated since you will fall into the trap of acting on poor assumptions. But guess what, sometimes your assumptions are right and you have a unique perspective to create something almost nobody else would think to.<p>Also, in my experience it's the subset of successful products that involved more creative thinking that I am most proud of and look back on my time working on more positively. Hell, this is even true for some of the failures. The raw hypothesis driven successes were high-five worthy, but not pride-worthy (other than perhaps a pat on the back for demonstrating my faith in the Church of Science), and the failures tended to be fairly painful since the work itself was unrewarding intrinsically and the outcome was negative. Nothing is really worse than hacking out code in misery because, counter to your intuition and your gut, signals point to it potentially driving a metric up, and seeing it fail anyway. You have to resign yourself to the process and tell yourself that, despite being right, your intuition is meaningless -- not a fun exercise as a human.<p>It turns out, in my experience, that the most successful creators are talented at both: trying lots of stuff and learning from their failures, but also having that sense of empathy, intuition, and taste to simply ""not be wrong"" more times than your average person. You can't A/B test your way to having an opinion. And you can't let an A/B test let you change your opinion on the things that matter.",1364723777

5468209,comment,5467874,5467874,9,0,gfodor,,,"The biggest problem with the lean startup stuff is it results in this ridiculous false dichotomy. There is no ""top down"" or ""bottom up"" thing. If you assume you are in one of these two buckets you already lose because you either are abandoning your creative thinking (bottom up) or abandoning listening to what customers are telling you (top down.) I realize the common retort to this is that all startups need to have top down thinking (""vision"") but the bottom line is the lean startup philosophy is at the very least poorly communicated because the large takeaway from all the writing on it is that startups should simply perform customer development and let the market dictate most of the actions they take and the products they build.<p>It's always a matter of deciding when to ship and how much time and resources to commit between data collection points (ie, releases.) This is a higher order function and changes as well in reaction to how you explore the solution space. Different domains have different constraints as to how fast you can iterate. Tesla, for example, is forced to iterate much more slowly than your average social gaming app can. Shipping too early, or shipping too late can result in wildly different outcomes. Drawing the line correctly is a matter of experience, taste, common sense, and luck.<p>Everyone knows you should try to minimize waste. Everyone knows you should prefer iteration over big releases. The question is always what constitutes ""viable"". A car that has three tires is not viable, and would be a market failure. The fourth tire takes a little more effort but makes the difference between success and failure. The problem is it takes some intuition to know people need all four tires to be willing to pay for a car. It also takes intuition to know that the three-tired car being a failure does not mean you should throw in the towel. I don't care how many metrics you measure, you can't use metrics to determine where an asymptote is going to appear because it's not going to be a part of any logical predictive model. Disruption is just that, disruption, and usually comes about due to a synergy of several things that were previously unknown to have magical properties when combined. You generally can't hill climb to find to these things, unless you set your step size (alpha) to a ""Goldilocks"" value: not too large and not too small.<p>I understand the appeal of creating a mental framework and slapping a label on it to help people think about and communicate ideas clearly. I think there are definitely some important ideas contained in the lean startup philosophy. But in the interest of creating a conceptual framework of absolutes like any other dogma the lean startup philosophy has large gaps in it's methodology that fail to explain for the large number of startups that launched products that many people would consider well beyond ""viable"", but were successful because their definition of ""viable"" happened to be the right one.",1364722529

5468202,comment,5467865,5467865,7,0,sargun,,,"So, the problem that I have with PostgreSQL isn't that it doesn't have every datastore under the sun, but rather the lack of automated distribution, and fault-tolerance.<p>This is not a hard thing to build though (continue reading please). I don't mean that it's an easy task, but that the semantics by which you may be able to build a fault-tolerant, distributed database on top of Postgresql are pretty straightforward.<p>1. Partitioning:\nSo, Postgresql has multiple notions of partitions. Ideally, this would be done at the database level in Postgres, but the idea is that instead of having your entire database fail at once, a transparent layer in which you SET PARTITION_KEY=X before querying would make this pretty straightforward. It would be nice if there was a semi-transparent proxy layer that this.<p>2. Replication / Fault-tolerance:\nPostgresql today has built-in synchronous master/slave replication. It would be nice if someone built a automated failover system on top this. Alternatively, it would be really interesting if someone had multiple postgresql instances, and then build a WAL log per partition, and performed 3PC between N replicas, and you could have a fully peer-to-peer postgres. I imagine these transactions would either need to be PL/SQL, or fully written-out, staged serializable SQL queries.<p>3. Co-processors:\nOne of the biggest benefits a distributed, fault-tolerant Postgresql setup would give you is the ability to collocate your application with the data. Instead of having to do read, modify, write, you can write complex business logic that can run on whichever Postgres partition's master node, and the data doesn't have to go over the network.<p>I feel by introducing some basic wrappers around postgres to support partitioned, master-slave topologies, and perhaps a slightly different query interface to support this transparently, PostgreSQL could effectively replace most modern NoSQL databases.",1364722340

5468184,comment,5467865,5468144,10,0,jacques_chester,,,"Basically, hierarchical and network databases were around before relational databases.<p>Both of them have the problem that they require a lot of up-front planning. When you build a hierarchy, you need to know how it's going to be used as that will determine the structure. Turning hierarchies into networks -- ie trees into graphs -- eases this a bit but you still have the problem of arranging things for easy navigation to nodes.<p>Say you build a project management system. Under a hierarchical system you might build it around the central concept of a Work Breakdown Structure. There are standard ways to produce these and they have a strictly hierarchical structure.<p>But here comes trouble, because now you've privileged the WBS over all other views into the model. So if for instance you're interested in an activity-based breakdown (percentage $ spent on documentation vs manufacturing etc), you're going to have to walk the entire WBS to work it out. Lucky you.<p>If you've ever queried an XML document in a way it wasn't originally set up for, this will seem familiar.<p>When relational databases introduced joins, lots of heads exploded. Pretty much anything that can be logically <i>derived</i> from relations can be expressed with joins, projections etc, without having to modify the database structure to accomodate those queries.<p>Now you can create a schema that relates WBS items to activities to cost accounts to whatever else. Now you can query them in any direction you like. Relational algebra means that the database can provably answer questions without having to waste time walking through a graph or visiting, potentially, ever node.<p>The historical systems to look for are IMS (the original hierarchical system) and CODASYL (a standard for network database programming).",1364721931

There is really more to it but from a technical perspective it is comparable to what I describe.<p>Anyway - I want tips on building this thing. Just general advice. I am working with a partner, who is handling the business side of things, all I have to worry about is the product. About my experience - I really don't have much, but I have read a lot about the development process. I have learned Java and C++ in school, but I have been programming in Python on the side and I am most comfortable with it. I'm currently reading a book on creating a Django app, which I hope to have done before the summer. Other areas - databases, taking a DB design course, have played around with Postgres, but have not implemented one in production. Front end - I know my HTML and CSS, I'm not familiar with Javascript but I figure if I know C++,Python, and Java I can pick it up quickly. As far as hosting platform I plan to use Heroku.<p>So if I have 2-3 months to build this, do you have any tips on how to succeed in general - what am I going against. I feel like I'm in over my head, but each of the concepts individually is very simple. I have only been programming for 2 years, and the first 6 months of that was extremely laid back intro, 1 year of CS seems to help tons, but as far as managing a huge project, I feel overwhelmed.

I didn't discuss the idea, but I am really attached to it, and I plan on  putting 110% effort into this things even if it means I am working on it non-stop. Even with this mentality however, I realize I am attacking a huge problem with no practical experience.<p>Learning as I go, the name of the game...",1364721916

5468174,comment,5467602,5467602,2,0,rbirkby,,,"Why does a site limit password lengths at all? Because at some point, some <i>other</i> limit will be exceeded. For example, HTTP POST size or even working-set size. But the question is specifically about low maximum password lengths. This boils down to hashing vs encrypting. Hashing (with or without salt) will produce a fixed-length output. The size of storage for this hash output is pre-determined. For example a varchar(20) for SHA1. For encryption, you have to take the plaintext <i>bytes</i> and produce a ciphertext of a maximum number of bytes to store. Now we have both a limit on the number of input characters, but also on which characters are permissible. Let's say a site allows the Euro symbol, passes that UTF8 byte stream through an encryption algorithm, base64 encodes the result and stores it in a varchar field. The trouble is that the Euro symbol is composed of a 4-byte multi-byte UTF8 sequence - F0 A4 AD A2. If a password system didn't take account of this, they could easily overflow the storage limit and potentially expose internal details via an error message to the user.<p>The simple answer is just to hash+salt and then to limit the input length to some large value to prevent blowing HTTP POST or process vm limits.",1364721542

But I did at one point go back to run photoshop 2 under emulation just to get a feel for its abilities. The amazing thing is that provided you understood the underlying mechanics of how effects like drop shadows or smoke halo's are done you could do them in photoshop 2 (and I assume version 1 as well). Instead of layers, which version 2 did not have, you would just put each ""layer"" in a separate image and then periodically combine them all in the right order into a target image through the filter effects. You could do reasonably modern effects on machines whose speeds were measured in mhz, not ghz.<p>I often think about how incredibly inefficient modern software is given that we've had roughly the same level of productivity software ability (with varying levels of usability) for a few decades now. I distinctly remember my NT4 system of the late 90's, and how it was roughly as productive as my current machine, and I wonder just how much cruft is inside modern operating systems and applications.",1364721266

Not everyone uses SSL, even though they should, and it's not always secure, and even with the use of SSL, it seems that there would be a potential length attack that could be employed to effectively guess a user's password length. So in all cases, IMO, it makes more sense to be receiving a fixed-length thing that is fairly insensitive to attack in itself. So perhaps a user has 2 salts associated with their account, per password: an auth salt and a storage salt. Then an auth looks something like this:<p><pre><code>    hash(saltFromServer + hash(password))\n</code></pre>\nAnd then the server would do<p><pre><code>    hash(user.salt + clientHash)\n</code></pre>\nI'm not sure, but this seems reasonable to me.",1364720790

Of course it can be done; how do banks holding billions of dollars of their customers funds manage to provide strict accountability for those?<p>Pretty much every prior technological breakthrough has made tyranny in the U.S. <i>more</i> likely, and the U.S. has managed to pull through in each case (though sometimes with roadbumps...).<p>And, if you&#x27;re really concerned about the rule of law you will do everything possible to avoid &quot;a 9/11 every year&quot;. When the state fails to protect the people, the people (armed by the 2nd Amendment) will take matters into their own hands, and it won&#x27;t be pretty for many innocents in America.<p>But again, if you have better ideas I&#x27;m sure the NSA is listening...",1372031936

Likely someone who saw their comment and saw that it was wrong.<p>The original commenter replied to my comment, &quot;Thanks for the reply, but it the down-vote was totally uncalled for.&quot; A few minutes later, before I could even respond, they deleted their comment  and then every one of my 100+ comments were down-voted. Most of my comments prior to that had zero down-votes at all.<p>That&#x27;s just my anecdote, and it&#x27;s still possible you were subjected to coordinated down-vote ring, but you said this was the result of an isolated incident of 1-2 small disagreements.

5930109,comment,5927843,5928149,15,0,Ixiaus,,,"Both Git and Rsync are <i>incompetent deployment tools</i> for many reasons I will not go into in a comment as there are quite a few articles expounding on the virtues of <i>not</i> using your VCS. There are also numerous reasons why rsync is inappropriate too (what if you push up a nasty bug and you have to revert? Op, better go revert to my tagged release then rsync again - this is ugly in comparison to <i>versioned releases</i> combined with proper use of the operating system&#x27;s dominant package manager where you can upgrade/downgrade an application based on its version...)<p>I generally see four stages in the devops maturation of a programmer:<p>1. I rsync my code using pre-built commands in Fabric when I&#x27;m ready to push.<p>2. I write code and have hooks on the server to pull the repo when I tag a release in my VCS.<p>3. I use my language&#x27;s package management system to build a source distribution that includes all of the necessary static assets, the web application, and any database migration code; I also use a sane versioning scheme to keep track of releases. When I want to push I use a build system that hooks into my continuous integration server and builds a distribution whenever the senior programmer tags a release. It is then made available to the production server in a deb or rpm repository where the senior programmer can then just run an update command (that updates with the new distribution and runs any necessary database migration or post-upgrade hook scripts).<p>4. You are so big that you&#x27;ve got a custom deployment system built on-top of BitTorrent (ala Facebook) or something similar.<p>It should be obvious where I&#x27;m at - I progressed from being an adherent to VCS deployment, to rsync only, to a proper source distribution release system.

Usually if I was tempted to submit at all, there is a specific angle I think might be interesting to HN, which may not be the same one in the title. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong sometimes, but I think it would at least make more sense to give me 5-10 words to explain what I think is interesting about a particular submission from an HN perspective, essentially, &quot;why are you submitting this?&quot;.<p>But since HN is hostile towards &quot;custom&quot; titles, the explanation of why you&#x27;re submitting has to be contained entirely in the original title text. That results in implicitly favoring articles from sources that start without an impedance mismatch, so to speak: places where the titles are already pre-targeted specifically to appeal to our demographic, maybe even to HN specifically, and often written with that SEO purpose in mind. That results in a fairly narrow range of sources, and at least partly explains the success of HN-targeted media like TechCrunch here.<p>The end result, as you note, is that a policy against sensationalizing titles actually ends up rewarding sources that sensationalize their titles.",1372031673

Its really quite simple: if youre interested in something, read up on it! Simple as that. Furthermore, if some tangent sparks your curiosity along the way, follow up on that as well. The sheer fact that youre even remotely interested in the thing youre reading about will ensure <i>some</i> level of efficient learning, so go and indulge.<p>Due to the way memory works (recognition in particular, or pattern matching memory), the brain has the capacity to operate like a fairly sophisticated machine learning algorithm, so keep feeding it data and dont worry so much about what youre gonna get out of it, cause your brain is gonna sort that all out later anyway.",1372029327

I know that the ATmega328 has an embedded comparator so I&#x27;m wondering how easy you think it would be to create a library for Arduino projects?<p>I currently have a few projects which are bound to servers so I can control them with web apps and this seems like a great way to liberate them from the network. Low-level analog signal processing is about where my knowledge comes to a screeching halt (hence using Arduinos in the first place) but I&#x27;d love to play around with any AVR code to try and implement this for high-level language hardware people.",1372028836

Google&#x27;s system is designed very differently from that model, but despite Google&#x27;s popularity and despite other services adopting a model similar to Google&#x27;s the law has not changed.

If you read the technical journals, there&#x27;s more stuff coming along. So, for example, right now there are corporations that are concerned about using computers with components made in China, because it&#x27;s technically possible to build into the hardware devices which will record what the computer is doing and send it to those bad guys. well, the articles don&#x27;t point out that if the Chinese can do it, we can do it better, and probably are, so it may end up in Obama&#x27;s database the next time you hit the computer.</i><p>--<p>I guess you can scoff about the notion that computer would (need to) have a &quot;recorder&quot;, or point out that Glass doesn&#x27;t record without the user&#x27;s say so, but still.. considering his age and that it&#x27;s not his field, that guy is paying more attention to things than many of those geeking out about them.

By that I mean you spend months, or sometimes years, not expecting your staff to make judgement calls for themselves, not communicating your intent, not building those relationships, and then there&#x27;s always some project where something needs to be done. At which point, the only way that you can do that project, given that you haven&#x27;t invested in those relationships, haven&#x27;t built those skills, is to tell everyone pretty much precisely what to do.<p>It&#x27;s a bad situation, and I think it&#x27;s fairly transparent to most people who&#x27;ve worked for any significant length of time that it&#x27;s not a good way to manage, but once someone is in that sort of situation there never seems to be a good time to move to a better model of management without having to let some commitments lapse. That&#x27;s a very hard sell to make to the rest of the organisation: Yes we&#x27;re going to make mistakes, and yes we&#x27;re going to miss some deadlines, (or need some forgiveness on deadline,) because we need to actually develop our staff.<p>The situation is, of course, exacerbated by the fact that even where that time is available; you&#x27;re working on a less intensive project; a lot of people want to think that what they&#x27;re doing at the moment works. They want to think well of themselves. And there&#x27;s a certain penalty that people, especially people with large egos, are going to pay in admitting that what they&#x27;ve been doing up until this point has certain flaws in it.",1450525990

Much of the article focuses on art whose only purpose seems to be so &quot;say something&quot;, to shock its viewers, to do something nobody else had ever thought of doing before. At which point in time did we lose the mother of all art - beauty? Aesthetics? Craftsmanship?<p>Now do not get me wrong, of course artists must engage in a dialogue with the society in which they live, and of course art is a great way of expressing political and social opinions. But when the fundamental purpose of art - the creation of something beautiful - is lost, all that remains is politics masquerading as art. And no wonder nobody wants to see that.<p>It is perfectly possible to produce art containing both: beautiful content and a strong message. Just take the Expressionist artists and poets of the Great War as an example. Wilfred Owen, Georg Heym, Otto Dix - they all produced incredibly strong anti-war art (poems and paintings) that still displayed a very high standard of artisan skill.

I think it&#x27;s a bit risky to conflate start ups and businesses that are solving problems with &#x27;giving back&#x27;. Let&#x27;s celebrate these startups for innovating, solving problems and being successful, but let&#x27;s not mix that up with &#x27;giving back&#x27;.<p>Giving back would be getting involved in social causes, solving problems for free with no expectation of any return, and in this context giving back to the open source community. Stripe is awesome but in this context it would be great to hear about how they are supporting open source projects they are built on than how they are solving problems in payment processing.<p>Open source funding is a bit of a mess at the moment. There is a huge lacuna on how to highlight startup companies (and thus encourage others) that are successfully built on open source contribute back. Companies that use open source should at least have a page listing the projects they are using and how they are giving back. There is no visibility or any initiative that tracks and encourages this positively. Without focus and organization nothing happens. Another important thing is giving back should be simple funding for open source projects and not hiring the developers or adding developers. That seems to be more about gaining influence than supporting the project for everyone.<p>The more worrying thing is a general lacuna of user representation in open source in an organized fashion, developer funding of popular and interesting projects that are not a part of the startup scene and just general funding. The inevitable result is open source will if it&#x27;s not already, be hijacked by corporate interests. Ultimately money makes its own agenda, and if users do not secure their interests others will.",1450523416

Here&#x27;s list of standard things that every application in the 90s had, that are frequently missing from the current UIs:<p>- Menu - Typically at the top of the screen or window, you can go there and find everything you can do with the application, at the consistent place; moreover, as you go over menu entries, an helpful explanation what does what will appear at the bottom of the screen.<p>- Toolbar - A place which has most commonly used tools. They are represented by icons, text, or both (and you can actually make a choice in settings). Typically, you can configure the toolbar to your heart&#x27;s content. Toolbars can also depend on the context.<p>- Context menu - Right clicking on some object will give you menu of things that you can do with that object. Again, explanation of what each of these actions does appears helpfully at the bottom of the screen.<p>- Tooltips - As you mouse over any UI element, it will helpfully explain you what it&#x27;s purpose.<p>- Buttons - Things that are clickable look visually differently than other things that are not. For example, they have different shading. Buttons may also give feedback that they are clickable when you mouse over them. Also, if you click thing that is clickable, it will give a feedback that it was clicked by changing the shading.<p>I think the big problem here is that UX/UI people want to be artists and so create art, not useful application for end users (which often means follow some standard!). So the end result is even more disastrous when programmers design UI (at least they are rational about it, in some sense), but the cause is the same - it&#x27;s putting your own ego (behold at my artistic creation!) in front of actual usability.",1450523372

That happens once: at module import time. After that, Python has cached the module in sys.modules and it doesn&#x27;t need to be evaluated again during the program&#x27;s runtime.<p>The module contains efficient Python classes that are Python bytecode just the same way &quot;compiled&quot; classes would be. But, thriftpy has Cython implementation of Thrift protocols and transports that compile down to C, not Python bytecode. Thus, the thriftpy impl&#x27;s are not only more dynamic and less cumbersome than the codegen alternative, but they are also faster.<p>In the Python community, we prefer to take other approaches to achieve execution speed.<p>Dynamically generating a Python module is not &quot;metaprogramming&quot;. It is not black magic. You can generate a module yourself simply by instantiating a Python module type. Hooking the import statement is an officially supported part of the language, and done by many libraries.<p>This may all seem very worrying to a C++ or Java programmer, but in the Python community we have been doing dynamism with execution  speed for about 10 years now, and we haven&#x27;t regretted any of the results!",1450523229

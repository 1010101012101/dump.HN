228309,comment,228233,228233,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I would strongly suggest that you read the biography of Erwin Schrodinger. Empirically, it seems to be quite possible to pick up mathematics and science at a later stage. But it doesn't happen too often. I cannot tell if this has to do with society's influence (there are many pressures keeping people from switching fields) or something to do with natural talent.<p>But I do think that success in science, mathematics, or really, anywhere, is much more a product of your habits, discipline, environment, and beliefs than is ordinarily given credit. I don't think 'nature', or 'very early nurture' is unimportant -- for example, it can play a very important role in the sorts of things you get interested in and the preferences, beliefs and skills you acquire. But <i>conditioned on having the same beliefs, habits, and discipline as masterful scientists, business people, or researchers</i>, if  you're talking about great contributions, I think the other dimensions of talent truly shrink into irrelevance.<p>Three terrific links: Michael Nielsen on Extreme Thinking. <a href=""http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?p=19"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?p=19</a><p>(Edit: Whoops!

That's a mistake.<p>The desktop is just a bunch of applications co-existing. Some programs have a document-centric interface because they deal with documents. Others have evolved an interface suited to the streams they deal with. MSN, IRC, RSS aggregators come to mind. I don't think there's more to it.<p>I agree that people are using streams more than before but I'm not sure of the implications of this fact.",1214458655

Thats only 3 years into a PhD, so really I wouldn't expect anyone (except super geniuses) to make many achievements by that age.  I'd say 30 between 27 and 30 seems like a pretty solid age, as you've reached a peak with your PhD and you're still young and inquisitive and hopefully humble.",1214458398

Can anybody suggest me a good site which regularly deals with hacking the hardware and prying open to understand more about the common electronic goods. 
At the end of it, it should give a reader a fair idea about whats running under the hood and 'possible' system architecture.I don't really need an iPhone-only or Mac-only site, I am looking for something more generic, like Wi-Fi routers,mobile phones and anything which is powered and has transistor in it :)",1214457818

My friends who went to the IMO were doubtlessly very smart, but they had something else: they had many years of training under their belts. I failed because I was an amateur, they succeeded because they trained like professional athletes.<p>To do Math, intelligence is required, but not sufficient. Tenacity, patience, stubborness, an obsession to figure things out, and the willingness to work very hard are also required.

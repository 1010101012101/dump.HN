For me that utterly destroys readability - in my mind, when I see a (), that function is being called there and then. The fact that you can invalidate that later in the line confuses me deeply - and it doesn&#x27;t really provide any benefits above an if statement anyway.<p>The rest of CoffeeScript is great though, don&#x27;t get me wrong.

10091827,comment,10091586,10091586,0,0,encoderer,,,"These two paragraphs lead me to believe that if the author had considered the rise of mandatory minimum sentences part of the war on drugs the headline of the paper might be different.<p><i>&quot;The five means by which the War on Drugs can drive up incarceration
rates (or punishment more generally) considered in Part II are (1) the direct
incarceration of drug offenders, (2) the re-incarceration of all types of offenders
due to drug-related parole violations, (3) the impact of drug incarcerations
on prison admissions instead of prison populations, (4) the extent to
which prior drug offenses trigger repeat-offender enhancement, even for
non-drug crimes, and (5) the effects of large-scale drug arrests and incarcerations
on neighborhood social cohesion, and the connections between social
stability and incarceration. &quot;</i><p><i>&quot;The connection here between the War on Drugs, longer criminal
records, and increased prosecutorial aggressiveness is fairly straightforward.
Increased drug enforcement results in defendants with longer felony records
and prosecutors may be more aggressive against such defendants. They may
be less willing to plead down felonies to misdemeanor, or to drop cases
altogether; to divert to an alternative program, or to drop more serious
charges. They may also be more willing to select charges that carry
mandatory minimums even when there are viable alternate charges that carry
no minimum. Such harshness could reflect increasingly punitive attitudes on
the part of prosecutors, perhaps in response to rising crime rates from the
1960s to the 1990s, or to other political and social factors. Or it could be that
prosecutors have maintained a relatively constant approach toward charging
repeat offenders, but the number of arrestees with long records has grown,
thanks in part to drug-related convictions. Note, too, that prosecutors need
not be more aggressive just toward those with more convictions, but perhaps
also toward those only with more prior arrests, even if some of those arrests
never resulted in convictions.&quot;</i>",1440079155

The browser can only use a limited number of connections to a host, so once these are in use the other requests queue behind waiting to a connection to become free.<p>2.

In this demo the server sends connection: close so forces the browser to open a new TCP connection and negotiate TLS for each of the tiles, so the congestion window won&#x27;t grow either.<p>Yes, HTTP/2 is faster, because it can send multiple requests at the same time to overcome latency, the server can fill the congestion window, and the window will grow.<p>But are our web pages build of tiny image tiles, or a greater variety of image and resources sizes?<p>EDIT: They&#x27;ve now enabled keep-alive which makes the HTTP/1.1 test much faster than it was",1440079138

The abstract (because I don&#x27;t have time to read the whole thing) doesn&#x27;t mention how much more <i>money</i> police departments have received, and how their funding rates are directly tied to how much &#x27;crime&#x27; they &#x27;fight&#x27;. The author lists what he sees as the ways drug war policy could impact prison population growth but the list is meager and does not integrate drug war policy into the broader social and political context.<p>The drug war was just a subset of a systematic antagonism by the state against certain population segments. The same communities that were ravaged by crime and police alike were pushed into calamity by social policies that lifted up <i>ahem</i> privileged segments of the population while leaving others in the dust with inadequate social and economic resources.<p>The only connection between conviction rates and the drug war the author considers are drug related convictions. That is, frankly, stupid. It is the increased presence of police brought about by the drug war by increased funding, bloating of federal agencies, and escalated enforcement practices that links the policy to the effect. If a cop is in the neighborhood because of the drug war and decides to rough someone up and arrest them for &#x27;quality of life&#x27; offenses or &#x27;resisting arrest&#x27;, that is an effect of policy, of which the drug war is a major component.<p>Normally I wouldn&#x27;t feel so skeptical of an expert&#x27;s findings on a highly complicated subject, but there&#x27;s also the fact that this publication claims it is nonintuitive and runs counter to the conventional thoughts of his peers. I think the lines of reasoning I tried to point out are well demonstrated in the first source he cites, Michelle Alexander&#x27;s fantastic book. I think the author can only achieve the results he can by drawing a small box around some policies and calling that the drug war when what other people call the drug war is far larger than that.<p>P.S. Another comment mentioned gang violence, which is strongly linked to inadequate social and economic resources <i>and</i> a large illegal drug trade.<p>P.P.S. When the police and prosecution get to decide who is a violent offender, you can&#x27;t use measurements of who is a violent offender in order to establish whether or not police policy is effective and just. Furthermore, why do people become violent offenders? The higher order effects of a policy that treats communities as disposable, unwanted, and antagonistic certainly feed into this.",1440079119

Since it caches the objects themselves it can also compare everything with `===` and/or `indexOf`.<p>The `Imba.static`-call marks an array as static which is a guarantee that the structure of the array won&#x27;t change. In this case Imba will not do the full diff-algorithm, but instead compare each item element-by-element.<p>And yes, once you&#x27;ve achieved the minimal amount of DOM changes needed (like React), the next step for performance is all of these little tweaks. Does it matter? It all depends. Imba is capable of rendering bigger applications than React when you use the &quot;render everything over again in the animation loop&quot;.<p>TLDR: The tags are more integrated into the language. The language is also designed around features that&#x27;s easy for the optimiser.",1440078838

But on the other hand compensation based purely on performance doesn&#x27;t work well either because it can feel unfair to workers particularly those can&#x27;t control the input for their output.<p>[ For example, I&#x27;ve worked with a radiology department where the hospital requires technologists to meet performance metrics based purely on scans/hour or they are sent home early before their shift is complete. This would seem to be more directly performance based, but the problem is that the rest of the hospital fails to do pre-scan screening questionaires correctly and doesn&#x27;t get patients to the scanners on time. It&#x27;s extremely demoralizing to the staff and more importantly it leaves very expensive hardware sitting around doing absolutely nothing. And the most talented staff actively avoid doing complex proceedures because they take longer. The &quot;bean counters&quot; somehow don&#x27;t care about the big picture--expensive hardware is left unused and patient care suffers--hardware purchases and staffing are managed by different administrators and overall things are just... not holistically integrated.

Split the founder&#x27;s equity 50-50 with identical terms.<p>Your investment, along with the rest of the F&F money should be written up as convertible notes. You will get that money back (plus interest) in the form of cash or stock (at a discounted conversion) when the company succeeds. Obviously, since he is not an investor, your co-founder won&#x27;t get any of that.<p>Finally, you are both employees. Since you are also both co-founders you typically don&#x27;t issue additional equity. However, if you both feel it is the fair thing to do then you could issue stock options to yourself, as the CEO, to make up for the salary cut. 5%, vesting over 4 years, would be typical for a CEO (with salary), but then even a fully-paid CTO would expect to get 2-3%. All things being equal, and assuming you don&#x27;t both take employee stock options (because it is just more paperwork) I would say that your 50% salary cut is worth a couple of percent in options, at most.<p>The big variable here isn&#x27;t your personal stake in the company, it is the success of that company. It is important that all parties feel that the split is equitable and they are full engaged in the process. Treating the guy who has chosen to join you at this early (and very risky) stage as anything less than a cofounder could make the difference between him making a superhuman effort to help the company succeed and treating it as just a job.

&quot;Taken together, these findings suggest that the effects of the War on Drugs are often relatively slight compared to other causes, and that they are certainly not as big as many often assert. In reality, a majority of prison growth has come from locking up violent offenders, and a large majority of those admitted to prison never serve time for a drug charge, at least not as their “primary” charge. These results pose a challenge to those who wish to aggressively scale back incarceration, since the current politics of reducing sanctions for drug offenders is less complicated than that for reducing punishment for violent or property offenders. Reforming drug statutes is easier, but doing so will likely not effect significant change in the overall incarceration rate.&quot; p.6",1440078430

Well, technically the instance variable `@bar` is just stored as a property with name `_bar` on the object.<p>- Variables must be declared with `var` and they correctly shadow previously defined variables.<p>- `do` provides a syntax sugar for the pattern &quot;function as the last argument&quot;<p>- Optional arguments work together with block parameters<p><pre><code>    def timeout(amount = 0, &cb)
      cb(amount)

Compiles to:<p><pre><code>    function timeout(amount,cb)
      if(cb==undefined && typeof amount == &#x27;function&#x27;) cb = amount,amount = 0;
      return cb(amount);
    };
</code></pre>
- `self` is a keyword which is a saner `this`, and instance variables are automatically looked up using `self`:<p><pre><code>    def end
      @client.on(&quot;end&quot;) do
         @server.end

TDD is not an option.<p>There are a few points we all agree which are:<p>- A week is a sprint in which each developer and designer achieve at least one goal by the end of Friday, unit tested and pushed to master branch in the end.<p>- Every member of the team at some point have to be given the chance to monitor the other without interfering with their work. This will help us track whether we are falling behind or some estimations that are done incorrectly or not. The one responsible for this task is also appointed to update our weekly change log and schedule board. A single entity/manager comparing the planned schedule with actual development for 6 months is therefore discouraged.<p>- Meetings should be short but also informative enough for the team to boot a single sprint.<p>- Stories should be prioritized and categorized by their importance and estimated development time.<p>- At least some sort initial plan (not a draft but a real one) is necessary to minimize future modifications to already developed parts. The requirements are not likely to change unless our technology stack suddenly meets a major update in its components.<p>We may have studied our lessons but a kind commenter may and should suggest any methodology if he/she finds it more suitable for our case.<p>Thank you!",1440076430

The ingest workflow is still somewhat manual, and there&#x27;s a lot of QA that has to go in to your metadata, but the tech side (transcoding, CDN delivery, etc) are commoditized -- especially if you&#x27;re a network that already owns the rights to your content.<p>This is all headed towards a world where the big ISPs run CDN nodes and all the channels buy delivery from them not because they force them to, but because the big ISPs can run their CDNs with a lower cost base (they already have the interconnects and disk space is cheap). The gatekeepers will still exist because they own a market control point -- you didn&#x27;t think it was going to be that easy, did you?<p>Apps are an issue, but they&#x27;re not that cumbersome to create, even cross-platform.

The NTM is just a condensed representation of a DTM, and in each case, the machine encodes an algorithm for whatever NP problem you are working. “Guessing correctly” has no bearing on NP, and it’s not a scary or impossible property that it works for people to believe implies P == NP is false. “Guessing correctly” ( otherwise known as branching ) is simply a property of the NTM occupying more than one subsequent state. As long as you construct an algorithm such that the NTM branches on its guesses in P time ( or equivalently the DTM is P size), then you have the P time algorithm. Pretending a valid reason for P == NP being “widely believed to be false”  because there would then exist “an NTM that supports guessing correctly as a primitive operation”, as if this should be somehow intuitively magical and impossible, is obfuscation, “guessing correctly” has nothing to do with NP and makes no problem harder or easier. “Guessing correctly” won’t make a shit algorithm good ( it’s not like an oracle in a quantum algorithm like Shor’s ), it’s just another way of describing a NTM. All you need to worry about is making that P time algorithm for some NP problem. Whether you want to implement that as a DTM or a NTM, is totally up to you. If it’s a P time algorithm it’s still a P time algorithm. I can make an EXP time algorithm in a NTM too if I like. “Guessing correctly” is not some magical speedup equivalent to P == NP. Too suggest that, or imply that, by suggesting that such a machine would somehow be magical is either the result of someone who doesn’t understand this, or someone who is choosing to obfuscate this. So either you don’t understand it, and you are pretending that you do. Or you do understand it and you are needlessly fabricating to try to argue for P !== NP, simply revealing how tenuous you fear the arguments are, and how deeply you lack any substantive ones that you must fabricate them. Your language is an attempt to obfuscate and incorrectly attempt to confuse people who don’t understand. If you really know this space, doing that is just balderdash. Well played.",1440076069

I afforded them every opportunity to be successful, but in several cases they were just too smart for me I guess so I had to set them free. This article sounds like a my many meetings with the latter.<p>As for advocating being a sheep. Some things are bigger than one person. Is the defensive end on a football team a sheep for following the play the QB/Offensive coordinator has chosen? He may not be put in the best place to make a tackle or a sack(very prestigious stats) because his role might be more subtle than that (containing the quarterback). This is what you do when you are part of a team. Why are you advocating going rogue?",1440075655

But the two most serious offers I&#x27;ve gotten were on 9 month and two year timescales (I turned down the short one &#x27;cause there was no way the buyer could have kept the company running after I left after 9 months.  It was an okay deal for me, but I&#x27;m not going to just burn the company.  I turned down the two year offer mostly because they weren&#x27;t offering enough to make up for, as you put it, the opportunity cost of me sticking around.  They wanted to own the company but wanted to keep paying me like I owned the company.)<p>But, it just seems to me that if they really are buying the company for the employees, and not for the company itself, they are going to want the employees for more than two years.   Yeah, they have to make it worth the employee&#x27;s time, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s worth the employer&#x27;s money if they only stick around for two years.<p>Oddly, both the offers for my company were presented to me as &quot;really, we mostly want to hire you&quot;  - but the terms of both offers were such that I would have been nuts to stick around after my earn-out was up, so it&#x27;s possible that they really just wanted the company and thought I&#x27;d be more receptive if they talked me up?

But if you aren&#x27;t directly holding those productive assets yourself but are trusting them to account held by someone else who promises to transfer them to you on demand or dispose of them at your direction, you probably want to do some consideration of their ability to keep them securely and execute the trust you are placing in them.",1393628127

7322093,comment,7319306,7321249,1,0,cwal37,,,"Again, the NIMH argument from authority. I truly do not understand the laser focus on clinical psychology and the DSM, which, I agree, has some major issues. Clinical medicine was not always as science-backed as it is today, but the field evolved over time as our tools and methodological became more sophisticated. I would argue that the broad field of psychology is far closer to its infancy than medicine, as it only branched off from philosophy late in the 19th century, and over time (with better tools and increased interaction with neuroscience and biology) the field will evolve to be closer to what you want. It might have a different name at that point. I think one aspect of psychology that leaves it open to attacks is that it borders a whole bunch of other fields, because it comes from an inherently fuzzy place of human consciousness and behavior.<p>Despite that, it still doesn&#x27;t make sense to discredit all other psychological research as non-science because you don&#x27;t believe in clinical psychology. By the way, if you want to trade federal research organizations, the NSF funds psychologists and psychological research.<p>I just can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t see the value in denigrating an entire field because I disagree with a piece of it. It&#x27;s counterproductive and only breeds animosity. If the argument goes &quot;hey, there are some parts to this research methodology that I don&#x27;t think are up to snuff, let&#x27;s focus on improving it.&quot; It&#x27;s a bit more effective than &quot;The DSM is worthless, clinical psychology is worthless, therefore all psychology is not a science.&quot;<p>And hey, going back to my first comment, sorry I didn&#x27;t know you were the blogger, but you didn&#x27;t have to be snarky, obviously I wasn&#x27;t accidentally mistaking a random website for an indictment from the head.",1393627932

The proposal seems to be to make it more like Java: you have to explicitly write &quot;implements Serializable&quot;, and it doesn&#x27;t by default.

7321940,comment,7318922,7318922,1,0,tokenadult,,,"Education policy is the issue that drew me to participate on Hacker News,[1] so I&#x27;ll jump in here too. I get the impression that mathattack, whose comments I enjoy reading, may have posted this article for disagreement. The Answer Sheet blog from which this guest post comes is basically a propaganda organ, and some of the guest posts from the same blog that were submitted to Hacker News in the past were exposed as hack jobs after discussion here.[2]<p>The obligatory disclosure here is to note that I am a classroom teacher by occupation. Over the years, I have been a teacher of Chinese to native speakers of English, a teacher of English to native speakers of Chinese (and other languages), and most recently a teacher of advanced elementary mathematics (&quot;prealgebra&quot; mathematics for third-, fourth-, and fifth-graders) for a nonprofit organization in my town. My HN user profile describes a bit more of my background.<p>Yep, classroom teaching is hard, no doubt about it. It has emotional rewards that some people value highly enough that it is a sought-after occupation, not a labor-shortage occupation, and that has the most to do with teacher compensation. Classroom teaching by teachers in private practice (like me) can also be poorly compensated (relative to the difficulty of doing the job well) because most clients have already paid for &quot;free&quot; lessons at the local public schools through their taxes, and will only pay out of pocket for a private lesson if it is truly superior in some way. &quot;In modern times [as contrasted with ancient times] the diligence of public teachers is more or less corrupted by the circumstances which render them more or less independent of their success and reputation in their particular professions. Their salaries, too, put the private teacher, who would pretend to come into competition with them, in the same state with a merchant who attempts to trade without a bounty in competition with those who trade with a considerable one. . . . The privileges of graduation, besides, are in many countries . . . obtained only by attending the lectures of the public teachers. . . . The endowment of schools and colleges have, in this manner, not only corrupted the diligence of public teachers, but have rendered it almost impossible to have any good private ones.&quot; -- Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Part 3, Article II (1776)<p>A couple of the comments posted here before I arrived in the thread mention the particular skills that a teacher needs to have to teach a class effectively. There is much interesting research on this coming from the charter school movement, with some of the best how-to research coming from the Teach Like a Champion[3] project. I love learning about new ways to be a more effective teacher. Besides actual teacher skills, another grave problem in United States school is extremely poor teaching materials[4] and I devote hundreds of hours to curriculum planning and seeking out the best available textbooks[5] for the subjects I teach.<p>A good teacher is worth a lot.[6] We would not go far wrong by saying that a good teacher is literally worth his or her weight in gold. But the tricky issue in school administration is distinguishing effective from ineffective teachers. To ensure that school leaders have incentives to find and reward the best teachers, we need to make sure that learners (or the adult guardians of minor learners) have the power to shop, the power to refuse the services of an ineffective teacher and to seek out the services of an effective teacher. Teachers will gain both more pay and more respect if learners gain power to shop.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4728123"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4728123</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3327847"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3327847</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://teachlikeachampion.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://teachlikeachampion.com/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://open.salon.com/blog/annie_keeghan/2012/02/17/afraid_of_your_childs_math_textbook_you_should_be"" rel=""nofollow"">http://open.salon.com/blog/annie_keeghan/2012/02/17/afraid_o...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Store/viewitem.php?item=prealgebra"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Store/viewitem.php?item=p...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/valuing-teachers-how-much-good-teacher-worth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/valuing-teachers-h...</a>",1393626076

In fact, &quot;severe&quot; deinstitutionalization has a longer history than severe national level gun control (state level gun control has a complicated history, most post-Reconstruction, around the turn of the century aimed at the new waves of non-Anglo-Saxon immigrants, or starting in the &#x27;70s), the latter starting in &#x27;68, and it&#x27;s been at net rolled back starting in &#x27;86, with a nationwide sweep of shall issue laws starting with Florida in &#x27;87, now with the Federal courts getting in the act soon to cover 90% of the population.<p>There have been a very few slight wins WRT to mental health counter-reform, but nothing at all like the RKBA reforms.  So while we continue to beat our head against a brick wall in the former, pushing the latter is merely reinforcing success, a sound tactical and strategic principle.<p>And one check against the public dangers of deinstitutionalization.  Not that most of the severely mentally ill are anything but a danger to themselves, but we can&#x27;t help but notice the solid correlations of severe mental illness and these shootings, and as noted elsewhere, for a long time, except for one, a correlation with &quot;Gun Free Zones&quot;.  Decreasing those may not help at net, but it will help those in areas where effective self-defense and its deterrent effects are allowed once again.  And that&#x27;s part of why it was the one Colorado gun-grabbing measure to fail last year.<p>As for your last point, we&#x27;ve been litigating that, going for age 18, and just lost a few days ago with the Supremes.  Obviously any line is arbitrary, but it&#x27;s a well and long established principle that &quot;children&quot; don&#x27;t have the full constitutional rights of adults, that their parents stand in for them there.

Maybe there are some laws that disproportionally effect minorities in California - I&#x27;m not an expert so I don&#x27;t know. However, I don&#x27;t think the term racism actually belongs. It seems to me that these are the effects are due to class, and (through the indirect effects of racism of old), blacks and other minorities are disproportionally poor. Because, especially in urban centers, that minorities make up most of the poor, I&#x27;m guessing, that one may mistakenly assume its due to racism, when its actually because of socioeconomic background.",1393624800

What about bestiality? Is it cruel and/or illegal because animals can't give consent? We eat animals much more often than we fuck them, yet we don't care that they can't consent to being killed. What about those ""bum fights"" videos, where homeless guys are paid to fight each other for our entertainment? Is that ""cruel"", or ""criminal assault"", or ""unlawful injury""?<p>I agree that children should be protected, and that animals shouldn't be hurt unnecessarily, but the crux of the matter is that there is a big difference between the act, and the recording of the act. The former is illegal, whereas the latter is just information, which in itself cannot harm, and which should thus not be illegal. The bottom line is that we've been made to believe that there is no difference. There used to be the Iron Curtain, whose purpose was to control people through political ideology. Then we got the Moral Curtain, behind which we still live, and which consists of child porn, bestiality, and all things ""obscene"". Now we are busy constructing the Copyright Curtain.",1328601294

The speed of the generated code lags behind gcc however, and it also lacks advanced optimizations such as pgo (profile guided optimization).<p>I look at it as a great alternative, but GCC remains my main compiler toolchain, partly because of the licence which ensures that all the enhancements done to it will be available to me as an end user but also because of the strong developer support it has from companies like Red Hat, IBM, Google, etc employing full-time developers working solely on GCC.",1328600522

It may be that Apple is just picking up some of these changes from FreeBSD and doing a little bit of housekeeping on their end.</i><p>First, a nit pick: Samba doesn't exist on current releases of Mac OS X. They've rewritten their SMB stack and it's under a dual BSD/ASPL license: <a href=""http://opensource.apple.com/source/smb/smb-552.3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.apple.com/source/smb/smb-552.3/</a><p>Second: bingo.<p>Why should Apple relinquish any control over their platform? If their eyes, removing GPL code reduces risk to their platform. There's going to be a constant fear that GPL code could ""contaminate"" non-GPL code. Why bother?<p>As you note, other BSD platforms are undertaking the same endeavor, so Apple's not alone and can support that effort. Which seems to be exactly what they're doing. They remove a perceived major risk to their products and continue helping the OSS community.<p>Finally, again as you note, there <i>are</i> better ways to keep rarely used software up to date. (Rarely used by the majority of Apple's user base.) I bet Apple desperately wants to get out of the business of shipping updates to command-line-only software, just as they've gotten out of the business of shipping Flash and Java updates. Why should they exert significant effort to try and update software that's rarely used on their platform and is better kept up to date via other mechanisms. Apple can provide the base, and anyone who needs OSS libraries, utilities or apps not provided by that base can use something like Homebrew and much more easily stay up to date. And if Apple stops vending that software, systems like Homebrew are far less likely to be broken by Apple OS updates. Win-win.",1328600115

3560869,comment,3560616,3560616,8,0,pilif,,,"This article gives a perfect example of why you would want to take advantage of the git index: the author was talking about different versions of coffee sometimes producing different output which lead to commits going back and forth between the two versions.<p>The author is right: this is annoying.<p>Now, the correct way to solve this would probably be to either not check in generated files, to leave the JS out of the repo, or, if that's not possible due to politics, then use the same version of coffee which I would highly recommend anyways because it gets rid of really bad WTFy issues if one version of the compiler has a bug which manifests itself in an application bug which will then only be seen if the last commit was done by the person with the broken compiler.<p>Anyways. Let's say you can't use the same compiler and you have to check in JS in addition to coffee (you are not trying to sneak in coffee by ONLY committing the JS, are you?)<p>Now we have the perfect oportunity to show off the git index:<p>Instead of committing the whole file, you would use add -p to only select the changes which are actual code changes and not changes in compiler output.<p>Then you would only commit those changes and then undo the unneeded stuff and test again, to ensure that you added the right lines to the index (commit --amend or rebase -i if not).<p>This will give you a much cleaner history, which will be a huge help when blaming or reviewing the code. No more annoying flip-flopping between compiler output styles. No more meaningless changes in a commit. All the changed lines in the diff are the lines that count. The lines you should look at when reviewing. No risk of missing the trees in the forest.<p>But, you might say, history rewriting is bad. I don't want to commit something I haven't tested.<p>Remember though: you haven't pushed yet. You haven't altered public history yet. Nobody knows about those commits yet. You have all the time for testing, patching and massaging commits. Only once you pushed, your changes (should) become set in stone. Only then, history gets written. Only then it can't be changed any more.<p>This is why I love rebase and I'm really glad I finally found a good real-world example to show why.",1328599925

Arrays have their own quirks but lets leave that aside for now.<p>Javascript lacks a well understood model of value identity[1]. Without a common model for value identity (i.e. more than reference identity) it becomes very difficult to implement custom data structures (e.g. a BTree for implement a true dictionary type) in a way that can easily (and naturally) be consumed by third parties. Lacking the ability to hook into the [] operator increases the awkwardness for anyone attempting to provide their own custom collections. I would suggest that the lack of good quality collections deployed widely in the javascript world underscores this problem. Contrast this with just about any other language you can think of and it is even more stark.<p>As an example, any good language probably has a Set datastructure these days. There are two ways to fake it: Degenerate map with the key being the real value and either some sentinal (such as true) or the key itself as the value, or (as is very common in javascript) an array and then doing indexOf.<p>Let that sink in: a common approach to sets in javascript (when you cant easily provide a string key for your object) is to do a linear search. Yuck.<p>For a wonderful counter point, have a look at how ClojureScript implements its own collection types, complete with value identity, indentity partitions and proper maps with object keys.<p>[1] Leaving aside all the unknowns most javascript programmers have about the `valueOf` method.",1328598801

3560800,comment,3560616,3560766,1,0,mattdw,,,"Particularly I'm thinking of the inescapable async-all-the-way down, which necessitates endless lambdas. In other languages it's possible to pick a point at which to invert control back to blocking-style; JS's single-thread model makes that impossible. So for instance all calls to the server API have to be callback style; if you have to make serial calls, you can't avoid nested callbacks.<p>I miss a set type, I miss solid iteration (although coffescript mitigates that), and immutable datatypes would be nice (I've got used to them in Clojure.) I miss a solid FP stdlib, although jQuery has map and filter, which goes a long way.<p>That's the ones I can immediately think of :).",1328598161

Each subsystem has a different idea of what a particular vehicle, weapon, or monster is. Two monsters might have the same physics properties but be rendered very differently. A Koopa and a Flying Koopa might look the same but behave differently. You can't start with classes for vehicles, weapons and monsters, and expect these classes to be used across all subsystems.<p>OOP is really a way to organize your code.

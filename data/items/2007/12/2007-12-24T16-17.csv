I've recently joined the Drupal community, but I really like Rails and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to the right person.<p>But, more importantly, when a member of the Drupal community inevitably urges you to use Drupal, they might also give you specific bits of invaluable advice like ""oh, that thing you're trying to do is just Drupal core, plus CCK, plus Views, plus Organic Groups, plus Imagefield/Imagecache. Oops, except that Imagecache assumes X and you want Y... you'll need a bit of custom code. This other thing you want to do is 100% custom code. And those fine-grained permissions you want will add an extra 100 queries per page for logged-in users -- they'll stop working as your paid userbase grows, so remember to hire a hacker to re-engineer them if your app is a success. And make sure to budget extra time for theming, because it's a bear.""",1198514936

Even if you're bringing in stable (in sense of Sharpe ratio) returns above the standard interest rates, you've already succeed.<p>I don't think it makes sense to play with your money unless you're very rich. Returns like 50% per year are quite unlikely in the longer run, yet very risky. Instead, consider starting a fund.",1198514370

92434,comment,92297,92297,0,0,theyoungceo,,,"This is as thorny a discussion as which language is the best one. And the ultimate answer is in the same vein: it depends, but the decision should always be driven by the customer. My company had revenue from month 2 and won a $100K business plan because of value we brought to customers. I still looked into raising money, but at the end of the day I reminded myself what I had always thought: I don't need to raise money, and changes that would make existing customers less pleased were on the way if I did. The company is growing fast and customers love it because we concentrated on them and ignored the startup hoopla when it conflicted with bringing value to customers. Ultimately, you should raise money if you think it is in your _customers'_ best interests.",1198513047
92433,comment,92341,92350,0,0,pfedor,,,"The kinetic energy goes to infinity as the speed of a particle approaches the speed of light, so there's no upper bound on the kinetic energy a particle can have in special relativity. The formula you possibly had in mind, mv^2/2, is valid only for v much less than c; for relativistic velocities the energy of a particle is equal to mc^2/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).<p>BTW, it's any kinetic energy that contributes to the temperature, not necessarily vibrational.",1198513023
92432,comment,92295,92365,0,0,henning,,,"I spent a few months trying to go from ""wow!"" numbers in papers to something that I thought could be used for risking my own hard-earned money, and I failed. I think it's tilting at windmills unless you have the resources of Goldman Sachs or someone like that behind you.<p>I know for a fact that some investment banks use these techniques; they just aren't using them to make a mechanical ""trade/no-trade"" decision.<p>What Joe Schmoe on the street reading these papers is interested in is the possibility of lucrative personal trading. The papers ostensibly claim to instead be examining market efficiency. Consequently reading these papers is kind of disappointing. But, the reason I submitted the paper was its unorthodox approach which differs from most of the other literature on applying evolutionary computation to mechanical trading.",1198512877
92431,comment,92295,92351,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"There are certainly plenty of firms that use AI-based investing techniques, but my understanding is that after being fashionable in the late 90s, they've fallen out of favor.  After a couple AI-based systems ""blew up,"" people realized that they're essentially opaque: you can't look at a neural network or a genetic algorithm and realize precisely what went wrong and fix it for next time.  There's nowhere to place the blame -- not even on the programmer, since he didn't directly create the trading rules.",1198512746

92429,comment,92291,92340,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Rails and Django, by contrast, are like precocious eleven-year-olds who are really good at gymnastics. <p>Django is the shy one. Rails is already wearing the skirt and carrying the pompoms, but the high school girls rebuff her by claiming that she's not tall enough.<p>(Rails is, of course, also being secretly employed by the Enterprise at this very moment. The metaphor kind of breaks down here, although Ender's Game does come to mind.)<p>Arc, of course, is entirely free from sin, but that's partly because she hasn't been born yet.",1198512456

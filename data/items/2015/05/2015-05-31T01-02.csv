9632668,comment,9632070,9632070,0,0,ajmurmann,,,"As a German who lives in the US since 8 years I am not surprised by this at all. By the time you finish university in Germany you are about 25 years old. They introduced the Bachelor/Master system, but at least when I studied, getting a Bachelor was more of a way to drop out gracefully. In addition there was a culture that expected you to stay at home until your child is at least 1 year old. Therefore there was very little support to take care of very young children.
For well educated couples this leaves an extremely small window in which you can have children. That doesn&#x27;t even account yet for people with other goals. Having a child means having time to try to bootstrap a startup parallel to your day job or doing extensive travel becomes extremely hard if not downright impossible.
An additional factor is that most Germans aren&#x27;t religious and even the ones who are are only on paper, but don&#x27;t actually care very much. Religion often times plays a large role in people&#x27;s desire to have children. That rarely happens in Germany.",1433036719

I also have some useful physical references I keep around and have physical (paper) files I need to keep track of for my job.

9632627,comment,9631592,9632561,0,0,MCRed,,,"I agree.<p>Libertarians are the original Gay Rights and Abortion Rights supporters, going back to the 1970s.  When Obama and Hillary were still anti gay-marriage (in 2013, before it became something they couldn&#x27;t ignore) and when Bill Clinton was signing the &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot; along with 3/4 of Congressional Democrats approval... and for two decades even prior to that, Libertarians were in favor of getting the government out of marriage.<p>Notice the Libertarian position is not the same as the mainstream &quot;Gay Marriage&quot; position.  Libertarians would legalize Poly marriage as well, while I&#x27;ve had Gay Marriage Advocates give me a list of reasons why  that shouldn&#x27;t be legal.<p>While some Libertarian candidates are personally against abortion, they would be laughed out of the movement if they advocated actually passing laws at the federal level to restrict it.   Hey, I&#x27;m even personally not a fan of it (though I paid for one once) but that is completely different from being willing to support their bans, and I wouldn&#x27;t support someone who wanted to ban them. (And yet I work for the Michael Badnarik campaign for a little while and he was &quot;anti-abortion&quot;)<p>Rand is going to have a tough time getting the republican nomination because that party hasn&#x27;t quite realized that it&#x27;s being to conservative and not responsible enough.<p>So I don&#x27;t mind that he&#x27;s not taking a stand on these things.<p>In fact, if we were in a climate where gay rights were being restricted (increased restrictions) or abortion were being fought (at the federal level) then I might be more worried about it.  But we are not.  W ran on a strong anti-abortion platform and nothing really happened during his term. He didn&#x27;t even try.  He knew it was a wedge issue, more than anything.  Only at the state level are Abortions at risk.<p>The real crime of our time is the out of control federal spying, adventurism and rights violations.<p>(this is not a rebuttal to hackinthebochs who said nothing I disagree with.)<p>EDIT:  My statements are historical fact and consistent with what&#x27;s known about libertarians:  They want the state out of these kinds of decisions.  Yet I&#x27;m downvoted.  Is it because I&#x27;m pointing out that the Democrats don&#x27;t really support gay rights?  Sorry, but it&#x27;s true.  When clinton signed DoMA with broad democrat support, I was out.  Sure the republicans were worse at that time, but I&#x27;m not going to compromise the idea that I don&#x27;t have a right to get married!<p>Even in the 1990s the Libertarians were the only party that was clearly pro gay rights and so I joined them.  The past 20 years have proven me right.  I take down votes (without comments or rebuttals) as merely an admission of the frustration at this truth.",1433035889

If they are not obviously dead, and do not have a DNR (or a &#x27;MOLST&#x27; in New York) then we&#x27;ll begin resuscitative efforts (using either ACLS[1] or PALS[2] guidelines, as appropriate). If the patient&#x27;s heart has any sort of electrical activity going on, we&#x27;ll generally spend 15-20 minutes trying to get it working properly again before calling a medical control physician to get permission to stop efforts and pronounce death.<p>If there is no electrical activity, then we&#x27;ll go through a couple &#x27;rounds&#x27; of ACLS, and it there is no response, we&#x27;ll just pronounce them. Very rarely do we transport an adult in cardiac arrest. CPR in a moving ambulance is very difficult to perform adequately, and in most cases we would just be bringing them to a facility that would be providing the same level of care that we are in the field (albeit with more hands available to help, but the tradeoff in time and poor quality CPR isn&#x27;t worth it).<p>The only exception to this are cases of traumatic arrests. If something is physically broken, no amount of CPR, drugs, or electricity are going to help, and their only hope is bright lights and cold steel (in a surgeon&#x27;s hand). Needless to say, the survival rates for out of hospital traumatic arrests are _vanishingly_ small.<p>Kids are different though... They&#x27;re easier to move, and easier to do CPR on. This means in most cases a pediatric arrest is a &#x27;scoop and run&#x27;, with any interventions being performed on the way in. This is in part because the resiliency of kids means they are a _little_ more tolerant of the time, and scene&#x27;s with dead kids tend to be extremely chaotic. It can be very difficult to concentrate with an (understandably) distraught parent yelling at you.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_cardiac_life_support"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_cardiac_life_support</a>

You have to be especially careful with ECDH that the points you receive from your counterparty are valid for the specific domain parameters you&#x27;re using, or else you can open yourself up to attacks. For this reason among others, cryptographers are converging on modern curves specifically designed to make it easier and safer to communicate points; Curve25519 is an &quot;early&quot; example of such a modern curve.<p>2. There&#x27;s an emerging consensus that ECDSA is unsafe, due to its dependency on a random nonce. That nonce is surprisingly hard to get right: it needs to be a full-width number, with that width defined by the curve parameters, for which all the bits are unpredictable. This is an even stricter requirement than a CBC IV or a CTR nonce. Single-digit bit biases in ECDSA nonces have been exploited to recover keys!<p>Very few people write their own elliptic curve core code; most modern systems either use Nacl, or pilfer Curve25519 from it.",1433034255

9632536,comment,9630875,9631737,0,0,alexqgb,,,"The thing is, <i>all</i> projections are wrong in some sense. That&#x27;s an unavoidable fact when transposing between flat surfaces where the angles in triangles always add up to 180 degrees, and triangles on curved surfaces where they don&#x27;t.<p>For instance, on a flat plane, given a straight line with two lines perpendicular (i.e. both at 90 degrees), those two lines will be parallel, and will not form a triangle with the base. But on a globe, two lines of longitude that are both at 90 degrees to the equatorial line will nevertheless converge at the pole. Depending on how far apart they are, the sum of the angles in a triangle on a curved surface can approach 360 degrees.<p>What this means is that it&#x27;s mathematically impossible to express triangles that work on a curved surface using triangles that work on a flat plane, because the latter is limited in ways that the former is not. In other words, in going from curved figures to flat ones, you&#x27;re going to have to distort something.<p>Your three choices are shape, distance, and direction. The more a projection preserves one, the more it&#x27;s going to have to distort another. Some projections try to strike a balance, others focus on one aspect at the expense of another.<p>The Mercator - which was originally designed for mariners - opted to preserve direction, and did so at the expense of shape, and, to a lesser degree, distance. So instead of a map where the distance between degrees varies at different points on the map, Mercator provides uniform measures of degree at every point. That means you can pick a location on the map, draw a straight line to your desired destination, note the angle formed by that line and magnetic and / or polar north, then set a course along that bearing with full confidence that you&#x27;ll arrive where you want to. As far as direction goes, Mercator is absolutely correct.<p>To visualize how this works, see this Wikipedia article showing Tissot&#x27;s Indicatrix on a sphere, then see this Esri writeup and note that on a Mercator, all the indices are perfect circles.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissot%27s_indicatrix"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissot%27s_indicatrix</a><p><a href=""http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2011/03/24/tissot-s-indicatrix-helps-illustrate-map-projection-distortion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2011/03/24/tissot-s-indica...</a>",1433034191

Two books come to my mind, PCL and ""Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation"", both for the Lisp beginner. I have read most of PCL and really liked it. I have just begun to read Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation and so far, am really liking it. Both are freely available on the net, so you have nothing to lose to try them out.<p>PCL - <a href=""http://gigamonkeys.com/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigamonkeys.com/book/</a>

253173,comment,252857,253148,0,0,demallien,,,"What else?  Well, Open, Eject, Get Information, Copy, Rename and Format are things which I'm guessing get done more often than running a disk check, and hence may be more suitable as options on a contextual menu.<p>The Mac almost certainly has a command line tool that is the equivalent of dmesg (I don't know for sure, as I've never had any need, as I just use the graphical interface provided in Disk Utilities, but I'd be astounded if this wasn't the case.  How is this done in BSD land?).<p>As for double clicking on the name in list, normally this launches the file (I've just checked on my Mac).  If your system decides that you are trying to rename the file instead, there are two possibilities - you've moved the mouse between clicks, or you're clicking too slow for whatever the setting for double clicks is in mouse preferences.<p><i>Even if I would get used to a mac I'd find zero benefits. I don't need easy to use, I need discoverability and verbosity. Give me every single option, and lots of text.</i><p>Well, you're a tiny tiny minority that Apple just doesn't care about.  Most people don't want verbosity, it annoys them.  They don't want lots of options that they don't understand, it stresses them out.  Outside of this majority are the power users, who can write scripts and apps to fill in any blanks on their system that they feel that Apple has missed.  And then there are people like you - people that know another system, and think that the Mac should act just like it.  That will never happen.  All of those options that you know from the Linux/Windows world confuse the majority of users.  Apple understands this, which is why their market share has been going through the roof in recent years.  If you miss them, you have two choices: become a Mac power user (if you know Linux, it won't be such a stretch, all your fave tools are there, from ipconfig and tcpdump, through to bash, perl, ruby and python), or accept that the Mac is not for you, and can never be for you without Apple comprising their main market.",1216728030

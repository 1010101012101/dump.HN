It's a real, respected university, with local offices in my city (Augusta, GA) if I choose to take a course or two that aren't offered online (physics, for instance).<p>They use Blackboard, which I loathe, but you're not going to get any other choice when it comes to distance learning.<p>Instructors are smart and fair and classes are reasonably sized so that you actually remember students names and personalities. The program is pretty well-rounded and they offer a multitude of electives to really focus in on a specific area of Computer Science (programming, in my case) while still earning enough credits to declare a minor (I've yet to decide on Math or Political Science).<p>On the business side of things (books, tuition assistance, advising, etc) it feels like a real university and not an online business (like University of Phoenix and American Military University, my two previous attempts, did).<p>Highly recommended - just wish they offered a Master's in CompSci (although I hear, it is beneficial to attend a different school for graduate courses).

One of our battery packs broke and a local was able to whip out a soldering iron and take the whole thing apart. He quickly identified the fuse as the offending part.

This all happened in under ten minutes in a dark hallway while he was sitting on the floor.<p>Sure, lots of people in lots of places are handy with various things but here in the states we rarely HAVE to fix things with no possibility of acquiring replacement parts, so I think sometimes it doesn't even occur to us to try.",1244562230

I think the only advice I could give a child going through this is to fight back and fight back hard even if that means more short term pain.

I considered myself unemployed after graduating from college because I was making my money by catering. Not exactly why I went to college...<p>So, with that interpretation; I was making barely enough to pay what little bills I had, I was able to do one of the things on Seth's list: I taught myself HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, and PHP. I built a couple simple DB driven websites for a friend's band. I then started messing around with the Asterisk PBX and foolishly tried to sell one to a company in the area and fortunately was saved a lot of pain and was hired by them instead.<p>The whole time I was told that I should be trying to get this type of job or the other, but I was dead-set on ending up in doing something technology-based. I think it was a good 18 months before that happened.<p>I don't think Seth is saying anything revolutionary. A piece of paper alone doesn't make your a good hire. If they aren't biting with what you have, then work on making it into what they want to see. Over simply; stop wallowing, get over any feelings of entitlement that may be lingering, and do something productive.",1244560385

I like working with my hands too. I've renovated my house, built a chicken coop and shed. I've built a stone patio and change the oil in my car. These things can be difficult and time consuming but very rewarding, and you certainly develop a respect for the skills it takes to do these things professionally.<p>However, I would never choose to do these things as a full-time career. I like being a ""knowledge worker"" and manager and all of the challenges that it entails. I also enjoy the freedom it gives me to choose to do manual labor when I want to. I'm friends with a house painter, general contractor and two fisherman. The painter and fishermen have VERY demanding jobs and worry (now that they are in their 40's) about how long they can continue.<p>These types of articles and books surface from time to time and they always seem to romanticize blue collar work. In my opinion blue collar work makes a great hobby but in real life it is hard and physically demanding work. I'll happily keep my desk-jockey status.",1244559919
649197,comment,648942,649128,0,0,gruseom,,,"I agree, but this is a harder problem than it sounds. What's satisfying to the musician and what's satisfying to the listener are often different. Many musicians are interested in things that are hard or unusual to play. But most great music is simple or at least has an emotionally accessible, simple core. To have both an intellectual/technical engagement with the instrument and an emotional engagement with the listener is not always easy. The intellectual side is seductive, especially for the hacker type of musician.<p>The greatness of punk rock was that it swept aside (or more precisely pissed all over) bombastic competence in favor of immediate vitality, which is much closer to what music is all about. But something like that inevitably becomes a formula and then you have the worst of both worlds: stupid and boring.",1244559892

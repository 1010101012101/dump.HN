Achieving those for e.g. laundry might not make the world a much better place, but it is still quite an achievement.<p>The other side of this &quot;wholly unnecessary&quot;-business, is that with rising standards of living, necessities are already fairly well provided for, so it is quite obvious that any future desired consumer good will be mostly in the unnecessary category. A funny read about these types of things is &quot;The Idea of Luxury: A Conceptual and Historical Investigation&quot; by Christopher J. Berry, where he describes 18th century philosophers discussing what is luxury (i.e unnecessary) and what is necessity. They end up with a paradoxical example regardning the scant clothing of &quot;savages&quot; (that is non-europeans in warmer climates), and cannot resolve the fact that despite this clothing being really primitive by their standards, it is not strictly necessary for survival, or even most other activities, so they must conclude that even that is just luxury.",1401436290

In this regard, the comparison is unfair. On the backside, the frequentists&#x27; sequential methods for more than one dimension seem to be rather complicated (for one dimension and binomial distribution, check out the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT)).<p>2. Finding a good prior is really really hard. Choosing a weak prior may lead to jumping to wrong conclusions. I found it useful to \na) choose a uninformative prior \nb) do not perform a statistical analysis until 1-2 weeks of data are in (to be sure that all special-day-effects like weekends are caught) ... which could be seen as a prior with weight of the same interval ;)\nc) using a simple old-fashioned permutation test to control the alpha error and prevent jumping to conclusions<p>While this approach has turned out to be too conservative in the binomial case, it becomes extremely important when dealing with revenue.

7820642,comment,7809174,7809682,1,0,noselasd,,,"&quot;wait for the service to be active&quot; Well, how do you do that ? The service needs a way to to say &quot;I&#x27;m done initializing and are now up and ready&quot;. That&#x27;s not the way a lot of daemons are written today. They normally fork twice (or calls the daemon() function) and then starts initialization.<p>Looking through all the current init scripts, almost none of them do that. They launch the service executable, and report success it that succeeded. The service then often fork to place itself in the background, starts initialization, and might fail at that point without the init system noticing it.<p>The &quot;forking&quot; option of systemd will do the same, which is reasonable since a lot of existing services already works that way.<p>The apache init script on my system is one of the exceptions though, it doesn&#x27;t directly launch apache, instead it starts apachectl, a program specifically written to start and interact with apache. That program communicates with apache, and therefore knows when it&#x27;s started, whether it failed because httpd.conf had an error and so on.<p>That&#x27;s not a general approach - unless you want to have each service accompanied by a program capable of doing IPC with the service for use with e.g. startup and shutdown. That&#x27;d make services portable among init systems and operating systems, so if you need that, it&#x27;s a reasonable approach.<p>For systemd you&#x27;d can do the same, run apachectl to start apache.",1401434597

Why can't you just moderate your comments and delete anything that this person posts?  You'll have a hard time tracking someone like that down.<p>If you get any threats, then I do suggest showing it to the police.  You may be able to get microsoft or google involved to cancel the account, but the services are free and they would probably just sign up again.  Also, because of the privacy policies in place, they may not be willing to help you at all.",1205099888

Peripheral makers not updating drivers, though they had an unusually long period of time to do so. OEMs mislabeling laptops as Vista ready/capable/whatever when they clearly aren't.<p>How could MS have handled this better? Make drivers for every known product themselves? Micromanage Vista Ready certifications(that one seems plausible at least)?",1205099675
132724,comment,132371,132685,0,0,Husafan,,,"Point taken. :) Let me ever so humbly posit, however, that this is the exact attitude that separates software developers from software engineers.<p>If you want to develop software without strict practices, that's just dandy, and you don't have to refer to yourself as a software engineer.  It does not follow that software engineering is a joke: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=132640"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=132640</a>.<p>On the other hand, if you do want to be a software engineer, these practices can be applied to all projects, no matter how small or high-level.

The founder took the prototype I built for him in my spare time and had terminated my employment two weeks before my ""generous options"" granted, explaining to me that it was hard to get funded because there were ""too many cofounders"" and VCs ""didn't feel comfortable"".

You'll just be in a looping of solving problem that doesn't exist. Because of youtube, the video copyright law will change. We start startups to make the world a better place: change laws, change the way we do things; not staying on the same corrupted path we're on. When goog started, people were concern on how goog could make sure not to index webpages without webmasters permission. That was an issue; but goog didn't think it was important. Now webmasters pays $1000 of dollars for their link to be listed on goog first page search. Sometimes an issue appears because the mass population hasn't adopt to it yet. I truly believe ones can break any law or disregard a problem as long as he/she has a purpose reason. If you don't agree, ask the US commander-in-chief.",1205098876

132712,comment,132495,132495,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I don't know the nitty-gritty details of what went wrong in the development of Vista, but I can't shake the feeling that they simply waited too long between OS version releases. I think they could have avoided a lot of trouble had they realised, say, 2-3 years after XP that Vista was in trouble and ported some of the new stuff over to a less ambitious upgrade to XP/2003. The remaining planned changes could then have been done in the following version.<p>Previously, their product cycle was around 2-3 years, except for 2000->XP (1 year), and NT 4.0->2000 (4 years). They took almost 6 years to upgrade their desktop OS with Vista, and made changes almost at every level. People hate change. That includes both end-users and developers of end-user software and hardware drivers.<p>I don't think you can just force large-scale changes to something as fundamental as an OS, you have to spoon-feed it to the users. Breakages in the layers on top of it won't be too catastrophic, are fixed more quickly and thus pissing users off. (I didn't really follow anything Mac-related during the time of the MacOS 9->10 switchover, so I don't know how they got away with that)<p>Note: I primarily use Linux; I only have Windows (XP) installed for playing games and testing, and I'm putting off the Vista upgrade for later. In contrast, I usually upgrade my Linux system shortly after a new version of my distro (OpenSUSE) is out, which is typically every 6-8 months: the changes between versions aren't massive and the inconvenience caused tends to be minor.",1205098309

If you can't do that, and want to wait until you have a prototype then look to hire someone on a contract. If it works out then you can make them an offer to join full time.<p>I think you need to demonstrate what you bring to the table other than an idea. When you do that you will gain the respect of the hacker and you might be able to get a deal going. It might even be something like, when you raise some cash I'll come join you.<p>What are you going to do for the first 6 months, to raise the value of the business?

That can't be right.<p>From your link: <i>The genetic fallacy is a fallacy of irrelevance where a conclusion is suggested based solely on something or someone's origin rather than its current meaning or context.</i><p>Notice how it says <i>solely</i>? There's no solely about this. To consider a root is not to ignore current meaning; one can do both. That's, uh, what dictionaries do.<p><a href=""http://www.fallacyfiles.org/afonedis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fallacyfiles.org/afonedis.html</a><p>There's another point. The genetic fallacy refers to historical origin. The root of a word is certainly that, but it's also a piece (the main piece, in fact) of the word <i>as it is now</i>. If your point were correct, then a botanist examining the roots of a plant would also be committing the genetic fallacy. Happily for botanists and etymologists, the genetic fallacy applies to one sense of ""root"" but not the other.<p><a href=""http://www.fallacyfiles.org/ambiguit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fallacyfiles.org/ambiguit.html</a>",1205097143

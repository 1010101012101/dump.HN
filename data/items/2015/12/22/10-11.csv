10776971,comment,10775440,10775728,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Expendable rocket design is a local maxima which reduces fitness for reuse. This is because the typical, and traditional, optimizations all work against reuse. Reducing the number of engines on the first stage lowers cost and increases reliability and performance. And makes VTVL operations nearly impossible without adding additional engines (ballooning complexity, increasing stage cost, and reducing performance in an already extremely performance constrained system). Additionally, the traditional method for incrementally improving overall launch vehicle performance is to change the upper stage. By switching to a higher performance LOX/LH2 stage you can increase payload without redesigning the first stage, and without increasing gross liftoff weight. Even with the Falcon 9 they changed the second stage to improve performance, but they avoided the pitfall of making it much more advanced. On paper advanced upper stages seems like smart thing to do. You concentrate your engineering efforts on one of the smaller pieces of the rocket, and you improve performance without necessitating a full redesign. But this results in a vehicle with most of the cost in the upper stage.<p>This development trajectory leads to a capable launcher, but one that is wholly unsuited for reuse. Reusing the first stage is now extraordinarily difficult, extraordinarily costly, and has little advantage (since most of the cost is in the upper stage anyway). You see the effects of this design pattern in most expendable launchers. Both the Delta IV and Atlas V boosters use a single engine in the first stage, and both use an RL-10 LOX/LH2 engine for the 2nd stage, an extremely expensive engine on its own, let alone when it&#x27;s integrated into a high-tech stage (such as Lockheed-Martin&#x27;s legendary Centaur line). The Ariane 5 has gone through 5 different generations of upper stage advancements, and it too has only one engine on its first stage. India&#x27;s GSLV uses a solid first stage with hypergolic boosters and second stage and a LOX/LH2 3rd stage.<p>Meanwhile, there hasn&#x27;t been much pressure on rocket designers to be hard headedly pragmatic. Often times winning government contracts or even private investment meant convincing people of your beyond state-of-the-art designs that would leap frog the competition, rather than rely on common sense engineering and iterative advancements. That&#x27;s how we got the Shuttle (which was supposed to be about 2 orders of magnitude cheaper to operate than it turned out to be), the X-33/VentureStar program, the NASP/X-30 program, Rotary Rocket, Pioneer Rocketplane, and all the other programs and startups that were cancelled when they ran out of money, ran into engineering problems, or both.<p>The sensible thing is to try reusing some of the rocket and make the most of that from a cost perspective. Something that saw a bit of attention with the old DC-X program over two decades ago. One problem with that program was that it envisioned a new launcher that was mostly an SSTO, and aimed at building up from small scale rather than building toward reuse from full orbital scale.<p>The genius of Musk and SpaceX has several facets:<p>1) Begin with expendable, but design with reuse in mind (high throttle ability in the first stage, most of the costs in the first stage), and work towards there iteratively. That way you get experience in a lot of the most important bits of the business: building orbital rockets, building rocket engines, building spacecraft, launching rockets. And you get cold, hard cash flowing into the company from launches. Cash that keeps the company in business, and finances further innovations.<p>2) Build reuse not as a different vehicle but as a &quot;feature flag&quot; on a common design. The difference between a reusable launcher and an expendable launcher for SpaceX is a <i>mode</i> selection, not an architectural difference. This means that you get operational testing of the vast majority of your flight hardware for your vehicle with every single expendable launch. This is a well-known risk mitigation strategy in software and other industries, and here it works marvelously. Prior to today&#x27;s launch SpaceX had 14 previous launches of substantially the same hardware (counting only the v1.1 version).<p>3) Opportunistically use the first stage after stage sep. for experimenting with boost back and landing. From the very first v1.1 launch SpaceX has been aggressive at testing aspects of the landing and reuse flight mode, equipping stages with landing gear in many cases. This is a fantastic cost saving method as it takes what would be trash and transforms it into test vehicles being operated in typical flight profiles. This takes advantage of hundreds of millions of dollars of flight hardware to conduct an R&D test program on the cheap.<p>Combine all of that together and you end up with a way to get from A (expendable rockets) to B (reusable rockets) without having to take on a ton of risk, without having to spend insane amounts of money, without having to design and operationally prove a brand new reusable vehicle design, and to build a revenue earning and self-sustaining business before being able to finish reusable vehicle development. It took a significant amount of foresight and savvy to be able to see that route and to execute on it.<p>And yes, knowing what we know now it would have been easy to do this sort of stuff in the past, more so if we wanted to just throw money at it. But it wasn&#x27;t obvious until being proven.",1450781806

Here are some of the pain points we hear a lot.<p>3d printing is expensive<p>- You can have something 3d printed the size of a tennis ball for 5-10 euro&#x27;s at 3dhubs.com. You save 10 euro on shipment compared to shapeways and you&#x27;ll have your object in 2 days rather tan 2 weeks.<p>It&#x27;s complicated<p>- Well the first thing I 3d printed wasn&#x27;t something I designed myself but was something I found online. Chances are that somebody already created the thing you were looking for.\n- Even after 200 models I still curse when I try a new (supposed super easy) modelling tool.  But hey they are free now and you can find lots of video tutorials. Like me you&#x27;re probably a fast learner. It&#x27;s more taking the first step to spend an evening on it.<p>Desktop 3d printers suck<p>- Until 2 weeks even I had that impression, but since I bought my 3rd: a 2,000 dollar Zortrax M200 I changed my mind. I&#x27;m all into open-source but this thing is really plug and play and take away a lot of the hazzle I had before. Even my wife can start a print now. So far it&#x27;s been printing for 50 hours and 25 model with zero print failures. I&#x27;t no longer kickstarterish.<p>There are better alternatives<p>- Yes. But 3d printing it&#x27;s just a good fit for me. I&#x27;m a software engineer, I just like to work digital and I&#x27;m very lazy. Often I can just download it and print.<p>The 3d printing hype is over<p>- Yes, but 500k-1M free 3d models on thingiverse.com is REAL.  My 2000 Zortrax printer really works well and is what I was hoping 3d printing would be like.",1450781055

10776916,comment,10771031,10776014,0,0,lmm,,,"> I haven&#x27;t thought too much about it, but I believe that if you structure effects as continuations, then they are monadic by construction (though I may well be wrong) because the continuations themselves are monadic. But I got interested in continuations because I don&#x27;t like Haskell&#x27;s purity, and I wondered if there is an imperative construct with the same expressive power as the PFP monad, and it turns out that not only that there is one, but that it composes much better than monads.<p>I don&#x27;t see it as imperative - if anything passing continuations around is more functional. They were originally a scheme thing, no?<p>How does the stack aspect work? It&#x27;s a continuation style so you never return, so if you keep the stack frames around it&#x27;ll overflow very quickly, right? The usual solution to that is tail call elimination, but then you don&#x27;t have even the immediate stack trace. Are you doing some kind of dynamic &quot;keep the last x stack frames&quot;? (I can imagine that being useful for a trampolined monad style too).<p>I think that&#x27;s the really interesting part. As you say the styles are equivalent (even clearer when one&#x27;s using something like scalaz-stream), so it&#x27;s a question of which is easier to read/understand. I do think the monadic style as implemented in scala has a big runtime-inspectability problem (one idea I keep toying with is a free monad style where you represent every step with a named object or class, purely so that debuggers handle them correctly). I find call/cc style incomprehensible at the code-reading level - I&#x27;d rather have the control flow captured in a value I can inspect in a debugger than as what are effectively gotos in the code text. Maybe if you&#x27;re more used to macro-based programming then it makes more sense.",1450780811

The only reason &quot;systemd&quot; does this now is because they replaced consolekit (yay) and absorbed udev (boo). You either love or hate the ambiguity of terms like &quot;systemd&quot; and &quot;modular&quot;, and the way it has been exploited to full extent during the systemd takeover.<p>&quot;Modern usage scenario&#x27;s&quot; should still include reliable boot and predictable behaviour. Systemd seems to have been developed under an assumption of infallibility, which makes recovering from a failing boot much harder. And a failing boot is much more common under systemd, because it has been designed to fail hard instead of fail safe.<p>I&#x27;m running Debian on seven systems, and only one of those is running systemd. The others simply won&#x27;t boot with it, or are headless and I won&#x27;t risk bricking them (see fail hard above). The one system that I do run systemd on, I&#x27;ve had to disable the lvm and luks generators because they would fail hard, and I&#x27;ve had to compile it from git because Debian&#x27;s shipped versions of networkd and resolved are broken.<p>I agree with the article that systemd adoption was premature. Throughout the discussion, I got the impression that the decision was forced because of primarily the interests of desktop and service developers, with only a minor nod to system maintenance.<p>imnsho, &quot;systemd&quot; the project was not ready for inclusion. Systemd as PID1 may have been ready, but systemd the project does not allow systemd to run as PID1 without the rest of the project.",1450779809

How many of them do you think are likely to have achieved the same success SpaceX has?<p>To put it another way, if Elon Musk hadn&#x27;t founded SpaceX in 2002, how many of the engineers currently working there would right now be celebrating working at a company having  successfully recovered a first stage from an orbital rocket?<p>Let&#x27;s try looking at it from a third angle. Lets suppose a random employee other then Elon Musk had been unable to join the company during it&#x27;s history and had to be replaced with another job candidate. What are the chances such a substitution would have prevented SpaceX from achieving a stage recovery?<p>Finally, I&#x27;ll address your proposed scenario directly. How likely is it that having the wrong mail man in that position would lead to the failure of the company? In contrast, what are the chances that having the wrong CEO might lead to the failure of the company? I can imagine Elon Musk might make a pretty decent mailman. But if we took the best mailman in the country and put him or her in charge of SpaceX, do you think that would be likely to have a positive or negative effect on the prospects of the company?",1450778643

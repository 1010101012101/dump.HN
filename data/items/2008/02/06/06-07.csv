110174,comment,110019,110130,0,0,curi,,,"FYI I didn't downmod you.<p>Anyway, it seems a bit like linking to Revenge of the Nerds (pretend it was modern) and saying: look, people like nerds more now. That kind of popular culture event doesn't seem like hacker news to me. On a similar note, I think the ""dating advice for introverts"" links we sometimes get are off topic too. Even though they, too, reveal something about how the public sees hackers.",1202280841

110160,comment,108723,108723,0,0,iratsu,,,"One thing I would recommend looking at is Category theory. MarkCC has several blog posts about category theory at the Good Math Bad Math blog (<a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/goodmath/category_theory/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/goodmath/category_theory/</a>, in general i would also recommend looking at MarkCC's other blog posts as a source of math inspiration).<p>Wikipedia also has a nice article about category theory. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory</a>), and I will also recommend 2 books on the subject:<p>First is, of course, Category Theory for the Working Mathematician by Saunders Maclane. It is an excellent book,  but I must also warn that it is not an easy book and probably requires a fair bit on mathematical maturity.<p>Second is Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists by Benjamin Pierce. It is much more of an introductory book and provides many examples in Computer Science which are useful to those doing theoretical CS.",1202278196

If they are poor predictors they will lose money on average and if they are good they will gain money. After many events the good predictors will tend to prevail over the poor ones because they have more money to bet and they'll be more eager to bet... Oh screw it I give up... some people just don't get odds or markets.",1202278186

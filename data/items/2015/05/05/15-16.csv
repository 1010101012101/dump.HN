Ever.<p>If you look at the whole grammar system and the compiler design of Perl 6 you will see this is precisely what they have done.<p>>>Guido said this won&#x27;t happen again.<p>Not that easy. To compete with newer and powerful tools you have to add features that you need. You can&#x27;t do that without bloat or breaking things. Again look up the Perl 6 compiler design.<p>>>Migrating a relatively complex project from 5 to 6 is extraordinarily hard.<p>This is like saying migrating from C to Java is hard. Of course it is, because 5 and 6 are two different languages.<p>>>There is no incentive for migration.<p>There never ever was and should never be, Perl 6 is for new projects. Perl 5 and Perl 6 are two different languages which will have their own evolution path.<p>>>But Perl 6 while being a nice language, doesn&#x27;t seem to have any killer feature compared to mainstream languages.<p>Seriously?? Have you even looked at Perl 6.",1430841595

Don&#x27;t tell, don&#x27;t lecture, just ask.<p>Listening uncritically amounts to accepting the other person&#x27;s worldview uncritically; it&#x27;s a very bad practice that will lead to believing a lot of nonsense (e.g. it makes it easy to fall victim to a religious cult). If an idea or ideology is sound, it should be able to explain itself in plain language to an actively skeptical listener.<p>> Have you heard of the Bechdel Test? It&#x27;s a simple feminist film critique. In a movie, is there at least one scene where two women who have actual names and roles have a conversation that is not about men and what the men in the movie are doing?<p>I&#x27;ve never understood what this is supposed to indicate. I tend to watch more animé than western cinema, and you&#x27;ll often see cases that would fail the reverse Bechdel Test - i.e. a movie or series that never has two men having a conversation that&#x27;s not about women.

That does seem like lower-than-expected equity for a senior employee at a small start-up that&#x27;s pre-series-A.<p>2.  But on some level, I don&#x27;t think that should be the controlling factor.  I&#x27;m assuming here that this is a pretty run-of-the-mill seemingly doing-well pre-series-A startup.  That is, it&#x27;ll be at least five years, and probably more like ten, before it monetizes, and the chance of it monetizing is sub-10%.  And your options would vest over the course of 4 years with a 1 year cliff.<p>3.  So that said, if you&#x27;re going to be there 4 years, and the company is going to do well enough over those 4 years for us to care what your equity is, then I would assume that 4 years from now, you&#x27;ll be a critical member of the leadership team.  The company will have had to grow a lot, you&#x27;re senior already, so...  right?  There&#x27;s plenty of chance to, in that case, have your equity position &quot;right-size&quot; with the company.  To, in other words, re-grant stock based on whatever inflation happens and based on how you work out as a member of the inner team of the company.<p>4.  And given how far off any equity payout is, and how uncertain it is, I&#x27;d think that your decision to go with the company should be based on salary, what you expect the salary to do in the next year or two, and whether you believe that you can become a member of the leadership team of the company and whether you would enjoy all of that.<p>5.  If, on the other hand, this company has some kind of special sauce that means that equity payout is more likely or more near-term, then, well, maybe that justifies the lower equity award.",1430840799

If the low level error hadn&#x27;t been handled locally,  a more user friendly level of the system could have made a more user friendly level presentation of the information regarding the failure.<p>Because the kernel code cowboys ignored the UX city slickers, the system failure is in a sense, double. Not only does it stop letting the user type words into boxes, but then it also fails by presenting the user with a bunch of useless gobbledy-gook. It would have been better if they had asked the people working on the higher level abstractions, &quot;Should we handle <this type> of error and if so how?&quot; Or with wonderfully non-technical ambiguity, asking, &quot;What should we do when we crash?&quot;<p>If the error is handled locally, there&#x27;s no chance that a higher level can handle it more gracefully.

They have the power to set the distance and to prepare themselves if they&#x27;re going to close the distance!

Everyone is built differently, so there is no guarantee of health on either side. Eventually, both forms of work will catch up with you. It&#x27;s just a matter of which one you can personally handle better. ie. carpal tunnel vs slipped disks. Not to mention the difference in possibility of serious injury or death.

9492973,comment,9485716,9488150,0,0,CyberDildonics,,,"> The Bitcoin network is doomed to throw money out of the window, hundreds of millions every year for processing not even enough transaction to make a Raspberry Pi sweat.<p>The fundamental flaw is that you are correlating the hashing power with the number of transactions that can processed, but the two are unrelated.  If there were 100MB blocks the hashing power could stay the same yet the number of transactions would be 100 times as large.  One of the reasons bitcoin works so well is that this scenario will be phased in gradually.  By the time transaction volume is 100 times what it is now, the electricity cost per transaction will be in line with the cost of a transaction, and the mining bonus per block will be less and less necessary and become a smaller part of the profit from mining.<p>Electricity cost will actually drop in price significantly due to solar, but again this doesn&#x27;t even matter as the system of incentives drives mining.<p>As was mentioned before (not by me) this is extremely misleading at best (and really outright untrue).  Mining costs adjust to the amount of money miners are making.  The block rewards are supposed to be a temporary measure to gradually introduce more supply while being an extra reward to the miners as the network gets started.  If mining wasn&#x27;t profitable, miners wouldn&#x27;t do it.<p>You could make an argument for transaction fees eventually being too expensive for typical transactions, but to say that mining is some inherent cost is ridiculous, since it adjusts to the amount of money that can be made by mining.<p>Crypto currencies are difficult for people to understand, because really it isn&#x27;t common for people to have a good handle on proper incentive structures to drive people&#x27;s behavior.",1430839320

As a kid, you have no freedom until the age of 16 where you have the POSSIBILITY of owning a car/borrowing your parent&#x27;s car.  We had bikes, but the nearest anything was 1-1.5 miles away, and there were very little sidewalks or safe places to bike.  Nothing was convenient without a car.<p>I went to school in a small/medium city (Champaign/Urbana) and loved it.  It was the perfect mix of having a city and space for a small suburban life.  I lived in a house that was off campus, and was within walking distance to downtown and busing distance to the bars/main campus.  It was peaceful and crazy when I wanted it to be.<p>I now live in Chicago and while I love the convenience of everything(huge advocate of all things public transit), I miss being able to easily just disconnect from urban life.<p>My next move will probably be somewhere warmer, but it&#x27;ll probably be in a small/medium sized city for sure.",1430838300

Lately I&#x27;ve been picking up hobbies, like wood working or building more hardware centered projects because day-to-day I design and produce software, which itself is intangible.<p>My girlfriend is from upstate New York, and her father is a farmer. It&#x27;s backbreaking work to run a farm if you&#x27;re mostly by yourself, hiring farm hands when necessary, and when ROI is sufficient. Yet, at the same time, the &quot;Mega farms&quot; of corporations tend to use a lot of hands BUT also inappropriate a lot of tech.<p>There seems to be a middle ground where, like you mentioned, a tech+farm group could be formed either members own their own small plots, or own one together. The burden of tech costs could be spread amongst the members, but the tech can be incorporated to satisfy the intellectual engineering approach to things, as well as the &quot;close to nature&quot; manual labor wants.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m rambling...

It&#x27;s not hard - just write a sane job ad with realistic requirements and don&#x27;t be intimidating. Your hiring funnel is something you really want to optimize, and many of these companies don&#x27;t seem to be paying much attention to doing that at all.",1430838242

Making profit off of it isn&#x27;t intrinsically value-creating.<p>Software <i>does</i> take effort to make, and being comfortable finding ways to monetize it means more programmers can afford to create things like this. Not everyone has as enough free time to make all the things we want to pro bono. Many people have jobs (often for other people who <i>did</i> figure out how to monetize their own ideas).<p>So I&#x27;m all in favour of developers practicing asking/answering that question, because often finding the answer is what allows them to actually pursue those ideas.

On Debian and Ubuntu, the ifupdown package provides traditional networking configuration, and network-manager the &quot;desktop roaming&quot; networking configuration. They integrate with the init system like other services (and arguably a bit tighter) but they are still separate components.<p>So yes - as you say the networking configuration is written into the init scripts themselves, but the init scripts are provided by the distribution&#x27;s networking components, not by the init system component.<p>And indeed the systemd switch in 15.04 - a replacement of init system - has happened but the networking configuration mechanism (ifupdown) remains. Both before and after the init system <i>triggers</i> the networking to be configured, but the init system is not the component that does the work.",1430838068

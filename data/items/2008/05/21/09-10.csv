His language comparative analysis is interesting because it is informed, argumented and ...well, funny. Read this passage, for example:<p>>Well, they're just like the Smalltalk folks, who waited forever to replace C++, and then Java came along and screwed them royally, and permanently. Oops. Ruby's doing exactly that to Python, right now, today. Practically overnight.<p>He just points out at some major architectural flaws in Python (like the scoping issues leading to selfSelfself and unreadable code, and then the whitespace...) and argues that Ruby has superseded both Perl and Python in many ways. That does not mean he does not LIKE Python. His is just an engineer's analysis, not an emotional judgement.<p>offtopic:<p>I -- on the other hand -- am emotionally scarred by Python having tried to take it into my system over a couple of years and having failed to love it. Then Ruby came along... ;)",1211363927

195868,comment,195160,195570,0,0,cousin_it,,,"You are in a state of sin :-) Don't talk about random sequences, talk about random generators. There's an unambiguous definition of ""true random number generator"" in terms of probabilities, joint probabilities etc., but there's no way to determine if a given string of numbers is random, and in fact no definition of a ""random string of numbers"" other than ""the output of a random number generator"".",1211363752

195865,comment,195423,195423,0,0,taw,,,"Main differences:<p>Django doesn't have good support for testing. Rails does.<p>Django doesn't allow clean separation between business logic and presentation logic, forcing both into its ""views"". Rails does.<p>Django doesn't have migration and deployment system. Rails does.<p>Rails is stable 2.0. With Django you have to use SVN+QuerySetRefactor+NewFormsAdmin+YourOwnHacks branch to get anything done. It's not documented anywhere (and not using svn+qsr+nfa+yoh is highly discouraged by django devs).<p>For me Python vs Ruby was really a tiny issue compared to these four. I like Ruby marginally more but Python was never painful to me, Django is.",1211363341

So, the original submitter needs to immediately post a comment that is the original .pdf link.<p>If HN scribd damage occurs on that link, then we will find other ways to route around that damage, for example, by using tinyurl.<p>Down with scribd!!!",1211363244

I don't have a car, so it's pretty much guaranteed I would never go to the office if it weren't close.<p>But I'd probably enjoy having an office to go to a couple of days a week.

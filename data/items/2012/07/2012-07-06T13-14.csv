It has 7 weeks worth of classes and teaches you a tonne in that time. It is a class targeted specifically at ""I know some basic programming but what do I do to get to the next level?"" people.<p>The official version of the class is over, but nothing stops you from joining today, watching the videos, doing the assignments etc.<p>Since one of your aims is to 'learn from great coders' this should be right up your alley since Peter is one of the best developers in the world and you can see him developing multiple programs and refining them step by step till they are gems of elegant code, and you can trawl the forums to see questions people asked and answers to them.<p>Once you work through the class - should take you 7 weeks if you are disciplined -and you understand all the techniques demonstrated there, you'll be in good shape to start/join an open source project in a domain of your interest.<p>And oh prepare to have your mind blown. Peter Norvig is one seriously good developer.<p>Good Luck.",1341583090

4207700,comment,4207507,4207507,11,0,abtinf,,,"This is a pretty standard example of capital controls being implemented in non-free countries by the bureaucratic elite in order to impose hidden costs on their people and to prevent the people from responding rationally to terrible economic policy.<p>The reasons are easy to understand. People are willing to take on the risk of owning hard currency (gold, dollars, euros) if they believe that their nominal currency has greater risk. For example, if a government is spending recklessly, there is serious risk of inflation. Or, if the government has forced interest rates to be too low (well below inflation), then people want to hedge against that too.<p>By forbidding the ownership of hard currency, the government forces individuals to use the local currency. They must save in this currency, which drives down interest rates and provides cheap capital to their government. And it prevents (for a short time) exchange rates from significantly changing, because it effectively limits the supply of the local currency and reduces demand for hard currency.<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention the other reason governments do this - it's a great way to force the people to bear the burden of paying down national debt. If the country has significant debt, then the bureaucratic elite have a huge incentive to pursue a policy of inflation, so that the debt becomes less burdensome over time.

4207692,comment,4207507,4207507,2,0,jswinghammer,,,"The US banned using foreign coins in the mid 19th century as a misguided attempt to bolster patriotism. Americans routinely used Spanish coins in private transactions up until this point. I think (don't entirely remember if) part of the reason was to encourage the use of US silver coins which had been driven out of circulation due to the US government overvaluing gold relative to silver. The basic problem was that by having the US dollar fixed to two exchange rates that one was always being driven out of circulation as the exchange rate changed. This lead to the free silver movement and the Populists getting excited about seeing only silver used to back dollars.<p>This is a misguided attempt to trap people into their own crappy currency. The US currency isn't any better fundamentally but as of now we don't force citizens to hold dollars for savings.",1341582909

I'm a hacker by nature and spend a lot of time now trying to 'hack' the financial world of the Argentine peso. In that sense I think the article is worth posting.<p>Incidentally, Argentina <i>must</i> do this because they have no access to foreign capital markets due to things like seizure of YPF, devaluation of the peso in 2001, and failure to pay back the lenders they still owe, etc. Foreign currency reserves just keep dwindling. As China slows down and demand for soybeans drops, Argentina is really, really going to have a hard time.

4207670,comment,4203626,4207296,1,0,runako,,,">> Which for software would mean an absolute maximum of 10 years, with 3 years much more reasonable.<p>This still devalues the creation of software that is genuine innovation. Think about mainframe software that controls factories, for instance, which can be bought over 10 years after creation. Also consider the prevalence today of Windows XP, which shipped in 2001 (and where any relevant patents would date to the 1990s when it was developed). Microsoft has reluctantly stopped selling it, but I'd argue that we still don't know how long the useful lifespan of WinXP will be. And we're probably ~15 years in from when patents in XP would have been filed.<p>Before artificially segregating software into a ghetto, ask this: would this innovation be worthy of protection if there were a purpose-built device that performs the same function? If the device would be worthy of protection, then it's going to be hard to argue that the software embodiment is somehow worth less protection. (At least it will be hard to argue this with me, but I'm a chauvinist for programmers.)<p>Finally, the argument that the old software becomes irrelevant is congruent with equal protection for software. If old software loses relevance, then so do the patents (and correspondingly their utility to patent trolls). I think you mean precisely the opposite: old innovations in software actually become more relevant, so that everyone wants to use them in their own wares. Nobody rushed to shorten the lifespan of vacuum tube patents because they became irrelevant.<p>I don't think it's reasonable to reduce software patent lifespans to shorter durations than that of the hardware the software runs on, or the cables used to transmit it.",1341582666

The idea is to learn and not necessarily get to the end goal i.e a working app"". I am usually in same boat as you but many of my unfinished side projects have taught me tremendously. For example, I recently worked on a python program to covert financial trasactions in OFX format to csv. It taught me how to use lists, dictionaries in python, file input/output etc. I never finished it actually to the point where my dream was to release it as open source library and I even have a git page for it but I moved on. Even then, I learnt a heck of a lot.<p>""Start Small"". But what does that mean really ? It means that focus on a specific topic and give yourself a task/side project out of it. For example, ""Build a user registration system"".

If I'm out of coffee on Sunday morning, I have an extra trip to the grocery at an inconvenient time. If it's Tuesday morning before work, then my options are more constrained.<p>The larger amount allows a person to hedge against a future shortage for the same cash outlay. The shopper already planned to spend $10, and getting more today gives them flexibility in the future, e.g. the regular weekly shopping trip can be moved from Saturday morning to Monday after work because there is adequate coffee on hand thereby allowing Saturday morning to be spent gardening.<p>Conversely, in terms of flexibility, the discounted coffee does not offer any direct correlation to convenience - I cannot hire someone to go coffee shopping for me on Sunday morning with the savings. Furthermore to achieve the flexibility offered by the larger size, I have to spend significantly more than the $10 I intended and purchase two 10 ounce packages - doubling my coffee expenses for the week -- storing an 10 additional ounces may also be more inconvenient than storing 3.3 additional ounces.<p>People pay for convenience all the time and doing so is economically rational. Without an accounting of how such habits may impact purchase decisions in the overall conclusions are not quite justified.<p>But more importantly, the design of the study based upon an undergraduate student population performing an activity at which they have little experience - grocery shopping - does not necessarily reflect the purchasing habits of more experienced shoppers with a life time of coffee addiction behind them.",1341581378

4207519,comment,4207434,4207434,1,0,locdad,,,"ebook preview:<p>What Is This Book About?<p>This book is about helping people who want to learn how to hack their idea by themselves in order to build the first version of their product.
I wrote this eBook to share my experience and failures with wanna-be entrepreneurs, startup entrepreneurs (business guys) on how they can also become a hacker and build their own products by themselves.
Note: I might write some words you might not be familiar with, but they all mean the same thing. Words like; Programmer is the same as hacker. Programmers are also called hackers in the startup world. They are people who build stuffs with any programming language. Hustler is the same as idea guy or business guy because those who hustle are people who are passionate about the business part of the startup. Pardon me for this. These words are common in the startup world.<p>A little story about myself<p>Im Samuel Ayodele by name; Im a 21 year old and a student. Im passionate about the startup life and I love meeting people who have the entrepreneurial mindset, people who can bring something out of nothing and turn it into something amazing.
How I got started.
I explored a series of checkups with myself on what path I wanted to take in this life - The corporate path or the entrepreneurship path? I made up my mind to follow the entrepreneurship path, a pathway where I could make a dent in the lives of many people.
Ive always wanted to create my own company, impact peoples lives and create jobs for people. I never for once cherished the corporate lifestyle. Im ready to give it all it takes to make my dreams become a reality.
My main aim is to build a brick and mortar businesses and also online businesses. (Startups) I want to make an impact in the online and offline world. Before I move into the brick and mortar business niche however, I want to make a dent in online business first.<p>Getting started<p>In order for me to get started, I searched for books on startups, read up on successful startups and entrepreneurship blogs to get an idea on how to build a startup. For example, some of the Blogs I often read are:
	Paul Graham Essays
	Onstartups
	Jason L Baptiste 
	Jun Loayza
	Yukai- Chou
	StartupProffessionals
	Instigator
	Smart Bear
	Chris Dixon 
	Steve blank
	Lessons learned<p>After understanding what I needed in order to get started, I began thinking about ideas that would add value to peoples life - In the startup world you just cant start a startup for the sake of being called a startup entrepreneur,<p>A startup needs to be created because it will make an impact in someones life.<p>Ive always had a bunch of ideas to start with but the problem is that I begin all of those ideas at once, I have to start first on the one with the highest priority.
So I began pulling together some of these ideas and finally settled for the top three ideas. I decided to email people, (People I know who can be of help to me) of whom I shared my startup idea with them. After mailing them, the some of the replies I got where:
	This has been started before how will yours be different?
	The idea has been implemented, try and search for another idea.
	How will this be different from your competitors? If you believe you can make it in the niche, go ahead with it.
Big thanks to these folks, most especially to the ones who gave me the latter reply. I really learnt from each of their replies. The lesson learned is:
Its 90% sure that your startup idea has been started by someone else. But for you to win big and succeed you must understand the pain youre trying to solve, Why youre different from the rest (competitors). Startups dont kill startups, founders do - If you truly believe in your startup idea, go make it happen.
After thinking of what to do next, I decided to stick with the idea Im truly passionate about. Now, its time for execution, theres a problem however and the problem is, I dont know how to code, Im just an idea guy. So I decided to look at getting a developer to help me.
To get a developer who truly believes in my vision, I started reading articles on how to get a technical cofounder. After consuming articles on how to get a technical person for my startup, I decided to give what Ive learned a try.
I signed up to technical forums, asked friends if they knew people who can code, signed up to startup matchmaking sites like Founder2be, searched for different keywords like Get me a technical cofounder startup hacker on Google. After months of searching for a developer, no success! I became baffled, thinking if I will ever make it past this stage.
One day, I was surfing through 37Signals, and I came across an article titled Theres no room for the idea guy I quickly clicked on the link to get the main reason why DHH (the author of the article) said so.
My main take away from the post is:
The truth is that most everyone has plenty of ideas that could work out to be great business. The kicker is most often the right execution that theyd be responsible for anyway, at the right time, which is almost impossible to predict. The value of The Perfect Idea is very small indeed.
That doesnt mean its useless to have big ideas and plenty of enthusiasm. If youre that guy, youve got a great start. Now pick up a functional skill and help build it your damn self.<p>After digesting the article, I decided to take the urge to learn how to code and build the first version of the product myself!
Before that however, I mailed a bunch of developers asking them if they would love to work with me on my startup idea, The reply I often got was, 
	Nice idea, but Im very busy with projects. Will try and see what I can do.
	I dont think this idea will work out. Besides you dont have enough funds to get started.
	Sorry Sam. Im also working on my projects. Cant help at this moment.
A developer or two agreed to work with me but after sending the product spec to them they decided to back off and tell me they cant continue due to different complications.
Nothing can be more heart breaking than these kind of replies, If a girl I love tells me shes not dating me anymore and that shes bored with the relationship, I wont feel much sadness compared to if a hacker told me that hes not interested anymore. 
Sometimes I feel like giving up but then something keeps telling me to move on. Before I finally jumped on the urge to go learn coding I felt that learning how to code was a waste of time.
One of the things that gave me the confidence to learn coding is how hackers hack in hackathons or startup weekend. I feel inspired whenever I watch these videos. One of the startup movies that inspired me most is the Social Network - I love Marks zeal for hacking on epic shit! My favorite words are Let the Hacking Begin.
My main goal was to learn two programming languages and build my projects with the programming language I cherish the most.  I decided to learn PHP first. I picked up starting eBooks on PHP and I watched videos on how to code in PHP.  Within a month I was done with PHP at least. After that, I decided to move on to Python. Learning python was one of the coolest things that ever happened to me. 
By the time I was done learning Python, I decided to build my project in Python. But before I could build a web app, I will need to learn a web framework for building web applications. So I researched on the Python web framework that will best suit my projects. After my research, I settled down for Django because its a Python web framework for building fast and scalable web applications in no time.
After learning two programming languages and a web framework (Django) I built two projects, (to a stage where users can test it) from this point I can tell you how it feels to be a hacker.
 In this book, I will share with you lessons learned when hacking on my startup idea and make you understand why you should learn how to code. Hopefully, it might help you go about hacking on your startup idea yourself.",1341579802

4207515,comment,4207238,4207238,1,0,VuongN,,,"The site looks good and I love the demo.  I think it's gutsy that you guys have the demo cam showing yourself.  It's definitely a refreshing idea.<p>I do notice a few small problems:<p>1) when you go to demo page and actually view the demo cam streaming the user information menu up top (Login/Register etc.) looks fine.  But going from demo page to the home page once more somehow shows the menu as ""logged in""--the menu says Logout, even though you shouldn't be logged in to see demo.  In any case, it must be something to do with session or the simple loggedin/out logic.<p>2) In the demo page, dialog box on deleting cam or adding cam will actually be covered by flash.  This is a pretty common issue and I believe the solution is to set the flash w-mode: opacity or something of that sort.  It has been a while since I worked with drop down menu and flash :)<p>A suggestion: instead of control buttons of up/down/left/right-- you can definitely add immediate improvements to the experience in 2 levels:
1) bound the keyboard shortcut which should be quite simple. Just trigger the click even on the appropriate button. Don't forget to have a small delay so you don't crash the darn device<p>2) enable dragging of the video: I'm ""thinking""... when the video is loaded, cover the video with a low opacity div (1px gif of 0 opacity?) then bound a mouse listener to the box. Again, you can move the cam according to the mouse movement by checking mousemove and then on delay trigger the click even on your already bound control button.  In fact, the easiest would probably have 9 div arranged in this manner:<p>[1][2][3]<p>[4][5][6]<p>[7][8][9]<p>if mouseenter 5 do nothing... if mouse enters 1 trigger left+up button click, 9-down+right, 8-down and so on.<p>I hope this makes sense. I'm simply looking at the demo and assume the real experience is probably the same and could be improved.<p>Other than that, things look great.  Best of luck to the team!<p>-V.",1341579700

Begin with simple projects that you know are within your reach, even if they are dead simple (make a tic-tac-toe in Django). Completing those projects will boost your morale so you will stay motivated.
Also I would say that you need to build up your Github account into a professional signature that someone would look at and see where your interests are, whether you have potential as an intern / junior dev who may grow to become a good dev, with some coaching and mentorship.
Also, the world is moving towards agile and you are going to impress a lot of people if your activity on Github shows that you have the ability to build software in an agile way.",1341579624

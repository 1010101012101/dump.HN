As someone else calculated there are around 30MB of images.  Quite frankly this should work out okay.  (To my knowledge the iPhone platform tends to be skimpier on the memory.  But then again there is less multi-tasking going on to soak up the extra.)<p>IIRC there was some past differences in iOS versus Android.  Something like iOS prerenders the page to series of tiles so that as you scroll around it is really just showing tiles (think of how Google Maps works) while Android has a display list that is culled to the viewport and then (re)drawn as appropriate.  But both sides were updating and changing how they did things.",1346435936

4460843,comment,4459928,4459928,37,0,grellas,,,"What caught my eye here is the expert handling of procedures for consumer disputes.<p>In legalese, this can be summed up as follows: if you live in the U.S., you agree to binding arbitration and to waive any right to participate in a class action (Section 10); before you can initiate arbitration, you are required to give a notice of dispute to Microsoft and to go through a 60-day period of trying to resolve it informally (10.1); nothing in this arrangement prevents you from taking your dispute through small claims court at any time in lieu of arbitration and whether or not you went through informal negotiations first (10.2); if informal negotiation fails or if you do not use small claims court, you agree to give up your right to litigate your dispute before a judge or jury and to pursue your claims exclusively through binding arbitration under AAA rules (10.3); you agree that your claim will be resolved exclusively ""on an individual basis"" and that it will not be combined with other claims, either in arbitration or in the courts, where a party acts as a representative in a class action (10.4); you agree that the arbitrator can only grant remedies besides a money award (e.g., injunctive relief) only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim (10.5); if you are an individual and you use the services for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less whether or not you are an individual, your dispute will be resolved under the AAA's special simplified-procedure rules for consumer-related disputes (10.5); you are required to initiate your dispute with AAA either in your county of residence or in King County, WA and Microsoft will promptly reimburse you for your filing fees and will pay for the arbitrator's fees and expenses (10.5, 10.6); in the case of such small disputes, if you reject Microsoft's last written offer made before the arbitrator was appointed and thereafter get a better result when an award is made, Microsoft will pay the greater of the award or $1,000, will pay twice your reasonable attorneys' fees, and will reimburse you for expenses that your attorney incurs in preparing and proving the your claim through arbitration (normal AAA rules on these issues apply if your claim exceeds $75,000) (10.6); in turn, Microsoft will ask for reimbursement of the arbitrator's fees and expenses only if the arbitrator finds that your claim was frivolous or filed for an improper purpose (10.6); all claims are subject to a private statute of limitations expiring within one year (10.8).<p>Translated, here is what Microsoft is saying:<p>1. If you have a real problem with us as a consumer, we want to hear about it and deal with it if possible before you initiate a formal fight over it.<p>2. If we can't agree, we will give you every opportunity possible to make your case easily and without procedural barriers <i>outside</i> the regular court system, whether in small claims court or using streamlined AAA procedures in which we pay <i>all</i> the processing costs, including your filing fees.<p>3. If our negotiations with you yielded an offer from us that is less than what you get through a formal process, we will pay you even more, including double your attorneys' fees.<p>4. We will not play games with you by saying that arbitration can be held only on our home turf but will make certain that the prescribed procedures let you fight the battle in your local area, ensuring that you do not face arbitrary obstacles in getting your claim decided.<p>Whether one agrees with the approach or not, the message here is loud and clear: if you deal with Microsoft as a consumer, there will be no juries (i.e., no realistic chances of getting punitive damage awards), no claims by which lawyers try to get nuisance payouts by grinding little claims through the formal court system, no arbitrations by which lawyers try to use complex discovery, etc. to arbitrarily complicate what should be an otherwise straightforward claim, no class actions (either in court or through attempts to aggregate claims in arbitration), and no broad injunctive or declaratory relief remedies that might disrupt an existing business model.<p>Many large companies have tried to use binding arbitration to corral consumers into little boxes from which they can only fight at an unfair disadvantage. Perhaps Microsoft is trying to do the same thing here in reality but I doubt it. I read this as Microsoft's declaring, in effect, ""we have no problem dealing honestly with real complaints about our service but we're sure not about to let ourselves get set up to pay large awards over inflated claims concocted by lawyers - and we are ready to pay a price directly to the aggrieved consumer (e.g., expense reimbursement, attorneys' fees) for the privilege of being free of the mess that is our modern court system.""<p>Sorry to bore people with legalese but this approach is actually quite innovative and worthy of note and I just thought I would highlight it.<p>As to format, it is helpful when this is improved but a contract is a contract and, when it has to cover all sorts of potentially complex legal possibilities for services offered throughout the U.S. and the world, it can only be simplified so much. It can be made clean and clear in its wording - and that is what makes for deft handling from the lawyer side - but, in the end, reading a complex Terms of Service agreement will always remain somewhere between a visit to the dentist and having to read through a 10-page 6-point-type insurance policy in terms of how we can relate to it. That is just a fact of life, unfortunately.",1346435722

You run the risk, basically, of people shooting the messenger.

Even for a very simple version, charge at least $1.99.[1] Don't over engineer it in terms of features within the app, but make sure the core functionality works as advertised for a broad range of folks. There is a massive novelty factor here which I think will create a viral growth of sales. This will allow people who can't beatbox to experience the joy of beatboxing. :-)<p>If it continues to works as advertised as it evolves, I think you could quite easily find yourself either in a licensing agreement (or small acquisition) with Apple. Their Garageband app is packed full of ""smart instruments"" that are in a very similar vein as this. Most of them are quite awesome. My son is obsessed with playing them. They allow even kids to have fun making music and experimenting with sound. Something like this would be a real improvement from what they currently do for ""smart"" drums.<p>So, I think there is an initial awesomeness which is that you could have a successful app, which in itself would be a real accomplishment these days. This concept definitely has the potential. However, I really, really hope to see this picked up and incorporated into a larger tool for creating music in a fun way.<p>Best of luck, guys. Great job.<p>[1] Might be a bit specific in terms of advice, but not knowing your background/experience building and marketing apps, I thought I'd throw it out there.

In this case the condition system may give an attractive architecture, but it is not widely explored and it is not clear how it would integrate into a language like Java. There could be a benefit, but it is not explored by software architects. Apple's Dylan probably had something to it, but it was not widely used.<p>* error handling in interactive systems. That's where the Lisp community used/uses it mostly. The largest effort to use the condition system were in the OS of the MIT Lisp machine descendants - especially the one from Symbolics. It was used both in the development environment - which is tightly integrated in the OS. Most of the development tools were using it. But things like the networking code or the file system were also using it. The user interface is generally slightly more complex than current graphical user interfaces and it was expected that the user used this kind of power. When you get a dialog of restarts presented, the user needs more thinking about how to proceed than with a simple cancel/abort dialog box. There were also applications written using it and for that slightly simpler interfaces were used. For example the restarts were presented in dialogs and not in a debugger context.<p>It takes a bit of re-orientation to imagine a user interface, where the user has the option to repair/retry a failed operation, instead of the usual abort/redo. These benefits are easier to get in an integrated system (-> Lisp, Smalltalk) - a model where several non-integrated tools interact in a condition system is more difficult to imagine.<p>Today, most of the better Common Lisp systems are using the condition system in their environment. There the power can be used, but at the same time it is also easy to ignore and just use a default mode of using the abort restart - without getting the benefits of thinking a bit more and investing the time to use a more complex restart.",1346434516

I started a couple months after this former Googler and our work backgrounds prior to Google are pretty similar.<p>In that time, I started out on an underappreciated starter project, did a hackathon for Hangout, filed some patents for that work, did 20% work for an yet to be announced project, and now building out a completely new yet to be announced product.<p>Google is a place that really allows you to find something that interests you and encourages you to do that.  Internally, people are always looking for people to put in 20% work on their projects; so if you come across something that interests you, nobody is there to stop you.<p>Personally, if I was only to work on one project for my entire tenure, I'd be bored out of my mind and be looking elsewhere for opportunities.  At Google, I can feed by project-ADD within.<p>One thing you learn at Google is that it really humbles you.  You really are working with really intelligent people and you need to have some faith in your fellow coworker.  Everyone has something to contribute and you can learn even more than you can teach/preach.  Much of the issues with this former Googler is that he may have had some good/interesting ideas but he failed at garnering support.

You presumably can't compete on salary; you can offer the chance of a big payout with equity, and you can offer the ability to build their own system with a lot more control over it than they'd have at a big company, both of which will appeal to a certain extent to certain people. Just put yourself in their shoes, and ask why someone with the level of ability you need, and only the most superficial knowledge of your abilities, would come and work for you.<p>>If I can built a MVP and proven it, do I still need technical co-founder?<p>Pretty much by definition no. If you're running a viable business without them then you don't need them. I'm inclined to assume your business just isn't that technical? If you're building a product for programmers then I'd be surprised, but if it's just a business idea that happens to be implemented as a website then it's fine.<p>>I can't imagine people like Paul Allen or Bill Gates were doing all the coding when Microsoft is grossing $1.3 million with 13 employees in 1978.<p>Allen and Gates were about as technical as it was possible to get back then, no?<p>A two-founder company is inherently a lot more trustworthy/easier to hire for than a sole founder (unless the two are married or similar), because it proves at least one other person was convinced by the idea; two founders who retain control, followed by employees who get successively smaller chunks of the equity is the ""normal"" way to build up a company, in so far as such a thing exists.",1346433667

Philosophy and science (ne natural philosophy) developed in the artists faculty and over time became important enough to grant the artists faculty the right to grant doctorates, too, with philosophy leading the way.

If there were an index on movie_person(person_id), this could be an index scan.<p>(EDITED TO ADD: I <i>totally</i> misread the timings in milliseconds for timings in seconds, so most of what I originally wrote is off by a factor of 1000. I'm leaving it here for entertainment value and because you might want to play with the data set in SQLite. But my point is still valid: a vanilla join is comparable in performance to the OP's bloom-filter method.)<p>I'm having a hard time believing that the straightforward join on a data set as small as the OP's sample is really going to take 65 seconds on PostgreSQL.  Maybe that's what EXPLAIN predicts (with spotty stats, I'd wager), but EXPLAIN is not a reliable way to measure performance. For this data, I'd expect real queries to perform much better.<p>EDITED TO ADD:  The OP's article shows the results for EXPLAIN ANALYZE, which ought to have performed the queries.

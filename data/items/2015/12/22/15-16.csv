I was able to create a web server for one of my group&#x27;s web apps in about 5 lines of code.  It&#x27;s a bit weird to wrap one&#x27;s mind around it at first, but then it starts to make a lot of sense.<p>This IPP server is cool, though I&#x27;m not sure what uses it has yet.  Maybe just a handy way to print to disk without having to choose a folder and file name.  Or use as a proxy to redirect print requests to different printers depending on size or type of print job.  Or a way to queue up print requests until off-hours.  This is just off the top of my head and I&#x27;ll bet there are other cool uses as well.",1450799947

The coldest quarter is also, of course, different every year, and not known until after the fact.<p>We use astronomical seasons instead because they are predictable, they are basically the same every year, and they definitively take place on a given date.<p>For the question of starting winter on the solstice vs halfway between solstice and equinox, we do get more cold weather after solstice than before.

For instance, regarding the positive and negative sides of buying a house, if I point out the price, the distance to school/work and the condition of the roof it seems like people blame me for pointing it out... like I was personally and willingly trying to destroy the happiness the best case scenario would  bring if they bought it on the spot.

It&#x27;s like most people don&#x27;t want to see the whole picture, only the positive elements of the whole picture.<p>Now I try to grow up and dodge those situations or let requests for advices pass by.<p>But it&#x27;s not about « intelligence », it&#x27;s more about seeing the whole picture, getting asked about it and being blamed for detailing the obvious (I know next to nothing of carpentry or the real estate market beyond the obvious: &quot;don&#x27;t buy a house on fire&quot;).",1450799892

10778349,comment,10771350,10771353,0,0,WildUtah,,,"Conventional oil production peaked in 2005. That was the year ordinary oil (land and offshore) wells produced their peak quantity of crude oil and condensates.<p>Tar sands, deep water, synthetic fuels, coal and gas conversion, and hydraulically fractured wells have produced a few percent more lately than the plateau of total production from 2005-2011. Those methods start paying at US$70-100 a barrel. The plateau saw prices above US$100 consistently.<p>Demand made itself more efficient in the face of rising prices even as new expensive sources came online. Now the new sources are producing but demand has softened enough with basic efficiency measures that the new unconventional oil cannot command the high prices.<p>Unless things change fast, we&#x27;ll see the worst of all possible effects. New oil ventures will fail and go offline. Low prices will lead to efficiency plans being cancelled. We&#x27;ll have the situation of five years ago again and prices will skyrocket as demand rises and the new unconventional oil is offline.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s exactly what OPEC and Russia are hoping for. They want new oil sources and efficiencies to go away so they can get back on the gravy train. So they&#x27;re flooding the market strategically now to drive prices even lower and put new sources out of business.<p>Since it takes investors and technologies several years to react to changes in price, a fairly steady production could lead to accelerating resonant gyration in prices if OPEC can time it right.<p>It&#x27;s all very exciting, but it doesn&#x27;t change the reality that oil is getting harder and harder to extract. Eventually it will be too expensive to extract more.",1450799252
10778347,comment,10760084,10778249,0,0,VikingCoder,,,"> Life contains a series of problems that need to be solved.<p>And MOST of the problems that MOST people face, have already been solved by the time someone is rich.  As in, seeking food, seeking shelter, seeking transportation, clothing, future security...<p>> If you solve them adequately, then you are happy and fulfilled.<p>That&#x27;s not how my life works.  My daughter just had heart surgery.  It cost over $50,000.  My cut of that was about $2,000.  It saved her life.  You still think I&#x27;d rather be POOR today?<p>> If you don&#x27;t solve them at all, then you are unhappy.<p>In my experience, there are two broad types of people - those who imagine how happy they&#x27;ll be after they accomplish their list of tasks (you), and those who are generally happy and find a way to put joy into the things they&#x27;re doing (me).  Since I&#x27;m generally happy, the gravy for me is getting to experience more out of this life and help other people.<p>> How to earn the love of your family, friends, and community.<p>I don&#x27;t believe I do &quot;earn the love of my family, friends.&quot;  I think my family and friends love me unconditionally.<p>> How to retain a sense of control over your destiny.<p>We&#x27;re talking about POOR today.  ACTUALLY POOR.  And ACTUALLY POOR people do not have nearly as much control over their destiny as you&#x27;re painting.<p>> Fly a Mig? Christ man, talk about missing the point.<p>I specifically asked you to name TWO things a poor person can actually do today, that a rich person couldn&#x27;t do 20 years ago.  You&#x27;re full of criticism for my point of view, but I&#x27;ve given you a terribly simple challenge, and you have not risen to it.  If you want me to understand your point, then try STATING your point (via examples), rather than criticizing mine.<p>And to defend myself, I find that in debate it&#x27;s best to try to understand the most charitable rendition of the other person&#x27;s argument.  You&#x27;re breezing right past several of my points: &quot;Influence politics.  Invest in corporations, like SOLAR power, WIND power, NUCLEAR power. Fund start-ups.  Help stabilize and transform former Soviet Block countries.&quot;  Those are all, in how I view them, about helping people.  Most of my other ones were based on the fact that a rich person isn&#x27;t struggling to survive, and is instead seeking to squeeze as much out of this life as possible.  Carpe diem.  And evidence points to helping people, and having unique experiences, as being far more enjoyable than merely having possessions.  So, if I picture myself as rich 20 years ago, I come up with things (for that list) that a poor person could not do today, but that would make me happy.<p>If you want to attempt to convince me, then why don&#x27;t you try to list concrete examples of things a poor person could do today, that a rich person 20 years ago could not do.  Since that&#x27;s the actual topic at hand.<p>And fine, let&#x27;s take the most charitable form of your argument - Having The Internet Is Awesome.  Fine.  2 billion people have access to the Internet.  That means roughly 5 billion people do not.  Perhaps the agreement that you and I can make is that it would suck to be poor, among those 5 billion people today.",1450799243

One is made of organic material, another made of silicon and glass. In the future, I see this boundary blurring, whether in the form of digital prosthetic eyes for the blind (which inevitably would possess the hardware ability to capture video to a file) or in being able to understand, capture, and save neural signals out of our biological eyes directly.

OPEC has been in open revolt for a long time and can no longer function as a unified front against the Western consuming countries.  Smaller OPEC producers have long ignored the quotas, battling for marketshare while comfortable in the knowledge that Saudi Arabia would lower their production to maintain price targets.  The Saudis have grown tired of that role—this current salvo is as much a move against their fellow OPEC members as it is new Western production.<p>This current situation is the Saudi&#x27;s public recognition that OPEC has failed, the final culmination of a decline that began decades ago.<p>Saudi Arabia is facing the prospect of increased production on several fronts for both geopolitical reasons (Iran) and technological (America, deep sea, Canadian oil sands, etc).

The effect comes with the context. An `IO a` would translate to a lazy value, namely a function, which could be a continuation. There&#x27;s nothing stopping you from storing a continuation in a field. You can manipulate the `a` just like any value, and the &quot;IO&quot; with handlers -- just as you do with monads.<p>> possibly skip the rest of the computation, returning an Error instead<p>Yes, but  that&#x27;s not all Either says. It says &quot;return an error or a value of type a&quot;. In imperative code that makes less sense. What you want to say is: &quot;throw an exception or don&#x27;t (and return whatever value it is that the function returns)&quot;. The type of the normal return value is not recorded in the Either.<p>> The point is the reason you have to use the horrible monad transformers is that the order in which you evaluate these effects matters<p>You need monad transformers not because of ordering, but because monads don&#x27;t generally compose. Or it&#x27;s a bit reversed: because monads don&#x27;t compose they are sensitive to <i>accidental</i> ordering (whether you care about the order or not), which makes monad transformers tricky. With continuations you have the choice of when to be sensitive to order and when not to.<p>For example, in the imperative case, you <i>could</i> encode the information &quot;if there&#x27;s an early error, are later log statements recorded, or not?&quot; directly in the type, (I think) but I don&#x27;t see any reason to. In Haskell you must because the types need to be nested in one particular way according to the transformer.<p>In any case, my claim is as follows: <i>if</i> you generally prefer the imperative way of doing effects (like in Java, OCaml, F#, Scheme, JS, Python, Clojure, Erlang etc.) -- as I do -- <i>then</i> continuations are far more natural than monads. If you prefer the PFP way, you should stick to monads (or if using Haskell, must stick to monads).",1450797742

It makes sense then that Otto uses Vagrant to achieve it&#x27;s goal, but it&#x27;s a bit confusing to call it a &quot;successor&quot; then. Vagrant is a great piece of tooling, and it&#x27;s good to see that it lives on despite confusing messaging.<p>Just reading this announcement, it seems 1.8 is an amazing release.

Stop being an asshole.&quot; This is also true for comments that get downvoted.<p>As an example, I had a post where I said the concept of payday loans is not a bad one while simultaneously denouncing the predatory practices that payday loan companies employ. You borrow a small money for 15 days, pay back the loan plus 20% ($200 + 20% in fees and interest = $240), and call it a day.

For example, typical metro desk stories are always popular but not always overly staffed because the news pretty much writes itself.  Education takes more work, but it&#x27;s not that important to audience so you pick a person or two wisely to run it, maybe throw a general assignment reporter on a few stories.  Investigative pieces, for those you throw your best people and if it&#x27;s newsworthy - that is, in the matter of public interest - you wastefully throw resources at it to get the story out.  You can&#x27;t do that for every story though, so editorial meetings are harsh.<p>The only difference is that for traditional print, the metrics lagged behind by months to a year (these were done by circulation analysts or media analysis companies that do this for a living, with lots of phone calls and even more interpolation).  With interpolation, you can imagine how you can under- or overestimate a situation.  With print interpolation, it&#x27;s even worse: they would ask people if they didn&#x27;t read a newspaper this week, did they at least glance at one that someone held, or left on a bench?  If they said yes, they got a checkmark for a partial reach.  Based on these delayed and inaccurate numbers, people sometimes got or lost their jobs.  More often, they got reassigned to do something else. It&#x27;s always been like that.<p>Now, with near-realtime feedback, you better know how a piece or a series or a section front is doing and can react to it in a more timely manner and make adjustments (ex: throw more people on the project, or pull people away from it and have them try something else).  For example, ebola as a news topic is not doing so well now because it&#x27;s pretty much contained, so lets get that reporter onto something else.<p>Don&#x27;t assume that this modernization change is going to be a rowship with a whip and a piper. Besos has a decent track record on enabling journalists to do their job better, seen both from the outside and the inside.  And yeah, metrics can be misread, misused and misinterpreted, but that&#x27;s always been a possibility.",1450796729

It&#x27;s much nicer if you can see which methods are the throwey ones immediately - =/<- is a real sweet spot in terms of having the difference be visible but not overly intrusive.<p>> But that&#x27;s the opposite of a problem. That&#x27;s like using `IO a` outside of an IO monad. You want the function to only be called in the right context (an appropriate handler is in effect).<p>Disagree. I want to be able to have a value of type IO a outside a method - e.g. in a static field. More generally it&#x27;s really huge to be able to just treat these things as ordinary values that I can manipulate using the ordinary rules of the language.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure if the same effects would make sense, though. For example, Either is a monadic value which doesn&#x27;t make sense in an imperative setting.<p>The two effects are &quot;possibly skip the rest of the computation, returning an Error instead&quot; and &quot;record a programatically-accessible Log&quot; - I think those both make sense. The point is the reason you have to use the horrible monad transformers is that the order in which you evaluate these effects matters - if there&#x27;s an early error, are later log statements recorded, or not? There are more complicated cases when e.g. catching I/O errors.",1450796435

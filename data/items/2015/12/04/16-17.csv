10677432,comment,10676206,10676206,0,0,asQuirreL,,,"A lot of the observations in this article are very interesting, but personally, I drew different conclusions.<p>The first one is the main thesis of the post which is that some people have an innate ability to program that others do not possess, and that this is a thing that cannot be learnt. As a result, telling people that it is &quot;easy to code&quot; is a lie.<p>Firstly, it is actually not clear to me that this ability to pick up programming principles cannot be taught. All we know is that our <i>current methods</i> of teaching yield a double hump distribution for programming ability.<p>Secondly, if people were actually saying &quot;you will find coding easy&quot; to anyone and everyone then I agree that they are probably concealing the truth. But actually, if you read the tagline on the example given (The Year of Code initiative) it says:<p>> Start coding this year, it&#x27;s easier than you think.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s easier <i>than you think</i>&quot; (emphasis mine). This is quite a different statement to a flat out &quot;it&#x27;s easy&quot;, and it&#x27;s one I agree with. To most people, coding appears difficult because they simply don&#x27;t know the answers to a few key questions (E.g. Where do I write the code? What do I do to run my code? How does the computer understand what I&#x27;ve written?). The (basic) answers to these questions are comprehensible to most people, and furnish them with the ability to write code (maybe not well, but that&#x27;s a whole other story).<p>Next observation:<p>> Folks, which industries/professions give up their own free time to provide free/open training to people wishing to enter the sector? Curious<p>The fact that only the software development industry seems to do this is painted as a negative thing in the article. Why is that? I ask because this is a fact I think we should be proud of. I personally enjoy what I do so much, that I happily spend time out of my week, teaching it to others for free. I don&#x27;t do this because I think all the people I teach will go on to become successful software engineers, but rather because I want to widen the net, and expose more people to what we do, because for some of them (maybe even just one of them) this might be their &quot;true calling&quot;.<p>I got into programming originally from watching a cousin of mine editing the themes of his Wordpress blog. He went on to study English Literature and Psychology; To him, coding was just this tool that allowed him to publish his views, but to my 9 year old self, watching him, it really struck a chord and I was hooked. Now, there is not a thing in the world I could imagine myself doing rather than writing code and loving every minute of it (And no amount of &quot;social status&quot; is going to turn me to a life of law, medicine or architecture). What an opportunity I would have lost if I had not seen my cousin working on his blog... Every week-long learn to code course, and every &quot;hour of code&quot; initiative works towards bringing such opportunities to the wider public.<p>Finally, on the role of Computer Science degrees: I am currently in my final year of a Masters in CS, which I have also enjoyed studying immensely. I would not say that it has contributed directly to my skills as a software engineer, but the things I have learnt have changed the ways in which I approach problems. Very few people write structural induction proofs, loop invariants or abstract specifications to prove the correctness of their programs, but I have found them to be great ways to think about how to write better code. These skills, however, are complementary to those that make a good software engineer, not a substitute. There&#x27;s no way to prove yourself out of a rat&#x27;s nest of class hierarchies and control structures.",1449248366

10677429,comment,10672804,10677092,0,0,munificent,,,"> Why would people want to work longer? As much as I enjoy technology, working is the least pleasant part of my life.<p>I think modern industrial civilization encourages a sort of compartmentalization of roles and terms that isn&#x27;t actually real. Certainly, for many people, their <i>job</i> is not a pleasant part of their life. From that angle, sure, no one wants to keep doing that until the day they die.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean the alternative—pure idle leisure—is that great either. Doing nothing sounds awesome when you&#x27;re burnt out, but after a week or two of it, most people will start chewing on the wallpaper.<p>This dichotomy that &quot;everything that you do for money is unpleasant and unsatisfying&quot; and &quot;everything that is recreational is easy and unchallenging&quot; is false. There is a whole spectrum of difficulty, reward, and monetary compensation and jobs, hobbies, recreations and pastimes occupy all sorts of points on it.<p>For most people, they want to spend a good portion of their time doing things that are <i>rewarding</i>, and not necessarily <i>easy</i>. Being retired just means you can optimize for personal satisfaction without having to also optimize for monetary gain.<p>If I could retire today, sure, I&#x27;d get a bit more sleep. But I&#x27;d also hack more open source code, write more books, and volunteer. Those are difficult things (especially that middle one). Does that make them &quot;work&quot;? In the sense of &quot;working on the book&quot;, &quot;my life&#x27;s work&quot;, etc. yes. But is it &quot;work&quot; in the sense of &quot;thing I&#x27;d only do for money&quot;?

The Earth just doesn&#x27;t <i>need</i> sexagenarians to be working, but it doesn&#x27;t <i>need</i> them to exit the workforce, either.<p>When you raise the state pension age, you aren&#x27;t affecting those with enough personal savings to retire earlier.  You are only affecting those who could not stop working at that age without additional financial support of the state.  So poor people with lower-paying jobs get to face down the possibility that they may eventually be fired after their first day of not being alive enough to come in to work.  Great for morale, I&#x27;m sure.~<p>People with enough money will still be retiring at 50 or 60, or whenever they think they have enough to count down their death clock to zero and still have a little left over.<p>It seems a lot like micromanager Lumbergh from <i>Office Space</i> saying, &quot;Yeah, we&#x27;re running a little behind on the ol&#x27; pension plan here, so I&#x27;m gonna need you to come in when you&#x27;re 65... and 66 too.

No matter what it exactly looks like you would probably introduce a preferred reference frame, the frame in which the space quanta are at rest. Or looking at it the other way round, you would observe different lengths when you measure those space quanta from different reference frames no matter what the exact structure is but that contradicts the assumption that they are fundamental and have observer independent properties.<p>Well, you can make a Lorentz invariant theory of an ideal gas, this gives you what&#x27;s called a relativistic fluid. This can be formulated in a completely Lorentz invariant way, meaning that things like the temperature and the average speed of the particles will be the same for every observer. This also implies that the average distance between particles will be the same for all observers. Which combined with the average speed, will give you a characteristic time.<p>So supposing you simply freeze a relativistic fluid in place you&#x27;ll get an amorphous solid with a characteristic length scale and characteristic time scale. Which are both Lorentz invariant.<p>>Quantum physics and special relativity fit nicely together, the standard model and its parts are relativistic quantum field theories. The problems arise when one tries to combine general relativity and quantum physics. When someone says quantum physics and relativity are incompatible he pretty surly means general relativity not special relativity.<p>I was talking about general relativity; quantum field theories almost always use special relativity, it&#x27;s trivial to combine those two. But it is even possible to extend (classical) Yang-Mills field theory from special to general relativity in a very natural way.

And learn-to-code merchants who say &quot;Coding is easy!&quot; are a bit untruthful in the infomercial kind of way.

Sure, the lack of career-path guarantees sucks, but that anarchy also benefits us. If I can get my hands on a computer, I can learn to code on my own (with lots of hard work, yes), build what I dream of, change my life. I can sidestep red tape, bias, prejudice, and credentialism that might work against me elsewhere.<p>#2 - I dislike the vague word &#x27;aptitude&#x27;, which the author uses many times. The idea of &#x27;aptitude&#x27; may help distinguish Mozart from Salieri, but not Salieri from his cousin Fred. What I mean is, at the level most of us operate at, mightn&#x27;t factors like motivation, persistence, and health affect us more than &#x27;aptitude&#x27;?

And following that idea the 10% remaining I guess maybe shot dead with some agile process.<p>However, it is not the case when the specifications are clearly having ambiguous non resolvable issues.<p>Your stack sux big: the cloud, the OS the internet itself have design flaws. Each of this layers in the stack is adding coupling (requirements), costs, surface of vulnerabilities uncertainties (thus diminishing SLA).<p>Building a complicated architecture by taping a stack is easy. You just hire 23 yo coders saying they can solve any NP problems because o notation are old, thus boring, thus deprecated. And then you have your never ending shiping date coming until your &quot;new feature of death that is based on an un solvable problems&quot; will not ship.<p>Thus, a cost matrix for True,False/positive,negative like in signal processing used for assessing costs of software is still a freaking good idea. But it is hardly self taught.<p>Related to this is QA. Measuring non conformities and their costs. This part is the most overlooked. It is where business is done. Non conformities are non predictable by nature, but my experience is that during the lifecycle of an application that is where most of the money is spent. It is hardly self taught. Part of a boring curicurlum.<p>Petri diagram (State-transition diagram): I met no coders able to read or write them, especially in asynch programming. And they love to add states (for each new states there is n + 1 new transitions possibles added to the diagram). Part of the education in electronics.<p>Documentation: new developers don&#x27;t know how to write or read. A craftsman provides words with definitions. Coders don&#x27;t care to properly put down definitions: it is too waterfall/ISO/ITIL heavy processes. Believe I had to fix a code where a developer confused a shit of paper with a page increasing costs by 2 for customers. Reading and writing in french and english where mandatory in my university. And it was boring.<p>Legal: IP does not say copy pasting code from internet to put it in your code is OK. For instance code on stackoverflow is not open source. You cannot do free sofware on your work time and claim it belongs solely to you without any explicit agreement from employers. IP requires teaching.<p>Actual coders jumping from one technological sect to the others (RDMS, node, GO, nosql, async, OOP, functional, POSIX, unikernel, container) are nothing else than monkeys or mechanical turks.<p>I refer to Feynman what is science essay regarding the monkeys. Being able to make a 100$/month web server make a nice hello world in angular JS is not what makes economy better. Building is a thought process that must encompass the investment, the costs of operations, the time to market, the legal and financial risks, the control of defects and the measure of the conformity with the requirements.<p>IT has became a religion where consensus prevails on the technological tools being the solution. Forbidding an in depth analysis that would be conflictual about the adequation between what people wish (being coder to pay the bills because we are lacking of jobs and it is well paid) and what the economy needs (stuff that works better for less bucks).<p>Yes being a programmer is either being born by luck in an aristocracy that need no excuse or a fraud that needs to secure is paycheck by pretending to have an added value.<p>Remember people are having student loans. They have an incentive to perseverate in a way they constantly fail.<p>People are not altruistic by nature when it comes to their own beefsteak (or tofu). Education bubble is creating a toxic situation for which corporations are not the answer (who will watch the watchmen?).<p>We have over instructed (in technology) under educated (in humanity and science) masses of students that sux because  their abilities to speak, write, reason and communicate is hindered by a deficient education that forget to make them think and argue like grown ups.<p>It is not an IT bubble we are facing, it is an education bubble that takes its roots in the 1980s and for which the future of yet 3 generations is engulfed both in debt (public in Europe, private in the USA) and in failures (high unemployment rates because organisational structures did not adapt to the qualification like toyota did).<p>Education is not a good. It is a necessity for a sane society. And modern education fails at delivering adequate citizens. However it delivers numerous cheap incompetent interchangeable obedient workers preventing a power struggle inside the structures.<p>Saying NO to bullshits is the first added value of a coder.

The best of us will still make mistakes; plenty of us will always be incapable of writing well. Once upon a time the idea that everyone needed to know how to write was laughable. These days, it&#x27;s arguable how well everyone needs to be able to write, but there&#x27;s a general agreement that it&#x27;s worth giving people the opportunity to reach at least a basic level of competency, even if their daily lives require little writing.<p>I had a miserable time learning to write (i.e., failed many assignments) until a few things fell into place, and I saw how writing could be an important part of thinking, learning, feeling, expressing, etc. I had a miserable time learning to code through coursework in highschool and college until a few things fell into place and I saw how code could be an important part of thinking, learning, feeling, expressing, etc.<p>How did/do we sell everyone on trying to learn to write human language?

These might be looking for patterns in what the better performers do differently, which might then give some ideas for how to train less experienced performers.<p>Some elite sports teams and athletes also use mocap technology to analyse their form and look for details that are difficult to see with human eyes in real time.<p>The challenge is that even state-of-the-art mocap technology is still a very long way from modelling the full complexity of the human musculoskeletal system. Remember that a lot of what you see in games, and particularly in big budget movies, was originally based on mocap data but then manually refined by skilled people for a considerable period of time. The mocap is certainly a useful starting point and it’s getting better all the time, but there’s a long way to go before it will get the fine details right.<p>That said, even with today’s systems, the amount of data you get from a decent mocap set-up means there is a lot you can investigate, as long as you know what you want to look for. As you say, there are a lot of degrees of freedom in a human body, and coming up with the right abstractions to capture the important details is a challenge in itself.<p>[1] I help to run www.ballroomgenie.com, which is a training aid featuring animations of ballroom moves using mocap-driven CGI instead of traditional live video footage. This lets us show various useful effects that live footage can’t, typically because of physics or because in our little niche market no-one can afford movie-level camera set-ups and editing to record the same action from many different perspectives simultaneously. On the other hand, even working with high calibre performers and studio as we do, it still takes a lot of work to get acceptable quality, and we’re still a long way from being able to reproduce truly lifelike footage. This is partly because we don’t have a Hollywood budget and a whole team of people to get each animation just right, but it’s also because as far as I know the technology to model a human body accurately enough that things like contact and pressure are spot on simply doesn’t exist yet.",1449246997

I mean, yes, it was totally do-able (MS via ASIO4ALL, I know there were a few Linux based music systems even that ran on Atom netbooks), but plug-and-play wasn&#x27;t quite the same. Even audio cards had some driver issues in the MS realm, speaking from personal experience.<p>It&#x27;s rather sad because the MS environment allowed for a lot of homebrew plugins - the VSTs.

When I looked at the details these systems are often not great replacements. So you&#x27;re replacing aging, poorly written information systems with aging / non user friendly / difficult to customise information systems.<p>I would like to suggest some things for you guys:<p>1. Instead of creating one large hospital management system from scratch, how about smaller systems that can be linked together? eg. patient records system / laboratory system / pharmacy dispensing system / billing system / etc. The systems I mention here have fairly minimal dependencies between each other. This gives you the time to create a best of breed system before moving onto other stuff. It also allows hospitals to be able to use your stuff without ripping out everything they already have!<p>2. Think about how a hospital would customise your system. New fields, forms, reports, workflows, logic, etc. And how these customisations would survive an upgrade of the core system.<p>Anyway, I hope you have success with the project and I wish you luck. I&#x27;ll definitely be keeping an eye on it!",1449245964

Lack of exercise, overconsumption of alcohol, being overweight, these things all decrease the functioning of your immune system, thus inviting disease.  Are they morally reprehensible?  And how does one way the cost benefit of the genetic modifications?  We already have a substantial number of people on immunosuppressants for transplants, among other things.  Is it okay for them to invite communicable disease because they would die otherwise?  If so, where is the line where it is acceptable to compromise your immune system?<p>> in which known risks of harms to others exist and are ignored<p>What level of possible risk defines an immoral action?  If we compare it to driving, there&#x27;s a known risk that I&#x27;m going to kill someone while driving.  With genetic modification, there&#x27;s a very low assumed risk because we honestly haven&#x27;t the faintest idea what&#x27;s going to happen.  The assumption of benefit is about the same as the assumption of detriment.<p>> cases where risks of harm exist which would have been discovered with due care and are unknown to the actor due to their lack of concern, are often also considered wrong despite the absence of specific ill intent.<p>This is a more nuanced area, especially in medicine.  We have a lot of medical research that was enabled, or greatly hastened, by experiments undertaken with little knowledge of what the outcome would be.  This would have the advantage of the subjects providing consent, since they seem to be acutely aware that there could be serious side effects.  How far can we go without actually applying this research to people?  How long will it take to get there, and how much time will trying the research on people save?  How many lives could be saved by trying it on people now?<p>> due care<p>I also disagree with the use of this term.  What is &quot;due care&quot;, and at what point have you satisfied it?  It seems to me that if you get to the point where you know all of the potential outcomes, the value of actually doing the experiment is greatly diminished.

I live in one of the poorer states in the US, so my experience may be somewhat skewed.<p>This also brings up one of my concerns with self driving cars.  A vehicles (or and mechanical device) age, they become less reliable.  The brake booster on my truck went out today (20 years old).  I could still brake, but it took significant effort.  I wonder what the failure modes look like on the self driving apparatus, and wether they fail gracefully and safely.  I think it will be important that when we have 10 or 15 year old self driving vehicles on the road that they have engineered in safe failure processes.",1449245449

Students are tasked with writing code, but only limited quantities in very specific areas. That&#x27;s algorithm development and implementation.<p>The answer might be that students should be taking software development or some other degree, but right now CS is the route most students try to take to become developers. This isn&#x27;t a good approach, because at the end they have very little development experience -- only some algorithms and knowledge of computers.<p>I too would answer with &quot;self taught&quot; for how I learned to program -- definitely not from this program thus far.",1449244891

10677026,comment,10675275,10676202,0,0,tangollama,,,"> Also, would like to hear your thoughts on building a new system vs building on top of the many available open source medical systems.<p>Thanks for asking. I&#x27;m sorry in advance that this reply is lengthy. I&#x27;ll try to be succinct.<p>Starting HospitalRun in 2014 was a very intentional, deeply-considered decision on our part, made after reviewing a wide spectrum of the available open source and commercial solutions for our network of developing world charitable hospitals at CURE International.<p>We simply couldn&#x27;t find a solution that we felt could both meet our requirements and be successfully deployed across our network. So without saying anything for or against other health system projects from the past or present, I&#x27;ll say that the following were the driving factors for the decision to build HospitalRun.<p>1) Taking usability very seriously. For us, that doesn&#x27;t just mean UX and clinical usability or even just administrative usability (since there&#x27;s a lot more than just the doctors we&#x27;re trying to serve). It also means easy to setup, easy to administer, and (and we&#x27;re definitely not there yet) easy to contribute code. A developer is already doing A TON for a project like this by absorbing a totally unfamiliar set of business requirements. We want to make the experience of contributing to HospitalRun delightful. Like I said, that&#x27;s aspirational - not reality yet... but that&#x27;s part of what we think &quot;1.0&quot; looks like.<p>2) Architecture choices: we&#x27;re committed to modern, cloud solutions while working in environments where Internet access is unreliable at best. Additionally, deployment devices need to be not just low cost but easy to setup and remotely manageable. In practice, we&#x27;re deploying our early releases of HospitalRun with a small cloud instance paired with a local souped-up Mac mini with a battery backup. CouchDB gives us replication for free and some DNS magic makes it possible for a client device to never need to know if they&#x27;re in the network or out on the Internet.<p>3) Offline access to data in a web browser: Again, we&#x27;re working in areas where Internet reliability is sketchy at best, so beyond the architecture, we wanted to create a portion of the app that works EVEN when there&#x27;s no connectivity at all. That&#x27;s where PouchDB comes in. The offline piece still needs a lot of work, but we get syncing, etc more or less &quot;for free&quot; b/c of the great work in PouchDB . The objective is to create the ability for clinicians to carry records into the field, even when they can&#x27;t connect. This is a real-world requirement from our hospitals that I saw first-hand back in 2011 and inspired us to create both HospitalRun and a previous research database (still in use today) throughout the CURE International network. (ref: <a href=""https://blog.newrelic.com/2013/11/19/cure-uganda-improving-care-global-electronic-medical-records/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.newrelic.com/2013/11/19/cure-uganda-improving-c...</a>)<p>4) It&#x27;s more than just software. We have a goal of codifying the implementation process, and equipping people who want to deploy the solution for a given hospital with the tools to make their volunteerism effective and meaningful as well as the facility successful. Again, that&#x27;s an aspirational goal.<p>5) Real-life customers. HospitalRun has an advantage of being an open source project that is being sponsored by charitable network of hospitals in the developing world, seeking to provide the highest quality surgical care to some of the least served populations. Many of the core team members are interacting with real people who are colleagues, which we generally all agree is good for the requirements process. Together, we&#x27;re trying to build a solution that not only meets the needs of those hospitals but (hopefully) hundreds or thousands more across the majority world.<p>It&#x27;s important to underscore that HospitalRun is not at a 1.0 release yet. We have modules of the system deployed in several CURE hospitals, but there&#x27;s a lot to do before we&#x27;d encourage people to deploy it.<p>Hopefully, exposure like this will help us meet the people, etc that get the project where we think it can, could, and needs to go for the children and families we serve at CURE as well as the thousands of other facilities across the majority/developing world who can be positively effected by it.<p>Btw, many of these points are found in a paper we wrote to respond to this line of questioning (b/c we asked ourselves the same question before pressing &quot;start&quot;) <a href=""http://goo.gl/NCJDnJ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/NCJDnJ</a>",1449244867

Google is part of the W3C, probably a very important part of it.<p>I used to be a W3C member, and remember how this worked. The big companies drove the process. They met privately and hashed things out between themselves. Then it was &quot;debated&quot; but somehow the decision that was arrived at was always the ones they wanted to make.<p>It&#x27;s a way of making it look like an open process when it really isn&#x27;t.<p>In any case, the problem for a developer is the same no matter who is doing the deprecating. You just built on something that&#x27;s going away. You have some users. Not enough to matter to the big companies. You&#x27;re burned. So now next time will you just go ahead and implement the API they want you to. Not unless you&#x27;re an idiot! ;-)<p>Speaking as an idiot of this kind myself.

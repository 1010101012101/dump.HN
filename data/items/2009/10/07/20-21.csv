What I'm not seeing thus far is any experimentally verified proof that IQ/g/academic achievement/whatever is of interest is surely not malleable in the individual case. Rather, what I see repeatedly in the literature are surprising examples of environmental variables having much more power than they were expected to have, both across whole societies over time and in particular individual cases even with haphazard rather than planned environmental variation. But too often there is a leap from the statement that a trait is heritable to the incorrect and invalid conclusion that the trait is not malleable. I have seen that happen often in online discussion since 1992. What discordant identical twins, comparisons between neighboring countries, and other lines of evidence show is what the twin researchers say those lines of evidence show in their new 2009 paper: ""even highly heritable traits can be strongly manipulated by the environment, so heritability has little if anything to do with controllability.""<p>Johnson, Wendy; Turkheimer, Eric; Gottesman, Irving I.; Bouchard Jr., Thomas (2009).

Think about it -- how much of the runtime can truly be shared across connection handlers?<p>The fact that this model doesn't scale is not news. It doesn't require rediscovery. It shouldn't be surprising.

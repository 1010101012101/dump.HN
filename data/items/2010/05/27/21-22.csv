The problem is that people buy their listeners some temporary comfort with their false modesty, but at the same time disempower them in the long term by saying that success is a function of luck.<p>Few people say their success was all luck, but many give it a bigger role than it deservers. It you are successful on a 10% play, it's easy to pass that off as luck. But if you made 10 plays like that, it's not really luck, now, is it?<p>Of course, sometimes the magnitude of the success is mostly luck.",1274997378

They gave a battery of cognitive tests to a group of heavy media multitaskers as well as a group of relatively light ones. They discovered that the heavy multitaskers were much more easily distracted, had significantly less control over their working memory, and were generally much less able to concentrate on a task. Intensive multitaskers are “suckers for irrelevancy,” says Clifford Nass, one professor who did the research. “Everything distracts them.” Merzenich offers an even bleaker assessment: As we multitask online, we are “training our brains to pay attention to the crap.”",1274997122

The fact that Rand choose a menial job, and the way she described the hardship of the labor, I see no reason to interpret it as meaning that he liked the work. I'm not a Rand scholar though and open to being convinced of the opposite.

Actually it's exactly what I said in my previous comment.<p>Besides, my point was that there are several sorts of 'sacrifice' and 'suffering'.

I'm not an expert, but in my experience it's extremely unusual for someone who learns a second language later than about 10 or 12 to ever completely get rid of a noticeable accent.  Of course the first and second languages matter -- native Japanese and French speakers who learn English later in life rarely seem to loose their strong accents.  Speakers of germanic languages seem to have it easier.<p>It would certainly be interesting to hear a sample of the Korean's speech from when he was 18 or 19.  However, I think the reason he speaks English like he grew up in the U.S. is because he put a lot of specific effort into getting his pronunciation absolutely right.<p><i>A serious language learner can get to a very high level of proficiency in a couple years' full-time effort. Some of them have fun, too!</i><p>In general I agree with that.  What the Korean did was clearly overkill for what just about anybody would ever need to do.

1384960,comment,1384485,1384843,0,0,jcl,,,"There are lots of things that could be improved.  Here's my pet peeve:<p>Android regularly checks the Android Market for updates available for your apps.  It doesn't just check for updates to apps you currently have installed, but for any app you ever installed, including ones you later removed.  I guess the logic is that if you uninstalled an app because of a bug, you will want to know when it is updated so that you can try it again.  If Android finds any updates, it posts a little ""market"" icon in the notification bar.  If you select the notification, it takes you to a screen showing your downloads, which lists every app you have ever installed.  From that screen you can update installed apps (one-at-a-time only), and you can reinstall uninstalled apps.<p>The problem is that the download screen only tells you an app is updated <i>if it is currently installed</i>.  There is no way to tell which uninstalled apps have been updated.  So if you have tried out a large number of apps, you can easily be in a situation where the notification icon tells you several apps have updated, but when you go to the download page, all your apps appear up-to-date.  This greatly reduces the value of update notifications.",1274994732

She understands my conviction for building a business and penchant for spending ungodly hours on the computer. She's also an invaluable resource: anytime I have a problem, I talk to her. Almost every time I come out of that conversation with a better, more elegant solution than I could have ever dreamed. Her ability to reason in both a right- and left-brained fashion and communicate to me in my extreme left-brainedness is incredible. It doesn't even matter that she doesn't program: her ability to step back and think in a different, elevated fashion is just so helpful.<p>And that's the thing: I talk with her about everything. She's not a part of the company, but she's incredibly integrated into our workflow. Because she's there with us in everything we do, I think our relationship has actually strengthened — and quite a bit at that. Being able to share this experience with her has been wonderful. She cares deeply about what I do and wants to be a part of it. And I think that's key. Even despite the distance (we spend 9 months out of the year over 3,000 miles apart), we're extremely close and I'm hopeful for our future, notwithstanding the insane hours I put into building the company.<p>And, above everything else, I think that's important. Don't overlook her; instead, integrate her. There are a lot of great tips in this thread, but I'd say if you take anything away, it's this: allow her to fall in love with entrepreneurship as much as you have. If she truly loves you — and I very much believe this to be true — she'll love what you do as well. That's especially true with us: we're entrepreneurs to our core and with everything we have.<p>My girlfriend truly believes in what I am doing and my vision for the future. She supports me in everything I do and without her, I'd probably have given up long ago. Her steadfast support keeps me going.

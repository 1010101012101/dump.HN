6255065,comment,6251087,6253743,1,0,RogerL,,,"Well, the person that referred to the article used the wrong term. Certainly brainteasers don&#x27;t work, and they have been prohibited at Google for awhile. But the recent article stated that there was <i>no</i> correlation between interviewers and job performance. That the beloved hash table, distributed computing, priority queue, red-black tree questions that you pepper people have <i>nothing</i> to do with the quality of the person you hire.<p>Which I have argued many times on here, should be glaringly obvious. Measure what you want to measure. I have never said &quot;I&#x27;m so happy we hired Jane, she just tore up that smart pointer implementation yesterday&quot;. I like and dislike colleagues based not on comp sci algorithms, but whether their code is readable, how many bugs are in it, how quickly they can produce production quality code, whether they are responsible and hit deadlines, if they ask for help when they need it, if they offer help when other need it, if they are creative, if they are doers and achievers, if they take baths (seriously), if they step out of their office and interact once in a while, if they are problem solvers, if they read and keep up with their field, if they are capable of learning, if they write good documentation, if the client likes them, if I like them, if younger people look up to them, if older people feel some pressure because here is somebody up and coming, if when I go to modify their code I only need to change it in one place, and my change fits in naturally without breaking 15 different things (because it is designed with extensibility in mind), and that my heart beats a little faster because their code is just so beautiful. And so on.<p>Google doesn&#x27;t try to measure <i>any</i> of that. At all. And then you (google, not you archangle_one) express mystification at why your interviews do no better than chance. There&#x27;s a clue there, I&#x27;d say. If you don&#x27;t measure job performance, why do you think your measure say anything about job performance?",1377143950

6255034,comment,6253773,6254972,1,0,iyulaev,,,"Question for you - how much more productive were you on your 80th hour than on your zero-th? I ask because I typically work 50 hour weeks. I&#x27;ve pushed to 80 when projects are wrapping up but I find that the extra hours are mostly only useful for rote work like writing/running tests, fixing simple bugs, and not for creative work. In fact most of the most difficult problems I solved in my off hours rather than at my desk. So I&#x27;ve always wondered what the net benefit is of working crazy hours like that in the long term, especially when there&#x27;s always the option of hiring two employees and paying them 1/2 of the salary (I know I prefer x for 40/wk rather than 2x for 80/wk, the marginal cost of that 80th hour is huge!)",1377143357

My specialty is doing the work that turns cool concepts, like a fusion reactor or an ore transport, into a working system.<p>So I took the job, hired 6 engineers, and spent 1996 to 2000 working on the ore car demo. I designed the motors to survive in a harsh mining environment. The car was as simple as possible. Since ore isnt in a hurry, the design optimized at 40 MPH rather than 700 MPH. We didnt need the expense or complexity of magnetic levitation, and found some very rugged wheels made for mining applications.

Had no idea what I was going to do, but just let them know I was done at the end of my two-year commitment.<p>At my going away party, the wives of my co-workers secretly told my girlfriend she was incredibley lucky I was getting out and were happy for her.<p>I ended up starting an eCommerce business and have been doing that - and loving it - for the last 5+ years.

The well-to-wheel efficiency for a Tesla is approximately double the well-to-efficiency of a 55mpg Toyota Prius. The efficiency of providing gas to a station from the raw source is much higher than the efficiency of electricity generation and transmission. However, electric motors are so much more efficient that combustion engines, that electric vehicles win in overall efficiency at the end.

It&#x27;s not. Food, just like humans, is just an assortment of chemicals. There is nothing mysterious about it, there are no hidden secrets that we can&#x27;t discover with a microscope, it&#x27;s just chemicals arranged in a certain pattern.<p>Yes, there may be some of those chemicals that we haven&#x27;t yet recognized as being important to a healthy diet. However, since quite a few people (not just Rob, there&#x27;s an entire community built around this doing DIY Soylent for the past few months) have been fine on Soylent for a significant amount of time, there&#x27;s not much reason to think that we&#x27;re missing anything life-or-death important. We certainly know that there isn&#x27;t anything in your typical fast-food meal that is both important for health and missing from Soylent.<p>It seems like you have two main objections. First, judging from your posts, you really fucking love food. That&#x27;s cool, and I&#x27;m happy that you can get that much enjoyment from eating, but a lot of us don&#x27;t. Second, you seem to think that there&#x27;s a fundamental difference between <i>food</i> and not-food (Soylent). If you look at the chemistry though, there really isn&#x27;t. In fact, Soylent has significantly <i>more</i> healthful nutrients than the average American&#x27;s diet.<p>That all said, nobody is trying to convince you to convert to Soylent.

6254876,comment,6251087,6253465,3,0,geebee,,,"I think part of the problem is that the technical grilling isn&#x27;t necessarily reducing false positives after a certain point.  You may simply be selecting people who have front-loaded data structures in an &quot;exam ready&quot; way and rejecting candidates who have a fine background in this area but aren&#x27;t exam ready.  Do you really reduce false negatives by doing this?  I almost have to wonder if you increase them, since you may simply be selecting for people who know how to prepare for an interview (and who aren&#x27;t so busy with important work that they can afford to drop everything to front load the information).<p>Think of it like this - you have two candidates. The first is exam ready for data structures and algorithms.  You want merge sort?  He whips out mergesort.  You want red-black trees?  You got it.<p>A second candidate is clearly aware of what run time is, and what trade-offs happen in different sorting algorithms.  He&#x27;s clearly aware of what can happen when a binary tree gets out of balance, and is aware of the types of more balanced trees.  However, his knowledge is not exam ready.  He can clearly code, but he starts to fade on the edge cases and in the implementation details.  He mentions the chapter in a well respected data structures and algorithms book he&#x27;d read should this issue come up.<p>My question is, do you really protect yourself against false negatives with a no-hire on candidate #2?  Candidate #1 may simply be someone who has figured out how to hack the programming interview.  He might not be an especially good developer, not especially good at working with clients, with teams, with pushing through and getting it done.  Or he might be very good at this.  I&#x27;m just saying that I doubt that being &quot;exam ready&quot; is much of an indicator beyond the obvious coding ability and awareness of candidate #2.<p>However, this process clearly creates a huge number of false negatives - by bouncing #2, there&#x27;s an excellent chance that you&#x27;re passing on a superb candidate, and for what?  A reduction in false positives that may be close to zero?<p>One thing - I think part of the disagreement on this board may come from the different definition people have for intensely technical interviews.  Some would consider #2 to have passed.  My own experience is that interviewers often do expect an &quot;exam ready&quot; preparation on data structures and algorithms, in addition to a few other branches of computing, which is probably I take a more cynical view of these interviews.",1377140616

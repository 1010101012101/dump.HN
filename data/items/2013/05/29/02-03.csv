5784296,comment,5783967,5784189,6,0,csense,,,"> Pythons guiding philosophy behind the syntax<p>Python's syntax philosophy in a nutshell:  The more your program looks like line noise, the harder it is to read.  Operators should be simple and minimal, operations like list comprehension should match existing usage in English, mathematics, or C.<p>> ruby was just a lot better<p>Here's a Ruby snippet.  I don't want to pick on this particular project [1], rather, I've found that this is typical of Ruby code:<p><pre><code>  state_machine :state, initial: :active do\n    after_transition any => :blocked do |user, transition|\n      # Remove user from all projects and\n      user.users_projects.find_each do |membership|\n        return false unless membership.destroy\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\nWow.  There are colons, absolute value bars, implications, and who-knows-what-else flying everywhere!  It gets worse, elsewhere in the same file there are messy lines like this one with single-arrow implications, question marks and ampersands [2]:<p><pre><code>  scope :not_in_project, ->(project) { project.users.present? ? where(""id not in (:ids)"", ids: project.users.map(&:id) ) : scoped }\n</code></pre>\nSimple, intuitive syntax?  From where I sit, the syntax of Ruby is worse than C++, and approaches Perl levels of awfulness.<p>In most languages, I can at least sort-of grok what's going on from the context when I see unfamiliar operators, but not so in Ruby.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/4caaea824cf51670d11b409efa5701dd74614d2a/app/models/user.rb#L118"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/4caaea824cf51670d1...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/4caaea824cf51670d11b409efa5701dd74614d2a/app/models/user.rb#L143"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/4caaea824cf51670d1...</a>",1369796122

5784277,comment,5781040,5784030,2,0,IgorPartola,,,"> For non-commutative operations (and there are plenty), you'll need a stronger model like serializability or sequential consistency that necessarily blocks to prevent concurrent update (or otherwise aborts concurrent updates).<p>The problem to me seems to be that the interesting problems always come across the case where updates are not commutative. For example, real-time sensor reading where frequent updates completely override previous state are very easy to get right if you don't need the latest data at all times. You simply get recent or slightly stale data, and the service stops responding if all sensor data is old. There are many solutions to this case, and some are less complex than your solution.<p>However, when dealing with a read-update-write type transaction where the values you write depend on the values you read will indeed require stronger guarantees. Here is where a lot of systems get into trouble. They seem to either implement the fuck it mode or attempt to do some kind of distributed locking which usually takes a huge performance hit even if the network is fine.<p>> This is definitely one point in the spectrum; the question is whether you want to give up availability and write performance. But if you look at workloads like those in the Spanner paper, this is reasonable for many applications.<p>Yes, the idea is that the system becomes read-only but the data remains consistent and online. In most workloads that I've seen this is the desired behavior. For some reason I haven't seen this behavior implemented yet, though it's possible I just haven't looked at the right data store.<p>> There's a difference between quorums over replicas over the same data item and quorums over different data items. Using quorums over replicas would help ensure that the replicas provided properties like linearizability or register semantics like Dynamo or other systems that provide an option for ""strong consistency."" But it's not clear to me that quorums over replicas for different data items would provide the same atomicity property--does that make sense?<p>Unfortunately, you lost me here. I am thinking of the quorum over each register as being the pass-fail for whether a transaction can go on. Basically, client A connects to servers X and Y and says ""set t = 1; set s = 2; ... commit;"". During the ..., client B connects to server Y and Z and says ""set u = 9; set t = 3;"". Here, client B should fail since client A has not committed. This is determined by the fact that the majority of the servers (Y and Z) cannot agree that t is available for writing. In this case, client B will receive a ""success"" from Z and a ""fail"" from Y, which will prompt it to roll back the transaction and start over.<p>In other words, move the responsibility to coordinate a successful write from the datastore nodes to the single point: the client.",1369795701

Instead, they have become popular and profitable the old-fashioned way, by creating and filling a need. Even a solution as fundamental as search on the internet is not really helping me lead a better life--though it does make possible the vast stores of knowledge and likely the entire tech sector (including my livelihood).<p>2) Given 1) above, the entire article essentially seems to encourage people to exploit the under-exploited markets of the unexotic by creating needs there and fulfilling them. I don't really see how entrepreneurs can, for example, fix the bureaucracy of Veteran's Affairs, even if they had a turnkey case-handling solution to sell to them.<p>Finally, the author of the article had a pedigree as long as my sleeve, but I didn't see any work in the unexotic fields.<p>Somewhat related thought: where are the non-tech entrepreneurs?

Open data sets are being made available that touch many areas. Here are a few examples of what is currently on the table:<p>Healthcare: Health and Human Services just recently released new data on hospital fees, a major step in creating greater price transparency. In other cases, the open data sets can be used for developing new healthcare-related products and services.<p>Weather: Data related to weather can help feed newscasts, identify weather patterns to help avert danger, or create better information for insurance purposes.<p>Consumers: Private companies are using open data to fight credit card fraud; open data helps consumers reduce energy bills; families may leverage open data to compare healthcare options.<p>Public Safety: New apps and tools may access data related to public safety for emergency response and planning. Platforms will be available at the M2M App Challenge, such as Esri, www.esri.com, to incorporate geospatial data into emergency response efforts.<p>Automotive: Data from the Research Data Exchange provides a variety of data-related services for multi-modal transportation mobility applications with the USDOT ITS Dynamic Mobility Applications (DMA) Program and other connected vehicle research activities.<p>In all, the presidents executive order is intended to help fuel new start-ups and entrepreneurs and to stimulate job growth in the United States.<p>Check out this brief video for more details: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=n603rEnEGXA<p>More info and how to register can be found: http://connectedworldmag.com/conference/index.php?q=app_challenge",1369793895

If you walk into any normal hospital internal medicine floor you'll see about 5 different systems in use, with varying levels of interoperability: the VA, operating what is the largest network of healthcare centers in the country, takes that issue to the next order of magnitude. A lot of paper gets generated at these interfaces. Although the core VA EMR system is solid, there are multiple other systems laid atop it. The VA is attempting to address both the software and processes issue (people outside healthcare don't know this, but the VA is <i>the</i> place to take your career if you wish to do healthcare services research - they're, collectively, the single most innovative group of providers in the country).<p>The main problem lies with the paper backlog of attempting to get people <i>into</i> the system. I'm personally not aware of how/why military personnel's medical records don't transition directly into the VA, but what happens in practice is a gap between military med. and the VA, where vets find themselves forced to file claims. I suspect that this is in large part because the set of ""Vets"" and the set of people qualifying for VA care, while overlapping, are not the same (that assertion comes from anecdote: I had an ex in the military, and when she finished her tours I recall that she was not qualifying for VA care because she hadn't been disabled nor gone career, as she explained it). While it's fair to ask why this process is done on paper, it's worth-while to note that prior to just the last handful of years the portion of health records that had been digitized was nearly nil (up until about 5 years ago it was standard practice in most hospitals and private clinics to go digital-to-paper-to-digital). Essentially everyone's records were on paper, and all record transfers happened via fax (and still do, if a receiving physician is not inside the same hospital system on the same EMR as the referring physician).<p>source: work in hospital QI. I haven't worked in the VA, personally, so I am relating a lot of stuff second-hand, but the boundary between most hospitals' QI staff, the IHI, and the VA tends to be pretty porous, if you're in a healthcare capitol city - so I've heard a lot about the VA from co-workers that have worked there, or are currently engaged in ops research there.",1369792876

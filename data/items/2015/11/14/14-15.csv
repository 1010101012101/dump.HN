10565862,comment,10556637,10564955,0,0,orblivion,,,"> At the very least, this study tells us that the mindfulness meditation is a &#x27;more effective&#x27; placebo than the cream.<p>Which leads one to consider - what is a placebo anyway? It&#x27;s a mental state one puts oneself in that improves physically measurable symptoms. That seems indistinguishable to me from meditation. If you think about it, it&#x27;s kind of funny that skeptics like to dismiss impressive sounding treatments as being placebos. A placebo is a pretty impressive phenomenon!<p>If one can reliably create a <i>reliable</i>, powerful treatment that actually works (fixes what you&#x27;re targeting rather rather than symptoms, unless symptoms are what you&#x27;re targeting as in this case) by putting ones self into a mental state, that sounds like a win, even if it does meet the definition of a placebo.",1447513130

10565860,comment,10565324,10565324,0,0,pixelmonkey,,,"I recently watched Guy Steele&#x27;s &quot;Growing a Language&quot; talk. It&#x27;s very much related to jmoiron&#x27;s post here, and is worth a watch despite its age:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0</a><p>Steele&#x27;s commentary on &quot;Worse is Better&quot; seems to me to be a better representation of the original essay than the one expressed here about Go. Steele says:<p>&quot;The gist of [&#x27;Worse is Better&#x27;] is that the best way to get a language used by many persons is not to design and build &#x27;The Right Thing,&#x27; because that will take too long. In a race, a small language with warts will beat a well designed\nlanguage because users will not wait for the right thing; they will use the language that is quick and cheap, and put up with the warts. Once a small language fills a niche, it is hard to take its place.&quot;<p>In other words, the lesson of &#x27;Worse is Better&#x27; is that getting a &#x27;good enough&#x27; thing to market, and benefiting from the network effects of its widespread use, will always beat getting the &#x27;the really good&#x27; thing to market in the same category, because the cost of delay is the loss of (community) network effects. The illustrative example here is UNIX and C, but it can be easily cross-applied to more recent projects.<p>From that vantage point, Go isn&#x27;t a good example of &#x27;Worse is Better&#x27;. It occupies the same niche as C, but was delivered nearly 4 decades later. It seems to be a &quot;second edition of C&quot; designed with very explicit goals of correcting specific deficiencies of C as a systems programming language, but without the scope creep that characterizes many &quot;second systems&quot;.<p>Other languages -- like Python and Scala -- occupy completely different niches and have already achieved similar scale of network effects.<p>The rest of Guy Steele&#x27;s talk is worth watching, because his high-level point is that the languages that win aren&#x27;t the simpler ones, or the ones with the simplest/best design, but instead are the &quot;growable&quot; ones that get to market. For example, from Steele&#x27;s vantage point, the success of a programming ecosystem like Python&#x27;s would be evaluated as follows: it isn&#x27;t that it has the right level of simplicity/dynamism, or an appropriate programming paradigm. That Python made good decisions there helps, but they aren&#x27;t the key ingredients. Instead, its success is that it <i>shipped</i> in 1991, <i>evolved</i> over time to keep up with programming trends, that it has an awesome &#x27;import&#x27; statement, and that programmers feel they can &#x27;grow&#x27; the language through libraries (e.g. Django for web development, Pandas for data analysis) without waiting on the slow core language or stdlib evolutionary process.",1447513102

We should try to counter the radical ideology by allowing everyone to air their grievances in public without condemning or shouting down those we disagree with.

Many communities certainly aren&#x27;t very good at letting designers feel valued. Graphics is a perfect bike-shedding issue: everyone can have an opinion, can point to X examples that are &quot;better&quot; and many projects have difficulties to deal with that.<p>Graphics also profits very much from a consistent style, which a) requires someone to create such a style, b) for contributors to adhere to it. This makes small-scale contributions harder and less interesting, so it is harder for new designers to get started. Which again makes it harder to find people willing to do most of the work  (which would lead to more consistent styles).<p>Most projects have coding leads that police code contributions in style. For graphics, you&#x27;d need a graphics lead that can have a similar role for design and is backed enough that they can ignore some criticism. Which leads back to the issue of getting people started and into such a trusted position. It requires trust by the designer that their invested time will be worth it, and trust by the project that handing a lot of control to the designer will have a good result and that they&#x27;ll stay on board.<p>It seems to me that as a code contributor it is easier to &quot;rise through the ranks&quot; from small commits (and potentially staying there without issues). Splitting graphics work in small but interesting chunks seems way harder.<p>One game where it seems to have worked reasonably well is the transportation simulation Simutrans. There is a multitude of tilesets, but some of them work really well, despite being made by multiple people. Most of them are whimsical pixel-art style, which probably makes it easier to mix and match styles.<p>(Sorry if this comment is a bit all-over-the-place, but as I was writing new angles appeared)",1447511810

The Fire shall be their home&quot; (3:149-51)<p>&quot;Believers, do not follow the example of the infidels, who say of their brothers when they meet death abroad or in battle: ‘Had they stayed with us they would not have died, nor would they have been killed.&#x27; God will cause them to regret their words. . . . If you should die or be slain in the cause of God, God&#x27;s forgiveness and His mercy would surely be better than all the riches they amass&quot; (3:156).<p>&quot;God will not forgive those who serve other gods besides Him; but He will forgive whom He will for other sins. He that serves other gods besides God is guilty of a heinous sin. . . . Consider those to whom a portion of the Scriptures was given. They believe in idols and false gods and say of the infidels: ‘These are better guided than the believers&#x27;&quot; (4:50–51).<p>Yes there are also some quotes in the Quran that contradict these quotes (like all religious texts, it&#x27;s highly contradictory), and some people may be animated by charismatic individuals who distort the text, but Muslims who commit violence in the name of Allah need not believe anything more than the specific claims that the Quran makes to rationalize their violent actions.<p>The solution to this problem is like asking, &quot;What&#x27;s the solution to someone who still believes in Santa Claus at the age of 30?&quot;<p>If you encountered such a person, would you let them continue to believe in Santa Claus or would you empathetically attempt to communicate to that person that they need to deeply examine their beliefs and ensure they&#x27;re based in reality, based on evidence that can be readily observed.<p>But when most atheists and agnostics encounter a Muslim (or a Christian, or a Jew, or any religious person), they simply roll their eyes and shrug it off because they don&#x27;t &quot;want to get into it with them.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not saying you have to go around trying to prove everybody wrong all the time, that&#x27;s a recipe for ensuring everyone hates you. But religious beliefs are dangerous and they are the direct cause of violence -- not just Muslims of course, the Crusades are an obvious example of Christianity being the direct cause of violence.<p>The solution is to be empathetic, but not apologetic about the fact that their religious beliefs are not rooted in reality, and all beliefs should be.<p>TL;DR -- When you encounter a religious person, be empathetic, but not apologetic when communicating that their beliefs are based on a made up story rather than rooted in reality (as all beliefs should be).",1447511682

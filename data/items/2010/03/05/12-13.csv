1169288,comment,1169131,1169255,0,0,danh,,,"A linguist would probably say that Scandinavia already has a common language, and that Swedish, Norwegian and Danish are mere dialects of the same Scandinavian language. They are considered different languages mainly for political and historical reasons, but since they are mutually intelligible (with the possible exception of drunk Danes) ""Scandinavian"" is really a single language from a linguistic perspective.<p>Icelandic is a different story, of course. Thankfully, though, the Icelandic speak English rather well...",1267793975

For good professors, >100% of their salary is paid for by grants they bring in, not tuition. The tuition goes to pay for other things, like the school's bureaucracy, athletic facilities, extracurricular activities, gardening, janitorial staff, and subsidizing the humanities, all of which don't have much to do with developing science curricula.",1267793943

1169260,comment,1169227,1169227,0,0,DougWebb,,,"Some developer has clearly mis-understood the 'stateless' part of HTTP. The protocol is stateless, but the resources are NOT stateless. You don't have to and shouldn't send all of the information your service needs through the protocol; all you need to send is sufficient information to fully identify the resource you're working with. In this case, that would be the customer id number, which is your key into a database that has the real customer information.<p>Oh, and DON'T STORE UNENCRYPTED CC NUMBERS, AND NEVER STORE THE SECURITY CODE. That should be so obvious. If I were building a system like this, and I was required to store the CC number at all (which I'd prefer not too but many retailers do it) I'd encrypt it using the security code, and I'd modify my http logs to filter those codes out of the log. That way I couldn't decrypt the CC number without asking for the code, and I'd never have the code stored anyplace on my system.",1267792370

As a director of two companies I have found that they are helpful beyond expectations.  The people I deal with are there to ensure that everything is legal and above board, they are not there to make you pay as much as possible.  More than once I've had HMRC make suggestions that would reduce what I pay, and their advice is free.<p>Sadly, youa re dealing with the IRS, and I have no idea if they are the same.  The impression one gets from outside the USA is that you must pay professionals for their advice and assistance in dealing with Government agencies, rather than dealing with the agencies themselves.<p>IANAL, and in particular I have no direct experience f taxation issues in the USA, but my advice would be to find an accountant in the USA who is willing to discuss this will you via email.

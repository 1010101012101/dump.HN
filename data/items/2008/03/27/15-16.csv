When a person  (indeed, even a specialist) claims special insight (including critical insight) of a well-examined problem he is almost always wrong. The physicist John Baez not infrequently encounters cranks who believe they've found errors in relativity theory or quantum mechanics. He has developed a scale for rating cranks:<p><a href=""http://groups.google.ca/group/sci.physics/msg/5312a801e0785e66?hl=en&#38"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.ca/group/sci.physics/msg/5312a801e0785e...</a>;<p>The OP is wrong in so many ways that it renders his article meaningless. And others have pointed out possible errors (although doing so one must interpret the OP's intentions, a risky endeavor indeed), though certainly not to exhaustion. To add a single specific item of criticism to the fray would only provide yet another handle for the OP  or other misled persons to grasp and extend the discussion uselessly.<p>The human mind can create ideas, phrases, and analogies some of which, upon further examination, are devoid of meaning. Dreaming is an extreme instance wherein most of the ideas later make no sense. However the same thing can happen while fully conscious and is part of the normal creative process.<p>Mathematics  and logic are tools we use for separating empty ideas from useful and meaningful ones. Unfortunately there is no Royal Road to mathematics or logic, nor to relational databases:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Road"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Road</a><p>I have neither the time, nor the inclination, much less the rhetorical skill to enlighten the OP or this group as to the vagaries of databases.<p>Nor do I view this as a ""rhetorical"" discussion: rhetoric is concerned with swaying the populace to your side of the argument whether you are correct or not. I am concerned about what is correct rather than what is popular.<p>I do not doubt the enthusiasm (or frustration) of the OP, however his complaints are poorly-stated, unclear and orginate from an incomplete understanding of logic and relational databases. Many similar complaints have been stated before (often much more clearly and in a form arguable) in more appropriate venues (e.g., Google for ""relational vs OOP group:comp.*""), where they have been thrashed about thoroughly by better, and worse, men than me.<p>It is one thing to register frustration. But it is another to casually question ideas that have withstood the test of time and cast that questioning as serious.<p>To show that frustration in the development of databases is nothing new see William Kent's ""Data and Reality"":<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Data-Reality-William-Kent/dp/1585009709"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Data-Reality-William-Kent/dp/158500970...</a>",1206633285

147806,comment,147710,147791,0,0,david927,,,"I'm channeling a pharmacist friend here.  Either a pill has no effect (such as Vitamin-C) and just gives you expensive urine, or it has an effect.  And if it has an effect, it has a side effect(s).  No pharmacist in the world knows what would happen if you mix that many pills, whatever they are, and so, unless most of them are herbal non-drugs, he's taking a big chance, which is exactly what he's trying to avoid.  Thus the irony.",1206632883

I think the best advice is to consult an immigration lawyer. Not only because they know about the law (which I find is actually pretty hit and miss) but having a letter from a lawyer included in your application gives you a little more legitimacy.",1206632592

In his talk to the Science Mission Directorate he said that the management issues were about cost control and that he did not see a way for him to do what needs to be done. He didn't go into details.

The clamshell design provides a proper keyboard with proper tactile feedback, a palm rest and an easily adjustable display. It's stable sitting on a lap, and closes up to protect the screen and keyboard from damage, or simply getting dirty.<p>I'll be using said laptop to write code in a variant of a programming language invented in 1958 using a variant of an editor invented in the '70s. My car will still have a steering wheel and be rear wheel drive. Some things just work until a truly disruptive technology comes along and completely changes the game. The clamshell laptop is one of those things, and I don't see anything truly disruptive in this article.",1206631200

147792,comment,147751,147751,0,0,brk,,,"Interesting, but I think he's way too late to that party.<p>These short, generic domain names (like perfume.com) had some value 10 years ago, when Internet search was still much more of a chaotic crapshoot.<p>Today, you could practically run a thriving ecommerce site from just a static IP if you spent a little bit of time on SEO.  People go to google, type in ""perfume"" or ""buy perfume"" and go off to either the text-ad sites, or the top organic results.<p>Users have been trained on the idea that ""domain guessing"" is hopeless, and more than likely to land you on a pr0n site or ad site (like those domains are currently configured).<p>Also, for many of these e-commerce related sites, there is a large percentage of people who are looking to buy perfume+something else.  If your site is so tightly optimized around 1 product class, I think you'll lose a lot of business to people who want to buy 3 products from 1 vendor, not 3 products from 3 vendors.<p>IMO, the majority of these domain squatters have so thoroughly skewed or ruined how people find products of interest that they have no hope of suddenly turning things around by turning these domains into what they should have done from the beginning.",1206630936

Without getting too much into it, suffice to say that robots will be forced to subscribe to the same survival-of-the-fittest constraints that humans have. When you observe the human species, it might seem strange that there are so many people who enjoy rap music and nascar, and so few who enjoy calculating derivatives in their heads. But nature (read: survival of the fittest) has only portioned out a comparatively small number of superintelligent people in the world, for a reason. It will presumably do the same for robots.<p>That is, when robots are manufacturing themselves, a moderately intelligent ""thug"" robot, or ""drone"" robot, or ""worker"" robot, or ""leech"" robot will have certain advantages over a ""sit and design better competitors for myself"" robot.",1206630259

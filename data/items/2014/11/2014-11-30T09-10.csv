Wandering from yoga classes to self-improvement new-agey seminars and paying the top dollar for the privilege.<p>Picking and choosing from a technique here and a convenient piece of philosophy there doesn&#x27;t sound like solid approach to spiritual life.<p>Treating your soul like cart in a convenience store where you just throw-in whatever looks good is plain naive, immature and  wrong. Besides, Yoga, buddhism fashion and other New Agey fashions are so passe: they peaked in 80s/90s. Are there still people treating this seriously?<p>I&#x27;m sorry but this is the lowest form of spirituality I can imagine.

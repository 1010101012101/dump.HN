Flexibility does usually have a cost, in software and in physical systems, and Firefox definitely goes to the extreme on flexibility. I'm about 50/50 on whether the trade is worth it, and I waffle between Chrome and Firefox as my primary browser.<p>Firebug and AdBlock Plus are both quite demanding plugins, having to analyze and manipulate the DOM so often and in so many ways.

Assuming for a moment that professional scientists make a course correction and come out with some sort of ethical guidelines about social activism, public standards of proof, open data, and letting some sunlight in the publishing process? These things are going to take a long time, probably several years. All the while there will be little spikes in the story here or there. The main theme, however, may take a decade or more to play out.<p>That means that the story isn't going away as a serious science (by science I mean the practice-of-science) story. It's just going to simmer.<p>I happen to agree that sometimes this particular story leads to long threads of he-said, she-said, but at the same time I think it's a legitimate story about something we're all somewhat interested in.  You could make the same observation about functional programming, or Apple products -- lots of things tend towards pointless conversation. Lots of things appear on TV news.<p>It's just a guideline.<p>And for the record I don't think long threads are necessarily a bad thing.

One argument often made is that censorship as necessary to keep people in order, and particularly necessary in China due to the population.  The Western doctrine of freedom of speech, as the argument goes, has little applicability in a country with over 4 times the population.<p>Revolts and rebellions are also often seen in a much more negative light in China.  Here in the west, they have resulted in many very positive changes, and are widely-regarded as being sometimes necessary to growth, and a way to keep the government in check.<p>Many of the Chinese I've met are also fiercely patriotic.  ""Why should our country cave into demands of a foreign company?""<p>Obviously, I'm generalizing here, and from a small sample size too.  This is just my personal experience from the people I met and spent time with there, and opinions held by more highly-educated people often did not follow this trend and tended to be more critical of the government.<p>Note that this is a regurgitation of some common arguments I heard- absolutely not my personal view.<p>But they do have one point: Why do we care so much about Chinese censorship, as long as it is only affecting people within China?",1264362380

It isn't an independent analysis to take two different approaches to information-gathering and see who has the most accurate data when compared to the data gathered by one of the approaches.<p>The question isn't whether Compete or Quantcast or Comscore is closest to the raw server data. The question is whether the raw server data can be used to accurately judge the number of people who visit a website. If so, Comscore's data are most likely irrelevant because they are approaching the problem in a completely different way.",1264360489

This shouldn't be too difficult, but you are likely to have a high area overhead for this.\n2) Getting the place and router to behave as you would expect it to. It depends if the router uses the clock to propagate it's information, although I expect it would NOT.<p>Getting the asynchronous IP core into a SoC system is not that difficult. You'll have to convert synchronous signals to asynchronous signals and vise versa, but once you figure that out (it's actually very simple) you can plug in the asynchronous core anywhere.<p>I used dual rail QDI in my circuit design, with a mix of four phase handshakes and two phase handshakes, depending on the application.<p>Fault-tolerant logic is definitely feasible - I worked on this for one project! The technique is patented by Achronix, but it definitely is almost bullet proof and only requires an area overhead similar to a voting schema.",1264359891

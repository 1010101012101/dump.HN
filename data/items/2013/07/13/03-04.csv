6036617,comment,6034166,6034506,1,0,nadaviv,,,"What about the script that they inject to every page you ever visit? Its completely useless - it contains an empty script and does nothing at all. What reason would they have to add this?<p>That simple empty script allows them, at any point in the future, to remotely inject scripts that&#x27;ll have full permissions over any website you visit, without having to push an extension update or have it as part of their core extension code.<p>They can also choose to send it to specific individuals, or only for specific websites (their script URL gets the visited page as an query string argument), making something like this extremely difficult to detect.<p>And of course, this could also be abused by someone who hacks their servers. He could, for example, inject a script that sends the user/password whenever you login to a bank or paypal.<p>Having remote code execute on every page you ever visit is either extremely stupid or an extremely smart way to spy on people without being detected. When the code is part of the extension itself and not remote it: 1) has to be signed (making abuse harder for a malicious hacker) and 2) can be more easily audited, as all users of the extension would get the &quot;spying code&quot; (making abuse harder for a malicious company)<p>edit: wording",1373687881
6036616,comment,6035005,6035005,2,0,chiph,,,"I had a set of Bose 901 speakers in the 1980s.  They were a really innovative design, and certainly not &quot;wife-friendly&quot; with their requirement that the wall behind them be a certain size and distance away.<p>It had 8 smaller drivers facing towards the wall, angled to reflect off it and produce a more ambient sound. And one driver facing towards the listener to provide the direct sound needed for vocals.  The speakers (heavy, heavy speakers, btw) had an earlier version of their waveguide technology, which channeled the back pressure of all the small drivers and combined them to provide the bass that a larger driver would have produced.<p>In order to correct some of the bad behavior of the small drivers & enclosure, there was an external electronics box that you inserted between your preamp and amp, or in a tape loop if you had a receiver (it had pass-thru capability) to get the speakers to sound right.  Once DSPs became affordable, they changed over to them, instead of the analog components the series of 901 that I had used.<p>I think I paid $1300 at the military exchange for the pair, and the (essentially required) Bose stands were another $200 or so.  Which was a lot of money at the time (CD players were still $500).  But I had bragging rights until I got written-up by playing them too loudly.  The 901s definitely preferred a high-current amp -- I used a Hafler 200 watt MOSFET amp. A Sony integrated-circuit based receiver went into shutdown trying to drive them.",1373687881
6036615,comment,6035005,6036225,7,0,lambda,,,"> Anything half the price will outperform what Bose has to offer.<p>So, if &quot;anything half the price&quot; is supposed to outperform Bose, would you be willing to point out something half the price of an equivalent Bose product and show me some kind of unbiased test that demonstrates it?<p>I feel like I hear this kind of sentiment a lot, but I almost never see any evidence to back it up.<p>Bose doesn&#x27;t cater to the high-end audiophile market. They don&#x27;t sell big, bulky, expensive equipment that audiophiles go for. Instead, they sell small stuff that&#x27;s expensive for it&#x27;s size but cheap compared to audiophile equipment. And I think that it it does pretty well for its size and price. Sure, you can get better sound quality out of bigger, bulkier, more expensive equipment. And you can get reasonable audio quality out of other small, cheaper gear. But I&#x27;m wondering if you can get gear that beats it in every way; smaller, cheaper, and better?<p>I have never done any kind of blinded experiments, or measurements of frequency responses, or other such scientific comparisons, so I can&#x27;t say for sure. And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking if you know better. Is there something out there, at a similar size and price point, that is better than what Bose offers? Do you have good evidence for this?",1373687871

6036603,comment,6036385,6036385,16,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Wow.<p>1) Good for Valve. I think this is the beginning of an already awesome company evolving even further.<p>2) Jeri Ellsworth (fired valve employee) was right. Some of the older Valve employees really have been holding the company back in terms of culture and new hires. This seems to be Valve&#x27;s response by fixing itself and focusing on recruiting new younger staff. The problem with being an awesome place to work is that employees don&#x27;t leave even when they should. They might in turn refuse to let younger employees in out of fear that they&#x27;ll be replaced. So slowly it destroys the natural cycle of replacement of old ideas with fresh new ones. It might not be set up as a recruitment platform but it sure can be used like one to Valve&#x27;s advantage. They can support kids who want to get into the industry and at the same time snap up the best of the best before other companies do.<p>3) Also, Valve hires only the most experienced who can self manage themselves. This has allowed them to do a lot with only 300 or so people but expanding seems to be slow. Other companies hire juniors, work them hard, pay them below market wages, and can expand faster and create more IP. If Valve wants to launch more IP or expand they&#x27;re going to have to change their ways. And it seems they&#x27;ve come to terms with that.",1373687492

6036596,comment,6033135,6034172,1,0,btilly,,,"Here is an explanation that I read in a book of Steve McConnell&#x27;s a decade ago.<p>Certain types of tasks (eg building a bridge) require an engineer to sign off on the work.  And the engineer is personally liable should the design of the bridge prove faulty.  An engineer is a person whose license allows them to make those representations and have it be accepted.<p>Most software developers lack that license, and cannot legally sign off on designs.  And as an industry we don&#x27;t value software development&#x27;s expertise as a final say on what does or does not fly.  The consequence is chronic security problems, nonfunctional software, privacy specifications, etc, etc, etc.<p>As a society, we are not OK with bridges falling down.  But apparently we are OK with having software projects routinely overrun budgets by 100+% and still fail to deliver required functionality.<p>Steve McConnell makes the case in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Software-Development-Schedules-Successful/dp/0321193679/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1373686659&sr=1-5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Software-Development-Sche...</a> that if a true software engineering profession was recognized - not just software developers being called software developers but actual engineering certifications in the field of software development - we could begin fixing this.  I don&#x27;t think it will happen, nor am I totally supportive of that approach - but he makes a case worth reading.",1373687041

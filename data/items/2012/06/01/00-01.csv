4051325,comment,4050988,4051262,21,0,haberman,,,"Googler here (though not a lawyer and I don't speak for the company).  I agree that the OP's assessment that you quoted is incorrect in general, for the reasons you mentioned.  The Google-internal process that OP is alluding to allows an employee to seek positive assurance from Google that the company will not attempt to claim ownership over the project.  It's a way to get agreement up-front that both parties agree the project is unrelated to the business.  You don't give up any rights by not going through the process, but you might discover later that Google believes the work is related to the business, and believes that it owns the IP.<p>However, there is another completely separate process that allows you to open-source your code while having Google retain copyright.  It's much easier to get through (turnaround is just a few days) and lets you release the code under a permissive license like BSD or Apache2.  I write a lot of open-source code on the side, and I've used this process to get approval for all of it.  It makes no difference to me whether Google technically owns the copyright.<p>I would add that Google's open-source policies are a huge plus in my book.  It's a night-and-day difference from Amazon where I used to work.  Trying to get anything released as open-source at Amazon was like pulling teeth.",1338512382

Their skills are generic business & have no coding / technical background.""<p>to read:<p>""The simple answer is: Those who want a job, dont have the tech degrees and years of techexperiencethat companies want. Its simple supply & demand.""<p>Anyone can learn how to code. Anyone can learn how to code well. The problem is learning technically skills would help you do a new job, but they wouldn't help you get one. Minimum requirements include tech degrees and years of technicalexperiencein the field. Having project work helps, but if you can't meet the minimum requirements on experience and degrees, then it doesn't matter what your technical skills actually are. There are a small handful of companies that make an exception to this tradition, but as it turns out I would say they make up less than .01% of employers (of course this is a ballpark estimate, based on my personalexperience, but I would invite anyone to pick out major employer that fits this category and is actively hiring). <p>I also agree with michaelochurch regarding technical silos and just bad employer expectations in general.",1338512343

4051317,comment,4050410,4051069,3,0,dkersten,,,"<i>Darn, and here I thought open source projects were supposed to be free.</i><p>Well, there's two core parts to open source and free software and neither have much to do with not having to pay for it (though that often is the case). First, there's the availability of source code and second is <i>free as in freedom, not as in beer</i>. But we don't yet know what license this will be released under, so we don't know what rights or restrictions may apply. Presumably, by the sounds of the text about Light Table being open source, it will be a standard Free and Open source license (GPL seems most likely to me) and he also says that the paid license will probably apply to prebuilt packaged releases, so if you don't mind building everything yourself, you may well get it for free after all.<p><i>I think the pay what you want model would be appropriate</i><p>I agree, for Free & Open Source Software, pay what you want seems like a very suitable model.",1338512171

Assuming you missed my point, let me try to elaborate (if not, please excuse my misunderstanding):<p>I'm not refuting that the USSR would have disassembled, examined, and returned the capsule. I'm pointing out that the US government during the Cold War would have considered that outcome to be a threat to national security. That's what I meant by my statement, ""That's pretty bad when considered from the mentality that was prevalent during the Cold War.""<p>From your link: ""This was the first time that Western experts were able to get a close look at the aircraft, and it revealed many secrets and surprises. His defection caused a lot of damage to the Soviet Union Air Force."" My point was that if the Soviet Union got a hold of one of the USA's space capsules, the outcome for the USA would have been the same that it was for the USSR in the article you linked to.<p>As I mentioned in one of my other comments in this thread, the space race was part of the larger arms race between the USA and the USSR during the Cold War [1].

I agree with everything you've said: the USSR wouldn't have started a war if the capsule splashed down in their waters, and they would have disassembled and returned the capsule. I'm trying to point out the (perceived at the time) seriousness of the USSR disassembling the capsule. I should have attached my original comment further up the ancestor chain where people were debating how interested the USSR would have been in intercepting the capsule.",1338512112

But sometimes the hard parts of the problem are not in the structure of runtime data. Classic imperative and structured programming focused on the format of input data as the driver for code architecture, and that is the right way to design processes. Performance-oriented code needs to pay attention to data access more than to data structure or even to operations.<p>Doing only OOP takes your attention away from those issues, and thus limits your design.

Tim Schafer, founder of, and designer at, Double Fine, is celebrated at his craft, and Psychonauts is an excellent example of why. And it's written by Schafer and Erik Wolpaw, who wrote Portal.<p>In his games, and especially Psychonauts, Schafer is known for creating a beautiful world and characters for the player. In Psychonauts you play Raz, a young child of circus performers who (instead of running away from his boring life to join the circus) runs away from the circus to attend summer camp! Of course, it can't be normal; it's a summer camp for those with mental abilities, training to join a super-powered CIA style organization. You hone your psychic abilities as you go through levels that take place in the minds of characters. The characters, though fun, start off warm and familiar: The militant trainer, the cool, calm, and perfectly restrained agent, and the hippie-dippy counselor who just wants to have a good time, maaan. There's even a kooky old man who may be more than he thinks... But then it gets amazing.<p>Schafer is well known for his writing, and for me it's his ability to perfectly marry together game concepts and game content that make him great. In Mario you collect coins and in Sonic you collect rings, both existing in story only to their own end. In Psychonauts you traverse the minds of other characters, collecting mental fragments, the doodlings of an inner child. You can also find memories locked away in vaults, sometimes hidden behind barriers (mental blocks), or behind cobwebs. (Talk about not wanting to deal with things!) It's through collecting these memories that we actually get a better picture of the people whose minds we're traversing.<p>The game is not perfect. There are issues with a level or two. Well, one anyway. Overall, it's reach probably exceeds it's grasp, but that's okay. It manages to reach pretty damn far. And how it gets there is far better than most games.",1338510949

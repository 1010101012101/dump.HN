7925764,comment,7925233,7925589,1,0,AJ007,,,"Are America&#x27;s poorest better off because of technology, or better off because of America&#x27;s dominance over the rest of the world&#x27;s resources?<p>My suspicion is that as the developing world becomes more educated, the poor and middle class in the US will look poorer. Some of this might be an actual loss in standard of living as the share of global resources the US can consume drops. This change, induced by technology (mass education) is going to be a bigger issue for the developed world sooner than computers-taking-away-jobs will be.<p>Presumably more educated people are less likely to give away their resources for cheap (or in corrupt countries for free), less likely to work 16 hours a day in a factory, to accept mass pollution as a by product of manufacturing, etc. That is just an assumption, it could be wrong and education will have no impact on these things.<p>The psychological aspect -- comparatively, might have more to do with whether an individual thinks their condition is improving as opposed to the distance between individuals.<p>If you generally believe what Ray Kurzweil predicts, none of this will really matter in 2100 as we could be well in to the post-human era. Humans, in their natural form, could very well be relics in a zoo.",1403377163

However a lot of the more advanced flight control systems (even on hobbyist drones) will have a failsafe that causes it to return to home or similar in the case of loss of radio contact. I suppose even in that situation you could use a GPS jammer to stop that from happening. Of course this would all be highly illegal.",1403377149

7925758,comment,7924836,7925297,2,0,jsudhams,,,"Why? I am from India and not a full time developer but mostly system admin/solutions designer/architect (Linux, Windows and networking). I can also code, while my code may not be an elegant as 10+ years experienced in the c , erlang or haskell and may not use clojure, mvc or other frameworks because i don&#x27;t know how to use them and for smaller projects most of boiler plate code is reusable. (Pls note I don&#x27;t disagree framework usage for large projects but if the software you develop is not going to have more than 100 concurrent connections then I don&#x27;t see the need for breakthrough coding and rather straight for python, c# or vb.net will do). At the same time for desktop , server sizing , engineering and setting up an IT shop the right way , I can tell you that i am as competent or better than any westerner. yep i may have my own reasons to believe MS stack or Linux stack is good enough certain workloads depending on situation but i can tell you that i can manage complex enough systems with very little time including the understanding process and will come up with improvements with if few weeks. so please do not generalize. Half of corporate america software is maintained by Indians and i can tell you that before Indians came to outsourcing the code or maintenance for the same was not that great. The IT mess(with outsourcing) is not because of Indians or westerners but mostly due to way you see and use Indians, give them chance to prove and I am sure you will be surprised what a well coordinated equal opportunity team can do. Please note that we don&#x27;t work the same way as you do and for us to speak up it requires lot of training and comfort with the party we deal, also please note that the competition for us is not just westerners but also with in.

7925748,comment,7925430,7925430,3,0,rdtsc,,,"I think with increased use of drones both for attack and surveillance there would also an increase in anti-drone technology.<p>Is there any easy way to detect and fight drones? Lasers? Jammers? Iran presumably jammed the drone they captured. Can that be done with a transmitter one can build at home?<p>Drones will be used more and more by law enforcement agencies, and I think eventually they will come with some (at least at first) non-lethal weapons -- flash grenades, rubber bullets, tazers, spikes for your car tires. Ran the red light? -- better watch out, a drone will be dropping tire spikes soon in front of your car.<p>In that respect I bet counter-drone technology will become interesting. You know harming a helicopter with real police officers or even harming a K-9 officer is a serious offense. Attempted murder, very threatening. Disabling a flying camera hovering over your head is not there yet. So there is less threat of a harsh punishment. Of course laws will catch up and there will probably be special provisions and penalties for disabling or tampering with drones that go beyond run of the mill vandalism.",1403376748

7925738,comment,7922028,7925598,1,0,majika,,,"> Several highly lucrative drugs came from bio research conducted in the rainforest.<p>That research was probably conducted in rainforests protected as a national park, right? At least, I highly doubt that the pharmaceutical companies actually acquired the land before conducting research, or that they would bother buying entire rainforests (to protect the ecosystem) if there wasn&#x27;t a state to protect them.<p>An anarcho-capitalist may suggest that the pharmaceutical companies could create a fund with other people who care about preserving the rainforests, to acquire and protect the rainforests. But then, that fund would have to raise as much money as the potential profit to be made by cutting it all down - which is terribly perverted, I think. Still, such a fund would unlikely be universal enough to protect <i>all</i> rainforests and other important ecological centers. The point stands that whatever land a logging company acquires, it will want to destroy.<p>Logging is far too prevalent as it is - with all the regulation and restrictions imposed on it by modern states. I&#x27;m not sure how the argument could be made that logging would be <i>less</i> prevalent if there weren&#x27;t any states to stop it.<p>> an alternative would be to argue that all resources in public domain actually belong to everyone, rather than no one<p>This is a nice idea in theory (and is semi-applicable in anarcho-communism too), but it can&#x27;t realistically be determined what to share (e.g. these bison were on <i>my</i> property), how to enforce it (e.g. knowing who&#x27;s harvesting what), or how to handle it (e.g. how to allocate compensation for killing a whale).<p>I&#x27;m not sure why we have to go through these economic gymnastics just to avoid the concept of having an association of democratic governments banning whaling or deforesting. What&#x27;s so wrong with that?<p>> the state I grew up in, IL, and how incredibly, unflinchingly, and stunningly corrupt that state, and more specifically, the city of Chicago is<p>I have connections to Chicago, and can relate :-)<p>In my ideal world, Chicago would be broken up into governments even smaller than the City of Chicago today, which spans about 15km x 40km it seems.<p>I think many city councils are &quot;optimized&quot; for administration, and not for representation. If each of these small states were completely autonomous, and had to legislate their entire body of law, the citizens would care more, and they would develop more representative and accountable voting systems and institutions, due to the extent of the government&#x27;s responsibilities.<p>Also, to make the point again, if a certain state is known to be corrupt, and does nothing to address it, it will probably lose business and residents to nearby states that aren&#x27;t. Similarly, neighboring states would have an interest in supporting one another, and would try to discourage corruption (e.g. avoiding companies that bribe officials elsewhere).<p>The key point for smaller states, in my opinion, is that their constituents <i>care</i>. I feel like people are more apathetic in larger states, because they have less power individually, and their responsibility to keep their government accountable is further absolved. When you get people to care, and give them power collectively, everything else follows.",1403376487
7925737,comment,7925233,7925474,10,0,legutierr,,,"To echo what asgard1024 wrote: inequality is a problem if you are concerned with your own ability to make decisions for yourself.  We see that today in our political system: money buys access, and concentrated wealth breeds concentrated power.<p>Envy and social status are not the primary reasons people fear inequality; instead, it is the fear that someone else has control over your destiny, and you are powerless to stop it.  And this is what we see every day, even as entrepreneurs--regulatory capture by entrenched interests (and government corruption generally) prevents innovation and real competition, keeping too much wealth in the undeserving hands of those who have rigged the game in their own favor.<p>Furthermore, it is also quite possible that levels of inequality that we are seeing in the United States drag down economic growth, at least to the point that the material status of the poor is decreasing in absolute, objective terms.  This makes perfect sense when you consider how important individual freedom is for broad economic growth--if economic inequality makes people less able to pursue their own objectives and best interests, all but the rich and politically connected will find themselves unable to contribute the best of themselves to society and to the markets.<p>It&#x27;s entirely conjecture to attempt to assert that high levels of inequality are an <i>inevitable</i> result of sustained economic growth, and that high levels of inequality are necessary to sustain growth.  However, it makes it <i>very</i> easy to hold conservative views in opposition to redistributive policies if you also believe that redistributive policies hurt growth--even when there is no actual evidence backing that belief.<p>Again, there is no evidence that redistributive policies <i>as such</i> harm growth.  However, there may be evidence of a &quot;goldilocks zone&quot;, an ideal level of inequality that spurs growth most effectively--where the opposite extremes of communism and the modern &quot;gilded age&quot;--and their well-documented drawbacks--are both avoided.  To me this seems like common sense.",1403376464

Today, many unskilled people stand to <i>lose</i> money by getting a job, because the value of their labor is so low that the loss of benefits they&#x27;d trigger by becoming employed would actually be more significant than the amount of money they&#x27;d make from any job for which they can actually qualify.<p>This is a stupid state of affairs, because: (1) it wastes the potential labor of such people (which is, after all, generally worth <i>something</i>); (2) it robs them of the psychological benefits of being gainfully employed; and (3) it disincentivizes them from gaining the practice in work and thereby developing the skills that would allow them to get better jobs in the future.<p>BI fixes these problems by making sure that everyone, even at the bottom, sees positive economic return for their labor.<p>From a social dynamics standpoint, I suspect that over the long run, this feature is probably even more valuable than the &quot;keep you from starving&quot; features of BI.",1403376233

7925714,comment,7924836,7924836,7,0,MortenK,,,"The broader topic for this is &quot;outsourcing&quot;. When work is done 90/100% remote, to countries far away, it&#x27;s commonly referred to as &quot;offshore outsourcing&quot;. It&#x27;s a whole separate production discipline, with unique challenges all the way from staffing to day-to-day management.<p>Many business people and entrepreneurs try offshore outsourcing a couple of times, lured in by the seemingly low prices. They then fail and declare outsourcing as a non-viable solution for product development.<p>It can and does work, but it requires experience.<p>So while you are looking for specific tips for searching for developers, you need to be aware that the work doesn&#x27;t end there - there&#x27;s a lot more to it.<p>To get specific though:<p>1) Always create a private job and invite developers yourself. If not, you&#x27;ll be spammed with offers from the bottom of the barrel.<p>2) Filter for location first. If it&#x27;s your first time with outsourcing, you are best off with developers from countries that are as close as possible to your own culture. For Western Europe, a good bet is Eastern Europe and Western Russia. In the US, you&#x27;re probably better of with certain south American countries like Argentina and Chile due to the lower time difference.<p>3) Look for developers that has had long contracts (500+ hours) with 5 star feedback. You can&#x27;t base much off small contracts with 5 star feedback.<p>4) Apply same screening techniques as you would, were you hiring locally: Does the guy have an impressive portfolio, CS education, does he have some side projects / Github profile etc, how many years of experience and so on. Don&#x27;t put too much stock in any single point: There is for example plenty of extremely competent people, who do not have a degree, who do not give a shit about maintaining a Stackoverflow or Github profile and so on.<p>5) Once you&#x27;ve screened them, invite them to the job listing. Get them on skype, either talk or chat. They need at least a very good written English, if it&#x27;s your first try with outsourcing. Ask for code samples and review them.<p>6) If not &quot;just&quot; front-end coding: Have a good, thorough specification ready, for the developers to read. Sometimes they will want payment just to read the spec, sometimes they&#x27;ll do it for free. Either way, it doesn&#x27;t show much about their competence.<p>7) Ask them to deliver a written deliverable of something reasonably advanced. Stuff like a suggested database model, or a very high-level overview of a proposed architecture for whatever it is you are building. This will usually be paid work, between 4 and 8 hours. The purpose is not to get the absolute right db model or architecture - it&#x27;s to see a written deliverable from the developer. This is invaluable, since it requires real skill, thinking and communication abilities, while still being relatively cheap. If they cannot deliver this, they are not good enough. An exception is if you are looking for some front-end guy, then just get a sample of their markup.<p>8) Monitor their work closely in the first period of time (first 2-3 weeks is usually enough).<p>9) Be ready for disappointments. Even with all the above work, you will still not hit a good guy every time.<p>10) If all else fails, drop me a line, I&#x27;ll be happy to assist :-)",1403376179

You cannot really purchase Education, you just pay for the opportunity to be part of that process. In this sense, your self at the time of admission is the raw material, your actualized self at the time of graduation is the final product, while the body of students can be considered the total inventory of product in process.<p>Second, every process of self actualization is <i>Hard</i> with capital H. It requires lots of work, and can be stressful (or even painful) at times. There are no shortcuts. It requires diligence to push through all that work, and perseverance in times when you feel like crap because it seems that you are never going to make it. Professors are guides and mentors, but ultimately you educate yourself. And because of this, no outcomes can be guaranteed.<p>Traditionally, Universities were modeled after medieval guilds. Professors, as guild masters before them, accepted candidates and teach them the art of the guild. They did not do so because they were not nice guys, but for a profit motive (Universities nowadays directly in the fees they charge, Guilds in the past indirectly through apprentices&#x27; free labor).<p>If the apprentice/student persevered for a fixed number of years, they received the social recognition of being competent in the art of the guild. In the Guild, apprentices became journey-man which gave them the right to practice their art in the territory controlled by the Guild and to receive a salary for it. In University, the undergraduate is considered a knowledgeable person in their major and (though we like to pretend that higher education is not job training) eligible for jobs that require specialized qualifications. In neither case does this imply that the student is now considered equals with the teacher.<p>For the undergraduate/journeyman to be considered equals with their professor/master, they have to pursue more self directed, advanced education for an undefined number of years. In both cases, the candidate must present a proof of competence in the art beyond what is expected from mere practitioners: For the journeyman it&#x27;s called &quot;master piece&quot;, for the graduate student &quot;PhD thesis&quot;. This proof is presented to a group of masters including but not limited to your mentor, and they measure, debate and maybe approve it. If that last is the case, you are considered now to be a peer of them.<p>None of this fact seem to be common knowledge among undergraduate students, and Universities make no effort to disabuse them of their ignorance. Instead, they are now following a service industry model where every customer receives a standardized, repeatable service, and customer satisfaction is paramount. Until the day that we invent machines such as those in the first &quot;Matrix&quot; movie - where specific information and skills can be downloaded to your brain by direct manipulation of your neuronal patterns using electromagnetic impulses inside your skull - this model will only mess up with the older model of apprentice/master transfer of knowledge through the hard but proven self actualization process.",1403374151

I feel sick typing this...<p>Not necessarily. Several highly lucrative drugs came from bio research conducted in the rainforest. The pharmaceutical industry is far more profitable than the logging industry. Of course, it takes a significant foresight to do research in the rain forest, rather than cut it down for timber.<p>> Another major example of markets encouraging overharvesting is when the harvesting occurs on land/water that no one owns (or can reasonably own). Then, the harvesters have no regard for the replenishment of the resource; they just want to make money.<p>This is true if you follow the first capture rule of ownership for resources located in public domain (not owned by anyone in particular due to their nature). However, an alternative would be to argue that all resources in public domain actually belong to everyone, rather than no one. So, if you were to capture a whale in the ocean, you would actually be violating the rights of every other person on the planet to that whale. Thus, you would be obliged to compensate everyone on the planet for the fair market value (minus the cost of capture) of that whale. This means, the best you could do is brake even on your whaling activity. All of the sudden, it&#x27;s no longer such an attractive economic activity.<p>> Sure, a state&#x27;s governing may not please everyone - but if everyone is within walking and living distance, the society would be more able to resolve its differences, or come to a compromise. Thanks to this quality, I think smaller states could function with requiring more than the majority in parliament to pass legislation: e.g. 66% or 75%. Either way, at worst, you can move to a nearby state that aligns more with your beliefs. In this way, &quot;governing&quot; would become a market for ideas that work.<p>I was actually just writing how much I agree with you, and how in the past I thought that the states in US should have a lot more power, and the Federal government should have a lot less. But than I remembered the state I grew up in, IL, and how incredibly, unflinchingly, and stunningly corrupt that state, and more specifically, the city of Chicago is. Given that example, I wonder if small governments can really avoid being corrupt. That&#x27;s of course not to say that large governments aren&#x27;t crazy corrupt as well.",1403373608

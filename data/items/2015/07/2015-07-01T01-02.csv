9809624,comment,9804533,9805198,0,0,nolanl,,,"I still have a soft spot for WebSQL over IndexedDB - way easier to work with, incredibly powerful, brought the speed and reliability of SQLite. However, WebSQL only ever managed to have one implementation (Chrome and Safari shared WebKit at the time), and the other vendors besides Opera didn&#x27;t want to touch it. So it&#x27;s long since time to accept that it&#x27;s dead.<p>What bothered me most about the IndexedDB fiasco with iOS8 is that Apple not only held out for so many years, but then they deployed a broken implementation. Anybody who had written an app using an IndexedDB shim either had a crashed site at best or lost user data at worst. YDN-DB author Kyaw Tun had the best quote: &quot;I don&#x27;t understand how they can release this.&quot;<p>Whether you like an API or not, a browser vendor should at least release it in good faith if they&#x27;re going to release it.",1435715981

This is what really makes it untenable - what is the logo for, what does effective mean, 90% of where? This is why brand creation is expensive as hell. There&#x27;s a lot of work involved and by definition it is bespoke and without shortcuts. That&#x27;s the whole point or it wouldn&#x27;t be brand creation in any sense. When you see a logotype, it&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg.<p>I suspect that a lot of people might think of branding as including these cheap services where an underpaid young offshore photoshop whizz throws together an infinity symbol, dolphin, or generic swoosh and even goes so far as to hand kern some text (and bear in mind that even this kind of junior typographic task can&#x27;t be automated yet).<p>I would argue that this isn&#x27;t a ghetto version of the kind of branding that a large company does, but a cargo cult version. The logotype part is highly visible but is the tiniest component of branding - it is superficial and meaningless in isolation. Very much unlike this process, real branding is about discovering and generating an extremely high input of info and ideas and turning this into a very small and focused output, articulating the essence. (And of course a big part of the cost for a large org is that you often need to cover things like web, print, letterheads, reports, sides of trucks, and so on. All whilst maintaining brand consistency.)<p>Assuming you can&#x27;t afford to pay for full branding, I think the best solution is to do just enough (e.g. many here might just need something for digital and business cards) and for it to be done by someone close to the company owner of even the owner themselves, as they will live and breathe what the company is for and what makes it distinct. Even poorly executed, this will communicate a much clearer story and have real value imo (trying to avoid the word authentic here but it&#x27;s probably applicable).",1435715723

I love the use of `exports` and generators make a lot of sense for this sort of control flow; I wrote a &quot;block&quot; system for Wordpress that used generators to allow you to render the blocks in a loop inside a template, pause execution of said loop and render more of the template, then continue on.

The aggregation operators are really surprisingly fast.<p>That said, one major downside to ES is that it&#x27;s not schemaless. You can try to use the dynamic mapping system, but it will most likely just bite you eventually, since ES is strict about coercing data types. If your data isn&#x27;t completely consistent, it will actually refuse to index it. Any changes made to your schema also requires reindexing. (For some reason ES can&#x27;t do in-place indexing, despite supporting storing all the original data in the &quot;_source&quot; field.)<p>If your data isn&#x27;t perfectly consistent, one way to work around the mapping problem is to append a type name to every field. So instead of indexing {&quot;user_id&quot;: &quot;3&quot;}, you index {&quot;user_id.string&quot;: &quot;3&quot;}. This means that if you get some input data where the user_id is an int, it doesn&#x27;t conflict because it will stored in &quot;user_id.int&quot;.

And that&#x27;s just one hour. And that doesn&#x27;t include the electricity production.<p><i>On panel material required for production:</i>
It&#x27;s generally estimated that US power, with good transmission, would require enough solar panels to cover the entire state of Massachusetts.  Most non solar advocates think it&#x27;s this square footage that&#x27;s important.  But of course this can largely be put on built land or in deserts so that is a relatively moot point.  In fact, I want to get solar panels on my roof.  However the real concern is what does this look like in terms of material mining?  In immense panel production factories? (which isn&#x27;t the greenest mfg process ever, likely one of the reasons it is largely done in China)<p><i>On mining and transporting material required:</i>
Mining is almost entirely powered by fossils, it has to be. And so is most transport. And so is recycling of metals. So the energy density of an energy source really is a zero sum game. If it takes a millionth the material for one source versus the other, that adds up.<p><i>On maintenance</i>
Then in maintenance, solar farms are truly &quot;farms&quot;- they require a lot of water to wash away dust to operate optimally. A states&#x27; worth of water is significant.<p><i>On lifetime/end of life</i>
First of all the lifetime of a panel is very optimistically 30 years/for a nuclear plant 60-80 years, and for the UPower fuel in particular can be used and recycled repeatedly for about 70+ years.<p><i>afterlife/recycling</i>
Then in recycling at end of life, and this is why I got so excited about nuclear as a somewhat hippie child growing up around oil companies in Oklahoma, solar is going to require a lot of energy (and fossil fuels or nuclear) to recycle, while nuclear can produce energy in recycling its fuel.<p>The main import, to me, is: what is the energy density of this energy, and if emitting, how much pollution? Coal is far more energy dense than wind, which is why humans evolved from windmills and wood to coal. But it&#x27;s so polluting which is why we are all working towards better sources, and the greater energy density (nuclear on order of 2M x any other source) that&#x27;s roughly 2M less trucks transporting, 2M less mining to do, 2M less recycling, etc.  Thats more on the environment than pure cost like you are saying but the costs add up if the full life cycle is taken into account on both sides.",1435714080

It will take a lot of time and effort to demonstrate that the layered protocol you propose is no less secure than vanilla TLS.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure whether it&#x27;s a good idea to make it so easy for typical users to add their own CA certificates to smart devices. Such a facility could be easily subverted by criminals and governments to eavesdrop on a large number of users.

They will put a lot of confidence in your judgement.  Many will be paying out of pocket.<p>I&#x27;m not going to give a soon to be doctor much advice, but question the studies.  Don&#x27;t just chalk up the non-responsive to statistics.  I&#x27;m not saying you should take heroic risks in trying to get the patient functioning again, but be honest.  I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with--Patient, &quot;The medication, and therapy didn&#x27;t work as I expected, but you will get better with time!&quot;.  Be honest about the results of your profession, especially when any chance of placebo cure is long gone.  In other words, don&#x27;t make the patients life worse because you picked a particularly ineffective speciality.

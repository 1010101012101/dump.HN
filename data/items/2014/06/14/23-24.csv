7893990,comment,7893440,7893973,6,0,tormeh,,,"Can the typechecker ensure that your matrices (constructed from files) have compatible dimensions to be multiplied together? No? None of the compilers I&#x27;ve tried are much good for numeric computing. Since the error-prone parts of writing your code are not made easier by the typechecker, a dynamic language works just as well and has much lower cognitive overhead.<p>Remember that scientists don&#x27;t care about the quality of their code. In many cases, once the code is complete, it will only run once and then be thrown away. There is no maintenance. Things like technical debt don&#x27;t exist.<p>And pragmatism? Haskell doesn&#x27;t even have loops. Loops with mutable variables inside are a very intuitive way of thinking about things and often a better fit to a problem than recursion. Sure, you can use tail recursion (which is just ugly looping) instead, but you&#x27;re adding unwanted cognitive overhead.<p>What I would like is a functional language with enclosed, sealed off loops. Syntactic sugar for tail recursion, basically, but Haskell isn&#x27;t built with programmers in mind; it&#x27;s built for CS researchers. Computer language researchers, more specifically.",1402789636

Behavior which may be acceptable against only male characters can get pretty bad when applied to females--consider the case of Postal 2, GTA, or any number of sandboxy games. Fallout, for what it&#x27;s worth, at least was equal opportunity and let you shoot both women and children in the face.<p>If you allow females in a game with violence as a major component, you open yourself up to all of the issues of some insecure jackass perpetuating violence against women and posting about it--or just getting yelled at straight-out for supporting that functionality at all.<p>EDIT:<p>It&#x27;s kind of funny, actually, that we were arguably more progressive in FPSs in the 90s than we are today.

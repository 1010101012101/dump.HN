558323,comment,557659,558316,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"The USA does import medical doctors from overseas to work in healthcare in rural areas under the J-1 visa program. Virtually no american born doctor will work in rural under-served areas anymore , even though the pay can be 3x as much as in big cities. If you go to a GP in South Dakota chances are she will be from Pakistan.",1239530328

558320,comment,557659,558316,0,0,potatolicious,,,"It's R&D versus labour. You don't want to import labour (e.g. doctors), but you want to import as much R&D personnel as you can get your hands on (this includes other professions such as biologist, physicist, etc).<p>The idea is that depriving, say, China of doctors doesn't really accomplish anything except generate more sick Chinese people, which doesn't really pose a major strategic advantage to the US. The only incentive to import them is if there is a major shortage locally (and so far there isn't).<p>On the other hand, depriving China of engineers can give a significant competitive boost to the US. The more researchers and developers you import the higher chance you have that something that would've been invented in a competing country is invented here instead.",1239530100

With OS 3.0, hardware add-ons for the iPhone just got a whole lot easier. Arguably the iPhone is already highly customizable, selling a billion apps which don't require a fixed keyboard.",1239529892
558317,comment,557659,557935,0,0,potatolicious,,,"""If any American wants to down-vote me for this, just go ahead and try to get a _job_ overseas.""<p>The failings of other, less-wise countries is not an excuse to fail along with them. They are xenophobic and protectionist, and turn away talent that can increase their nation's competitiveness... the US should not make that same mistake.<p>And keep in mind that a disproportionate number of big players who ""built the greatest economy in the world"" are themselves immigrants. Your argument that home-grown talent alone will suffice holds no water - historically the US has always relied on heavy talent import, and there is nothing wrong with this.",1239529877
558316,comment,557659,557985,0,0,gaius,,,"<i>Because we controlled the wages of engineers with a visa program, but not finance or legal professionals, we deterred our own from going into these fields</i><p>This is the key, really. Why should only engineering in general and computer programming in particular be ""special""? Why isn't the US importing medical doctors (for example) hand over fist? There is a very deliberate attempt to treat programming as not one of the ""professions"" but as labour.",1239529875
558315,comment,557659,558212,0,0,potatolicious,,,"That's what you have to do in America - that's not what you have to do in any other country. My coworkers in the US have remarked on this also - they visit Canada often and have never been given shit by a border guard; even when hassled, Canadian border guards are always polite.<p>Consider that for many people this will be their first interaction with an American at the beginning of their trip, it should be a higher priority that these people behave themselves.",1239529681

558311,comment,558277,558277,0,0,sgrove,,,"Seems like a reasonable clash of internal cultures. It's a questionable value add for the company, as fun as it may seem for the employees, and those wanting to try something new and edgy finally lost out (albeit at the very last moment) to those trying to be legally responsible.<p>In all reality, it probably would have been just fine with a bit of proper management (open at the appropriate times, the right ""Company Bar Etiquette"", etc.), would have renewed Microsoft's ""Cool place to work"" image a bit, and could have fostered a more loyal and cohesive workforce. But they might be able to reach those same goals without the clear risks involved in having a company bar.",1239528431

558302,comment,558134,558199,0,0,barrkel,,,"There are reasons why compilers for static languages complain so much for those uneducated in their type systems: because the constructs they are rejecting have, on balance, been determined to be unsound by the languages' designers.<p>And most of the time, these decisions are correct. In each language, however, there are usually a few exceptions, most of which are the result of learning over time. For example, Pascal over-uses nominal type equality, which is particularly pernicious with arrays, and, in classical Pascal, strings (fixed-length arrays of chars).<p>And in Java, requiring most possible exceptions to be part of the interface specification is a flaw resulting from a misunderstanding about exceptions: Java seems to feel that no exception should be ignored, while they should actually almost never be caught.<p>And then there are abhorrences like C++, where historical forces have combined to give the language user more power than they can comfortably wield, or can be comfortably implemented in any given compiler.",1239527223

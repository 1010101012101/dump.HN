9087160,comment,9086475,9086475,0,0,ryanjmo,,,"My lifestyle is pretty great right now, but it has changed and improved remarkably throughout the years.<p>I have found that at about $30K a month in spending money, is more money than I need, even in the most expensive cities (as long as I’m hanging out with normal people with normal jobs and don’t do anything to crazy that month).<p>Currently, I live between Aspen, CO and San Juan, PR.  I live in Aspen, because it is my favorite place in the world.  There are so many amazing outdoor activities and the girls there are the best in the world (for me, I&#x27;m kind-of and extreme sports person and there are a lot of girls like that up there).  The party scene is hard to beat up in Aspen, in both the summer and the winter.<p>Mostly though, I dirt bike all summer in the mountains and ski and snowmobile all winter.<p>I just recently moved to Puerto Rico for a percentage of the year for the great tax benefits of living here.  So far it has been really good.  I live in Old San Juan, which is somewhat like living in the Mission in SF.  Dirty, grimy, hispstery and fun.<p>I walk or get driven everywhere I go.  I don&#x27;t like driving at all and don&#x27;t really need to either place I live.  I am in walking distance to 20 great bars and restaurants in both places.<p>I try to work every weekday from 8am-4pm EST no matter what timezone I’m in.  That doesn’t always happen, but the more I work, the better, more stable and more profitable my business gets.<p>What I have found to be most important, is to make sure that I get up and get emails out early, so that no matter what is really going on in my life, it signals to everyone who interacts with my business that, I’m up early and working hard every day, which is often the case anyway.<p>However, for example, on Friday me my employee and a girl from down here, took the day off and had an awesome drunken brunch on the beach.<p>My number one employee and best friend, lives and travels around with me.  We are an awesome team together and get shit done in all parts of our lives.  We eat out every meal and I literally pay for everything for him when we are together.  It feels a lot like he is my kid in a lot of ways, lol.<p>I’ve had girlfriends throughout the years, but almost every one of them has been unemployed or working on something like acting or trying to start a business.  It is really hard for me to date someone with a 9-5, I think because my lifestyle is so flexible (I also require a lot of attention).  My last girlfriend was a consultant and worked at home, which was the best set up so far.  We would just work next to each other from each others apartments.<p>It took a good amount of time to get here.  I’ve been founding companies for about 6-7 years.  This is my third entity.  Back in the day I was living on the floor in the ghetto of Berkeley, CA without an extra dime to spend on anything other than Ramen.<p>I’m looking to the future right now.  Hoping to grow my business, save some money, spend a lot of money and have a lot of fun.<p>My next big plan, is to get a harem of girls to simultaneously be my girlfriends and travel with me between Aspen, Puerto Rico and the rest of the world.  I’ve been working on it, getting apartments set up in both places that will work for this.  Also, I’ve been looking for super smart, super hot girls who would be down for this.<p>So far, you’d be surprised at the reactions of most of the girls who I tell my plan to.  Very few have been negative about it.  Most have been at minimum supportive and they think it is cool.<p>I know it is a ridiculous “goal” for the future, but there are no real rules and boundaries in my life and I am going to do my best to take full advantage of this one awesome life :)<p>So far I think I’m on a good track.",1424555891

It is generally the &#x27;skeptic&#x27; ignorantly asserting &#x27;there is no consensus&#x27; which brings focus to the concept in that debate:<p>&quot;The skeptic attitude to consensus usually starts with “there is no consensus”. That’s wrong, and they usually retreat from it to “but consensus science is meaningless”, and/or “consensus has nothing to do with science”. The latter is largely true but irrelevant. The existence of the consensus doesn’t do a lot to determine what science is done; it doesn’t prevent contrary lines being explored. But the consensus view does come into the tricky interface between science and policy, and science and the media.&quot; [1]<p>> they assert that results about medical science are distorted by financial pressures, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean here? Much science conducted is so distorted by financial pressure that it isn&#x27;t scientific. Consider how an entire area of research in the pharmaceutical industry should probably just be binned [2].<p>Considering this, it is more essential than ever in considering the individuals carrying out the research. As long as we have weak and corrupted regulatory systems there will be a continued distrust of any industry-sponsored research, and in many areas that&#x27;s the research that dominates.<p>Until there&#x27;s a global change in how research is funded and conducted there seems little hope of trusting that the output is very scientific.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/just-what-is-this-consensus-anyway/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/just-w...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.badscience.net/books/bad-pharma/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.badscience.net/books/bad-pharma/</a>",1424555784

I don&#x27;t have constant reminders about my low place in the organization&#x27;s hierarchy. My customers and I enter into a business transaction as peers. This mutual respect is very important to me.<p>3. I have absolute control over my work. I like the freedom to pursue my product&#x27;s vision without having to stop and justify it to others.<p>4. I like succeeding at business development. I’ve met a lot of “pure business” people who would like me to believe there’s something special to what they do. There isn’t. As a programmer, I find this very empowering.<p>5. I also like succeeding without investors.

If you think about what it means to have a garbage-collected version of C for just a few minutes it should become immediately clear why abandoning GC for Objective-C is necessary and appropriate. The GC can&#x27;t always reliably detect a reference (pointer) so it has to be conservative. It also can&#x27;t compact the heap, which means you don&#x27;t get the nice &quot;allocation is just advancing a pointer&quot; behavior that makes allocations nearly instantaneous in managed languages.<p>ARC is essentially just the old rules for manual reference counting (MRC), but the compiler analyzes your code and inserts the retain/release/autorelease calls automatically. This gives you similar deterministic behavior as MRC but while writing the code it feels like a garbage collected language because you mostly ignore management of memory and everything &quot;just works&quot;.<p>The downside to ARC is the inability to detect retain cycles and a slight performance hit compared to MRC in some scenarios. The performance is actually pretty good... What ARC loses compared to hand-coding it gains by using special runtime functions<i></i> (not slower ObjC message sends) that elide unnecessary retain/release calls in many situations.<p><i></i> objc_retainAutoreleaseReturnValue is inserted in a caller and callee (typically a property getter). It examines the return address on the stack to detect if the caller is going to invoke objc_retainAutoreleaseReturnValue on the returned value; if so it just does a retain and sets a flag the caller uses to skip doing retain+autorelease, leaving the caller&#x27;s release only. Instead of the object staying alive until the next run loop iteration and getting autoreleased it can safely be released immediately, plus at least one extra pair of function calls can be eliminated.",1424553885

Every case I&#x27;ve encountered where there is a skepticism of Indian workers is due to horrific experiences with such hires. I haven&#x27;t seen the same applied to, say, Russian engineers.<p>There may be a another reason, like just the sheer population and widespread English usage, but the result is that Indians suffer an unfair bias that other groups don&#x27;t have. Things like MS shipping a major product made in IDC, with broken English in the dialogs. Or so many outsourced support and development failures. Perhaps it&#x27;s because bad experiences are noticed because there was an interaction. But good experiences, say excellent code written by anonymous Google engineers, doesn&#x27;t have any particular nationality associated with it (except American)? So if all tech support and dev was outsourced to Russia, then Russia would have a disproportionate bad rep?<p>It&#x27;s not fair (or perhaps not even fixable in a fair way), but if more interactions were positive, then there&#x27;d be less resistance.<p>I feel bad for having an internal reaction when I start dealing with an Indian, but I try to balance that out by making an extra effort to be sure I&#x27;m concentrating on the work. And I know there&#x27;s tons of far-more-talented-than-me Indians. It terrifies me that this bias might be mathematically incorrect, in addition to being individually unfair.",1424552849

You&#x27;ve displaced their job and gave it to an Indian who is paid less (so the article suggests). Less federal income tax, less state tax and it&#x27;s not unreasonable to assume that a portion of the paycheck will be returned to India.<p>This is why we have foreign aid budgets and charities.

I do not believe economics is a zero-sum game, which would imply that the moral thing to do is to reduce our own fortunes to increase that of others less fortunate.<p>I think that some countries, being extremely successful, can both help guide other countries into successful strategies (there are hundreds of large scale economic experiments going on at all times by the nature of different states), and help bolster those countries that have followed strategies that were less optimal (global aid).<p>I do not believe this gives a blank check to some countries to ignore the less fortunate portions of the world, there is an obligation, enforced up by the reality of the threats these places produce, to attempt to help the world as a whole advance, which it largely has done over hundreds of years.  This is analogous to the differences in the populace within a country, but I think it&#x27;s easier for people to see it on a world stage, even if they don&#x27;t equate it to income disparity within a country.<p>The global system we&#x27;ve been using, with countries largely distinct, has yielded great gains. Altering major aspects of that system should not be taken lightly, as unforeseen implications could cause great problems (would the world be served better overall if free movement between these countries caused a depression within America, and that happened to trigger a global depression?).

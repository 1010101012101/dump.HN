Developers can create forks within the team namespace and send pull requests between themselves and to the official &quot;blessed&quot; repo from which releases are done. Those with write access to some repositories can commit to those repos and also merge pull requests. Admin can basically do everything within the team namespace.<p>That said, congratulations on keeping GitLab rolling forward with more and more features and bugfixes every release.<p>Edit: Fixed a typo and added some more detail.",1424786394

But even assuming it had no bad long term effects on the brain, if one were a regular user then it would regularly drop your intelligence and motivation, which itself is a disadvantage. This is no different than drinking regularly.<p>I may be more keenly aware of this than people in the US, but life is a global competition for resources, and it&#x27;s unwise to squander your competitive edge.<p>Ritalin probably has more risks, I&#x27;ve not decided that it&#x27;s worth the tradeoff yet.<p>I guess the core of your question is a deeper one about life, happiness, and the tradeoffs we make. I think the answer to that is different for everyone. Life is short and without intrinsic meaning. You have to focus on what gives it value for you, which is likely very different from the next person. For me, I enjoy creating things, and I feel most alive when in the zone churning out code.

Switching the order just makes the expression harder to understand, like reusing variables within a scope.  Addition is commutative and there&#x27;s nothing technically wrong with it, but this construction makes it appear like there may be something special about element n when there&#x27;s not.<p>The programmer also has to do mental arithmetic to check the bounds.  Bounds checks can be written so that the largest index subtracted is also the value tested:<p><pre><code>    if (n >= 1 && runLen[n-1] <= runLen[n] + runLen[n+1]  \n     || n >= 2 && runLen[n-2] <= runLen[n-1] + runLen[n])\n</code></pre>\nThis makes it easier to see that the bounds are correct.

The point of decentralisation is not that everyone has a copy of the truth. It&#x27;s that a sufficient number of nodes have a copy of the truth, such that you can check a number of them and easily verify the veracity of the data. Many blockchain applications run not by querying their own blockchain but rather querying a number of trusted sources via their API. Coinbase, Bitpay, Chain.com, Blockcypher etc all offer APIs to interface with their blockchain nodes and others.<p>It&#x27;s like saying Facebook will never work because you can&#x27;t possible store the worlds&#x27; photos on everyone&#x27;s smartphones. You don&#x27;t have to, Facebook stores it on their server. Similarly we will see, and already see, dedicated servers that store the blockchain, and as long as you have enough independent ones you can maintain decentralisation just as if you were hosting your own node.<p>There&#x27;s absolutely no need to host the blockchain on small embedded devices any more than any other data, like music or photos we normally host on dedicated servers instead.<p>> but truncating the chain (or only storing some kind of &quot;working set&quot;) isn&#x27;t feasible either.<p>Yes it is. What makes you say it isn&#x27;t? Pruning the blockchain is something that&#x27;s currently being worked on.<p>The idea is that if I send you $1 a million times and you send it back $1m times, every day, for the next 1 billion years, we could either store terabytes and terabytes of data of all these transactions, or we could store the end result (= no change occurred) and the last couple weeks of transaction data. The rest can be pruned. Because each block has a hash of all its transactions, and this hash is used to mine the next block (hence a chain of blocks, blockchain), we needn&#x27;t store each individual transaction, we have the hash to verify the truth of transactions.<p>We might have some universities saving all transactions for posterity & research, and some businesses for data mining, but the vast majorities of nodes that just need to secure the network can indeed, without security issues, not store long-spent outputs. (i.e. bitcoins that have already been spent many times over. e.g. if I give a dollar to you and you give it to the next guy, and he to the next girl, and so on 100 times, at that point there&#x27;s absolutely no reason to store on every node the fact I gave a dollar to you for the security of the network.)<p>> Not to mention the gargantuan download that&#x27;s required for that initial setup to get up to date with the latest network transactions.<p>Again, no need to have all redundant transactions. The pruned blockchain would currently be under a gigabyte large. Second, headers-first has already been implemented which made the initial setup much, much faster.<p>Beyond that, we mustn&#x27;t forget that the average American makes 2 transactions a day. And one such transaction is about 400 bytes or so, in bitcoin. If you compare this to tweets, or an hour of netflix, it&#x27;s puny. If you count up all the data, it&#x27;s about $8 to store one day of all of US consumer transactions on a retail harddrive. Imagine the cost of storage for Mastercard for one of their nodes was $8, and instead of just powering a fraction of US retail, they&#x27;d literally handle every single transaction by themselves and store them all for $8. Even if you wanted to have thousands of nodes and store the last year of data (and given the velocity of money, you wouldn&#x27;t have to as again, you can prune data after money has been spent a couple times), that&#x27;s a puny amount of money to power an entire consumer financial system of the world&#x27;s biggest economy. And given storage, like CPU and bandwidth, on a 50-60% yoy growth rate (Kryders, Moore&#x27;s and Nielsen&#x27;s laws), I think by the time bitcoin becomes important enough to run 100% of US retail (which is likely never, but hypothetically speaking), that $8 will have dropped to below $0.10 easily.<p>I know I&#x27;m taking big shortcuts here but this is just to illustrate the economics are extremely favorable today and in the future. I don&#x27;t know if bitcoin will succeed or fail, but I&#x27;m pretty near certain it won&#x27;t fail because storage/cpu/bandwidth isn&#x27;t affordable enough for nodes to make it viable to run the network. I and many others have looked into this quite a bit and these aren&#x27;t big problems. Bitcoin has big obstacles (no gigantic consumer benefits in a world of decent fintech like every OECD country to use bitcoin directly, is one), but storage probably isn&#x27;t one of em.",1424784489

That is, and should be, the role of local and central Government.<p>When you buy a boat in the UK (on CRT waterways), there are clear rules, in force since 1992, that you must either have a permanent mooring for it or undertake to move on to a different place every 14 days (&quot;continuously cruising&quot;). Numerous people have tried to avoid the expense of a permanent mooring by declaring themselves to be &quot;continuously cruising&quot; but actually staying in the same place. That is what this petition is seeking to legalise.<p>If it were accepted, CRT would lose out two-fold: it would have greater costs in providing facilities and maintaining the waterways as more people bought boats simply to use as cheap houses, and it would have significantly lower income as people learned that they can get away without paying for a permanent mooring. Yet even now, CRT doesn&#x27;t have enough money to maintain its 2,500 miles of waterways to a safe, reliable standard - just look at the recent breach on the Trent & Mersey Canal as an example.<p>I feel for the people who can&#x27;t afford to live in London and have alighted on boats as a cheap way to do so.

If you look at Bitcoin, there&#x27;s an ecosystem of millions of users, over 100 thousand merchants including some of the world&#x27;s biggest companies like Microsoft, hundreds of bitcoin-focused VC-backed startups of which one had a valuation nearing half a billion dollars etc etc.<p>While it&#x27;s obvious that bitcoins are overvalued in relation to this ecosystem (i.e. a substantial part of its price is based on speculation that the ecosystem will become massively important in the future), there already is a genuine ecosystem out there with decent growth rates.<p>Dogecoin or litecoin don&#x27;t have that. They have communities that keep them alive but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a long term viability. This is different from bitcoin&#x27;s early days (which didn&#x27;t have any real ecosystem either at one point) in that bitcoin actually offered something radically new, while litecoin for example isn&#x27;t innovative, it was the first me-too that didn&#x27;t totally screw over its early investors in a pump & dump scheme so it&#x27;s stayed around but it doesn&#x27;t offer anything special. Does that mean they have no value? Absolutely not. They do. But &#x27;me-too&#x27; companies also have value in the short-term. In the long term they usually don&#x27;t survive. We&#x27;re already seeing that, litecoin for example dropped insanely in price (like 90%) in the past year and that&#x27;s not just because bitcoin readjusted after late 2013&#x27;s hype cycle, it crashed against bitcoin itself, too, i.e. the market is already identifying that litecoin versus just bitcoin doesn&#x27;t have a future in the long-run. And if there&#x27;s ANYTHING you have to know about bitcoin is that it&#x27;s almost always spoken about in a long-term frame of reference. If we purely look at the short term then yes, we can say dogecoin & litecoin have value and so does bitcoin, but we would also have to say that all three combined are absolutely insignificant, a drop in the ocean, the size of a mid-cap fund of which there are thousands. The short-term isn&#x27;t interesting, in the short-term me-toos exist, in the long-run they don&#x27;t.<p>In short, the reason people say litecoin has no value is not because it&#x27;s not being traded: that&#x27;s speculation. It&#x27;s that it is said to have no utility value over bitcoin. Bitcoin can power any utility litecoin can, with more liquidity, more market participants, more open-source libraries & development, more funding, more security etc.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll all be using bitcoins necessarily, but I do believe we&#x27;ll all be using bitcoin (or no cryptocurrency at all, of course, that&#x27;s very possible, too). i.e. yes there are niches in digital currency, but the cryptocurrency niches will, I think, if they exist in the long-term, be served by products running on top of the bitcoin network. Anything litecoin or dogecoin can do, a bitcoin treechain or sidechain or payment channel can do but with the above mentioned benefits. It&#x27;s like saying there are different niches in internet protocols, as if to say the internet may run on many different protocols that serve different niches in the long-term, instead of saying TCP/IP powers the internet and it has higher-level protocols that serve niches like http or smtp. Within that line of thinking, anything but TCP/IP has no long-term value and any niche in internet technology will be built on top of that one protocol. Similarly many who say &#x27;litecoin has no value&#x27; think of bitcoin as being the protocol for value transfer, and anything having to do with transferring value (or titles, contracts etc) will be built on top of it, rather than along side it.<p>In short, the claim that litecoin has no value (despite having a market value) makes a lot of sense depending on what you believe about the future of cryptocurrency.",1424782906

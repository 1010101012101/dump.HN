However, this graph only shows the top 100 apps, which when taking the universe of 600,000 apps, is only 0.0166% of the universe.<p>Let's suppose that ""middle class"" of the app universe would be around the 70th percentile in the universe [2]. In this case we should look at the year over year revenue growth and market share growth of the 180,000th ranking app in the app store. I wonder if we could get numbers on such stats?<p>[1] <a href=""http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/revenuenormalize_byrank-resized-600.png?w=640"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/revenuen...</a><p>[2] Potentially flawed assumption.",1343840341

Why would all these game developers agree to be in a video endorsing the product, but not actually front money for it?<p>iD/Zenimax, Epic and Valve would all see the hoped for $250 000 as chump change for a dev kit. Split between the three and it's essentially nothing. My guess is Microsoft or Sony would love nothing more than to tie up an exclusive peripheral for their next-gen consoles, and buy the company outright (as MS did with Kinect). This would be a true differentiator.<p>That they're looking to Kickstarter to sell $300 dev kits makes me think something very bad is going unsaid. My wild guess is that they still give people headaches as with previous VR attempts, and no-one is willing to put money in the pot with the expectation that it is unsolvable.<p>People putting money into this are as crazy as those who put money into the OUYA.",1343840341

4324063,comment,4323677,4323897,7,0,Gormo,,,"I'm not sure you can get a touch UI 'right' on a desktop PC.  Even if there was some theoretical way to add a fully-functional touch layer to a desktop OS without obscuring or limiting access to the OS's functionality, you'd still end up having to support two distinct and unrelated interface conventions for everything, which means that in practice, every interface paradigm will likely be suboptimal.<p>MS's stated intention was to have a consistent UI across phones, tablets, and desktops.  This strikes me as an utterly absurd notion: different products call for different interfaces, each designed to maximize the unique benefits of that particular product.  Phones, tablets, and PCs are <i>not</i> generally substitute goods; each of them has its own set of strengths and weaknesses, and a common UI just obscures them beneath a lowest-common-denominator facade.",1343840171

It will run Windows RT (previously called WOA, ""Windows-on-ARM""), and support Metro (touch) apps exclusively. Main expected software distribution channel is the Windows app store.

Here companies are not liable for misuse by idiots. If an average person understands you can not microwave your cat, then there is no liability when an idiot does that. On the other hand, companies can not distance themselves from being liable for harm due to defects.<p>Either case, legal terms are not very relevant either way. Because they do not constitute a proper effort of informing. That last part is very relevant. Implicit terms can not define the context, only try to formalize it.",1343839211

4323910,comment,4323742,4323893,2,0,pizza,,,"Body:<p>Today marks an important milestone in the Windows 8 project. The Windows 8 team is proud to share with you that a short while ago we started releasing Windows 8 to PC OEM and manufacturing partners. This means our next milestone will be the availability of exciting new models of PCs loaded with Windows 8 and online availability of Windows 8 on October 26, 2012.<p>Back when we first demonstrated Windows 8 in May 2011, we described it as reimagining Windows, from the chipset to the experience, and that is what Windows 8 (and Windows RT) represents for both Microsoft and partners. The collective work: from the silicon, to the user experience, to new apps, has been an incredibly collaborative effort. Together we are bringing to customers a new PC experience that readies Windows PCs for a new world of scenarios and experiences, while also preserving an industry-wide 25-year investment in Windows software.<p>We continue to be sincerely humbled by the breadth of participation in our pre-release testing. The previews of Windows 8 (Developer, Consumer, Release) have been the most widely and deeply used test releases of any product we have ever done. Over 16 million PCs actively participated in these programs, including approximately 7 million on the Release Preview that started 8 weeks ago. The depth and breadth of testing validate the readiness of Windows 8 for the market.<p>The openness of the previews presents a unique perspective on product development, and were deeply committed to the transparency of the preview process. No product used by so many people in so many different ways is developed out in the open like Windows 8 has been. This blog, the forums, and the preview releases form an important part of the development process. Major changes have been made at each milestone and as we promised, the final release (build 9200, for those tracking) contains many promised refinements. We are humbled by the responsibility of meeting the needs of such a diverse set of customers and enthused by the deep level of participation in the pre-release process.<p>While we have reached our RTM milestone, no software project is ever really done. We will continue to monitor and act on your real world experiences with Windows 8weve used the preview process to test out our servicing and we have every intent of doing a great job on this next important phase of the product. Hardware partners will continue to provide new devices and improve support for existing devices. PC makers no doubt have quite a bit in store for all of us as they begin to show off PCs specifically designed for Windows 8.<p>With improvements in fundamentals, enhanced storage and connectivity, newly architected subsystems, the fast and fluid user experience, and the WinRT platform (to name a few), Windows 8 has literally thousands of new features. We did a record number of blogs posts (and videos) and did not even come close to covering the full breadth of Windows 8. Theres much left to learn about and discover in the product.<p>Some of the most exciting innovations with Windows 8 are yet to comethe innovations from developers building apps on the new WinRT platform. Today, the Store is open for business and well rapidly expand to over 200 markets around the world. The opportunity for developers around the world to deliver innovative (and profitable) apps is unique with Windows 8. Were excited to see the work developers will be bringing to Windows 8. Well also have a chance to talk more about the Windows 8 platform at the next BUILD conference recently announced.<p>We know there are lots of questions about how to get Windows 8 and when, and of course more questions to come about exploring and using the full set of thousands of Windows 8 features. Our Windows Team Blog today has posted a lot of new information and gathered up some important details that we hope will answer your questions. Please check our blog and stay in touch on the in-market developments of Windows 8 there.<p>On behalf of the Windows 8 engineering team, we want to thank you very much for your contributions throughout development and your contributions yet to come to Windows 8. THANK YOU!<p>Next stop, October 26, 2012 and General Availability!<p>--The Windows 8 team",1343838875

Instead of simple for-loops you have to use recursion, if you want to do something as primitive as assigning to a variable you have to learn about monads, instead of control flow operators you have to use functions-as-values, and the type system is based on a foundational mathematical topic called lambda calculus.<p>Just to be clear: I'm a fan of FP, and I don't think it makes simple things hard.

You will likely be hopping from project to project on a regular basis, depending on which team has the greatest need of your knowledge at any given moment. You will work closely with designers and developers to build usable and compelling interfaces. You will have many opportunities to try new things and work on the cutting edge of what's possible.<p>Who do we need?\nWe need someone who lives and breathes JavaScript. Our team has some experience, but we're looking for someone who writes their own plugins and relishes the challenge of writing a solution from scratch. We want someone who can help teach the rest of the team, and encourage best practices. We recognize that JS is an increasingly central component of the types of web and mobile apps we build, and we're looking for someone who can help take us to the next level.<p>Who are we?\nWe're not just another boring agency building brochure sites. We're a growing development shop who specializes in building compelling and usable apps using Ruby on Rails, iOS, and Android. We practice agile development, which means you'll be working closely with the client, designers, and developers at every stage, not just being handed comps and a deadline. We reward hard work and believe strongly in a sustainable work/life balance.<p>Benefits\n401(K), PTO, Medical/Dental Plans, Health Savings Account. Company outings. Conferences and book budget. Creative work environment with beer-bust Fridays, game room and fully stocked kitchen onsite.<p>If you think you're the right person for the job, send your resume and examples of your work (ideally your github repo) to jobs@elctech.com",1343838554

Classical OOP in which the constructor does the computation and the methods do the querying on the new encapsulated structure seems to be a good fit for that. This is subtly different than treating methods as allowable operations because were not concerned with transforming the structure, just asking easy questions about it.

He made it easier for our clients to launch multiple email tests in parallel, and added four new email providers to our growing list of integrated partners.<p>Jon and David worked together to completely redesign the interface of the application. We moved from an interface that focused on browsing through dashboards to one that delivers answers to specific questions.<p>Outside the office, Corey and Dave manned a booth at a big e-retailer conference and developed a Blackjack-style Custora game to play with prospective clients.<p>What We Offer<p>Our compensation is competitive with anyone on the market.

4323746,comment,4316685,4319947,1,0,bunderbunder,,,"If we're talking about banning copyright altogether, that seems to go well beyond Stallman's position. His objection to these kinds of restrictions seems to only extend to software.  (e.g., ""Game art is a different issue, because it isn't software."")<p>You also seem to deeply misunderstand his position on copyright. Far from only functioning to ""prevent individuals from creating or sharing their work"", Stallman himself writes his essay ""Misinterpreting Copyright"" that he sees the function of copyright as a way to benefit end-users by <i>incentivizing</i> people to create and share their work. And with this I agree with Mr. Stallman - and apparently disagree with you - wholeheartedly.<p>The point where our opinions diverge is whether this goal is served or hindered by closed-source software. RMS contends that software is a sort of special case.  He gives all sorts of reasons which are largely valid complaints, but ultimately he has failed to see the forest for the trees. His complaints are only of much note to a small elite of hackers like ourselves - for the vast majority of the population, they simply do not outweigh the advantages that he agrees justify the existence of copyright in any other situation.  As far as most people are concerned, the kind of software that is produced most plentifully when motivated by the profit incentive that copyright is designed to create has improved people's quality of life to an extent that public domain software can match only under what history has shown to be a very limited set of circumstances.  Oftentimes those circumstances relegate it to a critical but, one must admit, supporting role - SQLite has done much for a lot of people, but it tends to do the most when it's sitting behind commercial software.  And in those situations public domain (or even Free) software is a very good thing.<p>But I don't get the impression that RMS particularly cares about that consideration - he's much more worried about his own desires as a hacker, and he's willing to tell other people that their desires as members of the technological laity are immoral in the service of those desires.  Or perhaps he just doesn't see what he's doing.  Either way he's never been opposed to copyright as you suggest.  He's actually rather a fan of copyright.  He just doesn't like it when it's keeping him out of the source code.<p>Now if we wanted to discuss whether copyright protections last for an order of mangitude longer than they should (which they do), or whether laws governing the enforcement of copyright are draconian (which they are), that would be different. And, incidentally, that's another spot where I wholeheartedly agree with the Free Software Foundation's position.",1343837604

But we're not simply using frameworks, we're pushing them well beyond what they were intended to do.  So if you've got relevant framework experience, that's great.  But we really need engineers that are good at the basics: JavaScript, DOM, HTML, and CSS.  You'll also need to be decent at UI design and user experience.  If you're not just good but great at either of these things (or both!), that's awesome, but we also need you to be able to write code.  This isn't just a run of the mill web dev job.  This is actual, hard core software engineering, it just happens that the stuff we're (the UI team) doing is all running in the browser.<p>Tidemark is building a hosted business analytics system, which is way more interesting than it might sound.

",,"What types of complexity would be involved in computationally comparing 2 genomes to find over-expressed genes?<p>There has been news of success in comparing the genome sequences between cancer cells and healthy cells. I would like to hear any expert opinions regarding the complexity.<p>Some background:<p>The goal is to sequence patients' and their cancer's genomes, then compute the gene candidates to target for drug therapy, based on the difference of the two ( I know it's more complicated than that ). It took researchers a month to process the data, between the diff of normal and malignant cells. They then found a likely candidate gene that was over-expressed in the cancer cells- and coincidentally, a drug existed that targeted the gene, to the apparent success of the patient.<p>http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/12455\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/health/in-gene-sequencing-treatment-for-leukemia-glimpses-of-the-future.html",1343836897

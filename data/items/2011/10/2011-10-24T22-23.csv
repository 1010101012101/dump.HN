Primarily, I considered:<p>1. Content producers control Netflix's ability to succeed; they could either support significant fragmentation across multiple service providers (allowing many entrants/competitors and driving up prices for their content) or distribute directly (eliminate middle men altogether)<p>2. Multiple competitors are or could potentially price much lower than Netflix streaming based on totally different business models; Amazon subsidizes streaming to drive sales in their core business and Google could do the same using an advertising-based model<p>3. Last point here is pretty subjective, but I didn't think Netflix was a likely takeover target by the majors (i.e. key competitors), especially given that Hulu is also on the block; Google already has platform, users and device-level distribution through YouTube and Amazon has much the same, in addition to already profiting from Netflix's growth (through AWS)<p>I had problems making a long-term case for NFLX and the blunders of leadership further eroded my confidence.

So, then, isn't the threat that Wikileaks represents mostly indirect (i.e. it might incite civil unrest if people knew what their governments were actually doing)?<p>If that's the case, then, why defend hate speech and not Wikileaks? It seems to me that hate speech also has the very real potential of inciting violence (holocaust, pogroms, etc).<p>I agree with you, though, that Wikileaks probably is more dangerous (in the people-could-get-killed sense) than Stormfront, right now. It certainly seems much more likely that Wikileaks could cause violent rioting (and worse) than that Stormfront will suddenly come to power, although my observations don't extend past the US. It could well be the case that neo-nazis are a bigger problem in other parts of the world.<p>Personally, I find myself becoming more pro-Wikileaks as I see more interviews of Assange. The man is articulate and <i>logically consistent</i> (a rarity for any public figure) and I've found his arguments quite compelling. If you haven't seen him speak, I'd recommend it.

3151966,comment,3151524,3151810,14,0,tomkarlo,,,"P/E is only one metric and it's potentially very deceptive. You're using a PE that's uncorrected for expenses that are essentially investment in future business growth rather than a fundamental part of the business model. Amazon, for example, is hiring tons of new employees to build out its AWS business; that's a positive sign (it shows they believe that's a good investment) but in the short term it will drive down their earnings, because the cost of those employees is incurred now in exchange for business in future years.<p>So with Amazon, you have a denominator that's growing, and a numerator that's depressed by the investment in growth. That results in a very high PE.<p>MSFT and Apple, by comparison, are great companies but the market isn't expecting them to grow a lot (esp given how big they already are.) They're priced at a level where the market basically expects their earnings to stay steady going forward.<p>30X earnings is still not cheap for a tech company. It's in a spot where you'd have to look at the growth prospects, etc. to decide if it's a good deal.<p>PE makes the most sense if you're comparing very mature companies with similar size, growth and operating metrics. If that's not the case, it's not very useful.",1319496352

I don't think this affects the user experience as meaningfully as people claim.  I think people in general are used to multiple providers and are much more willing to accept it.

That network is equipped with a pair of cisco 6509's with sup2-msfc2s (old gear, but perfectly adequate for the task at hand). Each router has 3x 1gb uplinks to different providers (internap, time warner, and level3) running BGP. All of three ISP's peer directly with Netflix's AS. The problems persisted whether I was behind my routing, or statically routing by grabbing an IP on the /29 stub network each provider gives me to establish the bgp connection).<p>I tested both from behind my routing, and for fun, from my testing subnets (the stub networks) which statically route through their respective uplinks. Plenty of bandwidth, no mid-level ISP to insert QoS wankery. Same problems.<p>As for owning the movie, did that even come up in my previous comment? If so, then forgive me, it's not something I care about. In the rare instance (3-4x per month) where I want to watch a movie, I just want it to work. I don't want it to pause every few minutes to see a ""buffering"" screen. That's three steps backwards.<p>The commonality between both laptops is that they run os x( one on snow leopard, one on lion). I suspect silverlight is the real culprit, but I don't care. The solution would be to allow customers to buffer large chunks of the movie (20-30%) or download the whole movie before playing. Instead Netflix (probably due to being hamstrung by their agreements with content providers) tries to be too clever with variable bit-rate encoding and ruins the viewing experience. (even one pause is unacceptable in my book, let alone the 5-10 I often had per movie).<p>Whenever I discuss this with others, some people have similar quality problems, some people claim it works perfectly making me wonder if it's platform specific. Out of curiosity, are you running Mac, Windows, or Linux?<p>Also, the silverlight client has ridiculously bad volume control, I never quite understood why that is.",1319495041

Netflix is destined to die unless they can find a way to diversify; as you said, the rights holders want to cut out the middle man. The overhead requisite in old-world rental chains like Blockbuster is sufficiently prohibitive that the media companies did not have an interest in supplanting that market, but now that Netflix has proven the viability of online delivery, apparently media companies don't think it prohibitive to set up some servers and stream reruns.<p>Netflix perhaps should consider transitioning from a consumer-facing service to a white-label technology provider, developing things like the recommendation engine, rental and streaming platform, etc. and licensing to media companies as the basis for their several services. Unfortunately, I think the unified collection in services like Netflix is going to go away as media companies' greed drives them to try to take their own slice of the pie, probably resulting in fewer subscribers all the way around and potentially a resurgence of brick-and-mortar video rental, where, it appears, media companies still are not interested.<p>All that said, $300 was grossly overpriced for a company whose entire existence depends on the benevolence of a handful of major media producers.",1319495016

One of my cousins just finished her Chemotherapy for melanoma and my Aunt was able to get through her Chemotherapy for breast cancer.  Another one of my friends was also diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  My mother currently has a spot of melanoma on her nose that could cause her to lose it or need serious surgery.<p>All of the ordeals really got me thinking that I should be doing more for the Cancer cause, especially since I currently have a stable job with some time on the side.<p>Ive developed a site called CureCart.com which basically offers all of the items on Amazon.com at the same prices, only I get a commission for every sale.  I split half of this commission with cancer research funds (So far only the American Cancer Society).  The reason I only split half right now is because you can only get a tax write off for 50% of your income.  If I donate more, I basically end up going negative after taxes (Theoretically I could donate 85% and break even after an estimated 30% tax rate, however, I have been using the other 50% for Google Adwords and Facebook ads).  I have made a total of about $50 over the past month at a commission rate of about 6% per order.<p>I really think that this idea could go big why wouldnt people want to start at CureCart.com and get the same items/service from Amazon.com while helping others?  Ive spent a good chunk of change on advertising without much luck.  It has been quite difficult to get visitors to my site and I have actually spent much more of my own money on advertising than the site has made.<p>Do you guys have any ideas on how I can get my site out there any better?  Ive contacted about 150 non-profit organizations in hope that they would want to be featured on my site in return for donations, however, most of them have said that I need to have had a company that is at least a year old.   Ive also formed an LLC in hopes of attracting more non-profits to feature them but Im afraid that will take too long.<p>I appreciate any comments/suggestions.  Thanks!<p>-Jeff",1319494406

3151848,comment,3149320,3150998,7,0,scelerat,,,"If you've ever driven or biked in San Francisco (or I'm assuming any other marginally bike-friendly city) you'll quickly understand that for bicyclists, stop signs are yields and red lights are stop signs. You're just going to have to get used to that, at least on low-volume, low-speed streets.<p>That of course is not what the law says, and many people (especially drivers and people who don't like bicycles) will disagree. However, it's a cultural norm which, when ignored, leads to far more frustrating four-way encounters. e.g. ""law-abiding"" cyclist approaches stop sign at the same time a car on the right has already arrived. Car, expecting cyclist to enter intersection (because that's what every other cyclist does) waits. Other cars approach intersection. Cyclist, wanting to abide by the law, slows so that first car can proceed through the intersection. Car waits, expecting cyclist to go through. Other cars wait. Law-abiding cyclist comes to complete stop. Well-meaning (but wrong) car motions cyclist to proceed, ceding right of way. Other cars seethe. Precious seconds wasted.<p>Sometimes as a cyclist it's better to just run that stop sign and save everybody the hassle. As a cyclist in SF, that's what I do, if there isn't already a car stopped at the intersection and/or very clearly arriving there before me. If there's a car starting to cross in front of me, I go behind it. If I'm coming up behind a car who has the right away as they proceed into the intersection, I'm going to piggyback through the intersection with them rather than stopping myself. I feel I'm abiding the spirit of right-of-way if not the letter of the traffic laws.<p>Also I notice that most drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians don't understand right of way to begin with, to the point of making weird and dangerous decisions: drivers stopping midway through an intersection trying to be ""nice"" to some pedestrian or cyclist whose turn it might not be. Dont do it!  Take right of way when you have it. Pedestrians doing the same to motion cars through intersections even as they are in the middle of a crosswalk. Ack!<p>And no the conserving momentum thing is not BS. It's inherent to that mode of transportation. Watch how cyclists navigate stop signs some time. Even when they're more or less obeying the law, very few are coming to a complete stop. Starting and stopping a bike takes much more physical effort than it does a car. Combine that with the vast differences in kinetic energy between them, and I am so much more sympathetic to the cyclist cruising through the stop sign than the car who does the same (and again, actually take note sometime -- cars are as bad about not stopping at stop signs as bikes are).<p>Finally, as a car owner and driver, to other drivers: get over yourselves! You don't need to be in such a hurry. So what if a pedestrian crosses your path or a bike cruises through a stop sign? You have thousands of pounds of heavy machinery at your command. Be happy about that, pat yourself on the back,etc. You've already got a lot to be pleased with. If you need to stop more quickly than you would have liked, all you have to do is press down on that lever on the floor and you're back up to speed. Life is too short to get your blood pressure up about this sort of stuff. And if it does really get to you, maybe you should <i>gasp</i> park it and go for a walk.",1319494097

If A is no longer paged in incrementing its reference count (as a consequence of copying p1 into p2) can cause a page fault.  There's are also gotchas with destroying references such as a collection having to effectively iterate over its contents to decrement each reference count, again possibly leading to additional paging.<p>This assumes an object carries its reference count with it, which every reference counting system I'm aware of does.  I suppose you could technically keep reference counts in a common space, though growing that would be a bit rough.<p>A GC isn't a magic bullet or anything, but they don't need to cause any paging as a result of reference changes until a sweep; and even then, they only need to page in the live set which is more likely to be resident in memory.<p>I'm... skeptical Apple's introduction of ARC is really performance oriented.

I don't know of any European/Asian newspaper that does a better job than the NY Times or WaPo (or for that matter any good regional US paper), for all their faults, and those who are comparable are usually less widely read than the American ones.",1319493657

There are good reasons for occasionally voting for things that are not 100% inline with what your goals are for one particular issue.

At the close today it was 30x earnings and now even lower in after hours trading. I never bought the shares because of the high multiple. However, I believe the current bad news is a blip on the radar in what will continue to be a tremendously successful company. Can someone explain if I'm evaluating Netflix wrong?<p>Others seem all over the map:<p><pre><code>    Apple trades at 14.6x earnings
    Amazon trades at 105x earnings
    Microsoft trades at 9.87x earnings</code></pre>",1319493615

Regarding tactics, I guess it's a matter of knowing your poker hand and trying to put your best foot forward. I can see a point to perhaps doing such a lessened risk with incubator-founded startups, in that the model isn't yet proven of how the average incubator startup can compare to an external team that would have very different dynamics of being processed. It's in an incubator's best interest to make things look good - so the startup gets funding and the incubator's equity becomes more available - though it doesn't mean it was people on the team itself that could have achieved the same, nor that those same resources would continue to be available to the team (or at the same amount) once away from the incubator.",1347108897

I think one of the troubles of learning chinese for a westerner is the difficulty in pronouncing it compared to pronouncing e.g. German. You can't just try to speak it, you need to learn about the tones and the very different sounds. When I started programming Basic as a kid you could just try stuff. You learned as you went. The entry barrier was quite low for someone that was computer literate. However, I find the entry barrier to learning Chinese to be quite high with the pronounciation and difficult characters.

When you're trying to push out frames at 60fps, you generally need to be caching quite a lot of values, for example, ""Get all units that are moving"" or ""Get all units from side x"".<p>The absolute best way to handle this is to start off with safe, conservative functions, that don't cache at all - create a list, iterate over each entity, add whatever fits the condition.<p>Then, after profiling to see what's slow, you hand roll a system that keeps a specific list updated continuously; and then importantly, keep around the old function, and in debug mode compare the lists occasionally (I usually do it every 100th access, so the game is still playable).<p>After that, you may not know what's causing a cached value to go out of sync, but you can at least know it's happening, instead of getting some of the most convoluted and maddening bugs imaginable.

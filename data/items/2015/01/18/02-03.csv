The poster I was replying to mentioned that it was odd that low-quality, uninformed arguments tend to crop up in threads like this a lot. People make broad statements about how evil and nigh-omnipotent the NSA is, and how deeply they&#x27;ve infiltrated every facet of human life. The existence of parallel construction leads to the assumption that every case involving the government is due to parallel construction. Google appears on a PRISM slide, they must be an NSA front company. Someone suggests politics may be more complex than they appear, or the NSA may not be as powerful as they seem, they must be a shill. The US government is involved with NIST and TOR, it means they&#x27;ve completely undermined all forms of encryption and TOR is a honeypot.<p>This subject seems to be a trigger for people to try to outdo each other to come off as cynical and in the know as possible about things which by definition almost no one knows much about.",1421549835

Abandonment and forfeiture as considered therein _do_not_ exist as they are reliant on parts of the USC which no longer exist subsequent to USA ratifying Berne (and the ensuing changes to registration and requirements to affix the © symbol and all that).<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re citing the Berne Convention it seems pretty uncontroversial. Are you suggesting negatives aren&#x27;t a &quot;material form&quot; of fixation for an image? Initially you said:<p>>&quot;<i>Undeveloped film is arguably not a tangible medium suitable for communication</i>&quot; (shawn-butler, <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8905254"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8905254</a>) //<p>Can you point out where TRIPs or the USC requires &quot;suitable for communication&quot;? Better would be to cite current caselaw that discusses this &quot;suitability&quot; clause.<p>>&quot;<i>You can&#x27;t claim copyright on that which is not authorable nor transmittable.. i.e. in a medium that can be copied.</i>&quot; (shawn-butler, above) //<p>These conditions are quite unrelated. You can certainly claim copyright on sculptures, such as the Angel of The North, and on buildings which are not &quot;transmittable&quot; to any useful degree. A &quot;work&quot; is necessarily the product of an author for the purposes of all copyright legislation I&#x27;ve seen as elsewise they are not &quot;works&quot; for the purposes of that legislation. Truism and error by turns.<p>I can create a work by splattering baked-beans on my wall. It&#x27;s authored. It is not transmittable except by secondary reproduction. It can be copied. If you take a print from those beans, by pressing paper on my wall, then you create a (reversed) image which is a derivative work. You may have made a lovely piece of paper and taken great care over making the print but it is I who created the initial work which you &quot;copied&quot; [ie derived your work from]. Whilst you have perhaps acquired a copyright in your print (by your creative production of it, say) it relies on my creative work and so is derivative. You could not lawful sell or reproduce your work without satisfying my conditions for license (until my copyright expires of course).<p>FWIW in the OP the Universal Copyright Convention gives the developer of the photos 10 years of protection as a minimum IIRC for this first publication of the original photographer&#x27;s works.<p>[<i>OT: I&#x27;m sure your arrogant insinuations as to the inexperience of others do not progress the discussion. If there is some material error then IMO you&#x27;d do well to point it out directly rather than insinuate it by way of</i> ad hominem <i>commentary.</i>]",1421547849

However, the one concern I have is that e-ink does not work very fast; browsing the web on a Kindle or Nook leaves a lot to be desired. When you're flipping a page, you can literally watch the ink update.

And the corollary is that every possible performance benefit of non-blocking code is in principle achievable with threaded code, though some of the scheduler may need to be implemented in userland, with more explicit hinting of things like lifetimes of local variables in stack frames, etc., to get there. The true benefit of event-oriented network programming may be simply in what it makes explicit vs implicit. By making the tracking of state awkward, it forces its minimization and consolidation. By a process of Worse is Better, it ends up being more performant for scaling despite (usually) being more awkward to program (especially if you have any kind of nesting or recursion structure in your protocol).",1304811870

They are advertising for the sake of advertising.<p>Commercials on radio/TV/web fund the content you are enjoying. Of course you can flip the channel or have AdBlock or whatever, but you're actively taking revenue away from the creator. You may not have a problem with that (I certainly don't).",1330837122

3662028,comment,3661738,3661738,5,0,athst,,,"I think Readability's model is a little presumptuous.  Why do they get to decide unilaterally that they deserve 30% of the revenue?  It's not like the App Store where you agreed to it.  Given all the work that goes into creating an article, is extracting the text worth 30%?  If I was a publisher, I wouldn't think so.<p>To me, Instapaper's approach is much more straightforward.  You have to have gone to the publisher's site in the first place and seen all of the ads.  You pay a flat fee for the Instapaper app, and can subscribe if you like the service.  Why make it more complicated than it has to be?",1330837052

Yet, we still pay more than we really should and haven't done anything about it.<p>Why? Lobbyists, too many layers of bureaucracy, special interest groups. Take your pick, but at the end of day, it takes a lot of people wanting to do the right thing to make things change. In this country, that's a lot harder to do than most people think.",1330837039
3662026,comment,3661738,3661738,6,0,Steveism,,,"As far as aesthetics go I actually prefer the approach Marco takes with Instapaper. I think Readability does have more of a polished feel but in no way does this polish make the service any more usable. The Instapaper apps are top notch in my book.<p>The moral angle of feeling guilty and thus using Readabilty to compensate authors is total garbage. I disagree with this guilt trip blog post on so many levels. The 30% cut that Readability takes is the whole reason Readability exists. Essentially the writers are providing free content to Readability that they get to make a nice profit on. This is exploiting the writers to a far greater degree than Instapaper. Also, not every article I save I deem worthy of a contribution to the author. I may utterly hate an author's guts and am simply reading their article to better understand their insane philosophies before I decide I despise them. I'll fall back on an old Techdirt term: CwF+RtB. If I like a writer and want to support them I'll visit their site enough to earn them ad impressions, or I'll buy their book, or I purchase something using their affiliate link. I certainly don't need Readability paying people for me while pocketing a handsome chunk of change in the process.",1330836963

I feel very strongly about this, and I agree entirely. I think projects should go one step further. For something like forem, I think it makes sense to have a gem called forem_auth, and for the installer to give you an option to install the engine as a standalone app. If you choose to, it would include the forem_auth gem in the Gemfile, and you'd get auth built in. Otherwise, you configure it for your own auth.<p>I think refinery and spree should adopt identical stances to forem in this regard. I also plan to take this a bit further in all of my engines going forward, and defer the persistence decision entirely, making it trivial to switch out ActiveRecord or mongoid or csv files or whatever. Experimenting with this on internal apps presently, and it shows comically awesome amounts of promise.<p>I think it's a relatively normal thing for lispers to defer decisions like that until they no longer have to decide - that's what we've been doing.
---<p>I've been thinking about rails engine interoperability for quite a while, as have the spree/refinery/other forem guys, and I've got a very solid mental model of what it needs to be to make plug-and-play a possibility with these style components.

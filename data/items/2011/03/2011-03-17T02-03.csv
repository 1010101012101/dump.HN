The biggest reason is that I speak English and am accessible.  They know about me because my blog post on Sunday got widely distributed abroad.  (I suspect many of them follow Jimmy Wales, who retweeted it.)  My blog has working contact information on it.  Also, since the media are pack animals, as soon as anybody quoted me then I was a Certified Expert (TM) and so everybody else should quote me, too.<p>They really <i>should</i> be talking with the guy I talked about in my blog post who actually pushed the button to turn on the warning system at our clients out east.

I would trade a hundred thousand angry emails from people for that.)

But, again, they don't speak English and they're not in reporters' Rolodexes.  Through a quirk set of circumstances, I am.  So when they call and ask ""How much should we be panicking?"" I say ""Don't panic.""  (A radio station wanted my opinion on the likelihood of them getting poisoned by radioactivity from Fukushima half a globe away.  I'm not a nuclear engineer.  Of course I immediately said ""I am not a nuclear engineer, but to put your listeners at ease, that will not happen.""  It's the right answer.

2334830,comment,2333518,2333631,0,0,chadcf,,,"I've used it once, for an app that holds data which was not a good fit for a traditional relational database. The app in question essentially involved collecting data in a web app and then using that data to fill out hundreds of PDF forms. It gets really complicated as the data has to be potentially formatted (say a phone number might need to be split 555-555-5555 on one form but one number per square on another), concatenated (name might need to join first, last mi), as well as data about what page and x/y coordinates things go on for each form.<p>Initial attempts in SQL were painful. The only real way to do it was a key value table, but that gets painful when it comes to formatting for web presence (notably, each document has sections with a group of fields, plus some fields may need to be grouped together such as a series of checkboxes, or parts of a name). So at that point we're looking at writing up XML files to describe the presentation of these 200 forms from a key/value table to the web app.<p>At that point I realized this was doable, but going to be a mess. Enter mongo. Mongo essentially let's us store a dynamic schema of documents. For each form we can stick it all in a single document, as a series of embedded models, with all metadata and values needed in one go. We also get nice revision control within that using mongoid. We can now fetch all the data for a form, as well as save all the data for the form, in one VERY fast atomic operation (we're talking 100-800 field definitions for each form). Having never used mongo, it only took me a few days to implement this complete with handling for all field types and performance was fantastic.<p>Mongo also made it quite easy to populate our data since we're essentially just storing a tree of key and values. We wrote up a tool that loads up the PDF's and let's us draw boxes on top of the fields and set up the metadata, then export that to a YAML file for each form. The YAML is then stored in a tradiational SQL database and is used to create a new form in the system by simply converting it to a nested hash and having mongoid save it. Slick.<p>I'm getting a bit wordy here, but I think it's a great real world example of the type of problem mongo is a good fit for. I wouldn't personally use mongo for something that a relational database is a good fit for, but for something like this it allows you to solve the problem quicker and with significantly less code to maintain (really, the CRUD code for forms is no more than with SQL and probably less since it's only one operation on a document, and my pdf form generator is < 200 lines of ruby).",1300328391

What may be better is ""follow the standard that you are working on"", meaning, don't change coding style because you prefer your own, adopt what is already there, or the norms for a project (e.g. 2 space indents for all that Ruby code we have).",1300327289

I enjoyed the article and appreciate his sleuthing, but his conclusion is completely wrong (at least for major CPC advertisers, who are almost all ROAS-driven) - the biggest advertisers care deeply about their results. I would go so far as to say that the lack of policing of the Overture feed on parked domains was a significant (if not the most significant) issue in Yahoo's poor monetization of search and eventual failure with that product.",1300327221

Now?  It's a hyperbolic, singular phrase that is limited to using the internet as an extension of your operating system without fully explaining or at least detailing for the end user why it matters.<p>Especially in the case of those god.awful Microsoft commercials.  In their case, the way it's presented, the cloud is nothing less synonymous with social networking.  Change your Facebook status from Windows?  That's the cloud.  Upload a picture to Flickr?  That's the cloud.  It's no better than that phase of 'web 2.0' that was nothing more than superficial design elements that included shiny buttons, dropping vowels and slapping the term 'beta' on everything.  The web is cyclical and this is the latest cycle.<p>While that in and of itself isn't BAD per se, it's a phrase that's come synonymous with ""rockstar"" and ""ninja"" when talking about hiring developers.

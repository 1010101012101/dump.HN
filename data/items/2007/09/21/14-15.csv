Outside of research, it's people unlike us, so what do we know about them? Pretty much nothing. Additionally, what IT manager at a solid company is going to buy the ""el cheapo"" (pg's phrase) solution when there are guys from Sun telling him/her ""Just buy our system, and if anything bad happens, we'll fix it, and you won't lose your job.""<p>BTW, the RSA Factoring Challenge has been over for some time: <a href=""http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2092"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2092</a>. <p>But back to my first point, what else - besides trying to factor big numbers - would I/you/a-20-something-hacker do with a big distributed network? I can't think of anything.",1190385786

So far as I could tell, it's only an essay if you write about how your parents were alcoholics, how you were beaten as a child, or how you live with a terrible illness. Needless to say no one liked the stuff I wrote and I didn't do very well. ",1190383876

57936,comment,57868,57918,0,0,Goladus,,,"Funny thing... the other day I tried converting some Lisp to Python as a demonstration, and discovered that the number of parens you get to remove depends largely on the programming style you're using.  Mostly, they just get shifted around or replaced with brackets (or braces), and you have to add a lot of commas.<p>If you scan over <a href=""http://norvig.com/python-lisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/python-lisp.html</a>, you'll see a lot of opportunities to remove parens; but in fact many of those are not semantically identical.<p>In python, a block does not return a value.  <p><p><p><pre><code>    if a:f(x);else:g(y)\n</code></pre>\nIf you wanted it to return a value, you'd have to rewrite 'if' as a function and say something like:  <p><p><p><pre><code>     myif(a, [(f, x)], [(g, y)])\n</code></pre>\nIf you wanted to evolve python towards Lisp without having to add parens, I'd make it so indented blocks are actually expressions and automatically return a value to the defining block.<p>(Of course, the normal python way is to use ""return"" statements or side-effects, rather than writing an ad-hoc version of the lisp 'if')",1190383589

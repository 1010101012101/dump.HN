Antibiotics would have reduced the mortality of the 1918 flu, which was novel at the time, drastically as bacterial infection counted for the majority of deaths.<p>We are likely to have a decent universal vaccine within the decade. Example, one test by Inovio used a unmatched vaccine on the 1918 Flu with lethal dose in mice. All the controls died but none of the vaccinated. This type of vaccine would reduce the chance greatly that something like a bat flu would emerge without us being prepared. These universal vaccines are made by bacteria or other very fast to produce and cheap methods, compared to the popular egg method today.<p>The biggest issue which the WHO has been working on is to make sure poorer countries have the know-how and distribution networks to ensure they can make and deliver current and next gen vaccines. This is especially important if access to antibiotics is not common and easy.",1368312948

5692413,comment,5686492,5691909,1,0,astral303,,,"Just like with Mongo or any NoSQL/non-traditional solution, you have to understand how the trade-offs and capabilities of the database relate to what you're using the database for. You also have to design your data storage with these tradeoffs in mind.<p>For example, joins. There are no joins in Mongo or Cassandra and anything working around joins is simply not going to be as fast as a traditional database's join. If you need to do joins all the time, you will be in pain. So the answer is to deduplicate your data, such that joins are not necessary for frequent operations.<p>In particular, with Cassandra, while it's great at many things, such as write speed and write availability, you have to be very careful with your data design to get the results that you need. And you have to be cognizant about the querying that you need to do.<p>Cassandra has really weak in-store aggregation and filtering, as in there is almost no in-store aggregation and there is no filtering other than by a prefix of a column or a key (prefixed subset). So if your column names are made out of a composite parts A:B:C, you can scan for A:* or A:B:* (or A:[some value of B to some other value of B]), but you can't do <i>:B:</i> or *:B:C.<p>The advanced trick is to use ordered rows, which are so strongly discouraged (because you can shoot yourself in the foot with a key distribution hotspot), which allows you another axis of prefixed subset filtering. But only one more axis.<p>Sorting? Cassandra doesn't sort. Cassandra project leadership thinks that sorting should be done in the client. If you want to filter a subset of keys in the shape of A:B:C, e.g. get all keys of a certain value of A and sort B:C, you have to do the sorting yourself. If you wanted to do a top-N report, you have to retrieve all that data to your client and then sort.<p>The only sorting in Cassandra is the hierarchical column (and optionally key) ordering. So if you want to have quick top-N reporting functionality on values A and B from an A:B data tuple, you end up maintaining two indices (i.e. precomputing query results). One such index has columns that start with A and another starts with B.<p>But then the indexing support is particularly weak. Secondary indexing is only done on values, so if you want to index portions of your keys, that's not natively supported. Also, only in Cassandra 1.2 is indexing finally ""write-only,"" instead of ""read-then-write."" (Write-only performance is much faster.)<p>There are no triggers, so you can't write custom indices where you can atomically perform ""read-then-write"" operations to maintain an index. Instead, you have to write all such custom indexing logic yourself and take a hit for the transmission of all the indexing mutations over the network wire. This hurts particularly bad when you have a cluster distributed over geographical regions (i.e. slow/expensive link).<p>Cassandra does have the ability to count the number of columns, but only in one row (w/ only the same prefixed subset filtering available). Counting columns in multiple rows is not available, even if these rows are co-located on the same node.<p>Map-reduce is available, but it is not suitable for frequent queries (not meant to be run quickly, just like map-reduce in Mongo is not something you want to be hitting very frequently).<p>So, of course, whether these are issues for you depends entirely on your data design. There are many things that Cassandra does well and certain data shapes for which it is just diesel. It's quite ops-friendly, rolling full-uptime upgrades are reliable and are a key priority for the Cassandra team.<p>So Cassandra is even more specialized in terms of its uses than Mongo. If the original author of the presentation tried to use Cassandra for the same kind of data he used for Mongo, he probably would've written an even more scathing article.",1368312673

However, it really doesn't suit my way of learning or using the editor. Unfortunately it's similar with available tutorials and other resources.<p>While the docs are really impressive in terms of coverage, they are both structured in a way I don't like and use far too many words for descriptions of single thing. They are intended as a book, not as a cheat sheet, and I strongly prefer the latter.<p>The docs assume no prior knowledge about anything related to editing text. That makes it discuss many boring and not that important things and the problem is that one has no way of knowing at a high level which chapter will be important and which won't.<p>That's also true for tutorial, which makes a huge undertaking from learning to jump to the beginning of next word. That's ok for someone who used notepad earlier, but irritating for me.<p>Whatever cheat sheet-like tutorials there are, they are incomplete instead. I would like to have a list of all possible commands and elisp functions in one flat document. There is probably no such document or at least I wasn't able to find it.<p>And then there's an issue with some of the Emacs users, who are a bit more enthusiastic than they should. It's not hard to find answers that say that what someone wants is not the emacs way and that it should stop wanting it. A page or two down the thread there is code posted, no doubt, but that somewhat kills the pleasure of learning.<p>In short: I prefer short references in the cheat sheet format for learning an editor. Instead of grouping by topic, such reference should group by importance. There is probably nothing like that in Emacs docs or other materials. I guess that interactive game or tutorial would be like that, because probably the most used shortcuts for the game would be the most important ones. And so I asked.",1368311454

Python is no longer a small language.<p>Also, there is a lot of machinery behind Enums (killing a mosquito with a cannon).  So, we should expect that people will hack it, abuse it, twist it into knots, subclass it, invent tricks will it, develop funky idioms, etc.  IMO, none of this is worth it.  The ""problem"" wasn't that important to begin with.<p>That said, the discussion is moot.  There is no need to defend the proposal any more.  Guido has accepted the PEP and it will enter the language, for better or for worse.<p>If we had to have a Enum, the one that was accepted was a reasonable choice.  For the most part, the discussion did a nice job of considering existing recipes, possible use cases, and being as Pythonic as possible.<p>My only criticism of the process is that handful of enthusiasts (Eli, Ethan, Barry, etc) launched an avalanche of implementation and api-choice emails that buried and ignored the posts suggesting the language would be better-off without Enum.

I would also increase the density of my HTML to cover for all the possible cases, and give the developers some flexibility.<p>As a front-end developer only working on HTML and CSS, keeping content and style completely seperate is the goal I aim for everytime I start a new project. But maintaining such a division is hard when working with developers because they generally don't touch the CSS at all. So I need to provide styling directly into the HTML because that's what developers generate and have their hands on. I don't blame the working process for making me write a different kind of CSS. It's just how it has to be done. Neither type of CSS is better than the other: they are just suited for 2 different situations.<p>And that's why I don't believe there is a perfect way to write CSS. There are useful tricks and smart shortcuts but, although having been a dedicated front-ender for 4 years with no programming skills, I don't think CSS is meant to be discussed too thoroughly.",1368309786

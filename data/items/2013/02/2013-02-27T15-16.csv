The CMS market is entirely different from the custom web application market. Most web sites run on some form of content management system: Day CQ5, SiteCore, Typo3, OpenText, Umbraco, ExpressionEngine, WordPress, Drupal, DotNetNuke, eZ, epiServer and so on. This is a huge market.<p>People who make the above comparison seem to be guys that have started web development with Drupal or Wordpress, and progressed to create ever more complex solutions over time. Then later they discover Rails. Congratulations.<p>I'm of the opinion, that ultimately, all CMS suck in one way or another, I hate them with a passion, but compared to most, Drupal is a shining beacon of light and reason. Seriously.<p>From a financial perspective, custom web applications usually do not make sense for businesses who want a complex web site. Most companies are also hesitant to shell out 200k+ on an untested, custom made piece of software developed by a small company. Compared to that, a SiteCore solution with its 60k license looks cheaper and more reliable.",1361980743

There was a giant legacy MyISAM (this becomes important later) table with lots of imported data. One day, I made some trivial looking migration (added a flag column to that table). I tested it locally, rolled it out to staging server. Everything seemed A-OK until we started migration on the production server. Suddenly, everything broke. By everything, I mean EVERYTHING, our web application showed massive 500-s, total DEFCON1 across the whole company. It turned out we ran out of disk space, since apparently myisam tables are altered the following way: first the table is created with updated schema, then it is populated with data from the old table. MyISAM ran out of disk space and somehow corrupted the existing tables, mysql server would start with blank tables, with all data lost.<p>I can confirm this very feeling: ""The implications of what I'd just done didn't immediately hit me. I first had a truly out-of-body experience, seeming to hover above the darkened room of hackers, each hunched over glowing terminals."" Also, I distinctly remember how I shivered and my hands shook.

There are very few organizations that actually promote based on excellence. Most set up a war of attrition based on shared suffering and the mountain of pointless work generated by bike-shedding executives. People with depression (or anxiety, ADD, panic, etc.) are not intentionally excluded; they're just the first to crack. Ugly fact: it's how the system is <i>supposed</i> to work. Competition-on-suffering exists to filter out ""the weak"" and ""the slackers"". It's a millennia-old (wrong) mentality of work and only over the past 50 years have we understood the biological causes (<i>not</i> personal weakness) that actually make people drop.<p>The idea is to assess character by generating artificial stress, but the result is that mild (usually treatable) biological problems are misinterpreted as character flaws. Depression is read as lassitude. (It's not.) Panic is seen as ""not handling pressure well."" (Actually, a panic attack is 3-20 minutes of hell but the disorder does not impair judgment.) Overwork-induced social ineptitude is interpreted as selfishness. Et cetera.<p>This setup is sad, stupid, wrong, and counterproductive because the modern economy doesn't <i>need</i> pointless effort and tolerance of suffering. Slackers are no more harmful than misdirected hard workers (which is most, because the people providing direction in most organizations are clueless yes-men). What the world needs, now, are creativity, insight, and excellence, which turn out to be positively correlated with the propensity to depression.<p>The conformist idiocy and pointless sacrifice of corporate life are unhealthy for normal people and debilitating for many with depression. VC-istan, a very volatile form of corporate life that <i>looks</i> meritocratic, is worse... because people work too hard and personalize their failures.<p>What I'd like to see over the next 15 years is more of an ability for smart, capable people to start lifestyle businesses. Right now, it's not unreasonably hard to found a get-big-or-die VC-istan company if you have the connections, but there's a whole world of smaller businesses that's not being explored because the market to connect the resources with the talent doesn't exist yet.

I agree completely. In light of recent developments like <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5285627"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5285627</a> you might say that his views are becoming better more widely accepted, even if their history is not acknowledged. In <i>Computer Lib</i> Nelson advocated what we today might call a ""Wikipedia"" or ""Khan Academy"" model of education. I'll allow myself to post an extended quotation from his reaction to dialogue-based learning systems because I find the entire thing fascinating and terribly prescient (keep in mind that this was published in 1974):<p><i>""The alternative is straightforward. Instead of devising
elaborate systems permitting the computer or its
instructional contents to control the situation, why not
permit the student to control the system, show him how to
do so intelligently, and make it easy for him to find his own
way? Discard the sequences, items and conversation, and
allow the student to move freely through materials which he
may control. Never mind optimizing reinforcement or
validating teaching sequences. Motivate the user and let him
loose in a wonderful place.</i><p><i>Let the student control the sequence, put him in control of
interesting and clear material, and make him feel good
comfortable, interested, and autonomous. Teach him to
orient himself: not having the system answer questions, all
typed in, but allowing the student to get answers by looking
in a fairly obvious place. (Dialogue is unnecessary even when
it does not intrude.) Such ultra-rich environments allow the
student to choose what he will study, when he will study it
and how he will study it, and to what criteria of
accomplishment he will aim. Let the student pick what he
wishes to study next, decide when he wishes to be tested,
and give him a variety of interesting materials, events and
opportunities. Let the student ask to be tested on what he 
thinks he knows, when he is ready, selecting the most
appropriate form of testing available.</i><p><i>This approach has several advantages. First, it
circumvents the incredible obstacles created by the
dialogue-item-sequence philosophy. It ends the danger to
students of bugs in the material. And last, it does what
education is supposed to dofoster student enthusiasm,
involvement, and self-reliance.</i><p><i>Under such circumstances students will actually be
interested, motivated to achieve far more than they have
ever achieved within the normal instructional framework;
and any lopsidedness which may result will be far offset by
the degree of accomplishment which will occurit being
much better to create lopsided but enthusiastic genius
specialists than listless, apathetic, or cruelly rebellious
mediocrities. If they start soon enough they may even reach
adulthood with natural minds: driven by enthusiasm and
interest, crippled in no areas, eager to learn more, and far
smarter than people ordinarily end up being.</i><p><i>Enthusiasm and involvement are what really count. This is
why the right to explore far outweighs any administrative
advantages of creating and enforcing subjects and
curriculum sequences. The enhancement of motivation that
will follow from letting kids learn anything they want to
learn will far outweigh any specialization that may result. By
the elimination or benign replacement of both curriculum
and tests in an ultra-rich environment, we will prevent the
attrition of the natural motivation of children from its
initially enormous levels, and mental development will be
the natural straight diagonal rather than the customary
parabola.""</i>",1361979885

Kids in China don't grow up watching English language TV, movies and listening to music sung in English. English aren't taught until high school. Even if they have the talent, tenacity and resources to learn English really really well. They have nothing to talk about with people from the rest of world because they simply lack a common cultural context. This tremendously inhibits English learning in China.<p>With the lack of access to good language reference materials, very often the only way for the Chinese to learn anything tech is to read books, mags and blogs that translate technical materials from the outside world. While books translated are often in good quality as far as fidelity goes, magazines and blogs are not so much so. Even when they are translated properly, there are only so many people capable of translating them, and they only understand so much that they are translating. The number of materials available in Chinese is extremely limited, and when they are available in English, they are translated 6 months to years late. 6 months is a very long time in tech.<p>Education is also lacking. Very very very few secondary schools teach programming. Universities are better, and some do teach good fundamental theories. As far as programming languages though, I suppose even if you are educated in the US, you probably still have to catch up as soon as you graduate.

The only ones who stay are the ones who truly love what they are doing, but there are only so many of them around, so the chances for you to be mentored by an expert is low.<p>All the odds are against you for you ascending to a world-class programmer in China.<p>On the bright side, you do see a lot of semi-popular README files on Github and NPM that's written completely in Chinese, so it seems that they are figuring out things their own way, in their own language, sharing with they own people.<p>Now onto Hong Kong. HK is actually quite similar to China with the major exception that the GFW doesn't exist in HK and command in English is generally good enough to communicate with the outside world. Technical materials are readily available and are often read first hand. Education though, is the same story as China, though the problem where the brightest kids don't go into engineering and CS is even more pronounced in HK due to our economic structure. Low pay, suits throwing around charts etc. Same thing. Less fragmented tech groups in HK. We do talk to other tech groups and startup groups a lot, but not enough local participants just the same.

Erlang is the best choice if you're interested in concurrency and distributed programming. It's also in a sweet spot where variables are bound once, which forces you to change the way you think. I consider this more important than purity for learning.<p>Haskell is probably the biggest paradigm shift. I use it a lot and love it. It really does change the way you think, but it is also the steepest learning curve.<p>Of all the Lisps, Scheme is the simplest and tends to be used functionally more often than Common Lisp. There is an incredible wealth of resources for people learning Scheme, but especially The Little Schemer and Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP). I have never made much progress in my copy of SICP, but I got a lot out of the Little Schemer. I said to avoid JVM languages but Clojure is the most modern Lisp, and incorporates a lot of modern functional programming idioms, so it can sometimes have a Haskellish flavor, and it doesn't make circumventing FP all that easy. It's probably the best Lisp of today.<p>Standard ML and OCaml are both good if it looks to you like Haskell goes too far but in the right direction. OCaml is considered more pragmatic; it's also more widely available and benefits from being a single-implementation language. Standard ML is arguably a more beautiful language, but it suffers from low library availability. Both will encourage functional-style programming, but both provide a fair number of escape hatches. For example, they're not pure and they both have ""refs"" that let you circumvent variables-as-bindings. But they encourage the style.<p>I tried many times with Lisp and eventually concluded it just wasn't for me, and Haskell is a better fit. I personally recommend looking at Erlang, Clojure and Haskell, and just throwing yourself into whichever one of them looks ""cool"" to you. If the language feels unpleasant to you, there's no point in trying to force yourself to go further, but if it seems fun to you, you'll make progress without as much effort.",1361979410

5292775,comment,5291673,5292542,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"I have two minds about the depression/startup debate.<p>First, I'm going to make a blanket statement. People with depression are, as a group, better people. Sure, there are bad people with depression and good people without it but, in the aggregate, people who have suffered through it tend to be more empathetic and less mean-spirited. You're not likely to kick those who are down if you've <i>been</i> down. If you've had a 3-month spell in which everything took a massive amount of effort, you're not likely to inject annual ""low performer"" witch hunts into a company (cf. Enron, Google) for shits and giggles. So, it might get good for VC-istan to be more accepting of neuro-diversity. People with mild depression are also less prone to the absurd optimistic bias that plagues the ecosystem (depressive realism). People like that shouldn't be excluded just because they're the first to crack in this absurd brogrammer pressure-cooker that actually results in an extremely low quality of work across the board.<p>Finally, business formation doesn't <i>have</i> to be an all-consuming, destroys-your-life-if-it-doesn't-work-out-and-merely-ruins-it-if-it-does, affair. Our natural tendency, as humans, is to examine and improve things. For many of us, that includes abstract processes. That's kind of what business formation is... or at least where it starts. It's too natural and important of a process for it to exclude people who can't lay down a 5000-hour work year. It's a 90-hour-per-week, all-consuming affair in VC-istan, but maybe the problem is that ecosystem and not business formation (a millennia-old, natural process) itself.<p>On the other hand, there is currently no way for most people to start businesses that <i>isn't</i> unhealthy. Bank loans expect personal liability. VC-istan's problems are well-documented; VC's can ruin your reputation and make you unemployable <i>and</i> unfundable, so they hold all the cards. Using personal savings isn't a good idea in a world where full-time employment is taxing enough to exclude almost everyone over 65. Using friends-and-family money is even worse, because it can interfere with the personal relationships people need to be healthy. Then, in the U.S., there is the evil of private health insurance.<p>Obviously, I'm not saying that business formation should be entirely risk-less, but right now, there's no healthy way for most people to do it. Most people don't have the capital, relationships, and leeway.<p>I wish there <i>were</i> a healthy way for people who are inclined toward business formation to do it, and maybe that's the real problem we should be out solving.",1361978848

And, importantly, he developed them as a self-described <i>fan</i> of computers, not as someone who disliked them, as many technology-critical writers do.<p>He was around when personal computers were just becoming available, and was keen on trying to ensure that regular people could harness their power for their own ends. His cynicism about ""technology"" as an industry and culture always seemed tinged with a utopian optimism about computers themselves, as encapsulated in his slogan, ""You can and must understand computers NOW"". So he was against the ""tekkies"", but not against computation, if regular people could get their hands on its power, bypassing the ""computer priesthood"" operating as gatekeepers.<p>Here's something he wrote in 1974, in <i>Computer Lib</i> (unfortunately out of print, but there's an excerpt reprinted at <a href=""http://www.newmediareader.com/book_samples/nmr-21-nelson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newmediareader.com/book_samples/nmr-21-nelson.pdf</a>):<p>> <i>Any nitwit can understand computers, and many do. Unfortunately, due to ridiculous historical circumstances, computers have been made a mystery to most of the world. And this situation does not seem to be improving. You hear more and more about computers, but to most people its just one big blur. The people who know about computers often seem unwilling to explain things or answer your questions. Stereotyped notions develop about computers operating in fixed waysand so confusion increases. The chasm between
laymen and computer people widens fast and dangerously.</i><p>> <i>This book is a measure of desperation, so serious and
abysmal is the public sense of confusion and ignorance. Anything with buttons or lights can be palmed off on the laymen as a computer. There are so many different things, and their differences are so important; yet to the lay public they are lumped together as computer stuff, indistinct and beyond understanding or criticism.

While it was only sold in China and has since long been discontinued, it is an amazing device for me and tracking my life and my projects. What the device is basically boils down to a Wacom digitizer laid over a black and white screen with a Linux kernel powering the backend (and Qt powering the front-end). While it was still supported, it offered automatic uploads of your files to Evernote, though it has not been updated since Evernote changed their sign-in process so this no longer works. It does have a micro SD card slot and an incredibly old version of Firefox (Firefox 2 I think). Since it is a Wacom tablet, you can rest your hands on the screen all you want, and the screen is textured so it feels almost like writing on paper. It can also be plugged into a PC and act as a Wacom digitizer on your screen for Photoshop, OneNote, or anything else you need to use a pen for.<p>Unfortunately it was never sold outside of China and was quickly discontinued. Other markets got the Asus PadFone instead, which was more expensive and not nearly as simple as a digital notepad. What you describe (a notebook, with lament over collaboration) could be solved with a well-supported device like the EeeNote. It truly is as flexible and limitlessly creative as a pen and paper [1].

Back in 2012, the contract between HBO and the cable providers was up for renegotiation. HBO wanted to turn HBO Go into a standalone service; the cable companies basically said that if HBO were to do that, they would drop HBO.

I have no reason to save up to get the other seasons if they're sitting on my hardrive in blue-ray quality. So they still lose something once all is tallied<p>First thing: it's been shown that music pirates spend more on music than non pirates. Clearly, having something for free doesn't prevent people from paying for it. People like having stuff in their collection, they like extra features, and they like supporting the creators of quality stuff if they can afford it. They also like being able to watch something when it comes out rather than waiting for it to come out on a box set.<p>Second thing: The second season box set of GoT costs $40. Most people are simply never going to pay that price, regardless of whether piracy is an option; in that case, they simply wouldn't ever see it. If those people torrent it, there's no sale opportunity lost.",1361977737

Corporate life, for most people in most organizations, <i>is depressing</i>. All of it, whether it's a startup or some dead-end subordinate position at a Fortune 500, is pretty awful. The natural human tendency toward work has been perverted through subordination, inadequate rewards, wasted efforts, and capricious evaluation.<p>The difference is that the former is often all-consuming, while the latter tends to be, although miserable, limited in scope. If you tend toward depression, you're more likely to have it flare up in a 90-hour VC-istan gig than a 40-hour corporate job.<p>The problem isn't that business formation itself is detrimental, but that VC-istan is an ecosystem where (a) economic life dominates a person's existence, crowding out everything else, and (b) there's extreme volatility with no safety net. If you're a grunt, your startup might acqui-fail and dump you into a subordinate position that makes no sense, or you might get fired on day 364 with no severance and no equity because of the ""cliff"". If you're a founder, your investors hold all the cards and you're just there to do the legwork until you burn out and fall to pieces (and will then be replaced either with one of their friends, or another young, clueless, idiot).<p>It's not startups that are the problem, though.

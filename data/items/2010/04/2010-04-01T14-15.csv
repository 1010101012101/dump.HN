1234691,story,,,45,33,matrix,"Ask HN: Bootstrapping a Startup Alone",,"For reasons beyond the scope of this question, I must move to the Salt Lake City area within the next 3 months<i></i>. I'm looking forward to this move, but it puts me in an interesting situation, and I feel the HN collective will have some interesting insight and advice to offer.<p>First, a little background about me so we have some context: I am not a US citizen. I will have a green card in about 18 months, but meanwhile if I work, the employer must sponsor me for a visa.<p>This makes me nearly unemployable. The number of employers willing to deal with the visa process is vanishingly small, consequently there are very few -- if any -- jobs available to me. An additional complication is that I am ""too experienced"" for many jobs. I have a Masters degree (Software Engineering) about 12 years experience working on commercial software products. In recent years my career has been focused on management/technical leadership roles. That's no accident. I wanted that experience because I have a strong entrepreneurial streak and want to involved in the business side of things. I love that stuff.<p>However, I'm also passionate about building web products. I code for fun. I'm a geek, and I get a kick out of building cool stuff. I have no interest in being a middle management drone. I'd much rather starve and build something cool with a group of passionate people. I think a lot of people on HN are like that.<p>I'm thinking my unemployable status might in fact be an opportunity. My wife will be making enough money that we can get by with just her salary. She is happy to support me if I decide to invest my time into building something that has the potential to be turned into a startup when I am legally permitted to.<p>I always have a few ideas that I'm thinking about, working on, etc and now is no exception. I'm thinking this might be an opportunity to iteratively build prototypes and get market/customer validation for something that I can then really launch once I have a green card.<p>My questions: Is this something that's viable to do, in your experience? I don't have a professional network in Utah, so at least initially I will be alone on this - and in fact will have to be, since I cannot legally start a business. Also, does anyone have any advice as to how I might build a professional network of like-minded people when I'm in a situation like this? I have the social side of things covered (I participate in a lot of outdoor sports).<p><i></i> I'm happy to elaborate further, I just wanted to keep this question short and to the point.",1270133112

1234688,comment,1230861,1230972,0,0,tokenadult,,,"A friend from the school (a parent) kindly asked me by personal email in what capacity I wrote the parent comment here. I should make clear that I was (and am) writing in my individual capacity as one parent among a few hundred in a start-up school community. My opinions are my own, and are surely not shared by all other parents of students at the school. I see from the several typos in the parent post that I was in vent mode, typing rapidly to express disagreement with the article that opened the thread.<p>That said, I have been puzzled by the lack of pan-school online community for the parents and for the students at the EPGY Online High School, because there are numerous examples of thriving communities of that kind elsewhere in cyberspace. Evidently (according to personal accounts I have heard from other students and news reports I have read) it is quite routine at most online high schools to subscribe all students to a pan-school online community as soon as they enroll. The asynchronous online community allows students with varied schedules to make friends and share interests--just as Hacker News does. An asynchronous online community is an especially important social help for a school in which school classes are conducted by synchronous video links just a few hours per week, and all the more so if the school has students from all over the world living in every which time zone.<p>I am a big proponent of online interaction even for communities who regularly interact face-to-face. For example, I am a Yahoo Groups listowner for groups that link my local homeschooling support group since 2003 (more than 100 members) and our statewide gifted education parent advocacy group since 2005 (about 500 members). The online groups massively increase the helpfulness of the face-to-face interaction the families in each organization have, and of course tend to promote more face-to-face meet-ups as opportunities arise. They facilitate sharing information and encouragement and guarantee that official communications from each group will be understood and mutually discussed right away.<p>Similarly, my son is in dual-enrollment classes at our state flagship university, and thus inherently meets some classmates face-to-face each day (especially in his foreign language classes). Yet the overall dual-enrollment program makes mandatory for students and optional (highly encouraged) for parents to sign up for an email list through which to receive official program announcements. Most of my son's individual classes also make very effective use of email and announcements posted on websites (our state flagship university has numerous ongoing human-computer interaction studies) and some of his hardest classes make formal use of web forums for student discussion of the content of the class. This deepens both the intellectual life and community spirit of those classes. I need not mention here that HN is fun even for hackers who know one another in person in offline life. I expected such a vital online community when we signed up for the founding class of the online high school we know from its inception, but that community has yet to be formed.<p>I suppose most parents make most such comparisons based on locally available resources. Certainly other parents think that EPGY Online High School is their best current bundle of trade-offs for their children's education. I think my town has both better homeschooling support groups and better public and private high schools than most places in the United States--better by test, as can be confirmed in quite a few cases. College admission for homeschoolers is a solved problem,<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html</a><p>as I have known since my oldest son was an infant, so I was never the least bit worried about college admission prospects for a ""purist"" homeschooled child. We sought out the new online high school from Stanford because of previous good experiences using Ã  la carte distance learning courses<p><a href=""http://epgy.stanford.edu/courses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://epgy.stanford.edu/courses/</a><p>to supplement his homeschooling, and because he and I both have a spirit of risk-taking and a willingness to try something new with little track record. But with the benefit of hindsight, for us in our local environment, it would have better to have him enrolled at Brand X local high school through our state's open enrollment statute, and to continue to do just one or two distance learning classes on the side, before going full-time for university dual-enrollment for eleventh and twelfth grade. Reasonable minds can differ, because different families live in different communities, but my disagreement with the author of the interesting submitted article is that I don't think all online high schools have yet figured out how to be significantly better (in social aspects as well as intellectual aspects) than locally available public or private schools in most parts of the United States. I like to support the school that my family participates in by urging it to be the best that it can be.",1270133055

They are so few and far between that you'd be hard pressed to find a developer who had had an app rejected. Also in my experience the ""app store gatekeepers"" have been far from capricious and in fact rather sensible. And unlike less than a year ago, now Apple are proactive in communicating with developers - detailed information what issues they've found (including things like screenshots and even suggestions how the issue can be solved), follow up ID, contact information (including phone) of a person that can answer any further questions you might have, etc.<p>In short, if you are reasonable (e.g. not trying to sneak in a porn app or an app that obviously violates Apple's terms) you are practically guaranteed that you'll get your app in the store. And if you are not reasonable being big or close to Apple will likely not help you much.<p>(By the way, I cannot come up with a single case in which ngmoco might seem to have bypassed the approval process.

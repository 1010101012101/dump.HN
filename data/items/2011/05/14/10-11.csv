Nobody actually uses the legacy instructions that are ""decoded into RISC-like microops"" except people writing 4K demos.  In reality, ARM instructions are actually <i>longer on average, and more complex on average</i>.  Nor is this a bad thing: it means that ARM IPC is more valuable than x86 IPC.<p>ARM's advantage is that their instructions are longer, more complex, and easier to decode: not that they're ""simpler and more RISC-like"".  RISC, at least in its original sense, is as dead as a doornail.",1305370776

2547474,comment,2547375,2547375,19,0,nagrom,,,"The question is unnecessarily emotional and anthropomorphizes smallpox - smallpox hates that. The question is really ""There is a threat contained in labs in the US and Russia. Should we eliminate it, or hold onto it for future research and as a backup for vaccinations in case of other, undeclared stocks?"" This breaks down into a whole set of questions, I guess.<p>What is the probability of the virus escaping from the labs in Georgia and Siberia? What is the probability that there are undeclared stocks of the virus elsewhere? If the second is greater than the first, don't destroy the stocks because you may need them to recreate the vaccine. If the second is less than the first, by how much? And what is the consensus on risk appetite? How well can you ensure that the stocks really are destroyed if they are so ordered to be?<p>This should tell you the best answer based on safety.<p>The next set of questions relate to what can be learned from the current stocks. Is there an active research program? Is there a current list of things to learn, or are we just holding onto it 'in case'? Has there been a case that we were glad to have virus stocks that were previously held to be useless?<p>If there is no obvious gain from holding onto the stock for research and the most significant threat from the virus is accidental release, then destroy the stocks. Otherwise, hold onto them - you can't recreate the stocks from nothing yet and you can always destroy them later.<p>My gut tells me that we should hold onto them. I'm always loathe to throw opportunities away and that's really what these stocks represent.",1305370613

Lots of people aren't web-savvy enough copy and paste both pieces and for those who are that savvy it's a hug nuisance.  So a URL shortener makes it much more likely that people will go read whatever you posted by removing those issues.  I shared a URL shortening service with someone who routinely posted articles to a list we both belonged to and she was thrilled to pieces and has used it consistently ever since.",1305369776

For one, that adds all sorts of dependencies (the internet, central service, etc. have to be up for the unlock command to work).   For another, what if there is a security compromise of the central server?<p>I'd much rather have a system where the lock uses an NFC sensor and a CPU, and it works with phones that have NFC.  Yes, you wouldn't be able to do remote revocation (you'd have to be standing in front of the lock to send an updated CRL), but it would be a lot more secure, and it avoids dependence on a central server.",1305367342

It's more about tweaking that DB query, smartly packaging the assets or using a better algorithm.</i><p>That's because you constrain your use of Python in I/O bound problems, like webpages and such. If you had any CPU bound problems, then you would have found Python is quite slow -- and you can get 2-20-100 times the performance in another language.<p>Python is very slow (compared to what it can be), which is what necessitates tons of workarounds like: C extensions, SWIG, NumPy and SciPy (C, Fortran, etc), Cython, PyPy, etc. A whole cottage industry around Python's slowness. Which is nice to exist, but not an ideal solution: suddenly you have 2 codebases to manage in 2 different languages, makefiles, portability issues, etc etc. All of those are barriers to entry.",1365936140

It got several ""thumbs up"", was actually useful, didn't change the API and had test coverage. I put a lot of time into making it nice and clean, in my opinion a perfect pull request. Two years later they closed it with a comment saying one of the more senior contributors added code that did what my code did (except 2 years later) so mine wasn't necessary anymore. They never merged my changes.<p>Objectively I can say what they did was cold but logical in the end, since it incorporated the change better into how they saw the next version of the library and they can trust the more senior contributor more. Subjectively it really hurt. It was one of my first contributions to open source and it definitely unmotivated me to do any others. It was in limbo for 2 years until they finally implemented it in another way, instead of just accepting the pull request for now until they could change it.<p>I don't hold a grudge against the people involved since I've used their code a lot and am thankful for their indirect help using their libraries.

Yes, relying on the government for handouts isn't going to work, and you also want to be careful of welfare dependence.

Increasing that limit will require a hard fork that breaks all existing clients. A chunk of the community and at least one of the developers is really hostile to the idea, partly because it increases resource usage - every node needs to receive every single transaction and store it forever. At the current, fairly low, transaction rate limit that's 52 gigabytes of new transactions every year.<p>The other reason is that they feel that, without transaction rate limits, mining won't be profitable when the rate of coin subsidy drops off. Some argue that we need the competition for limited block space in order to drive fees up enough to keep mining profitable. Those same fees kill microtransactions.<p>Since a hard fork would require agreement from essentially everyone involved in Bitcoin, there's essentially no chance of this limit being increased.",1365935051

I would say at this point, small brick and mortar businesses are the most viable market target for a product like this.<p>Additionally, it might be worth investing a small sum to recreate the UXD,  or at minimum reduce the use of gradients and move toward a more simplistic approach graphically.

5546505,comment,5545625,5546112,15,0,vidarh,,,"> Then you're not actually performing performance analysis. Python is S-L-O-W.<p>You totally miss the point. There are large classes of systems where CPU time in <i>your app</i> is not a significant factor. E.g. my go-to example of this is the first Ruby project I deployed in a production environment:<p>A queueing middleware server. If we served the queues entirely out of memory we could serve a few million messages a day out of 10% of a single 2005-era Xeon core (and while Ruby doesn't scale across cores, this system could easily spread load by simply running multiple queue processes).But of of that 10%, 90% was spent in kernel space. So even if switching to C (or whatever) were to speed up the user-space part of the code 90%, it would only cut CPU time spent from 10% to 9.1%.<p>This is fairly typical. If your code is CPU-bound, and it's not CPU bound because of stupid algorithm choices, then things can look very different. The first thing to do is find out if you're CPU or IO bound.",1365933760

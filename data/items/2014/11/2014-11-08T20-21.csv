8578124,comment,8576843,8577047,0,0,pingec,,,"I am of a similar opinion. Here&#x27;s my story.<p>I wanted to use the r.pi for storing sensor data sent from an arduino over serial port. The arduino worked rock stable but there were so many problems with the r.pi. Let me describe some of them.<p>First had a problem of r.pi freezing every few days. This was the first revision. The community said I must have had a bad SD card or a bad power supply or a bad USB hub. I was determined to make it work. I went ahead and bought 3 more power supplies and 2 USB hubs and 5 SD cards all of different but recommended models for use with r.pi. The freezes did not go away. At this point the community just started shrugging or saying I must be doing something wrong. This got me very frustrated.<p>So one day I ordered a new r.pi (model A), plugged in place of the old one and freezes were gone, ha!<p>However, there were still problems I could not work out. For example running lcd4linux with dpf-ax display on USB would make the r.pi freeze/crash (with kdb session spawned on r.pi serial port) after a few hours.<p>Another problem was data corruption on power loss. For example I had a FAT formatted USB flash stick to which I was logging data. And one day after an electricity blackout I find 80% of the files on that stick corrupt. I don&#x27;t know why that would happen, I would expect maybe the active files being affected but not the files that had not been read nor written to since months before. Here is an example of data corruption [1]. Can anyone explain how this can happen? Any ideas?<p>I addressed the lcd4linux problem by buying a beaglebone black which has no such problems. I am still scared that one day my data will corrupt again so now I am logging straight to github.<p>To summarize, I think r.pi was definitely not worth the time nor the money I spent on it. Although I really wanted to, I could not make it work in the end.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pingec.si/corruption.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pingec.si/corruption.JPG</a>",1415480190

8578114,comment,8576936,8577981,0,0,jrochkind1,,,"There&#x27;s lots of previous caselaw in the U.S. suggesting API&#x27;s are not copyrightable, basically on the theory that functionality itself, as well as factual statements or descriptions of something, are not copyrightable.<p>For instance, if you write a recipe, the -exact text- of that recipe is copyrightable, but the actual recipe itself is not -- someone else can reword it in their own words, with the same basic ingredients combined using the same operations, and that is not protected by the recipe-writer&#x27;s copyright. This is (or was?) established in U.S. law.<p>Similarly, in the U.S. _functionality_, behaviors or operations themselves, are not copyrightable (although it may be patent-able).  You can copy a competitors functionality exactly, as long as you do it with your own original implementation -- the functionality is not protected by copyright. (This is why people do &#x27;clean room&#x27; compatible implementations by developers who never saw the original code they are copying the functionality of). In general, the right reverse engineer and reproduce the functionality of a technical work without the permission of the copyright holder of the original work -- is (or has been?) legal and protected.<p>(I am not sure the judges involved realized the relationship between promoting the copyrightability of API, and what this does to the previously well-established right to reverse engineer and create compatible things).<p>So the belief, previous to this case, was that an API is more like functionality, or the steps in the recipe. An implementation of an API is copyrightable -- but the description of the API itself, the classes, methods and signatures, are more like functionality or statements of fact, more like the steps of a recipe or a description of behavior. Both of which are not copyrightable -- you can&#x27;t prevent someone from &quot;doing the same thing&quot;, only from copying your particular code or text), then they are like a creative work in fixed medium themselves (the exact text of a particular written recipe, or a particular code implementation. (Patent law lets you prevent others from &#x27;doing the same thing&#x27;, but that&#x27;s a different law with different requirements for what is patentable vs what is copyrightable, different legal rules for determining if a violation occured and what the penalties are, etc.)<p>You are (or were?) allowed to copy an API in your own implementation by reverse engineering in order to create a compatible implementation, and it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense if you lose this right because you can get the API from docs instead of reverse engineering it.<p>I&#x27;d imagine you can get more details from various briefs involved these cases, as far as cites to specific previous law. But to many, the fact that API&#x27;s are not copyrightable is what&#x27;s consistent with existing law over copyright, including the lack of copyright over the actual operations of a recipe themselves and the protected ability to reverse engineer someone elses thing to create your own compatible implementation. It seems to many that making API&#x27;s copyrightable is inconsistent with much existing law.",1415480019

Computers these days are fast enough, and have enough storage space that writing Vim will be mostly straight forwards.<p>The first thing to do, as is for <i>all</i> software, is to make a spec and a roadmap. The doesn&#x27;t have to be anything too serious, hell, you don&#x27;t even have to write it out if you don&#x27;t want to - this is your project after all. (But writing thing down is highly recommended.)<p>Your spec and roadmap, whether just a notion in your head, or a multi-page written out document with pictures and graphs, should talk about every single feature you want, then break those down into milestones and then break <i>those</i> down into smaller and smaller steps, until they&#x27;re small enough that you can just start coding (or start googling for the right library)<p>> What things would I need to teach myself?<p>Well, you say you know Python and C++. Both are valid choices to write HunnypotVim in; it&#x27;s your project, so pick one or the other (or a combination of both if you&#x27;re feeling masochistic). Whatever you chose, you&#x27;ll need to teach yourself various libraries and their API for your chosen language.<p>Next, you&#x27;ll have to decide if you want to make a terminal program, or if you&#x27;d rather write a GVim style GUI editor. If you chose a terminal program, you&#x27;ll need to learn ncurses; a GUI program will need a GUI toolkit, such as QT. Ncurses will have the &#x27;getch&#x27; single-character input reader that you&#x27;ll need in order to reimplement Vim.<p>You&#x27;ll also need to learn how to parse command line arguments and file IO.<p>I&#x27;d probably start with a trivial command line argument parser, then move onto basic fileIO before starting in on the ncurses frontend development. Implement normal mode, then hjkl movement keys, finish up with a basic insert mode, and you&#x27;ve got your basic Vim clone!<p>Additional features left as an exercise for the reader ;)<p>My email&#x27;s in my profile if you&#x27;d like to discuss this further.<p>Good luck, and happy coding!",1415478019

After a tense 12 minutes searching for the pin, the bombardier decided, correctly, that it must be high up in the bomb bay and invisible because of the curvature of the bomb. A short man, he jumped to pull himself up to get a look at where he thought the locking pin should be. Unfortunately, he evidently chose the emergency bomb-release mechanism for his handhold. The weapon dropped from its shackle and rested momentarily on the closed bomb-bay doors with Captain Kulka splayed across it in the manner of Slim Pickens in Dr. Strangelove. Kulka grabbed at a bag that had providentially been stored in the bomb bay, while the more-than-three-ton bomb broke open the bomb-bay doors and fell earthward. The bag Kulka was holding came loose, and he found himself sliding after the bomb without his parachute. He managed to grab something-he wasn&#x27;t sure what-and haul himself to safety. Moments later the plane was rocked by the shock wave of the blast when the bomb hit the ground.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://io9.com/5904633/in-1958-america-accidentally-dropped-a-nuclear-weapon-on-two-little-girls-playhouse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://io9.com/5904633/in-1958-america-accidentally-dropped-...</a><p>NB Of course, only the chemical explosives in the bomb exploded.",1415476831

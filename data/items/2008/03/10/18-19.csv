It requires very fine deal negotiation and value assessment skills.<p>My favorite move in monopoly is to come up with some trading deals that would give everyone monopolies in a single turn, but make it so that I had either a positional (read: my piece is either in jail or far, far away from their monopolies) or money advantage. Then, mortgage/sell all my other properties, build up as much as possible and hope to kill someone quickly. In monopoly, you have to play the 'do or die' strategy. There is no other way to play.<p>Unfortunately, now they no longer do any deals with me because they know my deals are deadly even though they look fair...",1205175175

133326,comment,133055,133101,0,0,jan_g,,,"You have to ask ask yourself, ""why's that so"" ? Why the so called day coders do Java, C# or COBOL and not Smalltalk, LISP or Ruby ? There's a reason for everything and in programming the reason to use language a instead of language b in a software ""factory"" is definitely effectivity. That is, how fast a product can be done using Java/C# or lisp ? How much is  it gonna cost to maintain that product and add features ? How much is it going to cost to train new people ? And so on.<p>Those economists in management surely don't wake up one day and announce : ""We will use C#"".",1205175144

The subject of discussion is whether it makes sense to try to figure out person’s traits or abilities based on his/her gender. He is talking about how hard it is to figure out person’s gender based on the height (or a trait). Totally opposite! The right question should be: can you estimate person’s height based on gender? The result would be much more positive.",1205174211

But saying that makes the fundamental assumption that there will never be a cheap version of the iPhone platform.

133296,comment,133055,133268,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I specifically used C# so as not to convolute things. I couldn't very well compare .NET with Java/Ruby/Python, since that would be like comparing 'car' to 'blue/red/orange'. I put .NET in parens next to it so someone that didn't know the distinction would realize why the heck I was suddenly talking about C#, when the article had .NET in the title.<p>I honestly can't speak to C# 3.0, because the little bit I did with C# was at an old job and we were using 2.0. I guess I would clarify that coming from C++, Java once seemed elegant and fun, but no longer does. C# never seemed elegant or fun to me, because I had already worked in a dozen other languages by the time I got to it, and frankly, it (2.0) seemed like a Java wannabe. (And I'm not exactly a Java fan either.)<p>As for garbage collection... not even sure what in my post made you mention that, but I wouldn't exactly consider a garbage collector to be an earth shattering feature. Many languages have had them for years.<p>I can't claim to be a .NET expert by any means, and, as I pointed out in my last sentence (and you pointed out with your links), the .NET ecosystem seems better than one would expect. I <i>was</i> trying to point out the problems as I saw them in the traditional <i>Microsoft</i> ecosystem (and the modern day Java one)... namely, the accumulation of cruft (Java) and the cost of tools/libraries/software (MS).",1205172634

It does teach a good lesson though, which is index as little as possible by using composite indexes where you can!<p>In databases its amazing how 1 bad table/query/index can hose the performance of the either database - and once you find it, you get such a performance boost!",1205172268

But I don&#x27;t mean to pick on you personally, so I hope you don&#x27;t feel that way.<p>How many people have any real basis for knowing what Zuckerberg meant by those words? A line like that could mean almost anything. You&#x27;d have to have known him at the time. Also, how many people can truly claim never to have said anything just as bad or foolish? Those two groups must be minuscule, yet to be justified in making such an accusation, you&#x27;d have to belong to both of them.<p>Far more likely, what&#x27;s going on here is wishful thinking, where the wish is e.g. to see someone else as a monster. The quote is just a convenient prop.<p>People bring it out at the slightest provocation. It has become an internet reflex, so it no longer adds any information. More importantly, it&#x27;s the opposite of the principle of charity—i.e. giving the other person the benefit of the doubt—which we try to practice here.",1430384108

Linked lists were used extensively in the engine to track units with shared behavior. [...] Some of the link fields were shared among several lists, so it was necessary to know exactly which list an object was linked into in order to safely unlink. And some link fields were even stored in C unions with other data types to keep memory utilization to a minimum. So the game would blow up all the time. All the time.<p>Serialising game state to disk was done by moving all those scattered objects into a contiguous memory block, re-link, save to disk, and then restore the game engine&#x27;s internal state.<p>> It was necessary to fixup all the link pointers (taking special care of unioned pointer fields) so that all 1600 units could be written at once. And then unfixup the link pointers to keep playing.

This is partly fixed by the fact that installing software is such a pita and hard to automate that you don&#x27;t install much 3rd party software on windows.",1430381331

The basic idea behind positioning is that customer education is hard, it&#x27;s much easier to piggyback onto another company&#x27;s success when it comes to telling them what you can do for them.<p>Burger King had it easy. They let McDonalds do all the hard work of figuring out where to put restaurants, and Burger King just put theirs across the street.<p>Taglines, being the most heavily compressed medium possible for a startup to convey themselves, are simply that much more prone to positioning-speak. There is exactly zero room for customer education, all you can do is position.<p>Personally I think the way forward is to de-emphasize taglines, and move towards short blurbs. The startup space is entirely too crowded for USPs to easily conveyed in a single statement. But everyone expects you to be able to anyway.",1430381277

Windows specifically uses DLLs as non-dirty swap, i.e. if the memory manager want&#x27;s to free up pages it may free memory pages used for mapping a least recently used DLL because it will not require it to write any &quot;dirty&quot; memory. A DLL page can never be dirty. Windows knows that it really easy to read in the image again (from the DLL) - so it can just kill the page and reuse it immediately. But then it has to know that it <i>can</i> get the exact same memory page back from the DLL. If the DLL has been deleted or changed that would lead to  some strange errors.",1430381087

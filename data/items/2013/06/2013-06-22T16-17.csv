5924284,comment,5923046,5923046,1,0,amchenault,,,"This post makes some interesting points about the additional complexities the Instagram team will face as they integrate video uploading, editing, and consuming into their users&#x27; activity streams.<p>I think there are some interesting reasons why Instagram needed to do this that are worth noting. Instagram&#x27;s high level of user engagement is in my experience predicated on the way it captures (1) beautiful experiences that are (2) relevant to me (3) without the clutter of posts that are of any other category. Facebook and Twitter are both fantastic and I use them all the time, but Instagram is the first and last app I use every day because it is a purely positive experience to consume.<p>I think there is a certain saturation point where there is a maximum number of social apps that a person can afford to be engaged with at any point. While the idea of Vine was appealing to me, I have resisted it because I just don&#x27;t have room to add another app into my consumption patterns. Same thing goes for Path.<p>So the reason I think Instagram did the right thing in adding video, and in fact had to, is that an app like Vine is really an extension of the same concept that Instagram did with photos. If I want to have that kind of experience, I would prefer to do it all in one place, and so I think there was always going to be a gravitational pull for one app to win in both of those categories.<p>Vine is great, and I have no doubt they will continue to see success in the myriad of other ways people use it that are dissimilar from Instagram. But I think Instagram did the right and necessary thing in taking on this added complexity.",1371920269

Any form of lie-detection or telepathy would reveal they truly believe they are doing the best, most moral thing by getting themselves in a position of power. I find this attitude hard to describe; imagine I am a good person, anything that is good for me is good for everyone, I should be leader, anything that makes me leader is good, anything that restricts my leadership is bad for everyone all merged together into one single thought. Perhaps I am the state is the best summary.<p>This is how you get civil libertarians restricting others civil liberties, homosexuals getting elected on anti-homosexual legislation, and drug-users campaigning for harsh penalties for drug use. These people do not see any contradiction between their words and their actions; it is as if words and actions are the same thing to them. If I campaign for civil rights, then I am a civil rights leader, my actions are irrelevant. They do not seem to understand that other people can be good, that they themselves can be evil; or how restricting their own power could possibly be good. They do not seem to understand that arrests, investigations, or invasions, whether of privacy or of nations, which do not harm themselves could harm other people.",1371920225

5924274,comment,5918724,5921778,2,0,whimsy,,,"> there are a large number of syntactical ambiguities, so writing a parser for it should be completely impossible<p>Keep in mind that while your protest does sound intuitive - e.g. that Ruby can be syntactically ambiguous, ergo it is unparseable, it turns out that that doesn&#x27;t stop us from writing a parser. We can parse most things even if we can&#x27;t parse the &quot;general case.&quot; When we DO encounter something unparseable, the compiler can a) guess or b) fail, hopefully with a message that will help us investigate and rectify the failure.<p>You point out that Perl&#x27;s syntax may be worse than Ruby&#x27;s, and I assume that implies that it is more syntactically ambiguous, ergo, writing a parser should also be impossible for Perl. It turns out that Perl is provably unparseable in the general case - in fact, it&#x27;s been done rather rigorously: <a href=""http://www.jeffreykegler.com/Home/perl-and-undecidability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jeffreykegler.com/Home/perl-and-undecidability</a><p>Regardless of Perl&#x27;s <i>general</i> unparseability, we have compilers for Perl and even large projects manage to compile to what appear to be functional executables. The same is true for Ruby.<p>I wrote this comment mostly a reminder that while something may appear to be insoluble, we may be able to solve for sufficient cases that we don&#x27;t care about the rest, particularly if we have an oracle to fix the number of cases that we can&#x27;t solve. (In this case, the oracle is the developer.)",1371920180

There&#x27;s a more focused explanation which which still hinges on honesty: when there are two candidates, one is running on values, one isn&#x27;t, the former wins.  Obama has been honestly running on (hard Left) values, and beat two opponents who weren&#x27;t.

When a fuel tank explodes, it&#x27;s not because the fuel inside detonates, it&#x27;s because the fuel inside is being vaporized by the heat of the external fire, and that vapor takes up a whole lot more space, resulting in a huge pressure increase, resulting in a BLEVE. If a pressure release valve can vent the pressure before that happens, no explosion...<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_liquid_expanding_vapor_explosion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_liquid_expanding_vapor_...</a><p>That being said...

The team that builds the match engine for the electronic exchange, the team that builds the boot ROM for your smart phone, the team that builds the Google crawler and indexing, the teams building kernel SAN storage code --- these teams are hired by technical interviews.<p>The &quot;audition project&quot; is a trend story with, from what I can see, very little empirical evidence to back it up. When the most notable example of a company routinely employing audition is Treehouse --- all due respect to Treehouse, but still --- that&#x27;s a red flag.<p>The bigger red flag is that the paid audition project method has obvious flaws. The top 20% of software developers are almost uniformly employed. Prospective new employers for these people court them actively; in fact, the problem of companies luring top developers out of other companies is so challenging that large SFBA tech companies have entered into illegal compacts to stifle the practice. Companies are so hard-up for talent that they&#x27;ll &quot;buy&quot; startups just to get access to their teams.<p>In this environment, why would a top developer, who has their choice among tens of different high-paying interesting jobs, <i>moonlight</i> for a prospective new employer just so they can make sure the relationship&#x27;s going to work?<p>Most technical interviews are terribly flawed. They aren&#x27;t standardized and they aren&#x27;t rigorous so you can&#x27;t compare candidates on any apples-apples basis and you can&#x27;t correlate them to job performance to make them more predictive. Most of the developers tasked with conducting them suck at interviewing; many use interviews as a sort of hazing ritual, and most use them as opportunity to project their own subjective views about how software should be built onto candidates. Many technical interviews are trivia games punctuated by awkward attempts at working through code on a whiteboard or a piece of paper in a high-pressure environment.<p>The solution to this problem is to improve technical interviews. It&#x27;s not to pretend that the whole market for devs has suddenly embraced temp- to- perm hiring. It hasn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s getting <i>harder</i> to find good developers, not easier, and the notion that companies have the luxury of inflicting &quot;audition projects&quot; on candidates is counter to reality.",1371919432

Later on and after huge expansion they realize that flat text files really is not the best solution, in fact it is pretty much the worst solution and decide that a rewrite with better technology is needed.<p>At this point you say you lose all respect for them?

The gas likely started the fire, but it&#x27;s extremely unlikely the tank failed catastrophically, so the amount of gas available to the fire was likely pretty minimal (just what was leaking out of a small puncture or something like that). Note how the paint is burned off the top 3/4 of the driver&#x27;s door, as if the fire were coming down from the top.

There are plenty of other ways to end up dead (or dying) in a car collision, that&#x27;s just a moderately common one.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_aortic_rupture#Features"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_aortic_rupture#Featur...</a>",1371917480

This is not correct.<p>First, when you buy a new iPhone, the way you authenticate yourself is by entering your Apple ID and password. Once entered, your new device will begin receiving iMessage data. This means that Apple is capable of provisioning a virtual device with your credentials, which will receive your messages. From there, they can be either stored or forwarded to third parties.<p>Second, your iPhone runs binaries distributed by Apple. There is no technical reason why these binaries could not contain code to forward historical messages to Apple or to a third party. Even if they don&#x27;t now, a future update to iOS (which you won&#x27;t be able to audit) could introduce such code.<p>The only way to have private communication is for all parties to run open-source clients. Each party must have the technical skill to audit the source code, or there must be at least one (preferably multiple) trusted third-party auditor. They must distribute encryption keys through a separate channel which does not depend on the communication host.<p>In other words, the standard Thunderbird+GPG+keyparty system that is popular among nerds but has seen no uptake among the general population.",1371917111

Apollo falls under this since those damn Commies were involved.
  2) The &quot;I don&#x27;t want to die poor&quot; driver. The Columbus voyages fall under this
  3) The praise of royalty and deities (don&#x27;t see much of this except for the 700 Club and Scientology; are they building spaceships?)

The first two are sort of contained in a race against China. If the U.S. &quot;loses&quot;, it will suffer the same fate as Russia; irrelevance.",1371916929

As budgets continue to shrink, countries are under pressure to cut the number of units purchased, which increases the per-unit price (design and development, being fixed costs, have to be spread amongst a smaller number of units.)<p>For new designs coming about after &#x27;91, it&#x27;s even harder as the design work is being done at the same time. With systems like the F-35, LCS, AAAV, NH90, and others, the money is shrinking even as development is taking place, and the spiraling costs of systems that &quot;can do everything&quot; in an environment where no one can assume was the nature of the next generation of threats will be has made procurement something of a disaster.<p>The last element is national. European nations are reluctant, no matter how much money it may save, to completely forgo their national defense industries in favor of larger conglomerates or the U.S. There are many areas of overlap where there is already a better, proven alternative in the market (Airbus A400M could be served by the C-17, NH90 can be handled by the SH60 series, Nimrod MRA4 by the P-8. I note all of the alternatives in favor of U.S. kit, but there are older examples of this happening in the other direction)",1371916872

Then you need to think about how that shapes your opinions so that you can understand the complaints of the less privileged.<p>For example, if you are a white New Yorker, you might say &quot;stop and frisk is fine, I never get stopped so they must only be stopping criminals&quot;. However, once you realise that the police disproportionately stop black people, you are better able to understand black people&#x27;s complaints about the policy.

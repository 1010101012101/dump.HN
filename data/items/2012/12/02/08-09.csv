4860625,comment,4858943,4860511,4,0,elq,,,"my problem with this library (well, actually the internal version, I haven't looked much at the code in github) is that it was written from the perspective of an edge service - the netflix API. The needs of that system are quite different from the needs of middle-tier systems.<p>The API has a hell of a lot more surface area but is trivial in complexity compared other systems at netflix, and therefor this library has some huge gaps in design.<p>The two biggest issues IMHO are putting the throttling/fallback handling at the outermost edge of an external service rather than at the lowest level (i.e. the actual rpc) and a very C/errno like method of handling errors.<p>I'm also quite unhappy with the API. It require creating boilerplate classes to implement the commands. Yuck. A bit of magic with annotations or code gen would've been much cleaner and much less prone to errors caused by programmer fatigue or boredom.",1354438696

You're dividing attention between the controls and the radio, but 1) you have another person to help you, and 2) the people you're talking to on the radio are there <i>specifically</i> to make sure you don't hit anyone.

4860619,comment,4859132,4860451,2,0,georgeorwell,,,"> That's not because Africa has gotten poorer.<p>Do you have any references for that claim?<p>My understanding is that whereas (sub-Saharan) African people by and large used to be farmers and were generally able to grow enough food, drink enough water, build adequate shelter, and make enough clothes, that since colonization (which got going in earnest in 1880) the continent was basically shoehorned into modern industrial society and that now many Africans are dependent on whatever foreign aid they can get and are no longer self-sufficient.<p>What I'm saying is that if you went to Africa in 1800 I don't believe you would see today's stereotypical child in rags with ribs sticking out of his chest and a swollen belly, but again, if you have a reference that says colonization (or its later rejection) did nothing to change poverty in Africa it would be interesting to read it.",1354438630

For web developers, I feel like the Air is almost the default option. That your budget is so high (under $1700 would seem to include the vast majority of laptops) suggests you may be doing something that needs serious CPU/GPU performance, in which case our goals are different.<p>For me, portability was paramount (otherwise why get a laptop?), so I wanted it lightweight and no bigger than 13"". Second, I wanted it to have an SSD so it'd be fast. I had read that replacing hard drives with SSDs makes a huge difference in responsiveness and that turns out to be absolutely true. All other specs (CPU, RAM, ...), I didn't care about because I felt confident they would be good enough.<p>Those goals narrowed it down to either one of the PC ultrabooks (which System76 does not make, unfortunately) or the Air. Out of the PC ultrabooks, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon was the best contender, and w1ntermute's comments in this thread: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4849781"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4849781</a> have convinced me that if I were buying a laptop today, I'd probably pick the X1 Carbon over the Air.

I got very angry when I tried to solve them, since I pretty much didn't knew how to program, just about the basics of pythons syntax. What made me even more angry was, when I tried to find the solution many people suggested using all different modules and learning how to use it, instead of telling how to solve it with what I thought was programming.

Rather, the core issue is that most of the things you have to keep in mind to write fast Haskell (like dealing with laziness) are very different from what you would have to keep in mind with more common languages that you are already familiar with.<p>That said, as I noted, the performance is usually good enough even with naively written code; you would only have to spend time optimizing a few select parts of most programs.<p>Another little problem is that there are not many resources on how to optimize Haskell code. This is a little annoying if you're learning on your own; however, I think it's offset by the Haskell community. I've seen some of the best Haskell programmers give <i>very</i> detailed responses on StackOverflow and the mailing list, so there is always somebody to help you while you're learning.<p>There are also some advantages to OCaml--it's a very fast language itself and it behaves in a way that's easier to predict especially since you can leverage more of your existing experience. OCaml is also a very nice languages; while I prefer Haskell, I would be perfectly happy with OCaml (and, in fact, I've only used OCaml and not Haskell in production).<p>I should add a big caveat to this whole post: while I've used both Haskell and OCaml a fair bit, I've avoided doing anything super performance sensitive. I usually care more about having correct, readable code quickly than I do about how fast it runs. So I am definitely no expert on optimizing either Haskell or OCaml!",1354436416

4860536,comment,4859086,4859086,2,0,corporalagumbo,,,"Okay. Here is how I look at it. I am a smart, focussed, imaginative guy. I believe pretty strongly that if I lived in a city where I was in close proximity to a lot of other smart, talented people, I could make some great things happen. I have a lot of ideas that would require teams of such people to realise, any one of which could become an important business or non-profit venture. The Internet is great, and web-based collaboration and idea-realisation tools are certainly developing and making the world flatter, but proximity is still a very large catalyst to things happening. San Francisco happens to sound like one of the best cities for someone like me to move to. I happen to live very far from San Francisco, in another country. I am sure there are a lot of people like me around the world. The cost and difficulty and unknowns of the idea of moving to SF are pretty intimidating.<p>Now what would happen if all the people like me were able to easily move to San Francisco, and start meeting and talking and coming up with ideas and doing things together? If those big walls of distance, national borders, and evidently prohibitively expensive real estate were broken down? I imagine some very great things could happen. One thing this article pin-pointed is interesting: salaries at major SF tech companies are high because of the housing shortage. What might happen if you could concentrate the world's smartest people in one great city with affordable housing, so that the companies they might start could pay lower wages? Well you could definitely start companies a lot easier, and they could be profitable at lower levels, so it would encourage I think better and more diverse companies and internet services. I think San Francisco would also benefit hugely.<p>I think eventually a city like this has to come along eventually. If there is going to be a global village, there needs to be a global hub where the best and the brightest can meet and work together. Currently the world doesn't have such a place. It seems like SF has as good a shot as any of becoming that hub. Doing so would of course require some sacrifices, so the question for SF seems to be, do you want to go on being sorta great but holding off true greatness because you don't want to give up any of the things you like about the way you have things now, or are you willing to aim high?<p>The question for anyone else is, what can you do to make it much much easier for people from around the world to gather together in a single place? There are a lot of legislatory hurdles to be dissolved. Also anyone who made it their business to help people make the jump could do well I think.<p>Also, as an aside, nation-states and borders are so 20th century. Eventually the world will have no borders - a truly united world has to happen eventually. Removing borders should be a priority for everybody.",1354436054

If portability is not a big deal, I prefer C# and DirectX (via sharpDX). It's much less code than C++, and just not as insane.<p>> And since # of bugs is proportional to the number of lines of code, I end up way ahead.<p>Can't tell if you are being serious here. That's just not true at all; it's well known that LOC is a poor indicator of bug occurrence.",1354435599

I only bring this up because I remember when the term ""the digg effect"" was used for the first time. I also remember people testing services like MediaTemple to see if it could stand up against the incoming traffic. There was so much focus on having beefy hardware when really all everyone needed was better caching.",1354435494
4860517,comment,4859973,4859973,1,0,uonyechi,,,"When you said simpler, I hoped you'd be advocating less abstraction. Anyway, opinions on C++ largely depend on what kind of software you're developing. If you're not writing high-performance apps, there are more productive than languanges than C++. Otherwise, less abstraction is absolutely neccessary especially for memory management. So C++11 has no choice but to remain as feature rich as it is. You should have to pick what features to work it.",1354435292

Then you have the SF summer/winds. Lastly, you have an existing stock of Victorian (actually, edwardian in most places) architecture that is worth keeping, for cultural reasons (/arguably).",1354435228

Product development isn&#x27;t, though - Linus had to release an operating system on his own before he could recruit volunteers to help with it.  And many of the outside contributions come from corporations who would like to use/support Linux but need to modify or extend it in some way, and so they contribute the patch themselves.<p>There are big companies that work the same way.  Cisco actively encourages employees to work from home.  However, Cisco&#x27;s product-development strategy is &quot;buy startups that are already succeeding in the market&quot;, and so if you work at Cisco your job is generally bug-fixing and incremental improvements to existing products.

But it scales very well for the all of the sites I&#x27;ve tried, and I think based on the architecture it would scale to much larger sites.<p>Your workflow with Rack->Ramaze should work similarly when using Roda.

Cells from the invading placenta digest their way through the endometrial surface, puncturing the mother’s arteries, swarming inside and remodelling them to suit the foetus. Outside of pregnancy, these arteries are tiny, twisty things spiralling through depths of the uterine wall. The invading placental cells paralyse the vessels so they cannot contract, then pump them full of growth hormones, widening them tenfold to capture more maternal blood. These foetal cells are so invasive that colonies of them often persist in the mother for the rest of her life, having migrated to her liver, brain and other organs. There’s something they rarely tell you about motherhood: it turns women into genetic chimeras.<p>The whole article sounds so creepy.

Package managers are supposed to resolve conflicts between those automatically,<p>- new feature, but backward binary compatible; just some new code alongside the old. Package managers should also be able to resolve a conflict between dependencies that depend on different versions of those.<p>- bug fix: forward and backward <i>source</i> compatible; here we have a problem: we can guarantee developers that they won&#x27;t have to edit a single line of code to migrate, but we can&#x27;t allow (binary) package managers to do anything. They have to rebuild their library, which means bumping their own version number. And does that means that their new version becomes binary-incompatible with the previous one, or just their dependencies?... who knows? Maybe it depends on if the consumer of that library calls into the conflicting dependency directly or only uses it indirectly? Maybe not? Can we tell?<p>- new feature, backward <i>source</i> compatibility, but no binary compatibility; same as above: package managers cannot do anything, and conflicting transitive dependencies on the new and the old may or may not be solved by recompiling one&#x27;s library. The only safe bet is to wait for the dependencies to upgrade.<p>- all bets are off (possibly split in <i>minor</i> and <i>major</i>): here at least we know there is nothing to be hoped. But in practice after upgrading to the new API, you are faced with the same questions concerning that thing&#x27;s dependencies...<p>And if every dependency manager within the same packaging eco-system doesn&#x27;t enforce a single global versioning scheme, how can they handle any dependency version conflict anyway? They could if packages could auto-describe their semantic versioning, so basically they can&#x27;t, so they don&#x27;t, and we&#x27;re back to source dependencies, with recompile and bump in version number for every dependency change (ok, sometimes they do try and we get JAR hell...).\nAnd since a single versioning scheme isn&#x27;t enforced, people use hundreds of different ones (or just none), and the maintainer of a library has to make all of those decisions, recursively (except that below 1 level of dependency, he/she might not be able to do anything as long as even a single dependency keeps an old conflicting dependency around, but they still have to check, in case they are lucky and can do something), taking into account the different versioning semantics of each dependency. That&#x27;s madness.<p>So in the end, if we get a conflict between dependencies far down in the dependency tree, it becomes something pretty ugly:<p>- if guaranteed binary compatibility, everything is fine,<p>- otherwise:<p>0) look at that dependency&#x27;s official versioning scheme, usually find nothing (except for big famous libraries)<p>1) pick the highest common-one, try to recompile your library<p>2) if it works, try the tests (your library&#x27;s tests, not your dependencies&#x27; tests, mind you. Even though those should probably be run, considering they directly depend on it, and use (and hopefully test) more stuff from that library)<p>3a) it it works, ship it and pray.<p>3b) it will probably fail somewhere since the dependencies in between have not be recompiled; then you can only wait for them to upgrade.<p>I know in the end this doesn&#x27;t work so bad (well, everything is relative...), but it still makes me sad that upgrading dependencies is still human-based trial and error.<p>Oh. I guess this is a rant.<p>[1] that&#x27;s just what I am the most familiar with, but you could say the same with C packages in a distro&#x27;s package repo, for example.",1407538186

However, I think people would actually compete to get into SpaceX, thus the actual terms of the contract wouldn&#x27;t include that. In short, let the market decide voluntarily, what are the best terms.<p>What&#x27;s going on now is one side (employees) taking advantage of the other side. I don&#x27;t care how rich Elon Musk is.

They&#x27;re great, and so is Picnic. They understand HIPAA. I&#x27;ll let @nogaleviner speak to the specifics of their HIPAA considerations but I do want to clear up some general things up about HIPAA since we&#x27;ve (as has Picnic) been working on this for a year or two now.<p>1. It&#x27;s HIPAA, not HIPPA.\n2. The &quot;P&quot; in HIPAA stands for Portability (h/t @katgleason). The salient parts of HIPAA for this conversation are:\n  a. HIPAA makes what Picnic does <i>possible</i>. The overall point of HIPAA is to open up data, to let patients say to their doctor &quot;I want my medical record&quot; and require doctors to fulfill that request. The September 2013 update to HIPAA even said that if a patient asks for their records electronically, their doctor has to provide them electronically. Without HIPAA, Picnic probably wouldn&#x27;t exist.\n  b. HIPAA does stipulate two Rules: the Security Rule and the Privacy Rule. In a nutshell, these rules don&#x27;t prescribe specific implementations but do require general considerations. The high-level overview is: data has to be encrypted in transit and at rest, all data access has to be logged (for auditing), and employees have to be HIPAA-trained. Generally speaking if you build something that meets a decently high level of conventional web security standards, you could probably meet the technical requirements for HIPAA.<p>Now this is important: while b) is true, this actually only applies to entities who are required to be HIPAA-compliant, i.e., medical care providers. Technically Picnic isn&#x27;t a care provider and therefore does not need to be HIPAA-compliant.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean Picnic doesn&#x27;t take security and privacy very seriously. And I can tell you they do: their site is SSL-enabled and they know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>Again, just speaking to the HIPAA points here, not the business considerations.

Some of them do move towards doing their own R&D but they have to deal with the same success:failure ratios as existing pharma companies.<p>I feel like you think bi pharma just wants huge margins out of greed and that the failures or research that goes nowhere is somehow costless.

Hackers produce new conceptions, perceptions and sensations hacked out of raw data. Everything and anything is a code for the hacker to hack, be it “programming, language, poetic language, math, or music, curves or colourings” [3] and once hacked, they create the possibility for new things to enter the world. What they create is not necessarily “great”, or “even good”, but new, in the areas of culture, art, science, and philosophy or “in any production of knowledge where data can be extracted from it.”\nWark argues that (new) information comes from the hack. It doesn’t matter if you are a computer programmer, a philosopher, a teacher, a musician, a physicist, if you essentially produce new information - it’s a hack [1]. In this sense, hackers are creators and they bring new ideas into the world. The aim of the book is to highlight the origins, purpose and efforts by this emerging hacker class, who produce new; concepts, perceptions, and sensations out of the stuff of raw data.&#x27;",1407535599

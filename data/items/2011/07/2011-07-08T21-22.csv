They think lifestyle design is a guaranteed path out of their crappy lives in cubicle prisons and the burden of the middle-class life script, mortgage and all. A question I recently answered on Quora very clearly reveals the mental model many people have: Is it hard to build, market and maintain a web app that makes at least $1000 a month?
...<p>You can tell an engineer asked this question even without reading further, because the question asks about how hard the work is. The gambler/marketer version of such questions is always how lucky do you have to be? The engineer asks about effort. The gambler/marketer asks about odds, and picks the game with the most favorable odds that he can find. 2/3 is better than 1/2. If Id asked the question, Id have phrased it as: how many apps do you have to publish in order to be fairly sure of having at least one hit that makes $1000 or more a month?""<p><a href=""http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/06/02/the-las-vegas-rules-i-the-slightly-malevolent-universe/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/06/02/the-las-vegas-rules-i-t...</a><p>In other words, perseverance and risk management are essential skills - ones that few people seek serious training and practice in, rather than lip service.<p>A bad job will kill you, but poor risk management will do it faster.

2744242,comment,2743894,2744147,3,0,glassx,,,"A personal example.<p>Just when I started college, was trying to write a 3D game in C++ (I was young, so yeah, I thought it was just C with classes, LOL).<p>Since I had no idea about design patterns, so I made a singleton called ""Rendering Manager"" that took care of ""everything-OpenGL"". I would have numerous classes, like CHuman, CHero, CParticle, CBuilding (it was more abstract but whatver) and stuff like that that inherited from something like a CDrawable, which had a CDrawable::Render() method.<p>The problem was that the CDrawable::Render() would call the singleton by itself, so it had a direct dependency with the Rendering Manager. If I had to change something on the singleton, I'd have to change a lot of other classes.<p>When I needed to render on different ""virtual screens"", for reflections, shadows, cameras (yes, it was funky lol), I had to put global state on the singleton in order to make it render things in different ways.<p>When I needed LOD (level of detail), I had to pass the camera position via a global, only adding more globals to the mess.<p>Of course, I was just a student back then, but failing spectacularly taught me a lot of new things.<p>--<p>What I would have done today: CDrawable objects would only worry about their own geometry and transformations and would be ignorant about the glorified-OpenGL-wrapper.<p>Instead, we could have a ""Scene Manager"" (which doesn't even have to be a singleton anymore) that ""visits"" each object to ""ask"" them just enough to get them rendered.",1310161711

However, this doesn't necessarily that you need a more complex/sophisticated 'design'. ie. if you stick to TDD this situation is highly unlikely.<p>Hopefully this will stem the tide of questions on Stack Overflow about different Objective-c singleton implementations.",1310161591

2744237,comment,2742533,2743474,4,0,lucasjung,,,"That's really interesting. To put it another way, economic opportunity costs apply to armed conflict.<p>You can even extend this beyond purely defensive wars.<p>The most obvious extension is pre-emptive wars.  A great example would be the Six Days war (aka the 1967 Arab-Israeli war). Israel knew that they were about to be attacked (the massed units on their borders were not subtle), and instead attacked preemptively. Arguably, this reduced the cost of the war for them in a number of ways.  First, by seizing the initiative and the element of surprise, they likely reduced their combat losses relative to what they would have experienced if they had waited for their neighbors to attack.  Even more importantly, the entire war was fought outside of their then-borders, so their infrastructure was not damaged by the fighting.<p>Clausewitz even makes a case for starting a war that <i>you know you are going to lose</i>. That sounds crazy at first, but in some scenarios it makes sense, because it's not just about the balance of power, it's about the direction in which that balance is shifting.  If you are highly certain that another country is going to attack you, and that you will lose, you have to consider whether your defeat would be more or less severe in six months or a year. If the balance of power is shifting in your favor, you want to postpone hostilities as long as possible. If, on the other hand, the balance of power is shifting in favor of your enemy, you want to precipitate a war as soon as possible in the hopes of securing a better position to sue for peace. Either way you know you're going to lose, it's a question of how badly you are going to lose.<p>Finally, even a war of naked aggression could have a nearly immediate net positive impact on your economy if your forces are so superior that you will suffer minimal losses, and if you capture valuable resources as a result, or if you secure tactically valuable terrain that reduces your losses in an impending conflict.  The German annexation of the Sudetenland is a prime example of this.",1310161473

Here are a few of the key messages from marketers we hear over and over again:<p>Were authentic and we know who our influencers are.  What else can we do?<p>Were engaged, but somethings not working.  We cant figure out an ROI.<p>And this one:<p>We cant afford to do any more of these Groupon-type deals.  Its too expensive and we dont even own the data  they do!<p>Finally:<p>We want to keep investing in Twitter, but we cant figure out how to MONETIZE all this engagement.<p>Social marketing has arrived, but theres still a struggle about how to best use the available platforms like Twitter, FourSquare and Facebook (although Facebook is making it a lot easier with their ad platform).  Social marketing has been elevated. Brands understand their networks, and by using tools like Radian6 or Crimson Hexagon, they can read the tea leaves, figure out sentiment, know their influencers and pick out the key words that drive their brand.  But even though social marketing is just getting started, the revenue question still matters, especially to our friends in the finance department, and our money-is-friendly, CFO.<p>Marketers need to know how theyre going to make money in social, and while Twitter is still working on how to solve this conundrum, the question set us to thinking:  is there a way to help marketing teams leverage their investments in social? And more importantly, is there a way to help these same marketers use their existing investment in Twitter to create a more engaged and active following that supports their brand and leads to more revenue.  The simple answer was ""Yes!"" there is a way.<p>In starting Chirp Social, we understood that whatever product we built, it needed to be easy to use and deliver immediate value to our customers who are trying to create social campaigns and drive revenue. We respect the value and benefit that social monitoring and moderation tools provide their users, and we love the clarity that Klout provides around figuring out who really are your key influencers, but we wanted to create a platform that a marketer could use everyday to build simple, meaningful social campaigns and make more money.<p>So we built Chirp Social, a simple Twitter check-in platform that helps companies (small and medium businesses) build promotional offers that can be delivered in real time to their Followers, building loyalty and increasing sales.  We wanted to enable pull marketing rather than the traditional push, and simplify the message.  Keep it simple and the customers will come.<p>The result?  So far, our customers have been blown away by how easy it is to get started and the benefits are immediate and real.  Chirp Social is the first real-time check-in and promotions platform that helps marketers add new followers and engage with their followers on Twitter by delivering meaningful loyalty promotions.<p>What can Chirp Social do to help me get more out of my social marketing dollars?<p>Increase your followers.<p>Chirp Social helps a company get more followers by providing a simple platform to create compelling promotions for customers who follow your company on Twitter or check-in to get your promotions via Twitter.<p>More Customer Interaction<p>You have a whole new set of customers who arent reading your local newspaper and may not have seen your latest Groupon.  How do you take advantage of your customers and activate them while they are on site and looking to buy?   The Chirp Social platform encourages your customers to check-in on Twitter, become a follower and find out what promotions you may have that day to help them make their purchasing decision.<p>Timely Promotions.<p>Using Chirp Social for delivering promotional offers to your followers is like magic, except it's real.  Your customers see the Chirp Social window cling and find out that there are deals to be had. Customers then ask you for the latest deal with a simple check-in on Twitter and you provide them one; rewarding your loyal followers with a timely offer.<p>Word of Mouth.<p>With the real-time Chirp Social dashboard you can see how well your promotions are doing and run experiments, finding out what promotions convert better.  You can accelerate the benefits of word of mouth marketing by creating a loyal audience, providing them offers that reward them for being engaged with your brand and keep them coming back.<p>We created Chirp Social so every company could get more from their social media investments, create meaningful promotions and engage automatically with their customers and prospects.  Our check-in platform for Twitter helps companies big and small create social campaigns and enable sharing to build greater engagement & conversion.  In the end, its about more dollars, and thats what were trying to do, help marketers get more out of their existing investments in social and create long-term relationships that build over time.",1310161270

But  there is some fundamental lack of understanding regarding relativity that has lead to such a question. In fact, the top answer is incorrect on several levels.<p>1. Technically the only way a person can travel 27 light years in 27 years is by travelling through out at the speed of light. Ignoring the infinite amount of energy required for such travel, there is another aspect of such travel that is not being considered. Time Dilation. So assuming you were born and take off at the speed of light. Yes you will be able to observe your birth on earth 27 years later, but you would still be a baby and not 27 years old. Time would have been effectively frozen for you as you traveled.<p>2. The top answer says that you are always viewing and hearing the past. You are hearing the past, but you are actually viewing the present. The light radiating out of an event you are observing are also causality horizons. In your reference frame you are observing past events depending on the distance. However thanks to relativity and Lorentz contraction, there are reference frames where the distance between you and the event can be arbitrarily close to zero, effectively making the events simultaneous i.e. when you see an event you are effectively watching it as it happens simultaneously, you are not watching the past. This is also an alternative explanation for 1. i.e. the baby cannot grow older if you put it 27 light years away in 27 years time. It will be able to watch its birth, because its only just been born.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_diagram"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_diagram</a>",1310160721

While I completely agree that a file service backup and encryption are a good idea, I think it's important for developers to be able to recover quickly even without these things.<p>1.  Yes, use backup, but also use version control.  Keep your commits sufficiently up to date that you will able to get back to work quickly with a fresh new computer.  Consider it a bad sign if you have to get your new computer restored to exactly the same state as your old computer to resume developing.<p>2. Encrypt, but just don't keep highly sensitive files on a laptop.  I read that 1 in 10 laptop are stolen, and keep in mind that many aren't stolen because they never leave someone's apartment.  If you travel around with your laptop, you're in a higher risk group.  Use dummy data and dummy databases.  Don't store external passwords to real systems on your laptop.  Consider it a bad sign if you can't develop to a local database populated with inconsequential data.<p>3. Definitely buy the insurance policy, if you'd have trouble coming up with the money for a replacement.  But they key here is to make sure that it's just money we're talking about.

I'm not stressed or frustrated or lack the motivation/excitement to work on my startup. I have a steady job and a very healthy schedule (working out, eating healthy, don't drink or smoke), and a bit of money saved up. We're actually very efficient already in terms of programming and making our startups launch.<p>What I'm trying to do is pause the chores/responsbilities/friends/lifestyle I have now, to increase the time I have to work on the startup because it's that appealing to me. I already sleep 6 hours and work 15 hours, so it's really not a big difference for me. It's the environment away from what I currently have that will enable me to spend more time on the startup. I'm 23, which is why I can do something like this before I have to uphold even more responsbilities. Also, a day has 24 hours, so not including sleep and the 15+ hours of work(breaks are included in that 15+ hours), I have 2-3 hours to myself.<p>I'm not feeling insecure or hitting a midlife crises- I'm trying to gain even more productivity time for my startup, and the only way I see around it is to temporarily take a break from stuff I'm attached to here.<p>ALSO: 
The only calls I plan are taking are from Hong Kong itself in case an emergency happens (A recent relative had a stroke and is in a Hong Kong hospital).
Going to Hong Kong enables me to take trips to China, which is a lot of fun and doesn't require staying longer than a day to enjoy.
I'm also choosing Hong Kong because I can borrow the vacant house for free (courtesy of my parents). Going to Canada is around 1k round trip for me, whereas Hong Kong is 1.1k round trip. I'd rather go to Hong Kong in terms of that preference. The remaining $900 involves around $200-300 for china (paying the visa to visit there, transportation, etc) and the rest is for food.
I've considered going somewhere closer for a week, but I'll definitely burn out if I don't even have anything like China to look forward to. 2 weeks of coding non stop is fine but not 3 weeks( I've done 2 and barely managed to keep motivated towards the end).<p>I could also take an extra week in Hong Kong to do nothing but have fun if that settles any argument for people.<p>----------------------------------------------<p>THE PLAN<p>We go to Hong Kong for 3 weeks, living in a vacant house with 2 rooms (one for sleeping, and one as a makeshift office) doing nothing but coding. Literally sleep 5 hours from 3AM to 8AM, at work for at least 15+ hours a day for 6 days a week. 
Im thinking this could work, because<p>1) no girlfriend, and no friends at all to visit- were only thousands of miles away from them,<p>2) no responsibilities- food will be delivered, trash/laundry taken care of by a maid (my parents offered to have their maid come up to our building and clean once or twice a week),<p>3) theres absolutely nothing to do where we live! Were surrounded by mountains, seniors, and the sea. The only thing we can do is run/workout which we plan on doing the remaining time that were not hacking away on our laptops,<p>4) the one day off we have off- we can use it to travel to China and explore and have fun there. In San Diego, theres really nothing for us to do on our day off anyways- we usually just end up eating lunch, surfing the net, or just hanging out with friends at coffee shops. I figured that the thought of actually going somewhere fun and different like China would be very motivational to keep us working hard the remaining 6 days a week.<p>5) Oh, and forgot to mention- my cofounder is Korean, he doesnt speak a word of Cantonese, which helps with keeping us stay focused.<p>Cons:<p>1)	Id say well each be short 2k in expenses by going to travel to Asia and do nothing but code.<p>2)	For that 2k each, we wont even be doing much sightseeing- so basically a waste of a trip in terms of travelling.

The two diagnostic approaches currently used most often, however, do not allow a satisfactory diagnosis of malaria. Clinical diagnosis, the most widely used approach, is unreliable because the symptoms of malaria are very non-specic. Microscopic diagnosis, the established method for laboratory conrmation of malaria, presents technical and personnel requirements that often cannot be met, particularly in facilities at the periphery of the health care system. In addition, delays in the provision of the microscopy results to the clinician mean that decisions on treatment may be taken without the benet of the results. Thus, the recent introduction of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria is of considerable interest.""",1310159237

So at <i>any</i> point in your code you can call Singleton.getInstance() to have access to the same Singleton object. So it's effectively the same thing as a global variable.<p><i>Edit: Added `static' to be more correct.</i>",1310159098

I don't particularly have sympathy for people that feel that should profit for the rest of their lives off of their music. Either: 1) manage your money wisely when you're making buckets of it (instead of ending up broke when the gravy train stops) or 2) get a job when you stop making music.<p>I seriously doubt that anyone but big name artists are making any significant amount of money from royalties on catalog albums.",1310158900

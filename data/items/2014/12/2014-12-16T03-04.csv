Toxoplasmosis is thought to dramatically affect an individual&#x27;s appetite for risky behavior. Preliminary research suggests that as you&#x27;d expect there &#x27;s a higher seroprevalance in prison populations, but much more work needs to be done to verify this.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis</a>",1418702320

8755798,comment,8750723,8752477,0,0,kamaal,,,"I&#x27;m not talking about Perl 5 per se. But I&#x27;ve worked with C, Java, Pig, Python, Perl and a bit of shell scripting so far. And I&#x27;ve never had a situation where I could simply glance over something and know all of it(This is for reasonably big applications). I&#x27;m currently working on a big Java application where logic is often deep buried below Factor classes, Interfaces, Enums and layers of classes simply passing control to level below. And when you find the code that does something finally, you will see it wrapped will kinds of exception handling code. Its simply too verbose, with pointless ceremonial code.<p>In pig, any reasonably large workflow has had me hooked for hours working with stub data trying to figure out how data flows and comes out.<p>In fact I see this nothing new to Perl. If you are working with any serious application. A good touch over the language plus experience with handling things with patience is a must. Python is no exception to this rule, neither is any language I know of.<p>>>I may be completely missing the mark and actually readability is much better. I really hope so.<p>It depends on how you define readability. I would say verbose code is equally unreadable especially if you work with large applications. If you simply don&#x27;t like regular expression you have a different problem. In some cases use of regular expression is simply unavoidable. IMO Python works very well for applications that interact with standard data sources(Databases, API&#x27;s, XML&#x27;s). Once you get the data to some very easily ingestable form, and there is little work to do from there on, Python works just fine. But Perl works fine for other use cases, heavy lifting and other kinds of data work. Perl may not be the right language for all use cases, but neither is Python or Java.<p>>>Vapourware is vapourware. Perl 6 was meant to be production ready a decade ago.<p>No, I don&#x27;t think they ever gave out a date when they wanted a finished version out. Besides Rakudo is feature ready already. They are just working out last bit of performance issues and good to have things. And plan to have it out by 2015: <a href=""https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/get_ready_to_party/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/get_ready_to_party/</a><p><a href=""http://perl6.org/compilers/features"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perl6.org/compilers/features</a><p>>>On the other hand, I&#x27;m interested in knowing what you think Perl 6 brings that will give it the edge over Python?<p>Grammars, Macros, Concurrency, Traits, Types, Improved regexes, Better OO, Functional programming, User defined operators, Mutable grammar, Junctions, Currying, Continuations, Multiple VM backends to name a few.<p>The full list is at : <a href=""http://perlcabal.org/syn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perlcabal.org/syn/</a><p>>>Do you see it displacing Python as rapidly as Python replaced Perl 5 as the science &quot;glue&quot; language of choice?<p>Perl and Python both co exist and will continue to, albeit the web frameworks market is dominated by Python and Ruby at this point in time, Perl is still pretty big in a lot of places. This isn&#x27;t Perl or Python, people use tools which work for them within their project limitations.<p>But I guess people will use what they find useful. And that only individual projects can decide as to what works best for them.<p>>>With the apparent rise of Julia as well, could it just be too late?<p>Reading the Perl 6 spec will tell how different Perl 6 is with regards to everything else. Even with the delay Perl 6 has suffered, I don&#x27;t see any other tool that has the feature set Perl 6 has to offer.",1418702170

She ended up in second stage (pushing) for 6 hours due to an awkward presentation and was rushed to hospital in an ambulance. She suffered a pretty bad tear and was seriously traumatised by the whole experience - she still has flashbacks almost a year later.<p>3 months later she suffered a prolapse as a result of the labour. Prolapse is the huge dirty secret of vaginal delivery - one woman in two will suffer some degree of prolapse as a result of childbirth, but probably only one in 5 of those will have it badly enough to have symptoms. But once you have it there&#x27;s basically no cure and it can be hugely debilitating. My wife has always been very active, when she was younger she was going to try out for the Spanish national handball team, she has always run a lot, and so on. She will never run again, she shouldn&#x27;t lift any weight at all (not even our daughter), she is basically an invalid by her previous standards. Her sex life has been severely compromised due to nerves in the vaginal wall being crushed - that will never improve either. All this was probably not 100% avoidable but we could have massively improved her odds if we had had access to accurate information ante-natally.<p>Natural childbirth is the biggest lie we have ever suffered from.

Or to a third party who licenses both technologies.<p>In which of those cases is permission from Lab A not supposed to be required in order to make the product?<p>There are two scenarios here. In the first case Lab A doesn&#x27;t license the base patent because it wants to make the product itself or (equivalently) sells or exclusively licenses it to a single manufacturer. In that case Lab B is dealing with a monopsony buyer and is hosed. The holder of the base patent can offer Lab B some fraction of their research cost for their patent, secure in the knowledge that Lab B&#x27;s only alternative is to eat the entire cost and get nothing.<p>In the second case Lab A is licensing the patent to lots of people and you&#x27;re proposing that Lab B license the improvement to the same people. The trouble is Lab A still has all the leverage. The availability of the improvement increases the value of the base patent, which allows Lab A to squeeze the licensees harder and leave less for Lab B. Lab B can&#x27;t respond in kind because the licensees can do business with the Lab A patent without the Lab B patent but not vice versa.",1418700110

8755729,comment,8753088,8755658,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Fair criticism, so let me make a few points on that.<p>Startups can&#x27;t afford full, unconstrained open allocation. They have to give people a high degree of trust and autonomy, but they&#x27;ve also got to be able to meld as a team and hit a target quickly. It&#x27;s when you&#x27;re past 20-40 people that the open vs. closed allocation really becomes critical. (VC is causing companies to grow rapidly beyond that 20-40 mark without developing a coherent culture, and if that phase happens poorly or wrongly, you&#x27;re more likely to get a crappy closed-allocation company.) At 8 people when you&#x27;re fighting for your life, you just need people to do the work that needs to get done.<p>These beasts fueled by VC aren&#x27;t really &quot;startups&quot; in the classical sense. They don&#x27;t offer meaningful, life-changing equity and, while clueless people go all-in, the smarter ones just treat employee positions at them as stepping stones. They&#x27;re closed-allocation companies that are good at dressing themselves as startups. The true power relationships are intense and harsh, but not stated upfront.<p>Open-allocation companies are subject, of course, to many of the same political problems as closed-allocation firms. I think that they&#x27;re <i>less likely</i> to fall into certain failure modes, and I think the evidence is strong that, while open allocation isn&#x27;t a panacea, closed allocation is strictly worse. Let&#x27;s say that you&#x27;re running a school and one fistfight breaks out per week. That&#x27;s not a good thing, and you&#x27;ll have kids out for hospitalizations. But if you arm a randomly selected 10% of the population with handguns, now you&#x27;re at risk people getting killed. <i>Adding</i> the guns to a fight-prone environment was a mistake. Similarly, closed allocation adds something that can only be harmful; but the absence of it doesn&#x27;t guarantee a lack of harm.<p>In banks, the power relationships are more legible; however, there&#x27;s more of a need for management to lead, perhaps in part because there isn&#x27;t an army of clueless 22-year-olds (well, except in &quot;analyst&quot; programs; but even those are more selective than employee-level positions in the Valley.) Managers in finance are more likely to treat their positions as mutual and symbiotic than the &quot;I know all of Sand Hill Road and you don&#x27;t&quot; founders who now run the Valley.",1418700013

8755710,comment,8753526,8754516,0,0,philwelch,,,"> This is why it is imperative to build your model up from first principles.<p>The main problem with this approach (I&#x27;ll call it the Cartesian approach because it was most famously used by Descartes) is that human beings are less than 100% reliable at logical reasoning. If you make an error anywhere in your chain of reasoning, your conclusions are going to be off and there&#x27;s not going to be any way to check them. It&#x27;s just like writing 10,000 lines of code without ever actually compiling it, let alone testing it. You also develop a sort of foolish confidence about the correctness of your own beliefs, which makes it even easier to be wrong. If you make enough wrong turns, you become Ayn Rand.<p>That&#x27;s why empiricism is so good. It&#x27;s not that empiricists don&#x27;t make mistakes too, but when they do, they find that they are surprised by concrete facts that they observe, and know when to go back and reevaluate.<p>Another helpful trick is to understand that there are degrees between 0% and 100% confidence. I can entertain an proposition as being <i>possible</i> or <i>likely</i> rather than simply true or false based on the recognition that I have incomplete information. If you tried to take this approach you couldn&#x27;t derive anything logically because you would just have a multitude of possibilities in front of you. Formal logic only works with statements that are 100% true. Otherwise you&#x27;re stuck with Bayesian reasoning, which is even more mentally taxing to derive information from.<p>(Or, as an alternative response)<p>Please derive for me, from &quot;first principles&quot;, why it is imperative to build one&#x27;s mental model from first principles.",1418699521

This fear is likely overblown, but I&#x27;ve certainly never heard of anyone excited to hear that their competitor has published a patent because they hope that the new information revealed in the patent will help them to innovate better.<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s industry specific, but I&#x27;ve don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever even heard someone claim that they learned something from a patent that they could not have legally learned in some other way.

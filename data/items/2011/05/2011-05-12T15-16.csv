I don't think it's a huge problem if you explain where this key is shown inside the app. Speaking of distraction-free ""buy now"" webpage a reasonable solution I came up with the following solution: 
just ask for user e-mail (it's already provided by systems like PayPal anyway). Generate a random ""user id"" (better make it numeric) and send it to the user's e-mail along with activation instructions. Then user must go to another webpage on your site and enter 3 pieces of information: e-mail, id and the program key (the last one must be shown by the application). This page, if all goes well (the info is checked against the database records), generates an activation key to be entered to activate the program, which is also e-mailed (not just displayed on the webpage). This way you can control the piracy issue (because everything goes via e-mail, and also know/conrtol # of activations per user, since last step can be performed multiple times).",1305213860

Last May, bored of my job and frustrated at my career progress, I took the paths most travelled and quit my job to wander around the world. Along the way, I picked up ruby/rails and javascript because I want to transition into web programming. The learning curve was steep coming from the hardware world. Plus running from city to city also made it tough to maintain focus. 2 months ago, after many false starts and months of distraction, I finally decided to push it through completion.<p>gistpoint is a web app that lets you search and submit summaries for online articles. It's unique in that it has a scorer that rates how relevant a summary is compared to its fulltext. This is done by analyzing several factors such as information coverage, sentence grammar, word stemming, etc. So the best summary will rise to the top and gets shown as the default. No signup/login is needed to submit summaries, and quality is controlled without voting. When no user-submitted summary is available, it will extract the most relevant passage from the fulltext. From my experience if I just naturally summarize an article I just read, the scorer rates it highly compared to the extracted one.<p>Please let me know what you think. If anyone wants to know more about the scoring algorithm, I'll be happy to write a post about it. I definitely open source the summary extraction and grammar gems on github. They're already on rubygems <a href=""https://rubygems.org/profiles/50055"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rubygems.org/profiles/50055</a> for you to download, I just need to create the documentations.",1305213328

Gox using Dwolla, which has been <i>excellent</i> in my experience and only charges 25 cents per transaction. I withdrew money today and it was in my Dwolla account in less than an hour.<p>As far as using the API goes, there are still a few problems. My understanding from the #bitcoin-otc IRC channel is that there is a 30-second delay on trades on the Mt. Gox exchange. This contributes to weirdly huge sub-minute swings in the exchange rate. Two nights ago, there was a point where the rate went from $5 up to $6 and then back down to $5 within the space of a few seconds. This means that in the time it takes for the merchant to process the transaction, upload the bitcoins to the Mt. Gox exchange, and put in a sell order for the highest buy rate, the price may have changed dramatically.<p>Another problem is that the gap between the highest bid and the lowest asking price is often very large. There is no 'market rate' as of yet. So depending on when the merchant places a sell order, they may be getting a bad rate.<p>And it opens up another way for someone to manipulate the market to rip off the merchant. The highest buy order is usually placed by a bot that takes the highest non-bot buy order and increases it by something like .0001 bitcoins. The bots update their bids every minute or so. Since there are only a small number of traders in the exchange, a single large trader or group of medium-size traders could manipulate the market by placing a series of strategically high buy orders. This will drive up the overall rate, as the bots respond to the change in price by increasing their bids. (Edit: There are also bots programmed to make bids at somewhat <i>less</i> than the highest buy order, which would contribute to the illusion of a legitimate upward movement in the price, as all of those bots chase after the highest price.) Within just a few minutes, they can increase the highest bid by a significant amount (say $1 USD), and then place a bitcoin order for real goods and services with the merchant, knowing that they use an automatic system to exchange bitcoins for USD at the inflated market price. But during the time it takes the merchant to get their bitcoins into Mt. Gox's system and sell them, the price will have dropped back down as the fraudsters stop making inflated buy orders.",1305213133

The startup founder is unlikely to see the light so quickly.<p>How to break free of the delusion? Maybe by pondering the opportunity costs of not pursuing a new startup worth at least 2x (pick a reasonable concrete number) of your current one? Using real, achievable numbers might make it easier to take that leap of faith.<p>I think most dead startups suffer from ""a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"" syndrome (sorry, had to toss in a metaphor of my own) -- knowing how difficult it was to get the ""dead"" startup off the ground, it's difficult to face starting over.<p>I was a cofounder of what I used to call ""the most successful startup that could never make any money"". We got press consistently, did some cool partnerships with big companies (always free), and were driving steadily away from any kind of a revenue model. My partner got stubborn and, frankly, arrogant about the business, despite its professional amateur status, and I had to finally leave. He could not be made to see the light, no matter what I or anyone else said. Now he runs it as a calling card to get himself speaking gigs at conferences.<p>After writing this down, I'm not sure there was anything I could have said to convince him to spend his time any other way. He's not a math person, so opportunity costs are lost on him. There was nothing I could do but let him man the boat alone and drift off into the night.",1305212861

So, not wanting to sit idly by, we built a site and a PhoneGap / jQuery Mobile app for Android and iOS to let the public do their own reporting.<p>The project is composed of:<p>A CouchDB backend hosted by couchone.com
A Django-based site which uses makes use of Celery, S3 for photo storage and CouchDBKit for integration with CouchDB
jQuery Mobile based apps wrapped with PhoneGap for iOS and Android which talk directly to CouchDB  photos are pushed to CouchDB from the phone, pulled down by Celery, resized and pushed to S3.<p>I'd love to hear what you think.

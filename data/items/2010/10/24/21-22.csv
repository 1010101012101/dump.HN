1827431,comment,1826471,1827197,0,0,AdrenGarage,,,"I agree.  I think this is the only way we'll see live pro sports on the internet in the near future.<p>The networks know that live sports is the goose that laid the golden egg.  NFL US TV contracts are worth $3 Billion each year, NBC paid $800MM for the Olympics, and don't forget the Super Bowl commands the most expensive ad rates of any programming of the year, followed by the NBA Championships, World Series and NCAA Basketball Tournament.  That's certainly an investment the Networks will protect until their last breath.  Until online advertising markets mature, they won't want to do anything that could possibly undercut their revenue.  That's exactly why NBC, CBS and ABC blocked access to Google TV, but this is only more true in live sports.<p>My experience as a TV Producer is that the networks still look at the internet as a worse version of TV: less profitable, less quality and more unworthy competition cluttering the space.  They occupy a shrine-like position in almost every household in the world.  Why should they share it?  They want to use the internet to supplement to their current offerings rather than use it to replace their business model.  They certainly aren't going to aid anyone else to do otherwise.<p>Google TV, IMO, is doomed to ""hobby"" status unless it gets quality content either better or altogether not available on TV.  I would argue that Apple succeeded with the iPod because they created a content ecosystem (iTunes) around the device that no other device had.  Content was the ultimate deciding factor in a number of technological innovations: Beta v. VHS, HDVD v. Blu-ray, etc.  You Tube alone is not enough.<p>If Google really wants their TV to succeed, they may have to get into the content business in a serious way.  Live sports, as the most valuable programming on TV, is the most obvious target.",1287957251

1827366,comment,1827135,1827135,0,0,colinsidoti,,,"AJAX, how it's commonly referred to now, is simply the process of loading content from an external page into a Javascript variable.  Most of the time it's not even AJAX anymore, but rather AJAJ (Asynchronous Javascript and JSON). In terms of getting started there really isn't much to learn, especially if you have some experience with jQuery.<p>The big thing you need to remember is the A: Asynchronous.  Especially if you're new to programming, this won't make any sense to you.  As you use it you'll just get frustrated about why it works the way it does.  It takes a bit of experience to learn to use it well, so give it some time.  Remember these two key tips:\n    1. The code following your AJAX call should not be dependent on the content you are loading.  Javascript will continue running line by line after the AJAX request is sent, NOT after the content has been loaded.  If any code is dependent on the loaded content, it belongs in the return function.\n    2. The return function for an AJAX call only has the data from the page it loaded, it cannot* see the variables you defined before you made the request.<p>Other than that, just realize that the true power of AJAX comes from the data you're loading in.  You can use it to create an <iframe> of sorts that simply loads pre-built HTML files into a div, but that's not all that exciting.  If you use something like PHP to process and load data, you can start to make some very cool applications.  If you're looking for a good learning project, I would recommend creating a simple ""shoutbox"" that works completely with AJAX, including periodic refreshes to check for new comments.<p>If you don't know what a shoutbox is:  <a href=""http://www.shoutmix.com/main/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shoutmix.com/main/</a>\nSome jQuery functions to check out: .load(), .post(), .get(), .ajax()<p>*: A lot of times, your return function WILL be able to see variables you defined before the AJAX request because they ended up in the global scope.  I'd recommend that you don't rely on this unless your making the variable global on purpose.  Otherwise, there's a lot of potential for a debugging nightmare.",1287956026

The game has an opening, a middle-game, and an end-game. You can take them as metaphors for the stages of life.<p>The opening involves playing in the corners and around the edges of the board, perhaps on the third line emphasising territory, or on the fourth line emphasing influence. Metaphorically this is childhood and education. Perhaps going for a vocational qualification, such accounting or law is like going for territory, while studying philosophy or travelling round the world is like going for influence. Or perhaps such direct parallels are over-literal. The opening moves in a game are worse than difficult; the opening is down-right mysterious. Which makes it a lot like growing up. And it creates a situation as you enter the middle game that is different in every game. Much as every adult has their own baggage left over from childhood.<p>Perhaps the middle game is like adult life because things keep going wrong. Your opponent invades your territory or steals the eyes from a group. You have to fight back, invade his territory or sacrifice a weak group. Adult life makes similiar demands on your flexibility and fighting spirit. If you lose your job perhaps you can find a new one with a rival company for more pay. Or change career and become happier.<p>The middle game may see victory or defeat, just as life may come to a premature end in illness or death. Often though one survives to the end game. The boundaries of the territories must be decided and there is still time for ingenuity and an upset. It is the time of memoirs and collected works, of playing with grand-children and of making partial amends for past errors.<p>If you play in tournaments there is a clock, but it is set to 1 hour, not seventy years. There is time to think about your opening, to estimate the score and plan a path in the middle game, to look for some clever moves and to save time here and there with the obvious safe play. After 40 minutes you can estimate the score again. If you think you are ahead you can try to hold onto your lead through the end game. If you think you are behind you must chose between trying to catch up with some clever end game moves or perhaps a do or die invasion. Time matters. If you are short of time you will be unlikely to be able to think for long enough to come up with clever moves. But you should be ahead, having put the time to good use earlier.<p>Tournament play with 1 hour instead of 70 years is the heart of the metaphor. Both the game and real life have a narrative arc and time limits. You have to manage your time and act your age, taking the big points in the opening and leaving the end-game moves for the end-game, if you make it that far.<p>So my advice is practical advice and not the uplifting advice that you requested. It emphasises the practical issue of getting the hang of managing a limited stock of time.",1287954958

A higher sense of purpose other than being liked.<p>5. A way of saying much with few words (the ""genius of compression"").<p>6. The ability to discern between ""the idea"" and ""the packaging"".<p>7. A great fear of ever saying in private what they would never say in public.<p>8. An aversion to announcing things in advance.<p>Rather than being ""on time"", a professional seeks to be ""before time"". Rather than trying to ""get to the point"", the professional ""starts with the point"". A professional is more concerned with examining and testing and adjusting motives, than learning methods.<p>Above all, a professional gives value to ""voice"". The idea that playing a violin well will eventually result in greater resonance, that every note contributes to the tone of the instrument. The professional chooses to produce true notes as much as possible, knowing that false notes played in practice will eventually come to light in the character of the instrument. A professional understands why orchestra conductors insist on punctuality, the first and second and third order effects thereof. How ""bottomless wonders spring from simple rules... repeated without end."" - Benoit Mandelbrot.<p>Ask a professional why they chose to take a particular course of action, and they will be able to tell you ""why"". Professionals are rational, and their rationality is proactively forthcoming. Professionals phrase things in the positive.<p>Most of these characteristics seem to come down to ""words"" and ""voice"" and ""reasons"".",1287954738

Taxi licenses are very expensive and a lucrative revenue source for every major city. A taxi seat can cost as much as 1 million to purchase in NYC, and I know other cities such as SF and LV are not much cheaper due to the fixed number of licenses. I can only imagine the outrage of other cab drivers losing work to cheaper services (i.e. UberCab) because they are not paying licensing fees.<p>3. UberCab can easily recover albeit at lower margins.

8598120,comment,8596785,8598027,0,0,biot,,,"This has long been a pet peeve of mine when it comes to online articles. I see the appeal for printed magazines because, if people are flipping pages, a large pull quote might catch their attention and get them to start reading. But for an online article, the fact that I&#x27;m scrolling down means that I <i>am</i> reading. And if I&#x27;m reading, there&#x27;s nothing more annoying than re-reading the exact sentence that I just read.<p>If you want to do more intelligent pull quotes, paraphrase the quotes and use them as headings. For example:<p><pre><code>   ... And then, Reader, I clicked on it.\n\n   <div class=&quot;pullquote&quot;>The Container Store is my kind of porn</div>\n\n   I&#x27;d been looking for a new job for months, the search wasn&#x27;t going\n   as well as I&#x27;d planned, and The Container Store, let&#x27;s be honest, \n   is my kind of porn. ...\n</code></pre>\nThis has the advantage of piquing someone&#x27;s curiosity (&quot;Why is the Container Store a kind of porn for this person?&quot;) and they can carry on to read the following paragraph to find out why. For the next pull quote:<p><pre><code>   <div class=&quot;pullquote&quot;>A job with benefits is a unicorn</div>\n</code></pre>\nOf course, it too appears above the paragraph that mentions it. The point is to set the stage for what you&#x27;re about to read, not just regurgitate in a large, bold font the text you <i>just</i> read... which wastes peoples&#x27; time.",1415825991

Then the time they spend sifting through the article, they read more of it, and (if it&#x27;s a good article) they become more enticed into buying the magazine, as the newstand clerk scowls at them, because what is this? A library? No reading!<p><pre><code>  But damn it! I need to know the whole joke! \n  I guess I&#x27;ll just buy it an read the rest on the train...\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s how those things are supposed to work.

I never worry about losing my files.\n4) Smart phones were not life changing, but they did save the annoyance of printing directions and then carrying a moleskin, crossword puzzle, paperback book, etc, everywhere I go.\n5) Yelp and Amazon reviews are so much more extensive now, making accessing high quality products so much easier.\n6) Goole maps now support transit directions. Finding the right city bus or set of stops to take when traveling is much easier.<p>Some things have gotten worse. I think newsgroups+AIM+IRC+blogs&RSS were better than Twitter/Facebook/Reddit.

If the author had signed up for an individual plan under Obamacare within the 60 day period from when she lost her job, she would have at least had health insurance, and if she remained unemployed, she would qualify for increasingly large subsidies.<p>In the olden days (before 2013) you had to sign up for COBRA to stay insured unless you were healthy enough to qualify for individual insurance. But now you can&#x27;t be turned down, but you can only sign up during specific enrollment periods. Problem is, COBRA is still around, and companies are still required to offer it to you, even though for most people it&#x27;s going to be way more expensive than individual insurance (because it&#x27;s unsubsidized), and if something goes wrong or you become unable to afford the premiums, you can end up like the author, unable to sign up for an individual plan because you&#x27;re out of the enrollment period.<p>This is one of a few holes and pitfalls that were created by the Affordable Care Act.<p>I know a lot about this stuff because my startup helps companies save money and design health benefits programs that take advantage of recent changes in the health care law (benefitter.com).

Which was always the problem with leveraging async/overlapped IO: It was too complex and it turned your application logic inside-out because everything had to be performed in callbacks. async/await takes that on directly: You get everything executed in callbacks - only the callbacks are transparently created for you along with the necessary finite state machines so that your code still composes with exceptions, loops, branches working the way you expect - even across those &quot;invisible&quot; callbacks.<p>For server scalability as well as responsiveness on small devices (keeping number of thread low - even at one - while still serving the UI), that is really an advantage.<p>There is no &quot;fakes&quot; on the way - no extra threads being started just to wait for completion of an otherwise synchronous API. If the platform supports asynchronous IO/network/disk/database you can leverage that without any of the strange complexities of other languages.<p>Worth mentioning here is that Windows has an easier scalable and better designed <i>completion</i> oriented async model compared to the <i>readiness</i> oriented model of Linux - which is mostly limited to sockets anyway.<p>OS X has GCD - which is also a completion oriented model. I look forward to seeing how .NET with real global optimizing compilers from MS will do on OS X versus Linux versos Windows (on a Mac, obviously).",1415825523

Do we ever hear the most recent fact related exactly in the same way, by the several people who were at the same time eyewitnesses of it? No. One mistakes, another misrepresents, and others warp it a little to their own, turn of mind, or private views. A man who has been concerned in a transaction will not write it fairly; and a man who has not, cannot.<p>But notwithstanding all this uncertainty, history is not the less necessary to be known, as the best histories are taken for granted, and are the frequent subjects both of conversation and writing. Though I am convinced that Caesar&#x27;s ghost never appeared to Brutus, yet I should be much ashamed to be ignorant of that fact, as related by the historians of those times. Thus the Pagan theology is universally received as matter for writing and conversation, though believed now by nobody; and we talk of Jupiter, Mars, Apollo, etc., as gods, though we know, that if they ever existed at all, it was only as mere mortal men. This historical Pyrrhonism, then, proves nothing against the study and knowledge of history; which, of all other studies, is the most necessary for a man who is to live in the world. It only points out to us, not to be too decisive and peremptory; and to be cautious how we draw inferences for our own practice from remote facts, partially or ignorantly related; of which we can, at best, but imperfectly guess, and certainly not know the real motives.</i><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=0_4kAAAAMAAJ&dq=do%20we%20ever%20hear%20the%20most%20recent%20facts%20related%20exactly%20in%20the%20same%20way&pg=PA274#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=0_4kAAAAMAAJ&dq=do%20we%20e...</a><p>or <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3361/3361-h/3361-h.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3361/3361-h/3361-h.htm</a>, but you&#x27;ll have to ctrl+f for the text.",1415825365

It had a stub page, with only basic biographic information. Checking elsewhere, I found that the FBI and IRS raided his office, home, and business some time ago. His chief of staff, his business partner, and and a former staffer that became a judge were all convicted of fraud and/or tax evasion. Other than this, his political career was a whole lot of nothing.<p>So, having done this research, I put it into the relevant Wikipedia article, with appropriate references to news articles and legal documents, carefully noting that he himself was never charged with anything. Reading between the lines, I realize that the authorities tried to get his subordinates to roll over on him, but failed - but that kind of subjectivity doesn&#x27;t belong in an encyclopedia article.<p>Anyway, less than a minute later, the change was reverted because of &quot;vandalism&quot;. Whoever reverted it had either not even glanced at the change, or was a supporter of this politician, protecting his page from negative information. Probably the former, but who knows?<p>This was the last, and worst, example of me wasting my time trying to contribute to Wikipedia. I have had every single change I have ever made to Wikipedia reverted (going back years). Sometimes I have done it anonymously, sometimes I have logged in; it doesn&#x27;t make any difference in my experience. What seems to matter is if you&#x27;re willing to put in the time to master Wikipedia&#x27;s bureaucratic procedure, which I am not. I just don&#x27;t bother anymore. So to me, this article makes perfect sense.<p>But I have to admit that I still read Wikipedia all the time. It is without question, the most useful web site there is. It&#x27;s not as comprehensive as I would like, and for subjective information it&#x27;s actually quite bad, but I think that in general it seems to be getting better over time, on both counts. So I don&#x27;t know if you can say it&#x27;s declining.<p>By the way, despite him either being a crook, or merely employing crooks on his staff, I voted for him anyway, just last week.

In other words, the difference is around one main memory reference (&quot;cache miss&quot;) between the best and the worst case.<p>While this is somewhat interesting, the lesson to take home should be that most of the time, smart memory usage is more important than what the CPU executes. Warming up the caches (e.g. __builtin_prefetch) is as efficient an optimization as rewriting and unrolling the entire loop and should be done first.

I consider myself generally <i>too</i> much of a skeptic of new things, and yet I quite regularly marvel at what&#x27;s happening.<p>It&#x27;s not that the things coming out of Silicon Valley are hugely innovative, but rather, as others have also pointed out, the growing ubiquity of all this stuff, and not just in the West.<p>Perhaps a lot of the sentiment that often seems like hubris is really vindication and excitement: vindication because all the stuff we early-adopters loved and that others didn&#x27;t understand (or even made fun of) is now used by everyone, and excitement because it means there&#x27;s a market for the stuff we&#x27;ve been working with for so long.<p>Perhaps the younger among us are mostly excited by what they see as new possibilities and what are, to them, new discoveries.<p>For example, I remember making a game for Windows and I remember how excited I was that my parents and even some colleagues were playing it! I even put the game on floppies and printed my logo on it.<p>Now, I&#x27;m teaching my younger brother programming by building the same game. The first difference this time around is that we&#x27;re using javascript and HTML/CSS. In one day I set up the basic project with him that he can push to heroku and immediately show to friends and the world, and in about two weeks he worked through a number of CodeSchools lessons and has access to vastly more resources than I do.<p>I feel happy and vindicated, in way, that my weird hobby is now practiced by someone who is not very nerdy, and my brother is getting excited about all the stuff he can imagine building <i>and</i> releasing into the wild. No need to buy floppies and hand out his game: it&#x27;s instantly accessible to <i>everyone</i> with internet and a browser.<p>Now this is just one example. Consider also the access to all kinds of roboty goodness that can be programmed with the same javascript, the fact that there&#x27;s a huge potential <i>paying</i> audience through various app stores, and the huge (but probably rather unattainable) carrot of making the next Flappy Bird or whatnot.",1415824369

8597942,comment,8596682,8596682,0,0,sparkzilla,,,"As someone building a direct competitor to Wikipedia for crowdsourced biographies and news-based pages [1], I have come to the conclusion that the wiki software while responsible for the site&#x27;s success, is also the cause of its inevitable decline.<p>The software causes almost every problem that people complain about, mainly because it lets real or imagined experts have too much power over the page. It&#x27;s simply easier for an editor to reject new information, than to go through the pain of adding it. In one case, I struggled for weeks to try to get a simple sentence into the site, only to be harassed by the site&#x27;s administrators, when I challenged a particularly ambiguous rule. Entrenched editors such as William Connolley [2] on Global Warming, act as guardians for whole sections of the site, and do not allow any dissenting opinion, censoring and minimizing views that do not suit their agenda. So much of this is simply unnecessary in a better designed system.<p>As a result of the open nature of wiki editing, Wikipedia has built up an increasingly restrictive, massive, rule set of how to reject information, which makes it increasingly difficult to add new information. Many of those rules, such as those for notability, conflict of interest, and reliable sources are ambiguous and arbitrarily applied, giving even more power to editors and admins, instead of content creators. This means that the site has become rigid and nobody wants to maintain it. The quality of pages is declining rapidly. It is also very easy to harass other people on the system, so much so that women and minorities are virtually excluded.<p>We have taken a different approach with great results. By avoiding the page-based metaphor and giving better tools to our editors have created a system that makes it easy to add information without being harassed. We also pay our writers and editors, and are implementing a revenue share system so they can actually get some benefit from their work. So far our writers have added 25,000 posts without a single edit war, and zero harassment. 80% of them are women.<p>[1] <a href=""http://newslines.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newslines.org</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Connolley"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Connolley</a>",1415824309

But once you start dealing with complex things in Clojure the language doesn&#x27;t do much for you, if you can&#x27;t fit your problem in to it&#x27;s provided toolkit the code written will actually be horrible - for example go look at core.async [1] implementation - just reading that code gives me a headache - I understand it&#x27;s complicated stuff with buffering and all but having type annotations on protocols and variables used would be extremely helpful when trying to parse that code. Types help me think more abstractly when I&#x27;m reading the code as I can take them as compiler enforced contracts and think of them in abstract terms, in dynamically typed languages complexity and the amount of things you need to be aware of is just too overwhelming IMO.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/core.async/blob/master/src/main/clojure/clojure/core/async/impl/channels.clj#L67"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/core.async/blob/master/src/main/c...</a>",1415823943

I did most of my shopping on-line.  All of my friends could be contacted via instant messengers, phone, or e-mail.  I could argue with strangers on bulletin boards.  If I were more garrulous, I could have published a personal blog.<p>There are very few things that have changed for me between then and now:<p>1. More of the bandwidth I consume is over wires, instead of via optical discs sent through the post or carried by hand.  Netflix, Amazon, Steam, and GOG have largely replaced... Netflix and Amazon.  Hmmm.<p>2. I am charged more for paid services.  I also note that the quality of these services is often not substantially improved since then; they merely represent a larger share of my budget.<p>3. I am more concerned about my privacy.  Companies are still as sloppy about protecting it as they ever were; they just collect and keep more information about us.<p>4. DRM schemes are more pervasive and annoying.  Casual copyright infringement is easier than ever.<p>5. My video card can push out more hi-res triangles at 60 fps.<p>6. My oldest still-in-use computer is 6 years older, and is more likely to be replaced due to its relatively high power draw than its inability to run newer software.<p>The last 15 years have been a predictable series of minor improvements on existing technologies, enabled largely by cheaper and more capable hardware, and pushed out to a progressively larger audience.  This has been accompanied by aggressive attempts to squeeze more blood out of drier stones.<p>10 years ago, Sam&#x27;s question would have appeared as a link on Slashdot, and parent post would be (+5, Insightful).

Typically, if you found a startup and it goes under, you pick yourself back up and just get a job at a different startup or a big corp. However, I&#x27;m not so sure that this strength exists in the world of atoms to the same extent as in the world of bits. Perhaps it&#x27;s because non-digital skills are less fungible, or perhaps it&#x27;s because the valley is so crowded by the digital crowd that there in no room for a critical mass of atom-wranglers, but I suspect that the typical failure path for non-digital startups involves leaving the valley, or at least leaving the startup ecosystem.<p>Perhaps Sam could speak more to this difference between the worlds of bits and atoms in the future.  I know that YC is looking to do more innovative work in the world of atoms, and I laud this. I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;m not the only one who has noticed how much more successful the valley has been at bits than atoms since the 90s. I know that VCs would like to do more innovation with the atoms. But silicon valley seems to lack something when it comes to atoms that they have with bits. It&#x27;s not the VCs; they are present and ready. Maybe it&#x27;s something else.",1415823623

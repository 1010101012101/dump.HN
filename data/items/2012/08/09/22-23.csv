Even if we stipulate that Firefox would be more mature/popular without the rewrite, I think there are many decisions that might have had an equal or larger impact. For example, the design choices they made for their plugin architecture made it harder to compete when Chrome came along, and have had deep influence on their ability to do frequent unobtrusive releases. If you admit one counterfactual you must admit them all. Was the rewrite really the biggest turning point in their trajectory?<p>3. If you'd offered the firefox creators the level of success it has today, they would take it in a heartbeat. Quibbling about levels of success is a luxury you can only afford after you have managed to not die.

4363778,comment,4360271,4360271,2,0,digisth,,,"Fun thread. My first computer mischief experience was in ""Computer Class"" in first grade. The computers were running DOS 3.0 (IIRC) and the class was for teaching computer basics, which mainly consisted of ""Introduction to programming"" using Basic (with a gentle introduction to I/O, variable assignment, and flow control.) The way the class worked was: an assignment was printed out and handed out to all the students. You followed the steps and at the end of class, the teacher would look at your output to see if you did everything correctly. I finished these assignments pretty quickly, so I used the time to figure out how to exit the editor, find the ""hidden"" games stash, play them for a bit, and then get my work back up on my screen before the end of class. Pretty soon I was being asked by all the other students how to perform this feat on their own computers. I showed them, and so every time the teacher would leave the room, everyone started playing the games.<p>We also never got caught. Wild times in first grade, let me tell you.",1344552965

One book, possibly one of Peter Norton's, covered the partition table in sufficient detail.  (And I was hacking only one byte in it, nothing sophisticated.)  Reading and writing a disk sector in assembly was commonly covered in reference books.  So was writing a TSR to hook the timer interrupt, which I'd already done for some other purposes.  The actual logic of looping through segment B800 looking for text wasn't hard in assembly.  Overwriting and masquerading as a legit program (VSAFE) isn't a technical challenge at all.  The hacker chops were thinking my way through the detection methods and countermeasures, more so than the actual programming.<p>If I hadn't had that background, I would probably have hidden the games with less sophisticated methods.  Bury them in deep subdirectories, maybe zip them with password encryption.  And it was done for the challenge more than the results; I had a home computer that could play all the same games.<p>Anyway, I'll relate another story.<p>There was an annoying kid in my computer science classes, the type who thought he knew it all but was pretty clueless.  One day he was complaining that a game he had downloaded required more RAM than his home computer had.  I told him I'd give him a copy of a utility that would do on-the-fly compression of RAM in DOS.  (At the time, Stacker was big for disk compression, and there were real utilities that did memory compression in Windows.  So it was plausible.)<p>Of course, my ""utility"" was a trojan.  But I was subtle about it.  The trojan dropped an executable with a blank name (an Alt-255 character) and stuck a reference to it in AUTOEXEC.BAT, which was invisible and looked like a blank line.  The payload would trash the partition table, only if the system date was a month later than I originally did this, so he wouldn't be tracing the time bomb back to me.  (Yeah, this was nasty.  I was a youth with power.)  I don't know if he actually ran it or if the payload ever went off; the bomb date was in the summer after school ended.<p>But the real fun part is the postscript.  The outer trojan was in QuickBasic (the dropped payload was assembly.)  Years later, my brother was playing with QuickBasic to learn it, so I gave him a copy of my QB directory with several dozen of my programs to play with.  A few days later he tells me that his computer won't boot.  Yikes.  I put together a boot floppy with a Norton disk repair utility to start digging, and eventually notice that the partition table had some corruption that looked oddly familiar.  You guessed it, my own brother had run my old nasty trojan and got his partition table nuked!",1344550429

The choice of algorithms appears to reflect some well-known textbooks more than deep, practical knowledge arising from real experience.\n""What worries me most is that the project does not seem to be managed very well: although it has been around for nearly 10 years and has a large and active user base, it has apparently not been able to achieve and maintain a consistent level of reliability and maturity throughout. Features seem to be added haphazardly, without any long-term vision or discernible direction. Despite occasional efforts in this regard, the documentation remains patchy.\n""[...] [B]ecause of the overall quality issues, I would not want to rely on it for serious production work at this point.""\nThe book reviews I've read have generally been positive so I'm not sure if the SciPy community has any thoughts on this. Regarding the implementation of mostly ""textbook"" (standard) algorithms, I can see that this would be the case since there are large number of practitioners using and extending SciPy (in contrast, for instance in R there is a strong precedent for statistician to implement their newest algorithm in that language).",1344549677

If one is going to claim to be a designer (or profess to have wisdom enough to have a ""design tip"") then you sure as hell better understand <i>why</i> what you're suggesting is in any way true, ever.<p>If you don't understand the 2nd order explanation (at least) you've got no business trying to explain it to the masses  because you don't understand the boundary conditions.  If you <i>do</i> understand those boundary conditions, it should be reflected in the shared explanation, within reason.<p>Further, as explained in that post, the idea is wrong. It's about contrast (and, thus, dynamic range) more than it is <i>absolute color</i>. Indeed, if one wanted to be pedantic, they could point out that #000000 isn't actually real black and that no human has ever actually produced a truly black object. If one wanted to be slightly less pedantic and more particular, one could note that #000000 has a fuzzy meaning anyway as you're depending on the sensor of the image device (when/if it's captured) and then the output device  the rendering of black points (and whites) isn't the same on almost any two devices.<p>Pulling back slightly, even from a novice's perspective, the admonishment to never use black is just wrong. The point is/should be that contrast is important, but too much contrast can also be bad. Black can easily be used in such a way as to not yield overly contrasted images  it just needs to be paired with another color sufficiently dark so as to keep contrast low enough to be acceptable. That is something that happens all of the time, in digital media and otherwise. So, trying to tell anyone that ""black is bad"" without an explanation leads to stupid design decisions that are made because of incomplete or woefully imprecise understandings of one's audience.<p>You may be okay with that, but I think it's sloppy. It's the stuff that cargo cults and fads are made of  and I expect better from smart people like the author.",1344549612

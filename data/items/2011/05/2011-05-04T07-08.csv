Your point about knowing how to use your tool definitely rings true. Also interesting that you had a use case where data loss and integrity actually mattered and in real time, unlike a social network or most start ups operating today. Going with a heavy oracle system instead of trying to roll your own creative distributed architecture definitely seems to make sense in that scenario.

2513079,comment,2511929,2512467,2,0,yesbabyyes,,,"<i>The reason why older people 'cling' to old ideas is that as we age our neural pathways become calcified along current paths and connections, making it more difficult to change our minds about something. If aging were inhibited, presumably that problem would be one of the ones solved as well, so people's minds would remain as agile and flexible as they were in young adulthood, indefinitely, and hence able to change and adapt new ideas.</i><p>That's quite a leap of faith, IMO. It might be so that clinging to old ideas is a chemical ""problem"", or it might be how the brain works.<p>When studying other people, I come to the understanding that around 30 years of age, many people have decided on an ideology, decided which music they enjoy, what food they like, and many other interests. When presented with new information which might require change in that internal model, many people seem to ignore the new information rather than changing their model, because changing our internal model is hard, and it becomes harder the more elaborate our model of the world is. So, the older we get, the more elaborate our models, and the more reluctant to change we grow.<p>I'm know people are different - I am fighting this kind of stagnation in my mind every day - but I'm not convinced that the people who are most likely to become immortal are the ones that are the least prone to stagnation.

For example you might have a very expensive contract with a visits-your-house personal mechanic who you've agreed will be your exclusive car-repairer. Thus when you're hit in an accident, you automatically incur a large bill of $X, due to your pre-agreed subscription with the mechanic.

It's about our cognitive abilities, perhaps.<p>Using your metaphor I think, variable X is going to infinity _in both cases_. It's just that we operate in an environment where the infinity equals to what is a finite number (two or three digit integer) in another system.<p>Another way to put this: One can't experience anything except one's life. Therefore, life is infinite to person's subjective experience (the only experience available).<p>EDIT: Okay, I think I see where we disagree. In my view, while what you perceive may not be the ""reality"" in some absolute sense, it is the only reality for you nevertheless. And your death doesn't exist there, much like dragons or wizards. In short, yes, the fact that you can't perceive your own death means that you don't die. You seem to have different point of view.",1304493244

2513029,comment,2510964,2511185,2,0,danvet,,,"Exactly. All the time while I was studying I've lamented about contributing to open source, especially to the kernel. I've read tons of things, code, os books. I think I've teached myself a pretty good understanding of how it all works (never taking a os course at the university, majored in math).<p>Not a single patch came out of it over the course of almost 10 years (taking the time into account I dabbled around in Linux in high school).<p>Then the massive linux graphics stack rewrite broke my laptop. I've had no clue. Zero. Nada. But I've tried to fix it and actually succeeded somewhat. Then I've noticed that other stuff isn't working anymore in the new graphics stack (it was an old machine and devs were busy porting the newer chip generations). So I've started with more serious stuff. In retrospection, re-reading old mails and patches my lack of clue about the code, process and people is hilarious. But pretty soon some fools started to use my XVideo implementation (despite all the bugs) and reported problems. And I just wanted to get my laptop back into a working order with the cool new linux graphics stack.<p>I've had a reason to ship and users that bugged me. So I've shipped.<p>Now, two years later I'm a major contributor (even managed to once get a top 20 position by patches for a kernel release due to a major cleanup). In a specific area (Intel graphics memory manager) all patches are either reviewed by me or written by me.",1304493043

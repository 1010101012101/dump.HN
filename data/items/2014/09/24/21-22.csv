There are no fees associated with checks, unless you post your mail with a stamp. Otherwise, it&#x27;s the most cost effective way even if it&#x27;s classical.<p>2. Credit card transactions means landlord loses ~2.9% on every transaction. This adds up over time and rent prices go up.<p>3. Auto bill pay means getting someone&#x27;s bank account number, which requires complete trust. Yes, contracts can be signed and such but so many people do not use contracts if they live with roommates. In California, my experience of signing a legitimate contract just to live with other roommates (usually plural) is basically zero. The ones who require it are large corporations, apartment complex owners who do background checks (again, which I&#x27;ve never had) and stingy landlords.<p>4. Many owners still use legacy systems which are not automated to keep track of transactions, thus having physical and tangible check or cash makes it easier for them to keep track of this. We don&#x27;t have common, online repository set up for these small-time complex owners to move to. They&#x27;re used to the way they do things and won&#x27;t change.<p>Overall, it&#x27;s more cost-effective to collect checks, continue using legacy system and avoid transaction fees by using checks or even cash.<p>Oh, one other thing, if you have an American bank account and want to send money for free, try Chase QuickPay.

Basically you can cover a fairly large venue (100 feet or more on a side) with just 4 beacons. It depends on some of the variables of the venue -- walls, surfaces, existence of metal and glass for instance. But the point of the SDK is to provide smoothing and consistency and have the phone itself help resolve user location while beacons also continually reduce error propagation of signals. We have a team of PhD&#x27;s building this product and taking into account tons of smart data science. The ultimate goal is to have a venue covered without requiring an entire &quot;cell network&quot; of beacons. You can get greater accuracy by testing with multiple beacons per wall though. We would love your feedback on what works best for you as you iterate so we can also put these improvements into the SDK.<p>Thanks for the support!",1411594053

I used Lulu for my first book and was disappointed by their responsiveness in case of problems (note this was in 2007/8, so things probably changed since). I&#x27;ve published two books through lightning source and those got into Amazon very quickly, and have been selling quite nicely.<p>For e-books, I use a mix of things. The Kindle store is #1 in terms of revenue for me, and I guess not having a book there is akin to creating an IOS app and not publishing it on the AppStore. Having a book there is a must for discoverability. \nI still use Lulu.com to get things on the apple iBooks store and other lesser ebook stores, and to sell the PDFs online. The amount of money I earn from those places isn&#x27;t enough to justify bothering with each individual submission. For the Kindle store, the submission process is pretty straightforward and there is no need to pay Lulu commission.<p>My two latest books are in progress on leanpub. I think this is a pretty good early-access channel. They now have github support and will generate PDF, MOBI and ePub, so this fits nicely with my workflow and toolchain. Leanpub didn&#x27;t do anything special in terms of discoverability or promotion for my books, but they were a good channel to republish stuff frequently and let people buy early versions. I plan to re-do the PDF completely for print publishing, but I&#x27;ll use the MOBI and ePub they generated to sell the books directly on the Apple iBooks and Amazon Kindle stores. I think that&#x27;s going to be better than just keeping it on Leanpub, again because of discoverability.

If you place a bowling ball in the middle of the trampoline, suddenly rolling the balls straight to your friend won&#x27;t work anymore, because you need to roll them angled to account for the bowling ball in the middle of the trampoline causing the trampoline to be bent a bit so the balls will curve around the bowling ball and a person on the other side of the trampoline can then grab them and roll them back to you with the exact same speed and angle that you rolled them to that person.<p>However, if you tried to roll a tennis ball instead from the MIDDLE of the trampoline (where the bowling ball is) to your friend you would find that no matter what angle you chose you could not get the tennis ball out if you used the same speed to roll it as before. On the other hand, your friend will of course have no problem rolling tennis balls from the side of the trampoline inward to you.<p>This is the situation you find light in. Because the absolute maximum velocity that ANYTHING including light can have in a vacuum is equal to c if the black hole is bending the trampoline of space time so much that that velocity doesn&#x27;t surpass the curvature then it doesn&#x27;t matter what angle the light faces, it&#x27;s just going to end up heading right back towards the black hole.",1411593527

In other words, if I reflect a light beam back on itself, does it return to its source?<p>Yes, it would, assuming you have a way to reflect a beam back the way it came, like the kind of retro-reflectors the Apollo astronauts left on the moon. If you were an observer and saw a laser beam emanating from some distant place, and you wanted to assure that your laser beam would be most likely to be seen there, you would point it at the exact opposite heading -- assuming neither the source nor destination were in motion.<p>> Because if that&#x27;s true (and my feeble understanding is that it is true), then light can&#x27;t enter a black hole or the reverse path would allow light to escape.<p>That&#x27;s a different question with a different answer. If you point a laser beam at a surface that absorbs most or all the radiation that falls on it, it&#x27;s possible that none of the initial radiation will be returned to the source. But -- very important -- all the energy is accounted for. If the initial light beam has energy E, then the energy absorbed and reflected by the target will also equal E, not necessarily the same wavelengths but the same total energy. This applies to black holes as well -- they conserve energy.",1411593359

The &quot;before-black-hole&quot; state she describes still would involve significant time dilation and thus what we see as Hawking radiation from black hole may just be Hawking radiation from &quot;before-black-hole&quot; star. Looks the same :)<p>The result doesn&#x27;t say that black hole is impossible. It says that a star&#x27;s collapse loses mass faster than acceptable for the collapse to end in black hole.<p>Some misconceptions in the web-post:<p>>They are the ultimate unknown â€“ the blackest and most dense objects in the universe that do not even let light escape.<p>a black hole isn&#x27;t necessary most dense.

Itâ€™s the point where a black holeâ€™s gravitational pull is so strong that nothing can escape it.<p>&quot;membrane&quot; is very bad illustration. It is constantly changing solution to the gravitational equations. One moment it is here, another moment - it has moved because gravitation of black hole changes and a lot of oscillations/perturbations happen. One moment you&#x27;re inside, another - outside.<p>&quot;gravitational pull is so strong that nothing can escape it&quot; - that&#x27;s bad wording too. It is actually &quot;gravitational well is so deep that nothing can escape it&quot;.

8364169,comment,8363527,8364011,2,0,antognini,,,"If the spacetime is static, then yes, the trajectory of a light beam (or anything else) is reversible.  The question you pose is an excellent one and is one of the reasons that many physicists believed that black holes could not exist after Karl Schwarzschild discovered the Schwarzschild metric that describes spacetime around a spherically symmetric black hole.<p>So what happens if you direct a beam of light radially into a black hole?  A distant observer will calculate that as the light beam descends into the black hole it will be (according to a distant observer) progressively blueshifted until it reaches the event horizon, at which point it will have blueshifted to infinite energy.  In fact, according to the calculations of a distant observer, the light beam will never cross the event horizon, so the statement that the light beam is reversible remains true. The reason that the light beam (according to the distant observer) doesn&#x27;t cross the horizon is that if you look at the metric, it states that ds^2 = (1 - R_Schw / r) c^2 dt^2 - 1 / (1 - R_Schw / r) dr^2, where R_Schw is the radius of the event horizon.  Notice that at the event horizon r = R_Schw and the dr^2 term diverges.  The distant observer therefore concludes that there is a singularity at the event horizon.  This analysis lead physicists to initially conclude that black holes were unphysical.<p>A more careful analysis reveals that this isn&#x27;t the case, however.  We have been using this metric which describes the shape of spacetime according to a distant observer.  But what we&#x27;re really concerned with is not what a distant observer calculates, but how a <i>local</i> observer perceives spacetime.  If we now switch to a coordinate system in which we are free falling into the black hole along with the beam of light, we find that nothing remarkable happens when we cross the event horizon.  The light is blueshifted relative to its initial energy, but it doesn&#x27;t have an infinite amount of energy.  Thus there is no true singularity at the event horizon.  This singularity that the distant observer found must therefore have been an artifact of the particular coordinate system that the distant observer was using.  The free falling observer can then hold up a mirror and send off a light beam and have it return back to him even after they have crossed the event horizon.",1411592937

He can&#x27;t be bothered to worry about what he&#x27;s going to eat. Not many of us can make meaningful comparisons between our day-to-day and that of the POTUS, but I certainly envy the convenience of having my meals chosen for me. Cooking requires making a number of additional decisions. You suggest finding a recipe online. OK, well it will probably require ingredients that I don&#x27;t have. Finding a satisfactory solution to the problem of choosing a recipe that maximizes tastiness and health, while minimizing grocery shopping and cooking hassle takes at least ten minutes for me. Inevitably, I need to buy four or five ingredients. Using up the leftover ingredients will further complicate future meal choices. Furthermore, cooking requires planning ahead of time unless you want to make a (10 minute minimum) trip to the store every day.  So now I have to set aside 2-3 hours every week to make a meal plan, write a shopping list, and buy ingredients? Add an hour or more if you are not lucky enough to have a grocery store near your daily commute. And now I need cabinet and refrigerator space for all this and counter space to prepare the meal on.<p>Cooking&#x27;s easy for you. Congratulations! It&#x27;s not for me.

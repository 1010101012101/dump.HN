You will <i>never</i> see a market level salary or even a raise, and once that 2% equity has been through dilution it will be more like 0.2% at most. Sorry, but there&#x27;s no way this situation will play out well for you. Another thing you probably don&#x27;t want to hear is that you are not &quot;senior level&quot; if you lack the experience to have figured this out for yourself. Not even close.<p>You can learn from this and never be played like a sucker again, but many people it takes 2 or 3 goes around to realize.

I am at 2% equity which he says is more than any other employer but I&#x27;m not sure what my next move is.

9595608,comment,9591124,9595483,0,0,azth,,,"There are lot of baseless and uncited claims in your post. The blog post you cited took a few verses from the Quran, and attempted to deduce rulings out of them, without going back to what scholars know.<p>> For some reason this is not happening.<p>Maybe something for you to research and find out why (hint, because Islam preserves life, and its goal is not to kill left and right, like how you&#x27;re trying to make it seem to be). The death penalty in Islam is very, very strict, applicable to only a couple of situations, and can only be done by the government. Even then, people are encouraged to forgive if they are in a position to do that.<p>> There is not a single mention of a headscarf anywhere in either the quran or the hadith.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for the literal word &quot;headscarf&quot; then yes (at least for the Quran). However, covering up (what is known as the headscarf today) is required in Islam. There is not enough space here to discuss this issue, it is sufficient to know that the Muslim women during the time of the Prophet Peace be upon him, practiced this.<p>> For instance, there is a death penalty for muslims who choose not to live under islamic rule.<p>I would like to see the source of that claim.<p>> And no, the law does not mention the case that there is no islamic state.<p>Just because there is no Caliphite state today, does not mean that there are no Islamic states. Nowhere in the sources is it stated that a Caliphite system is the exclusive way to have an Islamic state. In one Hadith, the Prophet Peace be upon him mentioned that the Caliphite period after him will be 30 years, then it will turn into kingdoms. There are dozens of Hadiths that tell people to have patience, and not to overthrow their governments, even if those governments are messing around with some religious rulings (e.g. delaying prayers until after their time). There are only two cases where it is permissible to overthrow the ruling government, none of which apply to any of the countries of the so called Arab Spring today.<p>We also have Hadiths that describe people with mentalities similar to what we see in ISIS today. One of these Hadiths calls such people the dogs of Hell fire.<p>> That I am a racist if I think otherwise.<p>I don&#x27;t see what racism has to do with any of this. You&#x27;re free to believe what you want, but it seems that the vast majority of what you believe about this topic is based on either no evidence at all, or on deliberately misconstrued &quot;interpretations&quot;, which can be easily dismissed by a learned individual.<p>> How much does it really match the religion&#x27;s instructions ?<p>It goes against it 100%. The Prophet Peace be upon him told us not to overthrow our rulers, regardless of how bad they get. They have absolutely no religious basis to their actions; none of the nearby countries recognize them as a legitimate government; we have Hadiths describing people like them.<p>> Islamic ideology glorifies this war of the prophet against the Roman Empire, and the Jewish and other states bordering it...<p>He did not wage war for the sake of waging war. This is another misconstrued view you have of Islamic history. In ALL of the wars that happened during his time, it was to either fend off an attacking enemy, or it was after a peace treaty was broken by the other party.<p>> and describes it as a war that can and should only end with total worldwide victory of the religion.<p>* <a href=""http://quran.com/49/13"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quran.com/49/13</a><p>* <a href=""http://quran.com/10/99"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quran.com/10/99</a><p>> keep in mind that islamic marriages are arranged<p>Again, more uncited claims. Arranged (i.e. forced) marriages are against Islamic teachings. Them happening in Muslim countries does not mean these practices were derived from the religion (basic correlation vs. causation fallacy).<p>That being said, I don&#x27;t disagree that there are many misconceptions that are spread in the Islamic world, about certain rulings or teachings, that in fact, are not from Islam. It is important to educate people about what is and isn&#x27;t from Islam.",1432453156

9595573,comment,9594786,9595436,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"Uh yeah,<p>The plan sounds wildly implausible because of the immense expense involved. A modern house today costs crudely about 295K to build. To build housing for 35,000 would start at about 10 billion but would probably be several times that for the other amenities. Add to that the fact that, because this won&#x27;t be a city, everything will be built by companies from out of town, further increasing the costs.<p>Just as much, unoccupied dwellings and infrastructure require maintenance, sometimes more maintenance than occupied areas since cars driving on streets is what stops grass (or tumble-weeds) from growing, etc.<p>Moreover, what would it be a model of? The lack of residents would also mean everything would be fairly different from an occupied city.<p>Testing autonomous vehicles sounds reasonable but it&#x27;s hard to see that or other hypothetical uses needing an entire purposes built city. A &quot;smart grid&quot; test would require a working power grid. Would you have an unoccupied city with a continuously operating power-grid?<p>If nothing else, this implausible plans makes me think how interdependent and hard-to-simulate a real, working city is.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fixr.com/costs/build-single-family-house"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fixr.com/costs/build-single-family-house</a>",1432451607

It&#x27;s a subtle difference.<p>I don&#x27;t own a TV anymore, but when I&#x27;m visiting relatives, I do watch it a bit on a rare occasion.<p>My first impression is that every show is hopelessly interspersed with frequent commercials. I don&#x27;t understand why they put up with it. <i>I</i> am the master of my attention span, not the advertisers or the broadcaster. If I&#x27;m too frequently interrupted, I lose interest and find something else to do. Traditional TV has become a non-option to me, not the least because I don&#x27;t want to arrange my life after the TV scheme.<p>My second impression is.. why the hell are they spamming me with their commercials?  Yes, I DO know about the f* product, I already DO have a favorite brand, and a commercial is not going to make me switch.<p>But sometimes, extremely rarely, I do learn about a <i>new</i> product (through any kind of ad -- TV or web) that may interest me and then I look for more information or just buy it to test it if it&#x27;s something cheap (like, e.g., a new coke edition).",1432450950

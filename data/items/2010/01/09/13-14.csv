A negotiator who presents himself as the decision-maker has put himself at a severe bargaining disadvantage. You have to put your ego on the back burner to do this, but you'll find it very effective.<p>""...When the other person knows that you have the final authority to make a deal, he knows that he only has to convince you... Not so if you are telling him that you have to answer to a higher authority. Whether you have to get approval from a region, head office, management, partners, or board of directors, the other person has to do more to convince you... He knows that he must completely win you to his side so that you want to persuade your higher authority to agree to his proposal.""<p>You also buy time to review any proposal that is made, or look for counteroffers, because that proposal has to be taken away behind the scenes and shown to the higher authority for approval.<p>Note, however, that your family isn't the best choice for this: ""be sure that your authority is a vague entity, such as a pricing committee, the people back at corporate, or the marketing committee. If you tell the other person that your manager would have to approve it, what's the first thought that they are going to have? Right: 'Then why am I wasting time talking to you?'...""<p>Of course, the flip side of that is that a company might find it exceedingly awkward to demand that your wife come in to work and participate in the negotiations. Such things are just not done. So the ""wife"" version of the gambit does work better than the ""manager"" version, though nowhere near as well as the ""ambiguous corporate overlords"" version.<p>People often allege -- correctly, I fear -- that some companies prefer to hire single people rather than people with families. And here we have the reason: Having a family automatically, perhaps even unconsciously, puts you in a stronger negotiating position with your employer, not just at the beginning of the job but day-to-day. ""Oh, how I would love to spend the entire weekend fixing my co-worker's bugs, but my child needs me."" If you are a single person and your employer knows it I encourage you to invent some fictional relatives. For an astonishingly relevant guide to this, see Wilde, Oscar: <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i>.",1263045550

Shoes lying haphazardly. Afghans partially off the couch and touching the floor.<p>The point isn't that I have a messy house, but that it's really difficult to isolate one function, say swiffering, and make it work, because it's related to a bunch of other functions, like putting out the cat, or picking up the living room.<p>Perhaps it makes sense in a bigger, more empty house, filled by people who don't leave lots of things askew. Don't know.<p>I'm betting in 10-15 years we'll start seeing some multi-function household robots -- perhaps that can pickup and clean. Once they reach 3 or 4 related functions instead of just one, I can see them making more sense.",1263045291

It's hard enough for me to grow up as is; it's especially harder if you still love being immature (yet playful) towards your peers and are older than twenty-two.<p>EDIT: I've been fired from a marketing firm for forgetting to remove my test word 'Poopy' from a Fortune500 company's web-site (running on WebLogic, yikes). No one knew the word was there for like a week since 'Poopy' was not an actual product it only showed up in their glossary. A week later I told my boss after releasing the next update and removing the test word: she flipped out, told the client, and fired me that following Monday because word got around their (the client's) IT department resulting in someone digging up a cached copy of their web-site's glossary and passing it on to someone higher up the corporate ladder. I'm an idiot for using such a <i>vulgar</i> test word but I had no business working there (in a marketing firm), let alone no business editing 14,000-20,000 lines of XML. (seriously, there were about 3-4 XML files that long) In retrospect though, I'm glad it happened because now (then) I finally had a reason to learn Mercurial (or why version-control is important and how branching could have saved my ass) :P",1263045239

Because it's easy to explain citizens that you are going to tax a foreign company. Easier than telling them that they will have to pay yet another tax.

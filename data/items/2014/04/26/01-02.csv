7650102,comment,7647571,7649593,7,0,darkmighty,,,"If they&#x27;re aggressive enough, I&#x27;d say there could justifiably be a quite large latency. Say for example their block size is 55 disks with 10% redundancy. Then the seek time is the maximum seek time of the lowest 50 seek times within the set of disks which haven&#x27;t failed. Now there&#x27;s a queue to read each drive, and it may very well frequently be a huge maximum  queue pretty much every time. Even if the queue is typically short, they would still have to show a typical high value, which I&#x27;d say is essentially read time of an entire disk.<p>Now factor that the disks are both large and crappy. A 120 Mb/s read speed and 1Tb disk size would imply 8000 secs ~ 2 hours. Factor possibility of differential pricing as you mentioned (even longer queues), and you may get an upper bound of 3 or 4 hours.<p>I&#x27;m just speculating though.",1398477592

I know from speaking to my advisor that the level of spam he receives is much greater, and often contains names that sound foreign to him. Even worse, these emails are somewhat generic in ways that resemble the form letter in this study. Normally, when a prospective grad student is interested in working with you, at least in the field I&#x27;m in (psychology), they mention something about your interests when contacting, rather then a generic form-looking email.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that this makes not responding to emails from minority students okay. I wonder to what degree professors might see something that is not personalized, from a name which is &quot;similar&quot; to other names they associate with spam, and decide not to respond.<p>Andy Gelman has a good example of the kind of spam that comes in: <a href=""http://andrewgelman.com/2014/04/05/bizarre-academic-spam/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andrewgelman.com/2014/04/05/bizarre-academic-spam/</a>",1398477279

The vigil was attended by homeless advocates of all political stripes, had a local police officer singing at the beginning and end, and a gubernatorial candidate was around as well. The &quot;issue of homelessness&quot; is definitely complicated, and amongst the crowd tonight, all holding candles, were those who take stands for rental vouchers, more conservative &quot;housing first&quot; policies, expanded mental health care, and a few other approaches. There were plenty of compassionate Christian conservatives there who I appreciate for their emphasis on pragmatism and on human dignity, even though the solutions run against their deeply held political beliefs.<p>As someone who has always felt just a day a way from slipping into homelessness myself, including struggling with alcoholism - the one thing I can say for certain is that the only way to address this is by continuing to address the issue honestly, trying the best we can with evidence of what works. I wish I could say I trust my faculties, but week to week its obvious I have a problem, even back when I was 9 years into sobriety..<p>In America, we definitely err on the side of personal liberty and responsibility, and though I agree with that in some abstract sense, it is obvious to me that moralizing the issue as one of choice, or as one of laziness vs. hard work and determination, is a failure. We can do better, and we will, but in the process we&#x27;re going to have to accept responsibility for each other in a costly and politically inconvenient way.<p>The fact that people came out tonight in my hometown to celebrate our common humanity, despite another tragic loss, is admirable. It is what defines us as a human family. Although the circumstances anger me personally, all these people tonight, and the people here on HN, prove there is a solution, even if it is a hard process and not a clear destination.",1398474726

92902,comment,92716,92896,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"What I'm seeing is people dropping one onerous system -- say traditional waterfall -- and creating a new onerous system built around favorite authors and books. I think people get the ""feeling"" of agile but miss out on really how it is supposed to work. I mean, I'm seeing customers quoting books back and forth to each other -- even calling in famous authors to make decisions on what they should be doing. Famous authors, bless their hearts, don't know jack squat about any particular team or project and shouldn't be making blanket announcements about what teams ""ought"" to do. That's the same stuff they're trying to get away from. There are no perfect answers.<p>\nI come from the rational side of agile as well. This is the first time I've seen so many people so excited about giving teams freedom that they're prepared to spell out exactly what those teams should do in order to be free. If you only concentrate on delivering code you miss the other value you add. Teams can't run on manifestos and slogans.",1198733287

My awesomeness cannot be contained.<p>I spotted an immediate opportunity as soon as they opened up the box of trouble that is a baseless lawsuit against IBM.  I shorted SCO during their long decline.  It took longer than I expected, and I bought to cover before the end (which still hasn't quite come), because I wanted to avoid more tax hassle (I was short on SCO something like three years ago, and the end really hasn't come yet).  I personally followed SCO from before all of the trouble, because of some intellectual property issues I had with them, so I already knew they play fast and loose with copyright and IP (I won't go into detail, because I'm pretty sure the non-disclosure from the settlement is still in effect).",1198733175

92894,comment,92792,92879,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I'm not about to defend the Crusades or the Spanish Inquisition! However there are certain differences between say, Europe in the year 1200 and any random warrior nomadic tribe of the same time. I keep getting back to private property rights, which I believe is the foundation of all western civilization. Also the religious insistence on personal responsibility (as opposed to blind submission) was nascent even at that point. And the Magna Carta showed that the idea of governance being a two way street. These themes bloomed into the Reformation, which kicked off the 100 years war, which got us modern secularism, which enhanced the renaissance and set the stage for all those miracles that happened in the last 400 years or so. I would tell you to wait for the movie, but it would be something like a 200-hour serial or something just for the highlights.<p>\nYou hit on an interesting startup topic, though. Is it possible to algorithmically determine cultures and sub-cultures by biometrics, writing analysis, web sites visited, or some other factor? Aside from the big brother implications, there's actually a real market need -- people who belong to the same ""clans"" usually like spending time together on the web. Any way to make that easier should have value. In the information age, it's very possible that people belong to some sub-culture that they are not even aware of.",1198732546

A huge part of why it's worked on Digg/Reddit is because users are motivated to pollute existing news stories with Ron Paul talk. Having a section dedicated to Ron Paul takes away that motivation.<p>Your site seems extremely biased, and would be one I would not visit if I were looking for level headed, balanced news. And if I wanted otherwise, I'd stick to Digg/Reddit.<p>Congrats on launching.",1198732022

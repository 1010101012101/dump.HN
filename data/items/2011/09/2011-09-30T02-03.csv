3055386,comment,3054912,3055341,1,0,TomOfTTB,,,"> How high? And how is it a straw man? A straw man is a false argument that someone uses to make another person's position seem weak in a debate. I don't see that happening here.<p>I suspect it's around where they were during the Clinton presidency.  But I honestly don't know.  And if we were making policy rationally instead of trying to demonize one side or the other what we'd be doing is trying to find that out.<p>As for the term Straw Man what you're saying when you says ""raise taxes"" is ""The answer is simple"".  You're giving the impression that the other person just doesn't want to look at the obvious answer.  My point was the tax argument is false (because we can't realistically raise taxes that high) and hence the argument that our debt is a serious problem is not a weak one.<p>> Your link shows the opposite. Per capita tax receipts have grown 250% over the last sixty years according to that chart.<p>Consistent is relative I'll grant you that.  But the point is when the top tax rate was around 90% tax receipts were lower.  So in comparison to our wildly fluctuating tax policy the receipts have been relatively consistent.<p>> How high do you think that is? Right now receipts are well south of 20% of GDP. Currently revenue would have to be doubled, but outlays typically increase and revenues decrease during a recession. If you look at the non-recession tax rates that would be needed to close that gap in, e.g., the Bush years, it would have only taken a 5-10% increase, which hardly seems as outrageous as you're making it out to be<p>Right now you're just making up numbers so I can't really debate your point.  5-10% of what?  Income tax?  Capital Gains?  If you combine National + Average State debt for each American the number comes out to around $150,000 per tax payer with interest.  That is not something that is going to be solved with a 5-10% increase on anyone.",1317350960

Take a look at the Columbia River Crossing project between Oregon and Washington states - six years after project inception, the final environmental impact study still hasn't been released.

3055364,comment,3055154,3055154,74,0,stephenjudkins,,,"On one hand, I agree with him. The software ecosystems we work in have a whole lot of needless and incidental complexity. I could go on and on about the insanely and overly complicated things that developers -- especially ones like Ryan Dahl -- have to deal with all the time.<p>On the other hand, it's arrogant for one to think that he or she could do it that much better than the next guy. Writing efficient, maintainable, and ""simple"" software requires adding layers of indirection and complexity. You have to use your best judgment to ask whether the new layer you're adding will make things ultimately cleaner and simpler for future generations of programmers, or will hang like a millstone around their necks for years to come.<p>Let's try a little thought experiment: go back a few decades to the early 80s. Propose to build node.js as a tool to make it much easier for developers to write real-time network applications. You'll need to design a prototype-based dynamic language, itself an extremely difficult (and dare I say complicated) task. The implementation will need a garbage-collector, a delicate, complicated, and cumbersome piece of code to write. To make it acceptably fast, you'll need to write a JIT, which traces and profiles running code, then hot-swaps out JITted routines without missing a beat. You'll need to write a library which abstracts away event-based IO, like the ""libev"" node.js uses. That will require kernel support.<p>Frankly, even forgetting about relative CPU power at the time, I think you'd be laughed out of the room for proposing this. All of these things, for production systems, were extremely speculative, ""complicated"" things at the time they were introduced. People can't predict the future, and they obviously have difficulty predicting what tools will become useful and simple, and which will become crufty tarpits of painful dependencies and incidental complexity. No one in 1988 could say ""a dynamic, prototype-based, garbage-collected language paired with a simple event model will allow developers to create simple real-time network applications easily in 2011"". Many of them probably had high hopes that C++ templates would deliver on the same vision by then. But, instead, we have Boost.<p>Further, it's <i>extremely</i> arrogant of Dahl to create a dichotomy between those who ""just don't yet understand how utterly fucked the whole thing is"" and those, like him, with the self-proclaimed power of clear vision to see what will help us tame and conquer this complexity. Who knows, maybe in 15 years we'll be saddled with tons of crufty, callback-soup, unreliable node.js applications we'll all have to maintain. I don't think James Gosling envisioned the mess that ""enterprise Java"" became when he designed the initial simple language. Most developers do many of the things he cites, like  adding ""unnecessary"" hierarchies to their project, because they believe it will help them in conquering complexity, and leave something simple and powerful for others to use down the line.",1317350576

A straw man is a false argument that someone uses to make another person's position seem weak in a debate. I don't see that happening here. (Except maybe in your post. You're making it seem like the person you're responding to is in favor of doubling or tripling the tax rate or something, when in reality he probably supports a moderate increase.)<p>> That's why per capita tax receipts have stayed fairly consistent over time . . .<p>Your link shows the opposite. Per capita tax receipts have grown 250% over the last sixty years according to that chart.<p>> I don't think we can raise taxes to the point where it would get us out of this mess<p>How high do you think that is? Right now receipts are well south of 20% of GDP. Currently revenue would have to be doubled, but outlays typically increase and revenues decrease during a recession. If you look at the non-recession tax rates that would be needed to close that gap in, e.g., the Bush years, it would have only taken a 5-10% increase, which hardly seems as outrageous as you're making it out to be.",1317350008

3055317,comment,3054310,3054310,6,0,philiphodgen,,,"Let's say you successfully create a Delaware corporation.  It exists.  It has a US tax ID number.  It has a bank account.  It has a merchant account.  All of the stuff you want to do business.  In other words, stipulate complete success in achieving your business objective.<p>Here is what the tax part of your plan will look like:<p>1.  Money comes into your corporation via the merchant account.<p>2.  After paying expenses, you have money left over inside your Delaware corporation.<p>3.  That -- to the U.S. government -- is taxable income.<p>Crap.  So you have to pay U.S. tax on the money flowing through the merchant account?  You don't want to do that.  How do you get the money out of that Delaware corporation?<p>A.  Dividend.  No good.  First you pay corporate income tax on your profits in the Delaware corporation. Then you pay a dividend to the shareholder--you.  The default U.S. rule is that the Delaware corporation has to withhold 30% of the dividend payment it makes to you.  There are sometimes ways around this.<p>B.  Loan to you.  No good.  First you pay corporate income tax on your profits in the Delaware corporation.  Then you loan it to yourself.  Only marginally better because at least you don't have the 30% withholding tax on the dividend.  But you have to pay the loan back, with interest.  And the interest payment back to the Delaware corporation is taxable income to the Delaware corporation on which it has to pay income tax.<p>C.  Tax-deductible expense.  Aha.  Now we're getting somewhere.  The Delaware corporation has a business expense that it pays.  This reduces its taxable income, thus reducing tax.  E.g., $1,000 of profit in the corporation, and you perform services for the corporation and the corporation pays you a consulting fee of $950.  Hey presto!  New net profit is $1,000 - $950 = $50 profit in the Delaware corporation.  Tax liability is next to zero.  Yay.<p>Item C is where the fun and games are.  This is called transfer pricing in the tax geek world.  (Yes, in fact I do own the domain name taxgeek.com and I can't figure out what to do with it.)  In order to do this successfully you have to navigate through complex tax rules to avoid tax withholding on that $950 you paid yourself (analogous to the 30% withholding on that dividend).  You have to navigate through the transfer pricing rules generally.<p>It's awesomely hard.  And expensive.  The reason is simple:  you're trying to drain taxable profits out of a high tax country, thus depriving the U.S. government of money.  They are quick to call ""Bullshit"" on these types of plans.  So you have to do it right.  And many, many other countries have their own transfer pricing rules.<p>When you said ""Can I charge the US company the same amount it makes on (re)selling a monthly subscription?"" you were really talking about something that looks like transfer pricing.<p>Related party transactions.  Meh.  Hard.  That's what we are talking about and they get looked at by the government.  A lot.<p>Advice:  set up the Delaware corporation so it buys your product, marks it up, and resells it.  Leave a little profit on the table in the USA and pay tax on it.  As long as you are a small potato floating in the great crockpot of life, you are probably going to be OK.  :-)<p>Further advice.  You MUST prevent the USA from thinking that you (from wherever you live) are doing business directly in the USA.  This is variously called a ""permanent establishment"" (in treaty lingo) or other similar ideas.<p>Further advice.  The accounting and tax return work for this is going to chew up a lot of your profits.  If you get a cheap quotation for tax return work, run like hell.  People who are competent in international tax work are rare, therefore expensive.  And the price of incompetence is usually big financial penalties from the government -- like $10,000 at a time for not filing the correct documents.<p>That is why I tell people to concentrate on running their business correctly and not to get clever to save taxes in the international area.  Set up as simple a structure as possible to eliminate as many possibilities for error as you can.  Like they say in AA, if you don't take the first drink you don't get drunk.  If you don't set up that extra-fancy tax-saving device, you can't fuck it up and get hit with a penalty.",1317349774

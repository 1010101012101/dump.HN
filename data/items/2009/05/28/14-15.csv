630297,comment,630153,630153,0,0,imp,,,"Really cool.  Pretty easy to use overall.  I plan to play around with it a lot.  My feedback is geared towards fantasy football, but here are my thoughts and suggestions:<p>1. Some stats categories aren't clear.  Which one do I select to graph rushing yards allowed per game for a specific team?<p>2. How do I create a motion chart? I couldn't see how to do that and I didn't find any to copy from.<p>3.  I'll never want to put an image in the background of a graph.<p>4. Add a category for fantasy points.  Just use a simple default scoring system.<p>5. Can I resize the image or flash graph?  I don't like the thumbnail because you can't tell what it is, and I want to be able to embed a graph that's about half the size of the current embedable graphs, like 400 pixels wide.<p>6. Any thoughts on a simple API?  I see that the embedded graphs don't have any parameters.  They have to be saved graphs.  It would be cool to be able to embed a graph on different player pages by just changing parameters to the graph.  For example, I'd like to be able to embed a graph into this page that shows stats for Pierre Thomas last year.  <a href=""http://www.fantasyfootballchatter.com/pierre-thomas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fantasyfootballchatter.com/pierre-thomas</a>.  Bonus points if it doesn't require knowing player IDs and is just something like <a href=""http://statplot.com/graph/nfl/pierre-thomas?cat=rushing-yards"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statplot.com/graph/nfl/pierre-thomas?cat=rushing-yard...</a>.  There could be a lot of sites out there that would embed charts if it was easier and didn't require creating an account and saving each one individually.",1243522695

During WWI, it was suspended twice. In fact, gold standards are regularly and habitually suspended in times of war. (Ideally, once reinstated, a deflationary postwar period would counter the inflationary period during the war, but there is no rule saying the standard must be reinstated at the same notational value, so this is wishful thinking.)<p>During the depression, the Gold Reserve Act reset the value of gold from $20.67/oz to $35/oz, effectively devaluing the dollar against every other gold-backed currency (inflation), and, to quote wikipedia ""the higher price increased the conversion of gold into dollars, allowing the U.S. to effectively corner the world gold market"".<p>So the government can still manipulate the value of it's currency at will, simply by changing the redeemable value of it's notes.

It all seems super-slick.<p>Multitasking looks great, and it's a massive oversight in the iPhone's featureset. The fact that you can't run a MSN Messenger client or a streaming audio application in the background, for example, kind of cripples it. The fact that Apple hasn't managed to do it doesn't mean that the Pre can't, any more than the fact that Internet Explorer Mobile didn't mean that the iPhone browser was crap. The card interface in particular looks fantastically intuitive and deserves all the praise it gets. On the other hand, ""Notifications"" are simply a poor substitute from proper multitasking functionality. I think Apple will reveal proper multitasking, possibly exclusive to a next-gen iPhone, over the next year.<p>People are divided over the QWERTY people, but it's undeniable that it some people prefer physical buttons. In particular, the audience that Palm are likely aiming at, which is primarily business Blackberry users, prefer physical keyboards. I don't think trying to differentiate itself from the iPhone will do them any harm though.<p>I've not used the SDK, but I understand their approach. It's a trade-off. It's not very useful for real-time applications like games. However, web applications are becoming more and more popular, even on the desktop with applications like AIR. Whatsmore, people know HTML/CSS/JS tech (particularly compared to Objective-C), and that makes it easy for them to encourage people to develop applications on their platform, even if it remains a niche. It seems like a reasonable trade-off. I'm not convinced games are really that important either, the case in point being Mac OS X users.<p>The iPhone has a leg up over the Pre in sheer quantity of applications. On the other hand, long did Palm OS and Windows Mobile. And Windows still does over Mac OS X. It doesn't really matter as long as there's thriving communities on all unless there's one single-platform ""killer app"" which can't easily be replicated on the others, which currently doesn't, and is unlikely to, exist. All that matters is that there is a thriving developer ecosystem.<p>Hype doesn't have to equal to sales, as Blackberry and Nokia have shown by outselling the iPhone in the United States and Europe. It's also worth adding that if Palm sell half the amount of units that Apple do, they'd probably be celebrating in the streets and their share price would rocket. Palm's measure of success is almost certainly not anywhere near ""beating the iPhone"".<p>If we measure success by innovation and ""X did it first"", Opera would be the most popular browser on the planet and we'd all be running BeOS right around now. Being a ""game changer"" really doesn't matter in the long-term.<p>The price is higher. But it is a brand new phone with a brand new operating system, and they likely want to charge early adopters more. I doubt Palm are going to choose the Apple pricing strategy of keeping the price static for months or even years, and are more likely to compete in price as time goes on, especially when their exclusivity agreement ends and if they remain the underdog.<p>There's also other reasons. The fact it's on a different network to the competition works in its favour - not everyone has a choice of having good coverage for all the networks. The lack of a removable battery has likely discouraged corporate users from the iPhone. The DOC/PPT/XLS and PDF viewer will appeal to corporate users and is a nice touch. I regard avoiding iTunes as a big win. A decent camera with flash is a nice touch too.",1243520426

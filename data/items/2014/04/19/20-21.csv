Although some of us promote JS as pretty close to that, even JS has a C/C++ base under the covers.<p>It&#x27;s hard to get any new system to be seen seriously.  It took the better part of 3-4 years for NodeJS to see any traction, and even then it&#x27;s misunderstood.  I continuously see people following the same patterns in building Node modules as they would for C# libraries.<p>It looks like you&#x27;ve at least tackled what is a very hard part in many organizations, and that is infrastructure.  Not to mention, the new code can intermingle with the old (at least for a while).<p>I like FP paradigms, I find that it definitely leads to better unit test coverage...

7614694,comment,7613239,7613239,6,0,hollerith,,,"Since I have been using rc as my interactive shell since approximately 2001 and since I tend to have a PERFECTIONISTIC attitude towards the software that I use every day like the OP has, I will give a list of what I like and dislike about rc (relative to bash) in order of decreasing importance or significance. (Specifically, since about 2001, I have been using the port of rc by Byron Rakitzis on Linux and OS X.)<p>If you <i>like</i> Unix shells, then you probably want to skip this comment since it is my opinion that <i>all</i> unix shells including rc suck for interactive use.<p>The original meaning of the word &quot;shell&quot; was a interface layer between the core Unix system and the user. I now consider Emacs my shell, and I try to replace interactive use of rc, bash or other traditional Unix shells with interactive use of Emacs whenever practical.<p>E.g., to escape from the hassle described below caused by equal signs in Youtube URLs, I defined an Emacs Lisp function M-x youtube-dl so that I no longer need to use a Unix shell to interact with the command-line program youtube-dl. (This works for me because 99.9 percent of my interactions with rc are through Emacs.  Consequently, I do not need to switch from Terminal.app to Emacs.app to type M-x youtube-dl because Emacs.app already has the focus even when I am interacting with rc, and Terminal.app is not even running most of the time on my system.)<p>I tend to define new commands and wrap/redefine existing commands like ls a lot, which of course means writing some code. Consequently, the list below includes problems I encountered (in bash and in rc) in writing and maintaining code that defines new interactive commands and defines wrappers around existing interactive commands. (My .rcrc file -- which is rc&#x27;s analog to .bash_profile and .bashrc -- is currently 704 lines long and contains 112 definitions of rc functions, but about half of those 112 are &quot;of historical interest only&quot;.  I.e., maybe I should have deleted most of them by now.)<p>Here starts the list.<p>Backslash does not quote the next character in rc like it does in bash.<p>Consequently, to refer to a file name with space in it, you have to do it &#x27;like this&#x27; rather than like\\ this.<p>Unfortunately, all the softwares I am aware of that do tab completion of file names quote spaces and pound signs like\\ this, which makes it tedious in rc commandlines to type file names with spaces and pound signs in them. This has been for me the biggest disadvantage of rc relative to other shells.  It has been especially painful OS X where spaces in file names are not rare, but even on linux it was painful for me to specify file names like #long_name_here# which Emacs was in the habit of leaving around until I figured out how to get it to stop doing that.<p>Parenthetically, I ran into the same basic problem with <i>all</i> the Plan-9 and Plan-9-inspired software I tried to embrace (e.g., Wily, Acme via plan9port): namely, although the design decisions work okay for people who use only Plan 9, the mismatch between the Plan 9 way of doing things and the OS X or Linux way of doing things makes it unworthwhile to use a Plan-9-inspired tool or a tool ported from Plan 9 on OS X or Linux. E.g., on Plan 9, file-name completion via the tab key is simply unavailable, which works on Plan 9 because everyone including the providers of the basic system keeps path names nice and short.<p>In bash et al, you can have an equal sign in a file name or a URL without needing to quote it. In contrast, in rc, you need to quote it. this is a hassle for me since youtube URLs have equal signs in them, and I am in the habit of pasting them into shell commandlines a lot.<p>The thing I like most about rc relative to bash is that a function definition begins with the characters &quot;fn foo&quot; where &quot;foo&quot; is the name of the function. This makes it easier to use plain old &quot;find in page&quot; functionality to navigate to a function definition in a file full of function definitions. In other words, in bash et al, you have to type &quot;foo()&quot; to search for the start of the definition of the function foo whereas in rc you can type &quot;fn foo &quot; which is easier to type.<p>Moreover, in the process of writing this, I used grep to determine the number of function definition in my .rcrc file (rc&#x27;s analog to bash&#x27;s .bashrc file). specifically, I used &quot;grep &#x27;^fn &#x27; .rcrc&quot;. the analogous operation for bash is harder to express.<p>Since this thing I like most about rc is a relatively small thing, you would be correct in concluding that I do not believe it is worth it to switch from a normal shell like bash to rc.<p>Another thing I like about rc: unlike bash, newlines are not somehow in subtle ways significant in &quot;multi-line constructs&quot; like if statements. in other words, if statements, switch statements and for statements in rc resemble statements in normal languages like C more than if statements, etc, in bash do.<p>The quoting rules are simpler in rc than in bash. Although I found that very appealing in theory before I started using rc, in practice, I still struggled with &quot;quoting-related issues&quot; in rc. for example, the definition of the rc function I used as a wrapper around /bin/ls contained the following code whose purpose is to &quot;print&quot; (cat to stdout) its contents whenever there exists a file named .hdr in the directory being listed.<p>the code loses whenever the full path to the directory I want to list contains a space. in particular if I cd somehow to /0/library/saved application state, then invoke my wrapper command, the error message<p>test: application/.hdr: unknown operand<p>test: application/_darcs: unknown operand<p>test: application/.alpha: unknown operand<p>appear in the output, and the .hdr file is not printed. For those readers who know how to fix that bug in the code below, please do not feel you need to educate me about the fix.  To write code in rc you have to know some &quot;shell lore&quot;, and although some people might take pride in learning shell lore, I&#x27;d rather avoid the need to learn it. In most languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, Lisp), there is no special lore one has to learn to ensure that path names with spaces in them are handled correctly.<p><pre><code>    # set dirname2 to the directory portion of the last argument.\n    # make that directory name an absolute file name.\n    # make sure it ends in a slash.\n    if (!test -d $*($#*)) {\n        dirname2 = `{cd `{dirname $*($#*)}; pwd}^/\n    } else {\n        dirname = `{cd $*($#*); pwd}\n        switch($dirname) {\n        case */\n            dirname2 = $dirname\n        case *\n            dirname2 = $dirname^/\n        }\n    }\n    # if a .hdr file exists, print it now:\n    if(~ $#* 1) {\n        if(test -d $1) {\n            if(test -r $dirname2^.hdr) {\n                cat $dirname2^.hdr\n                echo\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nin summary, for me switching to rc was probably a waste of my time, and I would have been better off sticking with bash (and better off starting sooner on my slow mission to replace interactive uses of traditional Unix shells with interactive uses of Emacs).",1397941078

7614689,comment,7613526,7613526,1,0,dmourati,,,"My last two companies have offered or will shortly offer this benefit. I read the Netflix benefits deck a while ago and mention it frequently in conversations with colleagues.<p>One benefit to this policy that goes unmentioned is the decrease in friction in tracking PTO. In previous companies, I&#x27;ve had to find a PTO form, fill it out, submit to manager for signature, submit that to Payroll/HR for tracking and then finally take the time off. Payroll/HR has had to submit this number to ADP who has had to track it on my paystubbs. My manager has had to track my vacation and make sure I wasn&#x27;t taking off without filling out the forms. When I left, we had to reconcile PTO banked but not taken and pay that out.<p>With an &quot;unlimited&quot; vacation policy, all that friction, or at least most of it is gone.<p>The one part about PTO I strongly dislike is getting &quot;approval.&quot; If PTO is offered as part of your job, you shouldn&#x27;t need approval to take it. Notice, yes, sure. Letting your team know you will be out is just good professional ethics and behavior. But requiring your manager to &quot;approve&quot; has always bothered me.",1397940932

I spent a couple of hours and couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get Powershell to do that, but it took about 10 minutes to find a T-SQL command to do what I wanted, figure out how to run it from the command line using sqlcmd, and set up a Ruby script to automate it and generate the commands dynamically, etc.<p>Powershell also seems to require installing dozens of little thingys for using most of its features, all of which are very picky about bittedness, and which are mostly tucked away in weird corners of Microsoft&#x27;s sites. Ruby has one installer on an easy to find site, though I admit it took a while to discover that using anything but 32-bit 1.9.3 on Windows will only lead to pain.",1397940247

In 2007, the year before CERN first powered up the LHC, the lab produced 142 master&#x27;s and Ph.D. theses, according to the lab&#x27;s document server. Last year it produced 327. (Fermilab chipped in 54.) That abundance seems unlikely to vanish anytime soon, as last year ATLAS had 1000 grad students and CMS had 900.<p>In contrast, the INSPIRE Web site, a database for particle physics, currently lists 124 postdocs worldwide in experimental high-energy physics, the sort of work LHC grads have trained for.<p>The situation is equally difficult for postdocs trying to make the jump to a junior faculty position or a permanent job at a national lab. The Snowmass Young Physicists survey received responses from 956 early-career researchers, including 343 postdocs. But INSPIRE currently lists just 152 &quot;junior&quot; positions, including 61 in North America.

Rather than serve as a cushion of laziness for supervisors, who often have only a limited and utilitarian view when defining the opening of an IC post, the contract policy must ensure the inclusion of an element of social justice, which is cruelly absent today.<p><a href=""http://staff-association.web.cern.ch/content/unsatisfactory-contract-policy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://staff-association.web.cern.ch/content/unsatisfactory-...</a><p>The long-held but erroneous assumption of never-ending rapid growth in biomedical science has created an unsustainable hypercompetitive system that is discouraging even the most outstanding prospective students from entering our profession—and making it difficult for seasoned investigators to produce their best work.

The number of S&E PhDs awarded annually has also increased over this time frame, from ~19,000 in 1982 to ~36,000 in 2011. The number of faculty positions created each year, however, has not changed, with roughly 3,000 new positions created annually.<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n10/full/nbt.2706.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n10/full/nbt.2706.html</a><p>One is simply that graduate students represent the cheapest form of labor, and so graduate programs have expanded to keep researchers well supplied. The end result is that 8,000 people get a PhD in the biological sciences each year, far more than can ever hope to find faculty positions. Only about 20 percent of them end up staying in research positions, yet graduate education generally provides training in nothing but research.<p>The problem is that everybody who would actually implement these reforms at the institutional level won&#x27;t like them. Successful researchers will have to accept smaller and more focused labs and see their smaller pool of grad students distracted by training in areas other than research.

These ideas are created by choosing concepts which are similar (not the same in some way). The way they are not the same is by leaving out the measurements. Which measurements are left off depends upon the concept. Ex. the concept of wavelengths leaves out the measurements of the wavelengths individually.<p>Therefore the language is already very imprecise to begin with. Other new concepts are created and defined by previous concepts which will be used to define the new concept.<p>So language is conceptual by definition. The actual definitions of concepts are the referrents of the concepts. Ex. cat means all cats which have ever lived and all cats which will ever exist. This language then is a translation from existence to a mental re-presentation of existence then is a translation from existential to a mental model. This process is VERY conservative (a compression if you wish). One 3 letter concept can re-present a memory image we have all learned and can therefore convey (? Some meaning) to another person who has learned to duplicate the process. Notice however that we each live separate lives and will have unique representations in our unique memories of which cat we think the concept represents at this moment in time.<p>If you think of the memory as an operating system for each one of us, then we each have to write that operating system as we live out our lives.

Either you feel sed is on the same level as awk and rc, hence mentioning it together with them (unlike say, ls or grep or any of the other commands you didn&#x27;t mention) as being one of the tools you would use instead of general scripting languge X.  Or you meant using them together for one specific task rather than as a general &quot;sometimes you would use one, sometimes you would use the other&quot;.  In which case you don&#x27;t realize that there is no reason to ever do that since awk can already do everything sed can.<p>>I&#x27;ve not used the rc shell<p>That&#x27;s precisely what I pointed out was a problem.  &quot;I have no knowledge of one of the things I am comparing&quot; is not a rebuttal to &quot;you have no knowledge of one of the things you are comparing&quot;.<p>>My comments apply to all of those<p>And all of those are listed in the same category.

Hence my suggestion that you try it and find out how you feel about it, rather than just assuming it is the same as bash.<p>>Also: plan 9 is Unix-like<p>No it is not.  Linux is &quot;unix-like&quot;.  Plan 9 is a completely different OS, designed as a spiritual successor to unix, which was seen as having been corrupted.  It is no more unix-like than windows is dos-like.<p>>So yes, it&#x27;s a new(ish) thing with a naming conflict with something already well-known.<p>I never said otherwise.  You asked &quot;who names something new on Unix &#x27;rc&#x27;?&quot;.  I pointed out the obvious fact that it simply isn&#x27;t the case.  It is not something new on unix.

It&#x27;s a domain specific visual programming language designed for working with tabular data. So people who want to build a custom query on a database can do it just by dragging and dropping the right &quot;tool&quot; onto the &quot;worksheet&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a desktop app rather than web, although it is actually built using HTML, canvas and JavaScript.<p>It can do <i>almost</i> anything SQL can. It can&#x27;t do &quot;IN&quot; queries yet but I have a plan do that in a way that&#x27;s consistent with the general drag and drop approach of the app. It doesn&#x27;t explicitly handle BETWEEN queries but they are easily achieved by using two filter tools one after the other.<p>I think there are two types of complexity to be dealt with when enabling users to build reports/queries. One is the complexity of the concepts involved, the other is the complexity of communicating what you want to happen to the computer. I built QueryTree because of a belief that many people understood they the concept of a filter or a join, but just didn&#x27;t like text based programming languages. I replaced the SQL syntax but left everything else in place. If I didn&#x27;t think my target users were up to understanding the conceptual complexity I would have restricted it a bit more and would probably have ended up with something like IFTTT.com but for data. Mostly, people seem to &quot;get&quot; QueryTree though, especially when they&#x27;re using it on data that they&#x27;re familiar with.",1397937716

I think most people will be more productive for a company working reasonable hours for at most 50 weeks a year than working all 52 (minus holidays in both cases).<p>Accordingly, I think it is appropriate for a company to pay you to not work some of the time. I think that fits with your suggestion pretty well: give an employee 4 weeks PTO (or whatever you think will optimize their productivity and happiness), with the option to take more UTO that might not be an upside for the company.<p>edit: There should probably still be some reasonable cap on the additional UTO. Not pay their salary during vacation still doesn&#x27;t account for fixed costs like health insurance and office space.

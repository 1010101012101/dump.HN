2569576,comment,2568942,2569545,2,0,Meai,,,"Oh yes, short term it's a little more work. You probably have to write a few tutorials, tidy the codebase up a little more than usual...but in the end, you open source because you want people to do work for you for free.<p>> If you do it simply because you think it's going to save you some work, it won't pay off.<p>A very immature blanket statement. Sometimes it will pay off, sometimes not. Depends on everything success usually depends on - open source is not some kind of magical exception. If you have a good product, but you feel like you won't be able to support it forever on your own or you don't expect or want to earn money from it anyway, you will open source it. In the end, it always boils down to wanting help with the workload though. If you had infinite time, you would just write everything yourself. I know I would, it's a lot more satisfying and interesting. But since we are all mere mortals with generally empty bellies, we open source secondary pillars of our livelihood. Nothing wrong with it, that's how it is.",1305928756

Meanwhile, the Mac market share keeps growing, year after year, with only minor increases in the prevalence of malware, and no major botnets or worms of the sort that were rampant on Win9x and early XP.<p>Claiming that OS X is (or will be) a soft target also serves to further undermine the market share argument: Windows has been getting more secure over time, which should help make OS X a more attractive target if it really is a softer target than Windows.",1305928440

2569559,comment,2568453,2568491,5,0,pstack,,,"I would slightly disagree. I'm a new contributor, here, but I simply look at the comments on my profile and see the scores which helps me determine when I have, perhaps, strayed. It helps me refine what I contribute and how, based on the community response. Of course, I then have to interpret what scores are the result of my contributing something of value versus people simply agreeing with the <i>sentiment</i> of my comment, but that isn't too hard. I don't know that enough people would see public scores and derive what is good or bad <i>before</i> contributing to be a reason for tagging every post with them.<p>I think the way the system is, now, isn't ideal but it is decent. It eliminates the temptation of a lot of people to post with the intention of getting lots of points so everyone sees how awesome they or their comment are, but still provides the input on those comments for the <i>individual</i> to see. So it helps shape your quality, without making the ""ranking"" a public competition.<p>As for curating the live contents of an actual discussion . . . I don't think exact point numbers is necessary for that. If I only want to read the best top half of the comments in a discussion, I don't need to know that a set of comments got 12, 32, 48, and 119 points. I just need them to be displayed in such a way that I can discern the top-most content. Physically weight the comments (in color, boldness, placement, or other possible options) so that the top 20% of comments appear in one way, the next 40% appear another, and the bottom 20-40% appear in yet another way. Easy to visually discern and pick through, but the top comments are then tied to the top comments in relation to that exact discussion and not a hardset number of ""anything over 50 points is really great - period"". (For all I know, this may be how HN does it - I tend to read most comments already, so I'm not sure).",1305928287

Personally, I would rather see that from a simple, discreet number than a million ""me, too"" posts. The latter is the most obvious negative change I have observed since the scores disappeared, though as it happens I do agree with many of the other points people have made in this discussion as well.<p>If you're worried about too much groupthink and people trying to score every last point they can for some reason, surely there are other approaches that could be implemented quite simply: you could use some sort of grouping with a logarithmic scale, for example, or cap the maximum points any post can receive and let it decay accordingly in the priorities relative to newer posts no matter how many upvotes it got at the start of the discussion.",1305927903

I understand prices are higher because circulation is typically much lower.<p>However, that leads me to another question: Must we always look at analogies from the past and work with them? The beauty of new technologies is that they're <i>better</i> than the old ones we had. It might take a lot more work, but it is much better to look at things afresh rather than falling back on old structures and status quo. The reason IP is so contentious is precisely because of this. We <i>do not</i> have anything to fall back on and must device probably completely new and arbitrary rules. Clearly it is in the publishers best interest to stick to status quo as much as possible and try to find analogies to old models so that it might be easier to justify a system in place that guarantees a revenue stream.

However, all of the resources listed seem to solve different problems than bitcoin. Several of them enable the user to create their own currency rather than provide a single new one. None of the systems/protocols/programs listed have all of the following features that bitcoin has:<p>1) Decentralized and solves the double-spending problem without a central server<p>2) Automatic and controlled production of new coins<p>3) The rules are governed by the software running on a majority of the computing power, and thus the rules can change if the majority of the software changes<p>So bitcoin is unique, but there these other tools may be complementary to bitcoin.",1305925906

I'm not fully convinced, however, that this difficulty has actually changed consumer notions of what is, and is not, ethically sharable. I haven't seen enough data on consumer perceptions or beliefs; all the data presented so far can just as easily be explained by the difficulty of sharing in and of itself. (Note that I'm not saying perception changes <i>won't</i> ever happen; I'm merely saying that I don't know if they've actually happened just yet).<p>For the record, I am pro-sharing, and I believe that IP holders and media companies who would do their darndest to prevent sharing are incredibly short-sighted. They wring their hands about the need for (evidently magical) ""viral marketing"" of their material, while at the same time inherently limiting the ability of their consumers to do a lot of the peer-to-peer marketing that they used to do.",1305925734

The focus of the community is a niche market with very little competition but we fare well by providing good value to our community.<p>Our revenue sources breaks down as follows:<p>* 40/50K/month in subscription revenue<p>* 25K/month in adsense revenue<p>* 4k/month in other ad revenue (Ebay, Amazon, Viglink etc)<p>* 30K/month in license and royalty revenue<p>As the sole employee, my primary responsibilities are all of the development of the platform, all system administration, all marketing and business activities, financials, and I also provide all the primary user support for the site.  We have approximately 120 administrators and moderators who are volunteers, and we also have 4 individuals who are independent contractors who receive a set amount every month to lead different parts of our site and lead those volunteers.<p>Our platform is primarily based on Amazon Web services but includes physical servers from other hosting platforms.  Platform as a service providers that we use include Cloudkick, Chartbeat, Geckoboard, Dynect, and SendGrid.<p>The reason why we have been so successful is we cater to a hobbyist market and operate on a very generous freemium model.  Our subscription revenue is solid and predictable, and we experience very few chargebacks because we have consciously decided not to do automated renewals.  Our license and royalty revenue is due to licensing agreements we have with third parties who utilize our content and services and APIs, as well as mobile device makers who serve our content (primarily to the Android and iOS market).<p>All of the above is a full time job and I rarely ever have a day off, although I have a tremendous amount of flexibility with my schedule.",1305925610

We don't license our technology or outsource our support staff to other banks. Banks are our partners, not our customers, and we only partner with a small number of banks who share our values and are willing to set aside things like fee revenue to work with us. We have a symbiotic relationship with those banking partners: we bring them deposits, and they make loans on those deposits and share the resulting interest margin with us. That is one of several sources of revenue for us, but not our sole source of revenue.<p>2. If customers like the way we help manage their money, we're able to connect them to a variety of financial products that are mutually beneficial to our customers, our banking partners, and to us. As above, our banking partners are happy because we're bringing them new customers for various financial products, many of which have a decent margin on them (CDs, for example). We share that margin with our partners, and that's another source of revenue.<p>Our business is all about aligning the interests of the banking industry with the interests of our customers.

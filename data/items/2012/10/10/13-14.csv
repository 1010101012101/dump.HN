At GDC 2009, when OnLive revealed itself to the world in style, a rival named Gaikai did the same behind closed doors, and when Gaikai CEO David Perry came by the OnLive booth to greet his competitor, Perlman starting screaming at him. On June 17th, 2010, the day OnLive launched, Gaikai announced a multi-year deal with Electronic Arts. Perlman received the news in the OnLive booth at E3 2010.

In the future I want to create this as an online service, but I'm in the validation stages right now and making it a service is a much bigger project.<p>Here are some benefits and my goals with this product:<p> Make pitch decks the new standard for pitching instead of powerpoint.<p> A pitch deck on your own URL makes it easy to share versus sending a bulky   attachment<p> Pitch deck makes you stand out: its interactive and tells a story which keeps the user engaged<p>Some questions:<p> Is the price too high? (Its a $1000 value)<p> Is this something you would find useful?

Knowing, then, that any company approaching an IPO is trying to get as much money as possible from its initial investors, why would anyone want to be one?

When you hear of engineers being compared to MacGyver they are speaking of this very rare skill.  Greats will figure out a way based on minimal resources and will be aware of alternatives to their first choice of tool.""<p>I see the opposite as a problem - not being aware of standard solutions for tools, and reinventing the wheel yet again without even bothering to go look for something that might exist already.  Praising this 'macgyver' skill reinforces in people's minds that it's perfectly fine (perhaps desirable) to ""roll your own"" all the time.  The extra couple hours or days you spend up front understanding tools that tens of thousands of other people already know will pay off down the line when you hit configuration, scaling, performance, security or other problems vs your home grown 'solution'.<p>This has continually been something I've run in to the past few years, and it reminds me of my own 'roll your own' justifications from 10-15 years ago.  The only defenses I have are back then there was <i>far</i> less available open source tools (or even closed source) for many of the problem domains I hit back in the mid 90s.  Today that's far less of an issue in most situations, and I'm far more sensitive to the maintenance burden imposed by a 'roll your own' mindset (because I've had to maintain my own code from 10 years ago!).<p>It's one thing if the primary options are off the table due to budgetary issues (hit me recently as well), but in most cases I find it's people not being aware (and not researching) to see if industry standard options exist.",1349877033

I used to be a mechanic, and have modified my share of Porsche 911s. Have a couple that put out above 600 horsepower when measured at the wheels. Almost doubling their factory output. Designed turbocharger systems, intake manifolds (which was difficult due to me not previously knowing much about fluid dynamics , and such), intercoolers, stand alone fuel injection systems, and aerodynamics with composite materials (mostly fiberglass and carbon fiber). If you ask me right now about any of the subjects I would draw a blank. Why? Because I learned how to do something back then for a couple of projects, and then moved on. I did not need to know fluid dynamics for my day job fixing cars. Neither did I need to know much math. Just needed to know how to do the basics that the work required. Which were mostly things learned in the field.<p>Same with programming. I started out writing programs that solved a problem. Then continued with such an approach until hitting a wall due to lack of mathmatical knowledge. Learned whatever needed and moved on. Do I remmeber most of the math I've had to learn? Not really. I don't use it everyday. If I have to use it again, I'll just go to my reference material and refresh my memory.<p><i>Well, if all you are doing is writing CRUD apps, I don't see how someone like OP is going to be even remotely a good fit.

First of all, they have some independency in that you can introduce branches over a subset of them, so they're not just SIMD vector units. Secondly, their threaded programming model is pretty well suited for many computational tasks. Executing the same operations over a whole 2D or 3D region of data is a pretty common thing in computing. If you can't parallelize your task that way, chances are it's not even parallelizeable on N x86 cores. If you compare this to x86 however, you'd have to count n Cores times the SSE vector length on each core to be fair. GPUs still come out ahead for most of heavy computational tasks though - which is why Intel is now fighting back with their Xeon Phi stuff (which sounds very promising btw., looking forward to play with our prerelease model that's coming soon ;) ).",1349874390

Everybody's time is valued here and on a individual basis.\n3. I'm glad i had influence on whom i will be working with on a daily basis and have not regretted it either. My workmates are awesome. Why should the management decide this all alone?<p>Everybody here is free to openly make reservations about the companies strategies and decisions.",1349874290

4636099,comment,4635623,4635965,2,0,alexkus,,,"The usual suspects are recursive qsort() implementations inside libc on Solaris, HP-UX and AIX. They've got a lot better in the latest releases but our software is supported on the older platforms (as far back as Solaris 7 for example) so it has to be made to work on them. glibc has done it properly for years. So this is mainly software written in C/C++.<p>Other languages do sorting in one of several ways:-<p>1) Just wrapper libc's qsort() and so suffer the same problem if that's susceptible.<p>2) Implement the naive recursive stack-gobbling quicksort in their own language as a module/package/import/library.<p>3) Implement their own sorting algorithm that avoids lots of recursive calls or does the tricks to pick suitable pivots, etc.<p>It's #1 and #2 that tend to suffer from problems when sorting large datasets, or the pathalogical cases that pinpoint the absolute worst in the design of the algorithm.",1349874052

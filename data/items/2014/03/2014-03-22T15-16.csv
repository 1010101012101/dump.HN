7449527,comment,7445685,7446313,1,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"> You should also look at it from the other side: if I have a job that I work at 8-10 hours a day (and might not do if I didn&#x27;t need the money), how am I &quot;punishing&quot; the other guy by not sharing the fruits of my labor with him for nothing in return?<p>The question itself is incorrect.  Low-paid workers or the unemployed are not parasites on highly-paid <i>workers</i>; the capitalist class is a parasite on <i>all</i> workers, no matter the salary, and through their control over government they continually engineer a level of unemployment that can suppress wages.<p>(If you don&#x27;t believe me about the government, look up how inflation targeting works.  Central banks are supposed to target both low unemployment and low inflation, but for the past several decades, the <i>deliberate policy choice</i> has been to consistently sacrifice wage growth (ie: exploit workers harder) in order to maintain both low inflation and economic growth at the same time.)",1395503917

If somebody can prove they&#x27;re a citizen, they get the BI, no need to determine their income.<p>As for a $4k tax being &quot;crippling to a good chunk of them&quot; -- no, you misunderstand the nature of BI. If we&#x27;re paying $20k worth of BI in this scenario, then the mean income should be about $40k (since a good level for BI -- in basically any economy -- is about 50% of the mean). We could then support a flat $20k/person BI with a flat 50% earned-income tax. This means that the payments and receipts, per person would look like this:<p><pre><code>  Income    Tax   +BI    Net    Effective tax rate\n  $0       -$0    $20k   $20k   N/A\n  $10k     -$5k   $20k   $15k   N/A\n  $20k     -$10k  $20k   $10k   N/A\n  $30k     -$15k  $20k   $5k    N/A\n  $40k     -$20k  $20k   $0     N/A\n  $50k     -$25k  $20k  -$5k    10%\n  $60k     -$30k  $20k  -$10k   15%\n  ...\n  $100k    -$50k  $20k  -$30k   30%\n  ...\n  $1,000k  -$500k $20k  -$490k  49%\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see, people making the mean income or less would make nothing at all.

(coincidentally, we also need role models who are both vocal AND able to organize women.) alas, in our early stages we seem to spend a lot of time arguing. so: less bicker, more build. whether your own projects or community, every hour matters.<p>3. on YC-ness: how many female founders have worked very closely alongside a VC-funded YC-alum (who happens to be a white male)? i am a minority female founder who has experienced this, and was astounded. <i>temporarily laying aside the argument of how to actually get in if you do fit that stereotype</i>: the intrinsically, deeply supportive nature of this network is such that many of you, if exposed to it, would be tempted to apply. many of you <i>would</i> apply. it wasn&#x27;t the contacts, or the advice, or the credibility it conferred (those things helped with everything from recruiting to raising $, of course—not to mention the comparative ease of getting meetings): what impressed me was this battle-hardened community offering the gift of time and emotional support to one another...generosity on a scale one rarely sees in any business context (qualities which i believe will only improve in the years to come, particularly as YC evolves to include more women). my conclusion? apply to YC. and i would suggest, if a group of mostly-white male geeks does not interest you, and i understand if that is the case, then apply to a female-oriented accelerator or better yet: assemble a group of kickass female founders, mentors and investors and start your own. (remember, the genesis of a good product is building something you need.)<p>4. food for thought: if there were a female version of YC, would you apply? would i? i am not sure i would. i do not live in a vacuum; the world i seek to conquer is a male-dominated world (at present); and part of self-mastery includes mastering one&#x27;s environment, not creating a bubble within it. but it is an interesting thought-experiment and useful to ponder.<p>*btw, not making this about white vs non-white. that alone would be the subject of a 1k post thread.",1395503409

So you take your old ActionScript code and port it over to Haxe (very similar language, but with additional features). Then you also take your Flash-vector-art SWF files, and you load it with the Haxe SWF library. OpenFL ensures you can still make all the same method calls to the Flash API, etc.<p>When you compile, you select one of many targets, kinda like unity: C++, JavaScript, etc. It conveniently packages those targets up into special configurations like &quot;Android&quot;, &quot;Windows&quot;, &quot;HTML5&quot;, &quot;Linux&quot;, etc.<p>So you can take your existing flash code and art, but get it running NATIVELY, in say, Linux desktop, with no need for the flash plugin or AIR runtime -- it&#x27;s just a C++ app that does the same stuff (and much faster!)<p>You can also output to HTML5 so your players don&#x27;t need the flash plugin anymore (the HTML5 target is still fairly new).\nAs an end user, there&#x27;s nothing for you to really do, except to wait for flash developers to switch over to it. From your perspective, all you&#x27;ll really see is that instead of Flash apps on the web, there&#x27;s more HTML5 apps. And instead of AIR apps for games on the desktop, they&#x27;re natively compiled for Linux. What happened in these cases is that the developers were using Flash before but switched to OpenFL.&quot;",1395503204

I had been using FreshBooks for keeping track of client work, but I also use it to keep track of the open source projects I work on.

They can be surprisingly convincing, because they often use huge databases of real human responses to construct their own -- if you haven&#x27;t already, I&#x27;d recommend giving Cleverbot a try[2].<p>However these chatbots often fail when an important continuity of facts is being discussed in context, where their parrot-like nature is exposed. Therefore I think this &quot;TED XPRIZE&quot; will be much easier to fool in this sense, because there&#x27;s only two questions from the judges. This essentially removes the most difficult AI challenges of a traditional turing test.<p>Of course, succeeding at the &quot;TED XPRIZE&quot; would without a doubt require legitimate and significant advancements to the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Synthesizing a convincing talk/essay with an engaging narrative and central theme is no easy task (though limited successes already exist [3]).<p>But even now computers can beat humans in very specialized areas (and specialization is a key requirement to this). For example, we already have human level-facial recognition[4] and superhuman character recognition[5]. Similarly, while it would indeed be a legitimate AI advancement to be able to construct such a speech, I do not believe this would be any more a holy grail of AGI than character recognition and facial recognition.

Easiest is to make sure there&#x27;s exactly one 2 on the board, then spawn 4s in the corners, always picking the corner farthest away from the other tiles. From time to time spawn a 2 if you can guarantee it won&#x27;t align with the other 2 in a couple of moves. Near the endgame it is trivial to have three 2 tiles which you keep always separate with careful placement of 4s. At that point the game becomes literally impossible to win.<p>Edit: Try to play it the other way, too. Try dropping tiles in the best most convenient pattern for the AI. Notice the amount of clutter that inevitably results when reaching higher numbers.

We are lucky that pg is reasonable and cares about feedback. Remember what happened with the facebok newsfeed? Also, democracies don&#x27;t mitigate all the problems of centralization. Facebook even attempted to have a vote on the new privacy features, heavily promoted it, but had a ridiculously low turnout. Most people don&#x27;t spend their time on sites trying to govern them, but simply use the tool.<p>Compare this to decentralized systems like git or the web. Any particular publisher&#x27;s decision is mitigated by the fact that the audience is small. Even if this while site disappeared tomorrow, the web would continue to exist. Can such a principle be implemented for communities in general?<p>Yes. But it requires open source software to be installed and published by many people, and clients could interact with publicly signed versions of servers (or their plugins). The key question here is who is trying to protect whom and why.<p>When a small group forms (such as the discussion thread) the participants are the most interested party, and if the host changes something from what they expected they should be able to fork the discussion and easily continue it somewhere else.<p>On the other hand, a publisher who is interested in trying out a new (version of a) plugin can install it and see people&#x27;s reactions. If they like it, they may start more discussions hosted by this publisher.<p>But the key to a &quot;free market&quot; in improvements is the switching cost.

Which SQL databases were never designed for.</i><p>What? There is no limit how much data you can stuff into a relational database and it mostly works really good. There are definitely some scenarios where relational databases are not optimal, for example aggregating huge datasets, but there are often solutions like materialized views or aggregates. The statement that RDBMSs are not designed to handle huge datasets is plain wrong.<p><i>With these growing needs the it was getting even more difficult to define a fixed structure to the data and the need to have a solution which handles unstructured data grew even more.</i><p>I don&#x27;t understand how once inability to come up with a good data model is related. If you have no data model you will have a hard time working with your data anyway. You can stuff unstructured data into a string column and modern RDBMSs also support semistructured data like XML and JSON including operations to manipulate such data. And even with XML and JSON you still have a data model, just not a relational one.<p>I agree that the relational model is somewhat stiff and it is - somewhere between sometimes and often - a pain to design, implement or evolve a schema. But a fair amount of the complexity usually comes from the domain you are modeling and does not go away when you switch to a different data model - your database may not complain when you stuff documents with seven different schemas into it, but now the burden is on the code to deal with documents with seven different formats. Data modeling and model evolution is a difficult problem and does not go away by switching technologies. The major difference is the point in time when you recognize that you have a problem.<p><i>So most of the NoSql databases traded consistency for Availability and Partition Tolerance which was a fundamental shift from the relational world where in you had to design your schema perfectly so that there were no inconsistencies in the data ( 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF).</i><p>Consistency in the sense of the CAP theorem and in the sense of database schema normalization are almost completely unrelated. This gives me the impression that the author does not really know what he is talking about.<p><i>One of the biggest advantages claimed by NoSql databases is Horizontal scalability , which is the ability to handle more load by adding in more machines, since the computing power these days has gone cheap compared to the effort required in to fine tune the app and add more computation power and memory to an existing machine.</i><p>RDBMSs support partitioning across server as well. It is probably harder to set up and does not scale as well because the provided guarantees are stronger, but it is possible.<p><i>MongoDB uses reader-writer locking mechanism , it gives concurrent access to reads but exclusive rights for write operations which means it can handle concurrent read operations but if there is aright operation it will block the reads until it gets completed .</i><p>So do many RDBMSs. Or they use MVCC and allow even more parallelism.<p><i>Prior to mongodb version 2.2 mongodb had an instance level lock which means that whenever there was a write operation it used to lock the entire mongodb instance and even if there was a read queued for a different database it will have to wait as the write operation blocked the entire mongod instance.<p>This was changed in 2.2 where in the write operation locked the whole database instead of the complete instance. So the solution which was left to scale the write operations was to add in more shards and route the next write query to a separate mongodb shard instance.</i><p>This is still extremely inferior to modern RDBMSs which usually support row level looking.<p><i>For applications this is by far the most important point to take into consideration when choosing which database to use, as for write intensive application this might come in their way to scale.</i><p>RDBMSs allow you to opt out of consistency - if you want to read uncommited data, you are usually free to do so. I don&#x27;t see why a RDBMSs should intrinsically allow less parallelism but admittedly dropping consistency guarantees is quite contrary to the reasons you usually choose a RDBMSs to begin with.<p>UPDATE: I probably misinterpreter the last part about locking and scalability - after reading it again, it sounds like the author actually warns that using MongoDB may cause scalability issues. I leave my comments as they are although they sound a bit strange in that light.<p>TO-THE-DOWN-VOTERS: I would love to hear where I am wrong, my opinion is neither set in stone nor absolute truth.",1395501549

Sure, you can compile to multiple targets, but don&#x27;t expect it to work. And if it does work, chances are your code is littered with platform-specific macros and reams of platform-specific code.<p>To make it worse, many parts of the Flash API weren&#x27;t implemented, had different semantics, didn&#x27;t work on some platforms, or worked differently on some platforms.<p>I like the idea of OpenFL and I like the Haxe programming language.

7449282,comment,7447510,7447510,87,0,RogerL,,,"I am currently spending my life working on signal processing - constructing a story of what is happening in the world from sensor data. And you know what - noise is good. You would perhaps think that the thing to do is to turn on the filters, crank &#x27;em up, and don&#x27;t ever let a noisy bit of data through.<p>But, of course, that does not work. Noise is helpful. It&#x27;s still signal. I can construct more information from a noisy signal than an overly filtered one.<p>Back to forums, I was a participant in several for a different niche area. One was obsessed with post &#x27;quality&#x27; - a horde of moderators swarming around, then after awhile they&#x27;d comb through every thread, deleting every comment they found not worthy so they would have some kind of pristine archive, and so on.<p>They utterly failed. Oh, they are still trundling along. But the sites with the industry leaders posting? Those are the ones with far less concern with &#x27;quality&#x27;. Why would an expert spend time crafting an answer to somebody when it is likely or possible that it will either not get approved to show up, or later deleted? It made no sense to them, they vocally complained, were again and again told this was for the greater good, and so they all left. Now, if you want to talk to an expert, you go to one of the other forums; if you want to talk to a complete amateur, but with never a post off topic, well, you go to the controlled one. You&#x27;ll get terrible advice, or no advice at all, but hey, it&#x27;s civil and on topic.<p>I&#x27;ve concluded nothing about HN yet, but I don&#x27;t forsee myself clicking away, endorsing post after post. This is mostly a &#x27;consume&#x27; site for me, and occasionally, post. I don&#x27;t want to spend my time endorsing and clicking away. I&#x27;ll upvote once in a while, and almost never downvote. I can&#x27;t see that changing much. I can&#x27;t see posting anymore; I am giving you value (or trying to), and you hold it hostage. Ya, okay, if that is how you feel, I&#x27;ll go elsewhere. I recognize that sounds petulant, but back to the site in the first paragraph - a lot of people stopped posting because so much did not survive the great purges that went on. Why go to this effort if others will silence you?<p>Noise is not the enemy of quality. It is not the enemy of value. It&#x27;s a wonderful side effect of free thinking, innovative thinking, of creation, of invention. It&#x27;s messy, it&#x27;s beautiful. I love noise for what it represents.

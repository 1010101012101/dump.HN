The Python devs are at least consistent about having their own way of doing things.",1399615188

Busy watching online lectures, busy doing household maintenance, busy thinking about whether an idea I&#x27;ve had is reasonable or not. Something non-trivial always on my mind.<p>This busy-ness sort of strikes me for two reasons: 1) contrast from the roommates I have and 2) being extrovert at heart, these things simply take time away from socializing and paying more attention to the people I&#x27;m close to. I try to find a good balance between &quot;Tonight I think I&#x27;m gonna chip away some more on Baysian networks&quot; vs. &quot;Tonight I think I&#x27;ll sit back and watch a movie with the roomies&quot;, but I feel like it&#x27;s always a losing battle --- I&#x27;m not on par with the level of attention either thing would ideally have.

Where do you draw the line?  I appreciate the obvious pros of &quot;it&#x27;s just wood&quot;, but at the same time, how do I decide when it&#x27;s right to just say &quot;I&#x27;ll just pass on spending time trying to understand this, I want to put some more time in appreciating those around me.&quot;",1399614201

The different teams cause everybody to no longer give a damn, because if something is broken, you are guaranteed to never be able to fix it - you&#x27;d need to call in lots of meetings first. So we all build up little fortresses that call the other module&#x27;s services.<p>I&#x27;d differentiate projects as: those where people in charge care about the underlying build quality (call it technical debt, but that&#x27;s not nearly all of it), and those where people in charge don&#x27;t give a damn for anything except their current deadline/objectives (doesn&#x27;t matter if anything of value makes it into the current build).",1399611995

This includes the side of the wafer a chip is on or how far the chip was from the center of the wafer. As a result, processor manufacturers test their ICs and sell them based on how each one performs",1399611669

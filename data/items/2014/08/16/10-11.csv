8185868,comment,8185461,8185461,7,0,codeflo,,,"As someone who switches browsers about every six months, I feel that Firefox is still quite a bit behind in terms of stability and performance. I mostly blame the single-process model, which makes crashes and hangups way more global than they should be in 2014.<p>On Windows, there&#x27;s also the 32-bit issue. On machines with 8+ GB of RAM, having all tabs share a 2 GB address space just doesn&#x27;t cut it. Especially when your addon model, one of the key features that sets Firefox apart from other browsers, eats an additional 4 MB of this limited space per tab (and that&#x27;s just for one addon).[1]<p>Having said all that, I know that brilliant people are working on fixing this, and there have been huge improvements in the past year. And that&#x27;s how I hope they&#x27;ll win back users: by building a better browser, not just by appealing to open-source ideals and fear.<p>[1] <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2014/05/14/adblock-pluss-effect-on-firefoxs-memory-usage/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2014/05/14/adblock-plus...</a>",1408186600

Most inhouse game engines have a lot of dependencies on closed-source code, mostly 3rd party specialized engines for AI, path-finding, physics, loaders for asset management code, or code that talks to the game console SDKs. Even releasing code which only calls into those closed source libs might be illegal. And even if that would be possible you would need (commercial) licenses for each of those 3rd party libs if you want to compile the engine code yourself. Also, by releasing the code you&#x27;re inviting patent trolls to harvest your code for patent violations. Hardening a big inhouse engine for an open source release is easily just as much work as creating the thing in the first place.<p>[edit: typos]",1408185893

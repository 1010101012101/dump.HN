You tell me you&#x27;re in 10/10 pain (the &quot;worst of your life&quot;/&quot;worst you could imagine&quot;) and you&#x27;re in no visible distress with normal vital signs, then I&#x27;ll factor that into the decision.<p>That being said, I believe it is unethical, immoral to withhold something that could benefit a patient who is in genuine distress, regardless of anything else. For those patients, we have options, too. Fentanyl, for one, is used a lot pre-hospital as it is both an effective analgesic with a short lifetime in the body.<p>There used to be (probably still is) doctors in the ED who don&#x27;t want a patient to come in with pain meds onboard because they want to see a &quot;baseline presentation&quot;. Again, I think this falls into the realm of poor provider care. We have diagnostic tools for objective analysis, and having a patient in pain just so we can measure it is inhumane.<p>Bottom line: if a patient requires pain medication, they will get it from me, subject to analysis of circumstances. In your example above, if it&#x27;s not &quot;drug seeking&quot; but concerns about side effects, then the patient and I can have a discussion about benefits versus risks (the flip side to that being if a patient has a broken femur, for example, that conversation is likely to be limited to &#x27;give me the damn drug!&quot;).",1447966732

Some of the idea was based on this Joyent blog [0] post about signing the date header, but more robust and meant for a user rather than scripted access.  The idea was that the browser would interface with a specific ssh-agent with specific keys loaded for specific sites.<p>Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get very far and stopped working on it a while ago, but one thing I did learn was that the source code for links was much easier to come up to speed on and use for rough experiments than the source code for a full-on graphical browser.<p>I still have notes for it... somewhere.<p>[0] <a href=""http://joyeur.com/2012/01/03/a-bit-more-about-the-new-joyent-cloud-api/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joyeur.com/2012/01/03/a-bit-more-about-the-new-joyent...</a>",1447966725

Your utility one just doing the unskilled parts of your job would let you keep a job long enough to learn the hard skills to really be useful within a few months to a year. Automation of all these menial tasks has gotten so good that you no longer have low hanging fruit to justify employment that the level of skill a recent college grad has coming out of school.<p>Take some of the skills cited like statistics. Most people in the workforce have atrocious practical stats skills, but enough to get by. For recent grads, it&#x27;s abysmal to non-existent. A few years ago to back in the day, you wouldn&#x27;t have been expected to apply such skills on day one. You&#x27;d have enough time to realize your skill gap and address it. Not anymore.<p>Anyone thinking about university is best served by choosing schools like University of Waterloo, where there is a strong culture of having kids do real work during the summer months at real companies (instead of summer school).

The first rule of sales is to pitch the decision maker.<p>&quot;Surveys conducted by FDA and private organizations consistently show that DTC advertisements have an impact on whether consumers request and receive a specific brand-name prescription from their physician. [...] In several of these surveys, consumers were asked whether they had seen an advertisement for a prescription drug and whether seeing the advertisement resulted in discussing the medication with their doctor and receiving the prescription. Most consumers (65 to 85 percent) remembered seeing a DTC advertisement. A subset of consumers who saw an advertisement discussed the medication with their doctor. The percentage of patients asking their physicians about a prescription for a specific drug was consistent across studies, about 30 to 35 percent of those who remembered seeing a DTC advertisement. One study estimated that the 32 percent of consumers in a 2001 survey who had discussed a DTC advertisement with their doctor translated into approximately 61.1 million consumers asking about specific medications. In the consumer surveys we examined, the percentage of consumers who, in response to a DTC advertisement, requested and received a prescription from their physician for a drug they were not currently taking was generally about 5 percent (ranging from 2 percent to 10 percent). By our estimate, this means that about 8.5 million consumers received a prescription after viewing a DTC advertisement and asking their physician for the drug in 2000.&quot;<p>source: <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03177.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03177.pdf</a><p>The data doesn&#x27;t care whether or not you see the logic behind it.",1447965633

I&#x27;m just another programmer, you know?<p>The systems <i>I</i> get to design are things like: my career, my marriage, how I raise my kids.<p>And the sensible adaptations of <i>my</i> systems to unbounded immigration are: improve my lot, possibly at the expense of society&#x27;s (making a bigger pie doesn&#x27;t make sense if that simply attracts more pie eaters), prize relative status over absolute wealth (for the same reason), carry a gun, decrease my investment in society and retain options for moving abroad (same reason), and work hard to afford expensive real estate near &quot;good schools&quot; to send my children to elite colleges---<i>elite</i> you understand, not <i>good enough</i>, because with enough people, good enough, isn&#x27;t.<p>And this is all antisocial behavior, and I don&#x27;t really like it, and perhaps I will find a way to refrain from most of it and die in my bed in Oakland after ten years of philanthropy, surrounded by not only my multilingual grandchildren who, by dint of the virtues of hard work, collaboration, and generosity that I&#x27;ve taught, have managed to find their places in society, but also the neighborhood youths that I&#x27;ve mentored, <i>Gran Torino</i> style.

What Steve feels is his due is <i>loyalty</i>, which means: discrimination.  If loyalty to a company means that you stay there when you perhaps get a better offer from another, loyalty to a citizenry means that you favor its interests over some other body of people.  And I do not get the sense that proponents of mass immigration favor the interests of the citizenry over migrants.  <i>I</i> am happily ensconced at my well-paying tech job, so I will be OK---but what about Steve?  What does he tell his kids when a Mexican (by pure chance---it could have been white, but this time, it wasn&#x27;t) kid bullies them at school?  Does he feel a moral obligation to consider the other child&#x27;s interests?  Is he likely to have a calm chat with the other child&#x27;s parents?<p>What I am saying is:  &quot;You need to design your systems to deal with it&quot; is equivalent to saying, &quot;Fuck you,&quot; and while the moral and civilized response to &quot;Fuck you&quot; is &quot;Have a nice day, sir,&quot; there are many who will not be able to afford that answer.

It seems that, from a detached perspective, the only identifiable basis for our moral sense is that it enables human beings to negotiate conflict and cooperate in social settings without recourse to violence. It&#x27;s difficult for some to see how a concern for the other great apes advances this goal. On the other hand, there are many research contexts where the close evolutionary relationship between <i>Homo sapiens</i> and the other great apes makes the latter an extremely useful pool of specimens in situations where experimenting directly on the former would conflict with this goal. In other words, we need to clarify the justification for concern for the well-being of the other great apes.

But they are also the prime years for gaining coding chops, contributing to open source to get some experience, and so on.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m caught in a catch-22 situation - if I spend all my time coding, then my desire to interact with others (and others&#x27; desires to interact with me) decreases - because I become boring due to spending time only in my own skill development. This will have negative consequences - I miss out on opportunities cause nobody is an island. I also have emotional anxiety which impacts my productivity.\nBut if I spend time trying to socialize/trying to make plans/have a few easy-going days, then my skill stagnates and I feel that I&#x27;m losing sight of my endgoal (to be a better programmer). Then there will be no use of my network because I won&#x27;t have the capacity to create anything significant.<p>To clarify more, my drive to be a better programmer is because I want to have enough skill to create a hugely valuable and profitable startup.

10597316,comment,10595985,10596291,0,0,afarrell,,,"How do you know that your proposal would make the economy more unfriendly to Hispanics? Each time a business hires a citizen or legal immigrant, document fraud imposes a probability that you actually hire an illegal immigrant. If you raise the cost of accidentally hiring an illegal immigrant, you raise the cost of trying to hire a legal worker who looks similar to a population that stereotypically contains illegal immigrants.<p>Would that have an impact on the behavior of a rational business? Let&#x27;s do some math, admitting that this is kinda a Fermi problem.<p>So if you are running a limited-service restaurant that employs poor people,  and you have an employee working a 40-hr workweek at 7.35/hr, their yearly pay is $15,288. On top of that, you have an additional 15.3% ($2,329.88) [1] to pay for the employer&#x27;s portion of social security and Medicare tax, $420 for unemployment tax[2], and employer portion of federal income taxes[3] of 10% on the first $11.525 ($922.50) and $15 on the rest ($555.45). And payroll for that employee costs $19,455.83. For a limited service restaurant, payroll overall costs 25%-30%[4] of gross revenue. So (making the unjustified simplifying assumption that revenue comes from employees roughly proportional to their payroll costs.) for each such employee, the business makes $64,852.78-$77,823.34 in net revenue per employee. Or, $45,396.94-$58,367.50 in revenue per employee after payroll but before other cost (goods, equipment, utilities, rent, etc) which we will all assume are fixed. So, if a business is risk-neutral, all costs other than labor don&#x27;t effect decision-making, and we don&#x27;t account for the possibility of going out of business then your policy is a bad idea if the probability of accidentally hiring an illegal immigrant and getting caught is 4.54%-5.84%.<p>What is the probability of hiring an illegal immigrant if a business hires someone who, to them, looks Hispanic?<p>If there are 11 million[5] illegal immigrants in the US. Let&#x27;s say 7.35 million[6] of them are Hispanic/Latino in appearance (I&#x27;m talking about racial discrimination here, so the diversity of Hispanic peoples gets reduced to one question: Does a business owner think they &quot;look Hispanic&quot;?). One source[7], whose neutrality I doubt, claims that 75% of illegal immigrants have forged documents like social security cards. It would make sense that they would want to obtain documents that allow them to work, so lets assume that&#x27;s true. So than means 5.5 million Hispanic people with forged documents. There are 55 million[8] Hispanic people living in the U.S. That means that 10% of them are people with forged employment documents. Accounting for the fact that illegal immigrants are more likely to be in the low-income workforce than Hispanic citizens, it&#x27;s probably higher.<p>What is the probability of getting caught? I&#x27;m on a phone and too tired to continue this calculation and I&#x27;m on my phone. But if it was 0.45-0.58, then it would be prohibitively expensive for a risk-neutral rational business whose only cost was labor to hire someone who looked Hispanic. That sounds to like economic conditions that are unfavorable to poor Hispanic people.<p>Of course, you could fix this by adding a Mens Rea component to your proposal.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf</a>, page 31<p>[2] ibid, page 35<p>[3] ibid, page 46<p>[4] <a href=""http://smallbusiness.chron.com/percentage-should-restaurant-spend-payroll-24851.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smallbusiness.chron.com/percentage-should-restaurant-...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/24/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/24/5-facts-abou...</a><p>[6] ibid: 5.9 million from Mexico; pulled out of my ass: 1.45 million from elsewhere in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean.

If the USPS cannot afford the pensions they are promising now, how can it ever hope to afford it later.<p>Unfunded pensions have been a huge disaster at the local level. It&#x27;s leading Chicago and Illinois into bankruptcy. It&#x27;s easy for government to promise great retirement benefits if they don&#x27;t actually have to pay to provide them.<p>All government should have to fund any accrued benefit for employees.<p>And for businesses, any sort of accrued benefit goes on their books as a liability.

That is, if you&#x27;re compensating the employee with benefit X, you should book (the ROR-discounted present value of) that full liability now, irrespective of when you would have to eventually pay it. That one extra month of employee work earned them $100, 80 years from now?  Great, that should be $0.71 less you have to spend.  No 75-year cutoff. (Or 50, or 40, or 25).<p>Any other arrangement is forcing the employee to become an investor, in which case the usual protections should attach.<p>No company should be able to play the game of &quot;oh, man, we totally thought we&#x27;d be making bank 40 years on, bummer we can&#x27;t pay the rest of our worker&#x27;s employment compensation, tough s---.&quot;  And then you have situations like GM, Bethlehem Steel, etc.<p>Why is anyone cool with &quot;don&#x27;t worry, we&#x27;ll be profitable <i>later</i>&quot; when it comes to worker&#x27;s wages?

Oh so we discovered antibiotics? Great, but now we have to deal with increasing rates of diabetes, cancer, heart and immunodeficiency diseases. And even though some people would like to make us think that our life expectancy has gone up, that&#x27;s only true for the average because of increased expectancy at birth. Plus we are not measuring quality of life. You know, the only real progress we&#x27;ve made is in terms of education and individual rights.<p>I&#x27;m actually starting to think that the Industrial Age is the worst thing that could have happened to human kind.

By which I mostly mean stuff coming through the unix tradition like grep, regex, vi-keys etc.<p>You meet these things for the first time and think, why would I bother learning all that arcane knowledge just to do this one thing, but then later you realise that you can leverage that knowledge across a wide range of tools.\nObviously you mention C# and .Net so you swim in a different pond and are less likely to see the same level of reuse, but that doesn't mean it's not there.",1314025175

2912655,comment,2912564,2912564,1,0,dalke,,,"My first thought about the comparison to a Sierpinski triangle is that the more we work at it, the less there is. The author then totally avoids talking about the analogy mentioned in the title and instead makes a very different point.<p>The essay proposes that the close you get to a subject, the more complex and diverse the niches become. This correspondence to a fractal is tempting, but I wonder if the fractal requirement that there be some sort of self-similarity is applicable. Do disparate fields, close up, appear similar? If yes, is that a reflection of our own psychology?<p>Sometimes too the jumbled landscape disappears, as when evolution made many disparate fields merge into biology, or heliocentric theory made epicycles disappear .. only to find even more interesting lands beyond.",1314025158
2912654,comment,2911859,2911859,3,0,emanuer,,,"Lets imagine someone would want to build a ""retina display"" which's ppi value matches the maximum ppi of the human foveal vision. (fovea is the point of the eye with the highest density of rod & cone cells)<p>According to this article this is 530 ppi (pixel per inch)<p>Now, if my math is not entirely flawed (please check) for a 27 inch monitor with a 16x9 ratio this would mean a resolution of<p><pre><code>  12,472 x 7,015 \n</code></pre>\nThat is ~ 21 times higher than the best resolution available today, for such a screen. (2560x1600)<p>The iPhone 4 has 326 ppi and I just took off my glasses and I really had to focus until my eyes hurt to be able to see a single pixel. (I failed, I couldn't see one) Also I have to get really close on to my PC screen to see single pixels (235 ppi)<p>Now my question is, how could my retina have 530 ppi if I can not identify single pixels on a 326 ppi device?<p>Furthermore I fail to understand the most basic assumptions & calculation in this article:<p><pre><code>  > 53*60/.3 = 10600\n</code></pre>\n? Why did he multiply it times 10? Is this a calculation error, or am I just missing something?<p>Assuming that this calculation is correct and he just left a part out. I have problems understanding the first and most basic assumption:<p><pre><code>  > Thus, one needs two pixels per line pair, and that means pixel \n  > spacing of 0.3 arc-minute! \n\n  > 0.7 arc-minute, corresponds to the resolution of a spot as non-point source\n  > Again you need two pixels to say it is not a point\n\n  > Again, you need an minimum of 2 pixels to define a cycle\n</code></pre>\nIf I interpret the article correctly the ""line pair""/ ""spot""/ ""cycle"" in the 3 named experiments were all the smallest size which humans were able to identify. \nWhy do you need 2 pixels? Wouldn't anything below 0.6 arc-minutes already constitute as being below the smallest visible size?<p>If this point does not hold up, the entire following calculations are way off. I would be thankful if someone could enlighten me.<p>#Edit: as ristretto stated earlier, there are ~ 100 million cells in the human eye. There are only ~200 000 cells in the fovea. Also everything gets compressed and send through only ~ 1 million nerve cells. \nJust to be interpreted by 140 million neurons in the V1 area. Short: measuring the megapixel of the human eye is quite a fruitless exercise. The human eye does not work like a homogenous camera/monitor.<p>The maximum visible pixel per inch (ppi) on the other hand have serious implications to technology and hardware development. Therefor I have much greater interest in this metric.",1314025133

Using a naming convention is much less robust.<p>If you need to pass in something that doesn't need to be escaped, you switch off the escaping explicitly (`<% var name ESCAPE=NONE %>`), and/or you put HTML strings into a separate type which doesn't get escaped upon substitution.<p>For example the template engine would return a `HTMLString` instead of a `String` object, so that it never accidentally encodes twice (as could happen in the case of includes).",1314024913

What basis is there for saying that ""vision"" counts for 15% and ""financial mgmt expertise"" for 25%? These are not comparable things and you can't throw numbers on them. At most you can say things like ""financial mgmt is a must, and of all that have it, we want the ones with the best vision"". You still have to define these...<p>2) How are you supposed to give such fine-grained numeric grades to candidates on things like ""vision""?<p>3) What do you do with the chart once you have it? This is the part of the post that makes it look like a parody - he has these charts for two candidates and says ""now it's easy as pie to choose"", but neither chart looks hugely better than the other. Are you supposed to compare the areas with grid paper? That makes no sense and may leave you with a candidate that lacks something crucial.<p>4) This brings me to my final point - you may be looking for things in a candidate that are pass/fail, e.g. in his chart ""dealing with government regulators"" looks like a <i>sine qua non</i> thing. His method could well result in overlooking this.<p>I don't get why people are calling this insightful and so on. This is extremely similar to a ton of competencies matrix methods, but this way of presenting the results is particularly bad.",1314023927

Also, in terms of market share the XSS auditor is going to be supported by a bigger user base than CSP. It's also important to note that the XSS auditor is disabled on other Google sites primarily because it hasn't been tested for compatibility--not because it can be misused by an attacker.<p>As for CSP support in Chrome, it's currently available if you set a vendor-specific header. (That's the normal way to handle an experimental standard that's still in flux.) My personal opinion on CSP is that it's a bit of an overly complicated mess.

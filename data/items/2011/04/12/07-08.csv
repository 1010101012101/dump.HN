If you're early in your career, this means building up your skills (and certs, if you're in IT) to the point where you feel very confident that you can get another job quickly if necessary. If you're more advanced in your career, it means keeping your networks/skills fresh and possibly doing some freelancing on the side.<p>It's not even just about salary negotiation; knowing you can walk away whenever you want to (and actually believing that you will if you decide to) gives you the freedom to take risks and just have more fun at your job in general.",1302594989
2436325,comment,2435620,2435919,4,0,derleth,,,"> pirated software is often more user-friendly.<p>If you go back to the 1970s and certainly by the 1980s, this was true of pirated/cracked software for systems like the Apple ][ and Commodore 64. Specifically, by removing copy protection stuff (which often relied on specific aspects of floppy drive hardware) the cracking groups could fit multiple games on a single floppy, a great boon in an era when downloading software meant dialling up a BBS and transferring it over a 1200 baud line.<p>So I suppose there's two lessons here: DRM hasn't worked for over 30 years of trying, and DRM crackers still know how to release a good product.",1302594984

People wishfully hope that they get paid based on their contribution/skill level, but there are so many additional factors that come into play.<p>In all the technical teams (sysadmins, dbas etc) that I've managed, I've consistently seen variations of between $50k-100k between the lowest and highest paid person <i>of the same skill</i> (ie I'm not comparing junior to senior staff).<p>The things I learned as a manager:<p>* Always know what the market is paying for your skills. Even if you are not looking for another job, remain subscribed to job websites so you understand what the market is after and what it is paying<p>* Sharing salary information with people you trust is incredibly valuable - you need to know where you stand. It's in the companies best interests to keep everyone in the dark - it means you won't know your true worth.<p>* If you love your job, by all means stay - but make sure you aren't using that as an excuse to cover up the fact that you are scared to make a jump, or that your ego is wrapped up in your job title. There are no medals for long service - and as companies (in my experience) generally only pay market rates to external hires, you are better jumping jobs every few years than staying in the one place. You'll develop more skills, earn more money, and I believe in the long term more employable.",1302594784

2436313,comment,2431401,2431903,1,0,6ren,,,"Hey! I already mentioned narrowing it down to a family of choices. ;-)<p>Both these tricks are used by IDE's (and e.g. vim). But this is still thinking in terms of a touch front-end to a conventional language. I'm suggesting an <i>intrinsically</i> touch language - so well-fitted to touch, that a <i>text</i> front-end would be awkward (and difficult to even imagine).<p>I like your point about choices. It seems that however it was done, it would always boil down to making choices (in some way) among alternatives (of some kind). I also seems we'd need ""methods"" (or, to be more general, ""verbs"": for something to be done).<p>A way to specify what a method does (instead of using instructions) is to actually do it - as macros are implemented in vim and office. Like the writer's admonishment: <i>show, don't tell</i>. But to invoke a method, you still need to choose it in some way - so there's the choice problem you mention again. Maybe the subset of choices available could be constrained by a strict hierarchy of macros... or maybe we could just admit that this doesn't work well with touch, and instead restrict it to a Domain Specific (toy) Language, for very specific and common tasks (rather like the macros of vim and office are arguably DSLs). You don't have to have recursion or turing completeness for a <i>tool</i> to be delightfully useful <i>for the job</i> (e.g. hammers and cars aren't turing complete).<p>But I just have a nagging feeling that there is a way to do a touch-based general programming language... start by going back to basics and thinking about how we reason and communicate in practice (e.g. in the physical real world) - instead of being trapped by the elaborate programming languages that we happen to be familiar with. Solving the <i>actual problem</i>, not forcing a preconceived solution.<p>What about speech for choice of verbs? touch + ""this one goes here"".\nSeems pretty intuitive and workable actually....",1302594441

2436308,comment,2434333,2434333,1,0,bgalbraith,,,"Apologies if this has been suggested before.<p>I'm curious if something like the BCS ranking system in college football could work for online communities. The specifics don't translate, but the general idea is that you use a weighted combination of human and machine generated rankings. This can be seen as maintaining the user-driven voting system but tempered with an impartial community spirit moderator in the form of a machine learning algorithm.<p>How could this be applied to HN? Let's leave the standard karma/voting system as it exists, as that seems to generally work.<p>Next, determine the general distribution of votes per comment. This will allow for things like z-scores to be determined that can notice if a particular comment has received significantly more votes than usual.<p>Next, perform a machine learning algorithm on a corpus of comments. Something as straightforward as Bayesian filters can work, though self-organizing maps also have potential. This is effectively doing the same thing as spam filtering, but instead of simply flagging something as spam, it would provide its own +/- vote. The initial training would start with a baseline of existing comments, and then periodically, say once a night, be updated with recently added comments and votes. Additional information, such as the karma of the commenter, can also be incorporated.<p>The final ranking then, which here would be how high up on the page it appears, would be a weighted combination of user votes, z-score scaling, and machine votes.",1302594345

Every time the annual pay review came around, any permanent staff would get a token 2-3% raise and that would be it. Team leaders would be given 3% to spread around their team, so the only way for any individual developer to get a more-than-inflation raise, would be at the direct expense of another developer in their team. Not exactly conducive to good team moral!<p>In the end, the only effective way to get a reasonable pay rise was to either change jobs (giving you a chance to jump salary bands), or to leave the company, wait for 6 months or so, and then reapply for another job. The advantage being that this time around, you would know the likelihood of getting a decent raise after you started, so you would be a lot more insistent about coming on-board at a decent rate.<p>Whenever HR was questioned about this policy, their answer was basically to shrug and say something to the effect of: ""We need to pay market rate to acquire new talent - once you're working here you're unlikely to leave a stable job, so we don't need to pay you as much money to retain you"".<p>Personally, I left (with the intention of coming back in 6 months or so).

If you have more than $2 million in assets then it is automatically assumed you are giving up the pass for tax reasons, otherwise it shouldn't be a problem.<p>> In addition, tax information is now shared with INS, so you can be barred entry from the US or end up getting carted off to somewhere you don't want to go if you don't have all of your ducks in a row.<p>This will be my biggest worry if I end up giving back my passport.

Start a person at, say, 0.6 votes at 16. 
Voting in a state or national election = +.1/year, up to two times.
Graduation High School or getting a GED = +.1.<p>So a motivated 18 year old has 1 vote, just like now, slackers are a little behind but not much.<p>Graduating College, OR 3 Years of Military Service, OR Passing a (Somewhat tough) Written Test of Govt/Econ/International Studies = +0.2<p>Graduate Degree OR 8 (total) Years of Military Service OR Passing a (LSAT Difficulty) Written Test = +0.2<p>Graduate Degree in Econ/<Whatever Gov't Applicable Majors> OR 2 Years Gov't Service = +0.1<p>So a college grad is worth +20% of a 'normal' adult, but twice a high-school dropout nonvoter who's put no effort into it. And someone with a PhD in Economics is only a third of a vote ahead of a college grad, but worth 1.5 18- year-olds, and 2.5 people who've never voted.<p>Hopefully by keeping the military/service side roughly equal, we could keep the ideological balance about the same.<p>Intelligent, Motivated non-traditional people, especially those too poor or busy for college could still get to the highest ranks without any cost other than proving that they understand the basics at rough parity.<p>You're going to get crackpots with degrees/credentials just like you do now, but I'd argue that as a whole, educated people make better decisions with respect to politics (even, I would go so far as to say, in a party agnostic way), so the bad eggs will cancel out.<p>I'm a voting, high-school educated college dropout myself, but I'd definitely go and learn whatever I would need for the highest level, even if it took a few hours a week for months/years, but I'm also unusually interested in the subject(s).<p>Once again, the idea is nuts and would never work in the current system, but there's nothing wrong with a little thought experiment =).",1236799374

   I considered him to be an asset, so when I told him about one of my start-up ideas, I expected he'd translate his academic execution into product execution. Definitely not the case.  It was 6 months before I realized this guy was brilliant, but failed to connect the dots in real applications. He just did not have the personal drive to get anything done, nor did he *care*. And this was someone who initially showed a lot interest, and wasn't even a threat!

   My point is that even people who may seem like they may be a threat to copy your idea, probably do not even care enough to pursue it.

Put it this way - if a lot of javascript operations could modify a piece of global state, that would be trivial on a trivial interpreter, but I bet it would add a lot of complexity to your JIT.

Their argument was that the server was DoSing department&#x27;s DNS servers.<p>Turns out that one of students had a very inefficiently written application, the application was making a separate TCP connection to insert a row into a database and of course there were tons of data to be imported. The server then made reverse name resolution on every request and in turn made DNS query for every row inserted in the database.<p>The DNS problem was solved by installing bind and setting it up as a caching server. Of course now we have other services just for caching such as unbound, nscd, dnsmasq etc.<p>The thing is that DNS caching is essential part of a network enabled operating system and even if you don&#x27;t care about DoSing your ISPs DNS server it still brings a huge benefit by speeding up name resolution. I can&#x27;t think of a scenario when you wouldn&#x27;t need a DNS caching server and it looks like other OSes already include one built in, so why not standardize it?",1408561096

[Citation Needed]<p>What I remember is that Amazon <i>created</i> the e-book space, for all intents and purposes.<p>And the reason they undercut the royalty price was to create that market. People didn&#x27;t want to spend $20 or more to buy an electronic copy of a book they could buy for less in physical form. People aren&#x27;t stupid: If they aren&#x27;t getting a physical item they can then hand to their friends and/or sell, then what they&#x27;re getting has less value.<p>Heck, I still get annoyed by crazy-high eBook prices. An eBook should absolutely ALWAYS cost less than the physical copy. If there are 500 copies available used for $0.01 on Amazon, then it shouldn&#x27;t be more than about $5 (paying a bit for the convenience of having a digital copy -- those $0.01 copies typically add ~$4 in shipping costs), and yet you can find $8-10 price on a Kindle edition.

8203856,comment,8203361,8203361,12,0,terhechte,,,"Here&#x27;s a good explanation of what the software tries to achieve, from one of the files in the Github repo. Much more informative than the Wired article:<p>Here&#x27;s a concrete example: A police department in a city hosts an Excel spreadsheet on their web server called Crime-2013.xls. It contains all of the reported crime so far this year and gets updated every night at midnight with all of the new crimes that were reported each day.<p>Say you wanted to write a web application that showed all of the crime on a map. To download the new data every night you&#x27;d have to write a custom program that downloads the .xls file every night at midnight and imports it into your application&#x27;s MySQL database.<p>To get the fresh data imported you can simply delete your entire local crime database and re-import all rows from the new .xls file, a process known as a &#x27;kill and fill&#x27;.<p>But the kill and fill method isn&#x27;t very robust, for a variety of messy reasons. For instance, what if you cleaned up some of the rows in the crime data in your local database after importing it last time? Your edits would get lost.<p>Another option is a manual merge, where you try and import each and every row of the incoming Excel file one at a time. If the data in the row already exists in the database, skip it. If the row already exists but the incoming data is a new version, overwrite that row. If the row doesn&#x27;t exist yet, make a whole new row in the database.<p>The manual merge can be tricky to implement. In your import script you will have to write the logic for how to check if an incoming row already exists in your database. Does the Excel file have its own Crime IDs that you can use to look up existing records, or are you searching for the existing record by other method? Do you assume that the incoming row should completely overwrite the existing row, or do you try to do a full row merge?<p>At this point the import script is probably a few dozen lines and is very specific to both the police department&#x27;s data as well as your application&#x27;s database. If you decide to switch from MySQL to PostgreSQL in the future you will have to revisit this script and re-write major parts of it.<p>If you have to do things like clean up formatting errors in the Police data, re-project geographic coordinates, or change the data in other ways there is no straightforward way to share those changes publicly. The best case scenario is that you put your import script on GitHub and name it something like &#x27;City-Police-Crime-MySQL-Import&#x27; so that other developers that want to consume the crime data in your city won&#x27;t have to go through all the work that you just went through.<p>Sadly, this workflow is the state of the art. Open data tools are at a level comparable to source code management before version control.<p><a href=""https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/docs/what-is-dat.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/docs/what-is-dat...</a>",1408560757

I built out my business, boot strapped my startup for 6 months and had a strong idea of my product vision.  As I hadn&#x27;t been particularly happy with my engineering team prior- i decided to start fresh with the perfect technical cofounder to build our product.  I spoke to a lot of people about what they envisioned for the technical cofounder role for my product and then made a &#x27;dream resume&#x27; of that candidate along with the personality traits that would be the ying to my yang.  Once I had a good idea of what I was looking for- I went through every single software engineer connection on linkedin to see if anyone might be a match.  A woman who had moved into my old room when I moved out of my house had the exact background for what I was looking for (product driven creative software engineer).  I got her involved in our market research study and then asked her for drinks under the premise that she had the exact resume and personality of what I was looking for in a technical cofounder-so what would I need to do in order to find a woman like her and get her to start this company with me.  She really loved my idea and more importantly, saw the opportunity for herself to build a really cool product from scratch.  We are both in similar places in our career and she 180% had the drive and intelligence to start a company and build our product and technology.  She said during the meeting that she was actually interested and wanted to meet the rest of the team.  We spent two months working together, getting to know each other and really thinking through the product. She met with all of my advisors and poured through our research.  We had discussions about communications, got into our first tiff and had multiple discussions about timeline and career goals before sealing the deal.  We share many passions like art, music and most importantly, helping women with their careers. Now that she is my technical cofounder, so many amazing things have happened. She&#x27;s very talented and has the type of personality that attracts good tech & design talent.  We work well together because we spent time communicating what we would both need to make this work for us.  So figure out what you need, design that dream candidate, go find her or him and take the time to &#x27;date&#x27; them till you are both comfortable moving forward.  My relationship with her is now the most important one in my life right now and our attention to communicating is what has propelled our product development and our team&#x27;s growth.",1408560436

Women applying for jobs in a field where there is a perception of sexism might be deterred from applying in the first place, especially if they feel they don&#x27;t have the skills to outshine the men who apply; men may be more likely to apply even if their skills are only marginal for the role, because the industry has given them a disproportionate confidence in their abilities. So you might see a 16% female application rate, yet have women make up 30% of competent candidates, but still wind up at 22% women hired, which would not be the evidence of positive discrimination you suggest at all.<p>The way sexism in hiring decisions works is subtle. Development is a team sport. When a candidate comes to you and tells you &#x27;I worked on this highly respected game,&#x27; you are impressed, but need to try to figure out what their contribution was to the team. Did they solve the really hard shader engineering challenges that gave that game its unique look while maintaining 60fps? Did they just do a bit of coding on the menu system? Did they do nothing but make the coffee? So you ask, but <i>your prejudices color how you hear the response</i>. If you tend to assume that girls just don&#x27;t do quaternions and stuff, you hear &#x27;I worked on the water simulation&#x27; and if it&#x27;s a guy you assume they did a bunch of stuff with physics and navier stokes equations, but if it&#x27;s a woman you interpret it as &#x27;I made the sparkly bits when things go splash&#x27;. If you&#x27;re gender-blind you allow the possibility that the person in front of you might fall into either of those camps regardless of their gender.<p>And it goes beyond hiring, into work assignments. You&#x27;ve got two pieces of work that need to be done: one is going to involve hard math, the other is building tools to help the testers QA stuff. Unconsciously, you let your prejudices about gender roles play in and assign the math work to a male coder and the tool to a female coder. Subtly, you push the women to less prestigious roles that limit their career options, while giving men opportunities to advance theirs.<p>And then when your studio goes belly-up and those two coders are applying for work elsewhere, which one has the more impressive resume and is able to get in the door somewhere else?",1408560358

It looked good, but their process smelled a bit off.  I did a bit more investigation, and found that anonymous interview reports claimed a high difficulty, with zero offers.  Anonymous salary reports claimed below-median pay and benefits.  So I looked up the company on a specialized search site and found that it had several H-1B applications, most of which were software-related.  One was a very close match to the job posting.<p>This gave me the seed of an idea.  I could use the paperwork for a company&#x27;s visa sponsorships to either automatically reject job postings as below my pay grade, or as useful information for the interviews and any potential salary negotiations.  The law requires that companies keep a &quot;Public Access File&quot; at their primary place of business, to be presented on demand to any interested person.  One required element in this file is the amount the company expects to pay for a position with a given set of job requirements.<p>But this particular company has so far been very evasive about giving the public actual access to their Public Access Files.  It may just be them, and that I would have better luck formulating my new screening criterion using some other company&#x27;s public records.  I just want to look over some samples and find something I can easily use.<p>Does anyone have any experience with or suggestions about obtaining and using a company&#x27;s H-1B Public Access File?

A client of mine is running systemd in prod, and I&#x27;m managing their system - so when I tell you this, what I&#x27;m saying is &quot;whoever explained either isn&#x27;t running systemd in prod on multiple machines, or is having a wildly different experience than I am.&quot; Ask whoever explained this to you if they are running systemd in prod! I would love to be wrong about this!<p>I feel like I hear this explanation (excuse?) fairly often, so instead of setting up a straw man, lemme flip the script here:<p>Could someone - anyone! - please point out a single distro or OSS project that a) makes use of systemd and b) doesn&#x27;t end up building the same exact monolithic init.d re-implementation as everyone else running systemd?<p>Systemd <i>could</i> potentially be used as a suite of independent tools, kinda, I guess - but that&#x27;s not what the devs are aiming for from what I can tell, and I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> seen - or even heard discussion about - systemd being used in practice as anything besides a monolithic init.d replacement. Most arguments to the contrary fall apart really quickly, with a simple question:<p>&quot;How and why would you actually build this theoretical pick-your-own-utils-totally-not-a-monolith thing you&#x27;re describing? Please show your work. Extra credit: explain why no one else appears to have attempted this, outside of the thought experiment that I&#x27;ve just proposed to you&quot;.<p>My guess is, like it or not, I&#x27;m going to be stuck using systemd-resolve (the DNS resolver) and systemd-timesync (the NTPD replacement), I&#x27;m guessing, because I want to use systemd-network, and the best case scenario is that my old ntpd and nsd daemons are going to have some weird issue working properly with systemd-network.

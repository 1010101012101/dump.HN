That's fine. Everyone likes to have their time under the spotlight, but that's what this is all about. Exclusivity? Invites? A list of high-profile people to show off on the front page (not needed at all, btw)? ""You're welcome"" strewn on the footer? Yep, you're in ego territory.<p>- Exactly.

I'm convinced that it's a policy that everyone knows has little benefit and yet pushes for ethical brownie points. What's to be gained from freeing up the data far, far exceeds what could potentially be lost.<p>Even freeing up anonymized patient data seems to be met with opposition. Imagine the data analysis that can be done on millions and millions of patient cases and the clinical/treatment models that can emerge as a result.<p>Medicine right now is an old, stiff wooden board bending under the weight of technological innovation. Something's going to snap and I'm looking forward to see it happen.<p>I really support what you're doing, and if you want design help, my email is in my profile. Best of luck!",1332532728

3746879,comment,3745653,3746206,1,0,AgentConundrum,,,"I am also a layman, but I think the answer to your first question is ""it depends"". Specifically, it depends on the length of our mixed meta password and the length of your passphrase.<p>I ran the numbers for passwords up to 30 characters long and made a chart in Excel showing the total possible passwords, one to thirty characters long, given a variety of character spaces, using the form s^l (character space to the power of password length). [1] The weakest space I used was lowercase characters only (26), the most complex was ""all keyboard characters"" (96). (In between are various combinations of lowercase, uppercase, numerics, common punctuation, and all punctuation. It's not entirely relevant to my point though.)<p>One interesting point I found was that a purely lowercase password only needs to be 30 characters long to beat an ""everything on the keyboard"" password of 22 characters, and is a <i>lot</i> easier to remember.<p>One serious point to consider is that passphrases aren't the same thing as ""lowercase-only"" passwords. If you consider each word as a ""character"" you could use a dictionary to brute force it, meaning that rather than brute forcing the series as [""a"", ""b"", ... ""z"", ""aa"", etc.] you could brute force it as [""an"", ""as"", ... ""an account"", ""an acorn"", etc.].<p>Personally, all of my passwords but one are ridiculous mixed passwords that I don't even know. The last password is the password to my KeePass database, which is a longish passphrase (also the phrase I use doesn't make any damn sense, which is sort of the point). The idea is that long mixed passwords are hard to remember but are more secure than an identically long phrase, so I want to use those as much as possible, but because it's essential that I remember the KeePass password (because forgetting it would lock me out of <i>everything</i>), a passphrase works as a memorable but still complex password.<p>I'm not entirely sure I've done any of my work correctly, so I'll just sit here and wait for Thomas or Colin to come in and take me to school.<p>[1] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/4tMEX.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/4tMEX.png</a>",1332532216

Studies since 2009 (mentioned in the abstract) in the amygdala have been able to direct and inactivate fear memories in a reversible manner via optogenetics again (see <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2844777/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2844777/</a>) . In these studies killing as much as 15% of the cells did not erase the memory, indicating that it's ensembles, not single neurons that encode fear memories.<p>To complicate the picture even more, each neuron is part of more than one memory engrams, and memories are stored in synaptic connections which are formed in the vast dendritic trees of neurons. So you have a very sparse and reduntant encoding of this associative memory.<p>Finally, note that both the amygdala and the hippocampus are very old structures so we don't know if the same processes take place in the neocortex (although it's likely so).<p>I don't mean to belittle the article, but it's mostly proof of concept if you have followed the relative literature.

For an example, say you search Github for ""while.""  Github used to do language facets, where it would tell you that out of a million results, 200103 files were in javascript, 500358 files were in C, etc.<p>The problem with this is that you have to count over a million records, on every search!  Unlike most search operations which are IO bound, the counting can be CPU-bound, so sharding on one box will let you take advantage of multiple cores.<p>Racoonone is ""sorting on two dimensions, a geo bounding box, four numeric range filters, one datetime range filter, and a categorical range filter.""  This should put him in a cpu-bound range (in particular because of the sort).<p>Websolr has customers on sharded plans, but they are usually used in custom sales cases where we're serving many, many millions of documents.  We'll look at adding sharding as an option to our default plans, so that they'll be more accessible for people like raccoonone.  In the meantime, if you send an email to info@onemorecloud.com, we'll try to accomodate use cases like this.<p>Edit: Also, other possible optimizations include (1) indexing in the same order you will sort on, if you know ahead of time, and (2) using the TimeLimitedCollector.",1332531927

3746775,comment,3744841,3744841,5,0,cdcox,,,"That title is incorrect. These researchers did not stimulate one neuron to activate one memory. They stimulated a group of neurons in one region using a fiber optic.<p>I'll go through the experiment for those who don't really get the write up. Quick background:<p>0. Neurons are specialized cells in your brain, their firing is the basis of cognition. Neurons that fire strongly together tend to get linked. Not all your neurons are firing all at once. Not all neurons participate in a memory, but a large collection (0.1-4% depending on brain region) are used for each memory. (at least in naive mice) Memories are highly distributed across brain regions and within brain regions.<p>1. There is a gene 'cFos' that turns on in neurons that undergo activity. It is very short lasting, about an hour, and then it is back down. It is very cell specific, only cells used have been activated will show this gene.<p>2. There is a genetically inducable protein you can put in cells so that when you shine them with light they will start firing.<p>3. Anything genetically inducible can have a tag added that will make it impossible to induce when an animal is on a specific drug. (We'll call it Dox.)<p>The researchers made it so that when cFos is activated, it will transcribe the inducible light activated channel. But, it will only do this when the animal isn't on Dox. So they took the animal off Dox, exposed it to fear conditioning (they shocked it in a unique box), then put it back on Dox. So only the cells that were active during the fear conditioning will be turn on when they shine light.<p>They then put the animal in a new box and shined light, and the animal froze. (A sign it was afraid) They concluded that activating cells that had been active during the storing of the memory can 'reactivate' the memory, even out of it's context.<p>Of course there are a few major problems with this. The region of the brain they worked in is a relatively minor area of the brain. They admit in the course of the paper that each cell is used to store many memories. (They claim the assembly of cells activate the memory? But they never bother testing this.) Their firing pattern is far from physiological. The mice who underwent this 'memory reactivation' did not freeze as much as mice in normal fear conditioning and did not seem to learn the 'reactivated memory' at all. (Though again they didn't really bother testing this.) Normal fear-memory is learned quite well. This is a very preliminary but very important study in the field. It will be interesting to see how they follow this up.<p>Also, the Npas4 stuff is completely irrelevant to this article. There are countless markers that when 'knocked out' make it impossible to store memory.<p>Also here is a (paywalled) link to the paper:<a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vnfv/ncurrent/full/nature11028.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vnfv/ncurrent/full/natu...</a><p>Here is a link to another (paywalled) paper which came out today which did almost the same thing and say almost opposite results (the details explain this oddity): <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6075/1513.full?rss=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6075/1513.full?rss=1</a><p>Here is a (paywalled) more layperson write up to the second article: <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6075/1455.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6075/1455.full</a>",1332530936

That was as much because of the great explanations atop's manual provided for the metrics it could display as it was because I wanted to learn the interactive commands.<p>Some things about htop that I could see as friendlier:<p>* Htop scrolls with the arrow keys, while atop uses ^F and ^B.<p>* Htop displays a reminder for some commonly-used commands at the bottom of the screen (e.g. that you need to press 'F1' for help), whereas in atop you have to remember the commands or look them up by pressing 'h' or '?'.<p>* Htop displays gauges for system-level activity. I think this is a bad tradeoff, though:<p><pre><code>    CPU | sys      0% | user      1% | irq       0% | idle    799% | wait      0% |\n    MEM | tot    7.8G | free    5.7G | cache 735.6M | buff  351.2M | slab  248.1M \n\n</code></pre>\nis much more useful than<p><pre><code>    Avg[|                                        0.2%]\n    Mem[|||||||||||||||||                 1008/7967MB]\n</code></pre>\nThere are features of htop that I wish atop had. For example, the toggleable display of threads, the tree view, and integration with strace and lsof. Even without those I find atop more useful, but YMMV.<p>The killer feature for atop is logging per-process performance data and reviewing it after the fact.",1332529639

At my last job, the initial implementation they we involved storing the full text of millions of documents, even though they never needed to be retrieved (just searched). If you're running Solr as a front-end search for another database, the best way I've seen to optimize performance is just to make sure you're not storing data unnecessarily.<p>Maybe everyone already should already know this, but I was working on a very smart team, and we totally missed this initially. Setting ""stored"" to false for most fields resulted in a 90% reduction of the index size, which means less to fit into RAM.",1332529589

3746593,comment,3736037,3746313,1,0,hermannj314,,,"I agree that there are contexts where calling a woman a ""girl"" is demeaning and condescending.  This is clear.  And I think labeling a word as ""demeaning"" requires one of two things: a subjective component (the response of the person at whom the word was directed believing the word was demeaning) or an objective component (the intent of the speaker of the word intending it to be demeaning).  I think if we agree with this, it isn't hard to fabricate examples where calling an adult female a ""girl"" is, in fact, demeaning.<p>Now if we agree on that, then to make any absolute claim that calling a woman a ""girl"" is demeaning then we must either make some universal claim about the intent of all those who use the word or a universal claim about the reaction of all those that hear it.  I think either of those claims might be overreaching.  Or maybe I'm just setting the bar too high.<p>We obviously live in different parts of the world with different social expectations for language use.  Beyond a certain point, arguing about when it is ok to say woman or girl is just pointless bickering over divergent cultural expectations and nothing more.<p>I respect your viewpoint, you have definitely made me think.

Remember that it was invented before HTTP even existed. It was developed at a time where the only contender was Usenet. Internet was not yet used for any commercial purposes; there was no concept of platform. Internet, and thus email, was the medium between universities that we know of.

But again, there are only a few thousand slots available each year at top law schools, so for the vast majority of programmers this can&#x27;t work. Just a few hundred each year taking your advice would change the equation.<p>>Say you spend $300k on law school. Over a 30 year career, you only have to make an average of $10k extra per year to break even.<p>That&#x27;s true, but the average is more than $300k. The average programmers makes $93k a year, since he can work 3 fewer years because of the 3 years in law school, that&#x27;s $279K in lost wages + $150k for law school.<p>Sure the lawyer will likely eventually pull ahead, but extra money near retirement is worth less than money early on. If the programmer invests the extra money early on, the lawyer may never actually pull ahead.<p>>&quot;The &quot;Jobs Data&quot; tab offers more details: &quot;79.2% of graduates were known to be employed in long-term, full-time legal jobs&quot;<p>Legal jobs doesn&#x27;t mean working as an attorney, or jobs requiring a law degree. It could mean $15 an hour paralegal work, so that statistic isn&#x27;t useful.<p>>The number of software jobs are expected to grow, but is the growth going to be in jobs you really want, or will they all be for 23-year-old coding bootcamp grads?<p>That&#x27;s possible, but the new jobs for lawyers could be just as bad. From the Bureau of Labor Statistics &quot;Some recent law school graduates who have been unable to find permanent positions are turning to the growing number of temporary staffing firms that place attorneys in short-term jobs.&quot;<p>Software has been eating into jobs that were traditionally done by lawyers, and it will continue to do so.<p>On top of this, lawyers are limited to practicing in states where they have passed the bar exam, meaning their ability to move to find jobs is much more limited.<p>>Again, who cares about the nationwide averages? The 50th percentile Northwestern law grad makes $160k right out of school, and is on track make several times that as a law firm partner, or somewhat less as in-house counsel.<p>And they admit about 200 new students per year. So yes, if you can get into Northwestern and you like law, then it&#x27;s a good decision.<p>>(though they do work much longer and less predictable hours than programmers).<p>That&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> caveat. The average programmer could have been the average lawyer instead, worked more hours each week at a higher stress job so that by that he can break even in 20 years, and spend the last 10-20 years of his career making a bit more money.<p>If you like law and can get into a good school, then practice law. But I hardly think the extra, debt, stress, and hours worked makes it worth it for purely economic reasons.<p>>When someone describes the downsides of their job, I take it with a grain of salt. Often, it&#x27;s a case of &quot;the grass is always greener&quot;.<p>This would be the case for both programmers and lawyers, but job satisfaction surveys show that lawyers consistently rank near the bottom below programmers.",1436046740

9831697,comment,9830792,9830792,0,0,illza,,,"Similar to just about anything I read these days about parenting, I found some things I agreed with and a few that I don&#x27;t.  What has always been troubling to me however, is &quot;our&quot; (society, media, whomever) propensity to blame our children&#x27;s activities for the disconnect between what they enjoy doing and what we, as parents, think they should be doing.<p>There are benefits that can be obtained from playing games, video or otherwise.  I, personally, have used pokemon to teach reading, story-telling, math, strategy, problem solving, and a myriad of other things to my oldest son.  His brother isn&#x27;t far behind him.  We play minecraft, smash bros, mario kart; I even recently introduced him to portal 2.  Some of what I let him do is for fun.  Some is to gauge his interest in things.  Other times I use the time to teach him something new.  But the biggest factor of this strategy working is and will almost always be parental involvement.<p>Most of the backlash I see/hear/read about from other parents is due primarily to an unwillingness to get interested in what their children are interested in.  They&#x27;ll buy them the game and go enjoy some &quot;peace and quiet&quot; and never think twice about it.  There&#x27;s something to be said of a parent really taking an interest and learning about a new universe with their children.  I&#x27;m far from perfect, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been attempting, and it&#x27;s working out pretty well so far.<p>There was a quote in an Orson Scott Card book, &quot;The Lost Gate&quot; where the main character speaks of his sort-of adopted mother/trainer/mentor where he mentions that &quot;Love ... it&#x27;s a term for the woman in my life who loves me enough to read the novels I&#x27;m reading just so she can try to figure out what they&#x27;re teaching me.&quot;<p>TL;DR - Games aren&#x27;t inherently good or bad.  But it&#x27;s up to the parent to actually do the parenting.  They can&#x27;t just throw a &quot;good video game&quot; in front of their children and expect them to magically grow into engineers or doctors.",1436046004

9831687,comment,9830792,9830792,0,0,lookbothways,,,"The elephant in the room here is that children in the 21st century have little to no freedom or personal control. The days of packs of children running around town or exploring the woods are long gone, due to fears of dangerous men and accidents. Children wake up, are shuttled to school, then either come back and are locked in their homes for the rest of the day, or else are shuttled off to another extracurricular activity. Nothing is unsupervised, and nothing is spontaneous. No where is this more clear than in the concept of a &quot;play date,&quot; that a parent must schedule a meeting between two children instead of just, you know, letting them walk down the street and ring a doorbell when they feel like it.<p>The internet is like a parallel universe based around the exact opposite rules.

There is no structure or goal to it, just the freedom to wander about a crude approximation of the natural world, go on adventures by yourself or with friends, and build things with your own two hands.

9831678,comment,9830232,9830232,0,0,paulojreis,,,"This is a very interesting subject. At least for me, as it draws on two of my passions: HCI/UX/usability and, well, music.<p>I think this kind of approach is <i>defined</i> essentially by a closer mapping between the sheet and the physical world (which is, according to usability tenets, something good). So, under this &quot;definition&quot;, we can consider other approaches which are very popular and indeed work: guitar tabs and &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;-like games.<p>In the wise words of Thom Yorke, &quot;anyone can play guitar&quot;, and I think this is - nowadays - mostly due to guitar tabs. Tabs make it very easy to step into guitar playing. So, I think, it&#x27;s not a surprise that these approaches are so popular, as they have a easier learning curve for beginners, which is in itself also not a surprise if we consider the usability principle of close mapping with the real world. Traditional music notation just has more layers of translation, so to speak.<p>So, what are the drawbacks of this? I can think of three, which might explain why these approaches aren&#x27;t promptly adopted by traditional music education:<p>1) As this is, essentially, a closer mapping to the physical world, said mapping has to be &quot;done&quot; to a specific instrument. An alternative notation such as this one or guitar tabs wouldn&#x27;t be very helpful for, e.g., wind instruments. So, with this we would create specific &quot;languages&quot;. Arguably, having musicians understand an universal language is a good thing - I&#x27;m no piano player, but I can read a piano sheet;<p>2) Repertoire, generally. The amount of music written in traditional notation is just huge, the inertia to start writing stuff with a different notation would be a problem;<p>3) Dynamics: I think these approaches overlook dynamics. It&#x27;s not only about what and how long you play, it also about <i>how</i> you play it. For wind instruments, e.g., the dynamics can get quite complex - if a pianist has to read 5 notes, a flute player has to read one but with 5 dynamics annotations. This is, however, somewhat addressed in guitar tabs, as there are quite excellent tabs with not only dynamics annotations but also instrument-specific techniques. Maybe, in this approach, circle sizing could be used to communicate velocity?",1436045520

Also that a voting ring had been established such that ordinary users could never get stories off the bottom spots - they simply got duplicated by part of the &#x27;diggerati&#x27; and the alternate story gained the early traction needed to launch it to the top pages. Thus the apparent notoriety, the focus that people crave, that pays users back for their submissions was missing from the loop. Then the redesign came and rubbed everyone up the wrong way; but it seemed to me more like the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back (i.e. the last in a line of bad things) rather than a reason in itself.<p>Similar things have happened at Slashdot, user disenfranchisement as the (new) owners try to screw out every last cent from the site forgetting it needs the community to be what it is. Hit with a second punch of not entirely well executed redesign and you&#x27;ve got problems.<p>But then I think HN perhaps goes the other way, the more I stay the more I hanker after some simple redesign to address the site&#x27;s deficiencies (collapsing comments threads for example, spacing the up- and down-vote buttons). I&#x27;m a big believer in &quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke ...&quot; but also consider that a design should move with browser/web developments to, in an evolving way. Mind you dang seems to do a great job with the moderating.",1436043950

A great example is Grand Central Dispatch[1] which Apple open-sourced and has been since ported to FreeBSD. Another example is launchd, a replacement init system, that was open-sourced too.<p>Even if they didn&#x27;t do any of this though, it&#x27;s silly to treat proprietary software as if it doesn&#x27;t exist and doesn&#x27;t provide any benefit. Personally, I would be thrilled if Apple (or any other company) used any of my open-source work, even if they made a proprietary fork, because as a result I&#x27;d end up with a better OS. Yes, it would be even better if they stayed open-source and contributed back - but if that&#x27;s not going to happen, I&#x27;d rather software, whether open or proprietary, keeps on improving. If a proprietary fork is what it takes, so be it.<p>Some of my favourite and most useful software is proprietary but contains open-source libraries. If those libraries restricted the use to only open-source applications, and the developers were unwilling to open-source, those applications might not exist - or at least might not be as good. If that were the case, we&#x27;d all have lost out.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Dispatch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Dispatch</a>",1436043698

9831611,comment,9830232,9831351,0,0,analog31,,,"In my view the hard thing is sight-reading. With programming, if it takes one person twice as long as another, to read or write a program, at worst their productivity will be a bit lower. Or maybe higher. ;-) If you can&#x27;t read music at tempo, then there are certain kinds of work that you can&#x27;t do at all.<p>Granted, sight-reading skill is a matter of degree. I can read a jazz band gig, but would struggle with complex modern orchestral music. In musical styles that I&#x27;m familiar with, I can often make a good enough guess about what&#x27;s next, that I only have to focus my attention on the dangerous bits. My attention often wanders away from the page.<p>I used to think that sight-reading was something that had to be learned, starting at an early age. I don&#x27;t know if I still believe that, but I know that most adults who attempt to learn, find it to be prohibitive. This is one reason why it would be great to find an alternative. Even a piano with keys that light up.",1436043644

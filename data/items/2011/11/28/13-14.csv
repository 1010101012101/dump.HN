Your app is an unknown quantity, getting someone to spend <i>anything</i> on an unknown quantity is really really hard.<p>When you go to McDonald's (or anyone for that matter) do you get something different every time, or do you get your favorite thing? Same goes for Olive Garden or Cheesecake Factory, did you get the burger last time and the fresh fish catch this time?<p>Probably not.<p>To some degree, those fart apps are a known quantity; they make fart noises, so they have the advantage over your app of having their foot in the door for everyone interested.<p>It seems unfair, but there has to be a strategy there for riding that wave. Hollywood has always done it, did you enjoy Superman 7 or Harry Potter 14?<p>It doesn't matter, it was a known quantity and eleventeen million people went and saw it.<p>It seems like SJ is being forced to learn this lesson over-and-over again[2] and I've already shared my thoughts with you about that[3].<p>Your expectations of what you want SJ to do and exactly how you want it to do it may be too tight. You guys are clearly talented and I wonder if you need some step-back-and-get-a-better-perspective time.<p>Tom's comment[4] is a great example of what I mean.

3285844,comment,3284169,3284601,2,0,bane,,,"I had to finish up high school, and simply get out in the real world. I worked odd jobs, shitty manual labor and such for a bit. When that got old (or I got tired of being outside) I found a job doing tech support. After a couple years of that I came away with two things<p>a) I had trouble doing tech support initially because communicating effectively with people is hard. I learned more skills related to handling people during that job than I have anywhere else, and it's the most valuable skill I've ever learned.<p>b) I absolutely hated doing tech support. I applied for some other, better jobs, and couldn't get them. Doing support couldn't pay my bills, and I finally found myself in a situation where I knew that the best way forward for me was to just go to school and get it over with. I took a couple remedial classes at the local community college to get over my fears from K-12, simple things like Algebra. But I took those classes also to learn <i>how</i> to study. If learned to grind. And I also learned that even when I thought I knew something, I learned I hadn't mastered it. If a teacher assigned 20 problems, I'd do 40, and invariably I'd find one or two I couldn't solve, or had trouble with.<p>I had to teach myself work ethic. Tell myself I was working hard, not that I was smart. After all, if I was so smart I wouldn't be 4 years out of High School taking Algebra classes at a Community College would I?<p>I generally avoided distractions, I had friends I studied with, but I didn't put a whole lot into the relationships. I eventually found people who were also interested in studying and working hard and we became a regular study group throughout most of my undergrad. That helped satiate my desire for human interaction, without becoming a drag on my time or a distraction away from school. I met my wife through that group. But we got together knowing we'd support each other through our schooling and study. So it wasn't like the relationship was a huge distraction like it can often become. (We studied extra together instead of going on dates, cheaper and more useful in the long run).<p>It wasn't easy. I still have work ethic issues that crop up. But I know how to spot them and work on working them out. Turns out these days, working in a more managerial position, most of the work is mindless grindwork, filling out paperwork, attending meetings, that sort of thing. But if I hand't taught myself to do it, I never would have made it.<p>The thing is, I knew I was smart, so I considered everything I couldn't do, even grindwork, as something I <i>knew</i> I could figure out. I took everything as a challenge to my intellect, and that's seen me through pretty well.",1322488674

Business is 90% about knowing what is important and what is a waste of your time. When you're working 12 hour days and your business isn't becoming insanely successful it's pretty obvious that most of the hours you work are wasted. Hours burned and sacrificed with nothing to show for it.<p>If you've been working on unsuccessful startups it's easy to get into a sort of rhythm where you keep doing the same things that didn't work in the past, but only with more vigor. It's complete and utter madness to try to brute-force your way to success. It <i>can</i> work, of course, but the odds are stacked against you, and as a business person you should only play when the odds are highly in your favor.<p>My guess is that you've probably lost a bit of perspective if you've been punishing yourself like this for the past 4 years. Stop punishing yourself. You don't get rewarded for punishing yourself, and you shouldn't feel good (reward yourself) for working harder than is sustainable or harm your (mental) health. Reward yourself when you make good decisions, and punish yourself (if you have to) if you waste time on shit that doesn't matter.

It will help your linear algebra by strengthening your geometric intuitions, stuff like how to figure out if a plane intersects a sphere or if a line intersects a plane or SLERP are much are easier for the novice. You solve it algebraically but the objects you are reasoning with are geometric entities so you can't help but build your intuition on both.<p>Computationally though, they take more operations and elements (2^dim). And there is an order of magnitude difference in speed - 100x if implemented naively. But there are optimizations that can get it to 2x - 7x [1]. But apparently for full generality, 3D geometry is best done in a 5D conformal geometry which requires 32 element representations but I haven't gotten that far yet. You can make it more efficient by taking advantage of the sparseness of most structures and being able to scale up to more information as required by filling more indices. Something that cannot be handled as cleanly in standard vector based methods. Strangely this method of conformal geometry is covered by a Patent so commercial usage in the US requires licensing arrangements [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://staff.science.uva.nl/~fontijne/phd/fontijne_phd_compressed.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://staff.science.uva.nl/~fontijne/phd/fontijne_phd_compr...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.google.co.uk/patents?id=0CkWAAAAEBAJ&pg=PA7&dq=System+for+encoding+and+manipulating+models+of+object&hl=en&ei=RYbTTo6jK8LR8QOssMn9Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.co.uk/patents?id=0CkWAAAAEBAJ&pg=PA7&#...</a>",1322487831

That's why 'small increments' are key there: as you say, don't <i>significantly</i> change content.<p>Blizzard have always followed this philosophy with their game balance changes: they make very small changes each patch. They are so careful that often, the effect they are trying to achieve won't be hit until after several patches. See, for example, druid effectiveness in Player-versus-Player: it's steadily, but very slowly, decreased since The Burning Crusade, as a result of druids being (perceived?) too good at surviving.<p>I mostly kept my Android game's existing content the same. The only changes I made were to slightly decrease difficulty each patch, as some areas were definitely too hard (the first boss could take up to 10 tries to kill, no matter what you did :).<p>One thing that users really love though is the release of a large chunk of content in one patch - e.g. a brand new area to explore. I don't think this translates well to websites or webapps - no matter how much of a killer 'feature', users can be very cynical or underwhelmed.<p>Finally, in enterprise software development, you need to be very careful with rapid release cycles as corporations are very dependent on the stability of your product, even if it's internal.<p>Horses for courses.

In addition, I'm a big fan of The Singularity and believe that mankind is not going to stay the same biological construct. I experimented with various drugs in high school. I am a big believer of hacking my mind for optimum performance and I take a few nutritional supplements on a regular basis because of that. Finally, I have a sleep disorder and have both a prescription for various neuroenhancers and a traditional reason to use them. So I'm about as big of a poster boy as possible on the benefits of better living through modern chemistry.<p>But I must advise caution here. The main problem is that <i>your brain is not the thing to use to measure how your brain is doing.</i> It doesn't work. What we end up measuring instead is how good something makes us feel. For instance, Provigil is great stuff; it fulfills a role of addressing wakefulness. But it also makes a person feel really good.<p>I'd never support further legal restrictions, but I would most certainly caution folks to take a hard look at what you are doing. From what I see, once you start down this road you can never stop. Let's say you took your magic pills and aced your exam. Was it you, or was it you <i>with the pills</i>. Well, honestly, you don't know. Maybe you could have passed without the pills and maybe not. So now it's a few months later and time for the next exam. Do you take the pills again? I don't see how you couldn't -- why handicap yourself when you know the pills give you enhanced performance?<p>It just continues on like that -- more and more exams, job interviews, dates, parties -- life becomes a series of achievements. As you use neuroenhancers to accomplish each one, the natural conclusion is that you should take them again for the next one. The pattern builds up, and pretty soon you're telling yourself you'd be a fool to do X without the extra help. Note: I'm not trying to describe psychological addiction here. You may be perfectly able to physically quit at any time. What I'm saying is that you become <i>logically</i> addicted; that the most logical thing for you to do is to continue taking them. So now suddenly instead of a kid who took some speed back in college to ace an exam or two, you're the 30-something who has been taking pills on a regular basis for over a decade to change the way his brain works.

Your own could be ok depending on how you do it).<p>A startup will likely have stupid ideas about work ethic and they'll probably want to push your compensation into equity.  For any startup you join, be realistic, it will <i>not</i> be the next google/facebook.  You'll be doing well if it doesn't end up failing.  If it does survive, the equity you got will probably be devaluated somehow.<p>There may be some lottery-level chance of becoming financially independent, but you'll save yourself effort by just working a TPS-land job and buying actual lottery tickets.<p>A much more consistent approach would be to contract (or consult if you have the chance) and live frugally.  With this, you should be able to save up enough money to take a year off every few years.",1322485653

On that scale, all these tasks are embarassingly parallel. Exceptions to this are multiuser systems where users interactions matter, such as facebook, in which case a huge cluster is required. My argument is that more computing will devoted to the former (basically machine learning, and scientific/engineering optimization) than the latter (multi-user databases) over time, simply because humans can only enter so much info (all 7 billion of us) compared to what machines can gather and compute.",1322485542

But is this necessarily a good thing?<p>I see far too many students entering postsecondary education who shouldn't be there.  No matter how hard they try, they just can't grasp the basic concepts.  And when they inevitably fail, they fall back on what they were praised for as children -- ""but I worked so hard!"" -- as if they deserve to receive a degree on the basis of effort alone.<p>Sure, it's useful to remind smart kids that they need both brains and effort.  But don't make the dumb kids think that effort alone is enough to get them where they want to go.",1322485275

It also used a custom font on a bitmap display such to cram 80 characters on the screen. I don&#x27;t remember what it was called, but probably was downloaded from a random BBS. I pretty much never used it, because of the ugliness of it.<p>But, the 128 80 column mode was entirely usable (it was at 640x200 or 640x400 interlaced, so it was quite legible, and comparable to PC displays of the time). So, I was able to use PC BBSes comfortably from the 128, but not from the 64. I&#x27;d be happier, if more software took advantage of the 128. There aren&#x27;t even any music trackers for the 128, that I can find.",1450889952

However, I can say from that experience that I could not pay my school at that point. The collector owned the bill. They had paid the school for it, so the school had already gotten its money.\nBut there&#x27;s no HIPPA violation in sending a medical bill to collections, and making false accusations like that to get out of paying a legitimate bill (or getting a legitimately delinquent account removed from your credit report) is slimy at best.</i><p>One of the accepted methods here goes as follows: \nPay the Doctor&#x27;s Office.\nSend a letter saying you refuse them to share any information about the service provided. \nChallenge the debt collector through the credit reporting agency. \nCollector will then try to get the doctor&#x27;s office to confirm the debt, which they no longer have a compelling reason to. \nCA drops it off your report because collector can no longer confirm it.<p>Works almost all the time. There is no false HIPAA accusation here.<p><i>>B. Are you referring to items at collections? Then yes and no. Collection agencies will usually offer Pay-For-Delete if you ask for it in writing, in which case you pay the item and it&#x27;s removed from your report altogether. You still end up having to pay the bill. The alternative (if it&#x27;s a valid delinquency) is to let it sit for 7 years until it falls off.</i><p>Collection agencies do not like to pay-for-delete. They&#x27;ll say they&#x27;re legally bound to report exactly as it happened (also a lie). They will fight you on it if your debt isn&#x27;t significantly large enough that they&#x27;re making enough profit for it to be worth it. You can get them to do it, it will just take time and negotiating.<p><i>>A. This is only possible by virtue of having little to no actual credit history. If you&#x27;re in your 30&#x27;s with a mortgage, paid off student loans and paid off vehicles, you&#x27;re not going to make massive positive changes to your report in a year without major negative items falling off.</i><p>I had 12 delinquencies removed. They were of varying difficulty, all different collectors. Some were easy, some very, very hard. One in particular I had to go so far as to pull phone records from years ago. Any negative item falling off your report is huge. Even one small $100 delinquency hurts you a ton, regardless of your history.<p>The only thing I didn&#x27;t deal with was credit card debt.

The only part they underplayed is they made it sound like the startup &quot;stumbled.&quot; No, it sounds like it went exactly as planned. Blackberry got the acquisitions, investors got their money, execs got their bonuses, and the rank-and-file got nothing. That isn&#x27;t stumbling, that&#x27;s the playbook.<p>Tech employees need to wake up about common vs preferred shares, and that the former are worthless. They are NOT worthless because they are &quot;lottery tickets&quot; and most startups fail. They are worthless because they are designed, as a financial instrument, to be fake equity with no real protection from dilution and liquidation preference.<p>The most insulting aspect of common shares is that engineers get talked into pay cuts on the premise that they get these options, essentially being asked to invest a portion of their potential compensation into the company, but are then told they don&#x27;t deserve to be given real equity because they aren&#x27;t &quot;real&quot; investors.<p>I understand that from a founder&#x27;s perspective, asking someone to give you millions of dollars is significantly more challenging than asking someone to take a 30% pay cut, so it&#x27;s easy to give strong preference to the former. But, supposedly and debatably, it&#x27;s also difficult to recruit talent, and it&#x27;s going to be significantly more difficult as employees increasingly realize that Common ISO&#x27;s aren&#x27;t &quot;lottery tickets&quot; they are &quot;toilet paper&quot;. So either startups are going to have to re-invent these equity packages, or the talent will flock away from the VC companies and towards companies that can pay salary. Of course, the VCs have a huge playbook to flood the market with more talent to (taking $100 mil taxpayer money to fund the same bootcamps they invest in to work for the same companies they hire via Obama&#x27;s tech talent shortage program, for example), so who knows.",1450889481

They did this to try and optimize for long-term capital gains.<p>For most employees who leave their option grants as options, there is nothing to worry about.<p>When you are given a grant of stock options, you can sometimes ask the company to let you exercise it early, and vest the shares instead of the options.  If you do this when the fair market value (FMV) of the underlying stock is the same as when the options are granted, you will not be in a precarious tax situation.  However, many people wait a couple years before deciding to exercise their options, and as a result, they need to recognize a paper gain when they exercise later as the FMV is substantially higher.  That&#x27;s what happened here.  They exercised later, thinking the stock price would go even higher, and they were wrong, but they had to pay taxes on that higher price.<p>While it&#x27;s true they paid a lot of extra taxes, since they never recognized the gains, they can roll that tax credit forward to cover future gains they may get at some other point in the future.  I&#x27;m not sure how long you can roll these losses forward, but I think it&#x27;s for a substantial period of time.",1450888208

10784032,comment,10782855,10783468,0,0,epidemian,,,"I agree in that easy parsing is a good quality of languages. But i also think a language can have a rather rich (i.e. big) syntax that&#x27;s also straightforward to parse. That is, that the dichotomy of either having a very lean syntax like Scheme or a bloated and complicated syntax like Ruby is not so clear-cut.<p>The difficulty of parsing Ruby&#x27;s syntax (both for machines and for humans) comes from some unfortunate design decisions, not so much from its vastness. For example, using the same symbols, {}, to denote hash literals and blocks makes parsing/understanding the syntax of method calls more difficult:<p><pre><code>  def foo(*args)\n    puts &quot;args: #{args}, block_given?: #{block_given?}&quot;\n  end\n  # Parentheses can be omitted when calling methods:\n  foo           # args: [], block_given?: false\n  foo 42        # args: [42], block_given?: false\n  foo 42, &quot;bar&quot; # args: [42, &quot;bar&quot;], block_given?: false\n  # *Except* when the first argument is a hash. This:\n  foo({})       # args: [{}], block_given?: false\n  # Means something completely different than this:\n  foo {}        # args: [], block_given?: true\n  # But if the hash is not the first argument then it&#x27;s OK, you can omit parens\n  # again :3\n  foo 42, {}    # args: [42, {}], block_given?: false\n</code></pre>\nThis is not a problem of having dedicated syntax for blocks and hash literals. It&#x27;s a problem of having chosen conflicting syntactic forms for them. If blocks could only be denoted with do/end, or with a different set of symbols than hash literals, this would not be a problem.<p>And this is just one example of conflicting syntactic forms. In Ruby, sadly, there many cases of this. E.g., using * both for multiplication and for argument &quot;splatting&quot; means that<p><pre><code>  a * b\n</code></pre>\nis not the same as<p><pre><code>  a *b\n</code></pre>\nwhen `a` is a method, but actually <i>is</i> the same when `a` is a local variable; or `foo &quot;bar&quot;` and `foo&quot;bar&quot;` being two perfectly valid ways of calling foo with &quot;bar&quot; as an argument, but `foo [42]` and `foo[42]` <i>not</i> being two perfectly valid ways of calling foo with [42] as an argument; and probably more.<p>So, as long as syntactic forms are carefully chosen so that they don&#x27;t have weird and conflicting edge cases between each other, i think a language can have a rather big syntax without it being difficult to parse/understand.<p>Disclaimer: i love Ruby; it&#x27;s my bread-and-butter language. But i wish it didn&#x27;t have as many syntax quirks as it does :)",1450888069

Would people have tried Google if they had to pay $10 per month to access it?? This is a tax on innovation. The innovation from big players doesn&#x27;t get taxed while a founder would need to innovate 100x instead of the current 10x to make people move. Founders have limited resources. Creating 100x innovation will take a lot more time than getting people to move to 10x innovation, making some money and innovating further. What do you think this would do to the angels in India who have recently started investing in startups rather than gold/land/stocks? They would go back to land/stocks.<p>> Only if Facebook is the only ISP, which could only happen if government passed a law or regulation that made that so.<p>Facebook intends to use data services (3g,4g) to deploy its free basics.

If those sources are corrupt, lets not add another corrupt source into the mix.<p>>Not, it isn&#x27;t. It would be more innovative if it was forced to compete with Facebook.<p>Really? There was a time in India when you had to be REALLY REALLY REALLY innovative (in many different ways) to merely get a license to start a business from the govt. We called it &#x27;license raj&#x27;. You know what it did. It killed all the innovation. You have to let smallest of innovations thrive for them to grow into bigger ones!!<p>>Now you just have to pay expensive prices even if you just want to chat with your friends.<p>Better than the possibility of being stuck with that same &#x27;chat&#x27; for the next 20 years. India needs jobs more than &#x27;free chat&#x27;. Jobs will come from Indian companies. And Indian companies cannot thrive unless the field is even. Plus, its not about Indian vs Foreign.

Blue Origin&#x27;s New Shepard, the best I can tell was traveling at ~0 km/h at that height, as it reached apogee at the height of 100.5 km and began falling back to Earth.<p>According to Musk[0], a first stage of a rocket is judged by the energy it can impart to its payload at the standardized height of 100 km. Merely getting to 100 km is the easy part. The Falcon 9 is able to deliver 120 giga-joules to its payload at the height of 100 km, while performing a return to launch site landing.

When you&#x27;re actually in heavy Objective-C land with method calls in tight loops, performance is pretty bad, both because message sending is slow and because methods can&#x27;t be devirtualized. Apple knows this, and they&#x27;ve basically reached the limit of what they can do without incompatible changes to the Objective-C semantics. Hence the performance-related design decisions in Swift.<p>(As for UIScrollView/UITableView, I agree that they&#x27;re very fast relative to Android or current Web browsers for example.

A compulsively readable play about an episode in the politics of West Germany in the 1970s, a subject I didn&#x27;t know could be made so interesting to me. Superb.<p>Michael Flynn, Eifelheim. Excellent and profound SF/historical novel about aliens crashing in the Germany of the Middle Ages, and how that would work out. Avoids cheap tricks, very strong on historical research and verisimilitude.<p>Ross Thomas, The Cold War Swap, Cast a Yellow Shadow, Chinaman&#x27;s Chance. Very well-written thrillers, typically stories about spying or political corruption. I&#x27;m usually bored by this genre, couldn&#x27;t put these down.

(reread) Very inventive and weird in a good way, but I wish the characters would be a little different (everyone is the same highly neurotic mouthpiece for the author), and the obsession with I Ching does nothing for me. Still worth reading.<p>Robert Ryan, Dead Man&#x27;s Land. A Sherlock Holmes novel in which 90% of the action is with John Watson rejoining the Army to help in World War I at his late middle age, and Holmes appears only briefly. Works quite well. Very detailed on day-to-day trench warfare and medicine at the front.<p>Michael Frayn, Noises Off. A funny short play, very meta, not as good as his &quot;Democracy&quot;.<p>Neil Gaiman, The Ocean at the End of the Lane. Better than his two long novels of the 2000s. A self-contained fairy tale, fun to read and well-written, but not beyond that. Gaiman&#x27;s unsurpassed masterpiece, to me, is still The Sandman.<p>Michael Swansick, Chasing the Phoenix.

A brilliant memoir by a neurosurgeon about his work, the nature of his profession, successes and mistakes (especially the latter). Frequently touches or verges into the personal. Not morbid, but often sad.<p>Keith Johnstone, <i>Impro for Storytellers</i>. \nViola Spolin, <i>Improvisation for the Theater</i><p>Two very good books about improvisation, although Spolin&#x27;s is too dry and theory-laden for me (it&#x27;s meant for teachers more than practitioners). Both, however, pale compared to Keith Johnstone&#x27;s earlier Impro: Improvisation and the Theater, which is a life-changing book about what improvisation can teach us about spontaneous creativity and relationships between people. I recommend that one first and foremost if you know nothing about improvisation and are curious.<p>Martinus J G Veltman, <i>Facts and Mysteries in Elementary Particle Physics</i>. A readable account - necessarily simplified, of course - of the current state of affairs in elementary particles and much of the last 50 years of history, by one of the participants (a Nobel prize winner). Not as organized and methodical as I thought it would be, and half a year later I forgot most of the physical explanations, but it was an interesting read.<p>Robert B. Edgerton, <i>Sick Societies</i>. A thorough examination of the hundreds of horrible examples when &quot;natural&quot; societies studied by anthropologists have customs that are not only bad from our modern Western point of view, but arguably fail in achieving their own objectives. The whole book exists to counter lazy cultural relativism of the &quot;maybe we don&#x27;t like X, but if they do it, it must be for a good reason and it must be a useful adaptation for them&quot; kind.<p>Michael Harris, <i>Mathematics Without Apologies</i>. A very eclectic and idiosyncratic book by a mathematician on the sociology and epistemology of mathematics as a discipline. To be appreciated for its wealth of ideas and references to other interesting books and theories, rather than for any particular argument or thread.<p>Milton Rokeach, <i>The Three Christs of Ypsilanti</i>. A story on what happened when a psychologist tried to bring three psychiatric patients, each believing themselves to be Christ, together and to talk it out amongst themselves. Happened in the 1960s. The idea is more interesting than the outcome.<p>Fiction, best to worst:<p>Patrick O&#x27;Brian, <i>The Hundred Days</i>. The penultimate book in the series of the best historical novels (the Aubrey-Maturin series) ever written, by a huge margin. The series transcend the genre and I count the Aubrey-Maturin books among the very best books I read in the last decade.<p>Dodie Smith, <i>I Capture the Castle</i>. A brilliantly written coming-of-age story about a girl growing up in an impoverished family occupying a decaying castle in the English countryside, set in the 1930s. Reminded me in many ways of Rebecca West&#x27;s The Fountain Overflows, a novel in the similar genre (but with a younger protagonist) that&#x27;s known much less than it deserves.<p>Juan Rulfo, <i>Pedro Paramo</i>. If you read and liked Garcia Marquez&#x27;s A Hundred Years of Solitude, this one is shorter, darker, involves many more dead people, and you may want to give it a try.<p>Alfred Hayes, <i>In Love</i>. A story of a man obsessed by love in a mid-century NYC. Unexpectedly touching, very convincing psychologically.<p>Iain M. Banks, <i>Against a Dark Background</i>. SF, a grand heist novel set in a advanced civilization living in a star system located unimaginably far away from any other stars and galaxies, and so doomed to a lone struggle with its own long history. A wealth of technological and social ideas you&#x27;d expect from Banks. The ending felt a bit forced.<p>Gene Wolfe, <i>There Are Doors</i>. Gene Wolfe, <i>Nightsite of the Long Sun/Lake of the Long Sun</i>.<p>Gene Wolfe is the best writer American science fiction produced in the last half-century. &quot;There are Doors&quot; is a pretty weird fantasy novel about an alternate world where men die after their first intercourse (as some spiders do in ours), and the hero travels back and forth between that world and ours. It&#x27;s good, but not as strong as Wolfe&#x27;s best, which to my taste is the Book of the New Sun tetralogy, the novellas in the Fifth Head of Cerberus collection, and many of his short stories (well-collected in The Best of Gene Wolfe). The other two are the first half of the &quot;Book of the Long Sun&quot; series that I&#x27;m still reading through.<p>Ursula K. Le Guin, <i>The Dispossessed</i>. Superb political SF about an imagined anarchist [anti-]utopia. A serious attempt to describe a human society with no central power structures and no ownership. The hero is a physicist born and raised in that society who escapes to a sibling planet with the more typical modern states. This novel took all the awards in the 1970s when it was published, and deservedly so.<p>[cont&#x27;d]",1450886818

Every couple of weeks I&#x27;ll hit a point in one of the books where I&#x27;ll just read the rest of it in a couple hours. Of course these numbers all depend on the books - this year did not include anything longer than 500 pages.<p>Also, don&#x27;t get too hung up on the numbers. The past couple months were hectic and my pace has really slowed down, and that&#x27;s totally fine.",1450886442

On one hand, that made it very accessible as long as you knew a few terms like &quot;sum&quot;. On the other hand, the reader has to build a relatively small mental model out of a <i>lot</i> of words.<p>Is it better to concentrate hard on a system of equations taking 1/4 of a page (with lots of whitespace) until you grok it, or read five pages of prose at fairly normal speed and try to build a mental model of it? Which better confers the ability to quickly come to the realization of something like &quot;that&#x27;s a parabola&quot; or &quot;the minimum of that function is obviously seven&quot; or whatever?<p>Analogies are only so useful, but I think there are enough parallels there to shed some light.",1450886416

In any case they are paying for mobile towers; I am just saying that the incremental cost of providing full internet access is not very large. But you are right my figures are wrong.",1450886403

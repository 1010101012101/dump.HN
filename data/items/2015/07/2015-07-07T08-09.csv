I agree about removing the free plan, i&#x27;d have 3 plans, 1 at $35 for the mom and pops, one at $99 for your main bread and butter and then one at $499 a month for enterprise, where you offer premium phone support, training, and other general perks that enterprises love.<p>Give a 30 day free trial of the $99 plan and then make them pay after that.

When you buy steel from a mill, you usually get it in plates or sections. These will be stamped with a Heat Number which links it back to the conditions under which it was made; the chemical ladle analysis and properties to meet a particular specification. These then undergo visual, non-destructive and destructive testing to verify everything is acceptable.<p>A third party / independent  verification body (or IVB) will also confirm this by basically shadowing every step of the way and confirming everything is legit; right from the internal processes and systems of the company down to the certification of testing equipment involved and witnessing the tests.<p>If this is the case and everything lines up you will get something like an EN 10204 3.2 cert with your plate/section.<p>Then to maintain tracability from plate to part, there are standard processes and requirements (either industry standard, or client imposed) which then help maintain a chain of custody as it were.<p>I would hazard a guess that it&#x27;s similar for ceramics.",1436258949

Yes, it makes sense to look at Google as primarily an ad company in some contexts--for instance, attempting to understand their business model. In other senses, Google has done a lot to distance themselves from being just an ad company, diversifying in image, product, talent, markets, and company culture. Probably more, but I don&#x27;t know too much about the intricacies of what Google actually innovated on. Just by doing this, yes, I do think it is inherently dishonest to group them with other entities that do just resell web space. And I do not think that Google would cease to exist if people boycotted advertised products tomorrow, either, because their grasp of tech culture is so strong. People will always need analytics, retargeting, and profiling, so reducing an entire company to advertisers is downright insulting. Just the competition to ios alone has irreversibly changed the future of smartphones, mostly for the better.<p>Hell, just the market value of Google&#x27;s brand is enough to distinguish them.

As the article states, in most countries everything is already covered by existing legislation (and society&#x27;s general view of common decency but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily help in a court).<p>The problem is one of implementation. How do you gather proof/evidence, how do you prove <i>intent</i> beyond reasonable doubt, and how do you support the victims during and after. A fair amount of the existing problem is similar to bullying in other area: the victims being scared to speak out either just through fear of the perpetrators or through the thought that nothing can and/or will be done. And other key problem is people in law enforcement (from the cops on the street all the way up to the judges and legislators) and people in society&#x27;s support structures (parents, teachers, councillors, and so forth) not understanding: being out of touch with the technology, or facets of modern culture (cyber-bullying is a lot more common in the young and many who where young 20 or more years ago, and I&#x27;m including myself there, don&#x27;t quite understand those people), or often both.<p>Sometimes the more specific a crime the easier it is for a good legal team (or just a clever arsehole) to find loopholes that allow them to get away with things that are effectively the same thing but are not covered by the exact wording, so great care needs to be taken in drafting the law.<p>Having said that: making it a specific crime might be a very useful stop-gap measure though. It at least tells both the victims and those on the other side that the situation is being taken seriously, brings the matter to sharper focus for the implementers/enforcers of the law so they&#x27;ll see the need to fill the knowledge/experience gap, and to an extent brings the issue to increased public attention (hopefully with similar effect where needed).",1436257888

You might as well complain that Indians use the word &quot;flat&quot; instead of &quot;Apartment&quot; and use &quot;colour&quot; and &quot;centre&quot;. By the way, two specific points against the article are merely literal translations of equivalent expressions in Indian languages, similar phrases will exist with other people for whom English is a second language:<p>1) &quot;Do one thing&quot; is a literal translation of &quot;ek kaam karo&quot;, which is a valid Hindi expression. The ideal English idiom in the same spirit as the Hindi one would be &quot;Try this:&quot;, which is perfectly reasonable.<p>2) &quot;Sleep is coming&quot; is a literal translation of &quot;neend aa rahi hai&quot;, again which is valid Hindi.<p>One usage which is common to Indians, and cause confusion to even other Indians: does a student of a course &quot;take an exam&quot; or &quot;give an exam&quot;?

The biggest issues with cyber bullying are with kids and teenagers, not trolls.  I doubt kids have the foresight to care, and even then they&#x27;re also (rightfully) treated differently by court systems, meaning that they know there are much lessened punishments even if it is brought up.",1436256917

A few reasons:<p>1. It follows the mentality of guided discovery. Topics are covered in class, and just enough is taught such that the basis of a solution can be formed, but the implementation requires each person to discover something new.<p>2. The breadth of topics. The course is 50% students who have never programmed before, I have been programming for 4 years, but still I am learning new things about optimizations, tail recursion, and Big-O notation. If you look at the calendar at <a href=""http://cs61.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs61.org</a>, it goes from &quot;these are variables&quot; to &quot;AI&quot; in 8 weeks.<p>3. Resources. CS 61A Staff during the summer course if legendary already. They&#x27;re extremely knowledgeable and very welcoming to everyone. The main lecturers, Albert and Robert, both cover the material well and make themselves available to students of any programming knowledge. There are also dozens and dozens of TAs and Lab assistants which are actually useful, unlike some other courses.<p>4. Intrigue. I have never wanted to bunker down and learn everything there is to know about recursion, interpreters, and algorithms more than I have in the last two weeks. The way the course is structured, as mentioned above, actually inspires learning in a way that some other topics don&#x27;t achieve because they follow archaic teaching methods.<p>Here&#x27;s to an awesome 61A course.",1436256379

Essentially, females prefer males that invest in their relationship because they are more likely to remain in the relationship.  This same phenomenon can be found in all sorts of things, such as law offices (why are they so fancy?!).<p>A great general model on this can be found here (pdf):

I came to Berkeley as an international student without having the opportunity to visit and things turned out just fine, but in retrospect I'd have loved the opportunity to get to know the area beforehand.<p>As others have said, most students at either Berkeley or Stanford don't live in SF. Staying there makes sense as a tourist though, both are easily accessible through day trips and you get to enjoy SF.<p>If you do visit Berkeley, a great way to get a feel for it is to sit in on classes. You can see this semester's CS classes here <a href=""http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule.html</a>.

2185145,comment,2185100,2185100,0,0,TimothyBurgess,,,"The only problem I have with this... is that I've experienced firsthand the other side of this coin.  For a few years I was surrounded by a few people who have a knack for getting money... by any means necessary.  These people would lie (not little white lies, big ones with negative impacts), manipulate, and straight-up steal from others just to make a few bucks.  They had no remorse for the detrimental outcomes they brought upon those they stole from... no compassion whatsoever.<p>When looking for those with a knack for getting money, look for those who earn it... those whose ethics are no less than admirable... unless of course you lack compassion and morals yourself.  Those who manipulate and steal without any remorse for others' lives need to be weeded out.  They drag the rest of us down and hold us back for their own selfish gain.<p>Some may consider this darwinism - survival of the fittest - but I believe we've made much more progress as a species by working with each other than against.<p>The last conversation I had with these people I spent years with was to try to explain how their line of thinking quite honestly brings suffering to countless people.  Prime example, big banks making deals they know will fall through regardless of the impact it has on the economy... look where we are now.  The type of people who made the decisions that led to the recent recession, which caused a massive decrease in my father's hours at work, are the same ones who want to perform a shortsale on his house because he has fallen behind on his mortgage.  As for the suffering I mentioned, let's just say my father will give up his house over his dead body.",1296973979

The idea is: There are a lot of new developments in machine learning and NLP that have immediate applications in industry, but that you've never heard of yet. I walked through these ideas in a high-level way and gave a lot of intuition.<p>It was my first talk in industry, but based upon the rating assigned by conference goers (4.26 out of 5 stars), it appears it was one of the top five sessions in the entire conference. I guess I'll have to wait until the voting is closed to know for sure.<p>The video was recorded by O'Reilly, but is now behind a paywall.

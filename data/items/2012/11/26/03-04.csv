4830403,comment,4828724,4830223,2,0,ekianjo,,,"Both are difficult, but at least in programming you can rely on manipulating actual ""elements"" of information. There is some tangible part in it, while sometimes very remote in certain cases. Abstract Mathematics go into spaces of n dimensions and stuff that most programmers would not be able to comprehend, just like most human beings cannot without tremedous time and effort.<p>I think it is a false debate to say that one discipline is poorer or more valuable than the other. We need both Mathematicians to advance the theories and Programmers to apply their learnings into the real world. Everyone has its place.",1353902307
4830402,comment,4829763,4830285,1,0,DanBC,,,"Vulnerable people in England get some protection.  One form of that protection is provided by local government Social Services.  (Each scheme has a different name because they're provided by different regional authorities.  And this one I'm talking about is obsolete.)<p>MARMAP - multi agency risk management & assessment panel is a group of the people involved in the care and treatment of a vulnerable person who is at high risk of harming themselves or other people.<p>Let's make a hypothetical patient, and call him Bob.<p>Bob has a GP.  Bob has a care coordinator.  Bob has a consultant psychiatrist for outpatient care.  Bob has a consultant psychiatrist for inpatient mental health hospital care.  Bob has a community treatment team.  Bob has a community psychotherapist. Bob has a crisis team.<p>This is about ten people just for the mental health stuff.  I can tell you now that these people do not agree about the best way forward for Bob.  Even though they're all in the same room as Bob, and they all get minutes of the meetings, one doctor will call Bob non-compliant when Bob follows the conflicting advice of another doctor.  (EG: The in-patient consultant tells Bob to avoid going to hospital.  The out-patient team admits Bob, against his will.  Bob is called manipulative by the in-patient doctor.)<p>This is a lousy situation. Even though clinicians are talking face to face with each other communication gets garbled.  Imagine the problem when communication goes from a nurse observing Bob to one doctor, through their juniors, to a secretary, to another team (sometimes using weird technology such as fax machines) through to a team leader, to a team member.  (""Interface Problems"") And this is within the same organisation.  Moving data from the MH trust to a different medical trust is tricky, and to social services or law enforcement is even trickier.<p>Getting more people involved causes problems, and that's when the people are in the same specialism and broadly agree on modes of treatment.  Getting more people involved when those people have fundamentally different opinions about treatment is going to distract them from providing good treatment as they focus on debunking stuff that's useless but has vigorous advocates.",1353902305

Being open source doesn't fundamentally change things in the sense that it's not like my grandmom is going to say, ""Ahh... this is file format IEEE-12312.  Let me write a quick viewer optimized for my concerns.""<p>I suspect the author thinks there would be a rich ecosystem of tools for an open source file format, but in something as specialized as medical records I don't think the non-technical user would do much better.  Viewing your vaccination history is much different than identifying sepsis vs trying to diagnose MS in the brain vs cancer vs high blood pressure.

I used RoR for my start-up because I was sick of PHP and wanted to learn Rails, and I feel immensely more productive now than I did when I began. And I'm a ""quick learner"", too.<p>Familiarity with Active Record, and making it reasonably performant, handling rails security issues, experience with the gem ecosystem, understanding the intricacies of the routing DSL, getting a handle on reasonable rspec/capybara or cucumber practices, ruby metaprogramming, knowing the Rails conventions and what it looks for automatically in controllers, views, and partials, and which methods are available where, knowing all the various helper methods rails provides for text processing, working with dates, and html tags, best practices integrating with AJAX, migrations, rack middleware, the asset pipeline, etc, etc. I've been working on our Rails app non-stop for 9 months now and every day I learn new stuff.<p>Long story short, for a start up which needs to iterate <i>fast</i> before it dies, acclimating a competent programmer to the ""Rails Way of Life"" just might not be worth it. Now, it's a completely different story if you have important domain specific knowledge, and the company is working on something especially innovative, but it seems like a lot of start-ups are scrambling for a pretty low-tech piece of the pie where ""execution wins"". My point is, Rails is surprisingly <i>big</i>, and while you can become <i>useful</i> in a matter of weeks, you can't become <i>extremely productive</i> with it for awhile longer.",1353901896

If writers were to describe man-made sources of radiation as being the result of fallout from weapons testing or dispersal of waste material from a nuclear accident, readers would panic regardless of the details.<p>I would prefer reporting to distinguish between sources.  Firstly, as people may mistakenly believe that all background radiation is natural without realizing that man-made sources are contributing to overall levels.  Secondly, as radioactive isotopes affect the human body differently when ingested or inhaled, people should be aware of the different health risks from man-made sources. For example, Sr-90 is linked to bone cancer and leukemia, Cesium-137 concentrates in muscle tissue, while I-131 collects in the thyroid.<p>I wish there was more accurate reporting, with limits and parameters as you mention, but it seems problematic as the science is complicated, physicists are not physicians, journalists are neither, and vested interests are at play.<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2012/05/29/should-we-hide-low-dose-radiation-exposures-from-the-public/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2012/05/29/should-we...</a>",1353900103

Filtering e-mail in this case is like putting your fingers in your ears when you walk by a loud stereo you've left on instead of just turning it off. As a developer, cron doesn't give me a lot of control over where e-mail is sent unless I jump through hoops to give myself that control. Ignoring the complexity of the reports, and the fact that filters like that don't easily scale across different recipients, the fact is that cron's e-mail capability is extremely coarse-grained. For every run of every job, the entire output is e-mailed out to the address specified in the crontab. This gets very unwieldy.<p>I've had to write cron table entries with a blank mail recipient in the crontab itself, and handle the specific mailing cases in the job script. This sucks. I'm not sure I think the solution is something that reads cron-mail and automatically generates filters, but I would very much like it if cron supported e-mail lists based on return codes or something else like that.",1353899692

Even if you change it to 3, people still won't know how to change it or <i>even that it can be changed</i>.<p>Now ""3"" just seems like an arbitrary decision.  Why 3?  Why not 2 or 4 or 5?<p>Instead, I might take the fact that everyone here on HN mentioned it* as a signal that they're (1) anxious to change it and (2) can't find a way to relieve that anxiety.<p>(2) is happening because the attention is (rightly) focused on the typing bit of the screen.<p>What if there were a slider from 1 to, say, 5 right below the the typing area?  It'd be easy to ignore but users would notice it as soon as they felt anxious about changing the number of words.<p>If you made it tie in dynamically with the value at the bottom of the page, it might also be an opportunity to ""teach"" your user to look at the bottom of the page for more advanced configuration options.  Better yet: have a smaller version of the slider down there and connect the two.  Then there would be literal movement to draw the users' attention to the bottom section of the page.<p>Other design nit: the top bar representing time and the bottom bar representing position shouldn't both be skinny orange lines.  I realize the bottom bar is slightly thicker, but it still implies a connection where there isn't one.<p>A small non-orange triangle pointing up would be a good icon for the bottom bar, indicating ""you are HERE.""  When a user makes an error, the triangle could advance and in addition to the letter turning red, it cloud leave a tiny red ""X"" on the same line as the triangle beneath the mistyped letter.<p>*: With the huge caveat that people on HN are lousy whiners and typically can't see the forest for the trees.

The strict program can be viewed as a series of commands, each modifying the state of the program. For example, consider the following code:\nint double(int x){\nint ans=x;\nans=ans<i>2;\nreturn ans;\n}\nThe above code can be viewed as:\nInput state | execute(ans=x) | execute(ans=2</i>x) | execute(return ans)\nwhere execute takes as an input both the state of the program, and a command. (As an aside, this is the approach of piping a state variable across functions is how Haskell handles IO)<p>The above code can also be viewed as:\nInput | A(x) | B(x) | C(x)<p>Evaluating this lazily will get you:\nC . B . A . Input<p>What the program wants to return is the final output of C. When the program tries to return C, it will go down the chain of expressions it must evaluate until it reaches one that it can, in this case A(Input). Once A(Input) is calculated, we no longer need Input it memory, so it can be garbage collected. At this point, the program is:\nC . B . Input'\nBecause Input' is the same size in memory as Input, we are, at this point, using no more memory than the strict version of the program. We can continue this argument until we eventually arrive at the final state, in which we have our answer.<p>With this, we can see that any strictly evaluated program can be done lazily with no more than twice the memory requirements (there is a point where we need both Input, and Input'), which from an asymptotic standpoint is equvilent.",1353899207

There is no narrowing of discourse in society if creepshots gets shut down.<p>There are free speech issues at play here, but I think they have more to do with balancing people's need for privacy versus the right of people to make and share media of things that happen in public.<p>(That said, a lot of images in those communities are just stolen from other people's Facebook streams anyway, so it's also an issue of privacy.)",1350629916

4672559,comment,4672057,4672307,7,0,lnanek2,,,"I worked for a CEO once (Saeju Jeong from Noom) who told me early on that being a good business man was all about being a good host and a nice person. Actually working for him: he frequently didn't pay me some months, paid too little other months, stopped paying benefits like gym membership so I had to take over, promised to do important paperwork and then never did it because he hated paying the accountant and wanted to micro-manage every hourly charge. He was pretty much the cruelest boss imaginable, even though he put on a happy face and said nice things.<p>If you'd approach him about these things he'd say the nicest things imaginable. I still have dozens of emails about him going to fix the payment issues, going to work on paying the benefits like the gym membership again, promising to do the paperwork I needed for my wife's immigration - how all these things were important to him. You really had to push hard to actually get anything done, though. After countless emails once we made a meeting to try to work on some of these issues, but he wouldn't hold it at his desk where we could actually trigger payments like I asked, instead he insisted it be in a meeting room where he made it all about how I didn't respect him and how we had to have a happier office.<p>So anyway, he was always trying to setup a good relationship and happy office. Good being where everyone said super nice things, but he cheated the hell out of you in practice. It's easy to talk super nice things, and then just never follow through when it actually costs you. I guess that counts as small ways, but I'm just trying to explain people can be super nice to your face always, but still be crooks.",1350629601

Blacklisting the number can be both ineffective and harmful.<p>Letting the caller set the caller ID is the only way someone calling you from Comcast about your bill can have Comcast show up on the ID. Most large companies like that don't own the numbers they call from, or the call centers -- they outsource both inbound and outbound phone support and sales. Typically to multiple phone center companies at the same time, who all have to call ""as"" Comcast, and ramp up or scale down with more or less phone numbers as needed.

Perhaps this could be seen as a feature.<p>- Namespacing - to cover all of the features of HTML you'll likely have to have quite a few functions declared and there is potential for an inadvertent overwrite. ex. var VIDEO = function() { return ""Ooops, I just killed my video elements""; }  On top of it there is risk of not being backwards compatible with older created templates as the HTML spec progresses and new functions need to be added.

It was written by me, came from my work email account (saumil.mehta AT getlocbox.com, in case you care to know), was sent 1-1 not en masse (you can check the headers) and was in no way intended to get anyone ticked off.<p>Secondly, yes. I've emailed well over 100 people personally in the last 15 days. A bunch of the emails have had very similar body copy so that is also accurate. I read Hacker News a decent bit and always search around for folks doing frontend work by using the search box and if I like their submissions/comments and sometimes if I just find their username intriguing or entertaining I poke around for their bio for their email and send them the note you see above. I do it nights and weekends after my ""day job"".<p>Thirdly, I work at and run a venture-backed company in San Francisco. It's the best job I've ever had and as everyone knows, learning from and working with good folks is paramount. It is also challenging to connect w/ the same folks.<p>With that backdrop set, I will admit freely that I like to ask for help. A lot. I ask lots of people. I cold email a lot of people. I do it with potential customers, potential partners, potential investors, potential folks that might be interested in contracting w/ us or joining our team. I always do it respectfully IMHO. Hell, I've even done it to Patrick Vlaskovits who was kind enough to respond in my stead on this page (hey Patrick!).<p>The outreach I discuss above has actually been excellent. It has yielded lots of fun conversations over email and Skype and several great phone and in-person conversations with folks in the community. I used to be a (decent but never great) developer. I love shooting the shit w/ other developers. A lot of it goes nowhere because most folks are busy at their day jobs or startups or are booked for contracts or don't care to work w/ us after talking w/ us. Some of it has resulted in freelancing contracts that has really helped my startup. That's all par for the course but a great investment of my time and (hopefully) anyone that takes time out of their busy day to talk to me.<p>In case you care, the response rate that I tabulated manually in my Google Apps account has been well north of 25%. That tells me that folks are, generally speaking, happy to talk to me and that I'm not wasting their time or trying to sell them timeshares.<p>I have had exactly 2 people tell me to go take a hike over email. That's ok too. When it happens I always apologize for the inconvenience and move on. But by and large the Hacker News community has been fantastic to connect with and learn from.<p>Lastly, a philosophical point. We all know startups are hard and millions of dollars of funding does nothing to change that. The only way to hack it after being at it for 18 months, I've found, is to ask for help very proactively, even of folks I don't know. It has stood me in great stead in every endeavor - fundraising, contracts, partnerships, customers, office space leasing, personal sanity maintenance, you name it. I hope you will agree and if you don't, feel free to email me or call me at (415) 322-9308 and flame me over the phone in the middle of my work day :)<p>Thanks all and good night!",1350626467

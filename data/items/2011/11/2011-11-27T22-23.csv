3283655,comment,3282944,3283184,-3,0,jackfoxy,,,"I don't have the reference for this, but I recall the seals between shuttle booster segments were originally engineered to use asbestos, not rubber as the gasket. The engineery qualities of asbestos for this purpose were perfectly understood, lower tempature lift-offs would not have been an issue, and most importantly, all the expensive live testing had already been performed when higher-ups recognized how politically incorrect asbestos was, even though a program as high-tech as the shuttle program was perfectly capable of handling asbestos perfectly safely. There probably was no $1M engineering fee that would have ever fixed this, because the multi-$M live fire tests were complete. No one considered this relatively minor engineering change (after all, the seal was redesigned to work with rubber) worthy of another round of very expensive tests (which primarily focused on the motor).<p>In a similar fashion (sorry, also doing this from memory, no reference) sometime in the late 80s or early 90s the main fuel tank insulation was switched-out because foam manufactured with CFC became verboten, so another material, with apparently unknown (or not completely desireable) engineering characteristics, was swapped in. I never recall hearing about ice ripping off big chuncks of fuel tank foam during the boost phase in the 80s. I only remember hearing about this starting in the 90s (or at least after the Challenger accident).<p>This is certainly tangential to the OP, except that there probably was copious high-priced consulting which provided political cover for both of these mistakes.",1322434623

For 6 day out of the week I'll only eat red meat, chicken, fish, sweet potatoes, broccoli, natural peanut butter and ezekiel bread. I keep it high protein, typically around 50-60% protein, then fats and carbs make up the rest. I don't count calories, if I get hungry I eat and just make sure I'm eating more protein than fats or carbs. 1 day out of the week I have a massive cheat day, eat anything and everything. If you do this right, you'll feel sick by the end of the day.

Realistically, however, you need to look at the value of the data as opposed to the cost to retrieve it.  For example, if all that is stored on the servers are a bunch of MPAA movies for streaming content (Akamai CDN or similar), the cost to a hacker to retrieve the data is not greater than the value of the data itself.  After all, any content on Akamai CDN can most likely be found on some other channel like Bittorrent at a much lower cost than drilling out a hardware case and using freon on the DIMMs.  The sophistication needed for that type of attack is only viable if the target data is worth $millions, and I suspect that nobody will be using home furnace servers for that type of processing.<p>The key is to make the cost of accessing the data greater than the value of the data.

In the event of damages or unruly behavior, they can kick someone out or have them arrested in short order. AirBnB listings tend be owned by individuals or families, and are often rented when those owners are absent. I can&#x27;t imagine a security deposit in such a situation of less than 10% of the property&#x27;s value.",1375595964

One was in the NYCDOE - she could talk your ear off about the mispraftices of the teacher&#x27;s union and the unfairness of lackeys promoted to a position of tenure in a school administration.<p>There&#x27;s another issue here too - I know very qualified teachers who can&#x27;t leave the city public schools because people with tenure reduce the amount of open positions on the market. This is partly market saturation of teachers, but still, it&#x27;s hard to find a lucrative school system with more than one position open, and even then it&#x27;s flooded with spammed resumes.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;d like to note that the &quot;unfireability&quot; isn&#x27;t by itself a bad thing. It&#x27;s just that the system rewards consistent mediocrity rather than relatively untested brilliance. The first people out the door are young and unexperienced teachers, <i>even</i> if they have a higher track record for success than their seniors. It&#x27;s deplorable.",1375595955

I can see how the words would have the desired effect in a political speech, but is it really THAT common a problem?<p>Yes, it is, but no, it isn&#x27;t. I present, for your consideration, <i>the most depressing number in the world</i>:<p><a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2FS0145-2134(96)00180-9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2FS0145-2134(96)00180-9</a><p>&quot;female and male child sexual abuse prevalence estimates [...] were 14.5% and 7.2%&quot;<p>That&#x27;s one in seven girls, one in fourteen boys. CSA is quite honestly the most insane and awful aspect of Western society bar none. And <i>decades</i> of crackdowns, teacher-initiated interventions, and, well, spying on every phone call in the country have failed to make a real difference.<p>So we target child pornography. We target child pornography because child sexual abuse is the biggest social problem in the modern era, and we don&#x27;t know what else to do about it. I don&#x27;t, honestly, know of any real evidence that there is much to be accomplished this way. Porn isn&#x27;t correlated with rape and even though in this case there&#x27;s no way that the porn could be made ethically it&#x27;s a bit like stomping termites in a sinking boat.<p>The thinking is really that by damaging pedophiles&#x27; online support network they will be discouraged from engaging in such repulsive acts. Unfortunately, while I&#x27;d like to see it work, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to me: people were raping children long before fiber optics got involved.<p>I don&#x27;t really have a good answer.

6154777,comment,6152781,6154149,3,0,justinschuh,,,"> It certainly seems relevant, because Dartium has cross-VM leaks.<p>Sorry, I must have looked at the wrong message, because reading it now, that&#x27;s not at all the context I was responding to. However, that message was so late in the thread that are you really surprised it didn&#x27;t get answered? The conclusion had been reached hours earlier and the broad consensus was clearly to not support multiple run-time VMs in WebKit.<p>> I am sorry that you interpreted my concerns as flaming or trolling. My point is quite simply that the cross-VM garbage collection story is one of the chief concerns that other browser manufacturers have with Dart,<p>Mozilla has had support for multiple VM bindings for as long as I can remember. I know at least ActiveState has shipped products based on it. So, it strikes me as very dubious for you to argue like this is some sort of fundamentally intractable problem.<p>> as evidenced by that webkit-dev thread<p>It seems like you read a tremendous amount a late response to a concluded thread.<p>>as well as conversations I have been a part of or witnessed since Dartium was announced.<p>Forgive me, but you haven&#x27;t cited any of those.<p>> As of the time that message was sent the Chromium story has been Oilpan, and that does not assuage this concern. An alternative story from Dart&#x27;s side that could be demonstrated to prevent DOM leaks in a reference-counted DOM world would go a long way here, but it does not seem that Dart is currently taking this into consideration.<p>To be honest, I don&#x27;t really know what Dart is doing beyond what shows up on mailing lists. It&#x27;s not part of Chromium so it&#x27;s not a pressing concern for me. I have had involvement with the team working on Oilpan, because it&#x27;s a Chromium project and it looks like it could help address object lifetime issues, which are a major security concern. And regardless of anything that may or may not happen with Dart, the outcome of Oilpan is very important for Chromium and V8.<p>> Edit: I was pointed by a colleague to this presentation by Lars Bak which confirms this. Page 44: <a href=""http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/io-2013/presentation.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/io-2013/presentation...</a>.<p>The whole first half of that presentation enumerates the issues with V8&#x27;s current GC. So, are you really still disputing that the primary purpose of Oilpan is to address issues in V8&#x27;s GC?<p>> Edit 2: Another colleague of mine pointed out that I said &quot;memory model&quot; when I should have said &quot;memory management implementation&quot;. Apologies for being inaccurate there.<p>One statement implies that there&#x27;s some fundamental incompatibility affecting any design. The other implies implementation details that need to be resolved. I think an objective observer would find that the distinction between the two is very important.",1375594760
6154775,comment,6141639,6141639,2,0,noufalibrahim,,,"Many Indian developers choose their field based on parental and social pressure. I&#x27;ve been working with students in Engineering colleges in India and a significant fraction say that they joined Engineering just because their parents told them to and/or because they want high paying jobs. It&#x27;s considered undignified in some sense to not have a professional degree. This causes an increase in demand and consequently, private players and others step in to meet it. These institutions churn out a huge number of engineering graduates every year who don&#x27;t particularly care about their field or their job. That&#x27;s the first stage. You have a huge pool of (at best) average developers. They&#x27;re entire &quot;programming education&quot; is four years of working on outdated technologies and a shaky theoretical foundation taught to them by (mostly) uninterested teachers.<p>The next stage is the service companies. If you&#x27;re an A player, and these are as common in the Indian tech. community as in others though they&#x27;re harder to find because the large number of people you have to wade through to get to them, you&#x27;ll already have some open source contributions and contacts with other good programmers and they&#x27;ll get there. The others, who are the bulk, don&#x27;t have all of these privileges and don&#x27;t know what to do. To their aid come service companies. These are the organisations I blame for most of the, often justified, stereotypes of Indian programmers. They hire people in bulk, give them some focussed training (since their formal education is often worthless) and then expose them to the world of cheap outsourced software development.<p>This is where many foreign devs and Indian devs meet and this is the &quot;most average&quot; of the Indian tech. crowd you&#x27;ll find. They&#x27;re uninterested, driven by things low on Maslow&#x27;s pyramid and generally worry about things like saving face, getting promotions, pleasing managers and rising up the social and professional ladder rather than good tech.<p>Naturally, these people are &quot;cheap&quot; and &quot;unskilled&quot;. They were selected from the larger pool for mostly those reasons.<p>If you&#x27;ve come into contact with Indian devs from good tech. conferences, mailing lists, free software projects, irc or other such fora, your experience is bound to be difference since you&#x27;re meeting the ones that have gone through another filter.<p>The sad thing is that the education systems can crush people and make them unmotivated and uninterested. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to remedy, atleast to some extent, with my latest endeavour. I&#x27;ve taught students at colleges and there&#x27;s often some spark in them that can be nurtured.

In any such network, someone is providing the material, as in, someone is raping children and posting it to the darknet.

The same way a contract driver developer does, or a Rails dev. I happen to work in a particularly challenging problem domain. My work happens to have some interesting implications. But those implications are not the reason I work in the field; I work here because it allows me to grapple with compilers, number theory, low-level networking, hardware, OS kernels, and every imaginable development platform. It&#x27;s about the craft.<p>I find this vantage point, which appears amoral, makes the ethical dilemmas easier to resolve. If a company like Narus asks me to help them make a network monitoring system harder to evade, I don&#x27;t have to put that request into some ethical framework that considers the good that application might do. I just turn the work down. Same goes for the US Government; no, sorry, not interested.<p>Total respect for Alex (the &quot;white hat consulting company&quot; he founded is iSec Partners, our sister company and former archrival). I get the sense that Alex engages intentionally with these dilemmas, that he wants to be a part of something larger than himself and, I think, larger than the craft. As a result, sure, he has to live a carefully examined life, and make sure the projects he&#x27;s working on aren&#x27;t skewing his compass. I admire him for picking his way through those problems. But I&#x27;m every bit as engaged with the field as Alex is, and I&#x27;m here to tell you that you <i>don&#x27;t</i> have to get tangled up in these kinds of ethical problems if you don&#x27;t want to.",1375594020

And it&#x27;s valid to consider this suspicious? I&#x27;ve queried how to get entry into Russia before, I hope that didn&#x27;t trigger any kind of alarm.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bm2koyUqmU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bm2koyUqmU</a>",1375592821

Even though I agree with your premise that public schools need to change the rules that have allowed so many ineffective teachers to stay in the system, I have to say that if I were in Jersey City, I would not vote for you, at least not based on your post. Here&#x27;s why:<p>First, you come off as highly dismissive of teachers in general. Grammar, body language, word choice, and even the way someone conjugates &quot;to be&quot; is often linked to a person&#x27;s ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or cultural group. To compare that to the language found in &quot;a prison yard&quot; is insulting and makes me think you&#x27;re more focused on judging how these teachers speak than on addressing the actual concerns they raised.<p>Likewise, your calculation on how many hours teachers work is a best-case estimate. I&#x27;m not a teacher but I know many, and I went to public school. So I know just how often teachers get to school 30mins to an hour early to prep, work through their lunches, and stay hours after to help students, grade tests, write letters of recommendation, meet with parents, and host clubs or coach sports. And then there are the multiple days at the end of each quarter when teachers work through nights and weekends putting together progress reports. Do you want to factor that into your estimate?<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure how it is in Jersey City, but most teachers I know spend hundreds of dollars out of their own money on supplies each year because school districts don&#x27;t have the cash to pay for pencils and paper and other basic supplies.<p>What school boards need is not someone who is antagonistic to teachers, but someone who is willing to work with them.",1375592800

The pool of teacher candidates is already compromised since the students pursuing education majors are already the poorest performing of any other college major.  Even discounting for the worst performers never completing the degree and licensing requirements, we are generally not talking about a group that is blazing any intellectual trails.  Then once a teacher secures a position, there is little incentive for a teacher to improve on the job.  Nearly every other job would require some amount for ongoing training, but in education that is rarely implemented.<p>Teacher quality starts with making the field attractive to more higher performing students.  That only happens if the field provides incentives to reward excellence and hard work, and the current arrangement just does not do that.  It rewards mediocrity.",1375592561

And the BBC is _by far_ not the worst offender here.<p>I mean, even YLE, which should be happy that anybody outside of Finland wants to participate in the madness that is the Finnish language, blocks me based on my IP!<p>Of course, I am well aware that I am a German citizen and thus not paying into the BBC financing. This is of course an insourmountable obstacle, today in 2014.<p>It&#x27;s not like there was any possible way to track which countries the programmes are watched from and then install some transfer payment systems between the publically financed broadcasters of the different countries.<p>Admittedly, our public broadcasters here in Germany have an annual budget of only 7.5 Billion Euros, so this is impossible to finance.<p>Man, I&#x27;m frustrated about this. Why is the media world so broken? Who runs a television station and then makes a significant effort to _keep_ people from watching it, even though them doing so has no or negligible impact on their budget?",1394539029

7378554,comment,7377798,7378358,1,0,Ingon,,,"Among the negatives of standups are:<p>- Rarely the right information. Every person in the team have different needs for information. It is even harder to deliver the right amount and on the right level if your team includes designers, quality engineers, project/product managers.<p>- Rarely at the right time. If your company culture includes flexible hours, no matter at what time you put the standup somebody will suffer. Most of the time the team members who come early suffer - they already started work, now you are forcing them to get out of context and attend a meeting.<p>- Sometimes standups are used as a way to force some team members to do what they have promised (the what I&#x27;ll do today). But if you are using them in this way is really counterproductive - you either trust that your peers are doing their best for the team or you might consider team change (which I understand is beyond our control sometimes).<p>- Failure to communicate (or &quot;the what problems I have/had&quot; part). If your team members are mature enough and they had a problem during the course of the day, they shouldn&#x27;t wait for the next day&#x27;s standup to let everybody know about that. The should be proactive and seek resolution as the problem comes up.<p>- Finally the &quot;what I did yesterday&quot; part. This information is commonly used by the managers, but there are better ways to deliver it. Most of us use some way of tracking our work. We only need to flow this information to our managers. It is also a mind shift for them - instead somebody pushing this information to them, they should be proactive and seek it and pull it. If you don&#x27;t know what somebody is working on, then go and ask him. You don&#x27;t need to loose the time of the whole team for this.<p>That being said whether you will use standups or not depends largely on your team dynamics. In new teams or teams formed largely by junior developers it makes sense to have standups - its a way to force communication patterns and certainly can be used as a casual form of a team building. But in my opinion as the team matures there is less and less need for standups, so at one point it just becomes a hurdle. And the good thing about being agile (not SCRUM) is that you can evaluate your process and change it as you (and your team) see it fit.",1394536967

Perhaps even manage archive formats automatically (autoextraction)\n- An api for subtitles\n- Build statistics, time watched, tv shows added per x time etc.\n- Store metadata like time media was paused at (to resume at), with a visual indicator in the catalog view\n- Automated parsing of releases, soft renaming\n- Scrape data for each item, generate tags from that data, categories\n- Archiving, sorting, grouping\n- Personalized catalogs of &quot;what I watch&quot;. Kind of like how you might customize <a href=""http://pogdesign.co.uk/cat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pogdesign.co.uk/cat/</a>\n- A real-time tracker for new releases.

Alternatively, it could, for TV, just utilize airtimes from TVRage\n- Personalized page that lists all of the stuff you are looking for. List of things that you haven&#x27;t downloaded yet but are in your list etc.\n- Integrated user defined searches. Allowing one to search their favorite sources autocompleted with things in the application&#x27;s local catalog of &quot;stuff you want/watch&quot;.\n- A nice dark interface, surprisingly a lot like what Popcorn Time is doing, though much more complex and functional.\n- The ability to choose your own media player to launch, thus giving up statistics, pause time and &quot;watched&quot; states. Would require the user to commit this info themselves, with a form popping up whenever they launch something from the app if they so choose.\n- Multiple sub-users per &quot;catalog&quot;, so that one person would have access to the same file but may not have watched/behaved the same way as another user on the network\n- Integrated &quot;coming soon&quot; feed for tv and movies that you could preemptively select to be notified about.\n- One big database file that would be dynamic to the content available to it. This way the installation could be portable, and whenever it detects its on a different system (Synced by a dropbox service or a USB drive), the app will ask to specify watch-folders to sync with the database so that one could keep track of their &quot;catalog&quot;, add things to it etc.\n- Open source, built on node-webkit like Popcorn. No datamining, pro privacy.\n- Works in a browser, thus on phones (I guess some TV&#x27;s/Consoles too?) connected to the WLAN\n- Integration of a &quot;WebUI&quot; from popular torrent clients, with a custom standardized interface for all of them.<p>So basically XBMC for pirates, I guess.<p>Something tells me it&#x27;s a niche market.",1394536433

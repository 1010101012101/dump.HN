All you need to talk about hereditary traits in these contexts is some vague notion of what seems plausible and believable, and not any actual data. And yet, people are probably going to find it more believable because genetics are involved than someone who explicitly bases it on some purely sociological theory, because genes sound more tangible than sociological theory and the statistics based on that.<p>It&#x27;s not that there is anything wrong with making up theories. But by stating that it has to do with genes - without any initial disclaimer that it is just a theory - makes it sound like it is based on data and not just a theory.",1393775983

How is this different from the political propaganda in any other way than the former serves to further business and the latter serves to further an ideology?

A company rarely has Zero Assets. In the case of MT. Gox they likely have about $4M in assets that will be sold to cover those who are owed something.  Depending on who you ask that could be a few billion to a few hundred million. So let&#x27;s make the napkin math easy and say they owe $500 Million and they have $5M in assets, every bitcoin you had would be paid at a penny on the dollar.<p>Will anyone go to jail?<p>Most likely not. Mt. Gox claims they were wronged, not that they stole your money.  If that is true, or a bug caused them to lose your money it would be the same as if a bank was robbed prior to FDIC insurance (if they were robbed) or if the bank just invested poorly. They didn&#x27;t do anything criminal. They were just stupid. Prior to FDIC putting your money in a bank meant if the bank failed your money was gone. (FDIC insures you up to $100k in a bank, but does nothing for Cryptocurrency). If Mt. Gox was a Ponzi scheme that would change this answer, but I don&#x27;t hear people saying that.<p>What should you do if you want to get your money back?<p>Make sure that you are named at the bankruptcy hearing. Yes, that may mean going to Japan. If you lost $100k or more it may be worth going. There will be tiers of payback, and those who were most injured will get the most back. Someone who lost $29 is likely going to get nothing, ever. But if you lost $1m you may be able to get 10% of that back.  If you lost more than $100k you may want to sue Karpeles out side of bankruptcy. While the Bankruptcy protects him from being sued for losses, it doesn&#x27;t fully protect against negligence. He has personal assets. You need to talk to a lawyer about this, as the rules are complex, and your losses would have to be near catastrophic, because this would be a punitive reward, not something based on debt.<p>Can you sue the VC&#x27;s?<p>Only if you think you can prove that they knew Mt. Gox was doing something illegal, that the public didn&#x27;t know.  Bankrolling Silk Road wouldn&#x27;t count for example.",1393773861

7329329,comment,7326214,7327138,6,0,nbouscal,,,"My take on why monoids seem to be thought of as concatenation in the Haskell community is that the other simple examples run into some difficulty with the way the type class system is set up. Specifically, the example you used requires a newtype wrapper, because the nats (ints really, we don&#x27;t use nats much) are a monoid under both addition and multiplication. We don&#x27;t have any better way of dealing with multiple instances, so we create a Sum newtype and a Product newtype. This adds enough friction that those instances seem to not get used all that much. Other examples of this are the Boolean monoid under conjunction or disjunction, and the monoid of endomorphisms under composition. Those instances all exist, but I rarely (if ever) see them used.<p>There are definitely some more general uses of the Monoid type class than concatenation that don&#x27;t require newtypes, but they are slightly harder to understand, so they don&#x27;t tend to get trotted out as examples. The best example I can think of is Ordering (LT | EQ | GT), which is a monoid in the sense of lexicographical ordering. You also have Function (a -> b) and Maybe b, which are each monoids when b is a monoid, but if b is a monoid under concatenation then those just look like concatenation too.<p>One other reason I think they&#x27;re thought of as concatenation is that monoids under concatenation are <i>extremely</i> useful. The most common case is when appending things that are like strings. Strings are not performant, so for anything significant you want to use Text or ByteString. However, it&#x27;s not uncommon to use Strings when you&#x27;re first figuring things out. If you want to then switch over to Text and you used String appending (++), you&#x27;ll have to find and replace every instance of that. If you instead used Monoid appending (<>), you can switch the types and everything will still work. Quite nice.",1393772774

If you ever make a big loss, in the sense that backing something like Google or Facebook would have been a big win, you&#x27;re probably doing investment wrong. The dominant US tech investment strategy today appears to be accepting many relatively small losses on the basis that one smash hit will outweigh them all.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that in US-centric discussions, the distinction often seems to be stated in terms of &quot;risk-aversion&quot;, with a focus on how much downside is acceptable and how US investors tend to accept more risk.

Cokes image isn&#x27;t the same today as it was 10 years ago. You don&#x27;t do that if you aim for existing customers because they started buying the product when the image was different.

OS&#x27;s like iOS and Android are very aggressive about preserving memory and processor cycles as a way of squeezing extra life out of batteries.<p>On phones that different-OS resource advantage will probably continue.

I just used one as the quantity in my example because I was assuming that a single person would only download a single copy of a given good.<p>I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> say that the effect of zero-price downloads is trivial. I said that you cannot conclude anything about the quantity of a good that would be demanded at, say $10, by observing that there is some quantity demanded at a price of zero. This was a direct response to your sentence &quot;And yet, demand for that media was nevertheless satisfied.&quot;<p>> Moreover, the producer typically cares about the price point at which the number of sales and the value of each sale combine to produce the greatest possible revenue.<p>Greatest profit, actually, but you&#x27;re pretty close. But I don&#x27;t see your point. I&#x27;m not suggesting that all media creators should price their content at zero (although that certainly is a valid strategy that can and has worked).<p>> Moreover, all demand satisfied at the zero point is removed from the pool in which the ideal price / volume relation can be found, given that volume is a function of demand.<p>Not exactly. I have purchased media legally after having downloaded the very same media illegally, and it wasn&#x27;t because I lost my downloaded copy. But anyway, this claim still ignores my point, which is that the fact that there is nonzero quantity demanded at zero price tells you very little about how much is being removed from the pool at non-zero prices. To use an obvious example, a person with zero disposable income can download an album for free despite it being impossible for him to purchase it at any non-zero price. Or to use another obvious example, I can download music at least 50 times faster than I can listen to it, and certainly faster than I could afford to pay for it. If I were to download a terabyte of music this week, that tells you essentially nothing about how much music I would be capable or willing to buy legally if I were unable to pirate music.",1406066486

In contrast, the non-""while"" version lets you stay in the moment.</i><p>I disagree.  The word ""while"" does connote time, but it's just the word chosen by early programmers to describe a process of performing an action immediately depending on current conditions, with no knowledge of history.  Recursion amounts to the same thing -- <i>after</i> you make the mental leap of a tail-recursive optimization.  When you climb the next step, you're climbing it because it's part of the definition of climbing the <i>rest</i> of the steps, which was part of the definition of climbing the rest of the steps when you were on the previous step.  As I pointed out in another comment, when you're climbing the last step of a twelve-step staircase, you're actually performing twelve ""climb up the steps"" operations that are nested like Russian dolls.  Thinking recursively is only simple when you learn to mentally simplify all of that, basically to think in terms of the ""same machine code"" you mention in your comment.  I don't think we arrive at that ""machine code"" starting from a recursive definition of climbing the stairs.  It seems much more likely that we figure out the implementation (the while loop) long before we figure out (if we ever do) that we can derive that implementation from a recursive definition of the task.",1302709818

You can do all of your tax returns online and you can use your annual CT600 tax return as your return for Companies House. The annual return is just a few pages and can be completed by anyone who can read the explanatory notes. Hiring staff is only marginally more complex and HMRC provide a suite of software to help you manage payroll, income tax and national insurance. The only real gotcha is remembering to register for VAT if your sales within the EU exceed £73,000 in any 12-month period - at that point you may wish to consult an accountant to get your VAT accounting straight, as mistakes with VAT can get expensive quickly.<p>As a web app startup your tax affairs are likely to be as simple as they get and I'd suggest contacting your local HMRC office for advice - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how helpful they are and how straightforward tax is for small companies.

Core user-interface concepts like event dispatching/handling really benefit from language features built with them in mind. Portable functions on some level.. like C#'s delegates, or any of the closure proposals..<p>And then yeah, all of the alternatives.. defining UIs in XML, literally ANY of the Java web frameworks. They all suffer from core problems: Writing Java code can be frankly kinda slow and cumbersome compared to other (more dynamic) languages. That's a totally reasonable tradeoff for the benefits you get back when, say.. you're building out some business logic, or implementing a network protocol... but in the land of declarative user-interfaces (including web ones).. more often than not the frameworks mortgage away loads of the compile-time niceness without giving you the benefit of a dynamic language framework's velocity or brevity.<p>I do think writing user interfaces (of any kind) in Java pretty much sucks.

Trust me, for every good self-help book out there, there are dozens of insanely useless ones - it is not easy to pick the good ones on one's own.  self-help books are a big industry - even those who never read anything in their life, would give a few minutes of their attention to self-help books, because ultimately, <i>everyone</i> wants to become better at <i>something</i><p>I just wish there were some good ways to quickly separate junk from good books.",1322416595

3282879,comment,3282793,3282793,7,0,chimeracoder,,,">  I think it is, but there are significant ramifications that will result from the decoupling of currencies from governments.<p>The decoupling of currencies from governments sounds like a radical shift, but it's actually only fairly recent in history that we use fiat money. That, of course, allows us to do a lot of things that we've gotten used to in the last century particularly, such as taking advantage of monetary policy to address short-term economic concerns.<p>If alternative currencies catch on, that's something that governments will have less power to do - or at least, less power to do directly and predictably. Certainly, governments are going to push back on that, and probably try to discredit or disable alternative currencies.<p>At the end of the day, though, while money can be determined by fiat, value is determined subjectively, so if alternative currencies catch on (which I think they well), it will necessitate a shift in the way that people think about money. (Not unlike the way that the Internet has shifted the way people think about tradable goods and IP law - just take a look at SOPA.)",1322416435

For something that is so thoroughly baked into the American way of life, I think 20 years isnt a bad estimate.<p>I'm not totally up on autonomous car tech, but while very promising, it still seems to be proof of concept stage. To me that means ~10 years from commercializarion, and then at least 10 years before it has penetrated enough of the fleet that you can even start to consider making it mandatory. Automotive engineering is conservative because of the scale and age of the industry, the cost of the goods sold, and the risks inherent in their failure. Automobile owners are conservative because cars are big purchases.<p>The thing about timeframes like that is that there are enough unknowns that estimates can easily be 2x too optimistic.<p>I tend to agree that rail (whether urban light rail, or region high speed rail) may not be the most cost effective way to move a lot of people from point a to point b given existing patterns of development, I know that part of the reason planners favor it is that its cost comes comes as part of a permanence that can shape the way communities develop around it over the long term.",1322415711

Unless you have a specific reason for wanting to use a Unix OS.</i><p>See, that's what I'm talking about. Lots of the crap Windows throws at you is simply accepted because people do not even realize anymore that it's crap.<p>To name a few which annoy me every time I am forced to use Windows:<p>-No or very limited customization of the entire GUI (or the OS in general, for no reason whatsoever - this goes for OS X, too, btw).<p>-Forced mouse usage, either because it's impossible to do something with the keyboard or it's highly inconvenient to do so.<p>-Hiding basic functionality (for example, showing/hiding hidden folders) deep in some non-intuitive system menus.<p>-Often being forced to do something in a specific way because someone at Microsoft thought this should be the only way to do something, whether that's intuitive and/or efficient or not. More often than not, it's neither.<p>I could go on like this for hours, but I'll admit that I am in fact biased myself. Still, many of the things that annoy me have been noticed by people I know (and who use Windows) as well. Any single one of the points I noted above are deal breakers for me.<p><i>>Sure you have more problems with virus/crapware etc but getting their long suffering nephew to come around every few months to re-install everything may well be less of an inconvenience than not being able to use their Windows only cross stitch software or train simulator etc.</i><p>I don't think so. That's what wine is for, and 95% of all programs will run flawlessly with it. If you set it up correctly on a user-friendly distro, they will not even notice the difference.<p>Maybe you can even find free (as in Freedom) alternatives. For lots of applications, these exist, and for the most part, they are either on par or sometimes better than their Windows-only counterparts. I already try to convert people to cross-platform applications on Windows (for example, Pidgin) so they could more easily switch to a better OS some day.<p><i>>My point is that looking at badly rendered websites and having poor usability may still be better for them than losing use of this app.</i><p>And my point is that badly rendered websites is the price those corporations will have to pay if they want to continue to use their application.

3282808,comment,3282490,3282490,22,0,tree_of_item,,,"""We Brits believe that alcohol has magical powers  that it causes us to shed our inhibitions and become aggressive, promiscuous, disorderly and even violent.<p>But we are wrong. In high doses, alcohol impairs our reaction times, muscle control, co-ordination, short-term memory, perceptual field, cognitive abilities and ability to speak clearly. But it does not cause us selectively to break specific social rules. It does not cause us to say, Oi, what you lookin at? and start punching each other. Nor does it cause us to say, Hey babe, fancy a shag? and start groping each other.<p>The effects of alcohol on behaviour are determined by cultural rules and norms, not by the chemical actions of ethanol. There is enormous cross-cultural variation in the way people behave when they drink alcohol.  In  the vast majority of cultures,  drinking is not associated with these undesirable behaviours  Alcohol is just a morally neutral, normal, integral part of ordinary, everyday life  about on a par with, say, coffee or tea. <p>This variation cannot be attributed to different levels of consumption.  Instead the variation is clearly related to different cultural beliefs about alcohol.  This basic fact has been proved time and again  in carefully controlled scientific experiments  double-blind, placebos and all. To put it very simply, the experiments show that when people think they are drinking alcohol, they behave according to their cultural beliefs about the behavioural effects of alcohol. <p>Those who most strongly believe that alcohol causes aggression are the most likely to become aggressive when they think that they have consumed alcohol.  These experiments show that even when people are very drunk, if they are given an incentive (either financial reward or even just social approval) they are perfectly capable of remaining in complete control of their behaviour  of behaving as though they were totally sober. <p>If I were given total power, I could very easily engineer a nation in which coffee would become a huge social problem.  I would restrict access to coffee, thus immediately giving it highly desirable forbidden-fruit status. Then I would issue lots of dire warnings about the dangerously disinhibiting effects of coffee. I would make sure everyone knew that even a mere three cups (six units) of coffee can lead to anti-social, aggressive and violent behaviour, and sexual promiscuity, thus instantly giving young people a powerful motive to binge-drink double espressos, and a perfect excuse to behave very badly after doing so.""<p><a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15265317"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15265317</a>",1322414781

Lots of older homes around the US have 100 amp service or even smaller.<p>Is this furnace going to clamp onto the existing supply or do we need to get additional capacity into each home?  If the system takes the place of the heat pump in the winter that's okay but what about the summer?  You mean I'm going to have a furnace <i>and</i> an A/C unit fighting for electricity in my home?<p>Adding capacity isn't always as simple as calling up the electrician and adding a phase to the breaker box.  Now we're stringing cables, digging up backyards, and running lines to transformers in neighborhoods (like mine) where the infrastructure explodes if a squirrel farts in the wrong direction (I'm looking at you, ComEd).",1322413210

Whether you choose to them depends on how dirty it makes you feel, but few browsers will actually care.<p>A separate but related lesson is that Google cares a ton about performance, so you'll often find these byte-saving tricks in high-traffic Google pages. e.g. the use of ""//foo.com"" instead of ""<a href=""http://foo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foo.com</a>.",1322413206

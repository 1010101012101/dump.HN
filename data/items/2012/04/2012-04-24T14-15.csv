In business terms, that means that the cost of buying into a company is less than the profit you are expecting to realise through dividends over the long run.<p>The idea (modern trend?) of having companies that pay no dividends, whose shares are valuable only because someone else might buy them for more money later, seems to me to be exactly what tomgallard said: a sure sign of a bubble.<p>I've often wondered why we allow companies, particularly publicly traded ones, to sit on an ever-growing war chest rather than paying out their profits to investors as dividends. I don't know enough grown-up economics to appreciate the realistic consequences of regulating that kind of behaviour, but the zero-dividend, war-chest approach seems to promote all the wrong behaviours in terms of markets and investors, assuming your goal is to have a healthy economy that promotes making useful products and providing useful services.",1335279348

3884190,comment,3883682,3883842,2,0,datagramm,,,"On the home-schooling argument. I'm not saying you shouldn't home school your kids, but in my opinion avoiding bullies is not the best reason to do so. I can understand that people want to protect their kids, but I think it's much more effective to teach them to deal with it rather than just avoiding it.<p>I think it's incredibly short sighted to think that bullying just stops once school ends. People just learn to deal with it through years of practice. Learning to deal with crap like this is an incredibly valuable life skill and if you don't learn it at school you're going to have to learn it later in life. Sure, kids can be a lot more cruel than adults, but delaying the inevitable solves nothing.<p>I went to a state school in the north of England which could be described as 'rough' at best. Like many geeks I never really fitted in and was the subject of some fairly severe bullying at times. Like most people that were bullied (and anecdotal evidence would suggest that most people were bullied at one time or another) I got through it and never looked back. As soon as I gave up trying to fit in (and even started going out of my way not to fit in) people respected me a little more for it and life got easier.<p>Not that I want to tell people how they they should raise their kids here. I don't even have any kids of my own. But having been a child for a number of years I feel somewhat qualified to speak on the matter.",1335279270

From the trailer video it appears that only key panels are animated, which makes more sense to me in terms of adding value.<p>Far from a gimmick, it adds to the kinematic aesthetic; instead of motion lines and blurs, he is able to show us the action directly.  Graphic novels and movies (or any filmed narrative) are approached in very similar ways; pacing, lighting, composition -- these are all core aspects of both.  Will Eisner touches on this, if memory serves correctly, in the ""Eisner/Miller"" book.<p>Of course, all of this is speculation until we see the actual product; but if he approaches it in a manner similar to something like Magical Game Time[1], I believe it will be successful.

I've given a good deal of thought to this 'weirdness' and have my own conclusions about <i>true normal</i> which partly align with this article.<p>Now, some things people do, say and are actually are a bit odd and perhaps not good. We need to change. Labelling one's self as weird isn't a pass to do whatever the hell you want. I've learnt that.

The good things, improve them too.<p>The selfish relativity of the modern island is a sham that's going to collapse on the heads of those followers soon enough. We people seek to understand others, that is when things change.

I think there are two problems: first, everybody is lumped into the same groupings, so the ""advanced"" kids are bored and the ""slower"" kids are lost. That leads to conflict on its own, but then we make it worse by expecting everybody to go college track with one other option: drop out.<p>For many kids, the college track education is worthless. My neighbor believes she can spot kids who are likely to drop out in second grade (there is a LOT of confirmation bias in that, I'm sure, but probably some truth). By making them all move ahead lock-step, we are, ironically, guaranteeing they are going to fragment and have problems.<p>It is encouraging to see some signs of change in education (at least here in Utah). There are a lot more trade options (ability to get a CNA in high school or starting apprenticeships in trades, for example). The math program is being re-built in an attempt to change it from ""this grade learns algebra, so if you aren't learning algebra in this grade, you are dumb"". On the flip side, my kids' high school has partnered with the local state university to provide kids with the ability to have an associates degree by the time they graduate high school.<p>So while education has been broken for a long time, and is still bad, at least anecdotally, it is getting better. The factory training ground aspect is changing, but, unfortunately, the authoritarian part is still getting worse (see, for instance, the six year old who was arrested for throwing a tantrum).",1335278895

The public school environment exposed me to the most different groups of folks available and made us all interact.<p>Even in technical jobs and working for programming firms, my bosses and coworkers have included a lot more of the folks I never got along with than the folks I identified with, there are just more of them out there in the world, and I am glad I have a clue why they don't like some things and what I can do to minimize or handle the conflicts.<p>It's probably not for everyone - it takes a fair bit of personal motivation to still learn when it clearly isn't strictly required of you - but it isn't automatically bad.<p>At the age when it would have mattered, I would not have had the wisdom to make the right choice.  If my parents had offered me the chance to not deal with my problems, I would have jumped at it, and been worse for that choice.",1335278715

Someone can torment and bully you with impunity and its your own responsibility to learn to ""deal"" with it?)<p>Second, homeschoolers interact with many different kinds of people all of the time. Our kids play in community ensembles, participate in non-school sporting leagues, attend music and theater performances (during the day!), and experience the world with us in general. They have close friends their own age and younger and older.<p>The ""home"" and the ""school"" in homeschool is misleading. Many of us spend significant parts of our days out of the home.

3884106,comment,3879926,3883603,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"Sysadmin/Ops should have a part in what gets deployed. It is their job. My point is that if you have a choice between Python 2.6 that comes with your distro and Python 2.7 that doesn't, go with 2.6. The cost is minimal. Same for various libraries (PIL, NumPy, etc.) I currently have to deploy Django-Piston directly from a master branch on GitHub due to some terrible decisions made by developers who never gave deployment a second thought. Avoid this. If you would save more hours by using a newer library, minus time it takes to set it up and maintain it in production, go for it, but don't discount the cost on the Ops side.<p>I don't have a problem with virtualenv: it's a fine <i>development</i> tool, but it is not what I would use in production. If you want separate clean environments for each app, use KVM or Xen and give it a whole server.<p>supervisord is a fine solution. I just prefer that my processes look exactly like system processes. Upstart and rc.d are fantastic and do everything I need well.<p>As for separation of code and configuration, I simply mean that in my case I use Debian packages to deploy all of our software. This means that each package must be generic enough that it is deployable so long as its dependencies are satisfied. Thus your config files are mostly external to your packages. Then you can easily use Puppet or some such to deploy code. One other reason to use native distro packages: Puppet does not play well with pip/easy_install, etc.<p>>> Lastly, DO use apache + mod_wsgi. It is fast, stable, widely supported and well tested.<p>> And nginx + uwsgi/gunicorn arent?<p>I didn't say that. I am simply stating that saying ""don't use apache"" is wrong. Do use it. You can <i>also</i> use nginx + uwsgi/gunicorn if you want to, but apache is by no means a bad choice. It's got 25 years of use and nobody that uses it seriously is complaining.<p>> Absolutely. nginx is way past the new and hacky state though.<p>It is not, and I never said so. I use nginx + apache, where nginx is a reverse proxy. In fact nginx is my top choice for front-end server setups. I am saying, don't deploy things directly out of GitHub. Go with slightly older, more tested stuff. It'll be a bigger payoff in the end.<p>Overall, I think we are saying the same thing, with slightly different tools we normally reach for.

This leads to all the terrible social behavior you see in most secondary and high school in the U.S. Somebody calling you ""weird"" can really be a badge of honor.<p>But there's nothing to be gained in being different in itself. While you should be who you are, if you only define yourself in how weird you are compared to others <i>you're doing the same thing, only in reverse.</i> Instead of saying ""I will look at my peers and copy them"" you're saying ""I will look at my peers and do the opposite"" Both of these are just the same kind of herd thinking.

A combination of obedience to authority and placating bullies. It's more like being in the army, or in prison, than a modern workplace or a group of friends. At least in a group of friends you can talk freely, without needing permission or being teased.<p>I think one learns more subtle and useful social skills from interacting with friends (i.e. voluntary relationships, where either party is free to leave) and from interacting with colleagues.<p>In my case, this occurred in the years just after school.<p>I won't say that school doesn't teach a certain amount of valuable knowledge, but that knowledge can be obtained elsewhere, without the huge overhead of learning to share space with bullies, thugs, and people in authority who think they know what is best for you.<p>And I haven't mentioned the enormous <i>cost</i> of schooling: 12 years of your young life (instead of doing more enjoyable things that you stand to learn far more from). And for most people, stunting of individuality and destruction of creativity (which cripples the ability to learn new things later in life).<p>I think most people just assume that schools are good places to learn social skills because they were forced to go through it themselves, so they had to embrace it at the time. After a while, they look back with nostalgia, forgetting how much boredom and fear they had to endure.",1335277761

3884069,comment,3883682,3883682,21,0,abraxasz,,,"I like the article, a lot. But I have some reserve with the advice given.<p>In my experience, many people would actually be glad to hangout with someone weird if he gives them some time to get used to it, and take it easy on the weirdness at first. I consider myself weird (my weirdness is that I mostly don't give a shit about conventional thinking and politically correct things. I just love a good argument, to the point where I would provoke people I barely know into arguments about politics, religion, whatever), and I have to be extra-careful with what I say and do, otherwise people freak out. Sometimes I slip and people think I'm crazy. But I'm getting better know, and I have a group of friend with which I can be myself. I provoke them playfully and they understand that it's just the way I am. And I'm grateful that they do.<p>Someone quoted Alain de Boutton in the thread: ""Intimacy is the capacity to be rather weird with someone - and finding that that's ok with them"". That's exactly right, but intimacy is not something you get immediately, for free. It's something you have to build, it takes time, and sometimes it doesn't work. Most of all, it takes compromises: people will accept you as you are when they realize that you're interesting and that you care about them.<p>Now why should weird people go out of their way to befriend other people? Well you have to be pragmatic here, and think about what you really want. Friendship is an amazing thing, and is available to anyone, weird or not, and doesn't require you to change who you are. It just requires you to be patient and take it step by step. Is it being hypocritical? Pretending you're normal when you really aren't? Not if it's temporary. Think of it as a way to create a first contact, before working your way to a real connection, where both parties can act natural. That's what social interactions are about, that's what all this highschool BS is about, and that's why I think it's a bad idea to home school your kids.<p>EDIT: An example of my weirdness in action: I often mess up with girls I really like just because I can't help saying outrageous things just to spark a good old argument. Damn.",1335277635

Your kids will miss out on a huge period of personal growth and a large expansion of their experience dealing with other people which they will never be able to get back later.""<p>It is not necessarily the case that being homeschooled automatically equates to a child that has been sheltered from the real world. In reality, whether or not a child has missed out due to homeschooling depends heavily on the parents that are doing the homeschooling. A parent can homeschool their child and simulate a private school by integrating classes (with groups of children) from museums, libraries, and independent instructors. A parent can also homeschool their child by putting on a DVD and walking away.<p>I was homeschooled from pre-kindergarten through 12th grade. My parents relied on a lot of external classes to ensure that I was still able to develop the ability to interact with others. The reality for me was that I was able to have a far richer social environment as a result of my being homeschooled. By the time that I entered college, I had interacted with far more cultures and personality types than most of those around me. I went on to successfully complete my undergraduate and graduate degrees.<p>When I was homeschooled, I kept in contact with a small handful of friends that were also homeschooled. They all went on to do just fine in both college and in life. I realize that my experiences and those of my peers are anecdotal, but a study performed by the Discovery Institute in 2000 also provided evidence that there is no ""sheltering"" involved with most homeschools: <a href=""http://www.discovery.org/a/3479"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.discovery.org/a/3479</a><p>(Please note, I actually take issue with a few things in the Discovery Institute study, but I think that it does provide some degree of evidence that homeschooling does not automatically result in a maladjusted child.)<p>In my economics courses, we would sometimes take a look at the economic returns of education. I always found it strangely comical when someone would speak harshly about how homeschoolers are ""sheltered"" and then turn to me for moral support. It was always such a shock to everyone to hear that I had been homeschooled for my entire life. Some people even called me a liar outright. (I have always wondered what is it about homeschooling that seems to rub people the wrong way?)<p>I am well-spoken, outgoing, and have an easy time dealing with people. I do not say this (or anything else in this post) braggingly, but I say it to give credit to my parents for what their sacrifices were able to accomplish for me. You say that ""sheltering"" is the ""reality"" of what will happen, but how are you so sure of this?<p>I believe that the results of homeschooling, much like other forms of schooling, is a product of the teacher, the student, and the approach. I do not disagree that sometimes, with homeschooling, some children are not able to develop social skills. What I disagree with, strongly, is your insinuation that ""sheltering is the reality of homeschool"". Homeschooling a child does not automatically mean that the child will struggle socially.",1335277621

I would say the real story is that you made something of value vs the free-but-pointless model we read about much more often these days.  You built a business around something valuable with a relatively high price point that makes it less of a victim of the kind of scalability issues that ""general public"" web based services are dealing with.<p>I think the bigger take away would be:
If you make something awesome for the general public that millions of people will be using all day long, plan to work seven days a week 'round the clock and there's no guarantee you'll ever see a penny.  If you come up with something valuable that people would be willing to pay $25-$50 a month for, your life will be much, much more enjoyable and you might actually get to watch your kids grow up and/or have some time left for your hobbies.",1335277557

Sure they overdo it in movies but I have read a fair amount of blogpost and reddit comments that discribe the same problem.<p>There is grouping and groupe think too in Schools here but not in the same extrem way. It could be selection bios on my part but lets look at the diffrents in the schooling system.<p>In Switzerland (most parts) we have 1-2 years of Kindergarden, 6 years of Elementry School and then the people get split up in 3 diffrent section depending on your grade. The lower to only take 3 more years and after them mandatory school is finished and most people start an profecional education via the Dual Education System (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_education_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_education_system</a>). The other way is to go 6 more years and then most people go to a universety.<p>The good parts are that more often then not you put people to gather that go together. The typical movie example where the bull beats up the nerd doesnt really happen. The next positiv thing is that you put people together that are about equal in how fast they learn. The guy who always distracts the class will not hold back the guy who wants to learn. The studends get the matiral in there own speed, thus they don't feel stupid because of the fast learners, witch can be bad for confidence and it can cause social conflicts.<p>The bad is of course that you split up frindships because people go to diffrent schools and you just don't see each other that much anymore. This happend to me and only years later we really start hanging out again. Today kids are much better equiped to deal with this. To other bad thing is that often good studends could help the others.<p>It seams to me spliting up teenagers that are in puberty is good way to avoid social problems.<p>Other opinions why this problem seams worst in the US or is it just selection bias?",1335277470

People respect confidence, even if they hate you. Bullying is an attempt to destroy your confidence while building the bully's confidence in himself by thinking he's the better man for destroying someone weaker than him (and so long as you don't fight back, he's right, btw). Most people get their confidence by herding with other people and mimicking them. It gives them a false sense of security, but it's confidence all the same. Unfortunately, that confidence comes at the price of never being able to be their true selves, and never being able to chase dreams that differ too much from the accepted norm.<p>Individuality and confidence are a potent blend. They breed explorers and free thinkers, poets, philosophers, disruptors, and cross-cultural bridges. They drive a person to blaze a trail of his own, bringing him after many trials and tribulations to doors that open but for a select few.

But I experienced bullying nonethless, because I was shy kid with asthma, that couldn't play football or basketball. And other kids also experienced bullying, because of different reasons.<p>But it stopped when I got to secondary school in bigger city. Just because all the bullies went to worse schools, because they couldn't pass the exam.<p>Also - maybe it's rationalizing, but I think my primary school experience was good for me. At least I hope I won't 
forget what it feels like to be ostracized.<p>EDIT: I think it's very easy for kids that pass their particular school test for coolness (and for their parents), to overlook that some other kids are bullied in their school.<p>It just doesn't seem like a big deal that some people are ""unpopular"". When somebody is comfortable in a class, most bullying techniques won't work on him, and in effect seems harmless to him. Bullying isn't just beating up. Kids are very cruel sometimes, and they use psychical tricks for bullying, too. In my primary school one girl was always laughed off for stinking (I think she did not, really, but it's not the point). Kids made it into a play - they escaped from her, to not be ""infected"" with stinking. To parents - it's just some kids playing. But for that girl it wasn't easy probably. I'm ashamed to this day that I've participated in this, because I've tried to make them stop bullying me. Well, it was a good lesson at least.",1335276999

I didn't learn the 101 little tricks to make interacting with frustrating people that little bit easier, I didn't learn to empathize with people less smart than me and I didn't develop the social intelligence that I believe is vital for long-term success.  Any time I had to interact with anyone I felt terrible and awkward and out of place.  When I went to college I was as alienated and lonely as everyone else had been in high school and I still didn't have casual friends because I didn't know how to be friends with anyone who didn't already share my interests.  I didn't understand letting other people talk in class, or that school was for learning, not achieving things, or that I could make people happy by listening to things I didn't care about (and in the process learn about interesting things I never knew I'd be interested in.)<p>When I got a job I didn't understand that jobs are for collaboration, not just achieving things myself.  Most team jobs work best if members are able and willing to sublimate their egos for the good of the group: I was busy being smart and weird.  I assumed that because I was right everyone else would, of course, agree with me, and so none of my ideas ever got adopted because I didn't know how to enlist people as allies.  I was still super lonely and still hadn't learn how to have casual friends (close friends I always had, one or two, mostly other homeschooled kids, but they were people who could put up with me just the way I was, which was kind of an arrogant asshole.)<p>I eventually sat down and compared myself to people who were less lonely than me and figured out what I could do differently.  I realized that I'd rather not be an asshole than be right.  I developed an understanding of when and how to ask questions, how to work and, yes, fit in with a group while still keeping myself whole.  I learned how to be passionate without being overwhelming.<p>My kids are going to school.  I will fight tooth and nail for a safe environment for them with adults who are on their side and not on the side of the bullies, but I want them to grow up knowing that if you tell your friend to fuck off they will stop being your friend because you are an asshole, not because you are weird.  If you are not enjoyable to interact with people won't be your friend because friendship isn't an entitlement: it's a collaborative project.  It may be that if you find a huge city you can find someone who doesn't mind being told to fuck off, or maybe even who thinks it is cool, but that doesn't mean that prioritizing your weirdness over the comfort of people around you will lead to a fulfilling social life (especially because those people are likely to tell you to fuck off too).  Developing friends will probably have as much to do with how we change and grow as it does with leaving suburbia.<p>Besides, we have the Internet now.  There is no reason kids can't both learn to be part of suburbia and experience the wide world outside of it at the same time.",1335276442

Yet in its current incarnation, it is unfit to do so. Silicon Valley has mastered the art of building high-growth technology companies but iit hasnt yet developed the moral compass to figure out what companies are worth building. There are simply too many talented entrepreneurs today building meaningless ventures. From advertising products that get people to buy things they dont need, to social games that are designed to addict people to wasting their time, to mobile-local-social products that attempt to leverage the latest technological trends without giving much thought to the importance of the problem being solved. Furthermore, the unquenchable thirst for growth that fuels much of the wealth creation must be carefully watched, for it could easily turn malignant and lead technology entrepreneurs to commit the same kind of economic atrocities as the financial sector.""",1335276318

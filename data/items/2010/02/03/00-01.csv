Many of these pro/con arguments fail to take into account the content of the page that is above the fold.  If the content above the fold does not visually lead you to the conclusion that there is content below the fold, users will not go there.<p>I'd bet that many people did not know to scroll down on the author's site because what's above the fold doesn't tell the user that there is content below it.  Had the author, say, moved the text down so that it was bisected by the fold, more readers would scroll.  Things like horizontal lines and paragraph endings just above the fold signal to the user that the page is ""done.""  Other cues, such as bisected text or obviously bisected images, tell the user the opposite.",1265158796

1096731,comment,1096007,1096377,0,0,tolmasky,,,"I believe we are confusing what we are discussing. It does no good to take someone's words out of context and display them in a political-style sound byte, as seems to be the case here. In every one of my posts I have always said that HTML 5 <i>will be</i> strictly better, but that Adobe's CTO was absolutely correct that currently (and unless the trajectory changes in the future too), we will be jettisoned backwards into a world where we have to create multiple versions of things.<p>We're all on the same page here, we want there to be open standards for video on the web, and that standard will be HTML 5. My point to you is that the current method of proselytizing this is preaching to the choir and not effective to the people that matter. If I ran a moderately successful medium traffic website, and I saw what the CTO said, then saw your response, clicked on it, and found that it didn't work on just about every browser, I would have to agree with the CTO, and then I may not bother expending the energy on switching the content on my site. Its simply a matter of fighting this thing intelligently.<p>The situation with the iPhone/iPod Touch not having Flash is not hunky dory. We live in a bubble where we simply don't use Flash that much and think ""what's the big deal"". I am 100% guilty of this myself. I am thrilled Flash is not on the iPhone and I absolutely hate Flash on my computer, exhibit A: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1057673"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1057673</a> . However, I can see that there exist use cases outside of my own experiences: I am not an 11 year old kid that plays Flash games all the time. What's scary to me is that a lot of people say that native SDK apps will fill the void here (as opposed to ""HTML5"").<p>Secondly, the problems with video on the web are still very real and unresolved. Firefox not supporting H.264 is not just some ""bug"", they are religiously against it. They refuse to put it into versions of Firefox that ship to countries where patents are not enforceable. It seems that the emphasis will be on the developer/user to figure out the story with that (just like before it was up to you to install xvid or quicktime or whatever, this is BAD). While we see this as a neat opportunity to tell developers to do it ""the right way"", many business will simply ask ""why if Flash already works... everywhere... today"". And again, no one seems to address the IE issue. If your answer is ""not a problem"", this thing won't get resolved.<p>The big conclusion here is not ""Flash rocks"". Its hey there are some real but tractable problems. Instead of exhausting our energy trying to convince people these problems don't exist or aren't really that much to worry about, lets use it to fix it.",1265158570

Instead Homebrew uses the Perl, Python and Ruby that OSX already provides. (This may be a con, depending on what you think of Apple's treatment of those packages. I grant that.)<p>I found the Python issue to be a particular pain in the ass, since MacPorts's Python build requires tk, which requires some GUI libraries, which ends up building more or less an entire X11 sub-system on OSX <i>that I will never ever use</i>.<p>I ran into this when trying to install Getmail. My solution then was simply to download Getmail and install it the old-fashioned way. I was a little surprised that Getmail built so easily using the system's built-in Python. My first thought was, ""If I can do it that easily, using what I already have, why does MacPorts force me to download and build all this other crap?""<p>What annoys me about MacPorts (which I love in many ways, don't get me wrong) is that it is not easy to customize builds.

Whatever.<p>There _are_ some things that are really wrong. The biggest of these is that Python is slow. This limits where you can use, and pushes developers toward using C libraries. Which can solve the slowness, but tends to make for less stable applications. After all those years with ""Pure Java"", this is a pain I don't feel I should have to endure. I don't care so much about purity, but other languages have managed to be both reliable and somewhat fast...<p>The other thing that bugs me about Python is the arbitrariness of the features. It has beautiful list and generator comprehensions, but weird support for lambdas. It has a ""dicts all the way down"" approach to names, but weird closure bugs. Etc. I've read the ""Zen of Python"" but I still find myself scratching my head.

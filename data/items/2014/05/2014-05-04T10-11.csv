Approaches like Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms are appropriate for situations in which you have no good heuristic for pruning a search tree. They&#x27;re almost always going to be last resort approaches, but at least in the case of SA they generally approximate quickly enough to provide useful results.",1399201191

It counts hashing cycles rather than humans, but it&#x27;s close enough since the final goal is decentralization and not perfect equality. Here proof-of-work or proof-of-stake are also equally necessary for bootstrap purposes; otherwise you can use whatever mechanism nodes use to get into the system in the first place ten thousand times instead of one time and thereby massively magnify your reward.<p>TLDR: proof of voting is a good consensus algorithm, it&#x27;s not a good distribution model.",1399201114

When an item is accessed, it is promoted to the quartile point two back from its current position.<p>I think that makes it clearer that it is essentially a less aggressive LRU; being less aggressive shifts its focus to a longer timescale.<p>It also lets you think about other ways to tweak LRU; what if instead of promoting an item to a particular quarter point, you just moved it up N places in the list? If you set N to three eighths of cache size, that would be roughly equivalent to S4LRU, but with a smoother response. You could then think about varying N according to where the item starts in the list (making it tougher to climb to the very top, say), or according to some other property of the item (making it easier for small items to climb, say).<p>Another way to think about this is that it is 4Q-LRU, but with items that fall off the higher queues being demoted to lower queues, rather than being evicted:<p><a href=""http://www.vldb.org/conf/1994/P439.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vldb.org/conf/1994/P439.PDF</a><p>It&#x27;d be interesting to see a comparison between SnLRU, nQ-LRU, and ARC.

MDN is mostly a wiki, and the underlying codebase for that is all in Python. There&#x27;s also the Demo Studio, which lets people upload web technology demos, and that&#x27;s Python too.<p>But the wiki also has an embedded script-ish language (letting people create macros/templates for specific purposes and re-use them across multiple articles). That&#x27;s JavaScript-based, and so is implemented in node.js. And there&#x27;s a WYSIWYG editor for the wiki pages, which is a couple of MDN-specific plugins we&#x27;ve developed, plus off-the-shelf components (the editor + jQuery, which we also use for a few other things on-site).<p>So MDN is a Python project with a couple JS utilities attached. And if you set up a local copy, you can pretty easily see that Python is by far the heaviest-used language. But due to the way GitHub counts and reports statistics, it shows up as a JavaScript project.<p>To pick on an easy example: the copy of jQuery we have in our repository weighs in at just over 9,000 lines.

If you want an editor that is scriptable with Lisp and supports Textmate bundles, and Vim keybindings; Emacs[0] + Evil mode[1] (Extensible Vi layer, it&#x27;s great) + Yasnippet[2] (Yet annother snippet library, has textmate bundles).<p>I switched from vim to this setup a while ago and have to say I&#x27;ve been very happy with it. I like the advantage of having a full language to use and find the environment more customisable (maybe just because I never got fully comfortable with VimScript. That being said, I still use vim for quickly editing single files as you can&#x27;t beat the startup time.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet</a>",1399198039

They can do that at any altitude.

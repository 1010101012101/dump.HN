4973294,comment,4972854,4972854,5,0,mdkess,,,"I disagree with some of this list. Having never started a company but worked at a few, here's my opinionated and uninformed rant.<p>Picking your own email address and hostname sounds fine in theory, but as the company grows, having a naming scheme like first initial last name lets you email people easily without having to remember the format that they chose. Plus it means that the first few employees get all of the cool email addresses (dave@example.com, etc), and it's hard to change emails down the line.<p>And no vacation policy sounds nice in practice, especially as an employer (we're all adults, be responsible), but it falls apart quickly especially if people are workaholics and don't take vacations. I have trouble taking vacation as it is, with no defined policy, I basically don't. It would be even harder if my boss didn't take vacations. Now, this isn't my employer's fault directly, but I would prefer a defined vacation policy with a no sick day policy (or better yet - ""if you're sick at all, don't come to work or you're fired"") and an understanding of short term tradeoffs for when you do things like pull all nighters.<p>Company credit card is great. I'd even go so far as to say tell every person - here's $500 to spend each year making yourself more productive. Then let people (subject to approval) buy whatever they want.<p>As for a clear salary system - in theory, sounds reasonable, but you have to be flexible with salary since you don't want to lose good developers because your ""culture"" says you can't pay someone an extra $5k/year. And if you start making exceptions, I think that's worse, since it gets perceived as favoritism. At the same time, that salary talk should happen twice a year, no exceptions. There should also be performance reviews every six months, and the performance reviews and salary conversations should not be the same thing (since otherwise I think people will just wait to answer the question of ""am I getting a raise"" and ignore the rest).<p>Quality furniture and office space and pick your own computers - very yes. Again, I'd say - here are some recommended/common setups, but here's $5k (or more) to spend on your office. Also, quiet space is so important, I hate open offices. If you're a small company, you take what you can get, but once you are big, at the very least have pair offices. Distraction due to random noise costs me days of productivity, and I'm generally pretty focused. I have a Herman Miller Embody at work, oh god that chair is awesome.<p>Snacks - I really like free lunches, not for the financial benefit because I figure it comes out of my salary anyway, but because it means I can get healthy food and I don't have to think about it. Also, get healthy office snacks as well as a bit of junk food.<p>Hours - I tend to work in long periods of high productivity followed by long periods of low productivity, so my work hours fluctuate a lot. I have friend however that works at a company that is quite strict about 9:30-6:00pm every day (as in, get in slightly before 9:30 ever day, and everyone is out before 6:00pm), which seems reasonable. I think that in a lot of companies where people are at work for 12 hours a day, they're not doing 12 hours of work but filling time to save face. So having never experienced a more strictly regimented day, I think that it might be interesting.",1356616439

4973276,comment,4972854,4972854,2,0,jfaucett,,,"first, I think this list is a great conception. But personally I've worked in companies and in situations where many on this list were already there. So here's my personal take on several on this list, these are all just my suggestions and thoughts feedback is welcomed, since I'm very interested in building up a good work atmosphere :)<p>1. ""No defined vacation policy"" - you do consider this, but I think it will still be a problem actually making people take time off especially if this is just left up in the air for the developers, as a dev you need time off but you're so consumed with your project and its such a part of you that I find myself never doing this unless I know that I have to take 4 weeks or whatever per year, then I can alot time for it. So I think the ""loose"" idea is good but there probably needs to be a basic timeslot for vacation, or suggestions or something so people don't get burned out.<p>2. ""Company credit card access"" - this is another really good idea, but I'm the type of person that feels uncomfortable with this sort of thing (don't know how others are?). Personally, I'd just like to know that hey, you have such and such amount of money for general courses/books per year, if you don't use it, well ok it doesn't get added to your salary but its always there. I don't know that's just my opinion of what I like. Then I feel comfortable, buying resources that aren't %100 percent work related (say a book on Functional Programming, when all I do is build rails apps).<p>3. ""They pick their computer"" - yes, dead on, this is a must in my opinion, though if someone picked windows I might actually be apt to deny them - jk. Also I might go so far as to say dual or tri wielding with the monitors is a company mandate.<p>4. ""Let them pick their own email address"" - I actually disagree on this one. I think there should be a well defined email schema from the onset such as firstname.lastname@company.com so that you end up with descriptive namespaces for individuals in the company that everyone can remember and looks professional on businesss cards and in to/from headers, not things like cooldever@company.com.<p>5. ""Dedicate time and resources to learning."" - I agree with just about everything here. I would actually even go further though (haven't tried this, its just a thought), and concretely set asside a time, say Friday afternoons, where no one is allowed to work, but its hacking time, where they can work on side-projects or experiment with new things, just so everyone can stay uptodate, work on their own stuff, and head into the weekends with a good relaxed feeling.<p>again great list :)",1356615992

4973204,comment,4971002,4971002,10,0,dmbaggett,,,"Here are some clarifying points on security issues. We wrote up a FAQ for the website, but it's not in the prod version of the site yet. Short version: we really care about this stuff, have worked with cryptography and other security experts, and are happy to explain what we're doing. The analogy to LastPass elsewhere in this thread is apt; our techniques are similar and we'll document what we're doing so you can evaluate them. Here's a thumbnail version:<p>Inky uses SRP (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol</a>) to authenticate to the server that stores your credentials. This means that Inky proves to the server that you know your password without actually sending any bits of the password. Deriving the password from the stored password verifier object is thought to be a computationally hard problem, in a similar (number-theoretic) sense that, say, RSA is thought to be hard to break without knowing the password.<p>Your IMAP/POP passwords and other secure information are encrypted with a key <i>derived from</i> your Inky password. Since we don't know the Inky password, we don't know your IMAP/POP passwords. To add entropy to the encryption key, we use PBKDF2 key stretching. (As an aside: we can't reset your password since we don't know it; that's why we let you set up security question that lets you reset it <i>from that machine only</i>)<p>About not warning about self-signed certificates: this is obviously a trade-off between on-boarding simplicity and security. When you approve connecting to a site (which we tell you involves sending your password), you implicitly accept the site's X.509 certificate if it fails to validate. From that point on, however, we  require the signature to match the certificate you accepted when you added the account; otherwise, we won't connect and we'll put up a warning. I'm personally interested in Tervor Perrin's work on TACK as an alternative to the well-known problems with the TLS trust hierarchy. (These problems have been discussed here extensively.)",1356614350

You lower the rent, because a happy PhD is worth more than $100/month. Yes, even if you don't know him and won't gain anything from it.<p>Another example: You're the personnel at that top university. You agree to be paid less than you deserve so more can afford the education.<p>Another example: You can get in Google because of a friend. But you know someone else more qualified wants the job too. You let him \nhave it. Because it is best for society that everyone gets the job he deserves, and that important jobs are done efficiently, instead of cheating for your own sake.<p>Another example: You know you can increase sales dramatically by using gamification and abusing psychology to get your users addicted to reward mechanisms. You don't do it, because it's best for society that clueless people don't waste their time/resources with bad MMOs and Farmville, despite the interests of your company.<p>Another example: You can get a lot of profit by hiding poor products under shiny overpriced cases, then throwing money at marketing. You don't do it because it's not in the interests of the people.<p>Another example: You don't use your marketing/SEO skills to sell a fancy software which already exists as a superior FOSS alternative.

If you disagree with this statement, use arguments, and good luck. ""Me first"", ""my family first"", ""my company first"", ""my country first"" is not good enough. It's chaos. All the evil in the world rests on these ""good"" intentions. People get slaughtered for the sake of others' families.

It's volatile but the stakes are getting higher and the strategies are getting smarter.<p>The point I think you overlooking is that if Wikileaks is a signing key then it becomes a lot more plausible that the leaked info is contrived and was planted there to achieve a propaganda goal.  Like it or not, human authority structures are somewhat necessary to address issues like that.  To offer a counterexample, Anonymous could be hijacked by the government far more easily than Wikileaks.  I think the ideal social cryptosystem addresses this but does not exist yet, at least at a scale sufficient to have the kind of impact that Wikileaks has had.",1356613263

But a totally anonymous organization on the Internet probably wouldn't have attracted mainstream attention.  I doubt dropping the Pentagon Papers today would have had much effect.  I mean, 99% of what was in the War Files was essentially known to anyone willing to look, and even people with access wouldn't really read most AARs.  It's boring.  The controversy actually made more people look at it than would have if Cryptome had FOIA'd it or the DOD just declassified it.<p>Choosing to do what Jake did (sacrificing his own freedom to promote his agenda) is not something I'd want to do, but we're overall better off that some people are willing to do it.  He's never been as technically accomplished as a lot of hackers (probably including Julian Assange), but more than a lot of others, but has been very effective at getting the Tor message out and generally promoting things.<p>I'd personally rather hang out with people creating technical countermeasures (or, even better, building stuff which is actually expanding human capability, like putting humans on Mars in a decade or extending human lifespan by 20-30 years), but not everyone can do that, and it probably doesn't make sense for everyone to do so.<p>Keynote talks at conferences rarely have technical content, too.<p>Just because a cause is right doesn't mean it doesn't need PR/marketing.",1356613226

Thus why people wore clothing until it was rags. The cost of clothing and all such goods came down dramatically due to peoples&#x27; specialization as spinners, weavers, sewers, tailors, etc. Now clothing is cheap and plentiful.<p>[Update: found it: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8940950"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8940950</a> ]<p>* There was another HN thread discussing the fall of the Roman empire and the &quot;dark ages&quot;. A commentator who seemed to be a historian reinforced the idea that yes, there really was a dark ages. The fall of the empire shut down trade, which led to a marked decline in the pottery available in Britain. Previously they had been able to import plentiful, high quality pottery from elsewhere. With the fall of the empire and the collapse of trade, they began to make it themselves, and were terrible at it. Even the kings of the era had worse pottery than the common person centuries earlier. (This is more about trade than about cities, but the effectiveness of trade increases with density.)<p>[Update: not the HN comment I was looking for, but similar information about pottery: <a href=""http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/1391"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/1391</a> ]<p>The power of specialization and trade",1425761738

You don’t sound harsh, you sound as if you jump to conclusions without enough information. (It would be as accurate if I were to judge your management ability as poor because of your abrasive tone.

How was your due diligence?”<p>You passed petty judgement without paying attention and asking yourself <i>why</i> I would have abbreviated the stories. I expanded on that to try to explain (politely) why your judgement was wrong, and you come back with more abrasiveness and further petty judgement.<p>I know <i>lots</i> of people who have quit jobs or been fired from jobs because of incompetent, petty, micromanagers. But my story wasn’t about them, it was about me. Even in those stories, I am <i>explicitly</i> leaving out lots of information that could identify the companies or people in question (but people who know me or care to look could probably figure most of them out). I’m doing this because outing those people is unnecessary and mean, yet my experience is <i>still</i> worth talking about.<p>The reality is that people can be fired for lots of reasons that have nothing to do with them or their performance on the job. It can be as simple as a personality clash.<p>Did I do anything wrong in the three cases I mentioned? Possibly. In one case, I’m certain I could have approached some things better, but it would not have changed the final equation—the manager in question proposed a substantial technology change (with specious reasoning) not long after he fired me, and that would have been a signal that I was no longer interested in working there.<p>As to the case where the owner of the company is a total moron and the team lead doing something phenomenally stupid–judgements I would still hold now? The team lead was smart, but did a stupid thing by abusing privileges he had been granted.

I don&#x27;t know what all you were about to do with that record, but in this case, you may have been able to use:<p><pre><code>    type Record interface {
        Create() Record
    }
</code></pre>
which declares an interface of things that know how to create another copy of themselves and return it. Well, the type doesn&#x27;t guarantee that the same type will come out but you can document that. Then you don&#x27;t need reflection to create a new instance, as long as you can get an instance of the correct type from somewhere else. You presumably have some arguments that goes in, but it&#x27;s reasonably likely (though not certain) that there&#x27;s some sort of regularity you can exploit and put into the type signature of Create() up there.<p>I&#x27;ve used this pattern myself in a generic &quot;game server&quot; that implements a network protocol and manages creating &quot;rounds&quot; of games and other high-level bookkeeping, where you pass it in a &quot;prototypical&quot; game object that provides a &quot;CreateNew()&quot; method on it, thus making it so the core engine can create new games without ever actually knowing what the game itself is.<p>If it&#x27;s good enough for Haskell it&#x27;s good enough for Go.<p>(Haskell, a bit confusingly, calls this a Proxy, perhaps because the instance is standing in as a proxy for the type? I was never quite sure where the name came from.)<p>I&#x27;ve actually written quite a bit of Go now without needing reflection, and the only &quot;interface{}&quot;s in the system are either A: things that legitimately can be &quot;anything&quot; (on a per-instance basis, i.e., not ATDs that really want to just have one type in them but legitimately on an object-by-object basis may contain an &quot;anything&quot;) or B: things I really want to say are &quot;encodable/decodable as JSON by the standard encoding/json library but there&#x27;s no clear way to say that in the type&quot;. The latter annoys me in theory a great deal more than it annoys me in practice.<p>Mind you, I acknowledge there&#x27;s a point where you&#x27;ll be left with no other options but an interface{} or reflection, but people do end up reaching for it more quickly than is strictly speaking necessary. And it isn&#x27;t necessarily a compliment for Go that it makes you think a bit harder for this sort of thing.",1425760660

Wealth is easier to accumulate in a city because there is far more specialization.<p>I can&#x27;t be a first-rate baker and a blacksmith and a shipwright and a miner and a fisher and a farmer and and and ... the specialists in the city do one thing excellently: they bring down the cost while also bringing up quality, raising quality-of-life for people in the city. If I&#x27;m an average farmer and average blacksmith, perhaps I&#x27;ll produce $10 worth of goods in an hour, $5 worth of crops and $5 worth of tools. As an exceptional farmer, I can produce $20 worth of crops, trade $10 of them for tools, and end up with $10 each of crops and tools. It&#x27;s as simple as that - trading between people with different specialties / needs leaves both people better off, and you can&#x27;t do that subsistence farming.<p>Public infrastructure in cities has also always been much better, such as roads, communication systems, police, fire fighting, etc. Trade was much easier because there were more people to trade with, a larger market for your goods. On a small subsistence farm, any excess that you cannot save or reinvest is wasted; in a city, it can be sold or traded to accumulate wealth.<p>There are certainly people who are attracted to the city because they can&#x27;t hack it (beggars, etc.), but they are in the minority. In the modern era, something like 3% of the population are farmers, and they are so exceptionally effective (supported by agricultural scientists, robotics engineers who build automated farming machinery, etc.) that the rest of us have plenty of food, freeing us up to specialize in other things (like robotics).<p>I believe this cycle of technological enrichment fundamentally requires specialization. This is not to say that anyone is wrong for wanting a simpler or more communal form of living, but I doubt the motivations are anything economic. The reason that so many people end up working in cities, in factories (sweatshops) today is simple: they can accumulate more wealth specializing in even a mundane repetitive task (quickly, cheaply, and with quality) than they could by subsistence farming.",1425760522

We can always pick the individual situations apart and say &#x27;they made the following 50 mistakes, and that is why they are un- or under-employed&#x27;, but if we look at the trends, we can see it&#x27;s bigger than that. We have overlapping crises of credentialism; jobs that aren&#x27;t there - even for many people with STEM degrees; underpaid and overworked adjuncts that require food stamps to live; people who go to school until they are in their mid-30s, sometimes later, and walk out with a pile of degrees and no marketable skills outside of academia, and cannot get jobs IN academia; skyrocketing tuitions; and an enormous bubble of debt (now over 1T.)

People who aren’t pulling their weight get fired. But there are plenty of workers who do just fine, Brady said.</i><p>EDIT: If you downvote, at least write down why.",1425758788

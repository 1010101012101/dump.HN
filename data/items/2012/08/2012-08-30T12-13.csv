I greatly appreciate this feedback.<p>I'm targeting a niche market with this, but I'm not quite sure about the level that I should be talking to them. On one hand, it's easy to assume they know a fair bit about the data that the power meter they spent a couple of thousand dollars on produces, so I don't need to explain what everything is. On the other hand, that's probably a dangerous assumption that often isn't true, so the more explanation I give, the better.

You would be throwing out most of the Netscape 4.0 way of doing things, and you'd eventually want to learn things like closures and Javascript's occasionally-annoying ""everything is a global variable by default"" and so on.

But since the numbers are random between 0 to 999, that averages to 500 requests per chunk. Additionally, you don't have to do any kind of port checking for the last chunk, so that saves on any overhead you might have for the port checks.

4454310,comment,4454044,4454172,3,0,jcr,,,"thanks thaumaturgy. I took my typical ""make the problem simple"" approach
and replaced the function contents with:<p><pre><code>  function displayx() {
    alert(""Hello Nurse!"");
  }
</code></pre>
By the name change you can see my first guess was the name 'display()'
might be causing the problem.<p>As for Colin's question about for searching for this kind of stuff, it
helps to make the problem smaller and more isolated (""bifurcation"" is
the more typical/pedantic way to say it). In this case you could search
on the very first step, the [onclick], find a working example, and
see if you can get the example to run properly.<p><pre><code>  <button onclick=""alert('Hello Nurse!');"">Click Me</button>
</code></pre>
If it doesn't work, then you probably have a script blocker 
or popup blocker problem... or in my typical case, I've mistyped
something important. ;)<p>From there, find a simple example of calling a function from onclick, and see
if you it to run properly. If it works, then compare your code to the example.
If the simple example doesn't work, then you might have a bad example, or
you mistyped something, or there might be something odd in your browser config,
or you've just found a bug in your browser, or ... --keep trying to simplify and
isolate the problem.<p>The trouble with javascript searching and finding examples is finding bad examples.
They're everywhere. The volume of bad JS code on the web is just staggering, but
the worst parts are ancient, outdated and broken code still hanging around, and the
existence of countless hacks to get around browser bugs/differences. The hacks can
often <i>look</i> like horridly bad code, but sadly, they exist for a reason and they
are seldom explained.",1346330815

There were a couple of ways to deal with this.<p>For the first chunk, a diff of 2 meant the first chunk server returned false, as the change in port #s meant no other network traffic had occurred between the primary server's request and reporting false from the chunk server. The chunk servers were called synchronously, so if the first chunk was correct and the second chunk server returned false, the difference would (ideally) be three. It's easy to see how a high network load would cause a lot of jitter here.<p>Some in IRC suggested the best way to reduce jitter was to improve the processing speed of the successive curl calls by using a faster language, such as C. My initial script was in Ruby, which felt qualitatively slower than Python, so I was stymied by jitter too. (I started out rejecting 2 in 10, and it got progressively worse.) I simply checked back every one in a while. By Monday night, the server was either empty or Stripe had increased processor resources, so 9/10 of my calls were effective.",1346329581

You're using a very old (Netscape 4.0-era I think) way of referencing form elements in the DOM that apparently isn't supported anymore.<p>Add an id=""results"" attribute to the text box, then change the line in your display() function to this:<p><pre><code>    document.getElementById('results').value = ""test""
</code></pre>
That works for me.",1346328365

- People don't scroll. It wasn't obvious to me that there was more info below the fold.
- You need a strong call-to-action on the front page.
- Put this demo ride link above the fold, because showing the product is great: <a href=""http://www.cyclinganalytics.com/ride/897403933578"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cyclinganalytics.com/ride/897403933578</a>

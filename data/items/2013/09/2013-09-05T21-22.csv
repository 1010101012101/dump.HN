What attack have they actually succeeded in?<p>The backdooring of proprietary products is interesting, if not surprising. It&#x27;s good to see it come to light.

Limit poker is fairly well solved by bots at this stage. This is because the risk is limited on each hand and the grinding nature of the computer (i.e. it&#x27;s ability to do the best thing for the longest amount of time) makes it a winner. 
Playing no-limit poker, it&#x27;s a totally different scenario and a real challenge which is why I enjoyed it so much. Any slip up can cost you your entire stack. By slip up I don&#x27;t mean a bug or clicking the wrong button, I mean a flaw in your strategy. Maybe something as simple as betting 4 big blinds instead of 3 big blinds pre-flop against a raise from a player will end up after a couple of rounds of betting of being played for your entire stack, instead of being something you could fold on the turn. 
Anyway, long story short. Limit poker is very solvable just by enumerating the various possible outcomes. 
No-limit cash poker is a different beast, it&#x27;s exponentially harder than limit poker. It&#x27;ll be a long time before somebody solves no-limit cash games.",1378416502

There are two reasons that the color scheme on the front page is so bright (and to some folks, ugly).<p>First, we wanted to make it really obvious what&#x27;s going on, and if we&#x27;d used a subtle color gradient, it wouldn&#x27;t have been as obvious. We realize that many/most people won&#x27;t ultimately use the bright color scheme for one reason or another.<p>The second point is that people perceive color differently, so what is bright to one person may not seem so bright to someone else. There tend to be age-related correlations/causes here--it&#x27;s why old people tend to wear lots of bright blues. To them, the blues don&#x27;t look as bright. What we&#x27;ve found is that younger folks tend like the more subtle colors (eyes are more sensitive) and older folks tend to like the brighter colors (because they can&#x27;t perceive the color difference in the subtle schemes). We anticipate rolling out our product/feature with a color picker palette so that users can choose the right color scheme for their visual physiology.<p>Thanks again for all the comments and suggestions, and please feel free to email us through the website if you have an app/site that you&#x27;d like to use BeeLine with.

Even Krahulik himself thinks so[1]. When he says, on the one hand, &quot;We have worked very hard to make PAX a safe place,&quot; and then, on the other hand, says he regrets not selling rape joke t-shirts that specifically were released to antagonize his critics (the ones he was making the safe place for). What&#x27;s up with that?<p>I think the t-shirt was purposefully created to make fun of people who thought the original comic was a big deal. Do you disagree? It&#x27;s not about whether the original comic was sexist (I never said that, nor did Wired).<p>I also think there&#x27;s a clear difference between PA selling the shirt and Wired writing a reaction piece.

But the more Rob talked, the more I thought the idea was a total hoax.<p>For example, in Rhinehart&#x27;s blog post &quot;How I Stopped Eating Food&quot;[0], he writes:<p><pre><code>  My physique has noticeably improved, my skin is clearer, my
  teeth whiter, my hair thicker and my dandruff gone. My
  resting heart rate is lower, I haven&#x27;t felt the least bit 
  sickly, rare for me this time of year. I&#x27;ve had a common 
  skin condition called Keratosis Pilaris since birth. That 
  was gone by day 9. I used to run less than a mile at the 
  gym, now I can run 7. I have more energy than I know what to
  do with. On day 4 I caught myself balancing on the curb and
  jumping on and off the sidewalk when crossing the street like
  I used to do when I was a kid. People gave me strange looks but
  I just smiled back. Even my scars look better.&quot;
</code></pre>
I think the only ailment he forgot to mention was his inoperable cancer that had disappeared by day 10 (sarcasm). On a serious note, after I read this, I realized that Rob was going into full marketing mode. He had talked about releasing the recipe for Soylent in on of his first posts, but I realized now that he wanted to build as much hype as possible so he could commercialize his idea. Mind you, there is nothing wrong with that, but I now felt a degree of skepticism towards the whole thing, because his incentive structure was changing. For goodness sakes, he&#x27;s claiming that his endurance increased 7x simply by switching to Soylent.<p>It is probably not fair for me to judge the entire project based on this blog post, but I have yet to see anyone claim that Soylent did the above for them, especially after 30 days.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://robrhinehart.com/?p=298"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robrhinehart.com/?p=298</a>",1378415564

I figured they were just an example, but I was slightly worried that your knowledge of California might be derived entirely from Hollywood. ;)<p>The good thing about volcanoes is that you do get a certain amount of warning, these days, before the big one comes.

94723,comment,94616,94668,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Permit me to ramble for a bit.<p>There is no idea so great that a one-sentence description, made by a stranger, will cause me to send an email asking for more. There are too many scammers, cranks, and clueless people in the world. There are too many people who have no idea how hard it is to complete a successful project. There are too many people who are looking for something for nothing.<p>Of course, you folks are strangers, and yet you got me to give you some design advice -- twice! But you did quite a bit of work for this ""free"" advice -- you had to build an entire prototype site and post a link to it. <i>That</i> is the kind of presentation -- a working, criticizable prototype -- that might get people interested in joining a random project. It's a lot more than one sentence.<p>Read this essay:<p><a href=""http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2005/05/08/finding_discord_in_harmony"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2005/05/08/finding_discord_in_h...</a><p>and this more recent one, that cites it:<p><a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001017.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001017.html</a><p>Other than providing working code -- or extensive mockups, or a detailed written proposal, or a compelling story -- the easiest way to get me interested in a collaboration is to get me interested in <i>you</i>. I don't care if you plan to cure cancer -- I want to know who you are, first. That takes time, and it takes words.<p>So, if people are going to meet and start collaborations on your site, you need to give them lots of room to converse, to get to know each other. You need to give them long comment threads and rambling discussions. (Like, um, news.yc. Score one for PG's design sense.) If you don't feel like building an entire social network (and you probably shouldn't) you need to encourage people to introduce themselves with links to Facebook, or LinkedIn, or their own blogs, or something. And you need to encourage them to put as much flesh on the bones of their proposals as they can -- because nothing attracts builders like something that's already half built.<p>As it stands, my fear is that your site just doesn't have enough <i>words</i>. Whitespace looks clean and professional, but it doesn't tell me what the site is for, and it doesn't tell me what the individual projects are about.<p>EDIT: changed the link to the first essay to the one that I really wanted to cite. :)",1199424429

In some ""terms and service"" listing I'm sure they state that using the service means they can do X, Y, Z with your data. You agree to it implicitly.<p>But talk of rights on private property and abusive terms is ridiculous for a service based company. The whole point is to make something users wants.

94720,comment,94702,94715,0,0,jsnx,,,"Technically speaking, the TOS allows Google to kick any <i>user</i> who gets their stuff from Facebook This would be bad for Facebook, but it would be bad for Google and Yahoo, too: they would anger their users by frustrating a reasonable use of their service. Those users might just take their email and leave.<p>Is the same true for Facebook? If you get kicked from Facebook, where else will you go? You might say ""I'll just take my friends and start my own Facebook!"", but you won't be able to unless you somehow got around their monitoring. (Not a difficult problem in principal, but tough for the non-savvy.)<p>Would a service that exports Facebook contacts be illegal? What about a piece of software that does so?",1199423933

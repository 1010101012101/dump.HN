They're smart, nice folks and they deeply understand what their customers are looking for in dedicated hosting.  I've traded emails in the middle of the night with their CEO, called support and gotten resolution to nightmare issues in a matter of a few minutes, sent them sharp criticisms on their forums to find the issues fixed weeks later.  They're not perfect -- I think you'd be better off elsewhere if you really need to lean on them for system administration tasks -- but if you want boxes, power, and network, they're great.",1199923029

It may hurt a bit at first, but it's much better for you in the long run, providing you don't annoy everyone by continually letting them know...",1199922900

96599,comment,96413,96413,0,0,zach,,,"Really, this should be a <i>mea culpa</i>, but instead it's a rant.  Dreamhost was too ambitious in trying to offer Rails hosting given their legacy infrastructure.  And now they're punting.<p>So why did they support RoR to begin with?  ""Ruby on Rails seemed to really fit in with our company philosophy and we thought our existing customer base would love it.""  Okay guys, so what have you learned here?",1199922589
96598,comment,96461,96520,0,0,robg,,,"A fun, informative feature could be that list for each user in their profile. Even better if it updates based on use - how the hivemind splinters into the specific bees. There's so much that could be done there - similar users, related posts, discovery. I'm surprised we have yet to see that basic functionality in the more nebulous news sites.",1199922289

96596,comment,96492,96511,0,0,skmurphy,,,"""In many cases, it's still much easier to decrease cost than increase revenue.""<p>It's also a more reliable sales focus, especially in an uncertain economy, to attack a cost stream that is real. Future revenues are a possibility, costs, especially recurring costs, are a tangible reality.",1199922206
96595,comment,96413,96413,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"While I agree that RoR is pretty damned hard to use in a shared environment, I'll point out that it is definitely possible.  It took Jamie a couple of weeks to get it all spinning...but Virtualmin can spawn mongrels, configure load balancing in Apache, and still keep it all running as the user (making it safe for shared hosting environments).  Several of our customers have it deployed...and while the load of the RoR stack is significantly higher than PHP (or Perl/Python) under mod_fcgid, it can be done safely.",1199921981

96588,comment,96374,96374,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We (Virtualmin) have two boxes at The Planet, who we've always been happy with, a couple of Amazon EC2 instances, and we're about to try a box at LiquidWeb (maybe...I'm still shopping around).  We also have an account at SourceForge.net for our Open Source stuff.  Given that we're pushing out over two terabytes a month in downloads, not paying for it is good.<p>ServerBeach has always provided good service to me in the past.<p>Joyent are really smart guys, and their Accelerators are a good deal.

96586,comment,96457,96457,0,0,ashu,,,"Alignment is broken. The title does not align with anything else. Similarly for the three boxes (featured lists, etc.) - they don't align with the title, etc. Just put things in a simple (invisible) grid and everything might just look much better.<p>Also, the list-details page is very crowded. When I go to the list-details page, I am interested in <i>that</i> list, not everything else. The left and right columns could easily have expandable boxes (unopened by default) for Popular, Featured lists, etc.",1199921175

96584,comment,96423,96516,0,0,brent,,,"Poor analogy.  These are, for all intensive purposes, tools for mutually exclusive tasks.  Programming languages are in general for the purpose of writing programs.  While they may different slightly in capabilities they are for one purpose.  A ""better"" (IMHO) analogy along those lines would being choosing a handsaw, bandsaw, circular saw, or kitchen knife.",1199920913

96580,comment,96374,96385,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"If saving $100 (or even $200, or $300) on hosting is your competitive advantage, you're in serious trouble.  Don't get me wrong, I believe startups should be frugal to the point of comedy, but being secretive about who you host with is just silly (if someone wants to know, they can find out, anyway...IP addresses contain a lot of information).",1199920645

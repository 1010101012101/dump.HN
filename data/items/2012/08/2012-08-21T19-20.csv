[and I doubt a good one exists]"" instead of ""I don't see any reason why someone shouldn't make this. [and I would like to hear some]""<<<<p>Ah I see. I'll start qualifying my I-don't-see-any-reason-whys from now on with the latter statement. :)<p>>>> I will admit that I do not know much about it, but what I do know is that there were some failures (as you would expect) and the public did not react well.<<<<p>I guess that's the real reason why this won't be implemented by government agencies. Space missions are a matter of national pride and no one wants a ""designed to fail/waste of money"" accusation on their hands. However, empirically speaking it seems to be the best way to do things as we can increase the amount of explored area quite rapidly and respond to changes much more quickly. I think that when private companies such as Planetary Resources start doing exploration they will be forced to adopt this model because of their constraints and a lot of amazing solutions will come out of it. If that happens then it might open up a pandora's box and advances will happen much more quickly. Some people will see it as a bad thing, but as long as the systems are autonomous it should lead to a lot of good things.<p>>>> 2) the public will not tolerate failure on large NASA projects, even if those projects cost a fraction of what it takes to host an Olympics, or to buy Instagram, or fight a war for a day.<<<<p>More importantly the politician who approves it probably won't get re-elected.<p>>>> [2] And yet, JPL still chose to use the skycrane. Very courageous.<<<<p>I was quite shocked when I heard it worked. I was willing to bet on the side of failure because of the sheer complexity involved. A small timing error, sensor glitch or the other million things that could have gone wrong would have led to failure. It's quite impressive that they managed to do such a high stakes real-time task more or less autonomously. It really was quite a daring thing.<p>>>>your idea<<<<p>It's definitely not mine. I bet people were talking about it when I was in diapers.<p>>>> What I meant by my line of questioning was that I haven't seen an implementation of these concepts outside academia, even though the idea has been around for some time, and the industry isn't entirely driven by irrational beings, so there must be some technical reasons why the ideas haven't been fully adopted.<<<<p>Yes, I'm willing to bet that this has a lethal flaw which quickly led to such implementations to be rejected, but the question is can this be hacked, for the lack of a better word? Remember most organisations where rovers are designed are meant to be risk averse and they, aside from NASA, have an endless pool of resources to draw from. (I'm talking about the military) The sociological and resource incentives in place simply work against any such proposal independent of engineering viability.<p>>>> His argument that most failures were systematic, and not due to unequal 'wear' of various kinds. <<<<p>There's an interesting case to be made over here, one is redundancy at the unit level and another is redundancy at the systemic level. Let's take the swarm as a system, in that case if you have multiple backup copies of machines adept at performing particular tasks then you essentially have redundancy provided that the same method is <i>not</i> followed at the unit level. In that case if one failed for a particular set of inputs (hardware or software) then you can ""patch"" the rest by either avoiding the physical situation or changing the software. You can repeat that with individual units and let them have free reign. If one of them gets destroyed then the other ought to be able to be modified in time. Although it won't guard against stupidity at the unit level, this should to be a much more redundant system than anything we can create within a single one-use device.<p>At the level of the single unit, systematic failures come into play and more copies is actually less over there. Things must be asymmetrically designed to overcome edge cases and systematic failure modes and robust engineering makes sense over there. I think that one of the best ways to implement such a system would be to spend most of the resources in creating and testing a mobile base which is independent of its payload. (attachable modules which perform specific tasks) You should then be able to deploy this machine across missions and learn from all of the real world testing in each mission to create something truly robust and reliable. Once you achieve that you can start offering redundancy at the swarm level through the payloads.  For example in that high gain, low gain antenna scenario, wouldn't it be better to have a dozen robots equipped with a variety of antennas dedicated to communication?<p>>>> It's when the designs and tests don't match reality is when the problems happen. <<<<p>Yes, but isn't the entire point of the exercise to fail early and fail often so that you can succeed? If your system is disposable then any systemic failure becomes yet another data point to engineer against and all future systems are better because of it. There is no better laboratory than nature and surely this is a point in favour of it? (unless I'm missing something)<p>Would you like to carry out this convo via email?

As far as I can tell, apprenticeships and co-ops don't scale today. Interesting if they could.<p>I don't think it harms Udacity to run both - a free tier for people to get their feet wet in CS and explore through a lifetime of learning, and a pro tier that gives the equivalent of a Master of Science with certificate (ie, classes only, no thesis). The free tier allows unlimited retries, has no deadlines, and encourages self-learning. But the pro tier separates the wheat from the chaff a bit, is strict on identity, is strict on plagiarism, gives one-try test grades, and has a minimum bar for certification.<p>You could probably make the divide between free and pro in a much different manner than I just did. I think I gave a pretty old-school university way of thinking about the problem. Of course they are not confined to think this way.<p>The materials for both tiers could be very close to each other, to the point where it would be wasteful to separate instruction. That's why liberal education and professional education get smushed together into higher learning today. Maybe Udacity can separate out these two in an interesting way.",1345578659

Go look at the iFixit write-ups of taking apart recent Apple devices, which helpfully show exactly how similar/different the variations are in many respects, highlight all kinds of proprietary components literally down to the level of unusual screws that have no apparent benefit whatsoever over using a standard/compatible component, and incidentally debunk your claim about ""substantial thickness and weight savings"" in the process.<p><i>it's actually just people preferring the non-modular systems for many reasons</i><p>I'm still waiting for anyone to cite any of those reasons. Other things being equal, why would someone prefer to buy a system that was going to cost a vast amount more to repair in the event of screen damage, or where proprietary connectors meant they couldn't swap out the SSD for a higher capacity unit even though the device itself is actually removable? And as noted above, for the most part other things <i>are</i> in fact equal, or so close as makes no difference.<p><i>then giving an example where you yourself went for junk instead of something that's supposedly like what you want</i><p>I'm still waiting for anyone to tell me what I should have bought instead. As I said, the printer I was talking about there was very much not an entry-level device, it was pitched as part of a range for professional use in an office, and with a price tag to match. Asking for such a printer to print a black-and-white document with only black toner is not some sort of absurd concession or flippant request. There would be no excuse for nerfing a $150 printer in that way, never mind a $1,500 one.<p>Also, it's not as if I somehow found the only printer or the only printer manufacturer around who has this problem. Again, as I already said, almost everyone seems to work this way these days. If you insist on maintaining that after extensive research I still wound up buying ""junk"" unnecessarily, you can easily win this debate. All you have to do is cite an alternative device I could have bought, with a reasonably similar spec and for a similar budget, that does not have such artificial limitations. But you can't, and instead of accepting that, you persist in implying that it's somehow my fault that a world class brand deliberately nerfed a device that costs $1,000+ in order to increase their revenue on consumables.",1345577953

    <li class=""item-template"">
      <a href=""#"" class=""item-link-template""><strong class=""item-caption-template"">Some dummy caption</strong></a>
        &mdash; <span class=""item-description-standin"">Some dummy description</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</code></pre>
The <i>item-template</i> marks the outer-most element to use for repetition. The <i>item-link-template</i> can be used to set the href attribute. The contents of the tag marked with <i>item-caption-template</i> will be replaced with whatever content. The <i>item-description-standin</i> gets replaced with content outright. If you, say, want to remove the <strong> tags around the caption, just move the templating class to the parent item.<p><pre><code>  <ul>
    <li class=""item-template"">
      <a href=""#"" class=""item-link-template item-caption-template"">Some dummy caption</a>
        &mdash; <span class=""item-description-standin"">Some dummy description</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</code></pre>
If you come up with some conventions, e.g. ""-standin"" gets replaced completely, whereas ""-template"" just gets transformed; each marker is only used for one purpose (don't conflate the link and the caption marker in the latter example), it works rather well, probably better than any other templating system I've used.<p>My only gripes with Enlive at the time were that it was overly macro-heavy (def'ing everything as opposed to returning values), and loading templates was quite slow, which made on-the-fly modifications to HTML generated elsewhere ineffecient. I suspect both are better these days, as it was still heavily in development at the time.",1345577556

4414292,comment,4411491,4413862,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Excellent. I generate lots and lots of communications every day and find that being misread is a way to score my effectiveness. Paul Graham points out that his essays can't really have pages of footnotes to cover all the possible interpretations of the writing and he is correct. We strive to make it understandable to the widest possible audience and go from there.<p>I suggest you really closely examine this thought :<p><i>""The reality is they are working for a company that desires to increase their bottom line just like any other business-- as they should. My point is because of this, the ecosystem is click driven. Which means a much greater frequency of startups will be covered. Which means even if a startup is doing nothing new and the technology is rather unimpressive, the brand attached to it means clicks ($$) so it gets coverage.""</i><p>There is a whole lot of assumption going on in there, and while you do have to assume some things [1] its not true that you can assume all things. To check yourself you can try to reason your way from first principles to the conclusion that you expressed above.<p>You can stipulate that businesses want to be profitable. Some will argue with that saying some businesses are non-profits but the point is sufficiently accepted that you can get away with just stipulating it. Then you claim based on that one stipulation that the desire for profit makes the business ""click driven."" That bit of reasoning is weak, on what basis can you claim that the only source of revenue for the web site is ""clicks""? And I'll assume you mean advertising clicks but how does that manifest here? The issue isn't that your claim isn't credible in the small, you can say 'Techcrunch is supported entirely by ad share revenue generated by the click through rate on its pages' (and cite some reference for this), but you cannot generalize and say 'all people who write about technology' live or die by the clicks they get on their blog. I will give you a really clear example,<p>Robin Harris writes the Storage Mojo blog (<a href=""http://storagemojo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://storagemojo.com/</a>) where he talks about trends in the storage industry and the various players. He has advertisements on his blog, but he doesn't live or die by them, rather he lives on being a consultant to folks who want to tap into his wisdom about the storage industry. That wisdom comes from putting in the hours watching the industry. He doesn't care if you don't read his blog, but he does care that Tom Georgens (CEO of Netapp) does. But more importantly to this discussion he is a good example that your assumption about the relationship between tech writers and money, <i>as a generalization</i>, is invalid.<p>Walking through your own reasoning can be a great way of figuring out if you are 'fooling yourself' or are really on to something. You know others will demand you defend your viewpoint so having done the home work you are prepared to engage right away. Then you jump into this:<p><i>""When this is done at such a frequency, the greater the likelihood the companies that are doing dynamic things fall through the cracks-- creating a lower standard that isn't producing optimal results of what the space is capable of.""</i><p>This is a pretty classic move. It reads like you have convinced yourself that the reason you haven't found folks who talk about these innovative startups is because all tech journalists are click driven, and thus 'the space' is not performing as efficiently as it could.<p>The challenge though is that your reasoning is counter to about 200 years of free market research starting with Adam Smith. It would be safer to start with the assumption that free markets work and are efficient and thus if you're not seeing the content out there that you would expect, you should dig into why that is. (hint: it isn't because the techno-journalists are click whores)<p>Last bit as this is getting too long, this one:<p><i>""And the only way to fully keep intact the integrity of this blog without question is to not monetize. This is a hobby for me. Startups are my passion and I like to write. I love giving product deep thought-""</i><p>Integrity comes from the author, not from the money (or lack thereof, I know people with no money and no integrity). Great to make a statement of your principles on your blog somewhere and actually stick to them. Do that long enough and people will believe you.  The rest of this statement is pure gold, you are passionate about startups and you like to think deeply about them. So go forth and do that, write your pen dry as my grandfather once said. Don't over think it. There is a good chance nobody will care, but in your passion you will find reward (one of the ways I tell people they can discriminate between true passion and one that isn't, is people engaged in their true passion don't care at all if nobody else cares, just the doing is so wonderful that they do it.) If you cannot be passionate in a blog nobody reads, then perhaps its not really your passion after all. You will get lots of chances to talk to people and all of that research and thinking will give you a chance to make insightful observations and eventually, folks might seek out what other things you written, but it starts with you just following your passion not really caring if anyone else cares.<p>[1] There is a funny joke about a wife talking to her mathematician friend about commitment while driving around in the car. She says ""You won't agree to anything, like there is a house painted white in this neighborhood, see there is one right over there.""

You can easily translate an exact type into a corresponding XML encoding and know the type of what you're getting out on the other end. JSON on the other hand is duck typing in web service form. You can shove any data structure in on one end, and get it back out the other end, without writing any custom code, and without actually knowing the type of the data you've sent. You could say that JSON itself is weakly typed.<p>The popularity of JSON is tied to the popularity of weak typing. You can more rapidly iterate your API design and codebase without those bothersome types getting in the way. The flip side of that is the end result isn't ""done done"". It lacks full validation of input and it lacks complete documentation. In short it's more difficult to use and more prone to bugs and security issues.

The brilliance from the commerce standpoint is that the freebie is by definition minimized by the number of shirts sold, and a typical loser product will see more activity than usual. From a customer standpoint, you have effectively 20% chance of getting a freebie, making the perceived purchase price 80% of $25, or $20, a very reasonable price for a graphic t-shirt. However, since it's the least purchased number getting freebies, I'd expect your actual revenue to be more like $21 per shirt, thus creating profit out of thin air. Customer pays a decent marginal price (for a hopefully quality product), you get a built-in profit from the mechanics, and the game mechanics nearly guarantee a larger volume of purchases than normal.

Most big budget games right now are made for the current crop of consoles which PCs outpaced years ago. Too many times the PC version is just the 360 version with UI changes to support the mouse and keyboard. You can look at the graphics mods that are being made for games such as Skyrim and GTA4 to see the wasted potential.<p>Also, it's really, really expensive (as you point out) to make a game that truly pushes the capabilities we have right now and very few developers are willing to do that, it's a huge risk. Part of UnrealEngine4's development are attempts to address this by providing tools to help reduce the time necessary with the creation process.<p>But not all games need high graphic fidelity, that's not the whole story.

There will always be better solutions invented to existing problems. And solving problems experienced by a lot of people, and solving them well, will always be worth a lot of money.<p>I run a 20-person webapp design and development consultancy, with employees all over the US and no central office. Group communication is a constant problem for us: we use Campfire rooms for most project communication, but frequently have to drop into Skype for ad-hoc video calls. I wind up in Google Chat several times a day with employees and clients as well. Campfire is great for realtime-ish team conversations, but if you want to ask a question like ""hey, anyone want to go in on a house for SXSW?"" you're probably better off sending an email if you want everyone to see it and have a chance to respond. We keep a lot of company docs in Google Docs, stuff which would really be more useful in the company wiki we don't have setup currently. I could go on, but the gist is that our communication tools for project teams, the company, clients, and 1-on-1 conversations are pretty fragmented.<p>Theoretically Yammer should solve this problem. It doesn't. We've experimented with it in the past, and it's a poor fit in a thousand tiny ways.

The plateau is around a 2.5ghz dual core that supports the bangs and whistles when appropriate, be they branch prediction or atomic math or layered caches.  The laptop space is now <i>getting</i> there, the tablet space is still 2 years out from that, and Desktops hit it 4 years ago.  The reason is that the Desktop system could push out 125 watt cpus consistently without a hitch.  Today, the real inroads in the Desktop space are not in core count (which nothing consumer grade saturates) frequency (which hit the ceiling on Silicon) or ""cheats"" (using transistors to accelerate instruction handling) they are coming out in significantly lower TDP demands.  The modern i7 chip runs at 77 watts where the 920 in the article runs at 130 watts.<p>Meanwhile, laptops are maintaining their 20 - 40 watt profiles but are gaining performance.  They are converging to that low power threshold.  The tablet space is even lower, down to 5 watts in some cases, averaging from 3 to 10, but still, that is a convergence point.<p>It also doesn't hurt that AMD tripped over their own feet for a while and Intel is resting on its laurels pumping out higher performant CPUs without AMD to compete with at the high end.<p>Meanwhile, the graphics card business <i>is</i> heating up, the 7000 and 600 cards are upwards of 30 - 40% faster than the previous generation at much lower TDP, the Kepler architecture is extremely vector processing optimized to a fault in that it is worse as a gpgpu device than the 500 series, while the AMD Southern Islands chips are very generic cores optimized for GPGPU when their last few generations were graphics optmized, but in both regards they are markedly higher performant and consume much less power than many older gpus.<p>The advances are still there, they are just going in divergent directions.  Nothing is stopping Intel from making a 32 core i7 with hyperthreading on a 500mm die besides the heat associated costs and tremendous production costs, but nothing on the market would utilize that.  So they invest elsewhere.<p>The next generation of consoles isn't looking so bright either - they all seem to be targeting AMD gpus, and the WiiU will probably be using a modified 68X0 and the Sony / Microsoft camps will use the 78XX cards.  They even are considering using FPUs.

What's the difference, syntactically, between a convention and a specialized structure?<p>XML <i>is</i> Lisp. In fact, the XML grammar and Lisp's grammar are (almost) homomorphic[1]. SXML is a trivial mapping of XML to s-expressions which demonstrates this.<p>There's no point in comparing XML and S-expressions like that; they're essentially the same thing!<p>If you're talking about internal representation, well, that's up to the compiler. But since you have to declare the format either explicitly or by context, there's no 'advantage' of XML over s-expressions.<p>[1] To be pedantic, XML is homomorphic to SXML, which is a subset of the Lisp grammar, but that just means that Lisp recognizes some strings that aren't in the XML grammar, so if anything, Lisp is more powerful, but that's beside the point.",1345575683

Customers buy the router with the firewall to hook up multiple computers, they don't care about the security. You could argue that they should hire a security consultant to educate them on the need for a stateful firewall when setting up their home network, but you would be smoking crack.",1345575679

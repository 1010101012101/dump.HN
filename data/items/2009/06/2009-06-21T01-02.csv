For eg, Peldi has a post about it here (http://www.balsamiq.com/blog/2008/10/14/personal-whats-your-story-why-start-balsamiq/). Similarly, I'm sure it will be really helpful for aspiring entrepreneurs to get insights from the early days of smaller, more normal startups (mom and pop shops on the internet). Hope it makes sense. Thanks.",1245549584

Yammering endlessly about their ""legacy"", less than 24 hours after their passing, is not okay, particularly if you're vilifying their memory. That wouldn't be right even if it was a relatively hated public figure, and certainly not for a guy that was just a chronic Usenet poster.<p>Look, I get it. I concede your point that he said a lot of things that shouldn't have been said.<p>But you and kragen are basically being trolls now, and if you claim to be the ones who have some respect for empathy and civil discourse, you'll just zip it.",1245549478

Equality is the right choice nearly all the time.<p>I've worked on some very large web apps (mostly C#, Python and PHP) and I can't recall ever really being foiled by php's implicit casting.<p>Just out of genuine curiousity, can you share an example where this caused a problem that you had to debug?<p>And if php implicit casting did somehow cause you problems, surely it was fixed by changing it from equality to identity?<p>So in summary... this could potentially cause a bug, but probably not, and if it does, it would be a consistent bug, and it would be fixed by a single keystroke.<p>Why, again, are we talking about this?",1245548289

667025,comment,666611,666611,0,0,CodeMage,,,"<i>A brief summary, then: Remove the syntactic mess that is attributes.  (You will
then find that you do not need them at all.)  Enclose the /element/ in matching
delimiters, not the tag.  These simple things makes people think differently
about how they use the language.  Contrary to the foolish notion that syntax is
immaterial, people optimize the way they express themselves, and so express
themselves differently with different syntaxes.  Next, introduce macros that
look exactly like elements, but that are expanded in place between the reader
and the ""object model"".</i><p>Maybe I'm weird, but to me (this part) sounds like LISP.",1245548252

They ""contacted Apple Europe"" who ""seemed excited"" and they considered that an assurance worth spending money on developing the software and purchasing licenses?  It almost sounds like they emailed someone they know at Apple about what they were planning on doing, who responded ""Nice...sounds cool.""

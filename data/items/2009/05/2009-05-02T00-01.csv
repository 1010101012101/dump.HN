To do this, they will consider working with other carriers and creating different models of the product. One model will have more features and one will have less. When will this happen?

Or, rather, CPU cache will become very large and be the primary storage and (M)RAM will be the secondary storage.<p>In either case, given that CPU cache is (designed to be) transparent, the whole computing landscape will be irrevocably altered.<p>Think about it... what would a computing environment look like if it was based around a system in which all your data and code was just as instantly addressable and accessible as all your other data and code, and it was just ONE address space?",1241225491

A hardware compatibility issue[1] made me go back to Ubuntu Server, but I came away with two main impressions:<p>1) It's actually pretty easy to install, once you get past the whole ""it's different"" bit. I had no real trouble.<p>2) Updating/upgrading is a PITA. Having to upgrade by patching source code -- WTF?<p>What do you do if you have a fleet of 100s of OpenBSD machines? I may be spoiled by apt, but I can upgrade the several hundred machines I'm responsible for in an almost trivial manner. (And updating a single machine with apt is absolutely trivial.) That doesn't seem to be possible with OpenBSD. (I suppose you could write a custom shell script to do the update, and distribute that to your machines, but...certainly not trivial.)<p>What's more, I would be willing (if not completely comfortable) to update a remote Ubuntu/Debian box to the next release -- that doesn't seem like a good idea (or even possible under some circumstances) with OpenBSD.<p>This seems even stranger when you consider the security reputation of OpenBSD, and how important updates are for security, even for something as well-audited and well-written as OpenBSD.<p>Am I missing something here?<p>[1] <a href=""http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/openbsd-misc/2009/2/8/4924074"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/openbsd-misc/2009/2/8/4924...</a>",1241224723

Affiliate programs can be a very profitable way to gain customers, but there are lots of issues that come up. In particular:<p>-Before your product is listed on an affiliate network, you need to put down a significant investment- mid to high $XX,XXX as a prepayment to the network<p>-Especially for a webapp, there could be issues of rampant fraud-affilites using VCCs to sign up and so on- this is something you will need to be proactive about filtering out<p>-Products that do well on affiliate networks have a large target market- if your webapp is niche affiliates won't bother to take the time to set up campaigns to promote your product",1241224718

I'd need to study it not just read it.<p>Presumably there is some distance from my current mental state vector to any with a comfortable grasp of Bayesian probability, and some explanations will take a quick route and some a less direct one.

The internet collectively hoards and archives insane amounts of information, so it's a lot to dig through, but sources are often still there somewhere, and they are often copied verbatim.<p>A big part of history has always been gathering and interpreting sources, to figure out the validity of assertions like that (whether contemporary or retroactive).

This makes them a great bargain because their paycheck is not nearly proportional with their quality.<p>If all the best people were aware of how good they actually are, they'd have a really hard time finding a job where they wouldn't feel underpaid.

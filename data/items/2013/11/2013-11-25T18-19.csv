6796098,comment,6794437,6795630,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"FYI I like tort law but am not a lawyer, just a law school dropout. My view is that liability depends on the degree to which the manufacturer was in a position to be aware of the risks, and also on the relative ability of the consumer to discern such risks.<p>To take the latter point first, drug consumers are generally in a poor position to evaluate the risks of a given medication. If I set up a wheel manufacturing business, and sell square wheels, you are in a poor position to complain about the resulting bumpy ride [1] because the superiority of round wheels is so glaringly obvious. Unless you hold a medical or pharmaceutical degree, though, your ability to evaluate a drug&#x27;s safety and efficacy is probably very limited. I&#x27;m smart enough to read and get the gist of a biochemistry paper to have an idea of what a drug does, but nowhere near knowledgeable enough to review or spot all but the most egregious errors. So while I am the sort of person who reads all the fine print on drug labels and sometimes digs into the academic research, in the end I&#x27;m taking a great deal on faith whenever I take medicine. by contrast, the drug manufacturer has not just one biochemical expert, but whole teams of them. This certainly puts them in the best position to foresee and even look for potential problems.<p>Now back to the first point: drug discovery is not the exact science we&#x27;d like it to be due to the gaps in our knowledge. Accordingly, drug companies must be given some leeway, compared to other manufacturers who enjoy a greater degree of foreseeability. suppose I set up a ladder company, but the ladders I manufacture employ such thin metal rungs that they cannot bear any weight above 100 pounds. They look good enough, but soon consumers begin suffering accidents when using them. I could not claim the accidents were unforeseeable since the tensile properties of metals are so well known and the tests are so easy to perform, that I should have realized the risk when <i>designing</i> my product, never mind before shipping it! It would be unfair to hold drug manufacturers to that degree of liability, but on the other hand a) experimental protocols exist precisely to address this problem and are widely understood within the drug industry, and b) since DES was on sale from 1941 onwards and class action lawsuits were brought against manufacturers in the late 1960s, more than enough time had elapsed for industry participants to have apprised themselves of the risk and limited the risk to consumers to a greater extent than they did.<p>If you read Judge Mosk&#x27;s opinion, in footnote 24 [2] he summarizes a 7-point test for establishing (rather than allocating) liability. The answer you seek is there:<p><pre><code>  The suggested requirements are as follows:\n  1. There existed an insufficient, industry-wide standard of safety as to the manufacture of the product.\n  2. Plaintiff is not at fault for the absence of evidence identifying the causative agent but, rather, this absence of proof is due to defendant&#x27;s conduct.\n  3. A generically similar defective product was manufactured by all the defendants.\n  4. Plaintiff&#x27;s injury was caused by this defect.\n  5. Defendants owed a duty to the class of which plaintiff was a member.\n  6. There is clear and convincing evidence that plaintiff&#x27;s injury was caused by a product made by one of the defendants. For example, the joined defendants accounted for a high percentage of such defective products on the market at the time of plaintiff&#x27;s injury.\n  7. All defendants were tortfeasors.\n</code></pre>\nThis is a very brief abstraction of a key theory in a law review article written by a student at Fordham University, referred to in the opinion as &#x27;the Fordham comment.&#x27; This unusually influential article [3] basically sets out a whole theory of &#x27;enterprise liability&#x27; and damages allocation addressing why the manufacturers should share liability in the context of the DES in much greater detail, although it&#x27;s rather painful to read for people who are not legal nerds as it approaches some sort of footnote event horizon. Whether the <i>Sindell</i> court&#x27;s findings allow the legal academy to be held liable for typographically-induced brain trauma remains unresolved.<p>1. <a href=\"http://dogknobit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/square-wheel.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dogknobit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/square-wheel...</a><p>2. <a href=\"http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/26C3d588.htm#SA000885\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/26C3d588.htm#SA000885</a><p>3. <a href=\"http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2314&context=flr\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=231...</a>",1385405898

6796095,comment,6794860,6795950,4,0,jacalata,,,"That&#x27;s a well stated argument, and it&#x27;s definitely true that you can&#x27;t look at the tech industry in a vacuum. But I think it would be very difficult to argue both that US/Western/California society is sexist in a way that prevents women from entering the field, and also that all the men that entered the field have magically freed themselves from the sexist cultural biases and attitudes of the larger society they grew up in.<p>Also, in this scenario, even if the tech industry is not actively sexist, it is being affected by the sexism of the wider society - and, if you think there is anything wrong with that (eg decreased pool of potential employees/founders/idea people), then it is quite possible to make tech-industry-specific moves that counter the extra disadvantages imposed from outside the industry, like affirmative action programs for girls that give them increased access to the tools that will allow them to forge their merit, even when you can&#x27;t quite identify the process that is reducing their access in the first place. In fact I think that for a field which prides itself on solving big problems, saying &#x27;it&#x27;s not us it&#x27;s the rest of society&#x27; is a cop-out, and to agree with your statement and <i>not</i> support affirmative action in some form is equivalent to supporting entrenched sexism.",1385405868

I mean, did people thing these purchases were done as a Pokemon game?  &quot;Yay, Google got all 151 verticals!&quot;.  How long did they let Blogger sit as a wasteland of spam?<p>Now?

Obviously, Plus has problems, and lots of them.  It&#x27;s far too opinionated for something that&#x27;s being used as a general-purpose comment-engine.  Plus is a good Facebook, but it&#x27;s a piss-poor Disqus, and Google is using it as Disqus.<p>But the overall strategy of consolidation?  Long overdue.<p>Google is finally turning their holdings into a single impressive platform instead of a balkanized mess of isolated services.<p>I don&#x27;t like the privacy implications, of course.

But if, as I suspect, you have given a lot of thought to the medical, statistical, and visual side of this, but are not well-read in the research on information display, I hope my suggestions will be helpful.<p>- I would recommend being very careful with the wording. One can have too much &quot;food&quot; but &quot;nutrition&quot; has positive connotations and no lay person would speak of &quot;too much nutrition&quot; or &quot;too much environment&quot;.<p>- Please read the experimental material on information display. People study these things and polar display is very poor for picking outliers and recognizing patterns relative to almost any other option, including just printing numbers next to labels with no graph.<p>- For building &quot;interactive&quot; data displays, please read Bret Victor&#x27;s &quot;Magic Ink&quot;, specifically the section on the evil of requiring interaction to display information. [1] One of the problems of the circular layout is that 18 is about as many items as can fit, thus you need interactions to see more data. With most other displays of this data, you could easily fit far more information into one, interaction-free display, which could even be printed out for use in a wider variety of contexts.<p>- You could also use the clearer display to show actual numerical labels or trends over time. (Surely someone with high but declining blood pressure should appear different than someone with high and increasing blood pressure.)<p>- Finally, I am very curious about the decision to include the same set of metrics for everyone and to display them as a single graph. Some of these metrics belong together on one scale, some belong on separate scales, some belong only on people with specific conditions, etc.<p>- Are you planning to do a controlled test of this against other high-level patient summaries? Obviously my guess is that this graph and its interactions would fare worse than a one-sentence textual description provided by a past doctor. &quot;Patient is a well-dressed and intelligent elderly man, with a successful history of controlling his diabetes through diet and exercise, but still showing signs of hypertension&quot; seems to me much better than a graph with conditions: red that requires zooming in to see the word &quot;diabetes&quot; and LDL right on the edge that requires zooming in to see a declining trend over time.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/#interactivity_considered_harmful\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/#interactivity_considered_har...</a>",1385405648

This has real effect on mortgage.<p>The rules around the market are different, too. For example, in California most houses are sold and bought as-is. In Japan, the seller is on the hook for up to an year for problems that weren&#x27;t discovered at the point of sale.<p>These differences depress the existing house market, and that is made up by the new house market, which in turn translates into a lot more new houses.<p>I find this report from Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism highly educational.

Nobody wants to live in these areas, so with reduced demand come lower prices.<p>A 2,000 square-foot home costs $100k in rural Montana and $1M in Southern California because millions of people want to live in SoCal, and relatively few people want to live in rural Montana. Housing prices in Detroit are low because the job market in Detroit has been cratering for decades while crime has been increasing. A home with a seaside view is worth more than a similarly proportioned home abutting a freeway, because people would rather look at the former than the latter. A home in San Francisco is worth a fortune because lots of people with lots of money want to live here, but the inventory (supply) is limited. Etc.<p>Plenty of factors in real estate pricing are highly irrational. With few exceptions, location isn&#x27;t one of them. When people pay for location, they&#x27;re not paying for the house <i>on</i> that location; they&#x27;re paying for the location itself. That&#x27;s why comparing X square feet in Y area to X square feet in Z area isn&#x27;t apples to apples.",1385403290

6795715,comment,6794860,6795644,1,0,icegreentea,,,"Maybe. So there are two branch points for this, and one little thing first.<p>Firstly, I don&#x27;t think anyone ever thinks that those traits can only be found in men. It&#x27;s just that they believe that its more likely men to have those traits. Like the chopstick example I gave, no one is ever going to say only asians use chopsticks, and if you told them that the person in question was actually white, they likely wouldn&#x27;t bat an eye. But their first guess would be asian. So it&#x27;s not really a problem, because that situation doesn&#x27;t really exist.<p>But say we adjust and say the problem is that people think its more common for men to have those traits. Then:<p>A) Someone comes up with a very good way of measuring those traits. Say it actually turns out to be pretty objective and repeatable and consistent. And then they go out into the field and test a representative sample of North Americans. And then they find that amongst North American men and women, men do score higher in those traits by meaningful measurements of &quot;higher&quot; (say both a higher mean, and an asymmetric distribution shifted towards the higher end).<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying that that&#x27;s true, nor do I want that to be true. But if it -is- true, then it turns out people are right! Their intuition matches reality. Now what? Maybe the problem is that its actually true, and we have to dwelve into nature vs nurture and all that &quot;good&quot; stuff. And this is honestly something we have to consider. Given the self-reinforcing nature of society/cultural pressures, and the non-trivial possibility that there are actual biological differences that will bias the traits of the genders, it&#x27;s actually possible that some sort of difference could be found.<p>B) Same thing as above regarding reliable tests, but the tests come out negative. No meaningful differences between genders. Well then yes, we have a problem.",1385403054

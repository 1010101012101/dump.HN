Normally our success or failure at choosing good names is kept hidden, and can only be seen by those who look at our code.

This will teach you techniques you won't commonly see anywhere else.<p>I wouldn't say you <i>need</i> to learn one of these, but I wouldn't say you <i>need</i> to know Matlab, or Lisp/Scheme either. Just that learning different programming styles will make you a better programmer. Prolog and Erlang reputedly have this property as well, but they're still in my to-learn queue, so I can't speak first hand about them.<p>Also, unless you never plan on going near the web, JavaScript is pretty much a necessity these days.",1209347169

175192,comment,174410,174410,0,0,poepping,,,"""We should remember that not all time is interchangeable; just because you're up to spending 4 hours zonked out watching TV in bed does not mean you are up for spending 4 hours doing useful cognitive work.""  --phaedrus<p>This statement is somewhat wrong.  I gave up T.V. about 3 years ago and this may have been true at first, but as you go on you realize that when you feel tired you are usually just bored, and need to do something.  If you are really tired then go to sleep, don't stay awake forcing yourself to be entertained (gorging when you eat?)<p>It isn't Just T.V. that is bad.  Anything that updates is bad since you come back over and over looking for a new fix of ""something new""; I've found this activity extremely draining on your ability to go out and do new things; you drop into a mode of wanting to do to a mode of just wanting things to come to you to entertain you.   This means that the internet is almost as bad as T.V. (if not worse, more content to surf around)   Think of all the things that are currently popular : myspace, youtube, stumble, facebook..etc.. Almost exactly like T.V.  People go to those sites to zone out and have information handed to them.  The same goes for email, people keep checking their mailboxes hoping to have a new nugget of joy that will keep them busy for a few more minutes.<p>I started off With No T.V. (cold turkey), I used Movies to supplement the cravings, then I started cutting back on movies, not because I was trying to cut back on them, but because I just don't find them interesting any more.  Next I cut out all forms of gossip and news from the internet.  Pretty much anything that you read that can make you angry from either a) ""how stupid"" the person writing it is, or b) how anything like ""that"" could ever happen, you just need to cut it out; why do you want to work yourself up?  This would include sites like slashdot.org, digg, reddit..etc.  After cutting these sites out, my over all mood has become much better; those sites just contain thoughts that do you know good what so ever. (How did I read this to be posting on it?  Someone sent me the link.  Which is a great system; if something is worth knowing, someone will tell you.)    After giving up most every news site (they are all tripe that just spread gossip and violence.)  I started reading just ""creative"" blogs (make magazine for example.)  Recently I have found that It doesn't matter what you read, since you'll end up just going back to be ""entertained"".  Why is this bad?  Because you switch off, you might think to yourself that you'll get inspired by reading inspiring blogs, but you won't. What you'll find out if you are paying attention is that most blogs are just recycled content over and over; there are very few original ideas out there.<p>After giving up almost all forms of ""updating"" sources.  I have found that I no longer have enough time in a day to do all the stuff I want to get done.  If I feel too tired even to read a book (not usable energy as someone stated.) then I go to bed.<p>There are millions of things to do out there, you just need to find them.<p>One other mistake I made was when trying to learn a lot of new things I would bounce around between them, which isn't bad, but I found that when I got stuck learning something new, I would switch over to doing something else, which is bad.  So If you plan on learning new things, set a time for yourself.  If you start an activity stay with it for at least 1 hour (or whatever) to make sure that if you hit a wall you work your way over it instead of moving on to something else.  Also, I have found that keep a journal of all the things you learn to be very useful.  Whenever you have some free time, you can read through the past things you have learned to refresh your memory.<p>You can respond to this comment all you want, but as stated i've pretty much given up this type of entrainment (blogs) altogether and I'm just here because someone sent me the link; I wrote this in hopes that it may help some people that are moving down this path already.  If you think this was all dumb crap (maybe it is, life systems change over your life.) , well then don't use it.  If you have any questions: matt.poepping@gmail.com",1209346640
175191,comment,174859,175173,0,0,wheels,,,"We're getting pretty far from the original statement, but you've got some decent questions, so I'll go for it.<p>In your atheism example, you're correct.  And the term racism is emotive; it's something that most people don't want to be even if the common definition describes their view.  Assuming some races to be genetically inferior is what many would term racism.  But what if it's true?<p>So, that brings me to the second part of your question.  There are a lot of angles to look at this from, so I'll just pick the couple that are most important to me.<p>Let's start with history of dominant world civilizations.  I'll pick an easy example:  The Arab world.  It was dominant intellectually, militarily and culturally in the European dark ages.  Italian culture had fallen from dominance to backwardness in about the same time frame.  If we're to assume that the critical factor was genetic, and that Europeans had a genetic change in that period that affected the whole of Europe, which in its rise had very little genetic cross-polination, you would need nigh-on miraculous perfection in genetic propagation for the whole of the population of Northern Europe to receive that gene in a couple hundred years.  Simultaneously, you would need the whole of the Arab population to devolve.<p>If the thesis were that some families have a higher disposition to intelligence, that becomes very defensible.  On the scale of populations of entire continents consisting of millions of individuals spread out over thousands of kilometers in largely distinct gene pools, it's virtually impossible.<p>You might be able to salvage an argument for there being just enough evolution in certain ruling families for it to tip the scales, but that's not very convincing to me, and doesn't leave you with the ""differences between people"" result either.<p>To be clear, I'm not saying that some ethnic groups may not have be genetically predisposed to certain physical or mental capabilities, but that those differences are not significant enough to explain the political tides of human history.<p>The less scientific part of my argument comes from experience.  What are the most important factors in being successful in business?  Drive?  Connections?  Understanding of markets?  There are a lot of things, but most of them are en-cultured values.  I've traveled through Africa, stayed with families, and met a lot of rather intelligent people.  Many of them were still poor.  The difference between me and them wasn't that they had The Dumb African Gene, but that I was born into a upper-middle-class family in the United States, and they were born into blue-collar families in Zimbabwe.  My extended family also has some adopted members that are black.  They most likely came from poor parents.  They turned out about like the rest of us, went to the same colleges, grad schools, got good jobs and so on.  Could they have had genetically weaker genes than the rest of us?  Maybe, but that didn't seem to be terribly important to their level of societal integration.<p>It's pretty seductive to be able to think of the world's socio-economic problems in terms of genetic disposition; it makes us feel like our politics and policies don't play a decisive role and that our civilization is secured forever in its greatness.  For me at least, history and experience do not concur.",1209346478

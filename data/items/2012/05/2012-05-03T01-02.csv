3922042,comment,3921052,3921452,1,0,blahblahblah,,,"In addition to the inter-rater reliability issue, there are also a lot of unanswered questions about the statistical distributions involved.  The results are reported as population means, but without information about the underlying distribution of the results it's unclear whether the mean is a meaningful measure of central tendency for the data or how much overlap there was in the distributions.  How did the mean compare with the median and mode?  What were the standard deviations?  Interquartile range?  They're using a visual analog scale for the ranking which is reasonable, but it seems that it's just been assumed that the data can be treated as interval data for the analysis and the validity of that assumption hasn't been established.  If I were doing the analysis I'd have been inclined to bin the data and report the results as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (e.g. people wearing glasses are N + or - 95% CI times more likely to be regarded as ""smart"", where ""smart"" is defined as a score >= some reasonable threshold on the ""smartness"" axis than those without glasses).",1336010068

Simultaneously the presenter gets to see the augmented image on a nearby wall by way of the projector part (like a portable green-screen).

3921990,comment,3912573,3917754,1,0,dkarl,,,"What I remember people complaining about in the 90s was that UIs were unstable and it was really hard to get X set up at all.  Any complaints they had about UI design were muffled by the tears of joy they shed when they finally saw the black X on the screen instead of junk and patterns.  But in all seriousness, I'm not against innovation at all.  I'd just like to hear about some innovation aimed at existing Linux users rather than insisting that the users who <i>really</i> matter are the casual, non-techie users necessary for mainstream desktop adoption.<p>Targeting ""casual"" users has resulted in some valuable work such as better stability and completeness in many programs, simpler configuration interfaces for many things (such as wireless configuration GUIs that were better than Windows'), and better support for multimedia.  However (leaving aside the fact that those were all things that techie users were begging for anyway) there was a downside.  Customizability and configuration options disappeared.  People made assumptions about ""normal"" users that implicitly labeled a large chunk of the Linux community abnormal.  Case in point:  if you configured your wireless connection using NetworkManager and then switched to a different desktop environment, your wireless connection might not work anymore.  That might sound like a bug, but it wasn't.  It wasn't designed to work that way.  How could that be considered remotely acceptable?  Because normal people don't use alternative desktop environments.  (Thankfully, I've since read that NetworkManager accepts plugins that write to the correct system configuration files, though I don't know if distros test and install them.)<p>And where's the payoff?  What was the payoff supposed to be, anyway?  Back in the nineties and early 2000s many people assumed Linux had to make it on the mainstream desktop in order to be successful, but I think we've put that that misconception behind us.  Yet people still hold up the ""casual user"" as the gold standard that Linux is supposed to cater to, as if it were a moral imperative.  Few Linux users fit that stereotype.  It isn't that we're concretely knowledgeable about Linux.  If you put ten randomly chosen Linux users in a room, chances are that for every component of a running Linux system there will be somebody in the room who is utterly unfamiliar with how it works or how to configure it.  Obviously we should cater to ignorance, if only so we have the luxury of remaining ignorant ourselves.  But there is a general savoir faire with computers that it is acceptable to assume.  By savoir faire I mean whatever factor it is that explains why I am the person in my family who always gets a call on the phone when someone needs help with Windows 7.  Even though I've never developed on Windows, haven't used Windows for anything more than e-mail, web browsing, and Office in ten years, even though I haven't used Windows personally in six months, <i>even though I've never used Windows 7 or Vista at all.</i>  They still ask me for help with Windows 7, and usually I can help them.<p>All I'm saying is that it's acceptable for Linux UI designers to assume that the people using their UIs are likely to resemble current and past Linux users.  Take a break from innovating for projected, postulated, hoped-for users.  Innovate for the ones we already have instead.",1336008656

3921966,comment,3920758,3921601,2,0,Silhouette,,,"There seems to be a parallel with other warranty/consumer protection laws here.<p>In the UK, for example, we have laws like the Sale of Goods Act, under which anything you buy firsthand must meet certain criteria such as being fit for the purpose it was sold for. If it isn't, you are typically entitled to a repair/replacement/refund. However, that need not necessarily be a full refund or replacement with a brand new equivalent, depending on the circumstances.<p>Typically, if a physical product is found to be faulty within six months of purchase, the onus is on the merchant to prove that it was not faulty when it was bought. After that, the burden shifts somewhat, but the merchant can still be liable for fixing a problem even a few years after the original purchase if the item would normally be expected to last that long. As time goes by, the amount of a refund you might be entitled to receive if the product breaks and isn't be repaired or replaced instead would tend to diminish, to reflect the value you have already received from the use of the product before it broke.<p>Usually, in physical product world, a court could make a fair determination of how long something might reasonably be expected to last based on the general market, the original purchase price, etc. Of course with software it's harder, because bits don't magically break, but on the other hand there are platform compatibility issues to consider.<p>As you say, that raises the question of what is a reasonable expected lifetime. If we're talking about pure content -- an e-book, music, a movie, etc. -- then I would argue the answer is ""forever"". If someone has paid for the content, in the expectation that it was a full purchase and not for example a rental or all-you-can-watch fixed-time subscription, then there is simply no excuse for ever deactivating the product after the purchase.<p>If we're talking about executable code in an application, then I would argue that the answer must be <i>as a minimum</i> ""as long as the supporting platform is available"", where by supporting platform I mean the device/OS/etc. necessary to run the code, and not including any sort of artificial dependency introduced exclusively or primarily for the purpose of allowing the software to be disabled in the future. If there is a legitimate dependency on some system outside the consumer's personal control, for example a centralised server used to co-ordinate a multiplayer game and operated at the game developer's expense, then I wouldn't have a problem with a system whereby the dependency was OK but anyone who wanted to maintain the usual legal protections for software would have to leave in escrow a version of the software that allowed third party systems to replace such dependencies if and when the original systems ceased to be available.",1336007941

- otoh, if you're on a cash basis (i.e., you record income when you receive it), which is far more common for small biz, then you never recorded the income for that unpaid invoice, so attempting to write it off will get you in big trouble with the IRS (or the equivalent in the Great White North).",1336007879

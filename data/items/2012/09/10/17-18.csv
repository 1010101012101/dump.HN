But if you're great, you steal the fundamental idea <i>and do something totally new with it.</i><p>Apple didn't just copy the phones already on the market, they stole the idea of a cellphone and did something fundamentally different.<p>So different that we had 6 months of people saying it was going to be a failure, Ballmer going on the record saying there's no way they'd sell any significant numbers, and the RIM engineers telling upper management that the iPhone couldn't possibly work the way apple said!<p>Thats ""stealing"" -- doing something for which there is nothing comparable on the market, in Steve Jobs view.<p>Copying is when you look at a successful product and mimic it down to the millimeter.",1347299962

4501041,comment,4499689,4499816,2,0,shinratdr,,,"Why? From what I can tell it's just a 10-foot interface shoehorned into the existing version of Steam. I don't think anyone was waiting for this. Why would they be? It doesn't solve the principal issues, like why would I game at a crappier second PC that I have to separately maintain just to have the benefit of the couch?<p>Why would I put my good desktop in the living room just so I can use a controller in a more traditional environment? I can use a KB/mouse and a controller at my desk or in bed. Steam isn't going to magically be able to bring the graphical quality and versatility of the PC (which are it's primary benefits) to the living room without being forced to sacrifice most of it.<p>The dev time spent on this would have been much better used as an investment towards a home streaming technology. The Steam box should be an OnLive mircoconsole that uses your desktop PC running Steam as the server. It's perfectly possible, Apple does that exact thing via AirPlay except it uses your iPhone as the server. Try Real Racing 2 on a 1080p AppleTV, your doubts about the technology should vanish.<p>As it stands, this isn't notable news for anyone unless you're the type to be willing to build and maintain two gaming PCs just so you can play in two different rooms. If you are that type, something tells me lack of a 10-foot interface wasn't the obstacle in your way.<p>Either that, or be willing to compromise on graphical quality and versatility pretty heavily to get a cut down PC with standardized specs that you can put in the living room for cheaper...<p>...Wait, isn't that just a console?",1347299504

I think what you really looking for is some advice on how to cope.<p>When you're unemployed, you find yourself with a lot of freetime, and hence, a lot of time to waste. If you have the financial means and are physically capable start traveling. between now and october is one of the peak seasons for cheap airline tickets to just about anywhere, if you don't know where to go, hover over to <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/earthporn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/earthporn</a> (SFW btw, not that you have one now, haha, j/ks) and start browsing. Get some friends (or just go by yourself) and just go. My favorite is Zion National Park. I find that under the starlit sky, without lights or cell reception I find it relaxing and then you'll be able to think about why you got laid off, what you liked or didn't like about your previous job and what you could have possibly done in the past to prevent yourself from getting fired.<p>The most important thing is to just keep moving, rewrite your resume, watch some comedies, reconnect with your family and friends and possibly, make new ones, make a schedule and pack it with so many things to do that you're tired each and every night starting from today. I could go on, but I hope you get it. The second most important thing to do is to not get angry and take it out on your friends and family, what happened to you is truly unfortunate, but getting mad doesn't really help anyone.<p>So peace out, and I hope to see you in the future at another job kicking ass at what you do best.<p>btw, unemployment benefits are okay, but b/c the economy is bad, plan for the long-term, like cancelling your monthly bills, aka netflix (you don't got time for that shit anyways), etc.",1347299228

To be honest, I've never noticed the JVM startup time...<p>But there is another way! Clojure inherits the concepts of SLIME/SWANK from the world of LISP. Essentially, since functions (not objects) are the top-level constructs in Clojure, you can redefine functions at any time while your program is running, and everything will ""magically"" start using the new definition.<p>So, the typical way one develops in Clojure is to start a SWANK or nREPL server, then load their program files into this server. At that point, you can run any single function or if you're writing a web app, for example, you can run the function that starts the web server, hit a URL, edit a function, re-evaluate, reload the web site and immediately see the results.<p>ClojureScript One is one example of how this can be taken advantage of.

Due to your feedback and outstanding account performance, PayPal will no longer temporarily hold your funds in the event of a dispute, claim, or chargeback. These processes used to require funds to be held in a pending balance while the outcome was determined. Going forward, your funds will not be held in a pending balance.<p>Please be aware that we still need your assistance by responding accordingly in a timely fashion, and that the dispute, claim and chargeback process will remain the same. Although PayPal is not placing a temporary hold on your funds, a lost dispute, claim, or chargeback will still result in your PayPal account being debited at the time the case is closed. Please note there are other transactions that can still result in funds being temporarily held and this new change only applies to claims, chargebacks and disputes.<p>Your account performance will consistently be monitored and the terms of this feature are subject to change based on your selling performance. In order to maintain this feature, above-standard performance is necessary. PayPal sends system-generated e-mails which may cause you to see references to held funds in e-mails, disputes, claims, and chargebacks.

They can also use remote direct memory access (RDMA) to do cool stuff like let CUDA applications directly access GPU memory accross the network (GPUDirect).<p>Scientific applications which involve a lot of interprocess communication -- for example, large CFD simulations -- can get a lot of benefits, especially since the popular MPI implementations are highly tuned for those types of apps.

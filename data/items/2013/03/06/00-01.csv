I found that if you were doing snapshots of website states and the memory footprint was significant then the browser just wasnt able to handle displaying all of them at once. I know this is an issue kinda for chrome, but I figure Firefox might have a similar problem. And single page/MVC javascript apps are only going to get more demanding.",1362531555

It doesn't result in a ton of brittle tests that can't survive an upgrade or massive change in the API that is already enough trouble to manage on the implementation-side- even though there may be no functional changes!<p>Some other thoughts:<p>Unit tests that test trivial methods are evil because the LOC count goes up (maintenance anyone?) and the number of entry points and NPE possibilities or checks goes up (bugs anyone?) -> TDD promotes testing trivial methods -> TDD promotes evil<p>TDD increases the chance that more people will mock, and mocking can lead to brittle tests -> TDD increases the chance many of these brittle tests will be written -> Lots of brittle tests means that you throw them away later or rewrite the whole app (with more tests!)<p>TDD promotes 100% test coverage of the code you write -> Very, very few successful companies have 100% test coverage -> Code with 100% test coverage has brittle tests (period) -> TDD promotes things that are not best-of-breed practices in a quest for the false god of 100% test coverage.<p>I was a firm believer in what Kent Beck, Ron Jeffries, et al were pushing in the early part of the last decade. But since then I think most of the rest of the world already knows that TDD practiced religiously will lead to huge amounts of code that slow... down... development... and... make... it... easier... to... buffer... estimates... because when absolutely required you can stop TDD and just hack a spike into production. And... when the application needs to be rewritten because it is too crazy complicated to change all of those tests- you just rewrite it, and we all love greenfield development!",1362531547

ZetaLisp, having been built to implement the Lisp Machine OS in, had some low-level features that made this kind of thing doable, but those features did not make it into Common Lisp (I'm thinking of displaced arrays with mixed element sizes, though as I write this it occurs to me that it might be possible to coax an open source CL implementation into dealing with this, if you can give up on the generated code being portable CL).<p>If you want to look at Zeta-C, the sources and some commentary can be found here: <a href=""http://wiki.alu.org/Zeta-C"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.alu.org/Zeta-C</a>",1362531206

5328586,comment,5328324,5328324,15,0,dangrossman,,,"Is Google allowed to disclose the number of FISA requests it gets? I was under the impression NSLs were being used much less since the PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act (2005) weakened them, and were largely replaced by obtaining secret warrants from the FISA court.<p>FISA is scarier. Under that law, secret surveillance can begin before a warrant is issued, warrants are issued by judges who keep no records of their opinions made in complete secret, and the surveillance can continue even during a challenge over and appeals of that warrant. When the EFF made a FOIA request for information about the FISA court, it got an ominous response: a letter saying there were documents they'd never see, zero court records, and a completely redacted version of an investigation into FISA's constitutionality. By completely redacted, I mean they returned pages where every word on every line was blanked.<p>The only difference is that a FISA warrant has to be connected to a foreign person or body in some way. That can be as little as ""we think by wiretapping this American, we'll learn something about this organization in another country"". For those not living in the US, it means Google/Facebook/Microsoft/etc. can be compelled to surveil your communication through their service secretly without an NSL.",1362531000

It's not like you can distinguish ""superb"" from ""peerless"" journalism anyway.<p>Likewise, once you switch to digital, fixed costs melt away and so writing fees and salaries become a more salient expense.<p>One way in which journalism <i>is</i> like music and sports is that stardom matters.

OCaml also has some nice libraries, but nowhere near what .NET (or Java, for Scala) has -- so it's likely you'll have to implement your own library for some task if it's outside of the mainstream.<p>- F# has also gained some interesting features since it's branched away from OCaml -- computation expressions (syntactic sugar for monads) and type providers (automatically-generated, strongly-typed interfaces to databases, JSON APIs, etc.), for example.<p>- .NET has a mature and very fast garbage collector tuned for real world usage (e.g., people running C#/ASP.NET on large webservers). This <i>hugely</i> benefits F#'s performance.<p>- You can use Visual Studio or MonoDevelop to write and <i>debug</i> F# apps, which makes it much nicer to use in practice.

Maybe you can state it on less than a page if you use a small enough font, but the system is complex. In contrast, C semantics might be <i>large</i>, but they're not <i>complex</i>.

However this ""simplicity"" can be misleading because these general mechanisms are very powerful, and can generally be used to implement most things other languages have specialized abstractions for.  This sort of powerful and general mechanism is actually fairly hard to write an optimizing compiler for, because there's little stated explicitly about what's going to happen at runtime, and few obvious constraints about what's allowed to happen.<p>The reason LuaJIT (and most modern JIT compilers, although LuaJIT seems better than average) is so fast is because it uses very very local (in terms of both location and time) runtime context to know when to specialize operations that are conceptually much richer, e.g., ""this number is really an integer"" (Lua does not have a separate integer type), or ""I know what function/operator will be called here (even though it conceptually dispatches through a table or metatable), so I can inline it or use a direct call.""<p>I'm less sure about python (never used it much), but almost all the differences seem be user-facing ones -- large amounts of syntax-sugar for things that Lua offers sufficient <i>mechanism</i> for, but no built-in UI (in the programming-language sense).  As it's the power/complexity of the mechanism that matters, not the UI, such user-facing richness doesn't really affect a JIT compilers.",1362528901

For these, you don't need tests--no questions there. This doesn't mean you <i>never</i> need tests, but it does mean a type system can replace several kinds of tests completely.<p>If you can actually prove something with the type system, this is strictly better than using tests and tests are unnecessary there.<p>It also doesn't mean the type system will magically stop <i>all</i> bugs. Rather, it means the type system will stop all possible bugs of a particular sort. Which is very valuable.<p>The second half of the article has nothing to do with types. It is an example of where tests are insufficient. A reasonable and practical example, at that. It's completely contradictory to what you claim the article says: the whole section is about something neither types nor tests can catch!<p>It's all best summed up with the final line:<p>> <i>TDD can be useful. Types can be useful. Analysis is necessary.</i><p>I'm not sure how you can read this as ""tests + types produce bug free code"" because it clearly says that they're insufficient.",1362528580

These are <i>very</i> useful OCaml features, IMHO.<p>- OCaml has gained some very interesting features since F# branched off, which again are not present in F#: modules as first class values, GADTs, and better control over module signatures.<p>Overall, my recommendation is that unless you are really tied to .NET ecosystem, then OCaml is a more interesting language to learn.",1362528478

I know this is not the PSTN, but bear with me for a second.<p>For years, this is how Verizon/AT&T/SBC/BellSouth/etc had structured telephone networks. And this is probably the same structure they want to extend to shared data networks aka the Internet.<p>If you were a competitive telco carrier who wanted to deliver a massive amount of phone calls to Verizon customers in a particular region, you couldn&#x27;t just dump it off at the tandem (which you can think of like a telecom peering point), you had to extend your network to the end offices where the Verizon customers were aggregated.<p>The thought there being there&#x27;s finite capacity between the end office and the tandem. And if you&#x27;re going to use most of it, you should either pay for it or build your own facilities to alleviate congestion.<p>You&#x27;re dealing with a traditional telecom company (Verizon) in its telecom mindset (build to me/mid-span meet, and keep a very tight watch on ratios/meet points via accounting, billing, and state regulation), vs. a traditional Internet company (Level 3) in its traditional peering mindset (build to the exchange, then build to me, and keep a loose observation on ratios/meet points with no regulation).<p>I hope I haven&#x27;t gone too far off track.",1405668950

Every time we see a tiny bit of complexity some innovative developer says, &quot;I know, I can make a tool / library for that!&quot;. The new tool / library solves one piece of complexity but it adds to the overall burden of complexity that we all have to cope with. It&#x27;s like the whole industry has ADHD, we just can&#x27;t sit still for longer than 5 minutes.<p>I think the general rule is that complexity will inflate to about the point where a person with moderately high IQ can&#x27;t understand it any more. So if you start with a beautiful simple language (say, Python or Java) people will immediately use their free mental &quot;bandwidth&quot; to start adding layers on top of that complexity, and they won&#x27;t stop until they basically can&#x27;t understand it themselves any more. Then we will go through another cycle of simplification where someone invents a new language or approach and everyone flocks to it because it is simple and they can understand it and start assembling complexity on top of that ...

In reality, on-exchange liquidity provision is basically the kind of perfect competition that only exists in economics textbooks. Market makers are selling a commodity product (you don&#x27;t care or control who you trade stocks with) in a market where buyers are purely sensitive to price (tightest market always wins and is enforced by exchange matching rules).<p>So what actually ends up happening in a market with multiple competitive market makers? To make money, a market maker needs to trade a lot of volume. The only way to trade a lot of volume is to put up the most aggressive (worse for the market maker, better for end users) prices at any time. Market makers can only do this by charging a smaller spread than their competitors. They can only charge a smaller spread by either reducing their margins or getting smarter at deciding when to be in or out of the market, usually a combination of both. The end result is extremely tight markets that react to information very quickly (i.e. cheap to trade and very efficient).<p>Competition keeps markets honest. If you had one very fast guy, he would clean up, but when you have a dozen guys who are roughly equally fast, they all compete one another down to barely making profit above their cost of doing business. Only the most efficient can survive. If anything, we want more HFT by removing barriers to entry rather than creating a lot of regulations that would ironically help incumbents by killing off weaker competitors.",1405667729

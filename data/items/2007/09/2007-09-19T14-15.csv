Why do I need it?<p>Listing ""It extracts phone numbers"" as a feature seemed to be scraping the barrel a bit to me. Gmail extracts loads of things. Heck it even recognizes parcel tracking numbers and provides a link to track them afaik.<p>Am I right in thinking it plugs into outlook express? eugh eugh and eugh.",1190213949

56863,comment,56626,56800,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I've had the same curiosity. The GWT compiler essentially parses the Java source code and uses a series of complex rules to convert it to JS. This is why whenever you use any client side libraries you must have the source code itself rather than just the binaries. If the source code cannot be parsed directly, it cannot be converted to JS.<p>In order for GWT to work for other languages it would need to be totally rewritten, unfortunately. That is unless you could somehow write an adapter for the core GWT JRE emulation library (java.lang & java.util classes). But like you say if the language your adapting to the Java code is not statically typed, you will have a hell of a time b/c the compiler is based on the assumption that the language is still java and therefore static. Like you say, you might end up having to force the programmer to follow certain conventions. Like always naming certain datatypes a unique way, so your adapter could map it back to specific static Java datatypes. But then doing this kind of defeats the purpose of using a dynamically typed language anyway..",1190212019

Plus, as I mentioned above, it's an extremely fun read. Very well written and the ideas presented are definitely compelling. I'd recommend to go as far as to read the original research papers that the book is based on. Especially the abortion-crime one.",1190211376

2968285,comment,2967010,2967395,3,0,mattgratt,,,"OK Now I'm at home and can write you a substantive answer.  It starts here:<p>- Marketing is Highly Situational<p>- Different Markets Should Be Approached Differently<p>- Tactics are constantly changing and evolving, so mix, match, and measure until you find something that works.<p>It sounds like you're looking for the essence of web marketing strategies for early stage startups.  The best person blogging about this topic right now is a guy named Sean Ellis (<a href=""http://www.startup-marketing.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startup-marketing.com</a>) who's the CEO of Catchfree and ran marketing at some really amazing companies (Dropbox, Eventbrite, Xobni, etc.).<p>His framework, as detailed in these interviews here - <a href=""http://venturehacks.com/articles/sean-ellis-interview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturehacks.com/articles/sean-ellis-interview</a> - the Sean Ellis framework seems to be the following:<p>- Value Proposition Clarification based on user interviews/analytics/qualitative customer data.<p>- Conversion Optimization - not only conventional LPO or form optimization, but actually optimizing for high quality users, attracted by the value proposition found in part 1.<p>- Channel experimentation/optimization - At some level, web companies are not highly scalable until they can ""buy"" customers profitably - until there's a known, strong relationship between CPA (cost per acquisition) and CLTV (customer lifetime value), and of course, you can get CPA below CLTV at scale.  So this step is where experimenting with different channels and different tactics fits in.\nHere's where you'd try different channels like paid and nonpaid social media and search engine activities, other advertising channels, affiliates, etc.<p>So that's what I'd do - clarify the value, optimize the conversion flow, and then relentlessly test channels until I could find something where I could acquire customers at a profit.<p>(In an slightly related side note, I'd suggest you read Noah Kagan's blog OKdork.com, where he writes on cool startup marketing topics.)<p>(Note: this assumes your product is not a social network.)",1315367827

2968267,comment,2967578,2967705,39,0,michaelochurch,,,"It's not about meetings, incompetence, or lax work hours. It's the reality of software maintenance.<p>Lines of code is an awful metric of productivity but, yes, that figure of 3250 is accurate. Between 1,000 and 10,000 LoC per year is normal for a software engineer in the industry, and the rate is often closer to the lower number.<p>Note also that code of average architectural quality will require about 1 maintenance day per year per 80 LoC just by virtue (vice?) of existing. (Paul Graham: a full-time maintenance engineer can own 20,000 lines of code.) LoC are a cost: if we rate a developer's time (including benefits, office space, etc.) at $80/hour and charge each LoC for 4 years, we pay $32 per line of code in maintenance. (We spend $2-3 per line to <i>write</i> it.) That is, IMO, a pretty accurate estimate of what we pay for software.<p>If you write at 500 LoC/day under ideal circumstances but you're writing code that's merely average in architectural integrity, the maintenance problem will catch up with you very quickly.<p>It's a lot better to write 150 lines per day of great code (200-300 including unit tests and debugging utilities) and maintain that pace than to start out at 500+ but stall out late in the project. Great programmers don't write code at college-project speeds; they write in such a way that they can sustain triple-digits in perpetuity.<p>A single developer solves this problem by refactoring the code when necessary and incrementally improving the architecture so as to reduce the maintenance cost. It's only by doing this that projects beyond about 15,000 lines of code per person (75% maintenance burden if code is of average quality) are even feasible.<p>It's not just a problem of incompetent developers. Maintenance imposes a 70 to 90% overhead on most important projects in large companies, just because these projects become difficult or impossible to refactor and fix and their ""broken windows"" patterns of decline take on a life of their own. Individual developers can refactor aggressively when their maintenance burden breaks 50% (70% being a crisis) but this is not usually feasible for multi-developer enterprise projects that have changed hands several times.<p>The more progressive large companies now actively discourage any mention of LoC in performance reviews. First, <i>deleting</i> unnecessary code is one of the best things a person can do for a code base. Second, if someone in a big company generates 250 LoC/day reliably over years, it doesn't <i>always</i> mean that person is a great programmer; it could mean that, or it could mean that he's always taking the fun, ""green field"" projects and passing the legacy maintenance (on which 10 LoC/day is a typical clip) to others.",1315367363

You might have a prototype, but you really haven't been able to prove product/market fit yet for lack of funds? In that case it seems that some ""seed rounds"" (eg. Lanyrd and OnSwipe) are really large.<p>I also gather than the size of the investment is not what determines the ""stage"" of the round - ie. Tech Crunch reported $1mil in ""seed funding"" for OnSwipe. They later went on to raise a ""Series Awesome"" of some $5mil.<p>Then there's ""angel investment"" which seems to be much less formal and probably more likely in the tens of thousands than hundreds of thousands (or $1mil+).<p>What I'm really wondering is: at what stage are these companies with their products when they get these seemingly enormous seed rounds?<p>A lot of what I read about ""getting investment"" seems to suggest you need traction, paying customers, product/market fit, a track record of running successful companies, etc.<p>But then it seems to me (from the outside, at least) that some companies manage to get quite a substantial investment as a ""seed round"" which seems to be (again, from the outside I really have no idea what's going on under the hood here) largely to finish off an otherwise prototypical product so that it can be released to the target market.<p>It's my understanding that once you get to ""Series A"" you're basically not a ""startup"" any more (by the definition that a ""startup"" exists to find a business model).<p>As you may be able to tell, I'm thoroughly confused.

Some of the issues come down to the ad averse culture (as you pointed out), not just of the community at large but even of the staff on the back-end.<p>There are great little ideas that are not being managed effectively in my opinion.  For instance, it costs more to target a particular subreddit than the whole website, which is not particularly good for the kinds of small businesses that could really benefit from the service (there's also a daily minimum -- $20/day for site-wide, and $30/day for subreddit buys -- compared to Google, and Facebook's $1/day minimum).<p>Secondly, the true genius of the Reddit ad system is that your ad looks a lot like a regular submission.  Think about the power of Adwords -- your ad looks just like the content your potential buyers came to consume anyway.<p>Thirdly, and here is the double-edged sword -- in the comments, a conversation (actually, a long-term, multiparty conversation) can build around your company.  The power of this is truly great; however the implementation has been spotty.  Every post on Reddit is submitted via a community with rules, and moderators.  The one exception to this is self serve ads.  What you end up with is a lot of spam and trolling in your self-serve ad, which defeats the whole purpose of having the comments in the first place.<p>Unfortunately, in my experience, the admins aren't sure what to say and fallback on free speech adherence, etc. although many posts and comments are taken down in various subreddits due to a lack of observance on the part of the commentor or OP to that sub's rules.<p>TL;DR:  Reddit's self-serve ad system is a billion dollar idea in the making, but only if the culture of the community and more importantly the admins allow it to be so.",1315364505

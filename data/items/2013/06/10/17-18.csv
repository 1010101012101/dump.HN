There are just so many things competing for a kid&#x27;s attention that it makes the most sense to (most of) them  to quickly memorize a formula, get the best grade possible with minimal effort, and move on to more enjoyable things.<p>The best method I&#x27;ve found for tutoring teenage girls (and I&#x27;m saying this as a girl who hated math as a teenager in spite of a love of computers and economics) is to start off by finding out what they enjoy. Put the lessons aside, don&#x27;t try to talk theory, and don&#x27;t get all crazed trying to show her how awesome math is. Eyes will glaze over and you will have lost before you ever get started. You can&#x27;t teach someone unless you first inspire an interest.<p>What does she want to do as a career? What are her hobbies? What kinds of things interest her? At that age, she&#x27;s probably thought about a lot of different careers, and in pretty much any career, you can tie things back to math (especially junior high and early high school math).<p>If she enjoys cooking, you can talk about proportions and cross multiplication and show how you can use that to adjust the number of portions produced by a recipe. I know of one family where the parents had their daughter go on Pinterest and find recipes for a family meal, then scale them up to fit the size of their family.<p>If decor is her thing, you can talk about floor plans and usable area. Make a diagram and figure out how much space an 8&#x27; circular rug will leave for a bed and desk...the swing radius of a door is generally 1/4 of a circle, and you can&#x27;t put most things in that space.<p>Mathalicious.com is a good source of more real world lessons.<p>Take the time to walk through the logic and show how things relate back to her lessons. It&#x27;s not efficient, but in most cases, you don&#x27;t have to do this for every single concept. The goal is to (a) create interest, and (b) show how math is relevant to her life.<p>Above all, be patient and understand that even with the best, most passionate instruction...she might still hate math. The world needs many different types of people, and not all of them have to have a deep understanding of math. She can still be happy and successful even if she never learns to like math.",1370886375

When DEC wasn&#x27;t interested, he and some of his team decamped to Microsoft, where they were given the project of reviving the moribund OS/2 3 project after the IBM-Microsoft split. While OS/2 2 was the Intel 386 version, OS/2 3 was to be portable to non-x86 processors. Both PRISM and OS/2 3 fed into the new OS Cutler built for the Intel i860 CPU, a RISC/VLIW chip Intel had hoped might be a successor to the x86 line.</i><p><i>There were two versions of the chip – the basic i860XR, codenamed the N10, and the enhanced i86XP, codenamed N11. Microsoft built its own i860 workstations for the development effort, based around the i860XTR and consequently nick-named the &quot;N-Ten&quot;. The initials of these – NT – is where the eventual name for Cutler&#x27;s finished OS: Windows NT.</i>",1370886293

Self defense against common criminals\n2. Safeguard against tyranni<p>I would like to add a third reason:<p>3. Because I am a free man. Because I am sovereign. Because I hold inalienable rights. Because I harm no one by keeping arms.<p>I think the first and second arguments hold some weight[1] but really to me this is a freedom issue. I really don&#x27;t think I NEED to provide a reason why I should be allowed to own a gun, same as I don&#x27;t need to provide a reason why I am allowed to exist. It&#x27;s very simple: no one - be it my neighbor or more abstract entities - has the right to infringe on my right to life and liberty. Part of that right to exist is the right to keep instruments of self-defense.<p>Now, there are a tons of gray zones (eg I don&#x27;t think individuals have the right to build nuclear weapons in their back yard) but for guns it&#x27;s very simple. No need to throw out the baby with the bathwater here.<p>Can we really trust individuals to own guns? I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the opposite: the government is WAY less mature and responsible than individuals. The occasional misbehaving individual is a fart in the wind compared to the systematic, egregious misconduct of pretty much every government ever.

If I assigned the code to window.onload rather than onresize, it would be called (by the browser).<p>With the first phase of the onresize stage, the question was &quot;does the browser call this without user interaction?&quot;. And hey, if the question had the page in an iframe, the function would be called in IE.<p>Since a browser is so close to actually calling the function unexpectedly, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable.<p>> Technically, this could still very well happen without user interaction: consider gravity pulling out a display cable and causing the window to be relocated/resized by the OS<p>I think it&#x27;s reasonable and clear that the questions deal with the code presented and there&#x27;s no outside influence unless stated. The point about no user interaction is emphasis, it&#x27;s implicit throughout the quiz.

Instead, the military were basically posing as an &quot;armed force&quot;, because having guns <i>with</i> ammunition at airport would then actually create a security issue at the airports.<p>The security theater of the US feels somewhat like a doctor who has started to only give out placebos to his patients.

These are currently the methods that intelligence agencies use to turn assets and use them for their own ends on a small scale, but should we allow them the tools to use these techniques against an entire population simultaneously and retrospectively? What would the long-term outcome of that sort of power be?<p>I also do wonder why the <i>methods</i> they use should be secret in the first place?

No JS interpreter runs a function you define until you call it. So code is parsed and then later on, independent of its parsing, can do things.<p>When you&#x27;re asking if code does something, especially in the context of an event listener, it&#x27;s expected you&#x27;re actually running the code, regardless of how you&#x27;ve presented it. The HTML equivalent would have been to have asked if opening index.html here would&#x27;ve caused an alert to be shown.<p><pre><code>    <!-- index.html -->\n    <a href=&quot;image.html&quot;>Click me to see a funny picture.</a>\n\n    <!-- image.html -->\n    <img src=&quot;catpic1029381859834.png&quot;>\n    <script>\n        alert(&#x27;I hope you like my cat!&#x27;);\n    </script>\n</code></pre>\nA quiz should be testing actual understanding/knowledge, not intermixing over-literal interpretations and breaking reader expectations. And the wording on the question is still wrong, because as I pointed out, the sans-user-action point is emphasizing the page reload event, not the code itself, so the only logical interpretation is that the resize event happens. Technically, this could still very well happen without user interaction: consider gravity pulling out a display cable and causing the window to be relocated/resized by the OS.<p>> It&#x27;s a difficult quiz, no one&#x27;s expected to get everything right.<p>Incorrect. It&#x27;s a deceitful quiz. The delivery is excellent sans a few load-time render issues, but the content needs work.",1370884184

If you&#x27;re really concerned for her and she doesn&#x27;t want to do something, then you&#x27;re probably best off just teaching her the tricks and cheats so that she can get a good result and then forgetting about the whole thing - it&#x27;s not like maths is likely to be a particularly important aspect of her life.<p>#<p>With respect to pi in specific -<p>>  Instead of giving her the c=πd formula she wanted so badly, I wanted her to understand that π represented the amount of times the diameter &quot;fits&quot; into the circumference and that this is the relation between the parts of the circle.<p>If she&#x27;s never constructed formula to solve problems for herself, she many not know that you can do anything with that sort of information.

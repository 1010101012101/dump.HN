The core feature(s) of Twitter is pretty darn simple to build out -- scaling it up is harder, sure, but that's a Maserati problem and the kind you may never have the privilege of having anyway. But it was a neat idea, they executed it, nailed it well, and lots of other people loved it. The lesson here with them is you don't have to build something that's very big or hard or complicated, you just have to build something people want and ideally love and tell their friends about it so you don't have to advertise -- if people learn by word-of-mouth your cost-of-customer acquisition approaches zero.",1283579947

1662135,comment,1660645,1661304,0,0,carussell,,,"Here's an entry in my journal from last summer when I first heard of Grooveshark:<p><i>I stumbled across a service called Grooveshark. To be brief, Grooveshark allows the community to upload their own audio content, a la YouTube. As with YouTube, however, there exists a proliferation of copyrighted material uploaded by those who do not own the copyrights. Audio, especially music, seems to attract far more of this behavior. As a result, Grooveshark has as page for funneling those who wish to issue DMCA takedowns.[1] The content on that page is interesting―and laughable.</i><p><i>It's a shame that any networks which try to have an open system like this are afflicted by users who will ruin things. Really, it sucks. But Grooveshark's complacency―they are well aware of how their service is used―and hubris―note the attempted scare tactic of citing Online Policy Group v. Diebold―really makes me wish someone would come along and strike them down. Indeed, it looks like EMI is suing them for copyright infringement.[2] I have no sympathy for Grooveshark. At one time, it may have been a service started in earnest for distributing independent music, although I'm not even sure of this. … So now Grooveshark is part of the unfortunate force that makes the aforementioned ideas impractical, by contributing to the notion that authors' rights don't matter and further fostering that idea in the general populace as well.</i><p><i>[1] Grooveshark. Grooveshark and the DMCA. <a href=""http://www.grooveshark.com/dmca"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grooveshark.com/dmca</a>. Accessed 2009 July 26.  Archive at <a href=""http://www.webcitation.org/5iYrbE3YQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webcitation.org/5iYrbE3YQ</a> </i><p><i>[2] Rosoff, Matt.

CNET News. 2009 June 18.  Accessed 2009 July 26. Archive at <a href=""http://www.webcitation.org/5iYs4ZiIP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webcitation.org/5iYs4ZiIP</a> </i><p>When I originally wrote that, I used the word ""complacency"" there, and the rest of what I wrote was along that idea. As I recall, however, their complacency wasn't the real motivator behind my anger; the DMCA practically requires it. Really, what made me most mad was the sense of <i>complicity</i> they had exhibited. They were essentially encouraging the infringing use without explicitly saying so, but in a kind of nudge-nudge-wink-wink manner as if to skirt legal liability.<p>EDIT: There are three things that I recall that really pissed me off, now that I think about it.<p>1. If you so much as checked out the popular music list, it resembled a p2p listing, filled with <i>clearly</i> infringing content. Removing that content wouldn't seem to result in them falling afoul of the DMCA safe harbor provisions, since it's not like they're actively making an attempt to seek out infringing use and take care of it in the absence of a takedown. This was the type of pervasiveness that would basically make it impossible for any Grooveshark employees to use the service without being made aware of massive, visible infringement. I would assert that you would have had a hard time finding music that <i>wasn't</i> infringing at the time.<p>2. The previously-mentioned nudge-nudge-wink-winkedness of their attitude. What's more, it was like they were trying to pull a fast one by mentioning OPG v. Diebold. (Aggressive IP lawyers for corporations generally don't seem to care if you present sound justification for cases like legitimate fair use, so what makes you think they're going to turn the other way based on a bluff founded on bullshit?) Additionally, item 2 on their DMCA page said and still says:<p><i>Please provide us with at minimum a URL to each work that is claimed to be infringing.  Note: Providing us with search terms such as ""Artist A"" or ""Song B"" will not be considered reasonably sufficient for us to locate the alleged infringing work. There may be 100 versions of ""Song B"", and you may only have the rights to request a takedown for one of those versions.</i><p>It didn't help that if you pulled up a list with 100 versions of a song, 100 of them would have been infringing uses at the time that I wrote that piece, nor did it help that the Grooveshark website was an inaccessible Flash-based piece of crap that make that kind of data collection cumbersome. It's still a Flash-based site, but a different one, and I'm not sure how much has changed since I wrote that.<p>It's almost as if they thought to themselves ""Hey, if we put this wording in the DMCA page to scare them off and make it really hard for the fearless, we can ensure we'll remain untouched and last forever!"" Like I said, hubris.<p>3. The big deal behind Grooveshark was that they wanted to do cooperative marketing/revenue with the labels based on ads. This came under the guise of independent artists being allowed to upload music and then the profits would be split. What it really meant was that you'd see a tracklisting of the form similar to ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl — brianw639""; everyone was making money off of this <i>except</i> the artists and labels.",1283579652
1662134,comment,1660096,1661028,0,0,munchhausen,,,"> Same reason why tcsh and ksh didn't get traction, and they even have merit to them.<p>In the world of enterprise Unix, ksh is king. It is used even for ""serious"" applications, not only as the sysadmin's glue of choice (the company where I work at was using, in 2009, a HR payroll application written in ksh. Had they not outsourced accounting to a third party, they would probably still be using it today).<p>Granted, ""legacy"" Unices are being slowly obsoleted by Linux, but ksh lives on.

But once you are in the organization size range where you're adding a 500th person, a 10,000th person, then the organization almost always takes on other qualities and conditions: bureaucracy, slowing down, middle management, rules, paperwork, gossip, insulation from consumers/competition, groupthink, aversion to risk, and so on. And these qualities dumb it down. The ""group brain"" becomes much dumber than a smart brain when left alone and unfettered as an individual.<p>Google is a bit of an exceptional case where despite having on the OOM of 20k employees they don't seem to have quite succumbed to Big Dumb Company-itis.

That's how iTunes already works, and iTunes is already consistent.<p>What's consistent about arbitrarily removing 'pause' functionality when not necessary? That is not consistent, and it's poor usability.<p>> However, those things are contrary to your suggestion:<p>No. Browsing around non-playlist-determining sections of iTunes does not imply I want to change or stop a playlist/track. So why remove the pause function, if the only reason to do that is so you can start a new playlist?<p>>It's very easy: The playback controls ""always"" apply to the playlist you are viewing.<p>Which is of no use to anyone if they aren't viewing a play list at all. Really, this was established in my very first comment. It's the <i>iTunes store</i>. There is no playlist to play other than the one I selected to play in the first place. Why exactly prevent me from pausing, when there's just no reason that would be helpful. You still haven't answered this.<p>> It's very easy.<p>Multiple clicks/mouse positionings are never easier than just one. Never.<p>> Look, it's clear you haven't really thought things through. You just need to learn how iTunes works.<p>That's sort of pointless to claim. You haven't proven anything, so such grand pronouncements as to someones general comprehension of the issue are useless to everyone. I suggest you prove your point with a specific argument, instead of making unsupported assertions, basically that amounts to ""You're just wrong."" That's never really a help to a discussion.<p>>(You also need to learn how to reply to the correct comment)<p>And no, I already know which comment to reply to, but the link simply wasn't there.

And as you said, you don't wear them in social situations, which is exactly what will be required with 3D tv.

I used to routinely use old 486 and first-gen Pentiums as cheap gateway boxes but now I will just flash a new bit of firmware into a wireless base station and toss the old hardware.",1283576814

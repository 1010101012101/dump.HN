58394,comment,58306,58306,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"I like how the article claims that the humanities have a better view of the meaning of life...<p>""And in the process it has badly weakened the humanities, the disciplines with the oldest and deepest connection to this question""<p>Why does 'oldest' == 'best'?  And how can he claim 'deepest'?  Cosmology or math could certainly be reasonable contenders for this claim.<p>This article is flawed - college shouldn't exist to answer the 'meaning of life question' - it teaches people to be better learners, and to follow their interests.<p>But perhaps I missed something - I kind of stopped reading at that point.",1190494478

58392,comment,58244,58257,0,0,tel,,,"Haskell is fun in that you get to write things using combinators, through abusing laziness, and in a style that feels very mathematical. It makes me program utility function combinators in other languages, which is excellent.<p>It's not so fun the moment you want to use more than one Monad at once, though.",1190494076

58385,comment,58327,58356,0,0,bluishgreen,,,"""I was a 19-year old trying to convince myself and others that I was a man. So, with the other performers, I became at least as profane - nay, foul mouthed and filthy minded, as the most immature of them. I worked hard to develop some fluidity and cleverness in my vulgarity and won my share of laughs from the others.Yet during this whole time I lived with my parents coming down the mountain at an insane speed late at night only to end up in a home where certain words were simply never said and I never said them. Not once did I slip and speak in front of my family the way I spoke constantly in front of the other performers of Sundance. This was not by any herculean effort either, I did not think about changing my behavior. When I was with my parents I wasn't the same person. I have seen this time and again with my friends, with other family members, our whole demeanor changes, our manners, our figures of speech, when we move from one context to another. Listen to someone you know when they pickup the telephone. You have special voices for different people. Our attitudes, our moods change depending on whom we are with.""<p>-Orson Scott Card, Speaker For The Dead. (Introduction, pg 18)

58380,comment,58025,58025,0,0,whoami,,,"It is true that many works on philosophy are complicated because they fail to accurately define the meaning of the terms they are discussing. However, the solution proposed by this essay would result in the reduction of philosophy to self-improvement books like the 7 Habits of this and that.<p>In his book, Wittgenstein said that one must be silent on those things about which one cannot speak. The idea as advanced in his lecture on ethics is that some things simply cannot be expressed in human language and one should not try to speak about them. But is there really any harm in trying?<p>Anything useful that came out of philosophy is called something else: mathematics, science, etc. It has not failed. We should keep on trying.<p>",1190491669
58379,comment,58025,58025,0,0,gabrielroth,,,"I'm surprised that your essay doesn't deal directly with the branch of philosophy known as ethics, as practiced by such canonical philosophers as Kant, Hume, Bentham and Mill, and by contemporary philosophers like Peter Singer, Michael Walzer, Jonathan Glover, and John Rawls. Their work addresses some of the most general questions (what is a just action or a just society?), and it seems to meet your utility criterion: if you find it convincing, you have to do things differently. <p>Is this not an example, from within the mainstream of philosophy, of the thing you're calling for?",1190491608
58378,comment,58025,58025,0,0,pmetzger,,,"In addition to Sokal's hack on ""Social Text"", I believe that Rob Pike did a test in which random texts produced by running a Markov chain over Derrida were found to be indistinguishable by informed readers from actual Derrida. (I'm probably misremembering at least some details of the actual incident but the gist is, I'm pretty sure, true.)

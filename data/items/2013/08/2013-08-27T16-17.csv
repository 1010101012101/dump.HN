6284639,comment,6284001,6284001,4,0,jrochkind1,,,"While designed to make things easier for newcomers -- I think these features are actually some of the biggest culprits in making things _harder_ for newcomers, because they fail at so many edges, and when they do fail, there&#x27;s so much magic going on that it&#x27;s nearly impossible for a newcomer (or even an intermediate user!) to figure out what&#x27;s going on and why.<p>I think the heavy emphasis on auto-loading was a mistake, that someone writing a new framework would be wise to learn from and not repeat.<p>The reloading in dev mode is HUGELY convenient, I have to admit so I have trouble calling it a mistake -- but is also a huge mess when it fails, and does not work under multi-threaded request dispatch.  That latter will, I think, become an increasing problem as more people use multi-threaded request dispatch in Rails -- Rails4 has multi-threaded request dispatch on by defualt in production mode. But I think <i>not</i> in development mode, precisely because of the code-reloading problem. But I&#x27;m not sure diverging the dev and production environments (violating 12-factor, incidentally) is a good sustainable solution.",1377622785

So I wrote my own program called turtrades (test your trades). It basically presentments you with random stock in random past date and lets you trade or pass. Doing this I am using real historical market data and train my brain to spot winning patters and I get instant result.

6284618,comment,6284329,6284535,8,0,bhauer,,,"The analogy is a little flimsy, but I&#x27;ll run with it anyway: I consider Go today to be similar in some ways to Java at around the time of Java 1.1 or 1.2.<p>Obviously, Go is <i>modern</i> and is in many ways better than today&#x27;s Java 1.7.  But I am trying to illustrate its maturity level and the trajectory that I believe it&#x27;s on.  If you recall the days of Java 1.1, it was already seeing a great deal of early traction.  The early traction of Go seems roughly the same to me.  Also Java in its 1.1/1.2 years was on a clear trajectory to become a dominant language.  I think Go will only grow in popularity for years to come in the same fashion.  Even as a primarily Java developer, I look forward to Go being a clear and viable alternative.<p>I could be wrong about the trajectory, of course.<p>But I believe a short answer to your question is: if you&#x27;re considering it, take some time to actually do something with Go.  At first something experimental, then something for production use.<p>As a long-time JVM user, I&#x27;ve been trying to explain to other developers for a while now that assuming you use a modern approach to Java development, the <i>performance</i> of the JVM allows you to be (in my opinion) even more efficient than a dynamic language because you can code your application fairly recklessly.  You can defer optimization in all of its forms for a long time, perhaps infinitely.  The resulting mindset is a dramatically reduced concern about performance.  When I work with most dynamic languages, I can never fully set aside the inner voice saying, &quot;this is going to perform like crap.&quot;  Trouble is, the voice is often right.<p>Go brings the same ballpark of performance as the JVM and a style that I believe is more appealing to Python developers than a modern Java stack (although I don&#x27;t think modern Java stacks are given much of a fair shake because of Java&#x27;s legacy, but that&#x27;s a separate rant entirely).",1377622616

You still need to transport for the raw materials, and most people will not have industrial-scale 3D printers in their homes (any more than they have industrial-scale paper printers in their homes).  There are also limits to what can be 3D printed, and those limits will remain in effect for the foreseeable future -- liquids, timber, food, and so forth are not things that will be easy to print, but they remain important and they are often transported by rail.<p>If anything American railroads should be rejoicing about 3D printing, as it will encourage more domestic manufacturing and create new opportunities in transporting both raw materials and finished products.<p>(Edit: I know it sounds like I am making the same argument people made in the 1960s about computers in the home.

6284596,comment,6283309,6284293,3,0,pflats,,,"The best place to look at what is being taught as &quot;Algebra&quot; at the high school level is to go to the (new) source: the Common Core State Standards Initiative[1]. 45 states (and DC) are using the standards. The best places to start are Math Appendix A[2], which explains the Initiative&#x27;s recommendations for a High School curriculum, and the Introduction to the Algebra Strand[3], which describes (in brief) the goals for actual algebra instruction.<p>>If High Schools truly wanted to introduce Algebra to students in a &quot;pure&quot; form then Math teachers would need to know/understand Abstract Algebra. And then be able to teach introductory ideas to Abstract Algebra which, in all honesty, anyone can come to understand.<p>They don&#x27;t. Not on the general level. You&#x27;re worrying overmuch about semantics. The name &quot;Algebra&quot; isn&#x27;t ever going away; no high school guidance department wants to explain to every single college that their program teaches the same thing as a normal &quot;Algebra 1&quot; class but just calling it &quot;Practical Mathematics&quot;. (Incidentally, &quot;Practical Mathematics&quot; would imply much more basic mathematics, your traditional &quot;Home Economics&quot; class with taxes, investments, credit cards, balancing checkbooks, etc.)<p>Beyond that, abstraction is much, much, much, harder for the average student than you realize. Students have trouble seeing the relationship between the Distance Formula and the Pythagorean Theorem. Some have trouble even manipulating basic formulas, such as solving the Ideal Gas Law for a given variable. They will insist on plugging in the numbers into PV=nRT every time, and then solving the equation over and over again. Dividing by 5 is tangible and easily visualized to these students, dividing by R is not.<p>Math teachers take the job because we love math and want to share that with our students, but practical concerns come first. Symbolic manipulation is much more widely used in the average high school student&#x27;s future education than pure math. I, and many teachers, include facets of pure mathematics in our courses. When my Honors Geometry students begin working with infinity, I have them read Strogatz&#x27;s excellent piece on Hilbert[4], which is one of the most popular assignments each year. (And yes, there is next to no Geometry in there, but you have to keep minds sharp somehow.) I also throw in some basic Real Analysis when discussing the concept of rigor in proofs.  When my Algebra 2 classes have to trudge through a brief review of Algebra 1, we spend the time talking about why closure matters, and what number systems are and are not closed over what operations. My PreCalc classes do a decent amount of Number Theory.<p>Finally, most schools offer Discrete Mathematics (i.e., an introduction to Pure Math) as a senior-level math elective. However, it&#x27;s competing for the brightest minds with AP Calculus and AP Statistics. If you&#x27;d like to see more students study Pure Mathematics, the best way to do that would probably be to gather a group of like-minded educators and petition the College Board to create an AP course covering said material<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.corestandards.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.corestandards.org</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.corestandards.org/assets/CCSSI_Mathematics_Appendix_A.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.corestandards.org/assets/CCSSI_Mathematics_Append...</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSA/introduction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSA/introduction</a><p>[4]<a href=""http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/the-hilbert-hotel/?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/the-hilbert-...</a>",1377622465

They just do it differently. They have no problem spreading their DNA throughout the world via seeds and pollen. They use a lot less energy too, compared with sprouting legs and getting up to walk around. If they did this, they would likely require much greater quantities of food, including protein, which would put plants at a disadvantage.<p>In any case, plants have also evolved on a completely different fitness track than that of animals. Plants have evolved incredible manipulation of chemistry, far beyond what humans can produce today, let alone even understand.<p>I recently finished reading Botany of Desire (Michael Pollan) where he describes how plants have co-evolved with humans, appealing to our selection of flowers, fruits, and vegetables to further distribute their DNA.

I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s because go is changing so much as the kinds of problems people are encountering writing web services that need to scale (or at least have that option).<p>I&#x27;ve been comparing go to scala lately and what has really got me into go is the development speed. The fast compiles and fast web page auto-reload make it feel every bit as fast to develop in as ruby or python or php, but with type safety, fewer tests, and very clean code.<p>Scala is a fantastic language, but even with jrebel autoreload you still have 2-3 second page reloads and a 5 second test suite reload. That seems like a small thing, but the faster I see code change results, the more hooked I am to the process. A 5 second wait is probably enough to get me out of the zone.<p>With go, on just a default simple test of a small thing it is less than a second to compile/run. In revel, pages reload/update as fast/faster than they do in rails/sinatra.<p>Oh, and with go, each web request will run in a separate goroutine, so you get excellent nonblocking IO performance without dealing with the callback soup of node.js.<p>It might just be irrational exuberance because I haven&#x27;t built anything big and messy yet, but so far go is seriously fantastic and solves a lot of real world problems elegantly.",1377621970

Separation of concerns ftw!<p>The value, to me, is that I can create true modules with html, css, and js that are scoped to ONLY inside the <x-whatever> tag I design (finally my css won&#x27;t step on other css and I won&#x27;t have to use unnecessary selectors to ensure that), and it will all be handled by the browser; no libraries needed (if web components becomes standardized of course).<p>For now, google and mozilla are creating polyfills to add this functionality because they want people to get onboard with the web component thing so that it will drive adoption and a consensus on how it should work in the final spec.

6284501,comment,6283601,6284038,2,0,yeahbutbut,,,"The problem (as I see it) is that when you learn a framework you&#x27;re learning another person&#x27;s vocabulary for talking about a category of problems.  This is very useful when you&#x27;re just starting out, but becomes problematic later on as you start to do more complex tasks that weren&#x27;t necessarily well understood by the framework author(s).<p>The issue I have with frameworks is that the Factories tend to be too tightly coupled to the problems that the original dev or dev team saw, and they aren&#x27;t flexible enough for me to re-imagine their purpose.  They are a perfectly abstracted a solution to a concrete problem, and implementing their [collection|object pool|routing] &quot;API&quot; will only let you change the steps in the process that <i>they</i> thought needed changing.<p>Factories are a fixed-arity solution to an infinite arity problem.  I can&#x27;t recompose factories like I can functions (in a language with first class functions).  Not to mention that the APIs created to marshal data between the objects created by these factories tend to be poorly thought out because, let&#x27;s face it, we&#x27;re all monkeys banging out code and none of us can think at the proper level of abstraction to consider everything.  But instead of using simple data types and &quot;assume-nothing&quot; interfaces, they try to create an abstract interface with a sample size of one problem.  That&#x27;s never going to work.<p>Enterprise Frameworks typically say factory when they mean &quot;configuration&quot;.  And when they say pluggable there should be a footnote that says *with any of our handful of implementations, don&#x27;t try to write one yourself.  They&#x27;re very good training wheels, but they aren&#x27;t the panacea to everyone&#x27;s problems.  Use them when they make things easier, ditch them when they get in the way.

And tool users had to develop the skill to use general purpose tools.  They could then tackle a variety of tasks.<p>Today it appears that the most effort goes to making special purpose toolkits (e.g., frameworks).  The only &quot;skill&quot; that the toolkit user must develop is mastering the toolkit.  But the kits are enormous, the documentation is enormous and the time commitment is, relative to the number and variety of tasks she will be equipped to tackle after mastery, enormous.  I&#x27;d venture to guess most users of frameworks only use a small fraction of the toolkit.  Hence they can only tackle a small fraction of the tasks that the toolkit could permit them to tackle were they to master all of it.  To learn how to use every feature (every tool) within these specialized kits would seemingly take a &quot;lifetime&quot;.<p>Is learning a &quot;framework&quot; worth my time?  What happens when the tasks change and the toolkit I&#x27;ve mastered is replaced by a different one?  What if I spent my time learning how to use the general purpose tools (still available on every computer running UNIX) that can be used to build special purpose toolkits instead?<p>Measured in terms of learning and skill development, maybe the greatest benefactors of frameworks are the folks that build them.  That is a thought I had.  Presumably they must themselves know how to use more general purpose tools.  Thus they can build frameworks of more specialized tools.  If this is true, that is a skill that is worth the time investment, in my opinion.<p>Joel on Software was a great forum.  I only wish Joel was a UNIX programmer.

However you raise something that makes me wish to address the muddiness of the details.<p>> Using a smaller technology stack makes for an easier learning curve, but your day job after learning the basics involves ten times as much code ( == ten times as many opportunities for bugs...<p>I think you&#x27;re implying here that not having written the framework abstractions yourself or in-house will reduce bug count. First, to be a bit pedantic, the <i>opportunities</i> for bugs is roughly the same over a given feature set between coded-with-framework and written-from-scratch. The the number of discovered and undiscovered outstanding bugs over that same feature set <i>may</i> be lower, but this doesn&#x27;t necessarily reduce risk.<p>By using a framework you&#x27;re making the assumption that most major bugs have been found and fixed by the sheer volume of people testing the framework in the wild. In a general sense, this is often a valid assumption. However this is in no way a guarantee of good testing coverage.<p>In my day job we decided to make further use of an open source tool to satisfy a particular security requirement. The tool in question has a community of nearly ten thousand users. However, it turns out that the advertised feature we wished to use was never really adopted by anyone in the community. Because of this we found a major &quot;barrier to entry&quot; type bug that had been outstanding for close to <i>four</i> years, and we lost nearly a month before deciding to scrap the effort and use something else.<p>Beyond bug count, it&#x27;s been my experience that when framework bugs do crop up they&#x27;re more likely to be very costly or time consuming. I say this for a few reasons. First, let&#x27;s make two fairly reasonable (I hope) assumptions:<p>Assumption #1: Most people use frameworks to avoid having to worry about the details for which the framework offers a solution. This usually is the main value proposition of a framework (and the quote above alludes to this). This means that when you plan and design your software, you typically assume that the framework is correct. Most people don&#x27;t budget time/expense for learning the framework&#x27;s internals.<p>Assumption #2: If the framework is battle-hardened, most of the bugs you&#x27;ll probably find are in oddball edge cases and/or are very difficult to track down.<p>In the best scenario your framework code is open and you can fix the bug yourself if need be. However you pay for this this with the original perceived value of the framework (no need to be an expert in its inner workings), and a <i>lot</i> of unbudgeted time. And let&#x27;s face it; when we&#x27;re in a time crunch, we don&#x27;t do our best work. The probability of introducing new bugs when this occurs is quite high.<p>Aside from the specific application details that you&#x27;re now worrying about, you now have new unplanned-for operational overhead. How do you maintain the change to correct the bug? You&#x27;ll either need to figure out the correct procedures/coding style/etc to submit a patch/pull-request, or you&#x27;ll need to maintain your own fork of the framework.<p>Or in the other case where you&#x27;re working with a closed-source product you&#x27;re just up a creek. Oh you paid for support? Isn&#x27;t that cute...<p>I don&#x27;t say any of this to attack frameworks. I use them myself quite often. However I <i>do</i> say this to attack the idea that frameworks make it safe for developers to remain ignorant to the inner workings of their system, regardless of which parts were designed/built in-house, as the fact  that something is made and supported by a third party, commercial or community, has no bearing on its quality alone.",1377620353

6284345,comment,6283436,6283436,3,0,chasing,,,"I&#x27;ve been a freelancer for the better part of 17 years. A few quick reactions:<p>1. (Code reviews.) This seems really rare, in my experience, and there are a few problems with it. For one, the code reviewer might not be better than the original developer. And they may not know the constraints and development process of the project. Secondly, the one time someone wrote up a major code review for a project I had recently finished, I felt they were nit-picking and falling into the trap of &quot;well, that&#x27;s not how I would&#x27;ve done it&quot; mostly just so they could land a job fixing the alleged problems.<p>Even if you&#x27;re non-technical, I might suggest asking the developer to show you how they&#x27;ve organized the code. Just because you&#x27;re curious how it works. I really enjoy teaching people about code, and it can be fun when non-technical people get a glimmer of understanding. And I think you can tell a lot about how clearly someone thinks simply by how clearly they can explain what they&#x27;re doing.<p>2. (Sample projects.) Sorry, I don&#x27;t do these. Look at my portfolio, resume, and go use some stuff I&#x27;ve built. If you think I&#x27;m lying to you about my involvement in those, then we have a bigger problem on our hands. If you need to, ask me for the contact info of someone I&#x27;ve previously worked with and talk to them about me.<p>3. (Goals not being aligned.) No two people ever have perfectly-aligned goals -- there&#x27;s no need to get weird about it. Part of hiring someone is assessing whether you can trust them to do what they&#x27;re expected to do. You&#x27;ll get better at this with age. And hiring developers you can meet and talk to face-to-face is probably important. I am a professional and I am invested in the success of my clients. Because I&#x27;m a human being with a soul. And because it makes me look better if I can say &quot;I built this app and then the company went on to wild success!&quot;<p>4. (Tests.) It&#x27;s all about budget and timeline. And project complexity.<p>5. (Communication.) Yes, good communication is key.<p>6. (Hourly vs. fixed-price.) My clients mostly want fixed-price contracts, which is fine. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t trust me -- it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s easier to predict budgets that way. If trust is really such an issue that you need to worry about whether a developer is wasting time and you&#x27;re thinking about hiring someone to audit(!) their timesheet, you have a bigger problem on your hands. So much in life requires trusting people and you need to either find people you can consistently rely on or come up with some ways of judging the trustworthiness of someone that doesn&#x27;t involve micromanaging them. As for not getting screwed on fixed-price contracts: Trust also comes into play. But so does a well thought-out contract that spells out exactly what&#x27;s expected from everyone and when. A contract doesn&#x27;t replace trust. But it does make sure that everyone&#x27;s on board with all of the nitty-gritty details and it lets everyone know what happens if something goes wrong. Think of it as a design document for your working relationship.<p>Anyway -- I&#x27;m glad people are thinking about these issues, but my general sense, here, is that Danny Britz is fairly new to this and has been hiring people off of relatively impersonal cattle-call sites like Elance. Which is fine. But I think that once you establish a rapport with some developers and get more experience working with them you&#x27;ll find that you don&#x27;t have to be quite as fearful that they&#x27;re going to screw you.",1377620188

6284270,comment,6283280,6283576,7,0,this_user,,,"Germany politics are and have been for the last couple of years in a rather curious state where the opposition appears to have given up on attacking Merkel in any meaningful way. I think there are several factors that play into this.<p>First of all, after the 2005 election a grand coaltion between Merkel&#x27;s CDU and the social democratic SPD was formed leaving only the three smaller parties with a combined 166 out of 614 seats as the opposition. This put the SPD in the position of the CDU&#x27;s junior partner instead of their usual position of attacking the CDU&#x27;s political agenda. What may be even worse from the SPD&#x27;s perspective is that the are now in the position of having supported the decisions made in Merkel&#x27;s first term which would make it less than believable to attack those decisions now.<p>In the 2009 election the CDU only lost a marginal amount of votes while the SPD suffered heavy losses to the benefit of the three smaller parties. This allowed Merkel to form the traditional coalition consisting of CDU and the liberal FDP thereby leaving 290 of 622 seats to the oppposition and allowing the SPD to resume their role as the main force in opposition.<p>Except they never did. Instead of mounting attacks on the government, they stayed tame and oftentimes even concurred with the government on decisions despite no longer being in power. I am not sure about their reasons. Their lack of charismatic leadership personnel may have played a role, but that can only explain so much.<p>The second and more important factor is probably Merkel&#x27;s very specific style of governing. She tends to be extremely passive, never exposing herself and opening herself up to criticism. If possible, she avoids making decisions at all. If she has to make decisions, she will always take the popular choice. If hard or controvesial decisions have to be made, she never makes a proposal herself. A proposal is either leaked to the press or presented by one of her ministers. In case said proposals garners widely negative reactions, the minister takes the blame giving Merkel the opportunity to shield herself from the fallout. Should an extraordinary event like the Fukushima accident lead to a sudden reversal in public opinion (towards nuclear energy in this case), Merkel will immediately flip her position and take the opposite one. If you have paid close attention to German politics in the last couple of years, you will see these exact steps repeated over and over again.<p>The worst part is, it works. Her latest approval rating is at 60% compared to 25% for the SPD candidate. Somehow she has managed to lull not only to public but also her political opposition to sleep over her two terms in office. This leaves us in 2013, a month away from the election with an opposition that behaves more like her pet kitten than her political challenger. What is even worse, is the fact that it leaves the population without a real choice for political change.",1377619354

Lamarck&#x27;s Lemma, which is a term I made up, points out that, were a random walk to create a mechanism for Lamarckian evolution, Darwinian evolution might well keep it around, as it could offer fitness.<p>That&#x27;s why I phrase it as a lemma on Darwin&#x27;s theory: even if it proves true, as epigenetics suggests, it doesn&#x27;t make Lamarckian thinking correct.

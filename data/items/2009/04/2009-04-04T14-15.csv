546342,comment,546258,546320,0,0,samt,,,"Having evaluated oss message queues for high volume web services I can see exactly how twitter might make this decision.
 - activemq: high resource usage, not super stable at high loads
 - rabbitmq: messages must ALL fit into memory. Your message queue should be a ""rescue me"" button - if all your dbs go down, just queue crap to disk. You do not want to worry about memory overflow in that situation.
 - memcacheq: super stable, low resource consumption but fixed message size (padding for smaller messages).<p>We ended up using memcacheq but it's hardly what you would call full featured, so we'll have to do prioritization, etc in our code.",1238857196

Even if those laws are still there, they are not upheld enough by far. Most muslims and teachers go against the law and let the muslim female wear their symbol of submission to muslim males domination.<p>You DO know there are countries in the world where women are KILLED because they didn't wear their Hijab or Burqa ?
This isn't a religious symbol I want allowed in France.

546338,comment,546080,546167,0,0,mustpax,,,"I sort of agree, Craigslist is written in Perl, and it has to be a perfect example of a spartan get-the-job done sort of site.<p>That said, the analogy made me smile. Perl really is one of those languages, that by learning, you only learn Perl. And maybe regular expressions, but I learned about those in theory of computation class. When I learned C I learned about the tenets of the OS: the call stack, virtual memory, system calls, interrupts, all the ugly stuff. Same with Java, it gave me good appreciation of OO, because it's so fundamentally OO. Basically, these languages were educational beyond themselves.<p>Perl, on the other hand, lets you get things done real fast in its problem domain. It also encourages some of the worst programming practices and an obsession with obscure brevity, code golf. More and more I'd just rather write everything in Python. Even though it may require 10 more lines of code,  I can think about the problem in pretty much the same way I would in Perl. Plus, I can read the script afterwards, which really really helps.<p>A deep fryer is also super-utilitarian. Can you imagine McDonalds, or any burger chain, without fries? But it really is the nutritional equivalent of Perl.",1238856800

546330,comment,546080,546314,0,0,windsurfer,,,"I don't know about you, but I can't look in more than one direction at once. I have never really needed multiple monitors, and when I've tried them, I find them a hindrance.  I find it frustrating when monitors have different resolutions and things don't line up. I also lose the ""edges"" of desktops when I have multiple monitors. For example: I can't easily click something on the top right of the screen because if I move too far right, I'm on the other monitor. And not to mention the constant managing of windows and setting things up to open on the right monitor. I much prefer virtual desktops on my 1280x800 screen.<p>Some tools might reduce the ""friction"" but reduce functionality and usability in ways that you don't think of. As another example, I frequently see people creating huge hierarchies of folders in their home folders such as ""/home/user/projects/school/year/class01/week_number/assignment_number/revision/"". They think they're being organized, when really, they're just slowing themselves down. It makes it easier to classify things, but it makes it harder to actually <i>get things done</i>.",1238856242

Somehow in this post the author fails to mention the details of the warrant, instead going off on a tirade about the loss of freedom.<p>In general, nobody is coming into your data center and seizing anything unless its part of a criminal investigation. As such, a judge has to sign the warrant and the petitioner has to explicitly describe what is being searched for.<p>I can understand the writer being upset about his datacenter, but either he is not fully aware of the situation or is being purposefully misleading.

Some group of colonists a long time ago picked some attributes that they thought were important to their circumstances (British rule) and drew a clear line in the sand (guns, speech, religion, etc).<p>The Netherlands were formed under different circumstances, and maybe for them an individual's right to say whatever the fuck he wants to - no matter how bad it is - is important, but is superseded by a desire to preserve other 'freedoms' in a highly fragmented, multicultural environment historically prone towards minority persecution.  Gun ownership is another good example: 'freedom' from the government, or 'freedom' to live in a society with a lower risk of being shot.  There's no right answer, of course.<p>Personally, I feel just as free here as I do in the US.  I can live in a similar fashion with no real restrictions that affect me or my friends, and feel that (should I disagree with the government) I can be politically active and not suffer from unfair retaliation.  I can even vote here as a foreigner (try that in the US).  Are there theoretical things I can't do here but can in the US?  Of course, but that works both ways.",1238854463

Googling for 'spore fun' reveals quotes from people along these lines:<p><i>Yeah, its a pointless game, but still fun at the same time. Sure, you have goals, but they’re just there to get your creations moving. And really, they’re boring as hell and wouldn’t last if it weren’t for the creation aspect. The only redeeming gameplay modes are the cell stage and the space stage. The other ones are short, easy, and a chore.</i><p>And another:<p><i>I played the game for maybe 10 hours. For the first 30min its pretty cool.. i mean being a cell is kinda fun... simple eating and running away. When you get to different stages like creture, tribal, civ, and space.. first few minutes is not too bad when you get to try the new stuff.. but soon after you know how the stage works, its gets repetitive and boring. The concept is pretty sweet that you get to evolve and design your own creature and buildings and vehicles.. but the game gets repetitive and boring. It gonna take a lot of time and trust me youll just get bored of it.</i><p>Spore had an insane amount of hype and PR surrounding its launch.  They even had a public demo of Robin Williams creating a character before much was known about the character creator.  And yet, Spore appears to have fizzled out, and rightly so.  Consumers might put up with DRM if the gameplay is good, but DRM + boring gameplay = 1 1/2 stars on Amazon:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Spore-Pc/dp/B000FKBCX4/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1238853922&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Spore-Pc/dp/B000FKBCX4/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1...</a><p>So the PC/Console gaming scene isn't very similar to the music scene, mostly because games have to keep people's attention for more than 4 minutes (or ~1 hour for an album).<p>However, casual gaming is an entirely different beast, and does share a lot of similarities with the music industry.  But all I'm saying is, if a game is bad, people are going to find out.",1238854021

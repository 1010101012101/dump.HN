He was saying things that could be inferred as offensive to me, sitting in front of him.<p>It must get really tiring, carrying such a heavy chip on the shoulder.  How is anybody supposed to know she&#x27;s Jewish?  If they did know and modified their behavior accordingly, they might end up being called bigoted.  Is there any way to win this one in Richards&#x27;s book?<p>&quot;Could be inferred as offensive to me&quot; -- wow.  Again, how is anybody supposed to know what <i>could</i> offend <i>you</i>?  If this is the standard for offense, it looks like the only winning move in communication is not to do any at all.<p>I&#x27;d feel worse about dredging this up so many months later, but Richards is active on Twitter lately arguing about it, so I&#x27;m not really opening old wounds.  Maybe she has a legitimate beef about the exact timeline and chain of cause and effect as reported in the article, but righting that would really not make her look significantly better IMO.  She dug her hole deeper in this new interview (at least the way it&#x27;s presented to us), regardless of small errors it may have about the post.<p>P.S.  Even if this is their fault for offending her with the joke, it doesn&#x27;t follow that it&#x27;s right for people to lose jobs over it.  The article seems to suggest she intended that (&quot;... people are like, ‘Adria didn’t know what she was doing by tweeting it.’ Yes, I did.&quot;)  Her justification for this disproportionate response is some mishmash of the offense, race, gender, and that the offender wasn&#x27;t mentally retarded (seriously.)<p>&quot;No one would have known he got fired until he complained... Maybe he’s to blame for complaining that he got fired.&quot;  I can agree that it probably would have not turned so ugly if this fact hadn&#x27;t come out.  But this is not a card Richards can play without hypocrisy, IMO.  They both experienced something negative in relative private, that provoked an emotional response that led them to post publicly about, that caused the &quot;righteous pitchfork mobs&quot; to react.  If Richards had the right to tweet about the joke, &quot;Hank&quot; had the right to post his own negative aftermath on Hacker News.  She found out the sword of righteous crusading on the internet cuts both ways, but does not admit her part in it.<p>Also, to be clear, I in no way condone the threats to Adria Richards and have mixed feelings about her losing her job.",1424573364

9087988,comment,9085411,9087972,0,0,fspeech,,,"&quot;A recent autopsy study reported on 314 African American and 211 Caucasian (sic) men aged 20–80 years who died of trauma in Detroit, USA. Microscopic evaluation in each case was based on 10–14 whole-mount step sections that were 2–3 mm thick.4 This study demonstrated a high prevalence of prostate cancer that increased progressively with advancing age and was similar at all ages in African American compared with Caucasian men (around 10%, 30%, 40%, 45%, 70% and 80% in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th decades, respectively). When this ubiquity of microscopic prostate cancer is placed in the context of lifetime risks of clinical or fatal prostate cancer (about 10% and 3%, respectively for a man aged 50 years in the USA),5 these data indicate that local or distal progression of early cancer is far from inevitable within a man&#x27;s lifetime. Put another way, only a minority of prostate tumours are highly aggressive and life-threatening, while the majority are slow-growing and indolent.&quot;",1424573285

In fact during the Female Founders Conference today Jessica mentioned that there&#x27;s someone in the current batch who&#x27;s in their late 60&#x27;s.<p>Assuming you don&#x27;t squander your early years starting older has some advantages.  When you&#x27;re older you&#x27;ve likely built some domain expertise, have a better idea of what you want from life, and can support yourself better.<p>For example, I started in my late 20&#x27;s.  By that time I&#x27;d saved a lot of money, built steady passive income, was married (wife&#x27;s career keeps her busy), and didn&#x27;t have any kids.  Since most other areas of my life were taken care (especially financial) of I could pour myself into my startup without worrying about raising money or runway.<p>That said, remember that wanting to feel &quot;the excitement of a start-up&quot; is the wrong reason to join or start one.  Before quitting your job I&#x27;d highly recommend just starting a side project and do it for at least 6 months before making any major decisions.  It&#x27;s very unglamorous and odds are you won&#x27;t even launch a product, which is fine.  Better to learn that now than after you quit your job because 35 isn&#x27;t too old to start a startup but it is too old to be unemployed.",1424573200

Unfortunately, unless you work absolutely stupidly hard, you will end up at the same type of companies regardless of how much work you put into your resume.<p>Contributing to Open Source and having a top notch github/stack overflow profile are so overrated.

9087967,comment,9086501,9086501,0,0,o2sd98,,,"I&#x27;m recruiting at the moment. Having just gone through 153 resumes in a week, and 4 phone interviews so far, there are a number of things that will get you to the top of the resume list, the top of the interview list and the job.\nAs a potential employer, in my mind I am really asking myself the following of any candidate.<p>1. Is this person the solution to my problems, or another problem to add to my long list of problems? Or, will this person make my workload lighter, or heavier?<p>2. Does this person really want to work in <i>this</i> capacity, in <i>this</i> industry, doing <i>these</i> types of tasks? Or, are they desperate for work, and will use me as a stepping stone to another position and in 6 months I am back looking at 153 resumes again?<p>3. Does this person think first, and ask questions later, or the other way around? Questions that could have been answered with just a tiny bit of thinking are part of my list of problems. Great questions, honed to the crux of the issue, after thought and research are actually beneficial for me and the person asking, as they are opportunities to not only fix things, but improve the end solution as well.<p>Following on from this, if I were you I would redo your resume AND your interview technique with the above in mind. Your potential employer is a potential client of yours, and you are a micro business of one person. You need to convince your potential client that YOU are the solution to their problem(s), not another problem sucking down a paycheck.<p>How do you do this? Personally, I would recommend listing 2 or 3 problems you solved in each of your last positions. Being self-employed/contractor is no different to being employed. You are a small business, hired by your client to solve problems. So list them. If there are disclosure or confidentiality concerns, make your description of the problem and solution very high level.<p>I know this will probably sound strange, particularly in this particular forum, but nobody really cares what you KNOW, they care about what you can DO. When I read your story about getting 895/900 in the Security+ exam, what it tells me is that you can learn complex subjects in a short time frame. The mark is irrelevant to me, you might just have a very good memory. The REAL question I need answering, is can you put that knowledge to <i>practical</i> use. Will you protect my company&#x27;s network like it was your first born child? Or will you take advantage of the fact that I don&#x27;t really understand what it is you do and do nothing all day leaving my business at risk?<p>It&#x27;s not easy for technical people to do this, but you need to put yourself in your potential employer&#x27;s shoes for a minute. Imagine YOU own your own company, and you need a network guy to solve your security problems. You need this person to be capable, competent,responsible and reliable. You need to know that they wont leave you hanging in 6 months because this wasn&#x27;t what they really wanted to do, and they flit off to something else. How can you be THAT guy?",1424572824

Here, we realized that instead of having to pay a salary, or even a monthly fee, we could do it on a per-item basis.  I didn&#x27;t know how popular it would be, but it seems that other people in addition to me are interested in the idea of paying a premium on top of per-item prices in order to have them handled like magic.

Repeat.<p>You sound like me when I started. I would get paralyzed from choices on how to architect or implement something. It wasn&#x27;t until I just finally picked one did I learn what the tradeoffs were, what was just plain a bad idea, etc. I absorbed the experience and the next thing was easier.<p>Another thing. I can tell you like to talk. You can talk about a project, think about the project, muse about what it would feel like to be done with the project, as a substitute for doing work on the project.

But evaluating arguments -- especially unconventional ones -- is <i>really</i> expensive!<p>There is significant cost associated with evaluating an &quot;out there&quot; legal theory (in terms of research, opinion writing, etc.); it&#x27;s entirely reasonable for judges to not invest public time/money into a point-by-point analysis of an unorthodox legal theory, especially if that theory comes from someone without formal training.<p>Most professionals know that certain non-professionals <i>are</i> capable of doing their jobs, but also know that in the general case hubris is far more common than untrained competence.<p>The parent&#x27;s point was essentially this -- it&#x27;s not impossible to represent yourself, but it&#x27;s much harder than most people realize. Most judges aren&#x27;t willing to invest the time necessary to investigate/help articulate apparently crazy legal theories, and that&#x27;s both rational and justified. Explaining point-by-point why a crazy legal theory is crazy is not a good use of public time and money.<p>> Formal logic logic as far as reasoning about non-mathematical subjects is probably not that far from where it was in Aristotle&#x27;s days.<p>That&#x27;s my point -- typically &quot;formal logic&quot; means exactly deductions in/about formal systems. Wikipedia <i>redirects</i> &quot;formal logic&quot; to &quot;mathematical logic&quot;.<p>Law has no formal logic, and (edit: a lot of) what&#x27;s taught in law school pre-dates the advent of formal logic (late 1800s) by a hundred years.<p>The ability to prove soundness or completeness or first order logic (the sort of thing I would expect to appear in an introduction to formal logic course) is really completely irrelevant to the practice of law.<p>> the authors considered to be authorities Jurisprudence are, I think, very well informed in formal logic<p>This is simply not true, or else you have an uncommon definition of &quot;formal logic&quot;.",1424570526

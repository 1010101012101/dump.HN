8952081,comment,8950442,8951236,0,0,soroushjp,,,"Not sure about the biology, but there is some evidence from physics for this.<p>The speed of light is constant in a vacuum, but different for different wavelengths <i>in a medium</i>. This is why shining white  light through a glass prism causes it to disperse into many colors -- they each travel through the medium at slightly different speeds. Interestingly, the refractive index (how much the light slows down in a medium) is higher for larger wavelengths like red in the color spectrum. So technically, red light travels slower than blue or green light in a medium (eg. air, water etc.).<p>Of course I would delays in this would be absolutely tiny compared to delays due to neural processing .... but hey who knows, maybe we can tell the difference!",1422349162

(A partition key is optional in Kafka - the DefaultPartitioner just computes a random partition regardless of key.)<p>I am having trouble visualizing this in NSQ:<p>> [A server] might consume and acknowledge multiple messages to produce one new message<p>I can imagine a server consuming multiple messages and performing a single write to e.g. ElasticSearch or Cassandra - in this case it doesn&#x27;t matter that the batched write is a random subset of messages. But I can&#x27;t imagine consuming multiple messages and emitting another message - at least not without being able to reason about what partition of data was present on that server. For example, I can&#x27;t detect an abandoned shopping cart because a single shopper&#x27;s events will be scattered across all servers.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m thinking of this wrong - can you give a live use case for consuming multiple events and emitting a single message in NSQ?",1422348774

You know how you keep people from ripping the tags out?  You require manufactures to install them in every vehicle manufactured after September 1st 2007.  If people actually start tampering with this legally mandated safety device, lean on the states to add it to the vehicle inspection requirements... for safety.

I thought I was broken. I really did. I did my own research into numerous mental conditions because I actually thought i might have something deeply wrong with me.<p>Turns out, it&#x27;s mostly chemical. You have no idea how freeing that was to discover, to lay down those burdens and recognize that I&#x27;m just wired differently, and that my unusual wiring can be an amazing advantage if only I could control that one thing: where my attention goes.<p>First day on Adderall, and I literally felt like a superhero, I got <i>so much shit done</i>. I&#x27;m told that neurotypical folks who take Adderall just get revved up.<p>But if you have ADD, your brain either makes too little dopamine, or the re-uptake of dopamine is revved up. So your brain is constantly and subconsciously seeking the reward of novelty by taking over your normally conscious ability to direct your attention (something most people take for granted).<p>And Adderall changes that. It gives you the ability that most people have to control where their attention goes, even if the task isn&#x27;t particularly novel or exciting.<p>People without it just don&#x27;t understand how I can say I can&#x27;t control my attention, it&#x27;s such an alien concept to them. I <i>can</i> control it, as long as its focused on something exciting and new. Tasks were due &quot;now&quot; or &quot;not now&quot;, and &quot;not now&quot; just wasn&#x27;t very exciting for my brain&#x27;s wiring. Oh, look, a chicken!<p>It was literally a life changing decision for me. I never regretted it. Never felt like I was giving in. Never felt like I lost a part of myself to the drugs.<p>Hell, some days, I <i>still</i> feel like a superhero.<p>Get a referral if you need one to see a psychiatrist, unless your general physician is well versed in dosage and formulations for the stimulants (there are two major kinds and one may end up being significantly better for your particular wiring).

I have like 3000 lines of shell script to make containers, and maybe 800-1000 lines are related to debootstrap.<p>I have a cron job running daily on multiple machines, doing a deterministic debootstrap of Debian Wheezy on i386 and amd64.<p>It basically wraps debootstrap, strips down the image a bit, and stamps out the nondeterminism.  Every day it has gives a checksum for i386 and one for amd64, which holds across multiple host machines (one is Debian Wheezy, the other is Ubuntu Trusty).  So it is free from host influence.<p>The /etc/apt/sources.list just has the &quot;wheezy&quot; repo now (i.e. not wheezy-updates).  So Debian 7.7 had one pair of checksums, and then on Jan 10 2015, I noticed Debian 7.8 was released.  They changed that day, and have been stable/reproducible every day since.<p>Part of this is also mirroring the Release/Packages metadata daily and storing version history in Git.  One nice thing I found out about Debian through doing this is that the Release file completely describes the input, since it&#x27;s hashes all the way down (a &quot;Merkle tree&quot;, basically like Git itself.)  My scripts also make it so you can store versioned metadata in one tree, while keeping data immutable in &quot;pool&quot; (all this really requires is symlinks and file:// URLs for the repo).<p>What project were you working with in this area?

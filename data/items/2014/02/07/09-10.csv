It won&#x27;t save you from poverty, and it won&#x27;t make you rich. None of the moderately rich/high middle class people i know are well-educated. If they have anything in common then it&#x27;s that they are smart and sociopathic.<p>Education itself even doesn&#x27;t much improve chances to get a good career as an employee, most Ph.D. and MBAs i know are wasting their time doing mundane pseudo-intellectual work for meager pay. While i know senior and top management in  large and powerful corporations, earning ca. million a year, without any business or economic degrees (one of them has a programmer diploma by the way). Just people who have a habit of getting work done, reliable and proactive. Be like that and nobody will ask you which school have you finished.<p>Proof: median income of a Ph.D. is not even 2x the median income of an American in general.<p><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm</a><p>And Ph.D. are a high elite when an education attainment in concerned, under 50,000 are graduated each year, compared to 4.1 million Americans reaching age of 25 each year. So Ph.D.s are top 1.2% and getting under 2x as much as median. Top 1% population gets 1.6 million a year on average compared to under 50k median - a difference of about 30x. Even if you compare thresholds it is over 10x. So an highly elite education does not get you into a highly elite social class, or does not get you even a marginally comfortable life. It definitely gets you SOMEWHERE, but probably to a very, very low degree (difference is not even 2x if you remember that an average guy is mentally incapable of becoming a Ph.D. - he is just plain too dumb. so if someone capable of making it did something else instead he will anyways earn somewhat more than median guy will, it is impossible to tell how much more, but somewhat more for sure). In my opinion it is 1.5x difference max.",1391766025

(In December, Twitter flirted with a valuation of $50 billion despite having just 2,300 employees, while Dow Chemical, worth a similar amount, supported more than 23 times as many jobs.)<p>How is that a bad thing?  I think I&#x27;m going to call for Dow Chemical to hire 25,000 more people, hand them some test tubes, and shut down it&#x27;s manufacturing plants.<p>>>>  Silicon Valley might need to spend a far greater share of its treasure to maintain a general faith in its good intentions. It might need to wade more deeply into politics, not to secure tax breaks for itself but to force the development of affordable housing and transit in the Bay Area and beyond, so its neighbors don’t lose when it wins.<p>You can&#x27;t <i>make</i> housing affordable (other than making it less attractive).  You can subsidize it, which is a charitable thing to do, but the price didn&#x27;t change, just the person paying the rent.<p>>>> Were either company to lose the trust and optimism of its customers, it wouldn’t just be akin to ExxonMobil failing to sell oil or Dow Chemical to sell plastic; it would be like failing to drill oil, to make plastic.<p>This author has a very weird view of the world. People don&#x27;t use Google because they like Google, they use it because Google has solved entire swaths of problems that are very handy to have solved (like finding things on the internet, and email that isn&#x27;t awful).  Are there privacy concerns?  I guess, but honestly outside of people who complain about privacy as their actual job, people clearly don&#x27;t care even a little.<p>>>> If inventing new modes of communication or collaboration was seen as a mercenary act—as no nobler than drilling a well or devising a mortgage-backed security—then such platforms would never thrive, because their value tends to arise from a long, slow, unprofitable process of experimentation.<p>Anyone who actually understood the valley would see that not only is it the most mercenary place imaginable, but also that this is exactly how it should and must be.  Competition breeds efficiency and innovation.  You can start a company here and succeed exactly because you can compete on the same terms as the big players, and if you build something better it is very hard to stop you.<p>The message should be more &quot;hey idiots who seem to have time to stand around protesting that someone is using a bus stop, spend less time protesting bullshit and more time trying to make money if that is a major concern in your life&quot; and less &quot;making money means you have obligations to cough some up whenever anybody with less money notices&quot;.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ant_and_the_Grasshopper"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ant_and_the_Grasshopper</a>",1391764441

We didn&#x27;t have gangs and certainly didn&#x27;t have bad neighbourhoods (maybe 1 exception). It was a totalitarian state, and people were very afraid of police, but the surveillance was nowhere as pervasive as it is now in the U.S. (all the surveillance was done by people, not much technology).<p>After the Velvet revolution, it was always argued that the rise in the crime that followed was because it&#x27;s now less surveillance and less totalitarian. Fair enough. Later I visited Western countries and saw they have bad neighbourhoods and gangs, and a lot of surveillance. I have trouble believing that argument now.<p>The point is, <i>you don&#x27;t need all this</i>, and I want to get this out. History shows, there is <i>probably</i> a way how to structure society (I mean getting rid of gangs and bad neighbourhoods) without resorting to too much surveillance.<p>I think for a justice system to work, people need to have options. If they have option to have a good life, then they are less likely to commit a crime. I don&#x27;t buy this will reduce crime or gangs or bad neighbourhoods, because these people don&#x27;t have good options to begin with.",1391763769

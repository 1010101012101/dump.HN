6933155,comment,6932026,6933031,4,0,charlieflowers,,,"Yes, I agree. I&#x27;ve spent many hours working in both C# and Java and using JetBrains products to help me shape the code.<p>But C# and Java weren&#x27;t designed from the ground up around the primary goal of being amenable to such programmatic refactoring. So there are limits on what you can programmatically refactor.<p>But our industry has reached a point where &quot;rearranging&quot; large bases of working code might be a bigger, harder, and more important job than originally developing that code. So perhaps the most important characteristic of a programming language is its &quot;refactorability.&quot;<p>(Update - I think this sums it up: Would you consider working in a clunkier programming language if you knew that it offered 10X more &quot;refactorability&quot; than the other languages you were considering?)<p>Anyway, thanks for the comment.",1387432631

With an object-based method, you have (at least) a memory access to get the method object, a lookup in a vtable to find the location of the Invoke method and a function call (which means pushing a new stack frame) before you start processing the instruction. With the switch statement, none of that happens; instead, it compiles to (essentially) two jump instructions; one into a lookup table, then one from the lookup table to the opcode handler. Getting out of the handler and back into the loop is also a single constant jump (no stack frame popping).",1387432230

There&#x27;s nothing new here that Franzen hasn&#x27;t really already said.<p>Here&#x27;s a quote of his:<p>I think the Internet should be really strictly regulated, the way the airwaves used to be. If an entire region of the country had its main industry suddenly lose 90 percent of its paying jobs because of the predatory practices of a different region’s industry, you might, if you were the government, step in and say, “We can’t actually let this entire region starve. We’re going to subsidize prices, we’re going to redistribute some income.” Why should Apple shareholders be getting rich while working journalists are getting fired? This is an unjust situation, and the libertarians in Silicon Valley are either moral idiots or liars. They know they’re getting away with shit they shouldn’t get away with, and all they’ve got is this idea of libertarianism. That, and the mantra of making the world a better place.<p>If you think he&#x27;s a thoughtful person and he&#x27;s given a lot of time thinking about this, you&#x27;re wrong. He&#x27;s not thoughtful, he&#x27;s defensive about novelists and journalists, and brick and mortar bookstores.<p>If you read his articles and if you&#x27;ve read his books, you would understand his position on technology is a simple, not thoughtful, not deeply reasoned position. It is VERY black and white and often just wrong.<p>I&#x27;m only talking about his position on tech/internet. He&#x27;s a great writer and I&#x27;ve read everything he&#x27;s ever written. And will continue to do so. I&#x27;m a huge fan of his.<p>Similarly, I LOVE Walt Whitman. However, I wouldn&#x27;t take advice on the beauty of equations from Walt Whitman. It&#x27;s perfectly fine for someone to be a great poet, but has no ability to see the same elegance in mathematical equations. But to dismiss those equations, it reveals a certain ignorance.

I don&#x27;t feel strongly in either direction, although I have an aversion to silly and wasteful rules.<p>That said, in the case of mandatory warranty policy, I can definitely see some merit.  It definitely seems like certain appliances are being sold in a lemon market [2] (think blenders, etc), where the market is flooded with sub-standard, cheap products.  These can become the norm and set overly low price expectations, making it difficult for good products to compete.<p>How this applies to top-end smartphones is another discussion.  I don&#x27;t see why it should be difficult for a them to honor the policy, given their focus on quality.

When I moved to Washington DC, two friends who grew up just outside of DC always said I was a &quot;New Yawker&quot; in a NY City accent. With DC being 4 hours from NYC, I said then they must be as well because since I grew up 7 hours drive from the city and they grew up only 4 hours drive from the city.<p>Western NY, where I am from, is in the Finger Lakes region. It is full of rolling hills and long lakes. There are several cities here but many, many more pastoral small towns, much like New England. The &quot;tall&quot; part of NYS is home to Adirondacks region which is full of east coast sized mountains and small rustic towns, plus lots of wilderness areas. Adirondack park could actually fit Glacier, Yosemite, the Great Smoky Mountains, Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon Nationals parks all inside its borders. (Although that is a bit of a misnomer--there are towns, roads, businesses and homes technically inside the park&#x27;s boundaries. Some of those parks listed have nothing but parkland inside of them.)<p>I should say that between Buffalo, Syracuse and Rochester, I snobbishly say that I always refer to Rochester as nowhere near as boring as Syracuse or as depressing as Buffalo.<p>I never even went to NYC until I was 26 and by then I had been to England several times, 8 or 9 US states and 6 or 7 other major US cities.<p>Editorials time: I don&#x27;t like NYC. Many of the people are extremely egotistical about their city, it&#x27;s loud but not in a good way, crowded, dirty as hell and there are lots of shady areas. Granted it has a lot to offer but I feel the good/bad ratio is much worse than other cities. Washington DC for example is damn near as powerful and culturally rich yet isn&#x27;t anywhere as bad to look at or dangerous.<p>Also, don&#x27;t worry, plenty of people here in Rochester think Canada is pretty much Toronto and tundra, with some weird area near New England that wants to be France again. They technically know Canada goes all the way to the west coast, but but they don&#x27;t really think about it.",1387431948

One for software developer, one for hardware technician, one for system admin, one for entrepreneur/project manager. Then think about which resume to select for each job. Always write a cover letter that discusses your RELEVANT experience, and don&#x27;t hesitate to customize one of your resumes for a specific job. And leave out an old or unpopular stuff such as RPG IV. Oddly enough I noticed a job just appeared on careers.stackoverflow.com for someone with RGP III or IV experience, but it is the first time in 10 years that I have seen that stuff even mentioned. I thought it had died out in the 70s.<p>If you do want to apply for a job using old stuff like CNC then either make a special one-time resume or edit a stock resume that covers more recent manufacturing stuff. I know people still do CNC but my thinking is that in CA it is likely to be considered outdated since most manufacturing is now outsourced out of the state.",1387431163

6933034,comment,6932327,6932492,1,0,random_user,,,"> So it sounds like you have as much technical talent as anyone who&#x27;s launched a successful tech venture<p>Without any ego at all, I&#x27;d say, yes.  I may not be absolutely up to speed on every aspect of the cadre of web technologies out there but that&#x27;s not an issue.  I&#x27;m comfortable with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript/Jquery and PHP.  I am now switching to Python and Django due to a number of reasons not relevant to this discussion.<p>Can I code all of these technologies like a possessed monkey?  No.  My style is different.  I rely on reference material to support what I need to do.  I know what needs to be done and I get it done.  In other words, to throw out an example, I know when a state machine is the best way to solve a problem, I know how to design it and code it right the first time.  During that process I might need to look up language details here and there because in working with so many languages I decided a long time ago it was pointless to try and remember everythign about every single one of them.  I get to job done.  Now, if I am working on, say, Objective-C daily for weeks the reference material moves to the background pretty quickly as I don&#x27;t have to &quot;task switch&quot; between five different technologies in the course of a week.  Not sure if this is how young coders work at placed like Google.  Perhaps they do rock at the tools required for the entire stack, from server to client-side.  Or maybe they specialize and only do JS.  Don&#x27;t know.<p>> so will a com sci degree help?<p>I can&#x27;t see how other than, perhaps, if employers or investors place value in the credentials.  I understand that a degree is useful to establish a baseline.  At the same time, I can code FizzBuzz just fine and, apparently most CS graduates can&#x27;t code their way out of a paper bag.  Currently crunching through ProjectEuler.net as a neat way to get better at Python.<p>The one area that&#x27;s of great interest to me is machine learning and AI.  I&#x27;ve dabbled in it here and there but my work never landed me solidly in projects where I had to learn the material.  With all the new-found interest in robotics I find myself thinking that this is an area where I could do very well.  I mean, I am expert level at Solidworks and fairly decent at mechanical design and can also do all of the electronics and software.   I could see formal learning in ML being a good approach now that I am not busy trying to run a business from day to day.  Yet, I find myself asking if that&#x27;s reason enough to enter into a four+ year program when I could acquire the knowledge from one (or all!) of the excellent ML courses available online today.  I&#x27;d have to bone-up on statistics, calculus and linear algebra before I could jump in head first.  The difference is that I could do this on my own and only on the stuff I don&#x27;t remember rather than having to endure a year and a half of math towards a degree.<p>As you can see, I am fairly biased against the whole idea of going for a degree at this juncture.  Still, I want to keep an open mind and listen to reason before making a decision.  Because my wife is not an engineer I don&#x27;t think she understands what the landscape looks like for engineers my age, degree or not, any more than I might understand the nuances of her medical practice.<p>> I was in college less than a decade ago and we started with C<p>Right.  Most anything an engineer (software or hardware) will do today probably wasn&#x27;t taught in school ten years ago.  If you are not learning new things on a constant basis you&#x27;ll quickly become irrelevant.  As an interesting point, I do have friends around my age who have not kept up as I have and are pretty much done with engineering as it&#x27;s known today.  One of them actually stopped doing hardware and software about fifteen years ago and shifted into management.  He got laid off.  He is unemployed.  Nowhere to go.",1387429962

This $200k contest stunt seems to be a (very effective) marketing ploy which further distracts people from the fact that Telegram hasn&#x27;t demonstrated any desire to seek out professional cryptographers to examine their entire end-to-end pipeline for flaws.<p>It seems like the best possible thing they could do is to hire Matasano to fly out and dig through their whole architecture for flaws.

Telegram is claiming to be a trustworthy hero.

2768142,story,,,7,2,hurricane,"Ask HN: Feedback for SXSW Startup Contest (and paid project)",,"We are planning to run a startup contest for SXSW and need help and suggestions. We plan to ask startup participants to post a short video clip explaining their technology or a visual demo, then have an internet audience vote on their favorite entry. The top 5 startups would be flown out to SXSW, put up in a hotel, given free passes, and will be able to present to a panel of judges at a large event where a winner will ultimately be crowned.<p>We were hoping to run the contest through an additional page on our website www.thomvest.com and my initial thoughts on how we wanted to do this:<p>A clean design that shows small video clips as they are uploaded in either rank order by the number of votes or by latest upload. Was thinking that porting YouTube video might be best, but open to suggestions? I would think that for those entering there should be a few fields such as name, email, website url, and perhaps a posterous-like simple ""paste your video link"" that would automatically post onto the website.<p>For the users deciding on which startups make the final 5: a voting mechanism that would use Facebook and Twitter as login credentials to help reduce fraudulent votes. I realize that twitter will most likely contain additional spam accounts, so if it is possible to make some type of following/follower ratio requirement or number of tweets that would be helpful. I dont know if IP vote tracking would be difficult as well, but perhaps there could be an additional anti-spam layer through insuring the same connection doesnt vote multiple times. Some type of vote count tracker would be helpful as well.<p>Moderation tools that allow for curation of videos, potential to flag and invalidate spam votes as they come up.<p>I am sure there are other things I am not considering, and I would be open to hearing any other suggestions. While I have been searching around for other examples of a similar contest, I havent found many that fit the bill (I am most likely missing something so links would be appreciated). In addition, we are looking for someone that can code the above and has some ideas about the design, please feel free to send some information about your ideas and a price quote to info (at) thomvest (dot) com.

While these kinds of reframing techniques might have some impact, most people procrastinate because of subconscious motives they have rather than conscious ones. If you procrastinate to the point that it negatively impacts your ability to function effectively, by definition you have a psychological disorder (of whatever severity) and would do well to tackle that in some form of therapy.<p>Cognitive psychology might offer a more sophisticated version of this article's strategy, where psychodynamic would try to identify and work through the underlying cause of your motives not to work (e.g. part of you wants to experience the sense of crisis that comes from being incredibly behind on a deadline, so let's try to understand that part of you).",1310749039

Twitter and its constraints aren't silly.<p>An arbitrary and mostly-irrelevant technical limitation is responsible for the 140 character limit. But, it turns out that limit or no, 140 character messages have utility. Forced summarization means that you can benefit from updates from hundreds of people simultaneously.<p>Compare Twitter to the Facebook feed (I follow a comparable number of people on both). In neither case can I reasonably consume 100% of the stream. That's OK. But: I am objectively capable of benefiting from a far larger percentage of the Twitter stream than I am of the Facebook stream. I go two or three pages down Facebook and I'm saturated. I could never in a million years pay attention to it all day; I dip into it maybe 2-3 times a week.<p>The fact that Twitter sort-of works for this broadcast-y use case means that is sane to build things on it, like news services, or conference CFPs, or recruitments for open-enrollment classes, or announcements for new blog posts.<p>There are clearly things Twitter has wrong, and hashtags and inband metadata are clearly at the top of the list. But that doesn't make Twitter silly. The Twitter team apparently didn't know Twitter was going to work this well when they started it. It isn't some crazy scheme to trick the linkerati.

That said, as someone who might be reviewing your resume for the purposes of a job in the US, these are the things I would suggest improvement.

And as a sudden thought, why don't you use <a href=""http://aytm.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aytm.com</a> to have people from those countries review your resume for you. AYTM doesn't have to be just for testing your business model.)<p>I've been using Stackoverflow Careers for my resume lately. Take a look at the format: <a href=""http://bit.ly/muwOOl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/muwOOl</a><p>- Resumes should be good for scanning. And I can't scan this to find the key items I'd be interested in. In my resume, the key skills are easy to see at a glance. What I prefer to work with and what I loathe. Each piece of experience indicates the tech that I worked with and what I did there. Your resume includes your overall skills at the bottom, but they should be first, IMO. I should be able to see a snapshot of your pedigree within 10 seconds of scanning your resume.<p>- I started all my supporting details in my resume with verbs. You take action and these details need to show that. Specific stats are helpful if you have them...but don't embellish. Expect to be asked how you achieved specific stats. Use stats that have a reference point. ""Increased sales %10 year over year"" vs ""Grew sales 10% year over year, leaving the company with just over $30MM in gross sales per annum""<p>- What do you do for fun to further your professional goals? (Even just your casual activity could be an interesting data point which companies consider in the hiring process.) The fact that you organize events, regularly travel a few hundred miles to hit the slopes regularly, or even have a disciplined hobby shows unique character that companies look for to enrich their office culture.<p>- Constantly refine your resume.

How is it even <i>possible</i> to behave in a non-animalistic manner once you have internalised these ideas?<p>Look into the history of George Price, one of the key figures in actually developing a lot of the stuff that Dawkins popularised:<p><a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/George_R._Price"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/George_R._Pri...</a><p>The interesting part is how he spent the latter part of his life systematically giving away all his possessions to the poor in a guilt-ridden attempt to deny his own theories and to act against the interests of his genes. He eventually killed himself. The graphic method he chose to do so also comes across as an attempt to visibly deny his own ideas.<p>On an entirely separate note, all this talk of inter-gender differences is useless without some consideration of their scale relative to intra-gender differences.<p>Once you realise that the range in behaviour between members of the same gender is bigger than the difference in behaviour between members of different genders, by quite some way, this whole argument becomes a lot less compelling.",1310748505

I believe this process is called ""porting""(2) in Debian lingo but involves the whole distribution, i.e. just core libraries but driver frameworks as well. When I think of porting, I think of rewriting in another language. This is a patching job to me, massive as it may be, but whatever.<p>My information only comes from my research made the better part of a decade ago(3) when they were seriously looking to port the microkernel to L4 from Mach 4(4), but sadly it appears that work was abandoned around 2006 [Dunno, why? It might be started again]. I suspect the low level switch had a lot to do with interest in a better kernel in OS X than what Darwin(5), XNU(6) on the Mac, could provide(7). In the Panther, pre-Leopard days there was a lot of interest in this(8) kind of project: large-scale microkernels(9).<p>I don't know if this effort will include the port from L4(10) with the Mach abstraction API to ""save"" the prior work in getting Mach to work with standard Debian without the extra header requirements.<p>Anyway, I'm going to get some coffee and lunch.

You delay until you have a plan, but without a plan, you can't know if you have time to finish.  That -should- push you into making a plan immediately, but the whole enormity of the situation causes a panic reaction that prevents you from thinking rationally about the plan to start with.  In the end, you put it aside until you can deal with it.  It doesn't matter what reason (tired, no time, need something/someone, etc) you give, it all ends up the same.<p>The only way out of that kind (that I've found) is to seek help.

Imagine clicking on a mailto: link in your browser and being taken to email - while you're there, you read a few emails and end up back at your inbox.  You're done, and you're ""at the top"" of the app.  You want to get back to your browser.  How do you do that?  I've seen an email app that, under these conditions, pressing back makes you go through <i>every single email</i> you already read.  In other words, it traces you back through every single Inbox-->Email-->Inbox loop you ever did.  Not to mention what happens in the same app when you muck around the settings screen.  Be prepared to go visit the settings screen again!<p>The problem here was that there are two ways to go ""back"" when reading an email.  Press the back button, or clicking an on-screen UI element that took me back to the Inbox.  One of them pops an item off the undo stack, and the other pushes one onto it.  It's consistent, but frustratingly so.<p>I realize that I want to have my cake and eat it too, but at some point having an undo stack that is 30+ items deep doesn't really help me all that much.<p>I suppose it just goes to show that the meaning of Android's back button is way too overloaded (I think WP7 suffers from this across their other buttons as well).",1310747386

It's almost always possible for something to go wrong at any step.<p>3. Signed term-sheets are tricky.  Once signed, there's usually a ""no-shop"" clause (so you have to halt conversations with other investors).  Along side that, the termsheet is non-binding.  So essentially, the investor can back-out if they want.<p>4. Not sure how it's done in China, but here, if the first version of a contract does not match the terms in the termsheet, I'd push back hard and fast.

Note that this was written back in December, and it absolutely NAILS what's in the logs.<p>Second, here's the TL'DR for that link:<p>Lamo and Poulsen have been journalist/source for years. Poulsen met Lamo right around the time that Lamow as acting as the ""homeless hacker"" and being all leet by setting up fake Lexis Nexus accounts on the NYT's dime. Remember that?<p>Poulsen was also a pro-hacker back in the day: he intercepted a phone line at a radio staation so he could be the 100th caller and win a Porsche. Twice.<p>As such, Poulsen was able to connect with Lamo and use him as a source for years. It's Poulsen who made Lamo famous. And it was that fame that drew Manning to Lamo. Lamo is known, in the undergound 31337 hacker circles, to be gay. Manning, who was questioning his sexuality, saw this as a reason to contact Lamo, expecting some sympathy.<p>Of course, Lamo had since started working for the government, as any successful hacker can do once he's out of jail. The US likes hiring hackers for their team, and Lamo eventually turned in Manning to win points for himself in this capacity.<p>Poulsen surely kept Mannings info secret. The leak was entirely Lamo, as anyone who actually knows him can confirm. As I have said a few times in this thread; Lamo is a twitchy, untrustworthy little rat fuck. Despite being gay, he's had restraining orders taken out against him by women. He's that creepy and fucked up.<p>Not only was Poulsen not involved in outing Manning to the feds, he went all the way and protected Manning's privacy by holding these logs for a year, so far. As we now see, these logs are mostly personal, and there is nothing gained by us all reading them, except confirmation of what those of us in the ""scene"" already knew.<p>As the above-linked blog states: there is no conspiracy, there is only gayness. And thanks to Greenwald's incessant whining and conspiracy theory-mongering, we can all now read the very private conversation of a very troubled young man struggling to come to terms with his sexuality while working in an organization that, at the time, held homosexuality as tantamount to treason.<p>Oh, and we get to see more of Lamo's untrustworthy nature.<p>Good job, Greenwald. You just made things even worse for Manning: now the idiots who are already against him also know he's trans and has had a very difficult upbringing. Don't we all feel better now about locking him up in solitary?<p>Lamo hacked, he got hired. Manning hacked, he got publicly humiliated and will never be let out of jail. Justice, eh?",1310745796

MySQL is by a very long shot the most common pairing for PHP data persistence, unless the project is taken over by Microsoft (and drops support for anything but MSSQL) there's no way for such a thing to happen.<p>It simply is not a sensible interpretation of the headline.",1310745731

It is about hiring contractors that have paper credentials and then when shit hits the fan they can point to them and say ""look we hired the best, if they can't do it, nobody can."" In the government world is it about passing the security script test, having the right stamps on your cerificates that consist of random 4 letter words.",1310745700

I am not fortunate enough to have a family of my own, and since you mentioned the words 'mediocre work-life balance' please take my fifteen minutes of favour and go and spend them with your children. Have some real quality time together, do something really fun with them so that they get an extra quarter of an hour with their Dad, who would otherwise have been working.

It's probably still the case, since PDO is db-independent (PHP bundles a dozen of PDO db drivers in the standard distro) whereas mysqli is db-specific. Mysqli will also offer access to more db-specific features if mysql.<p>PDO has ditched the procedural style entirely (no PHP4 compat), has a smaller API and lets you use the same API for different DBs (across projects, so you'll hit a MySQL and a Postgres db using roughly the same query API).",1310745642

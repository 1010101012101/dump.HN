I&#x27;m not for U.S. or Russia, I see the Ukraine situation for what it is, a small country whose people are being manipulated by larger ones.<p>Russia&#x27;s move into Crimea isn&#x27;t even illegal, it was specified clearly in the terms of the treaty leasing the Russia naval base. It was also a defensive one. If Ukraine would join NATO, the lease for the base would terminate, and Russia will lose a naval port. Crimea was also historically Russian, the fact that Ukraine had it after Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse was pure accident; the Soviet Union &#x27;awarded&#x27; the Ukraine state with Crimea in 1954 as a meaningless proclamation, probably for domestic propaganda purposes. It was the people in Crimea who decided to join Russia.

The  respective local governments pay a subsidy to the transport operators when each card is used.<p>Anecdotally, the result is that people take public transport for &#x27;something to do&#x27;.  Going 120 miles on the cross-border train to Dublin because it is warm and they are bored at home ( they stay on the train when it turns-around ).  Catching the bus down into town to post a letter, instead of using the postal box at the end of their street.<p>I have been on buses to my work where I am literally the only passenger paying and I have had to stand on the journey, even at peak rush-hours.<p>On that basis I think that if public transport were made totally free for everyone it would also become unusable for everyone.

Thanks etix!<p>Several things I&#x27;d like to share here:<p>1. XMPP<p>Fastmail actually comes with a XMPP server. This is a big bonus feature that I didn&#x27;t expect. It can also keep chat logs in an IMAP folder named &#x27;chat&#x27;. Read more here: <a href=""https://www.fastmail.fm/help/clients/chat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fastmail.fm/help/clients/chat.html</a><p>2. External Account<p>If you want to manage other email accounts (receive emails from them), Fastmail seems only support POP (in contrast to Gmail supporting both POP and IMAP). Also, unlike Gmail which checks email with a dynamic frequency based on how many emails you receive at the time, Fastmail uses a fixed interval for checking emails from external account. The minimum interval you can set is 1 hour. I couldn&#x27;t find a way to manually trigger a POP check in Fastmail either.<p>One hour is a bit too long for me, but fortunately I adapted to a better way than using external account. I simply set an auto-redirect rule in my other email accounts (e.g. my school uses MS Exchange) and that actually results in instant delivery of emails from external account. I guess this is the right way to handle the problem (other than making your primary email service pull emails from external account like what I did in Gmail before).",1400992424

Prior to WWI, reinforced concrete gave rise to an era where networks of large forts could hold against any attack with proper coordination. Then early formulations of &quot;modern&quot; high explosives combined with advances in metalworking gave rise to artillery that could easily blast any fort to pieces.<p>Stealth worked well against radar systems lacking the computing horsepower needed to filter an aircraft out of the noise. Military hardware lags far behind the capabilities of consumer hardware since the rate of progression has been so rapid while military projects are planned over decades but if systems from 1998 are capable of tracking the latest in stealth technology the next few years will be the bookend of the stealth era.<p>Personally, I think the future will be an environment where swarms of small drones are thrown against these advanced radar systems in an effort to overwhelm their tracking capability.

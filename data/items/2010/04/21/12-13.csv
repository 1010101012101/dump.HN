It gets fairly complicated fast and mistakes can have huge ramifications for those that ever intend to move back. If you haven't filed you can go back and file them late. So long as you live in a country with a double taxation treaty with the US (most countries do, google it) and your local taxes are more than the fed wants you won't owe anything.<p>It gets worse if you work for yourself, i.e. I'm a freelancer, and so I get to pay social security and medicare no matter what. Also recent law changes have meant that you have to report any bank account with more than $10,000 in it. As to services of the embassy they charge for everything I've used them for, and it's not cheap, more annoying cause at least the Stockholm embassy won't take a US check or bill pay from Swedish internet banking, instead you have to get the equivalent of a cashiers check which is all but obsolete in Sweden.<p>I'm going to go dual citizenship this summer. I want to be able to vote in national elections and it will allow me to live and work anywhere in the EU, plus sometimes it's easier to travel on an EU passport. Sometimes I want to toss aside the US citizenship cause of the headache and expense of filing my taxes properly, but I wouldn't want to close the door on being able to return to the US easily either.<p>The whole tax citizens abroad is mostly based in a bygone era when rich people went abroad to avoid taxes.

I realized Processing.js was cool but I don't think it lends to raw speed as well as these games. I think I'll be making a lot more games in JS in the near future. Thanks for this link sandaru1.<p>Edit: Having looked into the source code... wow! For the ""capman"" game, he's creating the game map using ascii art and his ""help.js"" library has a function just for that: asciiArtToMap. This takes me back to the early 90s when making games meant you had to bitblt sprites and worry about every byte in the RAM. His library is great if you want to make sprite-based 2D scroller-type games but I don't know if it is easier to roll your own mini-library or use his for other types of games (e.g. puzzles). However, the source code itself is very extensive and I can certainly see the gamebox.font library being very useful for JS games.",1271852396

5329784,comment,5328812,5329034,2,0,ghshephard,,,"Caesar 3 was an absolutely amazing, amazing discrete simulation game - circa 1997/1998.  Another one, as good if not better, was Stronghold - a Castle simulation game.  What I loved about both of those games is that you would see the wheat being carefully sewn, then grown, then carefully taken up to the stock pile, people would take wheat from the stock pile and grind it up into flour, flour would then be carefully baked into bread.<p>All of this was just a crazy assed hyper detailed element of a game in which you were trying to defend your castle from invaders.<p>Final awesome discrete simulation game (on my iPad) was Settlers.  In this case, the tool/market chain was circular.  As eventually the ores and coal that you mined would be required for tools that like fishing rods that would catch fish to feed your miners, etc...<p>Those three games Caesar 3, Settlers, and Stronghold were the three best gaming experience in the last 15 years for me.<p>Still looking for #4.  We'll see if SimCity is there, I'm certainly hoping.",1362553179

None of them do anything other than appeal to the most base and traditional of consumerist norms: emotionally entice their target audience to spend their income on the service offered.<p>A parasite model.<p>Instead, imagine a company that offers a range of services based both on economy of scale, available resource by hour and user need.<p>Take the Tesla model: offer a luxury, yet newly innovative product which starts out as a high cost consumer item and work towards a more affordable, more widely available offering.<p>So you start a subscription service where you buy a block of available service hours. You can spend them on anything you want and switch it up each month.<p>Build a plan that started with an upfront payment for life evaluation.<p>* what is your situation?<p>* what are your goals?<p>* do you need your physical life organized?<p>* do you need a stylist?<p>* do you need an admin?<p>etc etc etc<p>You build out a profile of needs for N months - and build an intitial plan of action. From that baseline, you then have an available menu of services that the user can select from as needed. They do not have to use up their subscription hours and can accumulate hours for later/higher cost services later.<p>The company works to bring on 'task-rabbit' like folks for various tasks etc...<p>The goal is to allow people to focus on what they do without being gouged for premiums for any and every individual service they may need to maintain.<p>It's really sad that EVERYONE thinks that every service out there should net 100K+ (I took a cab to the airport and the <i></i><i>COST</i><i></i> to me as an individual was the equivalent to me paying someone $180K per year to drive me to the airport.

It would stop at this point because they weren't Physicists and didn't know about Quarks and Gluons.<p>Following many of these experiences, I though it always appropriate to ask probing questions, and continue to ask them until I understood a problem or situation fully.

Most had equal or greater education than my parents, yet when queried about aspect of their field that I knew they had deep knowledge of (eg. Ships engines from a Marine Engineer, Offshore tax havens from a Tax Accountant), they'd be very hesitant and often express ""why do you ask so many damn questions?""<p>In hindsight, perhaps this result was in part due to my lack of social awareness and emotional intelligence, but I swear it's imbued their offspring with fundamentally different characteristics. My friend's that had parents such as these have tended to follow more qualitative pursuits (Musicians, writers, journalists) while those with parents similar to mine ended up in strongly quantitative fields (Engineering, Maths, Science).<p>Obviously my experience is a single sample from the distribution, yet I wonder if others have observed a correlation between their own or others parent's attitudes towards answering their children's thorny questions and life / career attitudes?

I, as the organizer of the foundation, decide that I get US$80,000 as income for working at the organizer, and the rest is disbursed to the local animal shelter.<p>This is acceptable, legally. While probably not what you intend for the license, it seems like a good way for me to make some tax-free money.<p>Here is another technical difficulty. What if I am a company, who integrates source which earmarks 8 different non-profits. I charge $100/copy, I make 30 sales per month of which 30% goes to Apple, some goes to taxes, and some goes to my salary. What is the right way to split that revenue?

(For example, a local youth support non-profit might decline to accept money from an organization which advocates for the removal of pedophilia laws.) Can that commercial organization still be able to use the software?<p>If the software is free, and most of the revenue comes from in-app purchases, then does that count?

Dennis Crowley has been working on what has become Four Square since vindigo, which was a flat iron portfolio company that we invested in over 10 years ago. Jack Dorsey you know, came up with the original version of twitter back in the late 90's and he had been obsessed about that idea for almost a decade before he built it inside ODEO.

2721730,comment,2714730,2719563,1,0,breck,,,"I agree. The middle ground is better than writing no tests.<p>I do think it's more than a few minutes though. The problem is when you do a big rewrite you've now sometimes got a lot of failing tests. Do you go back and delete these tests and write new ones? Or refactor the test code? It's just a big distraction because sometimes you're ""holding the program"" in your head, as PG would say, and to worry about tests might cause you to lose your focus on the more important code.",1309619814

But I'm concerned that the pain of managing multiple friends lists will force one or two ""winners"" which try to be all things to all people: it's much easier to hook into Facebook's existing social graph than build a new one, but I honestly don't want Facebook to contain all my life.<p>Google+ seems to be trying the ""all things to all people"" approach as well, and I'm similarly skeptical of it at the moment. I'm still trying to feel out where it will fit in my own usage: if it finds a purpose other than just ""Facebook replacement"" I will probably use it, but otherwise it may be too difficult to escape the network effects.",1309619634

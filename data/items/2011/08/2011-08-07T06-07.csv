2856038,comment,2852723,2855232,2,0,kenjackson,,,"That assumes that infringement and innovation happens in a vacuum for Google.  I think we both know it doesn't.<p>For example, a mouse and a GUI dekstop with file folders seems extremely obvious to me.  But it's because I've been exposed to it.  A phone with a capacitive screen, appstore, multitouch, and an actual web browser seems like an obvious way to design a mobile phone now.  Using a mobile OS on a tablet seems obvious now.  Calculus, the periodic table, and DNA all seem obvious to me now too.<p>Google has already been exposed to innovation.  If Google came out of a rain forest in South America and just happened to have produced an iPhone with no human exposure in 2008 -- then sure I'd say maybe it was obvious.  But given they fundamentaly changed their design to largely copy it, after seeing the success of the iPhone, leads me to believe it wasn't independent invention.  But it was likely blind infringement (meaning they take no care to know if the IP is protected or not -- they copy everything with no sense of due diligence and just wait for the lawsuits).",1312700267

Think of the consequences... could mean love-making or worse!<p>Here's my not-trolling theory: When mistakes happen in projects, or there's conflicts, smooth resolution is statistically more likely when the group is all male or all female. Maybe there's studies done on this, I haven't bothered to look, so could be wrong.<p>It could also be true that mixed gender groups statistically do better with maintaining an already smooth operation. So as long as things don't go off the rails, the mixed gender group might be the way to go.<p>Some - hopefully few - female employees have it engrained that despite it being 2011, they are at an unfair disadvantage to begin with. This may influence, subtly or otherwise, their thinking and judgement at times of conflict with male colleagues, and possibly in their general approach to work life.

Of the eleventy-billion web-pages on the Internet, approximately zero percent of them are properly-validating, standards-compliant HTML. It takes person-years of labour, bug-reports and fixes to create a system that can reliably parse a web-page as the original author expected, and that barrier-to-entry was a pretty significant part of the original IE/Netscape duopoly.<p>Now, there's a plainly-described parsing algorithm in the HTML5 spec that handles conformant documents correctly, and non-conformant documents sensibly, and third-party implementations like html5lib[1]. Opening up a corpus the size of the Internet to interested individuals and researches has to be a pretty important achievement, I'd think.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/</a>",1312699034

The better rate means they spend less on interest payments, which decreases the chances of default. But the rate is itself used as a measure of the risk of default! So there is a feedback loop: high rates mean higher risk of default, and high risk of default justify higher rates.",1312697905

2855960,comment,2855717,2855717,4,0,shiftF,,,"Throughout my last 3 years I've used (in order): BlackBerry 9000, iPhone 3GS, Samsung Focus (WP7). \nEach one for almost exactly a year.<p>A year ago I made the hard decision between Android & WP7 and eventually went with WP7 for 3 simple reasons:<p>1) I love the UI. Clean, simple, to the point.<p>2) Responsiveness of UI. Every Android phone I'd played with (a year ago) didn't feel great. It felt slow, and clunky - almost as if smartphone CPU speed couldn't handle all that Android. WP7 felt fast, and I'm an impatient guy.<p>3) Effortless Social integration. BlackBerry had none. iPhone - I felt I needed to spend too much time looking for apps to get all the features I wanted. Ex: I had to download 3 different apps to: a) post quick facebook updates, b) sync fb contacts to my address book, c) view my friend's facebook updates. As soon as I set up my WP7, all my Google Contacts and FB contacts synced automatically, linked common data together, and I could see their FB updates all in one spot! I did nothing, and I had John Smith on Gmail & FB linked with email, phone, birthday, fb wall, and so on. Little things like this make me smile.<p>BlackBerry did my business well, but lacked quality apps and wasn't very fun.<p>iPhone did my business well enough, and was entertaining - but managing all those apps felt like a chore.<p>WP7 already did 90% the things I wanted to do, so I only needed a few more apps to handle minor things.<p>As Elop said - it's a battle of ecosystems, and with great dev tools & the XBOX Live brand, I took a bet that good apps/games would eventually come. \nSo far - I'm still happy (probably because I'm running Mango).",1312697488

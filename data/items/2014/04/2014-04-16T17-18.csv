Android, not too bad but not as much infrastructure as iOS (I&#x27;ll admit to being a much weaker Android than iOS dev, so maybe I&#x27;ve missed something) for gestures and the like.<p>Point being, even if the WinPhone accessibility APIs are fully fleshed out, 3rd party apps still need to support it, and I haven&#x27;t seen a big push from Microsoft to do so. Contrast to iOS where devs get the accessibility spiel at WWDC, and Apple seems to push it elsewhere. Android, meh, seems kind of tacked on IMO, though I guess it works well enough (fully-sighted user here, so I&#x27;m not the most qualified to say, and I&#x27;d be interested to know how the Nexus 7 works out for you).<p>Sometime in the next week I should get a chance to play with a friend&#x27;s phone that I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll have upgraded to 8.1. Again, I&#x27;m fully-sighted but have been the &quot;accessibility guy&quot; across several companies (including an accessibility lead at MSFT), so I at least know what to look for.

Management wasn&#x27;t happy.<p>Trying to be helpful, Management bought 6 more wagons.<p>The team said that with 4 team members, they couldn&#x27;t productively use more than 4 wagons.

Management wasn&#x27;t happy.<p>Trying to be helpful, Management set a deadline, and gave a speech about how important the deadline was to the company.<p>The deadline was completely unrealistic.  The team worked to move bricks as fast as it could.  After moving about 3 tons of bricks, they missed their first deadline.  Management wasn&#x27;t happy.<p>Trying to be helpful, Management set a deadline, and changed the goal to be to move the bricks 60 yards.<p>The team was pretty happy for a while...  Until they realized that management wanted them to move those first 3 tons of bricks BACKWARDS 40 yards.  They tried to explain that this was like moving 3 * 140 + 7 * 60 = 840 brick-ton-yards, rather than 7 * 100 = 700 brick-ton-yards, and was therefore an even harder goal!  Management wasn&#x27;t happy.<p>Trying to be helpful, Management hired a consultant.<p>The team was told to stop moving bricks for a while, and talk about everything with the consultant.  The consultant gave some fun presentations, and coached the team through a lot of soul searching...  They decided to have stand-up meetings every so often, to talk about their progress, and their plans for the day.  The meetings took more time, and bricks weren&#x27;t moving themselves.

Management wasn&#x27;t happy.<p>Trying to be helpful, Management bought 7 tons of gravel, and dropped it the 0 yard line, and said the new goal was to move the gravel 75 yards.  They also hired an offshore team, but all they could really do was try to dial in to conference calls at weird hours of the day, and they really couldn&#x27;t help move any of the gravel.  Then one of the Managers was fired, and the new Manager said the goal was to move 1 ton of bricks and 2 tons of gravel 186 miles, in the back of an El Camino, that has no tires and no engine, and there&#x27;s no budget for either...<p>...then some manager four levels up in the company decided to spend enough money to rent a few pieces of construction equipment, brought in an external team, and moved all 7 tons of bricks and all 7 tons of gravel the whole 186 miles in record time.

The button click example would be quite easy to handle, even without Zones, if the button had an onClick event stream, rather than taking a callback.<p>This code, which doesn&#x27;t work as intended:<p><pre><code>  function thirdPartyFunction() {\n     function fakeXHR() {\n       throw new Error(&quot;Invalid dependencies&quot;);\n     }\n \n    setTimeout(fakeXHR, 100);\n   }\n \n  function main() {\n     button.on(&quot;click&quot;, function onClick() {\n       thirdPartyFunction();\n     });\n   }\n \n  main();\n</code></pre>\nwould instead look like this with a Streams-based API (I&#x27;m assuming a Dart-like API, since I don&#x27;t know the proposed Stream API for JS):<p><pre><code>  function thirdPartyFunction() {\n     function fakeXHR() {\n       throw new Error(&quot;Invalid dependencies&quot;);\n     }\n \n    setTimeout(fakeXHR, 100);\n   }\n \n  function main() {\n     button.on(&quot;click&quot;)\n       .listen(function onClick() {\n         thirdPartyFunction();\n       })\n       .onError(function onError() {\n         console.log(&quot;now it works with errors&quot;);\n       })\n   }\n \n  main();\n</code></pre>\nSince onClick is executed by the Stream, even a synchronous exception in thirdPartyFunction will be caught and given to the onError callback. JavaScript could really use a better DOM API with Promises and Streams in place of most callbacks. I think most of the Streams work is here: <a href=""https://github.com/whatwg/streams"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/whatwg/streams</a><p>So Zones aren&#x27;t really needed here. They are very useful though. AngularDart uses them to intercept any external trigger of the event loop so that it can run it&#x27;s change detection code (this is why they ported Zones to JavaScript). Dart&#x27;s unittest library runs each test in a Zone to wait for outstanding microtasks and catch async errors that might happen after a test appears to have completed and associate it with the correct test. And of course using Zones to string together async stack traces or debugging is invaluable.",1397669346

7599081,comment,7592278,7597604,1,0,Jweb_Guru,,,"I will disagree with you on your first point.  One of the characteristics of specialists is that they know in practice how the software in which they specialize interacts with other software, where a generalist might not.  For example, most specialists in any performance-critical software are pretty intimately familiar with the behavior of the Linux kernel when it comes to things like I/O scheduling and cache eviction, because of how it affects their program of choice.  Generalists, on the contrary, rarely know any part of the system in enough depth to be able to quickly diagnose such problems.  Often companies without suitable onsite expertise will reach out to specialists in these situations to resolve such problems.<p>I&#x27;ll agree with your second point, to some extent.  Generalists are rarely tied to any one technology and therefore can be very good at getting your organization to use the right tool (avoiding the common &quot;hammer-nail&quot; problem).  However, just as frequently, I see generalists picking the <i>wrong</i> tool for the job, because they again aren&#x27;t intimately familiar enough with the tools already at their disposal to understand all their capabilities or be able to make an informed decision about whether the gains of the new tool are worth the added complexity of introducing another layer to their stack.  And, of course, nobody feels the pain of adding extra layers to the stack quite like DevOps do.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what to make of your third point.  Isolated processes talking to each other is just a different strategy from a monolithic design.  There are advantages and disadvantages to each.  It&#x27;s unclear to me that monolithic means &quot;better designed,&quot; and in fact there are good security arguments to the contrary.

I have to recalculate my last year&#x27;s tax liability based on a lower deduction (because AMT may or may not erase the deduction anyway).\n- It tells you that you have a slightly increased audit risk for one of about 5 different reasons, that are mutually exclusive and only one of them applies to my return.<p>This is the stuff that a computer can do very well, but is tedious and error-prone for me.<p>Moreover, the last time I used TurboTax and I&#x27;m sure this is true with TaxCut still, it wants me to decide if I want to file jointly or separately.

In particular, they detail an escalation that Levison himself provoked:<p>* The DOJ reached out demanding metadata regarding (presumably, and let&#x27;s just stipulate) Snowden&#x27;s use of Lavabit.<p>* Levison rejected the request, on the auspices that Snowden had enabled the &quot;storage encryption&quot; feature of Lavabit.<p><i>Here it&#x27;s worth knowing that Levison had previously complied with similarly narrow requests.</i><p>* Levison confirmed to the DOJ that he had the ability to circumvent the storage encryption.<p>* The DOJ responded to that concession by doing exactly what anyone would have expected them to do: they escalated their demand to include the decrypted Snowden data.<p>* The DOJ spent <i>eleven days</i> trying to meet with Levison, who stonewalled them; Levison &quot;ignored the FBI’s repeated requests to confer&quot;.<p>* Only upon being threatened with a contempt citation did Levison actually enter a productive discussion with the DOJ.<p>* Four days after being threatened with contempt, Levison presented the DOJ with a proposal to charge the DOJ $2000 to design and implement his own pen/trap system which would provide data to the DOJ <i>only at the conclusion of the order&#x27;s time window</i>, with timely updates being provided only at Levison&#x27;s discretion and only with an additional charge attached.<p>* Only <i>after</i> this sequence of events does DOJ demand the TLS keys that would have compromised all Lavabit users activities.<p>Levison&#x27;s attorneys and the DOJ litigated the question of whether the pen/trap order required him to cough up his TLS keys. But that only happened after Levison did his best to deter the DOJ from collecting information about Snowden. As evidence for this: the DOJ eventually did install a pen/trap device of some sort, without the TLS keys, and attempted to use it to collect evidence. Had Levison complied with the DOJ productively from the beginning, he probably could have worked with them to produce the information they required without compromising the rest of his users.<p>I already had a problem with Lavabit as an inept and dangerous privacy solution (you can obviously see that it was; Levison was trivially able to subvert the privacy of all of his users, and was eventually forced to do so).<p>But almost as bad as that is his handling of the legal situation here. Read the language of the decision carefully and you&#x27;ll see that had Levison simply began this process with his proposal, minus the time lag problem, but perhaps even including the price tag, he might have had that solution accepted! Instead, he seems to have seized an opportunity to poke a giant bear with a stick. The bear then ate him and his users.<p><i>Later: Also, bad facts make bad law.

This all sounds really sensible.<p>Concerning rcron, you don&#x27;t actually need explicit support for it, as it&#x27;s just part of the scheduled command. However, some integration could make it obscenely pleasant to use. Probably, i would need to manually set up rcron on a group of servers, then configure some sort of &#x27;virtual server&#x27; in the hub which contains the servers in the group. When i schedule a job on the virtual server, it is added to the crontabs on all the real servers, but guarded with rcron, so it only executes on one. The reporting would then deal with the fact that only the master in the group actually runs the job: if the rcron wraps the minicron, then it would deal with the fact that only one server sent a report; if the minicron wraps the rcron, it would just hide the empty reports from the non-master servers.<p>We currently manage most of our cron jobs through Puppet. If we adopted minicron, we&#x27;d want to keep doing that. That means we would write a Puppet defined type which adds a job in the hub. It would be really useful if there was an API, or ideally a command-line tool, to do that. It would be nice if there was then an easy way to distinguish Puppet-managed and interactively defined jobs in the hub, so that people didn&#x27;t attempt to fiddle with the Puppetted ones. Maybe a flag that makes them read-only in the UI, but allows them to be managed in the API? That&#x27;s probably something we would address in a fork if we did adopt minicron.<p>Some kind of auditing for changes to job definitions would be useful. We currently use Jenkins for ad-hoc scheduled jobs, and our very weak audit trail for it is a recurrent pain point. Would it make any sense to keep job definitions in a Git repository? Might be quite a pain to provide an interactive UI on top of that, though.",1397667695

Not because it furthers society or any such weakminded claptrap, but because it affords one more place where rent-seeking behavior is not only condoned but explicitly encouraged.<p>It's my fervent opinion that rent-seeking behavior and similar economic dysfunction is one of chief underlying problems with economy and with society as a whole.  OWS isn't objecting to rich people in general - just to rich people whose modus operandi is to drain resources from everybody while never giving any back.  There's no thought for the larger consequences, and the law permits it only because most people have so far been more or less well enough off that they don't need to bother with it.<p>It's all coming to a head now, though.  Or so I damn well hope.<p>I agree wholeheartedly with your bitterness here; this is precisely my beef with the patent system as misapplied to software - but the truth of the matter is that mechanisms like Kickstarter would be a great way out of our societal bind, while their actual success makes them a target for leeches.",1319230086

Managers effectively are stuck with blinders; their one and only job, and often the only thing they know how to do (frequently through surreptitious or less-than-stellar means), is to keep their team and/or department sitting pretty in terms of normal company metrics. This correlates both to the resource allocation given a team and the rewards allocated specifically to the individuals that comprise that teams (including the manager, of course), which is why people appreciate ""good"" managers, until something unanticipated comes up and is killed by this rigid process.",1319229983

Some of the most impressive things I've seen in the last year were JavaScript sites that had nothing to do with even the slightest shred of DOM manipulation.<p>Of course I'm not saying that one shouldn't need or want to understand the DOM.

For example, what if you don't want Unity but do want Firefox 7?  Or do want updated indicator applets, but don't want broken wifi because of a driver bug in 11.10?  (Personal experience, that one.)  Your only option is adding PPAs, hoping there's a .deb, or compiling from source, all of which are beyond an average desktop user.  And even if you do that, if you wait long enough the distro will have advanced so far away from your personal setup that upgrading other things will become a nightmare.<p>Linux should move away from the monolithic distro paradigm and towards a stable, rarely changing core of essentials like compositing, video, wifi, hibernate, etc., with optional highly updatable packages of ""smaller"" software like Banshee, Firefox, etc.  That way you can have the best of both worlds: stable core software that the user never sees, and individually updated smaller software that the user wants to be fresh.",1319228848

I didn't document the 3-4 lines it takes to load the file and get the object I need. Why? Because it's just how you load a file. Anyone could figure out that out from the documentation. It's already clear what I'm doing: loading a file. And why I would want to do that is obvious given the intent of the program: the whole program is created to perform some operations on files.<p>I do, however, document why I'm changing the working directory of the program to the folder the file is in. Because the program always saves to its working directory when you call Save from the API, which is not at all obvious or documented in the API.<p>For one rule (certainly not the only one): anything you had to figure out through trial and error is non-obvious.<p>It might be interested to collect some example of things programmers decided to or not to document and explanations for those decisions.",1319228788

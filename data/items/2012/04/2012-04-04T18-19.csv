By purchasing Motorola and operating it separately they can produce phones with shorter wait times between Android version releases and updates, and set precedents for other manufacturers to follow.<p>Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and a myriad of other platforms have proven that social is a huge market.  Google+ was late to the party, but they would be stupid to ignore it altogether.<p>Google Offers is a natural tie-in with a mobile payments platform (Google Wallet), which they were essentially first to market with in the US despite having not yet gained significant traction.<p>I'm not very familiar with the Google Places, Hotpot, or Yelp services, but it seems like a natural tie-in with their existing Maps service.  And sure, MapQuest was around first, but it still is, and I don't know anybody that prefers it to Google Maps.<p>Chrome may seem ""me too"" at the moment, but when it first released it was a pretty big deal.  They proved that browsers could be minimal and functional, and as they said themselves it only made sense for them to contribute to the web at all points, from server to client.<p>Google Docs took Office products into a completely new space, one which Microsoft is now having a knee-jerk reaction to with their Office 365 platform.<p>On top of that, there's plenty of originality to be had still.  Their self-driving cars project is really taking off, just a few short years ago nobody would ever have dreamed it would be possible to have a street-level view of nearly every road in the US (and tons of other countries now), their single account/sync structure is undoubtedly the inspiration for iOS's recent iCloud service, and they're in the process of revolutionizing internet connectivity itself right now with end-to-end fiber connections at reasonable consumer pricing in Kansas City.<p>Maybe there is a bit of envy in there, but who hasn't looked at something and said to themselves ""I could do better""?  I'd say that, for the most part, they have.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)</a>

The normal approach for moving data with PHP is to readfile() the whole file into a byte string in memory before echo()ing it to the user; doing something chunked, incremental, and seekable is probably just as much difficulty in PHP as in Perl. It also isn't legacy -- as they say, they switched from Perl to PHP. (Although, it might be. They may have switched to PHP just for the library MySQL functions, or perhaps they wanted to switch to Nginx and couldn't get it at the time to run exactly how they wanted with Perl -- either way, it could be the case that now they're staying with it for legacy reasons.)<p>I can think of some special cases where PHP would be better, especially in a porn site's case -- the most common clicks are front-page links and there are probably a bunch of common keywords and clicks to links off the first page of those searches, which means that caching whole pages is probably economical. As far as I know, both Perl and PHP are identically suited to talking with upstream caching proxies, but PHP might have felt more natural for day-to-day feature development.",1333565639

3799175,comment,3798763,3798763,104,0,SystemOut,,,"<i>sigh</i> The article makes it sound like these sites are doing everything themselves including pushing the bits.<p>Maybe some are but I can say from personal experience that most of your traffic, if you're smart, comes out of a CDN.  The sites themselves are definitely not that interactive which makes them simpler to publish.  The pages are almost all cached and that doesn't take much horsepower to serve up. The big video sites have ratings and comments but they are not that big of a deal.  People go to watch porn sites to watch porn, not interact.  Customer analytics have shown that over and over.<p>I know of virtually no porn company that handles their own transactions, either.  They all go through billing companies that handle things like PCI compliance for them.<p>Most sites also use a system like NATs to do their affiliate management.  You need one that the affiliates trust isn't shaving sign-ups from their account.  They tend to trust NATs.<p>For the data on the backend you just have a SAN to manage the data or you just manage it on a few servers with lots of disks but if you are really at the 100TB mark then you get a SAN I would think.  That's what we did.  Sure, it's a lot of space but they're big files so managing them isn't that hard.<p>I'd say the largest issue that a company like YouPorn will have is the amount of data in their working set for a CDN.  CDNs generally charge you for the size of your working set that they keep at each POP in their network so you want to keep it as small as possible.<p>At the end of the day running a large porn network is more about integrating the myriad of partners you need to run the network.  The infrastructure is interesting for a while but once you have it working the business of doing deals and handling promotions and figuring out why integration point A isn't working like it should is what keeps you busy.",1333565368

3799132,comment,3792627,3792627,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"I've put some thought into metrics as well.  A few other alternatives suggest themselves:<p>- Considering the standard deviation of ratings.  On a 5 point scale, an item that rates 3 because ratings are split between 1 and 5 votes, differs from one that gets mostly 3 votes.  The latter is a middlin' fit for anyone, the former has an enthusiastic but niche audience.  If you're looking at sales, the former can be a valuable product if properly marketed.<p>- An item that gathers few votes regardless of favorability ratings can exhibit multiple problems.  One is that it isn't well marketed / publicised, or known.  Another (particularly on content sites) is that there's very likely a sampling bias (mutual admiration society / negging attack / vote stuffing).  I've tended to favor systems which take into account the total volume of voting, generally on a ln(n) basis, though not out of any particular statistical rigor.  As an implementation, you'd start with a 5 point Likert score, then multiply by, say, ln(n+1) (avoiding a zero multiplier on a single vote).<p>- The pattern of ratings over time and space (IP or geographical) may reveal both opportunities for marketing and/or issues with your ratings system.  Since any effective quality proxy <i>will</i> be abused, you've got to be sensitive to the latter.<p>The Wilson score is an improvement over multiple other methods.  It still does assume a relatively unbiased estimator and rating behavior.  My feeling and experience is that excess reliance on any one metric is likely to cause problems -- reality is multidimensional, metrics for assessing reality should be as well.<p>There's also the question of whether or not you want to make specific recommendations for an individual, or general recommendations for a population.  In the former case, correlating other rankings or behavior may give a better fit (and the Wilson score may still be useful).<p>Though for a suitably specific goal (marketing, suitability, revenue potential) a single encompassing metric may work.",1333564833

Or use a ""bank"" (but I don't like it because any centralization is against the design principle of Bitcoin).<p>For example, Bitcoins could be stored on a smartcard having a flexible e-paper display, flexible built-in keypad, and flexible LiPo battery [1]. Withdrawing coins from the card could require a user typing in an amount and a pin code, and then using a smartphone to scan a QR code shown on the e-paper display (or sliding the card in the merchant's payment terminal, which would scan the QR code). The QR code would represent a signed Bitcoin transaction to a pre-programmed address whose private key sits on some online server, which is only used as an intermediary step before forwarding the coins to the final merchant. The smartcard would effectively never connect to an online device during its entire life, making it un-hackable without having physical access to it. Smartcards could also be manufactured in pairs, or triplets, etc, to have clones of them in order to have redundant backups of the Bitcoins in case of a loss of one of the cards. If you know about the Bitcoin blockchain, you might ask how the smartcard can sign transactions without access to the current blockchain. Well it is mathematically possible, because a transaction just consists of ECC-signing a few bytes representing the destination addresses.<p>Don't discard a technology because you are unable to comprehend it enough to think of solutions to address some of its flaws. (I do agree that addressing the security of Bitcoin wallets is of utmost importance.)<p>[1] The technology for this already exists.

  // A: try/catch inside loop
  global.a = function () {
      for (var i=0; i<lots; i++) {
          try { } catch (e) { }
      }
  }
  
  // B: one try/catch, inlined loop
  global.b = function () {
      try {
          for (var i=0; i<lots; i++) { }
      } catch (e) { }
  }
  
  // C: one try/catch, loop in local function
  global.c = function () {
      var loop = function () {
          for (var i=0; i<lots; i++) { }
      }
      try { loop(); } catch (e) { }
  }
  
  // D: one try/catch, loop in top-level function
  function loop () {
      for (var i=0; i<lots; i++) { }
  }
  global.d = function () {
      try { loop(); } catch (e) { }
  }
  
  // E: no try/catch
  global.e = function () { loop(); }
  
  global.time = function (times, fn) {
      var start = new Date().getTime();
      for (var i=0; i<times; i += 1) { fn(); }
      return (new Date().getTime() - start) / times;
  };
</code></pre>
In the REPL:<p><pre><code>  > ({ a : time(100,a), b : time(100,b), c : time(100,c), d : time(100,d), e : time(100,e) });
  { a 7.66 b 5.29 c 5.06 d 1.45 e 1.32 }
</code></pre>
So a million try/catches (A) is bad. But hoisting the try outside the loop (B) or putting the loop into a local function (C) doesn't do nearly as well as putting the loop in an outside function (D), which is almost as fast as no try/catch at all (E). I tried a few variations (like making the loop actually do some work) and the outcomes were all comparable.<p>This clarifies and confirms what ef4 said: don't put cpu-intensive code inside the same function as a try/catch. Put it somewhere else and call it. Also, local functions don't necessarily count as ""somewhere else"".",1333562999

That was it. We just shoved the encrypted user token and timestamp into a domain cookie.<p>But I guess we should have also signed the encrypted value to know that we generated it?<p>What's the process to break this scheme?<p>1) Know what type of value is being encrypted: email, username, tokenid
2) Gather several pairs of usernames/encrypted usernames
3) Use some brute force method to uncover the key and IV
4) generated fake cookies since you know the key/IV",1333562582

We made a mistake"" and the real results were much worse than they originally said, which makes the stock price drop.<p>I think it is a valid approach because a company should be able to get its own accounting correct. However, based on the creative accounting from Groupon (and other issues) I'm really surprised the FTC allowed them to have an IPO to begin with.",1333562577

8101397,comment,8099713,8100365,2,0,dmacvicar,,,"Java developers kind of laugh when I explain them that Linux distros struggle to bootstrap Maven from source due to being a non-trivial tool that depends on hundreds of artifacts to build.<p>The point is, what do you care that your repo is local, or that your jars are secured, if the tool you got maven itself  in binary form, from a server you don&#x27;t control?<p>That is the whole point of Linux distros package managers. It is not only about dependencies. Is about securing the whole chain and ensure repeatability.<p>Maven design, unlike ant, forces you to bootstrap it from binaries. Even worse, maven itself can&#x27;t handle building a project _AND_ its dependencies from source. Why will the rest of the infrastructure be important then?<p>Yes, Linux distros build gcc and ant using a binary gcc and a binary ant. But it is always the previous build, so at some point in the chain it ends with sources and not with binaries.<p>And this is not about Maven&#x27;s idea and concept. If it had depended on a few libraries and a simple way of building itself instead of needing the binaries of half of the stuff it is supposed to build in the first place (hundreds), just to build itself.",1406627497

This means that you get a higher resolution as well as a higher framerate, but on the downside seems to introduce additional artifacts depending on how these two interpolations interact.<p>I have not yet read the technical paper and only watched the video without sound, but from this video it seems that moving sharp edges introduce additional artifacts (can be seen when looking at the features of the houses in peripheral vision at 5:11 in the video). This is what you would roughly expect to happen if both pixel grids try to display a sharp edge, but due to their staggered update, one of these two edges is always at a wrong position.<p>This problem could probably somewhat alleviated through an algorithm that has some knowledge about the next frames, but this would introduce additional lag (bad for interactive content, horrible for virtual reality, not so bad for video).<p>I intend to read the paper later, but can anyone who already read it comment on whether they already need knowledge about the next frame or half-frame for the shown examples?",1406626900

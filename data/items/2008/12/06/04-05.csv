387864,comment,387789,387835,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I found writing to pay too little for too much effort.  But, then, I only have the one book published.  And, to be fair, I do still get a few hundred dollars in royalties every quarter five years later.  So, I guess if I were to write a stable of books over the span of a few years, it could probably turn out to be a reasonable income.  But then, it wouldn't be very passive, would it?<p>New editions of existing books is an interesting twist, though.  Did you write the originals?  If not, how did you end up doing the updates for later editions?  (I'd be kinda ticked if my publisher didn't come to me first for a new edition of my book, for example...and it's one reason I didn't write a second book...the apress contract actually had a weird provision about not needing any permission from the original author to release new editions, and granted them the ability to do odd things to the royalty structure for subsequent editions.)",1228539334

387857,comment,387495,387629,0,0,snprbob86,,,"Hopefully, if the library designers are doing their jobs, you aren't hunting through class hierarchies. Instead, you should be falling into a pit of success.<p>That is, some path to your solution should always be immediately obvious and that simplest path should always be the correct one. Clearly an unachievable goal in the general sense, but surprisingly doable overall in statically typed languages. One example: I know I have to call A.F(B), so I know that I need to construct B, which offers B.ctor(X) and B.ctor(Y), but I don't have an X, so clearly I need B.ctor(Y) ... etc. IntelliSense would have pointed you right to it!<p>I used to have a tendency to thumb through IntelliSense (and sometimes I still do!), but have taken to reading the docs before starting because most of the libraries I interact with are just too complex! The real problem is, that the majority of code that I consume isn't documented at all anyway, so hunting through the class hierarchies (or code directly) is all I've got.<p>For the record, my tools are: C/C++ = Visual Studio and Source Insight; C# = Visual Studio with Resharper; Java = IntelliJ IDEA; Python = Wing; Javascript = <i>gggrrrrrrrr</i>; XML, HTML = Notepad2; Other text files = Notepad2 or Visual Studio; whichever has the focus :-)",1228538639

Even if the few supported operations like rename/pull up/inline/extract are only a subset of all possible refactorings, I still do these things multiple times an hour. I want them to be automated.\nI hate bloated IDEs just as much as the next guy, but I do miss automated refactorings when in vim or emacs.",1228538602

The problem is that it doesn't help you read and understand repetitive code.<p>The fact that a repetitive and error prone task needs to be done at all is sometimes (not always, I acknowledge) a sign that your code is redundant and, well, crappy. I think it's a good idea to step back and decide whether the redundancy is legitimate. An IDE doesn't encourage that kind of thinking. Remember, someone after you has to go and read that code, and the IDE is not going to hide the redundancy from him or her.

387831,comment,387495,387610,0,0,sofal,,,"There are both kinds of developers. I always thought Oliver Steele did a good job of explaining this here:<p><a href=""http://osteele.com/archives/2004/11/ides"" rel=""nofollow"">http://osteele.com/archives/2004/11/ides</a><p>Here's my take:<p>The ability to write in a language that doesn't require excessive amounts of boilerplate code means I'm much more likely to refactor as the code evolves. Seeing an algorithm on one page, localizing and separating the logic cleanly with higher level constructs, easily translating the intuitions in my head to a coded solution, being able to dive into any part of the code without getting lost in the redundancy and residue of IDE vomit, etc... is all really valuable. Getters and setters that take up more than one very short annotation are eyesores, and the mere act of coughing them up into the code was never a bottleneck to programming speed no matter how bloated they get.<p>The act of automatically renaming classes or variables, along with all the other code-shoveling refactoring support that IDEs provide is a miniscule subset of what refactoring is really about. The real refactoring work is done in your head. You need to look at the code and comprehend it in ways that aren't obvious, so that you can reorganize it to be simpler or maybe extendable. This kind of work cannot be done by an IDE; however, it can be aided by using a nice expressive language that gets to the point and doesn't distract you from the problem.<p>When it comes down to building, deploying, and automation of other menial tasks, I'm not stuck with what the IDE developers give me. A good language is like putty in my hands. An IDE locks me down and cumbers me, giving me little in return other than a graphical debugger and quick syntax help. Once you have mastered the command line, it becomes painfully obvious what the IDE cannot do. An IDE is a static cockpit with lots of cool doodads and buttons. I can make my own doodads and buttons and they will do exactly what I wish and they will do it exactly how I wish.<p>I am a language maven.",1228537167

On top of it all, the combination of a nominal capital gains tax and inflation means you lose ((inflation * .15) * your net worth) every year in this manner, at least if you are a US citizen.

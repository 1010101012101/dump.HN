In Technical Experience & Side Projects section I have most of my doubts.<p>I don&#x27;t have experience working on a open source project, I&#x27;m right now at the beginning of the two listed projects, but I don&#x27;t have enough milestones to publish them. I don&#x27;t know if I should even list them. I could talk about them, but implementation wise...it&#x27;s almost nothing done.<p>The most experience I have is in Java, having some mock projects that I finished(Polynomials calculator, Bank application with a DB, Point of sale simulation, Product management app, Bank application w/o db - just to learn how to properly use Design by Contracts - mostly university assignments but with the extra mile.), some experience in C, mostly for school(various sorting algorithms, some cli book management app to learn how to implement single/double linked lists), some Python(mostly to learn the language, some scripts and now learning some Twisted, which I need for one of the side project) and the rest are assignments for school, some of which I find them very insteresting(Haskell, Lisp) but didn&#x27;t yet managed to study them more closely.<p>Having read your comments on this submission https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7854029, I thought I could use your honest (especially, cruel truth) opinion and advise for improving my CV. The more honest, concise and true (even if it&#x27;s cruel), the better.

Essentially kids are getting stiffed, and then employers are getting sub-par employees. If kids are going to college to get a better job, then these decisions on the part of schools are hurting them.<p>That said, if the economy really is all &quot;bullshit jobs&quot; (a sentiment that has floated around here recently) then the college admins know it won&#x27;t matter how badly they educate the kids, and they&#x27;ll never be found out.

I only really don&#x27;t care if I have guaranteed payouts no matter what I do, and no responsibility or reason to care to take care of the land anyway.<p>> pollution<p>In the modern anarchist mindset, pollution is a violence against, depending on scope, either the local community that is negatively impacted by the polluter or the entire world in how that pollution negatively contributes to the environment.<p>In either case, any sane libertarian or anarchist joint arbiter would in the commons consider major polluters as causing property damage, and thus any company that wants to pollute would need to seek permission from the entire area around where they want to set up shop. And when remote injunctions start coming in about how their pollution is damaging the planet as a whole, the reparations would need to be either removing an equal amount of pollution that they put in or contributing in some way to projects that do, else they are being violent upon pretty much everyone in a way that any sane society would see they only operate when everyone is consenting.<p>> only states can stop it<p>More like only states can enable it - because in modern states you never own your land, and never consent to your neighbors, and never have contracts with them about mutual conduct agreements and recourse for violation you depend on the state to provide some fictitious encompassing control effect on those that perform the kinds of violence I outlined earlier. Except the state is itself inherently violent and amoral, and is easily corrupted because of the centralization, so it is much easier for the coal company to bribe the local town council than the entire town.<p>> so are markets and companies<p>And all your interactions with markets and companies are voluntary. If they are not, you aren&#x27;t really operating in a free market. If they are not inflicting violence upon you or others, you really have nothing to complain about, really. And if they are, it is your duty and the duty of your peers to cease dealings with the violent aggressor and either economically deprive them of resources until they recant or defend yourselves appropriately as a last resort.<p>> corruption in states than there is in markets<p>The problem is that corruption is inefficient. In the absence of states, nothing restricts you from directly competing with anyone over anything, so if they are acting in a corrupt way, then there would be avenues for capitalization by competitors to exploit it. It is the same reason why in the short term it makes no fiscal sense for a business to try to raise a private militia to take over the town - the militia is an immediate huge competitive disadvantage, and you would cripple your growth potential to whoever you could subjugate because no sane external market would interact with you, and would likely do anything they can to boycott you into failure.<p>> What the market wants<p>Modern mainstream media is anything but a competitive market. The major networks would always take advantage of their IP and state resources to crush any upstarts who tried to provide real journalism and news anymore. And they would certainly get the full support of the US government in doing so.<p>In a real information market, people would seek what they are actually interested in. A lot of anarchist arguments about the collective psyche of most modern western democracies relates the whole distraction circus back to the implicit discontinuity in the brain about the organization of society in the first place and the amorality of it all. It also probably has a lot to do with how most people were abused as children - your brain will develop differently and you will always seek escapism. Confronting the reality of your circumstance is hard, and it requires enlightened rational individuals to do so. That is mainly why, while I morally agree completely with anarchist mindsets, I don&#x27;t really advocate it in the modern world. It really wouldn&#x27;t work with the current crop of humanity - it would require enough transitional generations to get to the point where we stop predominantly abusing our children, either through neglect or violence.",1403332557

First, it feels like the majority of American college students graduate from college after spending four years on material that makes them no more appealing to employers.  Second, there seems to be a thick layer of insulation between market signals and students, so that students can&#x27;t even figure out what they should be learning, even if they were motivated to do so.<p>Third, colleges seem to teach whatever garbage they feel like, slap a &quot;major&quot; label on it, and charge a ridiculous amount for it.

This is a big problem underlying the salary issue that is hardly ever discussed.  Moving outwards, many college programs are zero value add too ... outside the stamp of a degree which they confer.  Which if you think about it, you could get cheaper abroad.<p>Only a matter of time before India or some Baltic state makes cheap degrees available to US citizenship holders at cut-rate prices.

Also right next to it was a link to the terms of service they can read.<p>2) On billing confirmation e-mails, I put a link where they can change their plan or cancel.<p>Now here are a couple particular scenarios I&#x27;ve handled<p>+ Several customers called in the second month being very surprised they got charged as they thought it was a one time fee and not a saas subscription.  In both cases, they e-mailed or called me directly.  I told them I could refund their last month&#x27;s charge and cancel their account.<p>+ I had one chargeback, but it was a generally unhappy customer.  I let that chargeback go through, and e-mailed the client apologizing and mentioning I would not challenge the chargeback.<p>---Chargebacks\nNow in the general case of chargebacks, you can defend against them (I use Braintree Payments who have been awesome in guiding me through the process), if you generally do the following<p>1) State exactly what your refund policy is in your tos.  For me, I have a &#x27;we refund your last month for any reason&#x27;.<p>2) Keep track of your billing e-mails.  If the client files a chargeback, the bank will check to see if the payment has been monthly.  If the bank sees it is a monthly bill, there is a very low chance of them winning the chargeback.<p>tldr;\nMake your tos policies as transparent as possible.",1403331544

We&#x27;ve fixed it, and the fix will be available in the next major version of VC (i.e. after 2013).<p>steady_clock and high_resolution_clock are now synonyms powered by QueryPerformanceCounter() converted to nanoseconds. QPC meets the Standard&#x27;s requirements for steadiness/monotonicity.<p>Additionally, the CRT&#x27;s clock() has been reimplemented with QPC. While this improves precision and conformance to the C Standard (as QPC is monotonic), we are aware that this is not completely conformant. Our CRT maintainer has chosen to avoid having clock() return CPU time advancing faster than 1 second per physical second, which could silently break programs depending on the previous behavior.</i><p>So it is expected that VS2014 should have the fixes.<p>On a sidenote, I&#x27;ve seen most of the code, if not all, posted by the OP already before while searching for the same functionality (eg the piece after &quot;you will write your own function:&quot; is followed by something that to me seems like a straight up copy from some FOSS project, even the comments seems to match - ok I cannot be 100% certain on this but if it&#x27;s the case it would be nice to mention the source).

You can&#x27;t quite model it right, you can&#x27;t experiment by eliminating all the variables but the ones you test and so on.<p>It&#x27;s not an exact science.<p>So people who thrive in such fields are people who can slap a convincing narrative to a set of selected events, and call it a theory.<p>Now, Christensen&#x27;s narrative about Disruptive Innovation has many true elements to it. It&#x27;s a useful tool in the box to have, as a model, when you analyze your business, your competition and the market you&#x27;re in.<p>But it becomes counterproductive when Christensen seemingly is ready to explain <i>everything</i> as the after-effect of disruption. Take his excuse about the iPhone not failing.

Plus, it&#x27;s hardly that simple. The iPhone is not disrupting just laptops, it&#x27;s obviously disrupting phones, and desktops, and even wristwatches. He, better than anyone, should know that the thing being disrupted is not a product, but a way of doing a given task, something he calls &quot;what we hire to get the job done&quot;.<p>And so... what good is a model, what good is a theory, if it&#x27;s so malleable, and so subjective, that you can explains all possible outcomes for a company by tweaking what you see as the disruptor and the disrupted? What value is a model that can&#x27;t make a proper prediction?<p>The father of Disruptive Innovation has failed to be any more accurate than a coin toss so far. We&#x27;re by now convinced Christensen can fit any happenstance to his narrative <i>after the fact</i>, but just as Lepore has noticed, he has yet to make a prediction that turns out as he expected.<p>He&#x27;s just guessing, like all of us. But he has authority, because his book is enjoying popularity, so he has that air of authority when he speaks.<p>I respect Christensen, but unfortunately he&#x27;s fallible like all of us. He wants his theory to matter, he wants his theory to be shown &quot;right&quot; in every single case, but his theory of disruptive innovation is but a small element in a very big picture. He himself acknowledges that in his response, but fails to grasp the implications of it in the economic outcomes for the players he&#x27;s analyzing.",1403330416

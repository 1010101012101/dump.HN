They still need to carry this traffic to a peering location. That's not free. They still need to support their peering agreements with staff & seriously expensive routers. Not free. They need to support the ISP's whose traffic they are carrying - arguably they ISP's have paid for this, but per GB pricing is fair. It <i>is</i> cheaper to run the content over their own network. They will run over an internal CDN, reducing transit costs to a fraction of say Netflix.<p>2) I think there is some misunderstanding. The way I read all these articles, the problem is the link from the exchange to the provider PoP, and not in the local loop.<p>Bell got the nod from the regulator 3 months ago to do capacity based charging on links from the exchange to the ISP PoP. If it follows the same model as elsewhere in the world, this is usually on a wholesale, per customer basis. If the ISP in question used a 3rd party supplier then they bypass this cost. Unfortunately it appears that Bell can say no to the ISP leasing fiber capacity from exchange to PoP, which IS abusing their monopoly position.<p>The point is they are establishing a precedent. Even if their network is not overloaded at the moment (I suspect it's getting there) it will be soon. If a web company has to pay per GB of transit from Amazon EC2, but not within the AWS network, why should charging at a communications provider be different?",1296420003

2159086,comment,2158966,2158966,0,0,unoti,,,"This is a topic very interesting to me, because over the years I've written a lot of call center and customer service software used by distributed teams.  I also worked as a developer remotely for Linden Lab for long time, which had a highly distributed workforce, using Second Life and other things as a primary interaction platform.  There are things I've observed when writing software used by distributed teams that make a huge measurable difference in productivity.<p>When working remote, it's easier to feel like it doesn't really matter if you put your nose to the grindstone, since nobody can tell.  So I found it made a dramatic difference in productivity when I implemented a simple sidebar that showed what ticket each member was working on, and how long they'd been working on it.  It was intended to be sort of like an office: in an office, when you see your team members working away, it's a little more emotionally difficult to take time off to surf your favorite website or something.<p>For customer service, video game mechanics help a lot: completing each ticket gets you closer to your goal.  Keeping quality metrics up gives you a visible indication that you're a good person.  It's not easy to implement and sell these kinds of features, but it's also not easy to keep people motivated (whether they're remote or not).<p>Scrum and frequent voice communication help a lot as well.  There are downsides to distributed teams, but there are big upsides, as well.  Distributed teams, while not perfect, have many benefits.  The key to making it work, as with so many things, is to figure out ways to make everyone care and want to do their best.  In absence of that vital culture of giving a shit, even a team that's co-located together is not going to do well.  In my experience, that culture of excellence is even more important than being in the same place.",1296419806

Their net income will still differ by quite a bit (up to 400% at least).<p>The benefit here is that someone who is considered poor, and would perhaps be forced to live in the street, and only serve to increase the crime rate, will instead recieve help.

Norway does of course, like any country,  suffer from several political problems. Spending, immigration and government control is perhaps the most fleeting issues right now. But they diminish substantially compared to the issues the US has to face the next decade. And perhaps even worse is it, that the political environment in the US seems allmost hopeless.

2159071,comment,2158877,2158877,0,0,cletus,,,"My thoughts:<p>1. IMHO learning a second language will largely be no longer necessary because English will increasingly be the lingua franca. That being said, on the fly translation will clearly continue to get better.<p>2. 150 year life expectancy? This one I don't buy. Medicine here has to be differentiated in two areas: curing and preventing the causes of ""premature"" death (eg disease) that stop us reaching a ""natural"" age when we die. That lone won't get us to 150 years. We're probably not far off that limit now. To get to 150 we need to extend the age to which humans can live, which is getting into some fairly serious genetics. I can see such technology coming about but IMHO will be the province of the wealthy for some time and will probably take longer than expected (again IMHO).<p>3. I disagree with this. Despite all the efforts to stop poverty, even in developed nations, there is a segment of the population who remain poor. It might be controversial but a certain segment (IMHO) are poor and remain poor because they make poor choices.<p>Also, the definition of ""poor"" constantly changes. Poverty in the developing world is lack of access to basic health care, food and clean drinking water. In the developed world, poverty seems to mean your iPhone is two generations old.<p>And yes I realize there is true poverty in the developed world. There are people who are homeless but the scope of ""poverty"" in such discussions extends way beyond those when we're discussing social policy.<p>4. Possible. Food production will need to change.<p>5. Agreed. I think future generations will look back on this age of manually driven cars as being somewhat barbaric, especially considering the number of people who die on the roads.<p>6. I also agree that the world's will become increasingly urbanized and you will see ""mega-cities"" as a result. There are efficiency advantages in concentrating populations in such cities.<p>7. I was just having a conversation with a colleague at work on Friday about flying cars. My position was (and is) that personal flying vehicles won't happen before driverless cars. Humans won't simply be able to reliably fly such vehicles. Also, the energy costs I believe will possibly scupper such plans so we need to find a far cheaper source of energy for this to happen, especially considering we've probably passed peak oil production.<p>8. This too is dependent on finding a new, cheaper energy source. Without that space travel will (IMHO) still be too expensive.<p>9. I think this will be partially true but human labour is extraordinarily cheap and will be incredibly hard to completely displace. It's the same reason we still have humans doing incredibly menial work even when such work could be done by robots, that are comparatively much more expensive.<p>10. Probably true.<p>Predicting the future is hard. 1900 to 2000 had a <i>massive</i> amount of change, unparalleled in human history. Think about it: we went from the birth of the automobile to handheld computers, putting a man on the Moon, the global Internet and cheap, almost ubiquitous air travel. How much of that could've been predicted?<p>What's more, how much of that is on the back of cheap non-renewable energy that is ultimately unsustainable? Not just energy, but other resources like metals. The rate at which the world population is growing and using resources is unsustainable so something has to change: whether it be new energy sources are found or the population problem corrects itself.<p>I seriously urge you to watch:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-QA2rkpBSY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-QA2rkpBSY</a><p>if you haven't already.<p>If you think of sci-fi as a predictor of the future (which it has been in many ways), we've vastly exceeded predictions in some fields (eg computers) and vastly underperformed in others (eg space travel). I heard Jerry Pournelle talking abot this with the predictions from the Mote in God's Eye. The handheld computers exist now, being smartphones, less than 40 years after the book was published. But in space travel terms, we're, if anything, <i>behind</i> what we were in the 20th century.<p>To me the predictable aspects of the future are:<p>1. Urbanization;<p>2. Ubiquity of computing and networking;<p>3. Genetic engineering.<p>Other things depend on the big question mark that is cheap and abundant energy. We may not find anything, in which case the future will be bleak. If we find something however the world will change beyond recognition.",1296419555

It has not been a good thing for those who cherish Liberty above all else. It has been a good thing for people who believe government can be a force for good (for the federal government would not have the power, without war). Before the Civil War the standing U.S. Army consisted of 3 regiments. Even in those days that was a tiny army. At its largest the Navy had about 40 significant warships, many of which would be in reserve (mothballs) at any given time. This was the design of the founding fathers, who considered a large standing military a threat to the people’s liberty and a tool of despots.<p>The Civil War changed everything. Fighting the war required a huge modern Federal Army and Navy. Men got used to the idea of serving in the standing military (instead of militia service). Occupying the southern states after the war required a larger standing army. The experience of Imperial France occupying Mexico during the Civil War made leaders rethink the old militia system (militias had not done so well fighting a professional army in the War of 1812). And with the final great push of settlers westward, the larger professional army was useful in suppressing the Indians, which had largely been conducted by state and territorial militias before the War.<p>America in the latter half of the 19th century became a culture accustomed to militarism. The federal government, growing more rapidly in the aftermath of the war for many reasons, found the bureaucratic disciplines of a military carry over well to other government services.<p>WWI required not only a rapid military build-up, but for the first time in our history the federal government directing industrial production. That was a new genie let out of the bottle. WWII more of the same within one generation; Cold War immediately following introduces continuing state of war that doesn’t much affect our lifestyle; Korea, the first major shooting war without an explicit declaration of war by Congress; Viet Nam, more of the same – and all the time ever-larger Leviathan finds new areas it can intervene in society (not passing judgment here, just saying).",1296419367

People that need solar power in Seattle will have to discover sunlight somewhere first. This is precisely my point. I get the idea when people calculate ""total system costs are the same"" the calculations go like this:<p>Current system costs:
Fuel + Transport + Transmission + Environmental destruction + 1/3rd of all cancer costs + 1/3rd of every hurricane/flood + 1/3rd of Iraq war etc...<p>Proposed system costs:
Solar plants in Arizona + Wind Generators in Nebraska + Hydro on the mississippi<p>Somehow I doubt the proposed system is considering the costs of the mines/foundaries for the solar panels, or the dead birds from the windmills, or the destroyed fisheries from the hydro.<p>Additionally, consider that you still have to transport the electricity if not the fuel, and you lose a lot more on this side of the equation. Transmission losses are significant over distance. You can put a natural gas generator anywhere and it will produce power in a very dense footprint. Specifically when compared with acres of solar panels or windmills. So even if you can <i>produce</i> power at a similar rate it matters <i>where</i> you produce it.<p>Anyone that's concerned about fossil fuel dependence and CO2 should be campaigning for more nuclear plants.

The first is the most important.  One of the professors I admired greatly would always give your idea his best effort, because he knew that the mathematics would eventually cause it to blow up if it wasn't correct.  Find first principles that you can take as iron clad, then always build off of those with honesty and humility.  There was never a reason for him to grasp at straws to fabricate a straw man.  He knew there were solid theories he could work from and test as hard as he could.  He also never had a reason to pretend something was more solid than he actually knew it to be.<p>That's all well and fine for hard sciences, I guess, but the same goes for most of the softer disciplines as well.  History is often your friend.  Find the historical precedents and examine them honestly.<p>EDIT: Another thing you can do, if you haven't already, is read this:

I looked at creating a startup in that space before my current startup.<p>Ticketmaster/LiveNation control 70% of the market (in the US and UK; to a lesser extent elsewhere), this is though a mixture of owning or having exclusive contracts with big venues and having exclusive contracts with artists.<p>Venues make almost nothing from the tickets, for a big artists the artist will take a huge cut of the ticket price (often in the 70-85% region). Venues make all of their money from selling in venue products (food, drink) and a cut from product sales (tshirts, etc.) So it's in the venues interest to get as many people in as possible, venues would love to do dynamic pricing like airlines do.<p>But they can't, they're restricted by the contracts with the artists. Those contracts are very tightly written so venues cant do auctions to make more money or sell excess tickets at discount. It's also a reason places like ticketmaster have weird pricing, they can't just change the price of the ticket to be inclusive of all their fees.<p>Ticketmaster/Livenation for some time have wanted to run a discounted ticket site but it means renegotiating tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of artist and venue contracts, it's a non-trivial task. The whole thing is a huge mess.<p>Most startups in this area have tended to concentrate on the secondary market where you have less of these problems, but even there you need a lot of money to break into the market. It's very advertising driven (ticket sites are one of the biggest users of affiliate sales) and there's a huge amount of credit card fraud in the space so you often need to post a huge bond to even get a merchant account.",1296418344

I've pondered about these questions and it's cracked on the history and formation of the Internet as a whole.I mean I agree the Internet is powerful tool because of these ease of use to access and find information.However that access isn't free,in proportion to the amount of data we access online, no one person could afford to pay except the wealthy.It's like how the airline industry eventually was to bring down cost of flight and making it more affordable.However by privitizing the airline industry did it really help the airline.Airlines still to this day lose more money then they take in on a per customer basis.I can imagine that the phone companies and ISPs lose even more.Just think about the costs to operate these vast networks across the globe.You would almost think that a company like Verizon or AT&T market value would be in the hundreds of billions right? Wrong? They're all trumped by Google a portal that at it's simplest form allows an individual to locate information on the web more efficiently.Thanks to companies like Google,Yahoo,AOL,Lycos and Netscape the business model of freemium has been exploited.The sad part is that Google has to advertise just to be able to operate there vast empire.I mean just think for a moment if the first search portal whomever created it charged you a fee to access a partcular search? Wouldn't that be outrageous? Or would it really be? Remember that ancient newspaper that we all used back in the early 90's wasn't there a charge for your local paper or even your Sunday paper?As a matter of fact my Sunday paper costed more then the weekly paper what an outrage.To think that just on Sunday they have the nerve to charge me more money.But then again look at the amount of advertisements were included in that Sunday paper.. Hmm so I get to thinking that newspapers in it's purest form are portals of information in which I paid a set daily fee to access. Bingo,so fastforward 10 years later and the Internet comes along and here's Yahoo and Google which really are like The New York Times or USA Today because there portals used to access information.So let's see if Google charged me $1.00 a day and $2.00 on Sunday to access unlimited search that would be reasonable.Guess what and because they charge me a set fee the quality of the news I receive would be better an my pages would be unendated with ads! Hmm sounds like a fair tradeoff oh and what about all that indexing they do.Those spiders and advanced algorithyms all search the web to bring you organized information? How do they get all those billions of pages from a word you search? Well let's see I can't imagine they get all that for free or do they? Well sadly to say they do becuase in the early days of website design and creation of these pages creators didn't realize the value of information.Just the same reason why newspaper needed to charge you a fee to read there papers.Website designers and developers should have focused on the focal point of there work which is there work.That the information itself is more important than the access of information.I mean afterall if I had inside information that the steelers would win the superbowl and I made bets on that information.Wouldn't you be willing to pay me for that information or to have that same viable information?
Sadly to say the early founders didnt get it! Well that's why te whole freemium model exists in the first place.Companies like Google and Yahoo and others don't place a high value on the creation of that information and since they can access it for free they to missedout on a huge opportunity to capitalize on that same very business model that could have transformed the Internet as a whole.People pay for information that's why the newspaper and magazine industries thrived in the first place.So why wouldn't you think that just because you have a new medium to access information that people wouldn't pay for that? It's quite simple and all these companies overlooked and that's why there all so dependant on advertising for revenue.",1296417748

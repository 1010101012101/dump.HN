7579879,comment,7579837,7579837,1,0,salehhamadeh,,,"This happened to me last year. I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science. Last year, I got a part-time internship at a company that makes school applications. Work was monotonous, every day was like the other day. The people I worked with never challenged me to improve my skills. All they wanted was to get the job done. I started despising the moment I open the IDE.\nWhen I moved to BrainJocks, a web development company, I loved computer science again. The team are all enthusiastic and young. The company divides my time into learning, working, and exploring new things. They gave me an account on PluralSight.com to learn whatever I like, and they encouraged me to explore new tools and propose them to the company. This new internship invigorated my love for software development.\nOf course, every person has his own circumstances. If you find that your workplace is the cause to your problem, try somewhere new, even if it pays a little lower. The benefits you can get in return may be worth much more than the money.",1397354314

I personally would not look at this situation as a technical one; this is a business relationship situation.<p>Regardless of whether there is any grain of truth, the CTO has lost confidence in you. Not just a little bit. He has asked you to leave. The rest of my advice assumes the CEO (your co-founder) has quite a bit of confidence in the CTO. If that is the case, I&#x27;m not quite sure you can come back from having the CTO asking you to leave, nor am I certain you should.<p>I think it would be advisable to talk to a lawyer to see how you can cleanly and professionally leave on your own terms. Save the emotional stuff for friends and your alone time. You will no doubt need to grieve (this was your baby). But I think it would be better for you to be proactive about leaving and professionally extract yourself from this situation. That said, make sure you know your rights and what your contracts entitled you to in such a situation.<p>Once extracted, take your hurt pride and prove them wrong.",1397354159

7579833,comment,7578976,7579581,1,0,bane,,,"> Another outdated signing technology I encountered when I lived in Taiwan was the &quot;chop&quot; (\u001C印章) which was used to sign everything from post office receipts to contracts.<p>They use something similar in Korea and I believe Japan as well. There are some differences though between signing and stamping your seal. Both systems have terrible security. For example, forgery in signature based countries is unbelievably common -- it doesn&#x27;t even have to look like the original person&#x27;s signature to &quot;work&quot; in most contexts.<p>Some interesting things about the seal system, at least in Korea but I think it&#x27;s probably true in other stamping countries, I can give my seal to somebody to stamp on my behalf and the transaction is perfectly legal. Whereas I can&#x27;t easily give somebody my signature ahead of time. We deal with this in signing countries through power of attorney paperwork and the person granted the power of attorney just uses their own signature on your behalf. It&#x27;s basically the equivalent function, and terminating the power of attorney requires getting back physical possession of your stamp or 인감.<p>It&#x27;s actually pretty common, with the large Korean diaspora, to give a trusted person in Korea your stamp so that you can maintain property or take care of other business or legal obligations remotely.<p>In court cases concerning forgery in signature countries, the victim is sworn in, shown the signed document and asked &quot;is this your signature&quot; and or &quot;did you sign this&quot; and the victim can confirm or deny it.<p>The equivalent in seal countries has been harder to prosecute and presents two kinds of &quot;forgery&quot;. Either somebody using your stamp without authorization, or using a fake copy. It&#x27;s kind of turned into a bit of a mess and after a couple thousand years, at least in Korea, they&#x27;re moving towards a digital based signature system if I recall correctly.",1397352921

7579815,comment,7574763,7574763,1,0,caleb23,,,"I would recommend using LastPass as a password manager.  Here is some advice I recently wrote up on passwords.<p>In regards to Heartbleed, the Security Check that LastPass offers will help with that in terms of notifying you of the sites that you should change your passwords on since they were vulnerable to Heartbleed, but really all sites could be vulnerable to it, so I would recommend changing all your passwords fairly frequently over the next few months.<p>As long as the password is not contained within a list of commonly used words and isn&#x27;t in the dictionary, length is the most important thing. The second most important thing I would say is using the widest variety of characters possible including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.<p>You want to generate a secure password from a password generator such as GRC&#x27;s Password Generator. I always generator my passwords to be 50+ characters but everything over 15+ characters will be fine.<p>Also, make sure you change your passwords every 3 months and don&#x27;t share your password with anyone. Lastly, store your passwords securely using a password manager such as LastPass (<a href=""https://lastpass.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lastpass.com/</a>). You should have a strong master password with LastPass and use two factor authentication. You should also use two factor authentication with all of your other accounts that offer it.<p>If a site requires a secret question, make sure the answer to that question no one else would know or make it a password or phrase that you would remember. Don&#x27;t reuse passwords on other things as well (only use the same password once).<p>Make sure when you are logging in that the site is using HTTPS (the browser addon HTTPS Everywhere can help with that) and you aren&#x27;t logging in from a public network such as from Starbucks. Even if you are logging in from a private network, I recommend using a VPN that uses encryption such as proXPN. For your home or office network that you are logging in from make sure it is using WPA2 encryption, it has a random network name, a secure password, you have changed the default credentials for the network settings to something secure, you have disabled WPS, etc.<p>That is all I can think of right now in terms of password security, but those are the main things that you should focus on in terms of secure passwords.",1397352491

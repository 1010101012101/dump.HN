5712413,comment,5711742,5712141,4,0,drharris,,,"Microsoft is so hit or miss. They're incredibly innovative in the research department, but business tools are definitely overcomplicated (Dynamics, SharePoint). I use C#.NET daily, and it is the programming tool I'm most in love with. There is no easier way to make business desktop apps, and with the new MVC and Entity Framework libraries, there aren't many easier ways to make significant web applications (i.e. beyond a to-do list or blog). Azure level of functionality makes other cloud companies look almost archaic.<p>I think where they're losing is that they've stopped communicating. With customers, with developers, even internally. They are proceeding down paths they imagined to be important. Some of them are, some of them aren't, and thus the hit-or-miss nature of their current business. I think a lot of this is Ballmer. He's trying to be a Jobs and failing miserably, when all he needs to do is allow his people to actually communicate with the community.<p>Another part of it is that they can't do anything these days without a bunch of FUD from the media and Anti-MS sheep. I actually like Windows 8 and appreciate the innovation even if there are some hiccups to take care of. .NET is great, and I hope they make it easier to move forward and migrate existing apps to whatever they do next. Will they die anytime soon? Probably not. But if they don't start communicating soon and often, they'll lose some market share for sure.",1368629915

I've initiated handshakes with people whose age and home country meant they didn't really have much experience of the Western ""firm handshake"", always the limp wrist. I don't know whether to shake it, or draw the hand to my lips as courting a princess. Which, I assume, was <i>not</i> one in your repertoire of ""intricate hiphop style handshakes"".<p>Jokes aside, more than one family member had felt it important to instruct me in the art of a good handshake as a matter of gentlemanly conduct from a young age, even long after I'd obviously ""got it"", and I distinctly recall one of my friends suddenly in his mid-20s going from a pathetic one to a really decent powergrip apparently because his boss had told him after a promotion that he ought to work on his handshake.

They purposedly tried to strangulate the distributed network, because it was not going to bow and contribute to the church tax.<p>No, Internet's fate was not granted, it could have become a TV-like network of a few content providers like AOL feeding users through the nose. Actually, it is still under attack, also from other threats, many of them having grown on its roots.<p>MicroSoft is a mammoth, she will endure a very long death, but let's have the minimal pity, and let's not make this agony longer by unduly praising their latest relative PR success.<p>End of the rant.",1368629573

So, yes, its about mental illness and drug addiction -- but also very much about rich vs. poor.<p>> This is partially a money problem, but it's largely a social problem.<p>Its a resource distribution problem; its not ""partially a money problem"" or ""largely a social problem"", its is completely both (money problems are equivalent to resource distribution problems and are a subset of social problems.)<p>> A lot of other countries deal with this better because they have stronger family support structures.<p>There may be some cases where countries do this better because of <i>family</i> support structures, but I can't think of any clear examples -- perhaps you could provide some. Most modern developed nations do it better because they have stronger <i>public</i> social support structures.<p>> Programming can help, but this isn't a programming problem.<p>This much is true. Its a <i>policy</i> (and, at a more fundamental level, <i>values</i>) problem, not a technical problem.<p>> Everyone here who's arguing about their superior European social programs are really preaching to the quire,<p>""Choir"" is probably the word you are looking for; preaching to sheets of paper isn't exactly a sensible metaphor.<p>> because most Americans on Hacker News would kill to have these social programs.<p>I don't see much evidence for that ""most Americans on Hacker news"" would be willing to give up America's bias toward largely privatized health care financing, and income tax system that's heavily favorable to capital, and policy of financing a major part of the existing social support system via <i>additional</i> taxes that fall exclusively on labor for a stronger social support systems, much less that they would be willing to ""kill"" for such systems.",1368628993

If Go used asynchronous mailboxes, its performance at most would be ever so slightly worse, it would still be much better than Erlang, and Go's performance loss would probably entirely disappear in microbenchmarks anyhow.<p>Indeed, that's one of my frustrations with Go, one of the big reasons I chose to leave it alone. The ways in which it is much less safe to use concurrently than Erlang or Haskell aren't performance related, they're related to the choice of primitives. (In particular, I can't see how to build an OTP equivalent for Go. This is a <i>big</i> problem for me, since I was looking at it to replace Erlang, but I'm not ripping out something that has demonstrated how bullet-proof it is to replace it with something more fragile like Go, when performance is not my problem.)<p>To be clear, I'm just talking about the concurrency primitives, and I do not believe that Go's concurrency primitives are better than Haskell or Erlang's, full stop. That does not mean Go is not a better language for some tasks, and I further believe Go's concurrency primitives are a step up over most current ""conventional"" languages, equally full stop. For one thing, to program in Erlang or Haskell requires programming in Erlang or Haskell, which is why I mentioned the fact that Go is still an Algol-esque language. That's a legitimate advantage. I've paid the price of learning the alternate paradigms, but I would generally recommend Go to a larger corporate deployment before I'd recommend trying to convince a couple dozen people to learn Erlang.

Maybe some people can't read, or don't feel comfortable trying to read, the signs as to what will work socially, and if they want to set rules that's fine. I don't have any problem with someone who will only shake hands, or who won't have any physical contact at all - hell, if they want to follow your rule of always asking, I'd feel awkward, but if that's what you prefer then whatever, I'm fine with that.

There are clever builds running around in China factories for device bring-up and testing too, but I haven't seen any of those leaked.<p><i>there are no valid reasons to prefer Android or even Windows to iOS</i><p>I agree.

Everybody in the Sane World has an iOS-first and sometimes iOS-only mobile app approach.<p>As for Android (which is kinda meaningless.  It's like saying ""Linux"" when you're talking about a Linksys router or the entirety of AWS), the rampant security failures, hacks, crapmalware, and the feeling of ""it requires as much attention as maintaining a laptop"" by people I know puts it right of the running.  Maybe it's perfect for somebody who needs a hobby (a lot of people enjoy riding and maintaining motorcycles on the weekend too), but I need my things to work, work well, keep working, and unobtrusively get out of my way after being used.<p>All that being said, Apple is dead.  Apple has no defense against the awesome creepiness of Google Spyware (Now) and that'll drive the future.  They can't fight forever.  Apple and Google will have to make up eventually.  The only saving grace we have is Google is such crap at marketing things, they called their personal assistant ""Now"" instead of giving it a name and personality people can relate to.

For example, the first time I meet my (female) boss (or coworker), I'll give a handshake. Once we have a working relationship, is common to cheek-kiss (twice, starting left, just touching the cheeks, and optionally kissing to the air, doing very obviously and simulating loudly the sound is very posh)<p>If the relationship is close, you can actually kiss the cheek of the other person, but that's optional. If the relationship is very close, you will hug and kiss on the cheek, but just once.<p>On males, if the relationship is close (family or close friends), you'll get the hug and kiss once, though it depends on people. A ""casual"" handshake and/or hug it's the common for friends.<p>All this complicated ritual is called ""kissing"", so I guess can be difficult to know when to do what for foreign people, but it gets typically done in a very casual way, so most people won't feel very awkward if they try to kiss and get a handshake or otherwise.<p>Curiously, only a couple of months after I came to Ireland, I met the girlfriend of a coworker, and she introduces herself with a handshake. I shake her hand, and then said: ""Oh, I'm too new here, I almost kiss you"". Just as the words escaped my mouth I got how weird that sounds (the look on her face was also funny). I didn't talk to her on the rest of the night or try to explain myself. Too embarrassing :-D

So it will always be responsive. I've always been interested in supporting as many browsers/screen-sizes as possible, and Bootstrap doesn't push that right now, although in Bootstrap 3 I suppose they will also be mobile-first.<p>I also really appreciate the mixins, which I feel not only make it possible to create more semantic classes, but also you can easily customize the base Foundation styles with exactly how you want it to look (e.g. Remove a border from a button if you don't want it). As far as I'm aware, it's not possible to do things of that nature with Bootstrap. Bootstrap offers some LESS variables, but the majority of that is for changing colors and small things of that nature.<p>If you take a look at the Foundation documents, the majority of the pages have a bottom area that describes the use of SCSS mixins. I think they probably do a better job at describing the ways you can use it than I can.<p>Also, I loved Bootstrap at first. As a developer, it helped introduce me to some design elements like things like the grid and the overall appearance of their elements. I think that's great.

I spent most of my early years on MS platforms, and for the most part I liked them.<p>I picked up a Surface RT to hack on last year, after a long absence from .NET. The state of .NET shocked me.<p>For one thing, the subset of .NET that's available on WinRT vs. ""real"" Win8 vs. WinPhone is really poorly defined. The documentation is incredibly fragmented, and it was <i>very</i> frustrating the even some relatively basic utility classes weren't available on some platforms. It was a struggle trying to cobble even a basic WinRT app together because of how much trial and error there is (""does this class exist? oh shit, no, okay... what's the equivalent class that's named slightly differently in a slightly different namespace..."")<p>There's also a tremendous lack of open source. I develop iOS apps for a living nowadays, and open source is a huge part of that community. .NET has a <i>huge</i> lack of it - everything substantial is proprietary and commercial. Where I can Google for a bit and slap together some libs in an hour on iOS, on .NET it's downloading the trial libs of some commercial libraries, trying them out, adding the totals, and realizing that the same feature set will cost you $10K a year for these licenses. The alternative on Android/iOS is <i>free</i>.<p>A more general complaint is MS's schizophrenic support of .NET. When .NET 1.0 first came about it was touted as Microsoft's long-term direction. <i>This</i> was the new platform, and we can count on it being supported as a first-class citizen on all MS platforms for a long-long time. That didn't pan out exactly. Microsoft has a <i>really</i> bad habit of making 90-degree turns every so often that destroys any developer trust. You can't rely on anything on a MS platform because in 3 month's time they could pull the rug out from under you with little to no warning.",1368626843

A contemporary example of an ""honor"" granted to only a few Americans is the privilege of being a judge: Lawyers can be judges and exercise the attendant privileges and powers; non-lawyers cannot.<p>By prohibiting ""honors"", the missing Amendment prohibits any advantage or privilege that would grant some citizens an unequal opportunity to achieve or exercise political power. Therefore, the second meaning (intent) of the 13th Amendment was to ensure political equality among all American citizens, by prohibiting anyone, even government officials, from claiming or exercising a special privilege or power (an ""honor"") over other citizens.<p>If this interpretation is correct, ""honor"" would be the key concept in the 13th Amendment. Why? Because, while ""titles of nobility"" may no longer apply in today's political system, the concept of ""honor"" remains relevant.<p>For example, anyone who had a specific ""immunity"" from lawsuits which were not afforded to all citizens, would be enjoying a separate privilege, an ""honor"", and would therefore forfeit his right to vote or hold public office. Think of the ""immunities"" from lawsuits that our judges, lawyers, politicians, and bureaucrats currently enjoy.<p>As another example, think of all the ""special interest"" legislation our government passes: ""special interests"" are simply euphemisms for ""special privileges"" (honors).</i>",1368626679

It plays well with Office, Access, Sharepoint, Active Directory, IIS etc. and it's the best around at what it's doing.
You can also do webdev or solve highly concurrent problems with .NET and it's great at that as well (I'm very fond of the Nancy framework and C#'s async/await are a godsend) but it's not inherently better at these than any other language.
So no, .NET isn't dying nor do I feel it has lost momentum. It's not really doing anything crazy or new (ahem go ahem) but it's still as good as ever in what it was meant to do - general purpose programming language for Windows.",1368626508

I remember John Carmack saying something about how driver overhead was the one of the biggest bottlenecks when developing modern games.<p>Driver quality is of course something which will always significantly rock the boat when it comes to stability but that is going to be the same with any operating system. To an extent driver quality should be a factor when choosing hardware. If you don't build your kernel with Hello Kitty support you never have to worry about that code.<p>I guess that is one of the reasons that Apple has a better reputation for software reliability in that for the most part they get to choose the hardware that will be used with the OS.",1368626428

7494799,comment,7494682,7494682,28,0,Arjuna,,,"Carmack had this to say earlier, in a 3-part Tweet:<p><i>&quot;Everyone has had some time to digest the FB deal now. I think it is going to be positive, but clearly many disagree. Much of the ranting has been emotional or tribal, but I am interested in reading coherent viewpoints about objective outcomes. What are the hazards? What should be done to guard against them? What are the tests for failure? Blog and I&#x27;ll read.&quot;</i><p>Also, this:<p><i>&quot;I would expect Facebook to not exert any overt control over Oculus unless Oculus fumbles badly a few times, at which point they SHOULD.&quot;</i><p>~~~~<p>My personal take: At the end of the day, it takes more than vision and hard work to drive a dream into existence... it takes <i>investment</i>. It takes <i>capital</i>. This is what the deal brings to the table.<p>Not only that, as you probably know by now, Michael Abrash has joined the team. I mean, read Michael&#x27;s blog and note all of the technical challenges and issues with implementing VR. Read Carmack&#x27;s technical writings on latency issues. There are a lot of problems to solve, on top of building and delivering a solid, commercial-quality hardware and software experience. For example, there is tracking head position and orientation, rendering without shearing and judder, latency issues, etc... everything must be perfect in order to deliver the perfect experience.<p>Facebook brings the needed investment, plus the scaling infrastructure experience to the table. John has said, <i>&quot;I have a deep respect for the technical scale that FB operates at. The cyberspace we want for VR will be at this scale.&quot;</i><p>I have a lot of confidence in Oculus VR and their extremely capable team. These good people are experienced and they know the technical and business challenges that are ahead. This is why the acquisition occurred.<p>The passion is still there. I mean, watch this video again [1]. John hasn&#x27;t changed. After the acquisition, he said, <i>&quot;For the record, I am coding right now, just like I was last week. I expect the FB deal will avoid several embarrassing scaling crisis for VR.&quot;</i><p>And with Michael coming on board, it&#x27;s a veritable VR Dream Team with the already talent-heavy team of Palmer Luckey, Tom Forsyth [2], Atman Binstock [3], et al.<p>As Michael said, <i>&quot;That worry is now gone. Facebook&#x27;s acquisition of Oculus means that VR is going to happen in all its glory.&quot;</i><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYa8kirsUfg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYa8kirsUfg</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/category/tom-forsyth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/category/tom-forsyth</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/welcome-atman-binstock-chief-architect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/welcome-atman-binstock-chief-ar...</a>",1396144586

I&#x27;m not saying the sem web concept is useless but that poor quality and unnecessarily high costs make it a worse deal. More practical focus on specs and solid software engineering would avoid making that trade-off worse unnecessarily.<p>2. Many topics which are of interest to academics either aren&#x27;t generally useful and too many academics are dismissive of mundane concerns like software engineering. My first point falls solidly into that latter case. The former case isn&#x27;t proven – it&#x27;s entirely possible that we&#x27;ll eventually see something interesting develop with more time, although as another commenter pointed out, it&#x27;s likely that we&#x27;ll see something different which uses the good parts but doesn&#x27;t give up as much for theoretical purity. Of course, it&#x27;s also possible that they&#x27;ll spend more time having academic debates over HTTP range-14 and what will actually be adopted will come from outside the current semweb community entirely – after all, the “Web” in SemanticWeb refers to a technology which saw rapid growth due to ease of adoption, even though the academic hypertext community wasn&#x27;t impressed because it was too simple.<p>In every case, more attention to building useful tools would massively increase the number of people working with semweb technology and lower the cost for everyone doing research. Everyone who wants that class of technologies to succeed should be focused on lowering that barrier to entry.",1396144100

For most of HN&#x27;s existence, PG ran it at the same time as he was building YC <i>plus</i> having two kids. That made for an awful lot of dropped packets. One might argue that he should have handed HN off sooner, and one would in my opinion be completely wrong about that. So without HN&#x27;s &quot;secrecy&quot; there would have been no HN.<p>Second, it&#x27;s been true for a long time that you can get answers by emailing info@yc.

I am a true believer in market economies, and the magic of trade being a positive sum game is most obvious with repeated transactions at a consumer level. Company acquisitions, while still (usually) being a trade between willing parties that in theory leaves both better off, have much more of an element of speculation rather than objective assessment of value, and it definitely feels different.<p>There is a case to be made for being like Valve, and trying to build a new VR ecosystem like Steam from the ground up. This is probably what most of the passionate fans wanted to see. The difference is that, for years, the industry though Valve was nuts, and they had the field to themselves. Valve deserves all their success for having the vision and perseverance to see it through to the current state.<p>VR won&#x27;t be like that. The experience is too obviously powerful, and it makes converts on contact. The fairly rapid involvement of the Titans is inevitable, and the real questions were how deeply to partner, and with who.<p>Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting Facebook (or this soon). I have zero personal background with them, and I could think of other companies that would have more obvious synergies. However, I do have reasons to believe that they get the Big Picture as I see it, and will be a powerful force towards making it happen.

I do not believe you are correct. I find no evidence for that in the primary literature, and what I&#x27;ve found basically says that any structural differences, if it does exist, must be small. Your responses also suggest that you haven&#x27;t read the primary literature, nor understand the difficulties in interpreting the primary literature. (Which is entirely reasonable - it&#x27;s not an easy skill to learn.)<p>As I pointed out in my earlier response, science journalism does a poor job of communicating science. Even the primary journals are subject to publication bias and other factors, which has lead to articles like &quot;Why Most Published Research Findings Are False&quot; <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/</a> . If your information comes primarily filtered through science journalism and an occasional primary reference, then you may have an overly skewed view of the research results.<p>Based in what you&#x27;ve just written, you confirm by implication that there aren&#x27;t large brain differences. If there were large differences, then ADHD would have a well characterized physical diagnosis. As you point out, it doesn&#x27;t. It depends on psychological tests. You mention those tests take &quot;multiple days and cost thousands of dollars to administer.&quot; But NMR or MRI scans do not take that much time nor cost that much, and would pick out &quot;large structural brain differences&quot;, which tells me that there are no large structural brain differences that can be used as a diagnostic test for ADHD.<p>Then you mention &#x27;the entire &quot;ADHD isn&#x27;t real&quot; crowd&#x27;. I empathize with your frustrations, but that is a different topic. I am not a member of that crowd, nor was the primary reference which started this HN discussion saying that ADHD isn&#x27;t real. Its argument is that ADHD is very likely overdiagnosed:<p>> Only one significant study has ever been done to try to determine how many kids have been misdiagnosed with ADHD, and it was done more than twenty years ago. It was led by Peter Jensen, now the vice-chair for psychiatry and psychology research at the Mayo Clinic, but at the time a researcher for the National Institute of Mental Health. After a study of 1,285 children, Jensen estimated that even way back then—...—between 20 and 25 percent were misdiagnosed. They had been told they had the disorder when in fact they did not.<p>It agrees with your statement that there are &quot;variety of diagnostic criteria&quot;, and emphatically agrees with your earlier statement that &quot;a 30 minute patient interview should not be the sole determining factor.&quot; It&#x27;s horrible if someone isn&#x27;t diagnosed as ADHD who would do better under ADHD treatment. It point is that it&#x27;s <i>also</i> horrible if someone is misdiagnosed as ADHD and gets ADHD treatment even if it that treatment doesn&#x27;t help, likely makes things worse by not getting the right treatment.<p>BTW, I looked for information about your [0]. See <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3028268/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3028268/</a> , &quot;Bipolar and ADHD Comorbidity: Both Artifact and Outgrowth of Shared Mechanisms&quot; (2010).<p>> Published rates of comorbidity between pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been higher than would be expected if they were independent conditions, but also dramatically different across different studies. This review examines processes that could artificially create the appearance of comorbidity or substantially bias estimates of the ADHD-BPD comorbidity rate ...<p>(The point is that if there are dramatically different results, then that may be because of artificial biases, rather than real ones.)<p>See also <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3201827/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3201827/</a> , &quot;Pediatric bipolar spectrum disorder and ADHD: comparison and comorbidity in the LAMS clinical sample&quot; (2012)<p>> &quot;Of 707 children, 538 had ADHD, 162 had BPSD, 117 had both ADHD and BPSD, and 124 had neither. Comorbidity (16.5%) was <i>slightly less than expected by chance</i> (17.5%). ... The high rate of BPSD in ADHD reported by some authors <i>may be better explained as a high rate of both disorders in child outpatient settings</i> rather than ADHD being a risk factor for BPSD.&quot; (italics are mine)<p>The limited search I did of the primary literature does not seem to give the same conclusion as what you have stated.

Defrauding people or organizations of money or valuables is the usual purpose of fraud, but it sometimes instead involves obtaining benefits without actually depriving anyone of money or valuables, such as obtaining a drivers license by way of false statements made in an application for the same.[2]<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud</a>",1396141516

The beauty of civil litigation is there&#x27;s an easily accessible paper trail. It would be interesting to see whether or not GM has a habit of changing designs without changing part numbers.<p>However, frequently designs get changed by &quot;marketing&quot; without a part number change, even in situations without possible liability. E.g. wireless routers are sometimes totally revised while retaining the same part number. Apple also likes to implement stealth changes.<p>Most engineers understand &quot;commonsense&quot;, most marketing pukes don&#x27;t.",1396141460

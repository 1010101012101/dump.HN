Well, I&#x27;m not completely sure. For some who I am particularly close to, I text or IM them on occasion.

Syria sits right in between the oilfields in the Middle East and the oil consumers in Europe, so when a pipeline is built connecting the two, Syria has a vote for or against its completion. Since oil pipelines are both necessary and quite profitable, this can lead to very large disputes. Al Jazeera covered this last year here [1] where it was suggested that the West would be inclined to usurp Assad for someone more favorable to the West&#x27;s long term energy interests.

The downside of reduced usability is always worse than any potential gain in slowing down piracy on the period between some new DRM scheme is introduced until it&#x27;s broken. Usually that period is small, and ever since that DRM becomes obsolete, while usability stays crippled for legitimate users. All those involved in production and distribution should always keep in mind that DRM means their voluntary reduction of quality for practically absent gain of shortly slowed down piracy.

Putting a shiny wrapper on an old idea in an obvious but slightly different context is something upon which many software hackers would normally cast a jaundiced eye.<p>My point was largely that e.g. MapReduce had literally been used in the HPC world for quite some time in countless variations. Something similar occurred with Spanner where it was a minor variant implementation on a concept that existed in many systems decades old. I worked on systems that used both of these &quot;inventions&quot; in the 1990s; no one thought it was novel then either. When I think of &quot;invention&quot; in computer science, I assume some hard problem in computer science was solved. That is not the case for most of what Google is credited with in the realm of computer science.<p>The absence of meaningful novelty in Google&#x27;s systems strikes me as a good basis for being skeptical of claims of invention.  Relative obscurity of computer science does not confer invention claims on the first to popularize it.<p>People frequently attribute more computer science invention to me than is warranted (I do a lot of high-end algorithm work). I always try to make it clear that much of what they see as &quot;invention&quot; is their first exposure to obscure computer science that I happen to be familiar with and know how to exploit.

to have assembled a database that contained both the office and residential
telephone numbers of U.S. diplomats and agents based in Colombia, along with
the entire call log for the phone company in Cali, which was leaked by
employees of the utility.<p>A $1.5 million IBM AS400 mainframe was loaded with custom-written data-mining
software. It cross-referenced the Cali phone exchange&#x27;s traffic with the
phone numbers of American personnel and Colombian intelligence and law
enforcement officials. The computer was essentially conducting a perpetual
internal mole-hunt of the cartel&#x27;s organizational chart.  Santacruz could
see if any of his lieutenants were spilling the beans.<p>They were. A top Colombian narcotics security adviser says the system

We have generations who were trained to &quot;do your job&quot; -  e.g. the boss will tell you what to do and how to do it.  You follow those steps, and you make money for the company, and the company pays you.<p>Most job growth that I&#x27;ve seen has been in jobs where the boss kinda waves in the direction she wants and you do something reasonable.

Savings will likely be passed on to customers, they won&#x27;t have to tip, and so ultimately a large subset of consumers will eventually accept it. Except of course, a very small minority that is interested specifically in the human interaction... so, much like the lady in the article, the server job will not completely disappear, but it will be heavily minimized. And like there are tools with which customers can buy tickets by automation, customers will be able to order on things like E la carte ( <a href=""http://elacarte.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elacarte.com/</a> YC-funded by the way).

We are trying to make science faster and more open. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to make publishing a button, and the distribution of scientific ideas instant.<p>- Better peer review. Currently two people peer review a paper, which is too small a sample size. With 50,000 people worldwide in a research community like Machine Learning, or breast cancer, what 2 people think is not statistically significant. We need a broader-based peer review process, one that surfaces the opinions from the entire scientific community.<p>- Data-sets. Scientists don&#x27;t share their data-sets right now. The data remains stuck on their hard-drives. The main reason for this is a lack of incentives for the scientists to share their data. We need to introduce the right reputation mechanisms in science to facilitate the sharing of data. -<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the worlds scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the worlds scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.<p>We&#x27;re a 12-person engineering-driven team based in downtown San Francisco.

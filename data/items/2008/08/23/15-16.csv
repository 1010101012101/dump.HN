284663,comment,284503,284503,0,0,olavk,,,"An interesting part is the addendum in the postscript, where he wonders why ""almost everyone who has read this has completely missed the point"".<p>Of course he blames the misunderstanding on the readers (who else?), but it interesting example for anyone concerned with presentations or communication in general to ponder why this happens in this specific presentation.",1219505785
284662,comment,284654,284654,0,0,iamdave,,,"One of the most important things I think more and more ""marketing gurus"" are starting to miss is the simple fact that creating something, calling it viral, then slapping it on the web doesn't actually make it viral.<p>The minute you take control and steer something to work a certain way, and to produce certain numbers it's not a viral campaign.  It's just another campaign, and I wished people would stop trying to force their way into social marketing.",1219505767

284657,story,,,4,15,lbrandy,"Ask HN: Why does no one use google docs for presentations?",,"Large meetings with lots of presentations get done two ways (in my experience):<p>You email your slides ahead of time (or bring them on a USB stick) and share a computer and pray to god that it works.<p>Or everyone brings a laptop and has to bring their DVI/VGA convertor (just in case) and pray that the resolution thing works right when you plug it in, etc, etc.<p>It occurred to me that the web should have solved this problem a long time ago. A browser gives us a trivial way to both upload our slides to a place and to preview them exactly as they will be seen on site. It cuts out so much of the praying.<p>Then I realized, google docs already has this. It even lets you upload ppt files for conversion. And no one uses it? Am I crazy to think that such a service would be a good idea? Or is something wrong with google docs?",1219505293

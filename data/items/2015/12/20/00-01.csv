I feel like I am already in too deep to turn back.<p>Why is it an either-or thing?  If you get full time work, do one class a semester, either a weekend class, or a class that meets at night (one or two days a week).  If you&#x27;re not working and have the opportunity etc., take more classes on.  Working full time doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t take one night/weekend class a semester.  Lots of people do that - I did.  Also, you tend to learn that subject pretty well, and get a good grade in it.<p>> For jobs like web and mobile dev, it makes less sense to go for a full CS degree, since in those fields you can showcase your work and get hired a lot easier.<p>That makes sense if your life goal consists in that first hire at that first job.  I am mostly doing mobile dev right now and lean on my CS degree all the time.  I recently needed to figure out how to transform a binary injective function into a proper output, and then derive the variables from the output.  I first thought of GÃ¶del numbers, but knew from my computational complexity classes and processor register classes how those could get big quickly, so then I settled on a function where the output of (1, X) would always be a triangular number.  Without a CS curriculum, I would have never thought of this.  It also allowed for my app to exceed the capabilities of even Google&#x27;s app that dealt with this feature.<p>A case from a year or so ago - I had to deal with a race condition in someone else&#x27;s code.  My knowledge of mutual exclusion, critical sections and so forth from school helped me fix the problem.  In this case it was critical, as it was a bug in revenue-generating production code.<p>Right now, I am working with some excellent programmers on a project.  My architecture and code looks like junk compared to theirs, and they fix code I wrote with major improvements and simplifications.  At least I&#x27;m at the level I am now, with a CS foundation and some experience.  I feel sheepish enough about the quality of my work next to theirs, I am thankful that I&#x27;m not lacking the foundation of an entire CS curriculum.",1450572477

But it seems to me that there is a simple mechanism that would limit the other, more-common cases of trolling neighborhoods for left packages.<p>What if <i>everybody</i> left a <i>dummy</i> package outside their door?  For example, a simple box with a bogus label and weighty contents would do the trick; ideally, a box with retail branding (such as Amazon or others with recognizable logo).  (I am <i>not</i> suggesting anything toxic or dangerous, just worthless stuff that provides an appropriate look and feel.)<p>Am I missing something?  If such a simple countermeasure was widely practiced, the sheer risk ratio could at least provide a low-cost deterrent.<p>Obviously, the better solution would be bait packages with tracking devices that would alert law enforcement when moved and serve as probable cause for searches... but in my area, at least, property crime generally gets no attention from law enforcement.",1450571974

The submission requirements ask that you do not reference yourself directly in your work so that the reviewers can&#x27;t infer anything.<p>On the other hand it&#x27;s often obvious who a submission is from if you know the people in the field, so that goes out of the window.

I am researching the historical development of graph canonicalization for chemical information. I have bits and pieces from published papers, but did those people work together or independently?<p>The papers include institutions, so I know two of the people (Gluck and Morgan) worked together at DuPont before Morgan went to the Chemical Abstract Service. The latter then cites a presentation Mooers gave at an American Mathematical Society meeting in 1958.<p>But what was the relationship or key insight from Mooers?<p>A key detail came from an autobiographical essay from 2001 at <a href=""http://www.asis.org/History/12-lynch.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asis.org/History/12-lynch.pdf</a> , which contains the following:<p>> I was party to a conversation in which Harry Morgan [CAS] and Calvin Mooers discussed the issue of a canonical connection table. Mooers, in the light of the counter-example raised against the work of Dave Gluck, suggested a permutational approach to the design of an algorithm, which would overcome the objections. Harry Morgan (1965) then devised the method that bears his name and that has been a keystone in chemoinformatics since that time.<p>That reveals a closer connection than seen in the papers. But what was this counter-example?<p>I then read <a href=""http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=AD0460819"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=ht...</a> which says:<p>> The presentation of counterexamples, such as the arbitrarily numbered planar graph in Figure 5 devised by Dr. Lehman of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, have necessitated revisions to canonical ordering techniques such as those used by DuPont and the Chemical Abstracts Service.<p>And there is it - the counter-example. But notice the use of institutional names, not published papers?<p>How is a search engine supposed to make those connections?<p>I can totally understand the argument that people should be referring to unique names, instead of a choice of names, to make this sort of thing easier for mechanized search. But that&#x27;s not how people work. Why are they using institutional names? Because those components, like canonicalization, are part of a much larger system, which is more coupled to the institution than a single person.<p>Hence why there&#x27;s this marvelous publication (for a historian) which is a survey of the chemical information systems in the US in the early 1960s. <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=B0ArAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA172&ots=TP5X6xlSJM&dq=survey%20of%20chemical%20notation%20systems&hl=de&pg=PR1#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=B0ArAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA172&ots...</a> .

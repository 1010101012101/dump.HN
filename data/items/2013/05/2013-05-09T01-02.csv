5678337,comment,5677126,5678049,1,0,MichaelApproved,,,"But OP isn't referring to insider trading. The comment was in regards to the timing of the information. The only time that I believe executives are restricted is during/after an IPO.<p>Another issue is making sure that material information is disclosed properly. Elon was essentially hinting that they were going to have a really good quarter. That kind of information is material and would likely need to be disclosed properly to all investors at once. However, I believe disclosing that information has nothing to do with the timing of earnings release. A company can disclose any information it would like at anytime, so long as it does so properly.<p>If I'm wrong, please let me know in reply.

This meant that a regular video page, at over a megabyte, was taking more than TWENTY MINUTES to load!</i><p>> <i>This was the penalty incurred before the video stream even had a chance to show the first frame. Correspondingly, entire populations of people simply could not use YouTube because it took too long to see anything.</i><p>Link: <a href=""http://blog.chriszacharias.com/page-weight-matters"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.chriszacharias.com/page-weight-matters</a>",1368064664

While anecdotally some parents may choose to take their children to one hospital or another, I doubt this is a statistical norm.  I imagine most people choose the nearest emergency room for most emergencies, and hold off for an appointment with a doctor otherwise.  Sometimes, it's just a baby with colic.  But sometimes (increasingly in a country with a serious obesity problem) it's a heart attack, and no one is going to drive their dad 45 minutes to the cheap hospital when the one that will save his life is 10 minutes away.  Because of this I don't think hospitals have any incentive to drive down ER costs.<p>But maybe I'm projecting, since my experience with ERs tends to be ""Oh shit... get me to a hospital now Google Maps"" rather than ""I should Yelp some reviews of hospitals, because I have time.""",1368064546

I would bet money that you clicked through a series of screens too fast and didn't realize you were inviting everyone, even though it was clearly stated. That said, it still sucks, and I sympathize. The UX should ideally make it near impossible for anyone to ever accidentally spam every person they ever e-mailed.<p>On the flip side though, their ""people you may know"" feature is the best I have ever seen.

5678311,comment,5677220,5677220,4,0,clamprecht,,,"A North American friend of mine went to Cuba a few years ago.  He had a piece of glass in his elbow that had been there for a few years.  He knew it would cost at least  $700 to have it removed in the US, so he never did it.  When he was in Cuba, he went to the hospital to have it removed.  They did it, straightforward, normal hospital.  The final bill?  $7.  That's SEVEN dollars (although he paid Cuban currency, of course).<p>This same friend was in Papua New Guinea a few years before that (he lived there).  Similar story - he was cutting wood and hit his toe with an axe.  It wouldn't stop bleeding after a long time, so he went in to a local hospital and got stitches.  I forgot what the exact bill was, but it was on the order of $5 (five US dollars).  Again, it was a normal hospital, not some grass hut or something.<p>I'm not sure what this all means, except that if I need some expensive medical care that I am able to plan ahead for, I plan to look at places like Thailand for reasonable health care costs.  Emergencies, of course, are different, so I may have to go to an American emergency room in that case.  And I suck it up for my yearly physical (around $150).",1368064173

It can suck if you have a painful, but not life threatening condition, but it is an attempt to give the best overall service within available resources.  The public system will treat you if you're not going to die and normally do so well, but in the worst case (that typically makes the news) it can take a long time.<p>There is always the option of having an operation done privately, and either paying for it yourself, or having insurance to pay for it.

I am working on a company that is trying to solve some of these issues; this is a complicated industry that I am still learning much about: hopefully some of what I have learned will be of interest to some of you.<p>The PPACA (Obamacare) is seeking to address this very issue by changing medical reimbursement form a fee-for-service model (e.g. $40,000 to remove a splinter and $10,000 for blood tests and $5,000 for aspirin) to a capitated payment model with additional incentives for providing good outcomes (providing good service). This means that a caregiving organization would get $N a year to care for you, as a male patient with a heart disease in your mid fifties, with N varying as demographics and conditions change.<p>This change will necessitate a sea-change in the way doctors and other caregiving organizations will treat their patients. In fact, it will result in the creation of a new type of healthcare organization (accountable care organizations, or ACOs) with the primary purpose of bringing down the costs of healthcare (and improving health outcomes).<p>This is a paradigm shift in medical practice.<p>CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) is spearheading this change; something which would be virtually impossible to do without such a large (read: government) player taking the first move. There are a million problems with CMS and the government in healthcare, but this is one of the greatest things they have ever done.",1368063520

At one clinic, she's got health insurance and that clinic provides IUDs via their hospital, which she wanted to get. At this clinic, the price billed to her insurance would be $4700.<p>At another clinic she works at, she could get the same IUD brand and procedure for $600.<p>When she asked her insurance about it, they said they would pay 100% of $4700 in-network but 60% of $600 out-of-network.

In the past three years, I've only ever had to have it inspected, tires replaced, and oil changes. Now, the Tesla doesn't have oil changes, so that one aspect is removed, but it does have annual maintenance. So, I'm looking at maybe two oil changes per year, vs. one annual servicing; a small improvement in maintenance hassle, but not amazing.<p>But anyhow, I'm not claiming that there are no convenience advantages of a Tesla; just that there are also a lot of things that are quite inconvenient, especially if you don't have a driveway or need to take long trips. Claiming that the Tesla is better in every regard but range is vast hyperbole. For some use cases, it may be more convenient; for mine, far less.<p>Beyond that, the price is a major disadvantage; at 4 times the price of a new economy car for the entry level model, and twice the price of lower-end luxury brands, it's well outside many people's price range; and you don't even save that much because you're not buying gasoline, as the combined cost of electricity plus replacement batteries winds up being pretty close to the cost of gas you would pay for the same number of miles (depending on exactly how long the batteries last, and assuming that the relative costs of gasoline vs. electricity don't diverge too much; of course you could say that gas prices are likely to go up faster than electricity, but they may go down too).",1368061737

Someone running for the legislature of another country may be required to renounce all other citizenships.<p>But given the rather rapid rise in renunciations, correlated with the increase in tax reporting and compliance policies, it's a pretty reasonable conclusion. In any case, the US policies both real (the Reed amendment) and proposed (the Ex-Patriot Act) are rather harsh on people who renounce for tax reasons, so it will be hard to carry out a study where you ask people if that's the basis for their decision. (You'll see that Mauch carefully did not say that she left because of taxation reasons.)<p>""Expatriation is just migration on a larger scale.""<p>Your example, with two US states, isn't the same comparison. Better would be to think of a California resident who moves to Nevada, never goes back to California, but still has to pay California taxes.<p>""is it worth wasting energy on the few people a year who will do so""<p>No. Absolutely not. But there's a few other issues at play.

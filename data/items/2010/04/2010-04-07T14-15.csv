Like you find out that a fundamental part of how your product works causes data to be miscalculated in a certain scenario, and rewriting it while maintaining backward compatibility is a multi-week task? During which you will get more high-priority bugs...<p>This article sounds like a fantastic sentiment, but even a small project of a few hundred thousand lines will completely fall over as soon as it's released into the wild.  And if you had a medium-sized project you wouldn't even make it past the point where internal testing is doing large scenario evaluation.<p>That said, if it works for your team, go for it. Never throw in more process than you need, but don't assume that what works for small teams scales. Unless you're trying to sell a book or consulting services, of course :-)",1270652279

Apparently I've been following an out-of-date Clojure tutorial.<p>I just got Halloway's book, and I have to say, getting started with Clojure isn't as seamless as it could be. I mainly want to write web-apps with it, so I thought I'd get going writing an app using compojure. Well, it turns out that I to do that I need:<p>1. Java
2. Clojure
3. Clojure-contrib
4. Ant
5. Maven
6. Leiningen<p>And there's no equivalent of CPAN or gem to fetch all this for me, IMHO, a huge pain in the ass, doubly so because a lot of this stuff involved mucking around with env vars like JAVA_HOME and CLASS_PATH. Is there an easier way to set this up than just downloading the individual packages? Something like WAMP for Clojure? I'm not looking forward to going through this again.<p>By comparison, in ruby I could just:
1. Download the ruby installer (Windows)/ apt-get install ruby-full (Ubuntu Linux) 2. gem install sinatra<p>And you're done.",1270652246

You decide which folders/file-pattern go to the cloud i.e. Dropbox and which go to your external HD.  I have almost 300GB of videos and pictures of the kids that I don't want backed up to the cloud (too expensive and too time consuming).  However I also have ~500MB of text files, word docs, tax forms (pdf's printed from Turbotax online) that would be perfect to backup to the cloud since that wouldn't take any time at all.<p>Then this software would automate this so that anytime I add new pictures/videos, it would automatically go to the external HD.  Anytime I create/update a word doc it automatically gets uploaded/synced to Dropbox.  Perhaps the backup software could watch certain folders and automate the backups for me so I don't even have to think about it.

This won't take you more than half a year.<p>I'm sure you're being sincere with this advice, but I think there's a major pitfall to be considered with joining a gym. If you're joining a gym to make yourself more attractive so you can meet people, you are already on the road to hell.<p>What is the difference between big muscles and a hair implant?<p>I see happy couples who are short, who have acne, who are obese. I myself have a serious receding hairline that is merging with my bald spot as we speak. Join a gym if you don't like your body for YOUR reasons, not because you think it will increase your chances. You don't need a 'nice' body to meet people.<p>On the other hand...<p>If you find a sporting activity you enjoy, do it 3-4x per week and don't worry about your body. It will morph itself into something fine. And you'll enjoy yourself, and that enjoyment is infectious. People of both sexes naturally gravitate towards people who are doing something they enjoy.<p>Co-ed activities like Tennis, Surfing, Ultimate, Rock Climbing, and so on are all amazing ways to meet people if you are sincerely enjoying yourself. Climbing gyms are redolent with sexual tension, you could cut it with a knife.<p>And after six months, just look at yourself in the mirror and tell me you don't like what you see!<p>The key is to keep looking until you find something you sincerely enjoy. You'll meet lots of other people who sincerely enjoy it to and you won't need any ""game"" or ""rules"" to meet someone wonderful.",1270651967

I'm afraid I can't help in any way since many have already given clever, inspired, positive advice.<p>Anyway. I'm 28 and I have been struggling almost forever to find something captivating. In recent years, solving useless problems helped (<a href=""http://www.caesum.com/game/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.caesum.com/game/index.php</a> in case you'd like it) but oddly enough I don't manage to play this more than one week a year. Generally speaking, I try to get interested in some things but I soon feel indifferent to it. (I guess I'm just describing a depression symptom.) Anyway this doesn't make a living.<p>I've read people around here (including PG) writing they were poor employees and it reassured for some weeks since I really am a pitiful one (to say the least). But since then I came to realize that comparing myself to this kind of people was outrageously pretentious. I may not be stupid but I can no longer do anything. I have long liked to blame school and parents for this since it was not the same in my early childhood. But blaming does not help.<p>The most awful thing I sometimes come to think is exactly what people suggested to you: it's what adulthood is like, you are through some age crisis. If that's how life is, I should have hanged long ago. (But that's not good karma. etc. -- Nicely put.)<p>I guess, like others suggested, a key point is finding something valuable to do. Anything you feel rewarding. Especially if it may have measurable success, I would say. Helping others is good provided either these people do not overlook your efforts or you are confident enough to value your efforts by yourself. Actually, do anything you can achieve now with the energy you have in store. I can testify that the more you wait the less energy you have. (But this doesn't prevent me from still waiting.)<p>The best would be to find a field in which your efforts can add up. Founding a startup may be captivating and hence a therapy. But how could people like me (I wouldn't ) show the needed strength? My last effort to be on topic shamefully fails. Anyway, I took for granted that your problem comes from your job which is far from being clear.<p>Sorry for the English (or for telling nonsense (which is almost the same in my case)).",1270651958

This in conjunction with a large number of private engineering colleges setup in the 1990's, meant engineering became an easy ticket to getting a decent paying job. And at the end of the day, money matters especially in a poor country. (Btw I'm an Indian living near Delhi, before someone thinks I'm just trying to bash the country.)<p>On the positive side, things are changing for better. Post economic liberalization in 1991, there are plenty more opportunities for young (& old) people to earn a good living. Overall, economic development coupled with information revolution are paving the way for this and the future generations to take more risks and do what they want, rather than worry about basic necessities of the life.<p>I was around 10 in 1991, and I have literally seen things/attitudes change in front of my eyes.

In the status column, if you hover over the thought bubble icon a window pops up with info on the quality score.  You can also add it as a column.  Click the ""columns"" button above the graph and add it.<p>Quality Score is a measure of the relevance of the landing page to the keyword.  Google wants everything to be relevant for the end user, so they penalize you with higher CPC if your page is not relevant.  You can help your Quality Score by making your page match your ad copy and keywords.  For example, if I sell nutritional supplements and have a page about nutritional supplements, I would get slapped with a low QS if my ad copy and keywords were about protein powder, even though they are really relevant.  Instead, you should make a landing page for protein powder (use this in the title, H1, H2, etc, and in the body), use the same keywords in the ad copy (title, body, e.g. ""Buy Protein Powder - Mega Whey Protein Powder - Build Muscle Fast"", and in the display URL, e.g. www.supplements.com/Protein-Powder), and target variations of this keyword in your ad group (e.g. buy protein powder, best protein powder, cheap protein powder, etc).<p>That way someone looking for ""buy protein powder"" sees your ad, with ""protein powder"" repeated 3-4 times, clicks, and gets to a page titled ""protein powder"", sees sections titled ""learn about protein powder"", etc., and finally sees a call to action button ""buy protein powder"".  They are more likely to convert.  You also have to experiment with exact and phrase match (I never use broad match) and negative keywords as well.  I guarantee you will see 7-10 QS right away, and CPC of £0.15 or less for position 4-10, and conversion rates of 5% to start, and many more impressions.",1270651436

MBAs get more.  Note that even students who do Mechanical & Civil engineering try to get software jobs.  That's where institutes like Aptech and NIIT come in (they're now global franchises, but they started as tiny training institutes in an Indian city).  I once met an auto-rickshaw driver who had a Bachelor's degree in science.  He started driving the rickshaw because 2 years after graduating he couldn't get a job.  If he'd done engineering, his college (or training institute) would have placed him somewhere.<p>When I graduated high school, and was in line to submit my college application, I heard a bunch of people mention that they'd applied for engineering and medicine and would take whatever they got.<p>Another reason, specific to guys is that it increases their chances of getting a bride from a ""good"" family, and also the potential dowry he could get.  Software jobs tend to take you abroad more often than other jobs, and, believe it or not, there are some communities in India that will raise dowry prices based on the number of US immigration stamps you have on your passport.  Yeah, officially dowry doesn't exist.<p>Lastly, some people study engineering simply because they're really good at it.  I've encountered hundreds of people who really had the aptitude to be engineers.<p>Disclaimer: I'm Indian but I studied Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics.

Plenty of game theory to amuse, on your way to serious reflection!<p>I wonder about the plan of 'basing morality on reality'. In a way it can't be rejected of course, but it is a formula that is very easy to misread. There was a traditional distinction between 'practical' and 'theoretical' philosophy -- the origin of the familiar opposition practice/theory, but quite different. The associated epistemologies are very different.<p>Consider, to take a trivial illustration that doesn't reach so high as the ethical: my (practical) knowledge the I am typing something to Hacker News, and your (theoretical) knowledge of the same thing, if you are watching.
Is my knowledge an effect of the 'reality' that I am typing something to Hacker News. Is it so to speak 'reality based', as yours certainly is?<p>Plenty of knowledge of reality, e.g. the layout of the keyboard, what has actually appeared on screen, etc. comes in, of course. But I am making this 'reality', I am making the thing that is cold external reality for you.
The assymetry between your knowledge and mine in this case has parallels at the higher levels. Maybe Randism is true of Martians, for example. But even so that wouldn't be how the Martians know it. They wouldn't have 'reality based' knowledge of it.

If you get a C on your final, it doesn't matter much. If you get passed over for a promotion, it's the first sign that you need to be looking for another job.<p>My experience is that the happiness range of college is 4-8, with a peak around 7, and that of adulthood is 2-9, with a peak around 4.5. The range is much wider and the peak of the curve is lower, but there's much more potential upside. In college, the star performers have as good a life as the average students. The ""real world"" has the potential to be really amazing, but for the median player, it's pretty shitty. The fact that even the most talented 25-year-olds live in fear of being in the latter category creates a lot of anxiety, and it can be overwhelming.<p>Some advice: Definitely see the therapist, assuming you can afford it, and make sure that you're taking care of basic needs (exercise, nutrition, sex).<p>You said: <i>Or if I do know exactly where I want to live, I'm always terrified that I'll regret the move later.</i><p>Remember that you can always move back. No one's expecting you to buy a house. People who leave New York come back, and people who come to New York from Chicago, Minneapolis often go back. As scary as ""starting over"" socially is, it's a smaller cost than the upside of living in the right place for you. Besides, you probably only have 3 to 6 real friends in your city at this point, and those you'll keep regardless of your move. (New York may be a special case; it's easier and cheaper to live elsewhere and visit 2 weeks each year, which a lot of people do, than to live here, because of the massively overpriced housing).",1270649709

They are very competitively priced.<p>I am vehemently against take-home-backups. You may trust your team members but they can still be robbed, get their cars/homes broken into, or just simply lose the drives. While chances of smart-criminal exploiting your data to gain competitive advantage is very low, the chances of your private information being sold to others is very high - someone can get your customer CC#s, employee SSNs etc. very easily. How often do we hear about an employee lose a laptop or HDD that contains 2 million CC#s and SSNs in an Excel or Access file? Please don't set yourself up for that.<p>With respect to backup software, my favorite way of backup on Windows is robocopy. I've been using it for 4+ years and it has worked flawlessly EVERY SINGLE time for me. I have very simple DOS scripts that mirror the entire source folder to destination\YYYY-MM folder. Since I only have about 300GB of data and 8TB of storage, I also mirror the source to destination\weekday folder. What this gives me is the ability to retrieve files from any day in last 7 days, or any past month (depending on disk space available). And destination\YYYY-MM always has last night's data.<p><pre><code>    DOS>robocopy ""\\SrcServer\SrcFolder"" ""\\DestServer\%weekday%"" /E /R:1 /W:3 /PURGE /COPYALL /FFT

    DOS>robocopy ""\\SrcServer\SrcFolder"" ""\\DestServer\%yyyy%-%mm%"" /E /R:1 /W:3 /PURGE /COPYALL /FFT
</code></pre>
If you have databases, dump the DBs once a night into one of the SrcFolders. Now you have pretty good backups of your DB too. HDD space is so cheap. I have 3 separate DestServers where I backup to. After the initial backup (and once a month), it's pretty fast each night. If you want remote backups but don't have the bandwidth to copy 20GBs a night, Open-E SANs work great for that. Of course, you can also use DeltaCopy (which is just Rsync for Windows).",1270649631

Here's a ""pickup method"" that'll have even MORE success than the awesome mystery method :<p>1) Join a gym. Workout a lot until you have big muscles. This won't take you more than half a year.<p>2) During that half a year, take up meditation and contemplate your past relationships, your parents, your childhood. Write about it in a journal and become at peace with who you are. Think about what you want.<p>3) During that time too, concentrate on your career. Get it all laid out in front of you.<p>Now, you've made yourself as attractive as possible. Next up, find random women - on craigslist, on okcupid, on the street. Talk to them. Treat them like equal human beings and never, ever deceive them. If you want sex but no commitment yet, tell them when that comes up.<p>There will be some more waiting, sure. Waiting is until fullness. After a while, you will get to the point where you are in good shape, you've got a good career, you're emotionally stable and you deal with women honestly and see things from their point of view.<p>If you do this, you'll never have trouble finding someone to sleep with. Maybe you can get someone slightly ""hotter"" and stupider by deceiving people? However, in my 8 years of living with X1 and my 2 years of living with X2 and the single-ness in between, I've noticed there are all kinds of different types of sex. Sometimes, it's just mutual masturbation. Sometimes, sex is a transcendent experience. For me, the experience is always improved with honesty and destroyed by lying. I may not necessarily believe in monogamy anymore, but I believe sex is an expression of love. Love can last a day or a week or a month and it comes so easily when we give up on lying.",1270649359

I'm really wondering if someone can get by with just having some soda or juice instead.<p>There are plenty of good reasons why some wouldn't want to drink alcohol -- religion, an alcoholic in the family, being a recovering alcoholic themselves, etc.<p>With that said, yeah, drinking with your teammates is a great way to get to know them better.  You can all rant about random little things, take absurd positions in arguments, and it's all ok!  And everyone eventually gets a turn to make a fool of themselves, so we end up accepting each other more -- shared secrets & all :-)",1270649041

1247233,comment,1246889,1246889,0,0,dedward,,,"Finally something I can comment on, as I like to cook, and I upgraded to induction about a year ago.<p>Upside: It's like cooking with gas, without the risk of fire.  It looks slick.  If you get a good and powerful model, the install footprint is small and cooking on it is very reproducable... (setting 7 on burner 3 with this pan is always the same).  You can also get maintain lower temperatures than you can with other stovetops,  negating the need in some cases for a double-boiler and making it easy to keep food warm - there are a plethora of other technical coolies too - like how as soon as I lift up the pan to dump the pasta, the power to the element shuts of. It's more efficient.  The cat can walk on it and even though he hits the buttons, he can't turn it on - elements are reactive, they won't activate if they don't sense enough ferrous material above them.<p>Downside: It's ceramic. Don't drop stuff on it. 
Downside: It's ceramic, if you like to sautee stuff by lifting up the pan and/or sliding the pan around, it will just scratch up your cooktop.<p>A professional restaurant, for this reason, would probably benefit from both gas and induction at the same time.",1270648954

1247226,story,,,11,7,leftnode,"Ask HN: Learning about Venture Capital",,"Hi HN,<p>I'm interested in pursuing a venture capital company to try to get some funding for my business idea, but I have a few questions about VC. If you have a link or some reading material that answers my questions, I'd love to read it too.<p>1. Can you ask a VC company for how much money you need, or do they offer you money based on a valuation?<p>2. How much control do they have over your business? Do they dictate salaries, compensation, bonuses, who you can hire, what tech you can use, etc? For example, say a company gets like $33 million in VC. What's to stop the CEO from making his salary $5 million a year and then just leaving after a year, regardless of the status of company. I realize most entrepreneurs wouldn't do that out of principle, but can the VC's dictate who is paid what?<p>3. Or, to counteract that, do they feed you money a month at a time or do they just cut you one big check?<p>4. What happens if you just totally fail but it was clear it was a legitimate effort? Are there any legal ramifications, or do the VC's cut their losses and each go their separate ways?<p>5. I already have an incorporated business, so I have that side covered, but the business is literally worth $0 because I haven't sold anything or have anything to sell. Say I wanted to raise $500,000 to build out the idea I have, what % of the company would the VC ask for?<p>Any other tips others have for raising capital would be extremely appreciated! Thank you!",1270648834

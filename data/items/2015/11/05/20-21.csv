It also might be better.  There are a lot of ideas that already failed, and a lot that haven&#x27;t yet been tried.<p>But none of the potentially better schemes can possibly work when you already accept taxation as axiomatic.<p>Of course, this doesn&#x27;t mean that there is no value in attempting to determine a method of taxation that is <i>least unfair</i>.  But given the variance in individual tastes, you may have to combine multiple models of fairness to come up with a reasonable basis for comparison.<p>If your tax scheme takes as much money from a person as it is possible to take without causing that person measurable harm, you&#x27;re obviously going to be able to take a lot more from rich people than from poor people.  But then, as everyone would end up with the same standard of living, you disincentivize excellence.  So maybe you use a model drawn from psychological experiments with respect to reward-seeking behavior, and you give accomplishment above and beyond the lowest common denominator diminishing returns.  Maybe someone who produces twice as much gets twice as much as their reward, but someone who produces ten times as much only gets five times as much reward.  The studies on lever-pushing rats suggest that this would still work.  Someone might even produce twenty times as much for only six times the reward.",1446757168

The political-myopia of tech culture is on full display here...<p>What is being argued here is that there should be more to an education than a vocation. The purpose of a higher education is to make one a thinking, learned human being. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re Knuth when it comes to CS, if you don&#x27;t have a working knowledge of history and philosophy and political theory, you&#x27;re uneducated.<p>Another theme I see is that people have to earn a living so they must learn ONLY STEM. That&#x27;s false for 2 reasons. The first is that one can do non-utilitarian study in philosophy, for example, while also learning CS to get a job. It is also wrong because it is a reflection of the high cost of an American education that forces people to think about &quot;return on investment&quot;. That is the very notion that is being criticized here! Education should not calculated solely in economic terms because there are social returns to it.<p>The fact of the matter is that it is absolutely disastrous - morally and culturally - to uncritically accept the views of our neoliberal system.

While there is as yet no accepted theory to explain patterns in the results, a number of conjectures have been proposed. We discuss three prominent conjectures (which are not mutually exclusive) - that variability of beta-decay rates may be due to (a) environmental influences, (b) solar neutrinos, and (c) cosmic neutrinos.

Now that mainstream libraries are offering similar tools and with reasonable trade-offs in terms of functionality offered versus level of dependency, there&#x27;s not much reason to maintain our own in the next generation of the UI.<p>In case you&#x27;re interested, our model code also presents its interface in the form of immutable data structures, with quite fine-grained events available to monitor quite specific parts. But even with that, in something like our small multiples test case, where we&#x27;re plotting a number of interactive SVG charts using modestly derived data but thousands of underlying data points, it appears that the indirections and tests do still add up to a noticeable level of overhead.

Since about 2012 it takes more time to perform the analysis than it does to generate the data. And even though all of the raw data -> BAM -> VCF or counts steps is automated, nothing after that is (or can be, since that&#x27;s where the science happens).<p>But, the $1k genome really is significant. Costs matter.<p>Researchers will only sequence what they can afford. So, when sequencing a genome was $10k, there weren&#x27;t too many 30X whole genomes sequenced. Instead we had exome sequencing of individuals or low-depth sequencing of populations.<p>Fast forward a few years, and now the costs have gone down significantly. Because of this, we are now starting to see more whole-genomes. Now, the costs of to sequence a whole-genome at 30X is about the same as targeted exome sequencing (due to the extra capture costs). If it&#x27;s almost cheaper to just sequence the whole-genome and skip any extra capture probe biases, why not just sequence the whole thing? This is particularly true when looking at complex diseases where the underlying cause(s) may not be in the coding part of a gene.<p>So, in that regard, cost really was a bottleneck. With all of the new whole-genomes available, we can start to ask even tougher questions. And with more data available from more people, we can start to get some real confidence behind our predictions.<p>But, you are right in that it does all lead back to the data-analysis bottleneck. Before we had as more data than we could deal with. Now, we can process data faster, so that&#x27;s good. But we also have significantly more data to process, so in the end, it&#x27;s about even.<p>The other issue then becomes data storage. What do you do when you have a few hundred terabytes or a petabyte of sequencing data? S3 can get pretty expensive at that scale. Instead, it&#x27;s probably just cheaper to store the DNA in a freezer, and if you ever need the data - just resequence it.<p>Edit: reworded a bit",1446754925

Chips have revisions too. All of these differences strike me as being about scale of complexity, rather than full on new phenomenon. And it&#x27;s true, for electrical engineering complexity is bounded by cost, even though there can still be <i>a lot</i> of complexity in a cheap chip (but the manufacturer is incentivized to get this exactly right, too).

One way to change that environment to encourage more rigor is to change the <i>culture</i> of the field, which IMHO can be helped by calling it &quot;Engineering&quot; and pushing it more towards so, rather than modeling the culture around eg flaky webcrapps.",1446754561

Unless you theorize there is some other force that only affects dark matter.<p>If the only force is gravity then dark matter particles can &quot;overlap&quot; without interacting, so you would have huge clouds of particles orbiting and passing through each other for eternity since they have no friction they have no ability to transform velocity into other forms of energy.<p>Since they are eternally in free fall they can detect nothing whatsoever.<p>Occasionally some ordinary mass would go by and move their orbits and they would not be able to tell since you can not feel gravity when in free fall.<p>> would they just see inexplicable gravitational point-masses with absolutely nothing there to cause them?<p>You can not see gravity directionally, so you can not see points with more, or less, gravity.

It uses metadata provided by Arxiv&#x27;s API to build a categorization model for the scientific disciplines, using each papers title to build a &quot;bag of words&quot; vectorized model and then allocates each paper to a category based on the contents in its summary abstract. Each category grows out of a &quot;parent category&quot;, sorted by a simple difference in words of the categorical labels.<p>Part of the project is to publish the visualization to gain feedback from users, so if you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know! It&#x27;s certainly not perfect by any means, but being my first data visualization and first exposure to programming with a javascript framework(d3.js), I&#x27;m quite proud of it.<p>I plan on writing up a blog post about the development of this, mostly for myself to reflect on the personal growth (and sometimes frustrating!) experience, that hopefully others find interesting or informative. For now, I need to focus on finish up the nanodegree (A/B testing next!)<p>-Cole",1446753696

We always tend to have complicated and custom GUIs (hence all the GUI framework stuff). And there&#x27;s a whole set of other commonly needed library code that we provide.<p>Re: the live-coding stuff, initially we&#x27;ve found it really useful for GUI design - isolating individual GUI classes and nudging their code around to get the behaviour right, rather than having to repeat the tedious edit->compile->run->navigate cycle. But it has a lot more potential uses that we&#x27;re just starting to explore, and hopefully as it becomes more solid, our users will think of even more things it can do.",1446753657

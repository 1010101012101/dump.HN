What I do know, is that you didn't both go to college and also choose not to go to college.<p>If you did go, then you don't know what would've happened to you if you hadn't gone. You could have lived in Costa Rica for 3 years and decided to establish a charity, never thinking twice about the value of higher education. Maybe later you would've posted in this thread, and had the top rated comment about how much you learned on that trip in comparison to what your friends learned in college.<p>However, it's also possible that you didn't go to college, and are simply regretting that choice and trying to warn those younger than you not to make the choice that you did. But what if you had gone? Maybe you would've hated it, and dropped out after two years, thinking it was a completely horrible idea.<p>Whether or not you went to college, you don't have the full picture. You don't know what it would've been like to do the opposite. That's why this is not an easy question -- that's why people actually talk about this. If it were as easy as ""I'm older than you, and I think you should go, therefore you should go,"" this thread wouldn't exist. So don't act like you have the right to tell others how to live <i>very</i> important parts of their lives. We all have to walk our own journey, and make our own decisions, and if we just listen to those more experienced than us, we will never get anywhere important. And we probably won't be very happy, either.",1358906399

5100934,comment,5098873,5099873,3,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"> Some Professors just keep shooting down their students' ideas, rather than actually teaching or guiding them.<p>This is what they are supposed to do. You can't be taught or guided on how to PhD-level research; like writing, it is more about trying and being critiqued on your outputs for N years straight. If you don't like being critiqued, don't do a PhD. If you think your ideas are good, persist with them even though your adviser is saying ""no,"" and be ready to accept when the idea really sucks and you need to switch.<p>I took 8 years to finish, no regrets at all.",1358906366
5100933,comment,5100632,5100850,2,0,lsc,,,"Meh, maybe it's because I came of age during the first bubble... but I see life as a series of opportunities that open and close;  they open and close in part based on your own attributes (e.g. you need to meet the minimum qualifications for the job, and you need to apply or otherwise make yourself available,)  but also based on time, chance, and other things you don't control.<p>I got out of high school and got my first programmer/sysadmin job in '97 or so.  (I had a few years of cable monkey and hardware/windows work in high school.)  - But that was almost entirely timing;  The minimum requirements in '97 were really low, due to the dot-com bubble;  Pure luck, really.  But then I was able to learn enough that I made the cut when the minimum requirements went way up after the crash.  (There is no way I would have made that cut right out of highschool.)<p>If I had gone to college... well, it was really, really hard to find a job in my field with no experience, four years after '97.  Maybe I would have learned enough in school to make the cut, maybe not.   Maybe I would have been able to convince an employer that I was that good without paid work experience, maybe not[1].<p>Also, if someone else is paying for school?  that's a big opportunity there, too, and it's possible that opportunity might not be there in a few years.  (Is it a bigger opportunity than a job in the field you want?  I don't know.)<p>But that's how I'd look at it.<p>[1] As a sidenote... if you are badass enough to go to school and have a job/internship in your field at the same time?  that's best of all.   Many of the best people I know did that.   It's really difficult to pull off, though.  I don't think I have what it takes to pull that off, not without stretching the school over 8+ years.",1358906362

The killer feature of the app seems to be the ability to process emails in your inbox, telling the app to send them back to the inbox at certain time intervals (later today, tomorrow, next week, etc.).[2]<p>I've been casually learning Ruby over the past several months, and was inspired by Mailbox to hack together a very rough snooze feature independent of the app.[3]  The Ruby app hooks into special Gmail labels and causes emails in those labels to 'resurface' to the Inbox if certain conditions (mostly timing, e.g. the 'Tomorrow' label resurfaces emails at 10AM the next day) are met.  It will take some time to develop the snooze workflow, but I like the system so far.  An independent snooze function also has the benefit of letting me continue to use Sparrow to manage my email on iOS.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mailboxapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mailboxapp.com</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/mailbox-app-review/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/mailbox-app-review/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://github.com/mattparmett/snoozer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/mattparmett/snoozer</a>",1358906036

Just speculation and outright wrong information.<p>I have no doubt that some of the criticism is rooted in just a general hatred and cynicism about ""kim.com"" and has no foundation, but some of the things they're doing are legitimately questionable. Like having javascript served from their servers have access to your password. If you want it to be secure against them, you can't really do that. If they get compromised then their server will serve compromised javascript and your data can be read by the attackers the next time you access it.<p>But it's a trade off -- using javascript has somewhat lower security but is easier for users to use -- and it seems like they even recognize it. The way around it is to use a community-verified open source client (like a browser plug in) to process users' passwords and never leave them or the unencrypted data in the control of code from the Mega server, and it appears they have plans to do that. And that has other benefits as well, like making it easy to use high entropy machine-generated passwords for every piece of data and having the plug in store the passwords encrypted on your local disk with a master secret, so that you only have to remember one strong password for all your data (or, if you're paranoid, one password for each set of data classified by security level).<p>>The ""If you can break SSL, you can break MEGA."" made my day.<p>Yeah, is that actually not a straw man?

For example, if you write code like:\n1) User requests transfer in the UI\n2) Query the DB to see if the transfer is legal\n3) If so, update the database.<p>you have to think about race conditions even if the database implements serializability.  First of all, you have to have enough of a clue to do steps 2 and 3 inside the same database transaction, or else the isolation level doesn't help you in the least.  Everyone who deals with an RDBMS has to worry about transaction boundaries all the time anyway to avoid race conditions, so it's not too much of a leap to assume that people who are used to worrying about transaction boundaries will have to have some idea of what kind of problems those transaction boundaries will prevent for them.  Most databases in production systems don't do full-on serializability as an isolation level (and if they do, it's too expensive to turn on), so pretty much every engineer's real-world experience is that if they do a query against table A, then an update against table B based on that data, that they can have a race condition and they need to lock A or materialize potential conflicts.<p>I guess it's possible that my personal experience or the engineers that I work with are not a representative sample, but if you're working with sensitive issues like money transfers you tend to be really, really super-paranoid about it, and there's no way that something like that is overlooked by a halfway competent team.",1358903491

The ranking (and subsequent curve fitting known formally as calibration) is done across a level-band (bascially 'job title') across a much wider scope than a single team (i.e. across a division). The idea that your co-workers are actively plotting to somehow take some reward from you come review time is a poor caricature of reality. Does it happen? Possibly, Microsoft is a huge company. Is it common? Not based on my experience and conversations with others in different parts of the company. Anecdotally I have heard 0 credible stories about it from anyone willing to put their name behind it (i.e. I have seen anonoymous posts on minimicrosoft, but more on that in the next sentence). Also minimicrosoft has a clear selection bias as people don't go their to chat about how much they love various aspects of Microsoft culture. Citing that as evidence is like citing a Tobacco company research paper on the effects of smoking, questions on impartiality have to be considered. That said, and as I pointed out in my first sentence, I have no insight into the actual going-ons in stack-ranking meetings, so for all I know it could be horse-trading and petty-politics and curve-fitting on a per-team basis. That would be immensely stupid, and I don't get the impression that accurately models reality, though what the exact granularity between team of 10 and division of a thousand is, I don't know. There are other things about the Microsoft review system to dislike before curve-fitting, but it is certainly up there, and probably the most publically known aspect.",1358903267

The microphone array looks very symmetric, and usually with radio interferometer's you set up the antennas to not be symmetric, in order to prevent ringing (ie areas on the sky where you get very good signal, and other area's where you get very poor signal. With a circular aperture, you'd get a response function resembling a Bessel function). So I wonder if they could get better results with a less symmetric microphone array.<p>Hmm...

Let me preface my complaint with the fact that HN is probably the only site I visit frequently, due to the quality of posts and commenters.<p>My biggest complaint is this: I enjoy reading the comments of submissions, oftentimes more than the submissions themselves. It's really frustrating to read a post with many comments in the morning (lets say, 40), then come back at lunch and browse the same comments when there are more (say, 45 - I often leave interesting posts open in tabs to look at later). Obviously these numbers are arbitrary - think of 10 new comments on a page with 100 or more! Without a clear indication of what is new after a page refresh, I have to re-read every comment and compare post times (or effectively recall reading that comment previously) in order to see what's new. Compounding that is that the post order can change.<p>Unfortunately, I'm not aware of anything that can be done to fix this. To me, that is a usability defect. Enough for me to stop visiting?

1783129,comment,1782714,1782791,0,0,cstross,,,"There's also a second reason British plugs are robust and fused: they're built to carry up to 3 kilowatts at 230 volts. (None of your wimpish American 110 volt mains juice here! Nothing quite makes your hair stand on end like accidentally touching a live pin carrying 230 volts and 13 amps ...)<p>To that end, the live and neutral contacts in a British socket are shuttered. The long earth pin on the plug makes contact before the live or neutral pins are in the socket, and once in contact, raises a shutter to permit live and neutral to make contact. And the nether regions of those pins are insulated so that if a plug is halfway into a socket and something bridges the pins, it can't make contact.<p>This is a great design -- for space heaters and ovens and server racks. It's a bit less useful for the low power consumption devices that have come to dominate the market (where maximum draw is well under 1Kw -- often under 0.1Kw).",1286887772

I think people are investing way too much into the prospect of an autonomous car and no one is really asking for it.<p>Google and its researchers are smart. So these concepts are exactly that concepts. But what gets put into a car is completely watered down.

A car that learns how to handle adverse conditions and can assist the driver is probably more valuable than a car that can do it alone. I believe this is where the real payoff is.  Mercedes-Benz already has S-matic in certain cars that can determine the speed of cars in the front and behind and brake accordingly.

And Linux/BSD had to be that highly optimized, or it would have failed in the server sector, probably wouldn't support as many architectures and weird hardware parts.<p>Having said that, I guess that a lot of people would be happy with the level of support and speed Plan 9 supports, as hardware tends to merge (RIP MIPS, Sparc, 68k, PA-RISC, S3, Tseng, Token Ring…), and Moore's Law takes care of the rest.",1286885957

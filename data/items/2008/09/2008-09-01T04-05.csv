I like the self-criticism and multiple theories---your writing is quite uncommonly self-reflective.<p>Kinda amazing if this was only when you were 15. This stuff is extremely hard to articulate.<p>Can I ask you .. when did you ""abandon the theory ?""<p>Also, what kind of stuff did you read before writing this paper ? What kind of stuff influenced you ? I would be curious to know how much you read about psychology, behaviorism, neuroscience etc. before writing the paper.<p>Read minsky's books. Society of Mind and Emotion Machine. These are the most comprehensive overview to AI/computational psychology. EM's got a lot of stuff about 'consciousness' and what it means to be relatively conscious. I like that you don't slip into metaphysical crap about it, but rather go into mechanistic explanation of the phenomenon.<p><a href=""http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/E4/eb4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/E4/eb4.html</a> (the server is down..check in a couple of days)<p>Here's a recent lecture by Minsky about his ideas:
<a href=""http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/484/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/484/</a><p>Minsky had the idea of low level / high level brain which he expanded to a 6 level brain (like your stuff in 'feedback to the theory' section). It was partially implemented in Lisp by his student Push Singh in 2005 in his phd thesis over at mit. I think his work would roughly map to your 'illusionary and actual machinary' idea. The illusionary machinery constantly represents the actions of the actual machinery. This is what you perhaps mean by 'sends partial information. Note that the illusionary machinery needs to be able to influence the future actions of the actual machinery. I like that you have multiple goal types.<p><a href=""http://web.media.mit.edu/~push/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.media.mit.edu/~push/</a><p>Also read the writings of Aaron Sloman over at Birmingham.",1220242336

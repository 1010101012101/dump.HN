With your name and the layout I was suspicious, but I wasn't sure. This time I read the title at the top of my browser window. <p>I'm not in the target demographic, but here are my first thoughts:<p>- I think the idea will work and sells itself.\n- I'm a little confused mystified by the navigation: are these feature stories? Columns? Other blogs? Is this an ""issue style"" publication or is it constantly published?<p>I won't comment on the content (I browsed an article) because I'm not the intended audience, and wouldn't want to add worthless information. <p>Good luck to you, you may have a bit of a winner.",1180108518

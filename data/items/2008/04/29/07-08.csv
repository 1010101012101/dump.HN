If the hunter-gatherer mode of life couldn't support a large population, how was that limit enforced?  It had to be by people dying.<p>But that wasn't what I was asking anyway.  I wasn't asking why agriculture won, but why it started.  The first agriculturists must have switched from being hunter gatherers.  Why, if life wasn't better?<p>(I realize the switch was a matter of degree, so consider the preceding question as an abbreviation for asking why about each degree of switch.)",1209455608

176403,comment,176367,176367,0,0,gojomo,,,"Looking at the source paper, ""PageRank for Product Image Search"", it's clear this is the same approach Peter Norvig described at SS08.<p>Namely, start with a large set of candidate images based on textual context. Then, create a similarity graph between them using extracted features that are somewhat robust against scaling and other transformations. Then, find the central clusters of that graph, picking the 'most representative' images in the clusters as good, unique results.",1209455281

Someone's either guilty or not.  If they are, there are sentencing guidelines that take various other factors into account.",1209454125

It only takes a few thousand and you can have any app developed.  The technical decisions are critical.

The foundation of a civilization is energy and how much energy a civilization can use. See the Kardashev scale:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale</a><p>I'm trying to say that something could exist that is so fundamentally different from us that it really doesn't care about our existence. Right now, the biggest organisms on earth are fungi. There are some truly enormous fungi. Imagine a fungus or set of fungi that start converting radiation directly to mass for itself to grow. It could expand to surround its local sun. In certain ways, this fungus is more advanced than us, but it would eat us alive without noticing it was doing anything wrong, because it isn't capable of having the thought required to have morality.",1209453715

What&#x27;s changed in the last 20 years?<p>You compare academics in general to a small number of non-academic people and organizations. The latter are not representative of non-academics, because I know people in industry who use the same methods as those in academics. Is Patcher, the author of this piece and an academic, one of the people who uses &quot;old formal methods&quot; due to &quot;reputational and funding risks&quot;?<p>I&#x27;ll add that I mostly work in cheminformatics.

Up until [recently], the prevalent view of scientists had been that the task of controlling aging was fundamentally impossible. But today, such a consensus no longer exists. Many researchers now believe that their predecessors failed, not because their goals were misguided, but because the tools and the level of sophistication they could bring to the task were inadequate. Moreover, it is argued that progress has been hampered because funding has been scarce, and researchers concerned with aging have been too few and far between. ...<p>> Growing public and private support for aging research reflects the scientific community’s own increasing commitment. Today, aging research occupies unprecedented numbers of highly talented individuals, not only\nspecialists in gerontology, but researchers from other disciplines as well. These include biochemistry, endocrinology, immunology, neurobiology, genetics, and cell biology, to name only a few.<p>Before following the link, when do you think that essay was written? <a href=""http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v6p107y1983.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v6p107y1983.pdf</a> .",1436561496

There is nothing inherently wonderful about doing everything client-side.<p>You get a much more limited range of languages and libraries to work with. You get to use overcomplicated build and deployment processes with ever-changing tools. You get to reinvent the wheel if you do want to use things like URI-based routing and browser history in a sensible way. In many cases you are going to need most of the same back-end infrastructure to supply the underlying data anyway.<p>Also, it&#x27;s tough to argue the SPA approach is significantly more efficient if it&#x27;s being compared with a traditional web app built using a server-side framework where switching contexts requests exactly one uncached HTML file, no uncached CSS or JS in many cases, and any specific resources for the new page that you would have had to download anyway.<p>Of course some web apps are sufficiently interactive that you do need to move more of the code client-side, and beyond a certain point you <i>might</i> find it&#x27;s then easier to do everything there instead of splitting responsibilities.

In the middle of that might also be something happening to the position itself -- it was open and available when we listed it, but now the company&#x27;s financials came out and we don&#x27;t know if the position is still available. So we sit on it, for weeks, waiting to hear back from a VP.

You were not and I guarantee that this will happen most of the time.  As an interviewer, we didn&#x27;t handle any of that communication -- you came to me with a resume attached in an e-mail from our hiring team. I don&#x27;t even know how to get in touch with you.

The best advice I can give you there is: add some superficial things.  Get the work mailing address of the person you interviewed with -- the one who is going to make the decision. Write a hand-written Thank You letter expressing your desire for the position. I&#x27;ve gotten <i>one</i> of those in my life, though I&#x27;ve written one every time.

In short, we crunch a huge amount of data for TV networks, movie studios & etc to give them meaningful viewership statistics.  We&#x27;ve been around for 25+ years, and we&#x27;ve necessarily changed a lot in that time (we started out contracting with video rental stores).  We&#x27;re certainly not a startup, but we have a comfortable culture and a strong OSS focus.<p>We&#x27;re hiring mid and senior system administrators and DevOps engineers.  We&#x27;re looking for experience with the following:<p>* Linux (mostly CentOS)<p>* Configuration management (especially Puppet)<p>* Large-scale database management (Postgres)<p>* AWS, VMware & virtualization tools<p>* Storage infrastructure (NetApp, etc)<p>* Monitoring tools<p>* Python and Ruby for DevOps; also a plus for other positions.<p>* We have at least one opening for a Windows admin, too.<p>We&#x27;re also looking for software engineers at all levels.  Our existing infrastructure is generally in C++ and Perl, and new products are generally in Python or Ruby.  Our focus is on handling massive data sets.  Big data & MapReduce technologies, OLAP, large-scale SQL-based DBs, and distributed system experience would all be great.<p>Feel free to contact &quot;colin.hyzy at rentrakmail.com&quot; for more information.  Thanks!",1436560260

9866412,comment,9865474,9865474,0,0,jxramos,,,"I do a lot of amateur repair of various things around the house, washing machines, TV, etc. I remember being really struck by the commentary of this repair book I read:How to Diagnose and Fix Everything Electronic by Michael Geier. He has some insight into this arena in terms of labor costs, and growing complexity of components...<p>&quot;When I was a kid, there were radio and TV servicers in many neighborhoods. If something broke, you dropped it off at your local electronics repair shop, which was as much a part of ordinary life as the corner automotive service garage. These days, those shops have all but disappeared as rising labor costs and device complexity have driven consumer electronics into the age of the disposable machine. When it stops working, you toss it out and get a new one.&quot;<p>He makes some other points too from a deep technician perspective citing how companies began to view and deal with complexity and liability of having their products be user servicable...<p>&quot;...&quot;No user-serviceable parts inside. Refer service to qualified personnel,&quot; replaced the [repair/service] diagrams. Is it any wonder they call today&#x27;s gadgetry &quot;consumer electronics&quot;?\nService manuals were cheap and plentiful, and shops kept huge rows of filing cabinets bursting with them. In addition to manuals generated by the products&#x27; makers, the Howard W Sams company produced its own comprehensive line of Photofact schematics for just about everything out there. If you couldn&#x27;t get a schematic from Zenith, you could get a Sams easily enough for a buck or two.\nAs products got still more complex, manuals grew from a few pages to a few hundred, with large, fold-out schematics and very detailed, color pictorials. Producing these big books became quite expensive, so their prices skyrocketed. Shops continue to buy them--they had little choice--but no consumer would spend more for a manual than the product cost in the first place! Companies gradually reduced and finally abandoned the infrastructure for selling manuals to the public, and today&#x27;s age of &quot;use it, wear it out and toss it&quot; was in full swing. Many manufacturers will no longer sell schematics or service manuals to consumers, thanks in part to fear of potential lawsuits by injured tinkerers. Some companies won&#x27;t even sell manuals to service shops unless they&#x27;re factory-authorized warranty service providers. And, believe it or not, some even refuse to provide diagrams to those facilities! Secretive computer makers, in particular, only let authorized servicers swap boards; the techs work on their machines for years without ever seeing a schematic of one.&quot;",1436558676

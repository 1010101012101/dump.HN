Okay, you&#x27;re officially a grownup, but you can still party! 40 was pause for concern, but it isn&#x27;t what it used to be, the threshold of middle age: that&#x27;s 50. Oops ...<p>Well, as Terry Pratchett observed, inside every old man there&#x27;s an eight year old wondering what just happened. I don&#x27;t feel <i>emotionally</i> middle-aged. But my knees creak in the morning, I&#x27;ve survived medical conditions that would have killed me if I&#x27;d lived a century earlier, I can remember events -- as an adult -- that happened 30 years ago, and I don&#x27;t have the physical stamina, mental agility, or energy of a 30 year old any more.

You&#x27;ve got time to plan a new career or nurture a business ahead of you. But by the time you&#x27;ve hit 50, the future is looking cloudy. You don&#x27;t want to train for a new career to see you through the next 30 years because who the hell wants to be working to pay off student loans when they&#x27;re 80? So you get locked into whatever track you set yourself running down twenty years earlier. Changing is hard because you have less of a future ahead of you to change <i>for</i>.<p>If you&#x27;re under 35, my advice would be to think about that.

Robbery in CA is  2, 3, or 5 years or 3-9 years, depending on the degree, while in UK it&#x27;s 2-7 years or 7 - 12 years, also depending on the degree. The first level of robbery in UK is more attune to Petty or Grand Theft in CA. In CA there is also a GBH enhancement, that will bump you up to the 12 years, just like in the UK.<p>Obviously, I have not done the comparison for all the crimes, but I think if done, we would find that EU and US both have very similar penalties for all the person crimes, like theft, robbery, rape, murder, etc. Where there is a big difference is probably in the crimes that have to do with national obsessions. For US it&#x27;s drugs, guns, terrorism. For EU it&#x27;s WW2 and holocaust, and also terrorism nowadays. But checking drug penalties in UK I also found them to be very similar to Federal statutes in US. [3] Though, if I had to guess, I would think the UK is far less likely to apply it&#x27;s possession only laws. So, that&#x27;s a valid criticism.<p>US does have an insane incarceration rate, but it&#x27;s again due to our obsession with drugs. Take that out of the equation, and we are about even. Not that that makes it all ok, but I think we are on a path to changing that.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/robbery/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/robbery...</a>

10164092,comment,10162180,10163863,0,0,repsilat,,,"Something I&#x27;ve wondered about reference counting and optimising compilers: I assume at a lowish level an inlined function call might look something like,<p><pre><code>    pointer->ref_count += 1
    obj = pointer->ptr
    //...do something with obj...
    pointer->ref_count -= 1
    if pointer->ref_count == 0:
        free(pointer->ptr)
</code></pre>
Assuming ref_count isn&#x27;t messed up by another thread (which I guess we&#x27;re free to do if we haven&#x27;t put locks around it, or declared it volatile?) then you could optimise away the increment and decrement on `ref_count`, right? I guess I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised either way.<p>What I&#x27;d like to know, though, is whether the `ref_count == 0` check could get optimised away as well. To you and me it&#x27;s obvious that the count is positive at the start (as a precondition for the pointer access being correct), but I can&#x27;t really see how an optimising compiler could know that.",1441274956

The problem boils down to self worth. If I truly believe that I am worth (a million dollars|to be funded|a beer|a lesson in rails), then I will get it [1]. In this sense, this tool does a great job of connecting a need to those who can possibly fulfill that need within your social network.<p>Those without the confidence to ask will be left in the dust. They will see this as another divisive tool between the haves and have nots.<p>If you can solve the problem of self worth, that is a billion dollar problem [2]. Its not a problem many of us in the start-up world consider. I think you must have a relatively high enough self worth to with stand failure and keep self promoting a start-ups.<p>We all deserve the very best in life. Some of the unhappy  people I know are afraid to ask for the very best, or just don't think they deserve it. I think your tool is a step in the right direction.<p>[1] Within reason. If I ask for a trillion and believe I'm worth a trillion, I will get what I asked for.

This has been a common tactic for years in any business line where there are plural retail outlets available selling the otherwise identical item.  Each ""outlet"" negotiates a different, outlet specific, model number from the manufacturer, such that they can 1) offer price matching without actually having to ever price match anything and 2) convince the uninitiated that somehow their ""model"" is different, better, faster, softer, etc. than the other outlet's ""model"".  When in reality, both ""models"" are produced on the exact same assembly line, and the only difference is at the very end, outlet #1 has model number 1 attached, and outlet #2 has model number 2 attached.<p>You'll find this tactic in wide use in the furniture and mattress sales arena.  The exact same piece of furniture is a different ""model"" depending on which retail outlet you shop in, or the identical mattress is a different ""model"" depending on which mattress retail store you are standing inside.<p>If anything, it was simply a matter of time before the computer and electronics retail market picked up on the tactic and started utilizing it.",1303484310

And to fix some of these problems (like speed) you have to introduce more complexity.</i><p>There are plenty of contexts where speed is a non-issue.  In those cases, GC has been a huge win.  The conceptual simplicity is the important part.  The cost of the resources that would be saved with explicit and optimized memory management would be far outweighed by the resources required to implement such things.<p><i>The original idea is simple, but nobody uses the original idea because it performs so badly.</i><p>This is simply not true.<p>In the context of IO-bound enterprise systems, I've seen generational GC perform admirably, almost magically.  As a lark, I've put infinite loops into such apps that do nothing but allocate new objects, and unless you are doing an exceptionally intense operation, you couldn't tell the difference.  Properly tuned generational GC can be a truly fantastic seeming thing!<p>However, I will agree that the concerns Linus highlights are real, and that refcounting systems, like the one in iOS are by far better choices in many contexts.<p>EDIT: The above system I victimized, I only victimized in the TEST environment, but it was populated with something like 2-week old production data.  The application in question is a traditional client/server desktop app used by a major energy company and had 800 active users at the time, handling millions in transactions every minute.<p>IDEA: If someone had an augmented ref-counting system with a runtime containing an optional cycle-detector and something like LINT but for the runtime reference graph, one would get most of the benefits of GC with the efficiency of the ref-counting system.  I half expect someone to tell me that this already exists for Python.",1303484201

It feels like the device is struggling to handle simple tasks and it destroys the belief in the UI metaphor of physical objects that have inertia and flow, stretch and bounce when you touch and flick them.<p>IMO, because it makes such a huge difference to users, UI programming should always happen in a high performance language and environment. One way to attain this performance is to eschew garbage collection.

2474168,comment,2473932,2473932,18,0,jfr,,,"> <i>A GC system with explicitly visible reference counts (and immediate freeing) with language support to make it easier to get the refcounts right [...]</i><p>To be a little pedantic on the subject, such a system (reference counting and immediate freeing) is a form of automatic memory management, but it is not GC in any way. Garbage collection implies that the system leaves <i>garbage</i> around, which needs to be <i>collected</i> in some way or another. The usual approach to refcounting releases resources as soon as they are no longer required (either by free()ing immediately or by sending it to a pool of unused resources), thus doesn't leave garbage around, and doesn't need a collector thread or mechanism to.<p>There are partial-GC implementations of refcounting, either because items are not free()d when they reach zero references, or to automatically detect reference loops which are not handled directly.<p>I agree with Torvalds on this matter. GC as it is promoted today is a giant step that gives programmers one benefit, solving one problem, while introducing a immeasurable pile of complexity to the system creating another pile of problems that are still not fixed today. And to fix some of these problems (like speed) you have to introduce more complexity.<p>This is my problem with GC. I like simplicity. Simplicity tends to perform well, and being simple also means it has little space for problems. Refcounting is simple and elegant, you just have to take care of reference loops, which also has another simple solution, that is weak references. I can teach a class of CS students everything they need to know to design a refcounting resource management system in one lesson.<p>GC is the opposite: it is big, complex, and a problem that the more you try to fix it, the more complex it becomes. The original idea is simple, but nobody uses the original idea because it performs so badly. To teach the same class how to design a GC system that performs as well as we expect today, an entire semester may not be enough.",1303482876

2474144,comment,2466059,2468793,2,0,6ren,,,"I didn't realize ARM was so much less profitable than intel. It's partly because ARM's model of development is shared with its licensees (e.g. Apple's A5 is based on ARM, but customized inhouse, and I believe uses third-party components); so a fairer comparison of the ARM ""business"" would include all these designers, assemblers and distributors, as well as the chip manufacturers you mention. The ARM model is ""dis-integrated"", both in stages (design, manufacturing, marketing) and in components within a particular SoC. Intel is ""integrated"" on all those fronts (even to consumer advertising - those funky cleansuits, ""intel-inside""). The other factor is that Intel is stunningly profitable, due to the wintel franchise.<p>There's huge prediction issue here, of what will happen to the smart-phone market, that reasonable people could disagree about. I believe it will disrupt ""PCs"", just as PCs disrupted workstations/mini-computers, which disrupted mainframes (the latter of each may still exist, but only in the most demanding applications in the highest tiers).<p>The reason is that as it improves in performance, it will become good enough for more and more applications (while the PC's improvement will make it more powerful than most applications need); and also offer other benefits: size, consumption, mobility (and multi-touch, GPS, camera). If you can plug your smartphone into your HDMI monitor, mouse and keyboard, and have all your information there, would you still use your desktop?<p>As for the server, it's widely reported that power consumption is the dominant issue as they grow in size. SSD are of interest for this reason... and ARM cpus will be also. The crucial dimension is processing power/power consumption. Intel is not ahead on this score, only in raw performance per power-hungry cpu. But the really amazing difference is that because the ARM architecture is open to customization, it is possible to optimize silicon performance for highly specialized tasks - instead of writing time-critical code in C, or assembler, you write it in silicon. Or, more generally, you write time-critical modules in silicon, like crucial parts of what key-value stores are doing.<p>I think we may see the rise of startups integrated along silicon-software lines - like Apple is. Oracle is trying to do this (with Sun's SPARC). Imagine the performance advantage you could get with this! You would annihilate the competition.<p>I totally agree with your last line about the windows franchise. Once webapps and the cloud get their act together (I'm looking at you reddit/amazon), it seems that windows could indeed be obsolete (as long-forecasted).<p>OTOH, incumbents traditionally win their markets, even through dramatic technology changes, because they know their customers (they have trouble when their customers change). But this is usually when the market demands more of the same thing... In the server market, power consumption has become more of an issue, over raw processing power, and Intel has already been adapting to it. But they don't have ARM's experience in low-power consumption, nor the flexibility of architecture to optimize for it.<p>The only difficulty I have is that my analysis predicts that ARM has already won the server market...<p>There's also an aging factor, in that the firebrand startup founders that made it all happen - andy grove, gordon moore, etc - have retired. Look at HP without H and P.",1303482427

You got 19 arithmetic instructions or 4 memory instructions, or something in between (without checking your math, but as I recall, that's roughly right).<p>There are basically two inner loop types in a game like Doom - the wall loop and the floor loop.  The wall loop renders a vertical strip of pixels on a wall and the floor loop renders a horizontal strip of floor.  Each of these loops is actually rather trivial to write and just walks over the pixels reading an input texel, modulate by lighting, and then write out to the screen buffer. (<i></i>Actually, Doom had transparent textures for some walls, so that's a third type of loop).  The wall loop is slightly simpler because it can be an axis aligned walk through the input texture.<p>There really isn't very much room to optimize these loops.  You can unroll them.  You can play with how you do the adds and carrys and maybe shave off another instruction.  For walls, you can organize your texture data so that vertical neighbors are consecutive in memory.

Either way, it&#x27;s a pretty simple way way to feed an entire extended family on a single dish.<p>The Turkduckens you get from www.cajungrocer.com are actually prepared by Hebert&#x27;s Meats (from Maurice, LA) and unlike the Wikipedia article, have intermediary layers if stuffing consisting of Jambalaya and Shrimp and Crawfish touffe.<p>You don&#x27;t have to be born and raised a Cajun to appreciate them, but it may help to have some Cajuns on hand if you want to finish one of these delights.

It allows two applications to communicate with each other using the dbus serialisation and abstracts the transport layer. You can use it over a Unix socket and then it&#x27;s just a serialisation format like any application using IPC would need. Then, using dbus is no more stupid than anything else. Actually, it&#x27;s pretty clever as there already is quite a lot of tools understanding this format.<p>However, libdus is not what people usually talk about when they talk of dbus. The core part of dbus and what could bother server administrator is the message bus daemon which allows any applications to expose their functionalities and talk to any others. Now, systemd can use the message bus to allow applications to ask for service activation. But, it&#x27;s not required and you can run the init system without it.",1374420149

You know, caring too much and whatnot, or caring about things you can&#x27;t change in a way as if you could.<p>Personally, I find the heat death of the universe comforting. That is, considering human society as it is now: no matter what, there will be no boot stamping on a human face <i>forever</i>. Those who &quot;become one with the dust&quot; cannot loose, those into accumulation of power and posessions can&#x27;t win. That&#x27;s kinda neat, after all, like a fail-safe. It&#x27;s also the only real solid argument for things like compassion and irony I know.<p><i>You are here because thousands of generations of humans have found ways to cope and carry on and make today into a better tomorrow.</i><p>You could also say I&#x27;m here because hunger feels bad and fucking feels good. &quot;Better tomorrow&quot; sounds so self-righteous, and while maybe people in the past were that high-minded, I&#x27;m currently not seeing it. The US can&#x27;t even close Gitmo because the people they abducted and tortured might take it out on them, wtf? We still live in the stone age in so many ways, and that&#x27;s the supposedly advanced west. A few years ago in Germany, a girl was raped in the inner city of a small town while people just walked by. And so on. It could be argued that even one look at a flower justifies all suffering in the world, but it could also be argued that just one kid dying in terror and pain does not justify existence of life on the planet. It really depends on the mood, and for me on wether I had breakfast yet.<p>Remember when TV was thought to bring culture and information to people? Hah, me neither, but I take it there was a time when you could express such hope with a straight face. Then came the internet... yet the way 99% of the people talk on the web would get one hellbanned within 5 posts here. For every person with a book I see, I see 20 with their dumbification phone out. In the economy we consider shifting money to those who least deserve, but most desperately want it, as <i>making</i> money and admirable, and watch helplessly as our media, our food, just about fucking everything gets more and more consolidated into fewer and fewer trees of corporations and the corporations they own. All most people care about is what they need to do to get along, they just accept everything as given and go from there.<p>And yeah, then there&#x27;s the people dreaming of actual immortality in all this mess. Just <i>look at them</i>. They&#x27;ve been creeping me out since I was a kid, not once have I seen a scientist talk about this who seemed to be a balanced human being.<p>Anyway, as Kafka wrote in his notebook, <i>&quot;Believing in progress does not mean believing that any progress has yet been made.&quot;</i> But then again he also wrote this: <i>&quot;You can hold yourself back from the sufferings of the world, that is something you are free to do and it accords with your nature, but perhaps this very holding back is the one suffering you could avoid.&quot;</i><p>But that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re talking about, children dying in Africa, is it? Or people who just want to feel like they have some agency in their life playing Farmville? No, the universe is oh so exiting, it&#x27;s an awesome ride... bleh. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I sometimes still stare at clouds or my hand or whatever and am simply amazed. But a sense of wonder is only one part of the story, the other part is human society, which is nowhere near the awesome complex miracle the universe is, but often rather banal, predictable, suicidal on good days and murderous on bad ones, with ads everywhere, just in case someone has an actual thought in a quiet minute.<p>I still agree that one should not give up, if that can be avoided. But I disagree that &quot;if they figured out a way to give a damn, you can, too.&quot; -- so many people didn&#x27;t figure anything out (how many natives are basically dying from depression in reservations?), and if they couldn&#x27;t, why should I be able to? We live on a planet where Stalin and Hitler and Mao actually happened, where the US is actually a thing, and where there is no reason to believe power, control and deception will not be absolute and insubvertible one day -- until the heat death of the universe, that is.<p>People who don&#x27;t give up do that for themselves; they don&#x27;t don&#x27;t owe it to anyone. Maybe to the people who love them, maybe to themselves, but not to any old random schmuck of the past.

Since we&#x27;re behind a corporate firewall and require various HTTP proxies to hit the outside world I devised pretty much the same setup as explained in the article.<p>All of the environment exports are placed in .profile as, at the very least, I expect this to be sourced on a login shell. If there is a non-login shell, for the most part, most people tend to source it pretty early on in the process. The .bash_profile is kept around for diagnostic information for interactive shells such as the Ruby, Go, Node and Java versions of the machine you are logging into.<p>Because everyone tends to have their own dotfiles I hijacked the .bash_login to keep machine specific information which can be optionally sourced. This leads me to tell people to basically keep .profile and .bash_login out of their revision control and to source both of them relatively early on in the login process.<p>All .profile is for environment variables that are machine/network specific. If you have any overrides, e.g. aliases, all that goes into your .bash_login.<p>My .bash_profile:

6078973,comment,6078575,6078897,3,0,bittired,,,"IQ not intelligence. IQ is meant to be a measure of intellectual capacity. It is nonsensical to say that someone is unable to be intelligent because they are poor.<p>Let&#x27;s talk about intelligence, though. Lets say that everyone had the same intellectual capacity, but we still saw the same descrepancy in how well they did on standardized tests. Having little to eat and poor schools do not keep a child from learning from others. There is ready access to the internet through libraries in the U.S. with a wealth of information online, and a lot of books on the shelves there also. If you take away all genetic factors (tendency towards aggression, lower intellectual capacity, etc.) and environmental factors (is the child worried about being shot, peer pressure to join a gang or get into drugs or alcohol, etc.), then in the end it is more about <i>parenting</i> and <i>community</i>, not about <i>poverty</i>. If we were able to teach good parenting skills, social skills, and ethics adequately in schools, and help them develop sense of community, then many of the problems (unrelated to genetics) related to intelligence being lower would go away. I hope if anyone takes home anything from what I&#x27;m saying, it is that you can&#x27;t throw money at a problem like this. Welfare can make things much worse (misusing food funds for drugs, setting up a cycle of dependence on government funds, etc.), but welfare is a perfectly logical solution to lack of money. We made that mistake before, and can&#x27;t have a whole new generation of people buying into that statist crap.<p>However, back to the study. Genetic problems with IQ cannot be solved by money, period. Also, being poor does not make you have lower potential for intelligence. That has been my point all over this thread.",1374418892

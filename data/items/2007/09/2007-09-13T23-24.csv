54441,comment,54413,54440,0,0,zach,,,"I totally agree (I'm reasonably comfortable with total strangers emailing me), but if I, say, meet someone at a trade show then there seems like there's a higher level of acceptability to it than ""hey, remember me, I responded to your blog post.""  Maybe it's just me, though?",1189726773

54439,comment,54413,54413,0,0,zach,,,"Well, this of course points out that there are not many online equivalents of going to a friend's party, volunteering with others or a business mixer -- facilitated real-life scenarios where people are, effectively, socially introduced.  Somewhere you can meet someone, have some one-on-one chat and maybe exchange a business card, phone number or email address.  That's a socially acceptable starting point for a friendly relationship.<p>People need those starting points.  If you meet some guy at a TechCrunch party and talk for a couple minutes, it is perfectly acceptable to email him with some question a week later.  But if you just comment on a blog post he makes, even if he responds in another comment, you're still effectively a stranger.  You can email them, but it better sound a little apologetic.  You sure as heck aren't going to ask to add him to your social network.",1189726341

Apparently because they get solicited for money all the time, a lot of them get very paranoid about being taken advantage of.",1189725706

54429,comment,54008,54008,0,0,mattm,,,"The study mentioned by the article failed to take any biological recordings from the participants.  My guess would be that playing the violent video games causes a rise in testosterone.  Since women have less, a rise in their testosterone levels would impact them more hence the evening out of the test scores.  Just my theory.

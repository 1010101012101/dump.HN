If the problem space is fixed, eventually the list of answers is formulated if it is worth.  In practice if spammer's think it's not worth we can outperform them by more problems, but that's kind of passive, giving up control to them.  In general, what matters is asymptotic ratio of our cost vs spammer's cost---if it is both linear, it's not very promising.  If the ratio reaches zero asymptotically, it means the more we and spammers compete the better we do, hence the control is ours.",1203040494
116219,comment,116169,116169,0,0,webwright,,,"I would suggest letting go of the idea that you've created much value.<p>One way to look at it is this:<p>If he came on TOMORROW and both of you busted ass for 12 months, how much of the value at the end of that 12 months would have been built before he came on?  How about in 4 years (your standard vesting plan)?<p>The thing to key on is VESTING.  Make damn sure that he gets ownership in a trickle (starting after a few months maybe as a trial period)...  But make sure they he can eventually get really close to being an equal partner (maybe a touch less than 50% due to the fact that you got started a touch early).",1203040464

It's very different from the more progressive metros. Given your post I can probably ask you the same question, ""Have you ever lived in the South?""",1203039374
116209,comment,116169,116203,0,0,edw519,,,"Pretty good two cents.  I have a feeling that's what will happen.<p>I often remember the words of Felix Dennis who says he'll do just about anything to succeed---except give up equity.  That advice runs counter to much of the thinking here.  Then again, Dennis is a billionaire.  His book, How to Get Rich, is one of my favorites.

You come in this country at a late age (i.e. 55+)<p>There are really no other reasons.  I have two families, one of my uncle, and one of my first cousin, that came to the US (with green cards), and had to restart their lives all from the beginning.<p>All they had was 5k.  For a family of 4, that is very little, and goes by very fast,  yet, 10 years later, they are both doing great.<p>My uncle had to work as pizza deliver person, then truck driver, until found a good job in a car dealership.  His wife, had to be a waitress for a while  (it sucked, as she was not good for it), but eventually ended up becoming a ""accountant helper"" for a hospital.  8 years later, she is primary person, managing their money,  both of their kids ended up in good private schools, and now one goes to Dartmouth, the other to a good college. They own a house, (bought at reasonable rates, before this buble), cars and all that, living the true american dream.<p>My other's cousin family, is having a little bit harder time, as they have to get menial jobs, but my cousin became a teacher assistent, (teaching french), and eventually she would move up to something better,  while their kids are doing great in school.<p>As I said, poverty is b/c ignorance.  If these two families, can move from a different continent, and re-build everything from scratch, and provide great education to their kids, then everybody else can.<p>In this country hard work, and perseverance will pay off.  B!tching about your conditions, and doing nothing about it, wont.<p>Sure, you can blame racism, but from experience, it is not that.  It is the huge amount of hard work and ethical mentality, and the strong family values that drives all these immigrant families, who while starting dirt poor, they do well, and much better than the american born poor.",1203039277

This guy read Prozac nation or one of the many ""Reality Books"" that are populuar these days and decided, ""I know, I'll go talk to publishers and see if they'll pay for a book like this based on my experiences.""<p>He found a publisher, then went to get some ""experience"" to write about.

Maybe at this stage, it's better to finish the prototype by yourself, and at that point try to get funding? Once you have funding (or can afford to self-fund, which I can't), just hire the person with the tech skills that you need, instead of giving equity? Just my two cents.",1203038247

He KNEW he could succeed; that's often half the battle.<p>Many down and out people can't imagine succeeding, so they don't.<p>This story reminds me of Robert Allen's old claim, ""Put me anywhere in the United States with no money, and by the end of the day I will own some real estate.""  He did it every time.  And to this day, with my limited real estate knowledge, I don't know if I could do the same thing even once.<p>Nice story, but run4yourlives is right; it doesn't really prove anything except that it's mostly in your head.

There's a weight of literature on the value of freedom (e.g. John Locke, Voltaire), and little inquiry in this regard.""<p>I mean, if we continually capitulate to those parties and politicians who support anti-democracy, anti-freedom ideas and laws, why wouldn't there be substance to the argument? Where on earth do you see republicans loosening any laws except tax-based ones? Is that really all there is to freedom? Freedom to spend money the way you see fit? Why do we have to twist ourselves into ideological pretzels about freedom when all it takes is ""low taxes = true freedom""? Our speech and actions get limited, our freedom of movement is impinged by naked scanners and crotch invasions. I mean, the theory is sound, I agree (Lock, Voltaire, hell go back to Seneca the Younger while we're reminiscing), but the reality doesn't. Not here in the US, not in Europe, not anywhere. It really is a matter of ""the system would work great if it weren't for the users"". In our case, the user is the electorate.<p>""The vast majority of tea party anxiety over Obama was that he was restricting freedom too much.""<p>How, exactly? If anything, he's loosened the reins and widened the locus of control through more open governance. It's the tea party that propose, among other disparate things, placing homeless people in prison barracks, not knowing where in the constitution declared the separation of church and state, and wanting to bring back bartering chickens and other goods for medical care. They are all, of course, almost bombastically fervent about a strong military, and support the wars.<p>The only freedom they were afraid of was freedom from paying high taxes, and I think to a person _no one_ really wants to pay really high taxes. Ask even bleeding hearts like me and I'll say ""yeah, I don't really want to pay really high taxes"". But, that seriously seems to be the only platform upon which the Tea Party hung their ""freedom"" watch; else why weren't they gathering in DC against the PATRIOT act and Guantanamo Bay?",1289775044

You can prove this easily, if you count India as a Western democracy, or harder, if you don't (US + South America (except for Venezuela) + Mexico + Western Europe).<p>>there are some cultures to which democratization is simply incompatible<p>There's no evidence <i>at all</i> to believe that democracy wouldn't work in China, as it's never been tried. On the other hand, if you look at the downfall of the Soviet Union, Russia's experiment with democracy has been quite a success, even if it's not so perfect a freedom as we're party to in the US. It's certainly not Stalinist and the very existence of organized resistance movements in Russia, something that would have been entirely unheard-of thirty years ago, is a sign that they've made huge strides in the right direction, and their global standing seems to have benefited.<p>>Even here in the US, we're finding that our rights to move freely must be tempered by TSA searches, PATRIOT act and other impingements in the name of security<p>If by ""security"" you mean ""security theatre"", then sure. The vast majority of academics disagree with the new restrictions, and most people I know think they're absurd.<p>>What if that is actually the end-run for civilization and it's actually the US that is behind the political ideology curve?<p>Let's all hope not! I cannot understand this argument, as there seems to be no substance to it. There's a weight of literature on the value of freedom (e.g. John Locke, Voltaire), and little inquiry in this regard.<p>>We seem to be moving inexorably toward China-like ""freedom with caveats"" direction, and the electorate actually seems to prefer it<p>I have no idea how you could come to this conclusion. The vast majority of tea party anxiety over Obama was that he was restricting freedom <i>too much</i>. The main issue of the protesters was that their freedom was threatened, at least in their perception, and whether the candidates they chose are actually working to improve freedom is not quite so relevant as the reasons they chose such candidates.<p>Quite the contrary, just two weeks ago the US state of California came closer to legalizing marijuana than has any other entity for the past thirty years. A general movement toward restricted freedom, indeed. We're seeing such major gains such as legalized abortion and gay marriage even in highly religious regions such as South America and, aparently, Tunisia, and many countries with a long history of human rights violations, e.g. Bangladesh, Vietnam, Nicaragua, have improved markedly in recent years -- the current state of affairs is close to the freeest many such countries have ever seen. You don't hear about all the good things happening in the world in the news as much, but they're happening. The doctrine that freedom of speech is an inalienable human right may have been implemented in the US some 234 years ago, but it only became international law 60 years ago.

The SEC requires any company that wants to sell shares to register with it. There are exceptions to this registration requirement. One of these being that a company is exempt if it sells shares to an ""accredited investor"".<p>The definition of ""accredited investor"" since 1982 has been someone with a net worth of $1 million or $200K annual income or $300K combined income with spouse.\n<a href=""http://www.sec.gov/answers/accred.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/answers/accred.htm</a><p>By changing/increasing the ""accredited investor"" threshold, presumably less people would be able to invest in startups that are not registered with the SEC. Hence this rule would lead to fewer angels. BTW, the change being proposed is that an investor cannot include his primary residence in calculating his net worth.<p>More history of the ""accredited investor"" rule can be found here - <a href=""http://webster.utahbar.org/barjournal/2010/11/the_evolution_and_future_of_th.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webster.utahbar.org/barjournal/2010/11/the_evolution_...</a><p>[EDIT] Here is a rationale for the existence of the ""accredited investor"" rule taken from the utahbar link above:<p>Since as early as the 1930s, regulators and courts have struggled with how to protect individual investors in private offerings of securities while still allowing sufficient investment in private offerings to sustain the growth of start-up and other young companies – companies which have historically been responsible for much of the job growth in the United States.<p>Eventually, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) came up with the idea of “accredited investors.” Accredited investors are individuals or other entities that have sufficient wealth not to need the protection of federal and state securities laws to the same extent as non-accredited investors.",1289773734

I rarely did homework assignments and never took notes.<p>There's also an interesting thing you can do with standardized tests, where you infer the answer from the questions and the other answers given.  Standardized test authors are actually really predictable: they usually think of multiple choice options based on common error patterns, so if you look at the answers and think ""Well, those two are off by one, and those two have factors that are off by one, and those two are what you get if you add instead of multiply"", you can triangulate between them and come up with the right answer even if you don't understand the question.<p>Actually, I once did an experiment to try and quantify this effect.  Throughout high school, a bunch of my classmates would say, ""You're not really smart, you're just a good test taker.""  So I figured I'd take the AP Comparative Government without ever having taken the class or done any self-study.  Just a half hour of reading a test-prep book over breakfast.   I <i>knew</i> I didn't know anything about the subject, so any score I got could be solely attributable to test-taking skills.<p>I got a 3 on it, which is a passing grade for many colleges.  I got a 5 (the highest) on the tests that I actually <i>did</i> know the subject area, so it wasn't all test-taking.<p>It was funny though - the AP Comp Gov is a big multiple-choice section followed by 4 essay tests, and I obviously didn't know the subject, so I'd have to bullshit the essays.  So I did the multiple choice through a combination of looking for patterns in the answers and using my common-sense knowledge of foreign governments that I'd picked up from newspapers.  And then I used the questions they'd asked in the multiple choice section as talking points for the essay.  Basically, I was using the test itself to answer the questions on the test.",1289772540

I was just pointing out the theories and implications behind the example of a seemingly simple choice as ""cap Medicare"".<p>Also there are important historical questions like how did we get to this point -- something traditional MSM like the NYT has been horrible at explaining.  These political issues are raised mid-stream (e.g. how do we cut spending or raise taxes to balance the budget) without any context or question of causes.  For example, the other issue I mentioned, income tax exemption for employer-provided health insurance, arose from a prior policy of wage and price controls during WWII. Employers were banned from offering higher wages so they offered non-taxable benefits as a substitute as a means to circumvent the controls and effectively raise wages.  The point here being that capping Medicare will be a failure like capping prices and wages during WWII and lead to all kinds of unwanted effects, including further increasing the complexity of the tax code and the government intrusion into our lives.<p>I also agree that irrational and impossible demands on the government will continue until ""economic wreckage"" puts an end to it.  If we somehow ""solve"" the budget crisis through some combination of tax increases and spending decreases, but people continue to believe that the government is Santa Claus, then any such solution will be temporary at best. Given these socio-political realities, the end point, in my judgment, is hyperinflation and the destruction of the dollar.  I sincerely hope that I am wrong.<p>Edit: Spelling",1289772455

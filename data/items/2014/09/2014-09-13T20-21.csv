They did this by finding\n    variations in the orbital period of the binary, variations\n    caused by the changing light travel time as the binary\n    orbits a third star.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nTranslated: the binary star system is co-orbiting a third object, whose pull on the binary is so strong that it must be star-sized rather than planet-sized. How do they measure this pull? It&#x27;s a Doppler effect -- not the familiar one, a shift in the frequency of waves (like sound) -- but a shift in the <i>frequency of the binary star orbit</i>! This orbit is a clock with a constant 0.258 day period between ticks. When the binary is moving towards earth, these clock ticks are &quot;catching up&quot; [0] with the starlight moving towards earth -- they&#x27;re compressed together, so the binary <i>looks</i> like it&#x27;s orbiting faster than it actually is! If you measure this Doppler shift, how it changes as the binary orbits the third star (first moving slightly faster towards earth, then away from it), you can infer the speed of its orbit around the third star -- and from that, the mass of the third star!<p>I was just reading about this recently: I was going to say (wrongly) this technique was used by in the 17th century to measure the speed of light, by measuring a Doppler shift of the orbital period of Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io [1]. In fact Ole Rømer measured the <i>phase</i> of Io&#x27;s orbit, rather than the frequency. You can track Io&#x27;s orbit phase very exactly by timing the moment it falls behind Jupiter&#x27;s horizon (a regular eclipse). With Io&#x27;s orbit as a clock located at Jupiter (the eclipse moment as the &quot;tick&quot;), you can measure differences in light travel time from Jupiter to Earth as they move apart. This is a phase measurement, not frequency; and it depends on the Jupiter-Earth distance, not their relative speed.<p>[0] Like this GIF: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect#mediaviewer/File:Dopplerfrequenz.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect#mediaviewer/Fil...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rømer&#x27;s_determination_of_the_speed_of_light"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rømer&#x27;s_determination_of_the_s...</a><p>(§8.2 says my confusion is a common one, so there!)",1410641101

8313435,comment,8313137,8313137,4,0,Theodores,,,"This is great history, however there is more to the craze of mountain biking than these tales of pioneering legend.<p>History can be taught as &#x27;kings, queens and their wars&#x27; or it can be told in terms of economic and social things. With the mountain biking craze not much has been written about why it did take off like it did - really very few people knew who Fisher, Breeze, Ritchey et al. were. People just wanted a mountain bike for some reason.<p>I also don&#x27;t believe that these mountain bike pioneers were really that pioneering - since the invention of the bicycle people have been cycling off road and enjoying the thrills of descending at speed. It is kind of a natural thing to do. To a certain extent the bikes that came before mountain bikes - BMX - were off-road bikes albeit with small wheels although you could get medium flavour wheels with a BMX.<p>My revisionist view of the mountain bike craze is to see it as a natural reaction to what politicians, planners and motorists were doing to our roads. Back in the day roads were many times more deadly than they are today with country roads unrestricted so &#x27;idiots&#x27; could drive them far too fast to possibly stop for any cyclists that might be using them. As a consequence, in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s roads were not at all safe for cyclists and the only cyclists that would use them would be doing so for reasons different to today.<p>As well as the instant danger roads back then were laced with deadly poisons from cars that are incredible to think about. Imagine putting lead in petrol?!? Who would have thought that was a good idea?<p>Cycling is enjoyable - that is a statement of fact. Cycling on dangerous roads is no fun at all (unless you really enjoy that, which I can understand). So mountain bikes came along and just filled a need for something that had been denied by the motoring thing.<p>Shimano did great things to get mountain biking started - they did a fantastic job of creating easy to service brakes, gears and other components. European component suppliers just did not get their act together which was their loss. Yet again, despite how wonderful Shimano were there were wider economic factors - the Yen was a fairly worthless currency at the time so Shimano parts were amazingly cheap given how high quality they were compared to their European counterparts.<p>The frames for the bikes and the bikes themselves tended to come from &#x27;new&#x27; suppliers. Older brands that made &#x27;lugged&#x27; frames lost out. The factories in the Far East (Taiwan) that had been built to TiG weld chromoly steel tubes were the ones making the mountain bikes. For them this was a natural progression from the BMX that had gone before. As contract manufacturers &#x27;OEM partners&#x27; they took the brands that the likes of Fisher had started and churned out some real product, this being the right product at the right time.<p>Mountain bikes also rode on the crest of a wave of a consumer boom. Money was cheap and along with all the other consumer gizmos of the time, mountain bikes sold very nicely.<p>So, although the Marin County history is fun, the real story of why the mountain bike happened has more to do with the tragedy of the roads and economic circumstance at home and in the Far East.",1410639488

8313416,comment,8304403,8306036,2,0,hellgas00,,,"You kind of jump around from point to point. If your hand is wrapped around a a source of electricity (Assuming that it&#x27;s not static charge and can provide a current equal to the source voltage over your bodies resistance) I&#x27;m sorry but you are not going to let go, even if you are hanging from the wire. Until a formation of soot has formed and the oils in your hands have burned off to increase the resistance, there is no letting go.<p>Let me give a couple of reasons why AC just as dangerous as DC.<p>1) Your body shares some of the same characteristics a capacitor, a capacitor with small capacitance, but one none the less. This means that an AC current can shock you without forming a classical circuit that would be needed for a shock from DC.<p>2) You mention RMS as a reason why AC is safer? The root mean squared voltage of AC is going to be less then the peak voltage induced by the name plate voltage. Wall socket voltage may by 120V RMS but will peak around 170V.<p>3) With a peak voltage of 170V the current through a resistor (like a human body) is going to be ~40% greater than that of an average 120V for DC. Stating that current kills but voltage doesn&#x27;t is also ridiculous (unless you are talking about static charges). It would be like saying that the flow rate of water down a stream is dependent on the amount of water in the stream and not the speed of the flowing water. The fallacy is also point out in the link your provided.<p>4) Hearts are much more likely to suffer from complication due alternating current than from direct current<p>Again, I stand by my initial assertion, both AC and DC are just as dangerous. Anecdotal stories, while entertaining, don&#x27;t mean much considering that you may have been hydrated while dealing with DC, which can increase the bodies internal resistance greatly. You may have been more grounded, you may have been touching a piece of metal that was grounded, the circuit may have been created across the chest which gives a nasty shock. There are many external variables which can alter your perception of what it feeling like while being electrocuted.",1410639119

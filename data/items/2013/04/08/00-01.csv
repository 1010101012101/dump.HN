While it is easy to get up and running quite easily in R for simple analysis, it is a complex language that takes years to master.  I recommend learning Python for the aspiring scientist because of its breadth of applicability.   While R is probably better for statistical analysis than Python (every language has its specific domain where it shines), across the entire domain of tasks a data scientist must perform, I feel that Python provides the best aggregate utility.<p>Also, as the comments below highlight, actual statistical analysis is but a small part of the data pipeline.   Python has great facilities for interacting with data stores/sources in addition to being a powerful tool to clean and munge data.<p>>When I think about, in my data programming related work, I'd say about 5% is doing analysis or executing statistical routines. And 95% of my time is spent on finding, cleaning, and properly normalizing data.<p>I hope the post doesn't downplay the importance of R to statistical analysis, it is a mature language with a great community surrounding it.  The toolset of a data scientist is probably one of the most heterogeneous out there and necessitates learning and using many different abstractions.<p>For such a new (and hard to define) subject, I think dialogue is crucial to constructively advance the field. I would love to hear suggestions from the HN community about how to train the next generation of data scientist, what aspiring data scientists want to learn (or find difficult to learn), and how we can build a great data community.",1365382461

The sense I've gotten is that ""startup"" means something very different from starting a business with your own money and contacts, and with monetization already figured out.<p>The latter makes a lot of sense to me, especially as a reason to quit a salaried position in an established company. So, I'm not sure it's fair to say that you prefer startups; it sounds like you just prefer to work with who you want and on whatever you want. There's much less risk there, versus what I've seen ""startup"" defined as, particularly because you've already worked well with your partners in a previous successful venture.<p>(P.S. - Hi George!

It reminds me a bit of the genetic programming work (aside: GP and genetic algos are different schools of research) on evolving programs where the genome is a string of assembler instructions.<p>Markov chain Monte Carlo would appear on its face to be better suited to this problem than a pure GP approach; at least to speed up convergence to a solution. It's actually quite different from GP -- no crossovers, more global state etc. Maybe a flock/swarm optimiser approach would be a better analogy in the nature-inspired computation world.<p>I'd be interested to know whether they experimented with other cost functions. For example, in some schemes, some candidates which fall outside the acceptable solution state (eg code that doesn't run, code that produces the wrong answer) are simply culled. In some you try to perform ""repairs"". In this case they've taken the other common approach of assigning a cost to incorrectness.",1365381978

A lot of charities you give money but it is for a somewhat amorphous problem, to ""fight hunger"" or ""help fund education"" or ""research a cure for cancer"". These are all noble causes but it is somehow less personally fulfilling because you can't see any near term changes and just have to tell yourself perhaps your donation helped in some small way.

There is simply no one in place with the right incentives to make sure that the data is updated/cleaned with any regularity. Dow Jones VentureSource and Thomson ONE have databases that track venture capital rounds fairly accurately, although obviously there are a ton of deals that are never exposed to the outside world, and there are rarely regulatory requirements that such things be disclosed.<p>Even when you have the data though, it's hard to tell which investors are actually still doing deals. There are a lot of small funds out there that may not do a deal every 6 months even when they are still actively looking, perhaps because they are in the tail end of their investment period and are trying to be very selective, or perhaps because their typical bite size is large relative to the capital they have to deploy. There are also investors who will tell you that they are continuing to look at deals even when they aren't in a position to invest because they don't have committed capital and it doesn't look good to be out of the market. So all around it's a pretty fuzzy condition that you are looking to describe.<p>Of course, having a list is still nicer than not having a list, because if you simply ""tap your network"" for active funds, people will just think about who they've interacted with recently, rather than actually having any knowledge about the specific proclivities of the country's hundreds of venture capital firms, organized angels, etc. It's easy to overlook reasonable candidates.",1365380238

Working on Ember Data has been one of the most challenging efforts of my career, but I think that it has the opportunity to dramatically change how people write web applications. Once we've stabilized it, of course. :)<p>Here are the specific steps we're taking to address your concerns:<p>1. Thanks to a pull request from Stanley Stuart[1], we now automatically publish builds of Ember Data[2] every time a new commit is pushed that passes our suite of tests.<p>2. We have begun documenting Ember Data[3] and, while not exhaustive, what we have now is significantly better than just a little while ago. As with what happened with Ember.js, we take documentation very seriously and you should see the Ember Data documentation improve dramatically over time.<p>3. As we outlined in a recent blog post[4], we are focused on stabilizing Ember Data and do not have plans for new features at this time. If we made a mistake in the initial API design, it was not providing enough imperative trap doors to use when the declarative APIs were not sufficient. We are working on fixing that.<p>Thanks to our friends at Addepar, we are able to dedicate several full days per week to Ember Data and you should see the velocity of the project increase significantly. Many observers have noticed the recent flurry of commit activity[5]; this was not an aberration but an indication of what the future holds now that we have daytime hours to dedicate to it.<p>If you have specific suggestions for how to make Ember Data as approachable as possible, please let me know. Like I said, my focus right now is on eliminating bugs, stabilizing APIs, and making sure new developers don't hit frustrating rough spots.<p>1: <a href=""https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/850"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/850</a><p>2: <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/builds.emberjs.com/ember-data-latest.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://s3.amazonaws.com/builds.emberjs.com/ember-data-lates...</a><p>3: <a href=""http://emberjs.com/guides/models/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emberjs.com/guides/models/</a><p>4: <a href=""http://emberjs.com/blog/2013/03/22/stabilizing-ember-data.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emberjs.com/blog/2013/03/22/stabilizing-ember-data.ht...</a><p>5: <a href=""https://github.com/emberjs/data/commits/master"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/emberjs/data/commits/master</a>",1365379238

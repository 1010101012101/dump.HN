3129898,comment,3128480,3129300,8,0,dmk23,,,"I take a very simple perspective on this ""single founder aversion"".<p>If some investor is going to ignore my traction and business just because I achieved it without signing on a token co-founder, then frankly it is their loss and I won't hesitate to politely tell them that. By definition getting to the same results without co-founders requires a much higher level of ability than if being part of a ""collective"". Any investor failing to recognize that is going to miss out some of the best deals and that is really their problem.<p>The main focus should be on pleasing customers and partners and if you do that right, eventually the right investors come along (with better terms too). Much better approach than to structure your company solely to please investors and forget what the business is all about.<p>You might even end up with a business making money and no investors to answer to (or at least investors not having significant control over you). What a terrible thing!<p>PS: Quite a few people promoted to ""co-founders"" should really be employees with accountability for specific tasks and projects, not an open-ended license to call the shots.",1319028985

No matter how many nasty words might be said, the code will still WORK!  That's a BIGGIE.  Can sleep well on it and maybe soon take it to the bank.<p>Second, the hacker has in his good code a great example of how to solve problems, an example that applies not universally but, still, significantly more generally.  So, one of the first ways the hacker knew his code was good was when he gave it a severe desk check.  There he went through the code as a 'logical path' that connected end to end.  Well, that's a GREAT 'problem solving paradigm', one of the very best of all!  So, apply that paradigm where can to some of the other issues in the startup.  E.g., a biggie is, will users and/or customers like it?  Well, if have a good solution for a big ass, hairy, stinking problem people are screaming to have solved and for which there is no good solution, then, sure, just found your 'end to end logical connection'.<p>The run out of cash worry?

Facebook has bases, and operates, in Europe.  Thus they MUST abide by our data laws.  This means that, under our European laws they MUST supply ALL information they have on people.  Currently this is not being done and as such they are breaking the law by not providing ALL information they hold on people.  If they want to have HQ's in Europe and want Europeans to use their service they must abide by our laws, this is regardless if we as a user decide to sign up or not. These laws cannot at anytime be waived REGARDLESS if it is indeed us as Europeans deciding to use their service.<p>2. Quite simply, if they offer the option of ""deleting"" posts/likes/mails, then they should do just that, delete it. Anything other than this and they are quite blatantly misleading users.<p>3.  They SHOULD NOT be gathering information on ANYONE who does not use their service.  This is not legal and should not be allowed to happen. The old saying ""knowledge is power"" comes to mind, but these ""big corporations"" should not be able to gather data on people who have no connection what-so-ever to their company/services.  Britain recently has been rocked by such scandals as phone hack etc aswell as the big argument about Google cars collecting data from wireless networks that they were not authorised to do so from.  Is facebook gather information on people who have no connection to them any different from hacking someones phone and listening to their messages? Or any different from a Google car passing your home and gathering information for your wireless network? My opinion is that it isnt any different.  New of the world have had to pay out massive amount of compensation to the people who could prove that their phones were hacked.  It is a breach of privacy and more importantly, THE LAW.  Google also had to agree to delete all information gathered by its Google cars as this was deemed to be illegally collected.<p>Facebook should be made to adhere to our laws if they wish to be present in our countries. Thus they should be made to supply ALL information held on people who make subject access requests, they should delete all e mails/post/likes that have been deleted by the original (or any recipicants) and should also delete ALL information they have gained about people who no longer/have never used their service.<p>I joined facebook when it first came out as would say i was pretty young and naive, I didnt read all the agreements etc and certainly didnt know what I was signing myself up for (alot of which has not came out until recently). If facebook want to use the argument that everyone who signs up agree to their t&c then they should respect the fact that only peoples over the age of 18 should be allowed to join in Europe. (this is currently not the case with children as young as 8 and their pet dogs having profiles)....<p>Facebook cant have it all their own way and must respect the laws of the land, PERIOD.",1319027264

That is, given how much Drew had already done, a cofounder had to be mostly just downside risk.  The 'mitigation' had to be minimal.<p>Or, Drew's left hand doesn't fight with his right hand, but cofounders can easily fight.<p>If a cofounder is really needed, then so be it.  But a cofounder is always risky, and a single founder who has already done well starting the business has a big advantage just because his left hand won't fight with his right hand.<p>Now a single founder can do much more than in past years, even just five years ago.<p>And here's a big point:  always in a startup very much want the CEO to 'understand his business'.  In an IT software startup, that includes understanding the software.  But software has now changed:  E.g., with .NET, nearly everything needed in commercial computing, and a larger fraction of Web site construction, is already in the .NET classes.  So, the work is just writing a little 'glue' code between the uses of the classes.  So, the coding goes VERY quickly.  But what doesn't go quickly is understanding the classes because need about 10 books each of 500-1000 pages and, even for just a Web site, about 3000 Web pages of documentation from MSDN.  And, this understanding of .NET is just 'overhead' that have to pay just once per programming task solved with a .NET class actually understand well.  So, to 'know his business', a CEO needs to know the relevant parts of, say, .NET.  A cofounder can't help here.  And once the CEO does have that .NET knowledge, there can be some serious question if a cofounder can add much.  Just what the Linux world has in place of .NET I don't know, but it can't be both small and effective.<p>There is other evidence:  Look up and down Main Street at the successful businesses that have been started there.  Typically there's only one person who is the real 'founder'.  Look at research:  Bright ideas come first to just one person at a time.  Period.  Microsoft:  A Bill Gates show.  Apple:  A Steve Jobs show.  Berkshire:  A Warren Buffett show.  Renaissance:  A James Simons show.  Continue with the one man shows of Kolmogorov, von Neumann, Knuth, etc. and in music Heifetz, Rostropovich, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, etc.<p>It's tough enough to find a Michelangelo to paint the ceiling.  Getting him a 'copainter' who would actually help would be impossible.  As you add people to a team, the team regresses to the mean where you don't want to be.  And, did I mention fights?

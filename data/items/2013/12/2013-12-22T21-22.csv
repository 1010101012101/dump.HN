It&#x27;s not hard to find high school students with a better grasp of this subject than this reporter, sadly.

I very much doubt we have the whole story here and I would prefer not to weigh in until all the information is out.  Other commentators on HN have noted that this was a nuclear carrier, so there should be proper records of their exposure (not to mention alternate routes of exposure...) which should be properly evaluated before rushing to judgement here, but there are simply too many possibilities to sensibly evaluate them all without more information.<p>For example, the article makes it sound like they were exposed to radioactive iodine (due to the thyroid conditions), something I would have expected the carrier to detect, and for which we have reasonable counter-measures (iodine pills).  I do not have any insight into what went wrong, but I would focus my investigation on their records of exposure, any treatments, etc.  My gut tells me that someone screwed up here, but we lack information sufficient to determine who, and everything is suspect.<p>That aside, radiation sickness is a terrible thing, and hope they are able to recover.",1387748549

You can pretty easily control the spacing and delta in the radius and theta, and then just use Bezier curves from there which should not have weird cusps that the author describes if your spacing is correct.  With a few modifiers (like using Manhattan distance for the radial measurement) you can make some variations like more &quot;square&quot; tracks although this would introduce (potentially) new complications.<p>That said, the author&#x27;s implementation works great regardless of complexity and would probably fair better with more complex track types.",1387748164

Reading between the lines they were paid for it, but they don&#x27;t even manage to come out and say that outright in this &quot;letter.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s always some level of faith involved in installing an early iOS jailbreak, because exploits often aren&#x27;t documented or open-sourced until long after their release (for a variety of reasons - vanity, ripoffs, weaponization, etc.). But at least most of the jailbreaks released in the past have been transparent and configurable.<p>In the Dev Team jailbreaks, all userland packages were optional and if a user wanted, they could uncheck the &quot;Install Cydia&quot; box in the payload configuration, configure their own Cydia (because the source is open, imagine that!), or install a completely different set of user-land applications. Plus a variety of parties with various interests in the development community were given previous jailbreaks early, which provides at least a cursory level of auditing and sign-off.

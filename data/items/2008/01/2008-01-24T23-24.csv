103844,comment,103802,103802,0,0,doubleplus,,,"my 2 cents on the strategy tip:<p>I'd turtle... Don't increase any of the 1's, move everything up one rank, then bounce pieces back and forth to the first rank, keeping each piece within 1 of at least two other pieces.  I might have to have a couple 2's on the edges.  That, or I'd try to restructure to a 3x5(+1) rather than a 2x8.  I'd eventually have to increase a few numbers and break the shell a little bit, but by then my opponent will have far fewer 1's and a much more unstable structure from his attacks on me.",1201218190

Very often = 50 %
Sometimes = 50 %<p>The other 30 or so (business associates):
Not often = 100%<p>Hope this helps.  And if it is any further help when you move to the facebook platform, I try not to install facebook apps I can't see the source of.  I know of several other people with this mentality; you may wish to publish source eventually to broaden your audience.  Just a thought.<p>Again, hope this helps! :)",1201217740
103840,comment,103592,103675,0,0,tx,,,"This does not make any sense: Mr. Kudlov, who wrote this article for NRO is replying to non-existing arguments. Gates <i>did not</i> favor non-free economies, therefore there is absolutely NO REASON to mention Cuba and North Korea. Moreover, Gates did not argue benefits of free markets, why bring in China, India and Eastern Europe? Gates merely says ""capitalism is great let's see if we can make it work better for the poor"". Gates isn't even <i>hinting</i> that it should be done at someone's expense. Basically Kidlov did not even care to read the original article.<p>Thus, after removing these obviously misplaced sentences and paragraphs, NRO's article basically turns into a lonely link to WSJ without any corresponding commentary.",1201217656

103838,story,,,6,3,dfranke,"As long as we're posting our chess-variants, here's mine",,"I invented this when I was in high school to play with friends during study hall.  It was fun.<p>1. The chess board is the real projective plane: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_plane .  So if a bishop is on h1 and moves forward and to the right, it comes out on a7 and would proceed to b6.  A rook that moves down from f1 comes out on c8 and proceeds to c7.<p>2. The board starts out empty.  Players begin with each of the eight non-pawn pieces in their ""inventory"".  A turn consists either of moving a piece or of placing a piece from your inventory.  You must place your king on the first turn.<p>3. All pieces except for pawns follow the same movement rules as in regular chess.  Pawns can move one space in any orthogonal direction or capture one space in any diagonal direction.<p>4. Whenever one of your pieces other than a pawn is captured, you get a pawn placed in your inventory.<p>5. If one of your pawns captures a piece, your pawn transforms into the piece it captured (but remains its own color).<p>6. The object of the game is to capture your opponent's king.",1201217585

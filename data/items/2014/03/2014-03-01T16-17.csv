If you can reach the point where practicing is fun, you&#x27;re much more likely to continue leveling up.<p>Adult learners typically find the first few hours of practicing a new skill extremely frustrating, and a very low percentage will complete even 2-3 hours of deliberate practice if the skill is complex, ambiguous, or challenging. Somewhere around hours 3-10, however, you start to see clear improvements, and pushing through frustration is much less of a factor. That&#x27;s the point where you start seeing clear results.<p>In my research/experience, the threshold for acquiring new skills for personal or professional use is somewhere around 20 hours. That&#x27;s not &quot;expertise&quot; - it&#x27;s being able to produce a desired result or enjoy the experience. In the vast majority of cases, you don&#x27;t need to be an &quot;expert&quot; to derive value from practicing new skills.<p>Since most people have a hard time pushing through the early frustration barrier, 10-20 hours of strategic, deliberate practice will also give you a surprising level of competence compared to other people. All it really takes is having a smart strategy that ensures (1) you invest those early hours of practice in acquiring the most commonly-used sub-skills, (2) you alter your environment to make it as easy as possible to remove distractions, sit down, and do the work.<p>[1] Book: <a href=""http://first20hours.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://first20hours.com</a><p>[2] Overview: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY</a>",1393692691

I know I&#x27;m actually stressed when my mind shuts down and is unable to process information and make good decisions (i.e. I start panicking).  I&#x27;ve experienced this in many different scenarios, from the time I was volunteering in high school for a big school performance event, the first time I was working a cash register and tried to return the correct change to a person, first big tech foul-up that majorly impacted a client, and various crisis-level incidents managing tech at the 2010 Olympics.<p>As I&#x27;ve gone through life and experienced more and more difficult things, I&#x27;ve realized that stress very relative.  But when I was experiencing those things <i>at the time for the first time</i>, they were very stressful.  When I look back at my high school self trying to find an extra chair for a ticket holder at that performance event, I find it absurd that I panicked so much.  Same for when I was trying to calculate the correct amount of change in my head for a retail customer.  Ludicrous.  But I can&#x27;t deny the stress I felt back then.<p>But as my experiences with stress became bigger, I realized something that changed the way I thought about things.  I was still alive, things were still happening.  So what if the Mexican consulate lost all of their visa records and applications because I did some shoddy sysadmin work?  Well, yeah, a very big number of people were impacted.  But I lived through it.  I was shellacked, but I lived through it.  Olympic crisis incidents?  I experienced several during both training scenarios and the real thing.  I was shellacked, but I lived through it.  And current startup stuff?  Well, nothing huge yet, but perhaps that&#x27;s only because I haven&#x27;t reached a level of success where I am exposed to that type of risk yet.<p>The point is that every time I experienced something bigger and survived, I realized that actually life goes on, and because I can survive, I am quite capable of handling whatever life throws at me.  With that perspective, basically I have learned to <i>have</i> perspective.  Realize that whatever I may be experiencing right now, no matter how difficult and stressful it may be, there will be a tomorrow.  Even if I am reduced to absolutely nothing and lose <i>everything</i>, I still would be alive and would be able to start again.<p>And that perspective suddenly makes it easy to deal with all the crappy stressful stuff that may come by.  At the end of the day, they&#x27;re all just small things that don&#x27;t kill me.  I hope that if I ever experience something truly terrible, like a fight with terminal cancer, I can keep the same perspective.  Whatever, I am still alive, and I can go on.",1393692261

That doesn&#x27;t actually mean it has a negative ROI, because the sustainability program is good PR. It builds goodwill that spurs purchases and evangelism. And Apple needs good PR following all that business with the Chinese factory working conditions.<p>So now here&#x27;s the trouble.

You have to give the line about how you run a corporation with a conscience blah blah blah, because that&#x27;s the line that keeps the yuppies buying Apple hardware. If you come out and say the whole sustainability initiative is to convince Green party voters to buy iPhones made in a city with soupy air in a factory with suicide nets by workers who never leave company property, or downplay the amount of money it costs you to do it, the Green party voters will hear that and not buy as many gadgets from you.

And try to split Ukraine along language-ethnic lines and destroy it as an independent state as a punishment for defying them. Note that any success of new Ukrainian powers spells trouble for Putin, as it means one can defeat the authoritarian rulers and succeed, while the official position is that the authoritarian rule is the only defense against chaos. So Putin would be very invested in causing the said chaos in Ukraine, both as a revenge, as means of control and to support the idea that his rule must be strong - otherwise see what happened to Ukrainians.

7324765,comment,7324039,7324039,1,0,Dewie,,,"&quot;Self help&quot; is a vague term, but they tend to be rooted more in New Age concepts than in Western monotheism. New Age concepts tend in turn to be linked to Eastern religions or spiritual practices. So no, I don&#x27;t think that self help books have filled the void of Western religions. It might be only in the existential questions that they answer, but then again, the Buddhist idea of an &quot;afterlife&quot; is very different from the typical Christian one, and has a very different appeal.<p>(I think that this is more of a Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy kind of thing. But oh well.)<p>Perhaps the typical self help consumer is too wide-eyed and expects too much of life. It might also be that they are turning to un-scholarly, unlicensed authors because no established science or human institution has been able to give them the kind kind of knowledge that they want. In such a case, these psychologists in this article might be wise to think of their professions monumental failure to inspire confidence in the general population. If psychology had found results that were relevant to the common person, I expect them to have been incorporated into the common vocabulary. Instead, psychology is not associated with anything that a <i>healthy</i> person might be in need of; only the &#x27;crazy people&#x27;. Of course these psychologists think that self help is too optimistic, when the field has historically been so pre occupied with illness (how old is &#x27;positive psychology&#x27;, again...?).<p>We might know how a good life is lead, but there is no authority, currently, on <i>how</i> to achieve it (taking into account human motivation and all that). Some will turn to bestselling authors because, really, having sold a lot of books is about as good of a mark of quality in this field at this point. Then perhaps start to proclaim that we are all ONE, because <i>quantum physics</i>. What these might have in common with the archetypical religious person is wishful thinking.<p>These people should consider just giving up on this whole self help thing, anyway, as there are simpler alternatives. Our understanding of the world - at least the world outside of ourselves - is so well understood that we can use this as a sleeping pillow. Gone are the days when a rationally inclined mind would have to also be a philosopher, in order to fill in the gaps where the obvious models of the world don&#x27;t make sense. Now, you can just &#x27;like&#x27; &quot;I fucking love science&#x27; on Facebook, make the occasional off-hand joke about homoeopathy, and you&#x27;re safely in the in-crowd of modern, pseudo intellectual rationalists. &quot;If I can&#x27;t see it, I don&#x27;t believe it&quot; is as simple as &quot;If there is no study about it, I don&#x27;t believe it&quot;.

I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the case that there is no way to keep a government in check.<p>Tell that to the people of <i>every tyrannical regime in the history of mankind</i>. Perhaps they were just doing it wrong?<p>> Also, I don&#x27;t think &quot;someone else [having] the right to rule [us]&quot; is a correct characterization of functioning democratic governance (even in a representative democracy).<p>How would you characterize it then?<p>> You have shown neither that the above is sound reasoning, nor that other frameworks are not.<p>What reasoning and &quot;other frameworks&quot; might you be referring to?<p>> And if 100 people decide I don&#x27;t have a right to a spleen in a context without government, how does that go any better?<p>How is that relevant to what I said?<p>> But my point was deeper. One of the consequences of prohibition (of alcohol or drugs) was to remove government as a means of settling disputes for a group of people handling relatively large sums of money.<p>Why not say something like that then? :p Disregarding whether you&#x27;ve described a real problem, you seem to be suggesting that a government&#x27;s decision caused a big problem, and therefore, government is.. good?<p>> Yes, precisely. And much like any technology it can be misused, poorly designed, poorly configured; and this can lead to frustration or harm.<p>This is just way out there.. :p  But tell me, how exactly is government a &quot;technology&quot;, how should it be &quot;used&quot;, and why didn&#x27;t we do so? :P<p>> Once again, that&#x27;s not true. In a functioning democracy, governments are responsible to the people lest the groups with power lose it.<p>Well, &quot;luckily&quot; the <i>real power</i> is not with rank-and-file politicians that indeed do come and go: <a href=""http://charleshughsmith.blogspot.fi/2014/02/the-dollar-and-deep-state.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://charleshughsmith.blogspot.fi/2014/02/the-dollar-and-d...</a><p>> In any system, the possibility of revolution serves as a partial check.<p>Again, I&#x27;d point to every single tyrannical regime ever. That &quot;partial check&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to be working too well.<p>Look, ultimately it&#x27;s about how much abuse the general populace is willing to take.. before it&#x27;s too late to do anything (see: North-Korea, USSR, etc).<p>Once there&#x27;s a small group of &quot;people&quot; wielding power over everyone else, the people are guaranteed to end up suffering sooner or later. The ruling class keeps expanding and looting everyone else harder and harder, until you&#x27;re.. say, in the US in 2014.<p>The US provides a prime example of what follows from a minimal, &quot;Constitutional&quot; government.<p>> Governments are also responsible to other governments, in some extreme situations.<p>Sooo.. War, or something? Well, maybe ordinary Canadians will rescue ordinary Americans from their government? :p  &quot;We must give America the blessing of Democracy! Now go forth and kill or be killed!&quot; --> &quot;Sir! Yes! Sir!&quot;<p>> I&#x27;m not sure where you derive this ranking in which government is highest, or why only lower powers can be kept in check.<p><i>&quot;Every Communist must grasp the truth: Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.&quot;</i> - Mao.<p>I&#x27;m sure you know how it works.<p>> Not always; when it&#x27;s not, things suck even more; see, for instance, many parts of Somalia.<p>Again, it&#x27;s all about the attitude of the general populace. If people accept that there&#x27;s a ruling class bossing them around - even if it&#x27;s a small one - it will grow and gain more and more power. The only limit to a government&#x27;s growth is the attitude of its subjects.<p>The government fosters dependence on itself, through various social programs, health care, pensions and so on. Through the education system, the government conditions people into thinking it&#x27;s absolutely necessary and beneficial, and through controlling the money supply, the government loosens the limits on how much money it can spend.<p>And here we are. Look at what the US has become. Note how the whole Western world&#x27;s economies are going down the toilet too, and note how mass surveillance is spreading everywhere.<p>> Revolution is horrible, yes.<p>Yeah, and the thing is, without governments, there would be no revolutions! It&#x27;s like, countless deaths could be avoided!<p>> I don&#x27;t think &quot;group of sociopaths in power hurting everyone&quot; is a legitimate description of all government.<p>Would you settle for &quot;looting everyone&quot; then?

When I first got into OSM, I did what lots of people do: I filled in a bunch of details I know about where I grew up. Kind of fun. Well a month or so later, I checked out Google maps and, lo and behold, their data was much better for that little town. It was NOT the OSM edits I made--they didn&#x27;t steal anything. But I found it odd that they&#x27;d all of a sudden take interest in a little town of less than 1500 people in the middle of nowhere. I don&#x27;t know. It could have been a coincidence--It&#x27;s possible they had a big world-wide map update during that month that updated everything.<p>Oh, and it RAISES the question, not &quot;begs&quot; the question.",1393689763

Same with demand - not having a college degree puts you on a lower track that&#x27;s almost impossible to break out of, and the connections, etc. mean that MOOC&#x27;s aren&#x27;t a good substitute for undergraduate education, while the professions all require specialized schooling afterwards.<p>So where does all the money go?

Failing with a start up is when you get some stability back as you go and get a regular job.<p>The US is where there is more incentive to quit early as it will restore your health insurance and other benefits. In the EU the difference between failing startup/government support and regular job is smaller, so the incentive to fold is lower.<p>If anything the Euopean system could cause you to hang on to a no hope case for too long as you can make ends meet more easilly.",1213030783

For instance, are you thinking of a social network, a social messaging system like IM, email or twitter, or 3D web gaming.  You see, I think if what you are thinking of is easier done in other lingos I would say save yourself the java headaches and use php or python or <insert dynamic lingo here>.

I of course don't mean this to extend to anyone in this thread. Imagine, though, giving your average PHP or ASP developer, who may struggle to implement a basic sort algorithm, the problem of implementing cooperative multitasking in a scalable way.<p>> Do you know of any examples of ultra highly scalable fork()ing servers?<p>Under real-world workloads, I still consider Apache to be ""highly scalable.""

In the past, a lot of people were aiming to become officials but in order to do so they had to take these standardized tests that required years of preparation and memorization where you would have to read and memorize text from old thinkers.<p>But by going through this entire process of memorization/studying one would start to think like them and not come up with any original ideas. Maybe parts of this are still around today and are focusing more on memorization rather than on creativity.<p>As an aside, another reason I thought of would be the Communist state would hinder thinking for oneself and stifle creativity that way. Why I dismissed it was that the Soviet Union had an equally oppressive regime yet they were able to compete with the US during the Cold War just fine for a few decades.<p>I'll glady take criticism of my ideas; very curious as to what others think.",1213028522

Basically everyone hated it.<p>Perhaps there was just a curriculum failure, or perhaps teachers weren&#x27;t well-equipped enough to teach the material. But we can&#x27;t ignore the attempt and need to come up with an answer for why New Math failed before we can try it again.",1445799598
10447902,comment,10446603,10447877,0,0,rdtsc,,,"> Are evangelicals really easy to brainwash?<p>Yes they are. They are in a way pre-brainwashed by their leaders so using just the right rhetoric you can get them to act as a block and get them to do your bidding. They also have a nice property that they congregate in large megachurches, you really just have to convince the pastor to preach your agenda, and you instantly got thousands of voters.<p>Here is an excerpt from the link:<p>&quot;President Bush made his famous comment that his favorite political philosopher was Jesus Christ because he changes your heart, I was a little bit surprised by that. Surprised, because presidential candidates usually do not make specific sectarian references to their beliefs. …&quot;<p>Note, Bush Jr wasn&#x27;t the only one who realized and exploited the potential. The AIPAC (Pro Israel Lobby) is also using Evangelicals.<p><a href=""http://www.aipac.org/connect/communities/yourchurch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aipac.org/connect/communities/yourchurch</a><p>^ The strategy is pretty clear. Identify pastors of megachurges and cater to them.<p>Here is an excerpt from AIPAC&#x27;s mission page:<p>&quot;Pastors and other significant community leaders have amplified their voices by inviting elected officials to speak about the U.S.-Israel relationship in church, organizing parlor meetings with members of Congress to lobby them on pro-Israel legislation and participating in AIPAC’s annual Policy Conference.&quot;<p>I have seen the effect first hand, it was very effective. An elderly relative was a member in one of those churches. Maybe 20-15 years ago they couldn&#x27;t show you where Middle East was on the map. And all of the sudden within 5 years they somehow started talking about supporting the state Isreal and their house filled with trinkets built by settlers as &quot;thank you&quot;s from thousands in donations she sent over there and so on. It was a bit baffling, at first. Then I watched one the sermons by her pastor once (she had a recording) and it become clear what&#x27;s happening.",1445799595

Then guessing might be discouraged.<p>Another reason could be that maybe teachers believe that a student somehow knows the answer subconsciously and just guessing will tease that out. Or not trying to guess, means they have given up and are not engaged.

By definition, you must not have a lot of pre-existing Rust code. :)<p>Many of these sorts of things are hell to retrofit on to existing code, but if you integrate them into your workflow early, just shy of free over time to use all along. It&#x27;s &quot;just shy of free&quot; because the tools themselves train you over time so that you get to the point where you start with conforming code, and the tools are just cleaning up occasional slips rather than requiring you to rewrite everything.

I just phrased it in a manner that gives teachers agency.<p>No, you were making a blanket statement about an entire profession. Saying that people react poorly under prolonged stress is a simple statement of fact, with decades of concurring evidence from fields ranging from business and education to neuroscience, and it doesn&#x27;t imply that those people chose to do anything wrong other than being an average human in a bad situation.<p>In contrast, your statement shifted all of the blame to one of the parties with the least agency and used loaded terms like “unprofessional” or “horrible” without any supporting justification.<p>> Black history was also an example taken from smelendez. History of any sort is far less important than literacy and numeracy, as is comparative religion, evolution, art and music (his other examples).<p>There were quite a few other things which he included which are not 3Rs and I find it interesting that you picked the only one which is the hobby-horse of right-wing discussion about schools.<p>> But I guess calling me racist is easier than actually addressing my arguments.<p>That&#x27;s why I said “casual, unthinking racism” because there are so many tropes common to popular U.S. discussion which are rooted in racism but often propagated by people who haven&#x27;t thought deeply about the origin or implications.",1445798358

It&#x27;s alarming when I see all the chubby faces around me painstakingly eating their salad and going to the gym but not having the slightest clue of nutrition.<p>It&#x27;s not about eating less calories or eating low-fat. Or fruits or vegan. Or doing more exercise. It&#x27;s always about carbs--avoiding carbs is the key. The most common education gaps:<p>1. Carbs are like crack, the more you eat the more you thrive for them, you think you are hungry but you aren&#x27;t. And this is the no 1 reason that most cannot stop their obesity, they are hooked on carbs. Just go to the next supermarket and check which products have the biggest shelf space: those which have addictive ingredients, booze and sweets.<p>2. You have to heavily compensate carbs with protein and fat when you do low carb/keto. Eg, if I go below 70g carbs a day, I need 70g protein and 130g (!) fat a day to compensate the lower carbs intake. If you are not doing so you become hungry. Most think that fat is bad and makes you obese, what a fallacy. As long you keep you carb intake low you can consume tons of fat and you will stay forever slim. Actually it is rather a problem to get that amounts of fat in mainstream food. With protein it&#x27;s even worse and more expensive.<p>3. The older you get the harder your body can handle carbs. People think it&#x27;s normal that they get a belly at some point and they can&#x27;t do anything about it. Your metabolism changes over the years and you have just to learn to manage carbs. You cannot totally avoid carbs, you still need them but know how to control the volume.<p>As the parent wrote, go to Reddit&#x27;s Keto sub, probably the most advanced keto/low carb group. And it&#x27;s not a niche diet.<p>Besides, I also found that when I am on carbs I am ultra ADD not able to focus on anything.<p>EDIT: Thanks for the downvote, I would love to know why",1445797915

So, the by-hand nature of these passwords seems like an advantage, all else being equal. Right?<p>If /dev/urandom is seededed/used properly, then it will be good enough for passwords. The by-hand method is also good if your dice are fair.<p>> + I thought real words were really bad in a password. Is the idea here that, with six words from these lists, the possible combinations are so great that the trade off is worth it because the password is memorable? That seems suspicious to me because you&#x27;re essentially giving the cracker the list of possible passwords. Though that list may be quite long, it&#x27;s still a list. Right?<p>Well, by using only characters (and under a certain length, say 100 chars), you already have a list, so whatever you do, there is a finite\nnumber of valid passwords.\nThe 6-word strategy is actually quite good. (I use this method for some passwords).<p>The Arch Linux /usr/share/dict/british has 123398 words.<p>123398 ^ 6 = 3530601691883345409045950707264 possible passwords<p>log(3530601691883345409045950707264) / log(2) is about 101.5 bits of randomness.<p>Given 86 possible characters and a 14 character password (which you may not be able to remember), there are 1210537694726365245693116416 possibilities, which gives about 90 bits of randomness.<p>> + These can&#x27;t be better than the 30 character passwords I generate with 1Password, right? Unless there&#x27;s a bug in 1Password... Maybe that&#x27;s part of the point.<p>Randomly generated passwords using all characters have a fatal flaw: one cannot easily remember them. If they&#x27;re just being saved in a password manager, they are good, but you probably want a master password that you can remember, which is a good use case for these.",1445796419

It&#x27;s rather difficult to individually consider the human benefit to welfare programs when congressmen/women with ties to defense-industry districts can just as easily make an argument for the jobs and wages paid to the working class because of those programs.<p>I think this is why (very much conjecture-ing here) there seems to be a groundswell of support for the idea of guaranteed income. If you can solve some of the individual woes people have collectively by giving everyone a basic income, it&#x27;s easier to argue for and against government spending for individual programs, because far fewer will be able to have such a socially destructive effect if they are cancelled.<p>Just a thought.",1445796405

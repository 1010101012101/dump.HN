I didn&#x27;t have any grand dreams about being a 20-something entrepreneur, I just came to the (accurate, as it turns out) conclusion that it was never going to be easier to completely upend my personal and professional life than it was when I was 23 - no mortgage, no SO, no debt other than student loans, no kids, etc.<p>When we got acquired, I assumed that I would leave as soon as I could and do it all again - but yet, I&#x27;m still here.  It&#x27;s interesting work, and while I miss the ability to just get things done, I find that I&#x27;ve been getting a lot better at dealing with problems at scale.  So, for example, how DO you launch a new product to a sales and support organization with hundreds of people?<p>I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;ll never start a company again, because I really want to, but I&#x27;m enjoying feeling like I&#x27;m learning how to do things better next time.",1408024760

8177468,comment,8177259,8177259,4,0,stygiansonic,,,"You might have Imposter Syndrome.  Take a step back, and make a list of all your accomplishments. This is not about being self-centered, it&#x27;s about taking a honest view of your life. During the day-to-day shuffle, with short-term deadlines and other obligations, it&#x27;s easy to forget about the long path you&#x27;ve taken to get to where you are.<p>You co-founded a company that was acquired - how many people can say that? Even if it was an acqui-hire, does that really make a difference? Why do you feel that this accomplishment is not worthy of praise?<p>You didn&#x27;t like working at the parent company and so you left to find different work. What is wrong with that? I would bet that most people on HN have been through a similar circumstance. If you don&#x27;t like working at a certain place and don&#x27;t fit it, it&#x27;s not necessarily your fault or anyone&#x27;s &quot;fault&quot;.<p>Furthermore, you had the ability and confidence to leave a job you did not like and take a job that perhaps will be a better fit. Why does it matter that it&#x27;s not in a &quot;sexy&quot; or &quot;trendy&quot; industry? Reading just the big headline stories on HN or other tech websites will leave you a bubble where it seems like everyone is working for an ultra-trendy hipster startup that will be &quot;the next big thing&quot;, when in reality many software developers work in more mundane industries but are still very technically astute and have a fulfilling life.<p>If it&#x27;s something you can do day after day and it doesn&#x27;t bother you, in my mind that is great. Don&#x27;t compare yourself to what others want, compare yourself to what you want.<p>Which leads me to my next point: Why do you believe that you are an underachiever? Compared to what benchmark? There is nothing wrong with being ambitious - motivation often provides the drive to succeed.  But if you are always left wanting more, then you never really get to savour the reward from your efforts and hard work.<p>Take a step back and try to figure out what really fulfills you in life. Work is often treated as a means to an end, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong that. However, some people really do relish work and for them, that is an end in an unto itself. But if that&#x27;s not what fulfills you, you shouldn&#x27;t try to pigeon-hole yourself into someone else&#x27;s goals by way of comparison.",1408024660

If it doesn&#x27;t that&#x27;s not a mark against the Uber-like, it&#x27;s a mark against the city. People do not want one app per city or country, but one which works everywhere.

If that&#x27;s correct, you&#x27;re going to have a tremendously hard time getting this off the ground.<p>Why don&#x27;t you just focus on the travel bloggers side to begin with?

I&#x27;ve seen those crude TCP stack implementations and those are barely LAN capable. Using those over Internet wouldn&#x27;t be a great idea. Often these TCP stacks are used just as serial - tcp converters. Using RWIN of 16 (max) bytes due UART buffering limits etc. Not sending ACK before whole 16 byte is cleared and so on.<p>So with really low end devices, it&#x27;s better to off load TCP to custom hardware. Many embedded devices use that approach. In such cases you&#x27;ll only call to IP address and port, and when it connects, you&#x27;ll have your TCP/IP connection in pure serial. TCP-modems isn&#x27;t any different from other good old Hayes modems. It&#x27;s just dial-up over Internet and TCP.<p>Btw. If the system is able to run CPython, Linux, or something similar, it&#x27;s already a pretty powerful system.",1408024489

The shiny app does a lot to make the experience better, pays for the service (don&#x27;t need to tip either!), tracks your driver, gives you contact information and a name/picture, as well as let you split fares between the passengers automatically, etc etc. That combined with surge pricing and the crowd sourcing nature (uber is often the only service any place but downtown or the airport) makes for a better product, safety concerns aside.",1408024467

I don&#x27;t think that the process described in the article necessarily facilitates the possibility of &quot;better art&quot;.<p>On a technical level, the possibly increased resolution and color depth that can be achieved using this method will certainly impose less limitations on the artist in exactly those terms, but in my opinion that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that they will make it easier to produce good art.",1408024421

There are not instructions, and I can&#x27;t tell after playing a few rounds.<p>3) I would recommend giving your contact info either in the app description or on your webpage. If I can&#x27;t find contact info then I am likely to complain about bugs via an app review because that is the only method you gave me.<p>4) Please give some visual feedback for which kernel is about to pop. Some are different colors, but there is no apparent reason as they are all the same type.<p>5) You only see the opening menu the first time you play the game. There is no way to get back to the menu after a round only a exit button which exited the whole app. That is possibly a bug and it just crashed.<p>6) After one of the rounds I didn&#x27;t get any menu and had to force quit the app to play again.<p>7) If you exit the game (ie. with the home button) it does not stop the clock, and then it shows a large time when you resume and finish the round.<p>8) The splash screen flashes up for a fraction of a second.

But what have you got to lose? At age 25, you can live a scrappy life, there&#x27;s no social pressure not be a salary man anymore these days, especially in a startup scene where it&#x27;s so normal. You&#x27;re young and can take the risk.<p>* Third, the only point that really matters in my opinion, is the people you have to provide for. If there&#x27;s no way around it, there&#x27;s no way around it. I know what that&#x27;s like and I respect that. Just make sure to check your assumtions carefully. I&#x27;d had to take care of my sick dad for a long time, but wouldn&#x27;t throw away an opportunity I really believed in, as he&#x27;d hate himself if he was an obstacle, and he&#x27;d still have my mom and my bro, and I&#x27;d still be able to support him partially. Talk to those who you support, and consider if they really depend on you. Sometimes there&#x27;s room to juggle both, sometimes it&#x27;s possible to find an alternative caretaker.<p>Lastly, there&#x27;s quite a few startups that are challenging and do pay decently from the get go. Bitcoin is a fun space for example, and Bitpay and Coinbase pay well, yet exist in a challenging and ever in-flux ecosystem.",1408023763

That date is approaching, and when it gets here, you are either going to fail or succeed, and the difference will likely be what you spend your time on right now.&quot;<p>This is moderately successful for important tasks with important consequences, but not so helpful when I really should, say, do my laundry.

It involves either complex or clever solutions, and to field a reliable product there must be relay fallback for the percentage of users who cannot traverse.

Like I said, I have a system in the field now seeing 90-95% success rate with direct connectivity. No firewall config is needed, nor are users conscripted to act as relays.<p>Like I said elsewhere on the thread: coping with the limitations of mobile is harder than dealing with NAT.

As for commercial drivers, they do much more millage and as such it is much more likely, that something happens.<p>For (1): a commercially driven vehicle makes much more millage, as such it is required to visit inspection every year, while for regular vehicle in Germany it is only every other year.<p>For (2): drivers with a commercial license to drive people around are required to have regular medical check-ups. Also wrong behaving while driving is judged much hard, mostly twice the amount and double the points. That means, they can easily loose their license. That way, there should be a commercial pressure on them to drive safely.<p>By the way, Uber does not compete only with Taxi service. Their drivers don&#x27;t need a taxi license at all. Because, in Germany there are besides of Taxi additional licenses for such business. The are a number of such services, that operate within legal bounds since tens of years. The only difference between the &quot;cool&quot; start-up Uber is, that those have no shiny App and you have to know there phone numbers. That said, there are also services, which have an App, like <a href=""http://www.mydriver.de/fahrdienst/berlin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mydriver.de/fahrdienst/berlin</a><p>The main problem besides safety is also, that Uber promotes and supports moonlighting/illegal work. Because their argument is, that they provide only ride sharing. BUT, if that whould be true, then why promote a new ride sharing service called UberPool? If Uber would provide real ride sharing, as they argue, then they would only start UberPool and not UberX and UberPop.<p>But with UberPool there is the problem for them, they will compete with lots of other ride sharing companies, which operate in Germany since years and which are well established, like Blablacar, Flinc and others.<p>TL/DR: If Uber would operate within the well established business practices and requirements, nobody would complain. But they don&#x27;t want, because they want to be cheap on the back of actively ignoring all requirements.",1408023207

If your law is enacted you&#x27;ve just doomed a non negligible portion of the population to poverty.<p>As a European what that says to me is that the minimum wage is too low and should be increased.<p>And equally there are people today who have to desperately hope that they get assigned enough hours this month to get out of poverty.

You believe that you are good at what you do and are meant for great things but you have to do your job even though it doesn&#x27;t do justice to your capabilities. How do you cope with that? Seeing your future as an underachiever pains you. What do you do?<p>In the course of trying to figure it out, I spoke to my friends about this,  I realised that most of them are going through the same thing. But they haven&#x27;t figured out how to deal with it. I don&#x27;t know if this is what they call a quarter-life crisis.<p>Thus, this is as much a distress call as it is a rant. And not having anyone else to turn to, I am posting it here at HN assuming that this is not just a problem for a handful of people but a general problem for people who believe in their ability to do great things (whether it is true or not is irrelevant to them).<p>The questions I posed here aren&#x27;t the only ones I have in my mind. But, I hope I have been able to convey the message. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks!",1408022425

As an example: every apartment is required by law to provide a certain amount of natural light. You literally cannot offer an apartment without windows, nor with windows that lead into a wall.<p>And you could say, like I did, &quot;but what if I want to live in a windowless apartment because it&#x27;s cheaper?&quot;. The German answer to that is &quot;No, every person deserves decent living conditions, so you are not allowed to offer something that is not decent, <i>even if there is people willing to pay for it</i>&quot;. That&#x27;s the German way of doing things, and germans seem pretty happy about it.<p>Of course, this line of reasoning wouldn&#x27;t fly in the States. I think Uber failed to understand that the German government will not allow a service that does not meet the approved standards, <i>even if there&#x27;s people willing to pay for it</i>, because as a German citizen you are entitled to (and implicitly expect) a certain quality of service (insurance, availability) that Uber is not providing.",1408022269

Manage your co-workers expectations that you won&#x27;t be replying when you aren&#x27;t on the clock, don&#x27;t work for a boss that has the expectation that you are functionally on-call at times when you should be with your family and friends.<p>bad etiquette, i.e. stop sending so much email yourself and stop responding to email that doesn&#x27;t merit a response. OOO messages and other auto-responders are vile and just add to the mess - calendar requests, project updates, FYIs, CC&quot;s, etc. Most of this messaging traffic is just unnecessary and only adds to the weight of one&#x27;s inbox without making much of a contribution. Deal with your messaging in your app - turn off the notifications and update options and actually log into your calendar once or twice a day to view requests. Same goes for the rest of your web apps (I&#x27;m thinking of project and task tools like Asana, et al).<p>bad culture, i.e. be part of the solution, tell people when their email practices are dysfunctional. We have this thing at our office where staff will send out an email to 10 people asking &quot;when is a good time to get together?&quot; which triggers an avalanche of 25 messages all with conflicting instructions and requests about what might be the best time. I actively ask people to use my calendar and ignore the rest of the email on the subject. People are slowly starting to use my calendar for this sort of thing. Same goes for after-hours email. If you don&#x27;t want people to think you&#x27;ll respond after-hours, don&#x27;t send email after hours! In the most extreme cases, if you can&#x27;t change culture, then find a better place to work. Life is too short.<p>Corporate policy along the lines of &quot;delete email while you are on vacation&quot; just serve to reinforce all of these other bad practices.

Some feedback from me.<p>1) When I type in the city name in the search box, I can hit return to make selection, I have to click on the city in the drop down menu.<p>2) missing search box on the front page.<p>3)I type in France, and it says nothing matched my search. I would have expected that Paris would be shown.<p>4) I like that you are using OpenStreetMap instead of Google&#x27;s or Microsoft&#x27;s map products.",1408021496

(If not physical, then at least psychological as a form of intimidation or similar) Therefore, the violent reactions are justified, also if they are more violent than past ones.",1408021480

8177197,comment,8173170,8173170,3,0,guidedlight,,,"Okay, I was just reading through the landing page. Here are my thoughts:<p>* I&#x27;m not sure that &#x27;self hosted&#x27; needs to be mentioned in the heading. You don&#x27;t mention cloud or SaaS anywhere and have a big &#x27;download&#x27; button so it should be obvious without stating it.<p>* &quot;92five app covers all the basic project management features&quot;. Don&#x27;t say your product is basic, the features should rock.<p>* Responsive. Yawn. Most managers don&#x27;t know what this means. You don&#x27;t mention &#x27;mobile&#x27; anywhere in this section.<p>* Built with. This is the stuff you&#x27;re interested in, and it&#x27;s important but it has nothing to do with the product. Most users wouldn&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s PHP, Java or Basic.<p>* Screenshots. Great we are past the techie bits and back to the actual product... But I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m looking at.<p>* Wow, it&#x27;s free! That&#x27;s the best part and you mentioned it last... and in the FAQ. This should be up the top of the page!<p>I hope this helps.",1408021328

8177192,comment,8177107,8177107,3,0,forca,,,"I agree with deleting the emails. The US is woefully behind Europe in this regard. I would like to see a French-style work week, with the added goodness of France&#x27;s recent email/phone call law forbidding employers from contacting employees after a certain time.<p>I would like, at the very least, to see a federal law forbidding more than 40 hours max. The world has really deteriorated in regard to family life since the 80s. When everything started becoming 24-7, that&#x27;s when the decline began. I remember the sanity of the 80s whilst living in a couple of countries in western Europe at the time. The pace of life was better, more family time, the fun challenge of getting a popular restaurant reservation before they closed at a sane hour. It wasn&#x27;t all about profit then like it is now.<p>I make it clear to my current employer that I don&#x27;t do nights and weekends. When I leave the office at 1700, I&#x27;m unemployed. My wife and children come first.",1408021272

But then we started to use some dart conventions and the code shrink. The compiled version is still bigger than compiled js though, but for me the real benefit here is the structure of the code - it is getting more and more manageble. The app is very close to ExtJS (custom windows like app)",1408021260

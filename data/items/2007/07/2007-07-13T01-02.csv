33954,comment,33886,33942,0,0,Alex3917,,,"So I heard this talk at the Cornell Microsoft International Symposium on Self-Organizing Online Communities. The presentation was called ""Implications for Future Research; Theory and Methods in Large Scale Analysis of Online Communities."" And the three Yahoo presenters were Ravi Kumar, Andrew Tomkins, and Cameron Marlow. Not sure which one those three specifically, but I'm sure you could ask any of them. <p>I've developed this hobby of sneaking into academic conferences. It works best if when everyone else is wearing a suit and tie, you show up in shorts and a t-shirt. That way everyone just assumes that you're friends with one of the speakers, or else that you're Sergei Brin. :-)",1184291839

Their standard production model seems to be: slap a bunch of features together so that the user gets at least an hour or so of non-crash functionality, then spend years slowly resolving the bugs, yet pile on more features with more bugs, repeat.",1184291671
33952,comment,33886,33911,0,0,Jd,,,"Just thinking off the cuff here, but couldn't one store a lisp-style list as a string in a relational database.  If I was using Ruby on Rails, I could simply build a simple lisp interpreter in Ruby to parse the string, then capture it as an in-memory tree.  This way I would only have active items in memory and could use some of the advantages of the standard web development platforms for whatever else I was doing.<p>Edit: See Ruby/Lisp for one such already built interpreter.<p>",1184291655

I think the politicians know exactly what they are doing.  In regulating big business, they force big business to come to them for ""favors"" which they are more than happy to hand out for a price.",1184291489

33949,comment,33919,33938,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Actually, this is a really good logo idea.  Instead of trying to do to much, simplify.  You could have maybe 2 post-its together with ""study"" on one and ""stickies"" on the other, and drop the book.  Have the two out of alignment too, of course. <p>You could take it even further and treat the two words as if they were writing on different post-its with different looks :)",1184291048

Instead it asks us to feign confusion why bitfuck didn't become a mainstream language. Maybe because it was a bitfucking joke from the start?",1184289571

If there is a person/persons at Yahoo to contact I would do it, as this is something I have thought about quite a bit and would love to see more about the definitions of core, light, new, long-time, large and small.<p>You can email me if you like.",1184288991

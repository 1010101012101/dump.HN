6612367,comment,6611289,6612194,6,0,theOnliest,,,"> Do we really need more papers on Ancient History, or should we invest the same money in better teaching?<p>This seems to me like a pretty dim view of the humanities in general. Research in the humanities is not in the same category as research in Computer Science, for example; there is often little to no free-market value. People who enter the humanities tend to do so (at least in my experience) because knowledge for the sake of knowledge is something worth pursuing. Your next company might not make a fortune knowing more about agricultural practices of the ancient Macedonians, or the concept of fatherhood in the music of Robert Schumann, but people doing that research aren&#x27;t doing it simply &quot;to advance their career,&quot; and not necessarily just to teach new people how to research either.<p>It has traditionally been the function of universities to foster this sort of research, as a general goal of &quot;making the world a better, more knowledgeable place.&quot; It&#x27;s a societal goal that goes way back: people say that humanity was set back something like 1000 years when the library at Alexandria burned down. This type of research doesn&#x27;t fit neatly into any of your categories, and it is (I think) a more trenchant problem. Disillusioned humanities PhD&#x27;s often have problems finding work in the &quot;real world,&quot; since companies aren&#x27;t keen on hiring someone who knows everything there is to know about Macedonian agriculture.<p>-- a fairly disillusioned Ph.D. student in Music Theory",1382716719

Too much faff to do it in TFS.  The glue code for this is truly horrific, I&#x27;m thinking of buying ranerex.<p>I&#x27;ve not yet linked it up to the build quality (which I want to do) and I&#x27;m also thinking of making a more Windows Focused Chaos Monkey OS project.  I dislike the idea of testing only that a VM stops.  I want to see what happens if I hammer say its CPU with a few higher priority threads.  Or simulate insane network latency, or some other networking quirk.<p>I worry I am only testing against very well behaved nodes disappearance.<p>Ultimately I&#x27;ll have a nice little dashboard, which allows me to switch instance between UAT2/PROD, that shows me the available reserve for each environment.  I&#x27;m toying with making some OWIN extension that allows me to control which components are loaded.  For example, we have a &#x27;chat&#x27; component, which is obviously not essential.  I&#x27;d love the idea of automatically failing that.  As we add more value add features, certain models and the like which are CPU demanding, these features will not have any uptime guarantee, so I&#x27;d like to automatically throttle them, in the case of a catastrophic failure (like a DC loosing connectivity).<p>I am looking for something 99.999%.

6612344,comment,6610593,6610593,7,0,jroseattle,,,"I always find the most interesting aspect of &quot;we changed from X to Y&quot; to be about why change is happening, how it is managed, etc. Context is everything, but the process described by the OP sounds like standard, top-down decision making. The OP certainly gets to it by the end of the article.<p>I&#x27;ve gone through this process (tech stack shift), both as a recipient-of-change as well as a catalyst-agent-of-change. Remarking on the email that the OP&#x27;s CTO sent to everyone, these statements stick out:<p><pre><code>  &quot;...A technology choice will be made appropriately for the needs as we see them...&quot;
  &quot;...no hard decision has been made about our future languages or technologies...&quot;
  &quot;...Less C#/.Net, more Scala/Java/Open Source...&quot;
</code></pre>
The CTO likely has very good intentions, but this is an implied technical decision that&#x27;s already been made. He references &quot;we&quot; in the email to imply group participation in decision-making, but it is very much a you-are-with-us-or-you-are-against-us definition. To wit, those who didn&#x27;t buy in were shown the door.<p>Having been the guy in that chair, this is not an easy thing to do. Being handcuffed by prior technology decisions is not only difficult, it&#x27;s often untenable. Usually, the people hired into those leadership roles often have to resolve the decision making issues that got the company to that point. That said, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned in terms of how to go about these types of long-term changes:<p>- As the CTO, take full responsibility for introducing change. This is not taking credit, but instead being the owner of the decision and ensuring it succeeds. Support the team, and encourage them to openly question the decision, so that those questions can be addressed. The CTO&#x27;s email above makes a change decision requisite, but it&#x27;s up to everyone else to make it work. To anyone who&#x27;s worked in a potentially charged environment, that&#x27;s a typical setup for scapegoating. As the lead dog, don&#x27;t put your team in that position. If your decision comes off as playing-the-executive card, you have failed.<p>- As a team member, embrace change but make it completely objective. Be open to change, but only as it helps to reach a goal. Evaluate technologies after using them, comparing them, and finding what&#x27;s good and what&#x27;s not-so-good. Make your personal productivity the least-influential point of analysis. If you can&#x27;t find a way to assess something honestly because of your preference for operation, you&#x27;re doing yourself a disservice. Be productively critical of technical decisions -- your own, and others.",1382716591
6612343,comment,6611205,6611205,6,0,yk,,,"Looks interesting, just to take it for a quick spin I tested it with a small set of bookmarks. [1] Then I deactivated noScript and Disconnect and reactivated them individually. (Screenshots at 
<a href=""http://imgur.com/a/fRrnp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/fRrnp</a>
).<p>So the result is, that there are three sites which do not incorporate third party connections whatsoever (DDG, HN, fefe). Without the addons, the other sites form a connected graph. With disconnect, the graph is less strongly connected. With only noScript, it starts to fall apart. With both activated, the primary sites are disconnected. ( But the combination apparently breaks something, since a second Guardian primary node appears.)<p>A few caveats, first of all this is of course not reproducible, since it depends on my whitelists for noScript and Disconnect. And the test set is of course not representative for anything except itself. And absence of a edge in the graph does not mean absence of a connection. But with this in mind, I found it quite interesting how connected even a small test set is.<p>[1] guardian.co.uk

I haven&#x27;t been able to find documentation about the nbconvert templates so I&#x27;m dragging this out of memory from an email or a tweet I saw once upon a time.<p>One thing I&#x27;m hoping to figure out is a way to transform IPython Notebooks into PDFs that satisfy my university&#x27;s dissertation formatting guidelines (one inch margins, 12pt times, etc).<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/ipython/ipython/tree/master/IPython/nbconvert/templates"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ipython/ipython/tree/master/IPython/nbcon...</a>",1382715764

The only effectively useful feature of this is actually <i>adding an extra server layer</i>, not removing one.<p>--<p>Case 1: Startup X makes a webapp cluster that looks up user information and returns results. It calls a library, which looks up a hash key to query a disk, and returns data.<p>Problem 1: Lack of load balancing. If there are three disks, and user FRANK is on disk two, and user FRANK&#x27;s data is getting queried 50x more than the other users, that second disk is toast performance-wise.<p>Problem 2: No redundancy plus short lifespan of disk means when the disks die the user data goes too.<p>--<p>Case 2: Big Company Y creates a storage application layer to intelligently do things with the data. They have a small cluster of machines with apps that take queries and do things with the data, and manage the data using key/value pairs on disks attached to a private storage switch.<p>Problem 1: Dependent on ethernet (and its overhead, and latency) for each query doesn&#x27;t perform as fast as other disk interconnects; have to use hacks to increase performance. Network management now critical component of your storage functionality.<p>Problem 2: Because the Virtual Memory Manager is no longer managing a filesystem cache, all key/value fields must be cached by the application, so you&#x27;re re-implementing a VMM layer in your storage application. (Because nobody is stupid enough to <i>not</i> cache random disk queries)<p>Problem 3: Relational queries become almost completely useless. Performance drags due to all the individual queries, and you end up building a new cache layer just so your database can speed up searches, or at worst case end up with an index-only cluster of these disks.<p>--<p>As you can tell by reading Backblaze&#x27;s site, there are lots of different uses for storage and different requirements for each. But one thing that&#x27;s pretty widely acknowledged is it&#x27;s more efficient to have a really long single piece of storage versus lots of very short pieces.

She&#x27;s at a community college in California, and she&#x27;s both on the tenured faculty track and administration as a program director.  So, her experiences may not speak entirely to this article.<p>There are lots of problems inherent with academia that most people thinking about this field are not really thinking about.  The biggest problem, I think, is that for most 99% of all professors, once they are tenured, they are LOCKED down geographically.  And, that sucks.  My wife and I have one foot out the door all the time.  We go where the jobs are.  But, now that she&#x27;s on the tenure track, we wonder if this is where we&#x27;ll lay down and die.  It&#x27;s pretty sad, when I think about it.  You hear about it time and time again from so much of these guys. One of my old math professors had a page devoted to this.  He complained a lot about living in Hawaii and how his wife divorced him because of it.  He had a page up here:<p><a href=""http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~lee/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~lee/</a><p>But, apparently, after some time he decided to take down the more controversial stuff.  The index.html page to his ramblings are down.  Anyways, that&#x27;s a huge problem for academics.  And, I thought about it, and I think the biggest problem is the whole tenure thing.  I think it should be abolished.  Professors should be able to move to new institutions without worrying about that entire process, and they should be paid a better wage because of it.  It should be like any other free market enterprise we have nowadays.  And, Universities should also be able to get rid of dead weight.  I&#x27;ve had some professors in the past who just gave up on research and life.  For example, said professor mentioned above.  He gave up on math research because the University kept screwing them over on pay.  He retired with only 17 publications under his name.  My other friend who is now a tenured math professor at a 4 year college has 17 publications at just 37 years of age.  My other friend who has been teaching for about 10 years now has only 2 publications: his math Ph.D. dissertation, and a one page paper that probably isn&#x27;t worth the paper it&#x27;s printed on.  Anyways, I think it&#x27;s high time tenure is made obsolete.  It gives professors more latitude to move, probably better pay, and more incentive to do research or teach better.  It also gives schools and students the opportunity to get better teachers and lose the dead weight.",1382715354

Even then, it is reported as a homicide for the year of the conviction, not of the death. Granted, I don&#x27;t recall the source for this so I could be completely wrong. On the other hand, if someone is shot to death in the US and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be self-inflicted, it&#x27;s a homicide. If the person was shot in self-defense, it&#x27;s justified homicide. Another granted though, this is a very simplistic explanation.<p>Anyway, my point being is that if two countries don&#x27;t collect and categorize the data the same way then any type of comparison is pointless.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen the thought tossed out there that if you remove gang-related violence from the US statistics then the gun crime rate drops dramatically.

Although I hate ratings, let&#x27;s say men 8-10, are getting together with all the women 5-10. This can&#x27;t work in the long run, because people partner up 1-1, so those 8-10 men end up married to 8-10 women. What happens with all these women 5-7? They spent their twenties with men 8-10, and now they&#x27;re left with their equals, men 5-7, so they feel like they&#x27;re settling, or stepping down. At the same time, men feel like they&#x27;re dating up, because they never received attention from these women before. Meanwhile, they&#x27;re equal, but prior history leaves this skewed perspective.<p>In short, average women in their twenties get attention from great guys.

Fact - groups of investors have valued YC startups individually, and in aggregate the current known valuation of the collective is $13.7B.<p>Does that number mean that much by itself? Perhaps not. Let&#x27;s see what else we know.<p>2) That valuation has grown by $2B since June. Also fact. And pretty incredible, that&#x27;s a 17% growth on valuation in 4-5 months.<p>Without making any comments on whether or not YC&#x27;s success rate is higher/lower than average and whether or not YC is a benefit to the entrepreneurs it invests in (there&#x27;s no data presented here to make that assessment, but I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to do), what YC has done in a short amount of time in helping build a tremendous amount of value in its companies is noteworthy - and that&#x27;s what I take away from this article.",1382714578

I can&#x27;t lie, it made me sad when I saw the team starting to turn against Knockout, as the benefits it brings in the points I made above (as well as consistency and maintainability, as you brought up) are real - and often frontend projects suffer greatly for want of these very benefits.<p>I&#x27;ve never been good at convincing people of things, however, so it&#x27;s been an uphill battle - one that I lost a lot of ground on early, and I feel like a lot of our frontend codebase suffered as a result.  I do feel like they&#x27;re slowly starting to warm up to the benefits of it now that they&#x27;ve had some maintenance problems with the current approach, but that&#x27;s similar to sending an innocent man to prison for several years before discovering he&#x27;s innocent - it&#x27;ll take a while to undo what&#x27;s been done, if it can be undone.<p>Now, none of this is to say that they&#x27;re bad developers.

6612133,comment,6609601,6611899,5,0,talmand,,,"I disagree, but it depends on what type of warrant we&#x27;re talking about. I&#x27;m speaking of a search warrant. A search warrant is used to find and collect evidence that already exists. If authorities need you to change how your business runs to collect new evidence that doesn&#x27;t yet exist then that runs into a whole different set of laws. A search warrant doesn&#x27;t allow, or at least it shouldn&#x27;t, authorities to walk in and take over your business for their own purposes. Search warrants shouldn&#x27;t have that level of power because they are so easy to obtain, police just ask a judge to sign a piece of paper. It&#x27;s easy to obtain because all it should be is a piece of paper that allows law enforcement to enter your property without permission, which would normally be a crime, so that they can search for particular evidence. Search warrants can even be very, very specific as to what exactly law enforcement is really looking for within the property if the judge doesn&#x27;t want to be overly broad.<p>What you are describing does happen, but I fail to see how it would happen under a search warrant.<p>As for your destroying data being against the law if it is requested by the courts. You are correct, except that if your business model is to destroy data in a timely manner then you cannot be held in contempt for destroying data before it was requested. At that point it becomes something different as they have to request you no longer destroy that data so that they can collect it. I don&#x27;t see how that request falls under a search warrant. I suppose it could happen if a judge likes being overly broad in search warrants (which could cause problems in the criminal case), but it seems unlikely that&#x27;s how a typical search warrant would be executed.",1382714509

Different expectations of capability. When you are looking to hire non-Blub programmers, it&#x27;s a lot easier to find it in F/OSS-land.<p>F/OSS tooling has a big priority on interop with each other. MS tooling has a big priority on interop with MS (and companies that MS has contracts with or has strategic EEE priorities on).  Having a broader base of tools to use is a big deal.<p>F/OSS development progress can be monitored and input can be given (and patches can be sent in). This is in contrast to the proprietary approach where you pretty much have to take what you&#x27;re given, and input is limited (depending on company). So it&#x27;s easier to manage church and breakage risk in F/OSS.<p>Full-size enterprise MS licenses are not cheap. The numbers I&#x27;ve heard thrown around are <i>big</i>. And it seems that MS tooling is focused on vertical scaling, so your HW costs start looking very large as you stack your enterprise memory & HA storage systems into the box. This is opposed to &quot;el cheapo&quot; redundant pizzaboxes. So you start incurring a particular kind of expensive cost.<p>All of these are reasons I think F/OSS development is a better place to be, to hire from, and to want to go to. <i>None</i> of those reasons were given in the article, so we are left with speculation - was this just the CTO throwing his weight around? was this an attempt to move to a more mentally flexible organization? was this an attempt to cut costs?",1382713939

It essentially takes this DOM node:<p><pre><code>    <a data-bind=&quot;attr: {href: link()}, text: title()&quot;></a>
</code></pre>
And let&#x27;s you bind a JS object like this to it:<p><pre><code>    var my_view_model = {
        link: ko.observable(&quot;#foobar&quot;),
        title: ko.observable(&quot;A link&quot;)
    }
</code></pre>
Then, knockout watches the `my_view_model.link` and `my_view_model.title` attributes for changes.  When it &quot;observes&quot; a change of their value, it updates the DOM.<p>That&#x27;s about all you need to grok to see value out of Knockout.  If you can get your data into JS objects, Knockout can do a bang-up job of keeping your DOM in sync with your data.  As a &quot;backend guy&quot; that eliminates a whole lot of boilerplate JS I used to write whenever my data changed or I needed to keep track of state.<p>Knockout does more, of course, but from then on it&#x27;s mainly about adopting it to your use case (Do I mix it with Django templates?  Do I just go with a static-only frontend?  How do I manage AJAX requests to keep my JS objects data up-to-date?)",1382713650

Say there is a 55-45 ratio (with more women) among 30-something college-educated folks. Say, moreover, that by then 80% of the people are in relationships. That makes for 40 women paired up with 40 men, leaving 15 single women and just 5 single men.<p>I think a lot of this is self-inflicted, though. Professional women often still carry with them some of this 1960&#x27;s mentality and refuse to &quot;date down.&quot; As the demographics change and women being overrepresented among the college-educated, this puts them at the wrong end of a supply/demand imbalance.<p>On the other hand, some of the voluntary decisions are due to unfair social pressures. I think women wouldn&#x27;t wait so long to get married if doing so didn&#x27;t start a timer on their downshifting their career. My wife and I got married at 26/27 and had a baby shortly thereafter. My wife is a corporate lawyer and gets a lot of flak for working long hours, especially from family. Nobody ever gives me flak for working long hours. Painting in broad brush strokes, men tend to find that when they get married, society reinforces their career ambitions. Women tend to find that when they get married, society chips away at their career ambitions. Other women, particularly other moms, are the worst about it.",1382713458

There are also a lot of things outside of your control.</i><p>Of course there are things outside of our control.  But since you can&#x27;t control those things, there isn&#x27;t a whole lot of point worrying about them, is there?  (From the point of view of the individual).<p>I agree that there are systemic issues with &quot;the system&quot; as it exists today, and I have my ideas about how we should address some of those issues in terms of public policy, etc.  But, at the end of the day, you can only play the cards you&#x27;re dealt (so to speak).<p>What you can control, though, is your <i>reaction</i> to things, regardless of whether or not you can control those things.  If something bad happens (you get dealt a bad hand) you can quit (fold), and jump in the bathtub with a toaster and end it all. Or you can soldier on and make the best of things, and maybe, just  maybe, improve your lot.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of a couple of old sayings / parables I heard once.  One goes like this:<p><i>A master was living in a house in the woods.  One night, a storm came through and tore the roof off of his house.  He said &quot;I am happy, for now I can see the stars shining in the night sky more clearly&quot;.</i><p>The other is:<p><i>A man was running from a lion, when he came to the edge of a cliff, with a sheer plunge 1000 feet down to jagged rocks.  With no where else to go, he went over the edge and started climbing down some vines.  Now he&#x27;s trapped, with rocks below him, and the lion above him.  Then a mouse appears and starts chewing on the vine.  He notices some strawberries growing on the cliff face and plucks a handful and eats them.  They were the most delicious strawberries he ever had&quot;.</i><p><i>It&#x27;s the perfect excuse to individualize all kind of problems. You just did not work enough and put not effort into it.</i><p>I guess it depends on your perspective, but - in my mind - this isn&#x27;t about &quot;blaming the victim&quot; or anything.  Life <i>does</i> suck sometimes, and some people certainly are dealt shitty hands.  I just think that you can only take the hand you start from, and then make the best of it through conscious choice and effort.<p>And as somebody who grew up dirt poor in rural southeast NC, living below the poverty line for large swathes of time in my life, I&#x27;ve literally been through this.  I could have accepted my lot in life as a poor, uneducated, country bumpkin, but I refused to do it.  I couldn&#x27;t control that my parents weren&#x27;t wealthy, or that our public schools weren&#x27;t great, or that my dad never graduated high-school and was basically illiterate.  But I could control my actions, by choosing to spend my time in the library studying instead of hanging out behind the school playing handball and smoking weed... After high-school I could control choosing to work 3rd shift, buffing and waxing floors at a grocery story, then getting off work at 7am to drive 35 miles to be in class at 8:00.  Believe me, Discrete Math at 8:00am when you&#x27;ve been up all night is no fun.  And then going and sleeping on a couch in the library for an hour or two before your afternoon classes, that&#x27;s no fun either.  But I made a choice that I didn&#x27;t want to be a poor, uneducated country bumpkin, so I made the sacrifices I had to make.<p>I could have gone out on dates, went bowling with my friends, gone to football games, and thousands of other things... but night after night after night I sat home alone with a stack of C and C++ books, downloading code from BBS&#x27;s (and later, the Internet), learning to code and honing my skills.<p>It wasn&#x27;t easy and there were tradeoffs (there is a reason I never got married and had kids, for example), but I got out of redneckville and have gone on to have a pretty decent career, and now I am the founder of a startup that has some real potential.<p>So, yeah, put me in the camp of people who do put a lot of stock in the idea of &quot;individual empowerment&quot;, because I&#x27;ve experienced it firsthand.",1382713305

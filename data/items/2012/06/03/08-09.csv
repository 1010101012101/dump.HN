It's refreshing to see one that not only makes sense, but is also thoroughly researched and backed up by a good knowledge of the facts and intricacies of the subject at hand.<p>Unfortunately, it's likely this is due to the high profile of the case and the deep pockets of the litigants.

Run powertop and it will show you what's using power and offer to turn it off.  My experience with Thinkpads (from two or three years ago) is that running Windows gives you about 10 hours of battery life while doing essentially nothing, while running Linux gives you 8 hours.  Both are so high that it doesn't really matter.  My X220 has never run out of battery, and I fly a lot and don't really plug my laptop in at home, so 8 hours is apparently enough.<p>For your second point, just explicitly command your computer to do what you want.  If you want it to go to sleep, type ""acpitool -s"".  If you don't want it to go to sleep, don't type that.<p>If you like OS X, use it, but if you hate OS X and are only using it because of the two issues you list above, that's crazy :)",1338713246

Getting new employees up to speed is expensive.<p>* When a part time worker leaves, they take away their knowledge of the business. This is scary to some because folk worry about competitors. This is scary to all because it's knowledge that you need to build up again internally. Your staff are an asset.<p>* Startups need to build teams. It's much harder to build teams when some of the members aren't their for 50% or more of the time.<p>Flip it around.<p>Would you hire somebody half time if they told you that they were spending the rest of their time focusing on their own startup? Would you think that they'd be <i>really</i> focussed on your work? Would you think they'd be more or less likely to leave on short notice if their startup took  off?

Haphazardly throwing cheese, sauce, and pepperoni together on dough never makes good pizza (in my not so unbiased opinion as a New Yorker). While good pizza recipes obviously require trial and error to get there, they need to be built on a foundation of deep understanding. See <a href=""http://www.varasanos.com/PizzaRecipe.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.varasanos.com/PizzaRecipe.htm</a> to get a feel for how difficult it actually is to make good pizza. You can have a successful business without a great product if your location and marketing are good, but I would not be happy running a successful software business that didn't sell good software. So I'm focusing this post on the quality of the business's product, not on how much revenue it makes. While you don't have to be the smartest person in the room to build a great product, you would need to be a great founder and be very good at surrounding yourself with smart people and knowing how to make them operate at their smartest, knowing which suggestions to follow, etc. Average founders almost never luck out completely (and stay successful) and in the specific case of pizza, the New Yorker in me doesn't believe that's possible. :)<p>That being said, the original OP (I know that seems redundant) was talking about the person with the fewest specific skills, not the least intelligent. Most great founders probably have intelligence or skills, if not both.",1338711524

4060329,comment,4059159,4059159,2,0,Todd,,,"It's anyone's guess how successful W8 will be in the long run. Windows market share on the PC is still nearly 90%. The big question is, how will it do in the tablet market?<p>If you look at the WP7 case, it's not promising. Even after nearly two years, WP7 doesn't even have 5% market share. Sales aren't sufficient to support most developers.<p>That said, it's an earlier phase in the development of the tablet market. It's quite possible that MS will fare better here. One reason WP7 didn't do so well is that all of the other hardware manufacturers (excluding Apple, obviously) had already jumped on the Android bandwagon and were doing well there. The same can't be said of the tablet space at this point.<p>Every non Apple hardware manufacturer wants to have a real horse in the tablet game. It could be argued that the Android tablets were an opportunity for manufacturers to get their game in order for W8 (this, and mobile experience, for those that develop phones). There will be a ton of marketing money behind W8 in the coming year, driven, in part, by all of the hardware partners that MS works with.<p>MS has a great development tool chain. They also have excellent UX research backing W8 and the experience is likely to be much better on W8 for the average tablet user.<p>My guess is that by the time W9 ships, MS will have significant market share and they will have sorted out most of the kinks with W8. It's early days right now and there are likely to be some bumps. This will be a bit like Vista vs. W7. The first version was pretty good for what it was and they nailed it in the second release. The difference is that this time, the ""first version"" is quite good, given the significant departure from the past.<p>If you've got Windows experience, I would say, go for it. In particular, if you've done any Silverlight or WPF, the learning curve is mostly behind you. If not, you've got several avenues to approach it: HTML/CSS/JS or C#/XAML, or even C++ with XAML or DirectX. There will be a learning curve, of course.<p>If you're looking for a new opportunity, to be honest, I can't think of anything else on the near horizon that compares. It could be, meh, but it could also be huge. Good luck.",1338710500

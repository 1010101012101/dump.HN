I've heard of many other cities already, but I'd like to narrow it down to two starting criteria (feel free to add your own):<p>* Opportunity- for those who would just like to go work, the level of demand for software developers. For those who would like to launch a startup outside of SV, the abundance of VC firms and other sources of funding in the area.<p>* Quality of life- the Bay Area has unrivaled weather, and unrivaled high rent prices. How do other cities compare?",1349578795

4622465,comment,4621472,4622392,3,0,pyre,,,"The origin of 'doxing' on 4chan was to do things like convince a female that was 'attention-whoring' on the forum to do things like post nude photos of herself. Some people would immediately try to figure out who she was, in some cases they would do things like send the nude photos to work, school, and/or family, in addition to telling everyone in the forum the name/address/etc of the target.<p>In this sense, it makes sense for the dox'ers to want to \nremain anonymous. You're convincing someone to do something, then turning it on them to attempt to ruin their life.<p>So 'doxing' is more specifically about <i>destroying</i> someone's anonymity (or pseudo-anonymity if they maintain an alias), at least in it's origins.",1349578721

4622456,comment,4616500,4617089,1,0,ddimitrov,,,">> There's an interesting point to be made here, though - ""wrapping everything up in one type"" is essentially what dynamic type systems do, except that it's baked into the language instead of being implemented by the programmer on an as-needed basis.<p>This is imprecise - a dynamic language does not really need to ""wrap everything in one type"" - look at Dart or Groovy. What makes it 'dynamic' is the dynamic dispatch. All dynamic languages I know dispatch based on runtime argument types, but this is only one particular <i>form</i> of dynamic dispatch. Declaring types in dynamic language typically is used at runtime merely as an assertion, that at this point the argument must conform to the said type.<p>Dynamic dispatch differs from Polymorphic dispatch in the way that polymorphic dispatch takes in account the runtime type of the target (the object whose method you are calling), but the types of the parameters are fixed at compile time.<p>Many dynamic languages also provide a way to customize the dispatch logic (i.e. call a default handler if no match exists) - typically via some form of Meta Object Protocol. Often the dynamic languages provide features like higher order functions, continuations, pattern matching, etc. but this has nothing to do with their dynamicity - same features are available in some static languages as well.",1349578408

These categories are sociopolitical constructs and should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature. Furthermore, the race categories include both racial and national-origin groups.<p>""The racial classifications used by the Census Bureau adhere to the October 30,1997, Federal Register Notice entitled,""Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity"" issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).""<p>In other words, the professional demographers who work on the United States Census claim only to be following the law, not to be practicing biological, anthropological, or genetic science when they ask for self-identification of ""race."" That claim has continued through two different presidential administrations as the bureau conducted two successive decennial censuses and numerous community surveys. The Census Bureau practice is based on regulations from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which were announced on 30 October 1997<p><a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg_1997standards"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg_1997standards</a><p>to take effect no later than 1 January 2003 for data collection by all federal agencies. The summary of comments on the 1997 regulations makes clear that not all Americans are united in agreeing with the current set of categories. (The categories used by the federal government have changed several times in my lifetime.) The distinct differences between the categories used in the United States and those used in any other country in the world should make clear that categories are indeed ""sociopolitical constructs and should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature."" I bring this up because several recent threads here on Hacker News have interpreted ""race"" categories as if they have genetic or anthropological meaning, which they do not.<p>The long story about how to think carefully about race and ethnicity in the human population can be found in the books recommended for first reading in a Wikipedia user bibliography ""Anthropology, human biology, and race citations bibliography""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/AnthropologyHumanBiologyRaceCitations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/Anthropol...</a><p>in Wikipedia user space.",1349578340

I used to think IDEs didn't matter much for basic code editing, but had to change my opinion after using Eclipse and IntelliJ (my preference) for a while.  Higher-level (as in -- with knowledge of the programming language) editing and refactoring can make a big difference to your editing experience.  Tasks that were tedious become trivial and part of the normal flow.  You actually find yourself writing code in a different way once you understand how easily you can manipulate blocks of code (rather than just blocks of text).",1349577183

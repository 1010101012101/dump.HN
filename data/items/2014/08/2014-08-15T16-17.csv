8183064,comment,8178743,8179731,1,0,graycat,,,"> delivered through a shell company<p>You lost me.  Suppose from here, where I am, in the US I set up a foreign corporation, and it buys a nice house in NY State.  I move in as a &#x27;renter&#x27;.<p>Then too soon the IRS notices that I am living high on the hog, e.g., in a nice house, but paying very little in income taxes.<p>Similarly if the garage of the house has a half dozen &#x27;super cars&#x27; worth $1 million or so each.  And maybe the interior decorating of the house is drop dead gorgeous, cost $1+ million, which  the IRS could notice if they could can inside, maybe with a search warrant, or even just interview a maid I hired to run a vacuum cleaner, and then get a search warrant.<p>So, the IRS and their lawyers start after me?<p>Okay, maybe I pay a &#x27;fair&#x27; rent for the house and pay it to the offshore company.  My understanding is that that doesn&#x27;t work because that company needs a US branch office that has to file US taxes.  So, the IRS could get my banking records and see the rent checks I paid.  Okay if could arrange that somehow the US branch office made $0 earnings each year so that it owed no US taxes, maybe.<p>Or, maybe I &#x27;work&#x27; for the US branch office, and they pay me a salary, and I pay my rent to them.  Hmm.  But the rent would have to come from ordinary income, after tax?<p>Or, use part of the house for my business and pay part of the rent as an ordinary business expense from my pre-tax revenue?  Maybe for a little of the house, say, a home office, that would be okay with the IRS, but that leaves maybe the other 90% of the house the IRS would insist that I pay for in some sense out of taxable ordinary income.<p>Or maybe be an employee of the US company and hired as a &#x27;house sitter&#x27; keeping the house safe and, thus, don&#x27;t pay rent?  The IRS might just tell a judge that this whole setup is tax fraud and let me have an extended 1 on 1, in person, tutoring session with Bernie Madoff?<p>Or maybe the US company could sell me the house for, say, $1000, and somehow I would convince the IRS that my little house, that cost $10 million to build, is something a person paying so little in taxes could afford?  I could get the IRS and a tax court judge to agree with that?<p>Maybe I&#x27;d like 2000 acres of New Hampshire woods around the house.  Okay, maybe the US company buys the woods as an investment and lets me and my kitty cats make some use of the woods, the stream that flows through, the lake from a dam on the stream, etc.?<p>I guess basically I&#x27;m lost on how I could live in a $10 million house and still convince the IRS that am within the law.<p>Or, maybe a corporation owns the house but has a lot of debts otherwise so in total is next to worthless, and I buy the corporation for $1, keep the $10 million house, and do something, somehow I don&#x27;t mind doing, about the debts of the corporation.  E.g., maybe my business loaned the corporation $10 million that the corporation used to buy/build the house.  Then the corporation is worth essentially $0.  Then I buy the corporation for $1.  I keep the house.  For the debt, my business calls that a loss.<p>I&#x27;m trying to understand.",1408121990

This an important part of the volunteer coordinator&#x27;s job, as there are hours/year requirements for volunteers, awards given out annually, etc. Prior to that they were using a paper binder with sign-in sheets, and adding up everything by hand at the end of the month. With about 1000 active volunteers, this was no small task, and seemed like a place computerization would be an amazing help. I wrote up a simple system in Rails (which I had spent a fair amount of hobby time with) and it&#x27;s been running there ever since.<p>Today, there are about 67,000 &quot;hours&quot; entries in the database, about about 3,000 volunteers (1/3 of them active), and the system is a little slower than it ought to be (my original testing was with tens of records, since there was no existing database to import). Rather than try to update and re-learn ruby and rails, I opted to give a try porting the essential parts of the system to Python using bottle.py<p>The result of my work is now up on github and licensed under MIT.<p>I&#x27;m at a point where things are about functionally complete and I&#x27;d love to hear feedback from anyone willing to take the time to take a look at it.

One day I said fuck it..I&#x27;m tired of the rat race and want to craft my own perfect SaaS.<p>I was 32, a bit frightened, used to my expensive NYC lifestyle, had crazy ccard debt and was still paying off grad-school loans.<p>But I didn&#x27;t want to live with the &#x27;what if&#x27;.<p>How could I pull off the 6-month runway i needed to create my perfection?\nI moved to Argentina - where I found my dollar had 3x the buying power - and was able to stay in the same time zone with my existing clients in NYC. (most didn&#x27;t even knew I left )<p>>> Fast fwd 8 yrs later.. \nI’m on my 3rd startup. \nBut now I have a co-founder wife and 2yr old that keep my ass in check.<p>Everyday is brutal.. it’s slow going ( since we are bootstrapped and split time between consulting) and on the toughest days I do think about just ejecting and going back to a cushy golden-handcuff job..especially now that my family needs stability...and I dream of a good night&#x27;s sleep.<p>But then there are those days when I&#x27;m user-testing..and get to watch people come to life with the dormant creativity which our platform has re-awakened deep inside. Or when a random VC calls to say &quot;I really love what you are doing..let&#x27;s keep in touch&quot;.. That’s when it’s all worth it.<p>It’s when you are faced with death at your throat - and have your family in your corner - that greatness truly has a chance to blossom.<p>I have a few more rounds left in me. But regardless I will never have regrets; instead I’ve got one hell of a story, family, and mvp to be proud of.<p>So do your good work quietly, laugh everyday… water your seeds....and one day they will sprout, young man.",1408120870

The laboratory business is already very competitive, and unless they have some crazy technological revolution going on this is a lot of hot air. Getting these tests approved by the FDA for diagnostic use is HARD and in addition to have the consumer send in a sample the tests need to be CLIA waived.  What that means is that there is an even higher burden to prove the test is not very prone to error.<p>One thing that is good here is pricing transparency and legislation is moving now in states requiring that lab results have to be delivered from the lab directly to the patient if the patient requests it (New York recently did this). BUT that does not mean you can draw your own blood. You still need to have your blood drawn in the traditional way and sent out to a reference lab.  So while direct to patient testing will certainly pan out, I do not see how this hot start up has any advantage over the many very large reference labs out there.

My tangible goal has been redesigning one of my company&#x27;s products.<p>3)  Before each session I send my designer a page or two I want to focus on (e.g. client list and client edit pages), goals and sample content, and examples of designs I like for inspiration.  We both work on designing those pages independently.  We don&#x27;t share or view each other&#x27;s work until we&#x27;re in session.<p>4)  Once we&#x27;re in session we review our designs and discuss each of our decisions on spacing, content choice, emphasizing this or that via different font styling, coloring, etc.  As expected, my designer&#x27;s work is always superior, but the real eye openers are when he walks me through why that is, especially when he points out how much easier, faster, but more relaxed my eye gets to what it wants on a given page w/his designs vs. mine.<p>We&#x27;ve had 6 sessions so far and I&#x27;m convinced this is the best method of learning design (just as having a private tutor is superior for many other things).  If you have someone you can hire for a similar arrangement, at least consider doing so, I highly recommend it.<p>[1][a]  Designing Web Applications (Nathan Barry)<p>[1][b]  The Non-Designer&#x27;s Design Book (Robin Williams)<p>[1][c]  Don&#x27;t Make Me Thing (Steve Krug)",1408120245

My guess would be that we&#x27;re seeing -- in this article, and in the Fortune profile linked on HN a few months ago -- the results of an incredibly well orchestrated and tightly controlled PR strategy. Say what you will about Elizabeth Holmes, but she is no dummy. She knows exactly what she is doing. The comparisons to Steve Jobs that seem to pop up in all of these articles are no accident. They feel intentionally cultivated, and perhaps to <i>some</i> degree, they&#x27;re warranted. [1] Jobs also had a knack for image-making, be it in the tight control he exercised over the flow of information inside and outside his company, and in the image he ensured that the media portray.<p>Does the emperor wear no clothes here? I have no idea. I know next to nothing about the inner workings of the company, or about the medtech world (though I do find it fascinating). I do know that marketing matters a great deal, and traditional biotech and medtech companies don&#x27;t seem to care too much about consumer image. They rely on time-tested sales channels and retail strategies. Theranos is different in the respect that it&#x27;s running an Apple-esque marketing and PR playbook in an industry that traditionally does not.<p><i>&quot;what these people are doing for lab testing, in terms of technology, sounds totally revolutionary IF YOU DON&#x27;T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CLINICAL LABS.&quot;</i><p>Yes, and I think Theranos/Holmes are well aware of that fact. If anything, they see it as an opportunity to seize a beachhead in consumer consciousness. The thinking process seems to be: most consumers know virtually nothing about how this all works, ergo, we can appear as gods before them. That is a speculative and perhaps cynical read, but at the same time, I admire their savvy. I admire it a great deal.<p>[1] Preemptive note: I am saying &quot;to some&quot; degree here. :) I&#x27;m not saying she is Steve Jobs, or that the comparison need extend any further, to any other dimensions, than in the specific area I&#x27;m talking about in this case. But I think you can make the case that someone who always appears in black turtlenecks, and has a way of invoking the name &quot;Steve Jobs&quot; in almost every major article about her, is intentionally aiming for the comparison.

There&#x27;s all kinds of issue with the theremin on the attack of the notes that drives me a little batty.<p>I used to play around with digital tracking quite a bit, and one technique I developed that improved the sound considerably was to start note playback at some random offset near the beginning of the sample. It made the attacks sound more complicated and &quot;human&quot; even without playing around with the timing of any of the notes. If I had a second sample from somewhere else on the same instrument, I&#x27;d also sometimes substitute it on the same note as the first sample, just to provide some variety in the tone during the sustain.<p>One other idea, bouncing off of your group performance focus, is to focus on folk or ancient music ensemble type music. The nature of the virtuoso performances in those kinds of milieus is very different and maybe less technical than in more classical venues.<p>I remember taking an interest in Celtic fiddle music and attending some jam nights at some area pubs. It was pretty fascinating, everybody just sort of brought whatever instrument they played and if they could add to the song just sort of did what their instrument did. At any one time there might be  a guy with a kazoo, some fiddle players, a couple flutists, autoharp, hurdy gurdy, guitar, saxaphone, etc. I&#x27;d imagine some electric instrument (so long as they didn&#x27;t overpower the group) would blend in well enough. It was pretty intoxicating and the random collection of instruments almost always sounded fantastic.<p>The best example I can think of for how it sounded was something like La Bottine Souriante, a group which basically brings a complete random collection of instruments on stage and plays the hell out of them following elements of a traditional Quebec style of folk music (but at a high level) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYza0wxs7Ic"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYza0wxs7Ic</a><p>A smaller ensemble might be Väsen, who feature a Nyckelharpa in their music. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78hGmYwnNHg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78hGmYwnNHg</a><p>With ancient music, the techniques are less well developed when you play in the original style, even on something like a violin. The bowing is greatly simplified, you may not even be playing with vibrato. Complex hand positions are reduced, playing on open strings (no fingers) is okay. As a musical target it&#x27;s appealing for electronic instruments and seems to tolerate the transition better than more modern music.<p>And it turns out it sometimes sounds amazing:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi5-WRgA5GI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi5-WRgA5GI</a><p>In fact here&#x27;s a fantastic example on an EVI<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd1gKm6QyDw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd1gKm6QyDw</a><p>Sometime after Bach a <i>lot</i> of modern performance technique was invented, and eventually you end up with Paganini, who&#x27;s music is unplayable on any electronic instrument I&#x27;ve ever seen. But he&#x27;s doing crazy things like left hand pizzicatos in the middle of a bowing section and alternating between the wood and the hair of the bow while playing harmonics and all sorts of madness. But even just Paganini Caprice No. 24 pretty much exercises just about 95% of anything you can do on a violin.

The first time I was forced to do my homework on this subject was for a school project (5 years ago, IIRC) and I was blown away by two things that ran completely against the &quot;informed&quot; opinion I had developed by passively consuming media. First, the professionalism, restraint, and abundance of goodwill gestures I saw coming out of Monsanto (see: their press releases, their research papers, and their stance on terminator genes). Second, the extent to which Monsanto&#x27;s political adversaries were willing to lie and intentionally mislead in order to pursue their objectives (see: Percy Schmeiser, the Seralini paper, Greenpeace&#x27;s Terminator Gene media sprint). My preconceptions going into the project were astonishingly far from the truth -- they were the exact opposite of it. If your intent is to be fair, that means considering both sides of the story and trying to determine where the truth lies. Be honest with yourself: have you actually done this for the Monsanto/GMO debate? Or have you let your political view align itself to that of the news articles that occasionally percolate through your feeds (as I had done)?<p>2. I don&#x27;t recall disingenuously talking about nuclear power from only the technical side. You are correct to note that the discussion should revolve around whether or not we have the technology to account for human error. You are incorrect to assume that the discussion in the corresponding academic, industrial, and regulatory circles does not revolve around this matter. &quot;Technology has failed to take certain kinds of failures and human errors into account, therefore technology can never be expected take enough failures and human errors into account to be made safe&quot; is a very defeatist attitude of the precise variety that TFA was complaining about. It&#x27;s the lazy conclusion that dystopian SF authors default to in order to sound profound and relevant without wading waist-deep through boring technical analysis (which is what you need to do to actually <i>be</i> profound and relevant).<p>> Much of what happened in Fukushima can be chalked up to the human factor.<p>Straw man. Just like software engineers don&#x27;t dismiss UX problems by saying &quot;there&#x27;s nothing to be done about stupid users,&quot; nuclear engineers don&#x27;t dismiss catastrophes (hypothetical or actual) by saying &quot;there&#x27;s nothing to be done about stupid regulators.&quot; Instead, they find a way to fix the human problem by using the technology at their disposal. That&#x27;s their job and they&#x27;re quite good at it.<p>Unfortunately, there is ~50years of lag between industrial best practices and the point at which we can evaluate the safety record of said best practices. The first academic nuclear reactor was constructed 70 years ago. The first commercial nuclear reactor was constructed 60 years ago. Fukushima was built 50 years ago. 45 years ago, the mode of failure that did it in was discovered and corrected in new designs. Still, it&#x27;s quite correct to note that the safety practices of nuclear engineers 50 years ago were not robust to mismanagement (which would have retrofitted or retired the reactor). But that has little bearing on the question of whether or not the safety practices of nuclear engineers <i>today</i> are robust to poor regulation, and that&#x27;s the question that is relevant to our policy regarding new reactors. I&#x27;m convinced that today&#x27;s safety practices <i>are</i> robust to poor oversight. Robust enough to make them an extremely compelling alternative, in any case.<p>3.

Ballard was an acquired taste in its day, and it was never mainstream-definitive. It was a creative and interesting counterpoint to a mainstream literature and cinema that was largely dominated by optimism.<p>Today&#x27;s mainstream is mostly pessimistic (and boringly, generically so). Pessimistic sci-fi from previous eras was bold and thought-provoking, perhaps because it was playing against the grain. And it was also very personal. Philip K. Dick wrote directly from Philip K. Dick&#x27;s mind, not from some dispassionate calculation of the market&#x27;s tastes. Today&#x27;s pessimistic sci-fi is really just warmed-over teen romance or paint-by-numbers action/adventure with dystopian settings, a lot of it written (and selected for publication) to capitalize on a trend.<p><i>&quot;Star Trek TNG was produced before the fall of the Berlin Wall, at the height of the cold war.&quot;</i><p>Yes, but TNG was created under Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s watchful guidance. At least in its early run (really, up until his death), it was following the philosophical precepts he&#x27;d laid down in TOS, way back when. You could make an argument that TNG was a 1960s show, made in the 1980s and 1990s.<p><i>&quot;It&#x27;s the stuff that changes the world that will be remembered, not the spoon-fed fear mongering of mainstream dystopian sci-fi drama.&quot;</i><p>No argument here. I have little doubt that the dime-a-dozen dystopias of today will not be remembered in three or four decades as anything more than a market-driven fad.

Tabs take up less space in terms of bytes, and are dynamic width allowing the user to set the width to their personal preference.

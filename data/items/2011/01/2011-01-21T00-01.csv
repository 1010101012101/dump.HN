2125999,story,,,1,1,TheCondor,"What kinds of cash managment and financial practices do your startups use?",,"I have what I feel is a somewhat naive set of questions.   I've been part of 4 startups but always on the engineering side of things both as an engineer and a leader.  I've been exposed to a lot of the financial aspects of one company that was successful.   At this new company,  I'm simply an individual contributor with no leadership responsibilities.<p>So my question is, what kinds of cash management practices are typical in your startups?    This current company is regularly slow paying vendors, as a matter of business practice.  Typically we don't pay until past 60 days, and we have money in the bank.  The one other company where I was exposed to the finances,  we would let companies know when we couldn't pay them and we tried to be forthcoming the few times it happened.  The CEO says it's just aggressive cash management and unlikely to change.  I know a lot of large companies slow pay because of their bureaucracy,  it's the first time I've seen it at a small company when it wasn't needed.    Personally, I feel bad about it as a lot of the people we are slow to pay are fairly small and independent vendors.<p>Secondly,  we bill monthly for our service,  we need to send out
between 200 and maybe 500 invoices a month, not an incredibly large number.  Some of the early sales work was sort of fly by the seat of the pants and so there is some differences in what customers pay.  We've been trying to use salesforce.com.   What I've seen is that we don't regularly invoice customers,  sometimes we won't bill them for 3 or 4 months at a time. Our more sophisticated customers have actually complained about it.  At least one time our CEO had to give credits to a company because we didn't bill them regularly and they were upset with it(?!?)  How many companies kind of have these growing pains?  Everywhere else we've been rock solid on the accounting and billing,  I've never been to a place that has had problems like this,  are these legitimately growing
pains or serious red flags?",1295571415

2125985,comment,2125115,2125115,0,0,getpost,,,"I started meditating in 2007, and it has completely changed my life. The benefits I've noticed are too numerous to list, but for example:<p>- My ability to sustain attention and keep a lot of details in mind (say, for writing code) has improved significantly. Before I started my practice, my ability to code was declining with age.<p>- I'm much less reactive than I used to be. I have more ability to choose what I say and how I act. Of course, I still can and do make unskillful choices.<p>- Rather than expend energy on judgement, on right vs. wrong, I now focus on skillful vs unskillful. Meditation does change your view of the world. You realize you can't control your mind. So it's not, ""I think, therefore I am."" It's, ""I think, therefore there are thoughts."" A healthy relationship to your thoughts removes many obstacles.<p>The thing about meditation is that you have to actually do it.  No amount of knowledge of the various techniques can substitute for actual practice. For this reason, as michael_dorfman says, you really do need a teacher. Don't just read the menu, eat the food.<p>Buddhist Geeks[1] is a great podcast. It has interviews with various Buddhist and non-dual teachers.<p>In Berkeley, there's an excellent pay-what-you-want 6 week beginner class offered by James Baraz[2]. The first session is presented without any Buddhist stuff.  The remaining sessions have Buddhist content, to elucidate the foundations of practice. Plenty of people who are not interested in Buddhism take the class.  Many of James' talks are on DharmaSeed[3], another great source of Buddhist audio.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/</a>

2125955,comment,2124592,2124592,0,0,thinkwise,,,"Group buying has been around for eons starting in China known as tuangou. Although there are lots of new competitors in the space, there is clearly a great deal of pent up demand from local businesses in the marketplace. I doubt that this form of consumer purchasing will die anytime soon.<p>One should ask themselves why there is so much pent up demand for group buying in the marketplace?<p>Some critics focus on poor efficacy rates for repeat business from Groupon customers.  Others will claim that it is a fad.  Still others will argue that the business running a Groupon campaign will not make money from the deal.<p>But what is the alternative?<p>The alternative for most businesses is to purchase ads in local print newspapers, create print flyers, and other more traditional means of marketing, which all require upfront costs from the local business.  Most small businesses do not use online SEM.<p>The great advantage with Groupon is there are no upfront costs. (1) Businesses get thousands of impressions from the email marketing campaigns showcasing their deal.  (2) If a deal gets executed the business gets guaranteed foot traffic and revenue from customers, which is trackable. (3) There is the potential to acquire a percentage of new customers as repeat customers.  All of this with no upfront costs.<p>The reason I am very optimistic on the continued growth of this model of purchasing is that the market is validating it.  You can see this from the explosive revenue growth numbers of group buying companies.  And businesses recognize that it is much more cost effective and measurable to launch a Groupon than invest in the alternative.<p>So the analysis should not be what is the best or perfect solution for local businesses to acquire customers, but what is a marginally better alternative for customer acquisition.  Group buying is.<p>For large businesses, I see a similar value. I would make an educated guess that Gap and Amazon spend a great deal of money on customer acquisition. Thus the group buying economics probably work in their favor. I would have a hard time believing that they lost money on their Groupon campaigns.  Even if they broke even, it is a campaign that successfully drove millions of paying customers to their site, broke major headlines, and was great PR for both companies.  Just because you are a big company doesn't mean that you do not appreciate this kind of attention.<p>We are witnessing the nascent stages in the evolution of group buying.  Larger companies like Groupon and LivingSocial will build an incredible amount of data to mine for new initiatives like determining their customers' preferences and targeting them for secondary purchases.  This is just the beginning.",1295570371

2125932,comment,2125742,2125742,0,0,ionfish,,,"Here's one example of this kind of phenomenon. If you really want to understand a question, write a paper about it. It's easy enough to read five or ten research papers in an area, and if you do that thoroughly, and write extensive notes as you do so, you'll start to feel that you understand the area and the issues involved.<p>However, if the way you learn is much like mine, when you try to start writing you will realise that you haven't grasped it with anything like the fullness that you had thought. Start writing anyway: you have a bibliography, and hopefully you have a rough idea of the thesis you want to defend. Write the literature review sections. Sketch outlines of arguments, and then try to take them apart. Find counterexamples. If your position has any merit, you will eventually figure out some convincing arguments. Flesh them out: write a first draft, as rough as you like. Improve it by smoothing out poor phrasing and removing extravagant, unsupported claims (it may only be obvious once you've written them that this is what they are).<p>After some time you will have a reasonably presentable paper. More than that, though, you will actually understand the issues: how the various ideas in the field fit together, why you really disagree with some of the papers you've read, and perhaps even what your own take on it is. It's hard work! But writing is what makes the difference. If you just read a lot you can come away with the misapprehension that you understand the field, when in reality you just know a lot about what people have written.",1295569941

Not of those that make the news or your typical ""fundamentalist"". I read and study the Bible and do my best to be a good person, understanding the world around me yet living as closely as possible from that which God has asked of me, through the Bible. And if you ask, I've been doing pretty good at it while remaining relevant in the world around me, even in the tech community, so often agnostic or even atheist.<p>Meditation, unlike commonly thought of, is not about ""emptying your mind"" or ""getting in tune with the Universe"". Meditation is all about letting a thought, concept or idea completely soak your brain. That allows you a superior cognitive understanding of it. The different areas of your brain will be called to process it from all different angles.
From a Christian standpoint, there are a few things that we are called to meditate on: ""(…) whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things."" (<a href=""http://bible.us/Phil4.8.ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bible.us/Phil4.8.ESV</a>) If you read the previous verses on that passage (4-6), it talks about ""rejoicing"" and ""not worrying"". That is only possible when you let your brain soak in the pure, lovely, commendable, excellent, etc thoughts.<p>Now, I'm not trying to preach or ask you to follow Christ or God. What I'm telling you is that meditation is <i>actively</i> thinking about certain things and those things alone. It's not passive. It's not ""emptying your mind"". That is relaxation and it's also a good thing. But ""emptying your mind"" without filling it with the right things can have terrible consequences.<p>Personally, I'm trying to ""disconnect"" a little bit more. Less Twitter. Less RSS. Less… Apple rumors. Why? Those are all fine things and I enjoy knowing the latest news on the things that interest me. But living on the ""now"" has terrible consequences over how I analyze the past and prepare the future. I need to read more books and… meditate on what is important.<p>Bottom line: take time off, unplug, relax. Read/listen to things that fit the verse I quoted or bring up things that are either troubling or exciting you. Then allow yourself to unwind by letting the silence around you help you focus on what you have soaked your brain in. And I'd say ""pray"", but that mind be beyond the scope of your question… ;)",1295568439

It's nowhere near an exact match, but it's still worth something.<p>Let's use the term ""entry level jobs"" for an example.<p><a href=""http://www.entryleveljobsite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.entryleveljobsite.com</a> ranks #9 right now, yet it's link profile is far inferior to my site <a href=""http://www.onedayonejob.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onedayonejob.com</a> which ranks at #16. Yes, there are probably some other factors included, but my feeling is that the domain name has a lot to do with it. If you look at the SERPs, you'll see that the entryleveljobs in entrylevejobsite.com is bolded. That right there tells me that Google sees the keywords in the URL.<p>Btw, I'm using SEOmoz's Open Site Explorer to compare link profiles.<p>Additionally, many of the links that you build will have CV in the anchor text because of your domain name. That's huge.<p>A domain like mycv.com would be great if you're trying to rank for CV. CV.com would be better, but that's unrealistic.<p>However, I'd push you to use Google's AdWords Keyword Tool to do some more research on what keywords you want to use in the domain name.",1295568218

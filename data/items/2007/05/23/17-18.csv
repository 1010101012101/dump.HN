A big part of SEO is:<p>1) Making sure search engines can find and understand all of your pages.\n2) Making sure that people want to visit your site when your pages show up on SERPs.\n3) Making sure that LOTS of people link to you and talk about you online (the PlentyofFish guy has nailed this).\n4) Assorted markup tricks that help people find your site better.\n5) Understanding what people are googling for when they are looking for products/services like you provide.<p>If you think dissing SEO is taking the high road-- you're half right.  There are ""black-hat"" tricks that you should avoid.  But throwing out SEO as ""meaningless if you have a great product"" isn't taking the high road.  It's taking the stupid road.",1179943126

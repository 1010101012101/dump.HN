I've been working with the GIMP and Inkscape for a good long while, off and on, and I'm still finding Photoshop and Illustrator to be <i>incredibly</i> hard to use and obtuse.  I've been watching video tutorials, reading the docs, searching the web, and tinkering, for a couple of weeks now, and I'm still nowhere <i>near</i> as productive as I am in GIMP or Inkscape.  Partly this is just that the Adobe products do more.  This is an acceptable cost, to me, but I still find myself feeling grouchy a lot of the time because things do not work as I would expect (not just ""as the GIMP or Inkscape would do it"", but also in terms of discoverability...for example, sometimes I accidentally break my workspace, or whatever it is called, and can't figure out what I did or how to fix it; you can't undo workspace changes, as far as I know).<p>Take it all with a grain of salt, as I'm a barely functioning idiot with quite a few products that are supposed to be easy to use.  iTunes, for example, is a nightmare for me; I always end up deleting my whole collection either on the device or on the computer or having something else go totally amok and I have to reboot into Linux just to recover all of my data.  So, maybe Adobe software is ""easy to use"" like Apple software is ""easy to use"", and I'm just an idiot.<p>Stability of the Adobe stuff also leaves a lot to be desired.  It's kinda like Inkscape a couple of years ago, or GIMP ten or twelve years ago (or during the 2.0 beta years).  Sometimes weird things happen and it just freezes up.  This may be the newer Adobe stuff; I'm usually watching a tutorial video when it happens, so maybe Air or Flex or whatever is to blame, rather than Photoshop or Illustrator.  But it happens a <i>lot</i> when I'm watching those videos.",1246390323

I&#x27;ve thought for a while that a libertarian/liberal alliance makes far more sense and could shake the American political system far more effectively than the current structure where the libertarians are unhappy puppets of the Republicans.

I would do something, some kind of job, as would many people. If only for their sense of self worth / self esteem. I believe that almost everyone would get a job even though a basic income means they don&#x27;t have to. Also keep in mind, that no matter what you do, there will ALWAYS be people who refuse to work. You could make unemployment punishable by death, you still wouldn&#x27;t be able to force those people who don&#x27;t want to work to do something. That&#x27;s just the way it is.

Sun made that choice that in hopes they could write a faster GC that way, I suspect.<p>Given that GC design, Go&#x27;s two-word substring references (pointer into middle of string + count) wouldn&#x27;t work; even if String were a builtin, with the no-internal-pointers GC design it would need to be at least three words (pointer to start of string, offset, count).<p>tl;dr of my larger point is--I think Java needed a few extra bytes/String to support substrings by reference because of how its GC works differently from Go&#x27;s, and I think that explains why Java decided to remove its substring-by-reference trick while Go didn&#x27;t.

This is barely enough to get by in someplace like eastern Washington and not enough to get by in someplace like Seattle but it&#x27;s a nice round number so let&#x27;s go with it.<p>The US population is about 300 million. But let&#x27;s assume only adult citizens receive basic income. If you want children you have to provide for them yourself. How many adult US citizens are there? Well, Barack Obama won 51.1% of the popular vote in 2012 with about 66 million votes with 58% turnout. By my calculations that&#x27;s a voting-eligible population of about 220 million.<p>220 million people receiving 12,000 a year is around 2.6 trillion dollars. Total federal tax revenue is around 2.8 trillion dollars, and total expenditures are around 3.5 trillion. You think you can make up the difference by eliminating other entitlements? You can&#x27;t. Look it up. Basic income + defense + transportation already exceeds the current budget, with nothing left over for courts, embassies, Medicare, the space program, or the Coast Guard. And that&#x27;s with a particularly low basic income that isn&#x27;t really enough.<p>So you&#x27;re left with having to raise taxes. Fine, you might say, just tax the rich--except even if you subtract out a lot of entitlements to close the budget gap, including social security, you still have to raise maybe an extra trillion dollars in tax revenue just to keep a comparable deficit.<p>The only way to really make basic income work is if it&#x27;s effectively means tested. One way of doing this might be to say: if you get paid 72,000 a year, your salary drops to 60,000 and the government taxes your employer for the 12,000 that you receive in basic income; either that or you just don&#x27;t receive basic income anymore, it&#x27;s mathematically equivalent. But that is more of a guaranteed minimum income than a basic income anymore, and it&#x27;s politically that much more difficult.",1385574623

After all, the thought of perpetual poverty is a huge motivator<p>It&#x27;s also a catalyst for the kind of lifestyle that quickly stifles further education. As it stands, unskilled, uneducated or partially-educated, non-wealthy individuals often have one realistic option: low-wage, long-hour labor which seems to tend to form a trapping cycle.<p>Now consider for a moment the line of work for (I think it&#x27;s fair to assume) the majority of users of this site (software development) and the nontrivial number of people in the business who are largely self-educated. It would be silly to promote self-education and free-time online learning as an exact analog to accredited institutional education, but this field in particular presents an interesting case study in individuals simply choosing to get educated in a subject and succeed on their own time.<p>Is it likely that a subset of the population would simply settle for the minimum income lifestyle? Of course. But I&#x27;ll wager without a second thought that freeing up a large other portion of the population to pursue their interests will in fact raise the number of educated individuals entering the workforce. After all, the promise of a higher standard of living is still a huge motivator with a basic income of only $10,000/year (still below national poverty level.) And societal attitudes towards the former group are not likely to change -- in fact the sense of tax-dollar ownership is liable to increase stigma on nonworking or nontraining individuals.<p>There are no modern examples of such a system to draw concrete conclusions from, so it&#x27;s all hypothetical in the end.

By that logic LLVM is also a frontend for x86. That doesn&#x27;t mean anything. Asm.js is a platform, LLVM is a compiler, it&#x27;s expected that LLVM can target it asm.js, so can other compilers. Hopefully both asm.js and PNaCl will be targeted by multiple compilers not using LLVM.<p>> <i>It is definitely possible to implement a non LLVM back end for PNaCl.</i><p>Anything&#x27;s possible. Reimplementing PNaCl from scratch (custom everything) obviously will take much more work than implementing it on top of LLVM. However i honestly think that there would be a large chasm between PNaCl on top of LLVM and PNaCl on top of any other virtual machine. And this is a problem.<p>EDIT:<p>I think i&#x27;m too focused on LLVM, sorry about that. What I should have written but didn&#x27;t: PNaCl is hard to reimplement, and not only because it&#x27;s a large project. For example iirc Chrome doesn&#x27;t explicitly support the asm.js pragma and doesn&#x27;t try to be compliant, but it already performs many of the optimizations from the its spec and the Chrome team appears receptive of changes that make this sorta support better. If things continue that way, soon it won&#x27;t matter if Chrome supports the pragma or not. I.e. right now Chrome supports (say) 10% asm.js and eventually it could support up to 90% with no problems. On the other hand can Firefox implement PNaCl piecemally? What would a 10% reimplementation of PNaCl look like? I think even a 90% or anything else short of a full implementation will not be interoperable.",1385574416

In the case of healthcare, governments can get the same coverage and care much cheaper per capita than individuals could if they purchased it on their own.  Giving individuals a basic income does not give them this bargaining power, so doesn&#x27;t that mean that either (a) there will still be a need for social welfare programs for things like healthcare, even with the basic income; or (b) the basic income level must be much higher per capita than what the government would spend on these programs?

If obviously can&#x27;t be reduced to the buying power of $0 in today&#x27;s dollars, because that would require infinite inflation.<p>Let&#x27;s break it down: $68000 annually is $5667/month or $186/day. Let&#x27;s say 20% is intended to go to food: $37/day. That&#x27;s a reasonable amount: for a couple they&#x27;d have to shop and prepare most of their own meals and wouldn&#x27;t eat extravagantly, but they wouldn&#x27;t be eating rice and beans for every meal either.<p>For $37/day to become essentially worthless for the purposes of feeding a couple, I think it&#x27;s buying power would need to drop 66% to 75%. The latter gets you down to $9.25/day, which is rice and beans territory. It&#x27;s still survivable, but you can&#x27;t survive well on it.<p>This couple would still have the equivalent of $17000/year, which is about what one person working full-time at minimum wage would earn. So, if one of them gets a minimum wage job, they&#x27;d be earning as much as two people working minimum wage, while one stays home (perhaps to care for children and avoid the costs of child care.) That&#x27;s already better than the system we have today, where both of them would have to work to earn that much and any children are left to fend for themselves much of the time.<p>If they both get minimum wage jobs, they&#x27;re now earning as much as three minimum wage workers instead of two. Again, much better than today. This keeps one of their teenage children in school instead of joining the minimum wage workforce to help support the family.<p>All this is assuming that the entire economy is hammered by enough inflation to cause a 75% reduction in the earning value of a dollar. Historically, it takes decades for that to happen under normal circumstances, and I don&#x27;t think that changing the way the government spends money that it&#x27;s already spending anyway is likely to cause hyperinflation.",1385573374

A minimum basic income (MBI) is NOT a social progressive concept first thought up by western social democrats but was originally a fundamental tenant of a flat tax system.  Something Libertarian&#x27;s have been arguing in favor of for a long time.<p>The basic design is simple.  You give every person a single dollar amount as a MBI and then ALL income (besides the MBI) is taxed at a flat rate of X percent. For example (and just using simple numbers for maths sake) pretend that the MBI is $10,000 and the tax rate is 10%.  Everyone making LESS than $100,000 would actually receive a subsidy because their overall paid tax would be less than the $10,000 they received from the MBI.  Everyone over $100,000 would pay a progressively higher tax approaching 20%.  The results are:<p>1) A tax rate that is perfectly progressive providing a MBI and fully scaled real tax rate for everyone.\n2) Increased income has no tax disincentives (your tax rate doesn&#x27;t change because you move into a higher income.)\n3) Simplifies that tax code dramatically (which would also increase revenue.)\n4) Doesn&#x27;t artificially encourage capital gains manipulation by large income holders.\n5) Removes government manipulation of social policy by giving them ONLY two number to play with... MBI and tax rate!\n6) Finally, it provides a real mechanism for everybody to feel the effects of tax rate changes.  Making it MORE responsive to economic factors like income inequality. For example, if 90% of people would get more money in their pocket by increasing the MBI to $15,000 while also increasing the tax rate to 30%... the likelihood of that change actually passing through Congress is dramatically higher that it currently is because such a system is transparent to your own pocketbook.<p>ALL of these effects without negatively affecting market freedom.  Again, we see Libertarian thought is both MORE &quot;fair&quot; AND more compassionate.",1385572562

The most powerful computers working together build longer-blockchains (on the average). If a blockchain fork were to happen (again, like back in March: <a href=\"http://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2013-03-11-chain-fork\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2013-03-11-chain-fork</a>), the miners can simply &quot;vote&quot; on which blockchain they want to keep.<p>Non-miners have no say in the matter. The BTC protocol says to trust the longest blockchain, and that is going to stay for the rest of BTC.<p>Thats why I consider the miners to be the governing body of BTC. If Miners wish to build blacklists and stop stolen BTC from going through the network, they can do so. If Miners wish to change the rules of BTC, they can do so (once more than 50% of miners agree... their blockchain will ultimately grow faster than the rest of the miners, which forces the network to conform to their rules).",1385571937

However, it would be great to put a &quot;Top&quot; button somewhere to take the user back or ideally, make the &quot;item&quot; band containing Tablets, PS3, XBox 360... stick to the top.<p>- That brings me to my second point: This type of design is not scalable unless you are planning on supporting only Tablets, PS3s... See what I am saying?<p>- When I first visit your site, I would love to see you auto-detect my location instead of waiting for me to select one. See here for an example: <a href=\"http://html5demos.com/geo\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://html5demos.com/geo</a><p>- Too much space is wasted for each item cell. You can easily have two categories next to each other if the space permits. Think of making it resposive, for instance.<p>- What is the intuition behind the purchase/selling mechanism? Are you designing around some auction schemes? When I want to sell something, it does not ask me for a price. When I want to buy something, it is asking me for a price. So this seems closer to an auction mechanism than any other regular kind of a purchase. Why not explore mechanisms where you can let the seller specify a minimum amount he is willing to accept?

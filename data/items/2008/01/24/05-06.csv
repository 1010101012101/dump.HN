103323,comment,103100,103312,0,0,curi,,,"One of the notable things about those kinds of pictures, is you will see a Palestinian gunmen, in the midst of a crowd of ""innocent bystanders"". If they were so innocent, they'd get the hell away from the crazy, evil man with the gun, so he could be safely shot. Instead they act as human shields.<p>And on the flip side, the gunman is perfectly happy to use them as human shields.",1201154034
103322,comment,103100,103310,0,0,curi,,,"Israel goes to great lengths to avoid killing innocents, even when the innocence of those people is in serious doubt. (e.g., the family of a terrorist, which makes no effort to get out of the way so Israel can kill him without collateral damage, and who gives him comfort, encouragement, and support, is not exactly innocent bystanders)<p>These lengths include:<p>- holding off on killing known terrorist leaders when they have a chance, knowing this puts Israel at greater risk, because they believe the method available to kill him has too high a risk of collateral damage<p>- sending their young men door to door, in very dangerous narrow streets with booby traps, snipers, because getting up close and personal is safer for the Palestinians, though not for the Israelis, who have the power to just bomb the area (which is what most countries would do, like Russia. But in fact, try to name another country which routinely takes similar risks to protect somewhat hostile non-citizens.)",1201153915

103312,comment,103100,103303,0,0,sgoraya,,,"Very much agreed - The nature of the conflict is such that both sides have legitimate arguments I suppose, but in my opinion, the IDF's actions border on war crimes - As a kid watching TV news many many years ago, an indelible image was left with me:<p>A kid with a rock VS. a tank<p>Anyhoo, back to hacking!!",1201152918

But the Palestinian casualties would stop if their insane leadership would stop killing Israelis! Israel is between a rock and a hard place. Nothing they can do is right in the eyes of anyone.<p>I was your typical liberal anti-zionist ""omg the poor Palestians"" Jew until about a month ago. I did the free trip to Israel sponsored by insane wealthy philanthropists and the Israeli government. <a href=""http://www.birthrightisrael.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.birthrightisrael.com</a> (it's free with no catch, other than getting to experience brilliantly constructed propaganda -- they say you need to be Jewish to go along but they don't check. 2/3 of the people on my trip were atheist/secular, kind of like Israel itself. All that matters is that you are 18-26 at the time of the trip. Email me if you're interested in going, I can answer any questions.)<p>My conclusion after the trip is that the Palestinians bring it on themselves. I wish that Israel would stop killing innocents. But if they made radical concessions, like completely removing their military from the occupied territories, tearing down the racist segregation wall, and returning East Jerusalem to Arab control, acts of terrorism would increase.<p>So...   I would love to hear what you or anyone think is the solution to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, keeping in mind that the truly ideal solution, making Jerusalem an international city, will never be agreed upon by the Palestinians.",1201152865

Noam Chomsky, in particular, says some important things (alongside some bizarre things to be sure).  To be honest, I am much less familiar with and sympathetic to polar ultraright opinion.<p>I recommend all of these things.",1201152788

In part because most other investors are going to have different strengths, different criteria, and a much different investment strategy and engagement model.<p>YC might support a ""franchise model"" based on location if they could qualify other investment teams that could take advantage of their model. But a lot of the attraction may have less to with methodology and process and more to do with the specific expertise and connections of YC's founders.",1201152278

480526,comment,480171,480313,0,0,unalone,,,"If you're running for election I'm guessing you're old-ish? (From the point of an 18-year-old, where old-ish is 28+?) In high school I worked with a bunch of teachers on Internet-related stuff, and I found that there's a disconnect in how people across the gap view privacy.<p>For people 18 year old and younger, there's never not been an Internet. When I was 8 I had already been told a bunch of  horrifying ""keep your security"" stories. I was probably younger than 15 when I first heard about sites like 4chan terrorizing people for years on-end. The result, though, isn't that you hide yourself (which is the reaction I see in my father especially). It's that you decide exactly how you'll let yourself be seen online, you avoid things that'll get you in trouble, and you don't take the Internet too seriously. Most harassment things won't happen if you sound reasonable, don't botch up spelling, avoid fanfiction, and don't actively taunt Anonymous. Similarly, a lot of stuff online is less serious than you can let yourself believe: if you get threatening calls, they almost never mean a thing. People troll. It's easy, and it's become a part of society.<p>In the end, the sheer <i>amount</i> of information means that almost nobody gets targeted. You're a small bubble in a vast ocean. We young brats see it like that, anyway: now, everything is considered public information but still under your control. (I was called into a teacher's office for something I said on Facebook: I said that it was my private space, that the teacher had no right accessing my information, and that the person who took my stuff off of Facebook was violating terms and against the law. She couldn't do anything after that.) So it doesn't become a matter of privacy or not: it becomes a matter of just what is most public.<p>I agree with you about Twitter, though. Constraints aren't particularly useful in its case.",1234563147

Sternberg has gone on to become quite a well informed critic of IQ tests, although he still attempts to develop easy to administer mental tests to measure intelligence according to his triarchic theory of intelligence.

(In fact, Cambodia is almost uniquely bad in the history of the world, as far as I know; there are lots of instances of conquering armies killing 50% or 100% of a conquered people, but I don't know of any others where they killed more than 50% of <i>their own population</i>.)<p>In both Cambodia and Vietnam, the civil war was made much worse by a US invasion.  Maybe you think the same thing would have happened to Singapore?  I suspect that they had an equal chance of ending up like Thailand, or urban Malaysia, or other countries in the area; and it's not clear to me that aggressively persecuting Communists made a civil war less rather than more likely.",1234562493

So, case in point, I come here to get in debates. I use Tumblr to store my ideas (I don't follow other users, and I've tried to disable the following count so I'm not influenced by my far-too-many followers). But for Twitter, I see it as ""I'm here to talk for the sake of talking."" I don't get it. As it is, now that my Twitter shows my Tumblr posts, I've been slowly picking up Twitter followers, and it baffles me. I follow people using RSS, and I've asked before to allow HN to give me a ""new replies"" RSS feed so I can centralize everything (and internally, versus on an open field like FriendFeed). I'm horrified at the thought of adding yet another outlet to post links and say random things - there're too many already.<p>It's a shame because I like how minimal Twitter is. It's zen in a way. I just don't see the point to having one and keeping it: one site is enough, and my poison is Tumblr.",1234562412

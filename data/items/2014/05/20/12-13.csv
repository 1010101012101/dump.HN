Now I really want to get a Rubik&#x27;s TouchCube and port this to it.<p>EDIT:\nYou could extrapolate this idea to different geometric shapes too, to achieve unconventional time-signiatures. Of course this would also limit/increase the number of of beat samples, too.<p>Pyramid would be 6/8 or 6/4 with only 4 samples, whereas dodecahedron would be 5/4 or 10/8 with 12 samples. That could be fun. Using the center as a beat as well could give 9/8, 7/8 and 11/8 for pyramid, cube and dodecahedron respectively.",1400590782

StackOverflow requires that you have 50pts of rep to be able to leave a comment on someones question.<p>So for example. John Smith has posted a question about a PHP error:<p>&quot;Hey guys, i&#x27;m getting an unspecified variable error on line 66, can you help me?&quot;<p>To which my comment would be:<p>&quot;Could you please post the some code?&quot;<p>However, having less then 50pts makes this impossible. I then have to leave it as an answer, which not only seems to anger everybody on SO for not being a proper answer but also isn&#x27;t what an answer section is used for.<p>So, What are you thoughts about this process?

Nearly everyone below the line on the post is a Linux refugee that&#x27;s pitched up on a Mac. Here, not so much.<p>For my part, I have always had a deeply-rooted and entirely irrational hatred of Apple products. OK, the retina screens are nice. Trackpads are usable - but I hate trackpads anyway and always carry a proper mouse around, so no win there. (What happened to those little joystick-type thingies that used to stick out of laptop keyboards, anyway? I liked them.)<p>But I&#x27;m just about old enough to have mostly owned and used desktop PCs. And those desktop PCs have all been custom builds. I&#x27;m typing this on a slightly ramshackle Lenovo laptop, which is obviously not a custom build - but I can take the back off it and fool around if I so choose. I&#x27;ve never used particularly outre specialist components or anything; but in some fundamentally irrational way, having, <i>in principle</i>, an absolute say so on what&#x27;s inside my computer is important to me. Apple&#x27;s entire business model is antithetical to that. And while I see plenty of satisfied Apple customers among my friends and family, I also see them forking out endless money to Apple support for trivial fixes because of it.<p>(And I won&#x27;t be buying Lenovo again, because I do not expect my BIOS to be password protected, and not be provided with the password. :-) )",1400590613

I don&#x27;t want to go back to using two computers and OSX is _much_ better at everyday non-developer stuff than any Linux I&#x27;ve ever used so I make do with bad package managers and random compilation issues.<p>Pray god that I never have to wipe my hard drive though.

Why not cut through the bullshit and make airlines into competing cooperatives chartered by the government? Or some other structure that is not a charade covering what amounts to a skimming of subsidies into investors&#x27;, or in this case pilots&#x27;, pockets or outright rescue of investors from a situation of their own making?<p>The situation is inherently corrupting. The only way to win is to tilt the flow of subsidies in your direction. In this case the senior pilots win because they institutionalized their levers of power.<p>Many people here fantasize about a libertarian approach to problems like this.

Almost as though they can chase through situations quicker and come up with possible (bad) results that give them reason to worry. It kinda plays into that ignorance is bliss mantra, but that's just my experience.<p>My mother is a frantic worrier and pretty intelligent IMO. I have a tendency towards worrying but when my mind dwells on negative situations I try to practice considering what the good outcomes might be or indeed to go overboard and consider the most outrageously impossible worst outcome.<p>I read about this technique from a link here a couple of years ago I think, it helps a little. One can spirally negatively with thoughts of possible scenarios very readily and when I remember this is a useful check on that.<p>Couldn't find the link, it's a common technique to teach in cognitive behaviour therapy, like <a href=""http://us.reachout.com/the_facts/fs_factsheet.php?s=05&f=28"" rel=""nofollow"">http://us.reachout.com/the_facts/fs_factsheet.php?s=05&f...</a>.",1291992614

He was considered ""dumb"" - writing this now sounds like people around him were assholes, which isn't the case; we were indeed all friends. He did score poorer grades than the rest, and had severe mood-swings.<p>A few months ago, he decided to stop smoking pot. I cannot begin to tell you how different things felt. His performance has apparently increased dramatically (to the point where he's now over the group average) and the mood swings are gone. Interestingly, the mood didn't improve for the better and he might be going through depression. But despite the psychological downturn (which may have other causes), his cognitive abilities have noticeably improved.<p>Again, I'm no doctor, so I can't say for sure whether the two things (stop smoking pot <-> better mental performance) are connected. But as with most people, my gut tells me it is. Just thinking about the people I know who smoke every day, I realize that my expectations for them are lower.

I guess it's because I find it a little hypocritical...he invariable downplays things like this (as he does in the Press Release) by saying ""anyone could have done this, it takes no skill at all....""<p>The problem is he's always saying stuff like ""you don't need skill to be a hacker, you just need the hacker spirit""...the hacker spirit being a sort of inquisitive, industrious, and mischevious nature.<p>2600 Magazine presents all manner of simple and no-skill-needed activities as ""hacking"", so please forgive my bemusement...<p>It's also funny that it seems like a lot of his associates don't feel the same way... there are occasionally embarrassed silences on Off The Hook when Emannual goes on about how some incident he doesn't approve of ""isn't hacking"".<p>It seems to me what Emmanual really wants to do is impose arbitrary (though possibly agreeable) moral restrictions on what ""hacking"" is, and simply changes the definition to suit that without having to admit it.<p>If I'm a little sarcastic, it's because I truly believe this is counter-productive and will backfire.<p>Emmanuel will say ""this takes no skill at all, anyone can do it"".<p>John Q Public and Suzy Cream-cheese will think ""<i>I</i> sure as heck dunno how to do this....it's pretty impressive to me"". Meanwhile Emmanual tries to slap down any attempt to distinguish between ethical hackers and the ""blackhats"".<p>...""Why do we need that?"" he'll say...""We already have a word: 'criminals'"".<p>Well....because there clearly is a phenomenon in need of a description here....and ""computer criminals"" doesn't have quite as nice a ring and isn't as descriptive. Nobody complains we don't need the word ""pick-pocket"" because we can just call them ""criminals""....<p>I think it's a losing battle.<p>Emmanual is bolstering (through implication) the opinion that ""any complicated trick is hacking""...and his assurances that this is simple are discarded by people who consider it magical.<p>Meanwhile, he gives them no alternatives...it's ""hackers"" or nothing....so of course they go with ""hackers"".<p>Personally, I'm happy if they just qualify it with something like ""black-hat hackers""...<p>Overall I'm inclined to agree that these shenanigans are likely unproductive, not difficult to do, and hard to support ethically....still, I think it's fair to say they fit the rather liberal rubric 2600 generally uses to judge what constitutes ""hacking"" or at least what belongs in a ""hacking magazine"".",1291991641

First of all, UN delegates were not duped by college students into banning water. They were duped into signing a petition to ban water. It might have been irresponsible of them to leave their signature on a piece of paper without thinking it through, but it's a far cry from being ""duped into banning water"".<p>That leads me to my second point: they are UN <i>delegates</i>. They're not geeks, they're more like managers. They'll have experts whom they'll consult. They won't stop to try and puzzle out ""dihydrogen monoxide"" when approached by obviously unofficial and (within the context) unimportant people. As a matter of fact, given their job, they're probably used to being approached by people ranging from genuine, serious activists to plain loonies.<p>Like I said, if you're an official decision maker, it's not very responsible to appear to endorse someone else's idea without researching it properly, but that's as far as this whole issue goes.",1291990947

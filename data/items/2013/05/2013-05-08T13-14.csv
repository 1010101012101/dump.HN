Took about half a day each time. I've reinstalled everything once in 4 years on Mac OS, from Time Machine, so I just left it running overnight. I don't know how long it actually took but I got up the next day to find my computer just as it was. Reinstalling things is annoying, but just doesn't take up enough of my time to be a problem worth fixing.<p>Then again, maybe if I had the ability to quickly set up a new development-ready VM, I'd come to find all sorts of unexpected uses for it? I've certainly found duplicating Parallels VMs handy a couple of times.

But most of the troubles you outline, I feel you're ""doing it wrong"" or are actually flat wrong about how it works.  This may be a training issue Apple should address.<p>As just one example, I very specifically want my device camera roll and combined photo stream separate.  Combining them as you suggest has severely negative consequences your article doesn't consider.  Edits on iOS carry over to desktop, you can edit on the loo all day if that suits your style.  You never ever have to delete photos from your photo stream and no Apple dialog tells you to delete from photostream.  If you set prefs right, you'll get photos imported exactly once.<p>Your letter raises awareness that people like photos. That's good.<p>But while waiting, look into some of the prefs dialogs in Aperture or iPhoto. I'm comfortable that every need you mentioned is handled.<p>But if you still can't find satisfaction for your particular workflow (e.g. photo pro doing commercial work in studio and on laptop in field), check out Image Capture plus the lesser known Auto Importer scriptable tool. You may have to mindlessly plug in a cable after a shoot or at least once in 30 days, but you won't have to press a key.",1368021430

They both have nearly identical core features.  Both can grab cookbooks from the Chef community site, local path, generic Git repository (which includes getting a single cookbook from a subdir) or Github.  Their syntax is nearly identical.  The only difference that I can think of is that Berkshelf has pessimistic version matching support (a la Bundler), while I'm not sure that librarian-chef does.<p>Where they differ is in where they put your cookbooks, and what additional features they offer.  Librarian-chef puts your cookbooks in a ""cookbooks"" folder in the project root, while Berkshelf keeps a global cache of all the versions of each cookbook you've installed outside of the project.  Both provide support for uploading your cookbooks to a Chef server, librarian-chef through plain knife and Berkshelf through it's own upload command.<p>Berkshelf also features scaffolding support for Vagrantfiles and new cookbooks, and generally has extra features specifically for rapidly iterating on cookbooks themselves.  It also provides a vagrant plugin to manage bundling/uploading cookbooks to a Vagrant VM, since they need to be copied out of the central repo and made available.<p>Overall, I've found that I like Berkshelf better.  It feels a little more idiomatic, and I like having my cookbook versions shared between projects rather than duplicated everywhere.

    James Montaldi, Katrina Steckles
    (Submitted on 2 May 2013)

    Since the foundational work of Chenciner and Montgomery in 2000 there
    has been a great deal of interest in choreographic solutions of the
    n-body problem: periodic motions where the n bodies all follow one
    another at regular intervals along a closed path. The principal approach
    combines variational methods with symmetry properties. In this paper, we
    give a systematic treatment of the symmetry aspect. In the first part we
    classify all possible symmetry groups of planar n-body, collision-free
    choreographies. These symmetry groups fall in to 2 infinite families and,
    if n is odd, three exceptional groups. In the second part we develop the
    equivariant fundamental group and use it to determine the topology of the
    space of loops with a given symmetry, which we show is related to certain
    cosets of the pure braid group in the full braid group, and to centralizers
    of elements of the corresponding coset.</code></pre>",1368020498

Occasionally there is skepticism, but generally, it's viewed positively.<p>However, what many OSS apps lack is a backing company to engage for support.  A scenario, if you will:<p>I am the CTO of a federal agency, and I am looking to cut costs over the long run and replace an aging legacy system.  I see that OSS_APP_A is a direct drop-in with minimal switching costs, however, OSS_APP_A has no 'RedHat, Inc' behind it.  OSS_APP_B however, doesn't appear to be quite as fully featured, and would probably require contracting time to fully switch over, which we can hire 'OSS_APP_B, Inc' to do.  If it breaks, we can call 'OSS_APP_B, Inc', and we can hire them to do the work.  Also, if it fails, we can blame them and get out of paying on the contract until such time it is fixed.<p>Open source is nice, but in government, generally, systems are more critical than others.  Swapping out their office suite to OpenOffice is probably a no-brainer, but swapping out Microsoft IIS for Apache is a little scarier, because what happens if it breaks?   So they don't use Apache, they instead hire a company like Covalent which offers a little value-add on top of Apache, but basically, they're ""someone to blame"" if/when it doesn't work.<p>If there's a particular piece of software you'd like to push, and it doesn't have some kind of formal backing, you might consider that a business opportunity.

I do a lot of low-traffic webapps and never really felt like I did much trade-off with premature optimization.  It certainly sounded strong to say that pre-mature optimization was the root of <i>all evil</i>.  Hell, I messed up so many other things that I would have picked any one of them and thought it to be more of a problem.  But I respected the person saying it, so I kept it in the back of my mind.<p>Then I had an epiphany.  Pre-mature optimization isn't just about performance, and it doesn't even have to be about only programming.  In your business, are you focusing on automating something that will only save a miniscule amount of time?  Are you building a feature that will rarely ever be used?  Sounds like pre-mature optimization to me.  And the problem is not that the end-product won't be better; the problem is the opportunity cost.  You're trading off a whole host of other things that could be worked on instead.<p>Pre-mature optimization for me comes down to reassessing where I am at every stage of building a project and asking myself: am I focused on the right thing?  Because if not, I'm wasting my time.",1368018848

Javascript was a perfectly good language to begin with, Coffeescript just made it shorter and with a bit different syntax here and there and with a feature or two for handling closures better. Not bad, surely, but not really that great either. My experience working in Coffeescript so far has been that it's still important to understand the javascript it's going to be translated into, to understand the subtleties of closures and scope as they're implemented in coffeescript.<p>Why, then, use coffeescript? It's so much clearer for me to simply see that an anonymous function is being defined to pass this scope and do this yada yada, and while longer, I much prefer that over a language that hides the true meaning in an attempt to reach some sort of syntax simplicity that doesn't really have that big an effect in the end. It's not a protection of an investment, it's that I can't imagine ever being able to use or understand Coffeescript without <i>also</i> having an expert grasp on Javascript. I don't know of anyone who knows Coffeescript on its own. You still need to understand what it's doing, fundamentally; or at least, it's useful to; or failing that, it's <i>right</i> to understand it.<p>I don't know if I want a developer who knows only Coffeescript. I don't want someone who doesn't understand what it's being compiled into. Frankly, the same goes for other languages: you really should understand what assembly fundamentally does, and how your IF statements and loops are translated. It makes a ton of sense that we don't write our code in ASM these days, but for Javascript it just seems lazy. Javascript is a perfectly serviceable extremely high-level language. It's not that hard to learn or to work in, and if you know it well, it's actually quite nice and has many interesting features. Coffeescript, as a rejection of Javascript, makes little sense to me because Javascript just isn't that bad.<p>However, Coffeescript as a response to wanting another language on the web; wanting a slightly clearer syntax for writing asynchronous callbacks and classes and whatnotsure, that makes some sense. It just still feels dirty. At its most basic level it just feels like a lazy hack, because it's layered on top of this other perfectly useful high-level language that might be 50% more lines of code, but would work perfectly fine.<p>What it really means is that the browser is the new CPU and Javascript is the new machine code. It's just another layer of abstraction. In the end, I don't like it because Javascript is just not that hard. I imagine this is echoing the arguments of C die-hards upon the advent of newer, higher-level languages. It all makes sense, but sometimes it's hard to swallow.",1368018124

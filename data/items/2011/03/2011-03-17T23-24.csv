Do you have any idea how often the topic of the difficulty of hiring women comes up when I talk to fellow entrepreneurs (male and female)? Personally, I've tried recruiting six talented female programmers to apply to Y Combinator. None have. Two of them took jobs at Goldman Sachs. One of them was one of the most talented programmers I've ever met.<p>If you want to change the game, you've got to get in it. The fact of the matter is that VC is an institution that's incredibly biased against anyone who doesn't have connections. The year before I went through Y Combinator, I emailed 30 VCs our pitch deck. Two responded. The day after demo day, we had offers for meetings with half. Today, I have no trouble setting up meetings. VCs simply don't have time to review every company that might come their way. So they use intros and recommendations as short cuts. This isn't actually a male or female issue. Very few people have the requisite connections to break into this group. Isolating it to a female issue alone probably minimizes the seriousness of the problem. That's why I love when a VC like Bryce reaches out and gives people a way to even get in the door without having said connections. This is a huge improvement for those willing to take advantage of it.<p>Seriously, I'm open to suggestions. What solutions do you have that would get more women into the game? We both agree that it would be a good thing.",1300405605

Syncing data between the iPad and a computer (photos, books, music, etc) is optional at this point. In the future I assume backups/software updates will not require a computer either but it is a challenge to backup 16/32/64GB to the cloud on a regular basis for most people with mediocre broadband connections and basically impossible over 3G due to data caps/throttling. I guess if we want to stick with the microwave analogy we could say the microwave cannot be activated before being plugged into an electrical socket. It's a practical consideration. We could have microwaves that ran on batteries but what's the point? If you own a microwave you probably have a spot to plug it in. If you own an iPad you probably have a computer of some kind.

What do success and failure entail, and what are their implications for your career? The attraction of the get-rich-or-die-quickly company is that, if it doesn't make you rich enough never to have to work again, at least you can walk away from it and hopefully spin your story positively enough to get career credit, for your next job, for the time you spent there.<p>Taking VC and making $120k/year, which is low-average for a VC-funded firm's CEO, and then failing after three years, doesn't entail much financial loss. And unless the failure is catastrophic and obviously reflects badly on a single founder, it's not a huge career hit. Sure, it's 3 years working very hard for middling pay, but there are worse things in the world. Depending on how one is able to bounce back from the failure, it may have been 3 years very well spent.<p>As for lifestyle businesses, no VC is going to fund a lifestyle business; it's just not what they do. And bank loans are out because they make onerous personal-liability requirements, so scratch that. This leaves two options. (1) Don't quit your day job. Risk is minimal, but I'd be shocked if more than 2% of these also-employed ""entrepreneurs"" take off. (2) Quit your day job, and put personal savings at risk. This is a lot riskier, financially, than founding a VC startup if you have sufficient social connections to know (before you start) that you'll be funded. That doesn't mean it's not worth doing, and if you don't have those social connections you'll be eating savings either way while you hunt for funding, but it does mean that it's costly.",1300404677

It then goes on to suggest that applications which use Android's NDK could be declared GPLed if there is a successful challenge to Android's cleaning of header files. This seems far-fetched. Let's work it through. First, Google would have to acknowledge that its headers were GPLed. Presumably this would involve a court case. Brought by who? And on what grounds? Then, somebody, perhaps the winner of the court case, would have to get the application developer to acknowledge that their application was GPLed. This would presumably be another court case. Again, brought by who, and on what grounds? Assuming you did go through these heroic and precedent-setting court cases, you would end up with the source code to a shared library, and you would have to go through it all again to get access to the Java code or other application components which are executed by interpreters. The whole piece reads like Slashdot-esque fear-mongering.<p>The article then goes on to suggest that Google has ""unlocked the kernel from the restrictions of GPL2"" and could ""create a non-GPL'd fork of the Linux kernel"".

I have zero comment on that (mainly because I'm disinterested in the subject).<p>My only comment is on home-screen web apps, which are 100% equivalent to opening the page on your browser. They deserve <i>more</i> privileges because the user had to make a decision to install them. It makes no sense to me whatsoever that a random <i>advertisement</i> loaded from some insecure URL on a web page is allowed to access Nitro and web cache, but a web app that I trust enough to install on my home screen is not.<p>Ironically, I'm actually pretty happy with this decision, because I believe all apps <i>should</i> be in the browser. I'm just telling it like it is when people make nonsensical arguments.",1300403363

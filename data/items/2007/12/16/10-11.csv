As a non-technical article I don't entirely trust it, but it does seem like there is a way to extract energy from the ocean floor while safely and permanently storing our CO2 below the ocean floor.",1197802447
90085,comment,89945,90035,0,0,jey,,,"Well, if it's written in C, it can be used pretty much anywhere and linked to from pretty much anything. Yes, the code needs to be written portably, but that's a solved problem.<p>In addition to that, the FSF has some weird religious adherence to C that goes beyond linkability. e.g. they're opposed to libraries being written in highly portable C++ which export their bindings in pure C, even if you only used features supported by Cfront in 1990.",1197802107

90073,story,,,6,3,dfranke,"Ask YC: Including source code with commercial software",,"So, if any of you are wondering where I've disappeared to, I quit my\njob last week, so now I actually have work to do :-).  I'm going sans\npartner and sans investors on a subset of the idea from my YC\napplication.  The original idea was a web service targeted at\ndevelopers, but I later realized that what I thought of as\ndown-the-road functionality of the web service would actually work\nwell as a standalone program for the desktop.  It's sufficiently\nlimited in scope that I can make something feature-complete long\nbefore my savings run out.  So, the plan is to work full time until I get to a release, and\nthen get a new job and maintain this on the side.  If it's sufficiently\nsuccessful, I get back together with my partner and use the cash flow\nand the resume boost to jumpstart the original idea.<p>I'm going with a freemium licensing model: this is a database tool, and\nit'll be free for use with sufficiently small databases; use with larger\nones carries a per-seat fee.<p>Anyhow: I'm giving consideration using a Minix-style license.\nI.e., the program includes source code, which you're permitted to\nmodify and distribute patches against.  This would essentially result\nin free users being on the honor system not to subvert the\ndatabase-size check.  There are a number of reasons that I'm considering\ndoing this:<p>- Given that I expect a fairly sophisticated user base, anyone\n  determined to circumvent the size restriction is likely going to\n  succeed whether or not they get the source.<p>- The program is written in Haskell and has several dependencies\n  licensed under the LGPL.  Due to some GHC implementation details\n  involving static linking and intermodule optimization, binary-only\n  programs that use LGPL code are rather dubiously in compliance.\n  With some work I could get around this, and I realize the chances of\n  getting sued over such a thing are infinitesimal, but the necessary\n  accomodations would be annoying and I'd feel bad about not making\n  them.<p>- Although the idea behind the program is novel AFAIK, no part of what\n  it does is especially magical, so I don't place much value on any\n  trade secrets.<p>- It means that I get to crowdsource a lot of my technical support and\n  bug-fixing.<p>- People will be less hesitant about using software from a small vendor\n  for potentially mission-critical work if they know that they can\n  do their own maintenance if necessary.<p>- There's a decent-sized community that gets excited about Haskell being\n  used successfully in industry.  Letting them see the source may turn\n  some of them into customers and/or advocates.  (Much as practically\n  everyone in the Haskell community uses darcs rather than git or bzr\n  even though the three are pretty much functionally identical.)<p>So, what are everyone's thoughts on this?  Am I out of my mind for\nthinking about this?  Any major pitfalls I'm overlooking?",1197800581

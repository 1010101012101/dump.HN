592100,comment,590608,590608,0,0,rksprst,,,"I'm getting a Kindle 2 in a few days. Why? I love reading but don't have the time to go to the bookstore or library. I've finished a couple of books on my iPhone Kindle app and want the real Kindle since (1) it's getting hard to read on the iPhone screen (2) you can't ""buy"" the books from the iPhone Kindle app (you have to visit the website, or use the amazon.com iphone app) and (3) there are a ton of free books that I like and because I read a lot, I might actually save money with the Kindle.",1241423732

Wasn't there a case where a tethering app was pulled out by Google from Market due to telco pressure?<p>Of course being Android, with a few more steps, you can add an alternative ""market place"". But that's besides the point, it is not completely open even though it claims to be.<p>At the moment, no, experience-wise for the <i>consumer</i>, it is almost always worse than the iPhone.<p>And yes, I have both phones.",1241423503
592096,comment,591508,591508,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"That if you're looking to raise funding, being an LLC will be a continued point of annoyance that will become worse as the level of funding rises. You'll be forced to convert to an S corp as soon as any experienced angels or VCs become involved beause they simply won't do deals with you otherwise - which can be a big headache, legal expense, and drain on time.",1241423399

As the Lisp compilers improve in the code that they generate over the coming years the gap will close without much work on the Lisp hacker's part.</i><p>Conclusion: [some banality]<p>Now, pretend I had written the above more eloquently and inefficiently, and I'll pretend Safari didn't die.

Methinks Apple needs better screening and performance evaluation of their app store employees. All it takes is a few jackasses in the mix for this to happen. Their rejection policy clearly leaves certain things open for interpretation.",1241423117

592089,comment,591068,591256,0,0,sketerpot,,,"That would be <i>awesome!</i> The juxtaposition of the modern and the archaic is artistically interesting. It would be a glimpse at how things used to be, accompanied by a reminder of how much things have changed, and it might let people feel the passage of time on an emotional level. I would love to see this hypothetical old 'here there be darkies' map on Google Earth.",1241422830
592088,comment,590922,590922,0,0,neilk,,,"I wish you well, and I don't think your plan is totally crazy, but I think $3K is not enough runway for SF. $5K is better. But at $3K, everything has to go right. A single disaster would ruin everything, like:<p>- Your freelance gigs not paying you in time\n- Finding that your new roommates are impossible to live with\n- Getting tossed out of your new place when your housemate wants his girlfriend to move in\n- Some unexpected expense (car accident, hospital visit)<p>Also, you will not believe what some people are offering for those $700/month apartments. On Craigslist at that price, you might find generally terrible places with sketchy roommates and your ""room"" may literally be a former closet. Believe me, I have seen them. I am very frugal about rent so I have investigated those sorts of listings. There are $700/month rooms that are halfway decent but those don't tend to pop up on Craigslist. Working your friend network in SF might be the best option.<p>And, your estimates of expenses are too low.<p>Still, if you are looking to just break even, it might be worth a try. Just be prepared to go home or try to get a parental loan (if that's possible) if it doesn't work out.<p>Ditto on the false economy of living in the peninsula. Unless you are trying to get a job at one of the Palo Alto or Mountain View area startups.<p>There are a lot of cool things going on in Oakland so I would consider that as a possibility, but it's also more complex for a newcomer to figure out a decent place to live, and transit is considerably more expensive.",1241422731

They used to be 2% + $0.20 which was phenomenal, but they've increased them to a tiered pricing that isn't as competitive for smaller merchants.<p>I wonder if Google is realizing they can't offer such great deals anymore.

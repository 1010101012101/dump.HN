The whole point of dumping all these things out of your brain and into the system is so that you can let go off all that because you know it&#x27;s in the system and the system works. If you&#x27;re still fretting over the list of stuff then you probably don&#x27;t trust the system. The most likely causes of distrust are 1) you haven&#x27;t had enough chance to see it working, or 2) you haven&#x27;t implemented/adapted the system correctly <i>for you</i> and the system <i>really, actually isn&#x27;t working</i>.

Technology developed in the 1980&#x27;s and 1990&#x27;s has found many new applications, because of the Internet, but fundamental systems haven&#x27;t improved much. In the professions, the increases in efficiency from 1995 to 2000 were more significant than from 2000 to 2015. Even Moore&#x27;s law has slowed dramatically in the last 15 years.<p>And the government and guild protections are fictions. I work at a small boutique that would love to be able to take bigger cases away from big white shoe firms by leveraging technology. We&#x27;re not going to leave money on the table right now because of some abstract loyalty to the &quot;guild.&quot; If the technology existed, we would use it. So would everyone else.

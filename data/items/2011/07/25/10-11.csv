The idea was that it could start for stuff like Christmas presents and perhaps one day morph out to be a generic receiving service for small businesses.<p>Fun little project. The stretch goals were writing my first app in F#/Unbuntu/AWS, so it's not like the effort was wasted. I find the best thing to do with any project is to have a solid set of secondary goals that you can reach no matter how the original project turns out. (I've also found out that it's critical to keep projects small.)",1311591537

The fact that you can use more than language, doesn't mean you have to use languages or language extensions you are not familiar with. I'm not certain, why this should be a problem. If there is a syntax package you'd like to try, there is inevitably some learning required, similarly as with the new libraries.<p>2)<p>Well, you are right, both the problems and benefits of operator overloading are present. Still, as a C++ programmer, in many cases, the benefits far outweight the price (especially with smart pointers). Also, like with C++ operators, to see how the notation operates, you can just check out the code. But I have to admit, that the ability to define & extend syntax comes with a great responsibility. I'd still see situations, where the mechanism would be useful.<p>3)\nIt is possible to have generic expressions, that take parameters. E.g. let's imagine, that we have some extendable core language set (e.g. my.glang) and several extendable extensions to it (e.g. my.ipc.glang, my.sql.glang).<p>In current code, to glue it all together you can do<p>exp glued =\nmy.sql.glang(glued)|my.ipc.glang(glued)|my.glang(glued);<p>Even more, you can make even that extendable:<p>exp gglued(ext) = \next|my.sql.glang(glued)|my.ipc.glang(glued)|my.glang(glued);<p>4)\nWell, in previous example, one automatically will set priority between languages. So, if the sql syntax uses some foobar@zap syntax, while the mt library uses the same, the sql syntax will be chosen. Still, ofc. this kind of hiding of expressions have its own problems, and I believe that the only real way to manage such issues is with careful language & extension design. Still ofc. if there are syntax packages from two different parties, syntax clashes may result. Still, as the syntax definitions tend to be highly modular, even in such cases you may be in position to create your own coherent language package by cherry picking some syntax from here and there.",1311589563

It might have gone missing.<p>Recently a friend noticed a charge on his credit card statement. ""Flipcode Ltd"" was not a familiar name. A little googling later, it appears Flipcode is the company behind HiddenApp. They had a promo around Christmas 2010 where you could get the app for free, and enjoyed viral fame when someone liveblogged the hunt for their stolen Mac.<p>Worryingly, HiddenApp appears to have fallen off the radar. They don't have a contact page, but the Privacy page includes a business name and phone number. Sadly for my friend, the phone rings off. The postal address is a PO Box, which though not uncommon, doesn't help us locate them. A Companies House lookup reveals only the address of their online accountants. This wouldn't in and of itself be worrying, unless you needed to get hold of them.<p>There has been no response, automatic or otherwise, to emails in over a week. The website copyright footer says 2010. The more you let your imagination run away with you, the worse the situation looks. With no blog posts in almost two months, and no activity on Twitter since June 1st (which mentions an address in Watford, UK), @replies have gone unanswered. It's hard to identify any company activity in the support forum.<p>Whilst HiddenApp may well be alive and well (it seems to function OK), you have to wonder whether it's safe to use a service that itself has gone incognito. Had we not investigated, we might not have discovered the inactivity until it was too late. Indeed, does it even work with Lion?<p>If security is freedom from care, anxiety or doubt, right now there's enough cause for concern to move away from HiddenApp. Has anyone heard from Flipcode?

If, say, the system was 10% efficient at producing power directly and put 25% into heat reserves which are 80% efficient at releasing that heat and turing it into power, then yes, the bottom would, excepting rare cases (strange weather?), be warmer than the top.<p>I don't believe that is the case for two hand-waving reasons. The desert in northern New Mexico (where I lived) gets a thermal inversions. You can see that smoke from morning fires rises, hits the inversion layer, and goes horizontal. I believe this is common in deserts, at least those with mountains. From <a href=""http://www.srh.noaa.gov/media/abq/LocalStudies/ABQthermalinversions2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.srh.noaa.gov/media/abq/LocalStudies/ABQthermalinv...</a> there's an 5.8C difference for shallow (~155m thick) inversions, which occurs throughout the year, and there were ""130 inversion cases"" in that year. Thus, the ""1 degree per 100 meters"" rule of thumb only applies during the day. A power system would have to work against the inversion.<p>Second, power extraction is more efficient with higher differentials. It would, I believe, be better to extract more power during the day (when the difference is high and demand for cooling is also high) than to store it for energy production at night.<p>The previous comment proposed the ""capacity to be much nearer to 100% than the opposite.""

Besides the author is doing things in a pretty safe way by getting to know people over the internet and with Skype first. FUD and attempts to build a fortress around yourself are actually dangerous.<p>Even if you dont agree with me. I just prefer to live this way: I prefer to believe its better to connect with people; I prefer confidence to shy timidness; I prefer to look enthusiastic when meeting a new person over fearful judgment.

I've seen people lean too heavily on them, or not heavily enough. The biggest problem I've seen, particularly common in the Java world due to jMock's datedness, is over specifying expectations on mocks.

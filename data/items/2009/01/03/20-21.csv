If you don't like the RIAA, but you like their music, you don't have a <i>right</i> to their music by virtue of the fact that you simply <i>want</i> it.<p>This my beef with the comments.  Regardless of the legality of it, redistributing an artists' work without their approval.<p>Piracy is wrong, whether it's software or music.  But a site like ""TorrentFreak"" is certainly going to be crawling with people who have absolutely no respect for property rights.<p>A service like Spotify (with agreements with the record companies) is offering the music in a free-as-in-beer streaming service, which, although they're not MP3s, they are still free music in a much more highly customized format than radio broadcast (and even web listening services like last.fm), and that's a sign that the RIAA is at least willing to support modern services.<p>But the pirates on TorrentFreak remain vehemently opposed to the free music on Spotify simply because they took the legal route of <i>working with the content producers</i>.<p>This is why I am appalled (though not terriby surprised) by the comments on the article.",1231015093

Instead, it was supposed to be a metaphor for all supernatural claims.  In particular, Sagan had previously spent a large amount of time in the earlier parts of the book discussing claims of alien abductions, and relating them to historical cases of ""demonic possession"".  While this story can certainly be used as a metaphor for God, I believe that focusing on that misses the overall point of the story.",1231014608

First of all, here (Phoenix) the market is very full of the ""I program because it pays the bills"" sort, and when we do a posting we review hundreds of candidates (either who directly contact us or are sent to us). Of those hundreds, I'll talk to probably 30 to 50. Of that 30 to 50, maybe 5 or 6 will come in for a face to face. The conversation around software is a great start and it saves me a TON of time when screening candidates by phone. Once there here we can talk code samples or details.<p>The second part is that it is inevitable that someone will eventually talk a good talk but be unable to actually walk the walk. That's when it's nice that we're in a right to work state. There's no point keeping someone on if they can't do the job you've hired them to do.<p>Of course, all that being said, this only works <i>because</i> we are a small shop, and the person doing the hiring is the same person who will work with ""the new guy"" from day one.

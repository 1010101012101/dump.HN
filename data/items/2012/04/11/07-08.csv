3826414,comment,3826255,3826255,41,0,philippK,,,"I'm from germany, and have voted for the pirate party in recent local elections.<p>I'd like to add a few things:\n1. The german system of government is very much different from the US. In the US you have by-and-large a ""winner takes it all"" voting system.\nIn germany, by contrast, we have a system of proportional representation. That means, winning 10% of the popular vote nets you 10% of the seats that are on the line in your voting district.\nThat's why we currently have 6 parties in our federal parliament (""Bundestag"") - where you have only 2 parties in congress.<p>2. Although this is ""just"" a poll it isn't meaningless. The pirate party has been steadily building up momentum in the last 2 years. They now are the 5th largest party by member count in germany.\nThey have also scored surprisingly high wins in two recent regional elections, and are set to repeat those gains in the two upcoming elections.<p>3. The pirate party runs on a platform of systemic reform. They want copyright reformed to be more compatible with the 21st century. They want a reformed educational sector with more use of modern technology in the classroom, as well as improved structures (i.e. more freedom to pursue different educational models).\nThey also want to reform the political system at large, by having more citizen participation in political decisions. They want more public votes on specific issues, as well as more transparency (For example: ACTA was negotiated in secret and only announced to the german public once the details were finished. They pirates strongly oppose such intransparency.)<p>This helped them to capture the votes of young, highly educated people. \nMany, but by no means all, from the ""informatics"" sector.\nThey have also mobilized many first time voters, and re-energized many people who had formerly abandoned voting.<p>4. What's currently also helping them is the bad state of our government (the governing coalition is in disarray), their inability to answer to the challenges shaping our future, their corruption (our head of state recently had to resign in shame), their detachedness from concerns of everyday people. This greatly helps them to get the vote of people who are disaffected with the ""established"" parties and who are ready to give those ""political youngsters"" a chance.<p>It's by no means guaranteed, but they seem to be on the way of becoming a serious political force in germany.",1334130096

The article recommends first playing around in the functional subset of the language in the REPL, then learn about theory of monads and finally put it into use with IO.<p>I feel it's better to jump straight in to IO after doing some basics and definitely before trying to learn deeper theory about monads. The second or third exercise you write should have a little I/O in it, do something like a guess the number or hangman game. I've found that it's also useful to first write it normally using ""do"" notation and then manually transform it into concrete syntax using "">>="", either mentally or actually writing it out compiling/running. This is a very simple (1 to 2 hour) exercise but should give a pretty good picture of what it's about.<p>This is a way to avoid the most common pitfall there is in learning Haskell, ""not getting monads"". There are lots of people who learn the basics of functional Haskell, but they are so afraid of the new concept of monads that they cannot get to writing a real application. I've seen people get stuck in this limbo for years.<p>Once you know enough I/O to open a file or run a simple loop, the horizons of your Haskell programming projects are vastly extended. If you can read and write files, you can get your hands on more and more interesting data to use for your apps.<p>Of course, people are different. If you're the kind of person who enjoys reading books about theory (and not the learning-by-doing type), just ignore everything what I just said and go enjoy a book or a wikipedia article about applicative functors, monoids or category theory.<p>(I don't know pretty much any theory about functors or monoids but it doesn't stop me from writing parsers, compilers and 3d graphics tools using Haskell. Just as not knowing theory about attribute grammars or LALR(1) parsers did not stop me from writing stuff in C.)",1334128715

FxCamera is currently used in over 201 countries allowing people across the world to take pictures in a fun and exciting way. FxCamera turns your everyday moments into exciting, vivid snapshots.<p>http://www.thebitcellar.com/press/20120411.html<p>Bitcellar's mission is to become a premier destination for your photos, by offering permanence (reliable storage) and ease of discovery (innovative search features).<p>Japan is in the midst of cherry blossom season.  Cherry blossoms have a special place in Japanese culture for its fleeting beauty.  This year we see even more people photographing cherry blossoms with smartphones than ever before in favor of their digital cameras.  Smartphones are rapidly catching up to high-end digital cameras in both features and quality.  More importantly, we are rarely without our smartphones and can take pictures at any time.  Smartphones also allow us to easily apply a variety of effects for greater artistic expression adding a new element of fun without worrying about film capacity.<p>We want to take this one step further by eliminating the distance between people and their pictures.  We want to create a seamless experience that bridges the gap between taking photos and enjoying our rapidly growing personal collection of photos with storage and search.<p>FxCamera is one of the biggest global successes to come out of the mobile photo space.  Users from Japan only account for roughly 25% of the base while over half of the users are English speakers.  Currently the app boasts over 15 million downloads and counting.  Japanese brands are renown in the traditional camera market and we hope to carry on this tradition in the digital realm by making FxCamera more attractive to users.<p>Through this acquisition, Morifumi Yamashita will be joining the executive team and continue to lead the development of FxCamera.

Ember.js), especially in mobile browsers. A lot of apps <i>are</i> that simple though, so I don't want to knock Meteor (or Ember) here -- that's a useful niche to be in and anything that makes development faster/easier is great!<p>A Blossom app would simply use the server capabilities and data updating stuff in Meteor, but in the context of a normal, high-performance Blossom-based mobile UI with statecharts, hardware-accelerated surfaces and animation, and yes, GPU-accelerated Canvas rendering (although Blossom now supports old-style HTML/CSS views as well).<p>Mobile apps written with Blossom have virtually the same amount of resource control as a native iOS app, and to my knowledge, is the only mobile app framework with 100% JavaScript controls that can say that. (Appcelerator's Titanium is the other way to go  wrap the native controls with a JavaScript API.) Not to mention the ability to run on Android and iOS browsers from the same code base, or deploy via PhoneGap, or target desktop browsers or tablets with effectively native performance.<p>Meteor is really neat, I did something similar to at least the data syncing part two years with a tech I developed called HubSync, which kept a SproutCore datastore in sync across clients. The net effect was the same -- no server code, data stays in sync automatically, and you only ever dealt with the client API. (It could do a few other things, like still function offline, and was also shared nothing on the server side with Cassandra or BigTable -- I've seen serious problems with Mongo scaling in the past (yay, global lock!), and I have no idea what the offline story is for Meteor.)<p>But still, very cool tech overall, and the team looks like they've got some great ideas.

3826338,comment,3825295,3826285,0,0,nirvana,,,"I think it helps in these kinds of situations to imagine that instead of a job we're talking about, there's a girl.  You're really desperate because your mother is hounding you to get a girlfriend and all your friends are teasing you about how maybe you're gay, but you're ugly as sin and no girl wants to go out with you.  You ask a girl to go out with you, but she says she won't consider it unless you shave your head.   Do you have a right to force her to date you without having any requirements?  That's what the State of Maryland is doing here- they're forcing one member of an association to give up the freedom to decide not to associate based on some arbitrary (and we all agree) stupid criteria.<p>However, back to jobs, even if you're poor, you still have the right to refuse.  Just as even if there aren't a lot of girls in your town you may not want to shave your head to date your first choice.  Desperation doesn't remove choice.<p>Further, the way things work out, there are a whole lot fewer Chairman of Goldman Sacks type jobs than there are janitor type jobs.   Thus the fewer skills you have, the more jobs there are to choose from.    This makes sense if you think about it- unskilled means no special training, so there are lots of industries that one might work in.  While being skilled means training which immediately limits the number of industries where that training is relevant.<p>People want to accumulate skills and valuable ones, not because there are more jobs the more skill you have, but because there are <i>fewer</i>, and thus they are higher paying because there are even fewer people who can do them.<p>Further, remember that every employer is competing with each other.  Employers do compete on quality of life for their employees.<p>I've seen others compare someone's assumed need for a job to a form of coercion-- as if because you imagine they might ""really need"" the job, then they're being ""coerced"" into submitting to something that we all disagree with.<p>But this is, strictly speaking, factually incorrect. Coercions is compelling someone to behave in an involuntary way.  Even if-- and I think this is an absurd hypothetical-- there were absolutely no other possible jobs you could do, there's no coercion here if you're asked for your password and refuse and thus don't get the job.<p>Coercion would be the situation if, when you refused, not only did you not get the job, but they broke your kneecaps.  It would have be an act that the employer threatened to do to you if you didn't comply.  Your external situation cannot make it coercive.<p>I think this is the problem that a lot of people have-- they confuse need with right, and thus actually advocate coercion -- the coercion here is the State of Maryland which has threatened prosecution if a company violates this law.<p>A job is an expression of freedom of association, and people have that freedom on both  ends.  That is to say, the employer has the freedom to not hire people for arbitrary reasons (e.g.: programmer knows C++ but not Java, doesn't get the job.)  These reasons might be stupid, but using stupid reasons is competitively disadvantageous.<p>By the same token, employees have the right to refuse to take a job for arbitrary reasons (I won't work anywhere that makes me write windows software, for instance.)  That choice lowered my income for some years (then it had the opposite effect later.)",1334128035

It's not necessarily a smart idea to fire qualified people who smoke pot on their own time just because you don't like the idea of having pot smokers represent your company, but it's not wrong.",1334127780

Basically there's an initial euphoria when it feels like the new language is the best in the world because of the things it can do, that is later followed by boredom and despair when the novelty is gone and the warts are starting to bother you, and when you come out the other end, when you can see the good and the bad of a langauge, then you're a good programmer.<p>It's ok to have a favourite language, it's ok to love your favourite language and sing its praises, but if you can't point out the flaws of it, you're not a good programmer. Your opinion won't be taken seriously. You don't have the experience of working with it long enough to be bitten by the warts, and you don't have the breadth of working with other languages to know what you're missing.",1334127711

I'm willing to accept a looser TOS when my data is silo'd into many different places that aren't necessarily talking to each other. When all my data becomes consolidated into the same place, I want more strict reins over what happens to it. Much in the same way the rules change for businesses that find themselves in monopoly positions.",1334127706

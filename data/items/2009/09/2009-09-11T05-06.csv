That's OK for things like Friendfeed's realtime API where you do long polls that return chunks of data and then process the data online and loop.<p>It's not OK for things like twitter's realtime APIs that provide infinite streams of data.<p>However, even in the case of friendfeed's API, I process the data incrementally.  It's not uncommon for users of my service to receive data via xmpp before the http request has even completed.<p>I also use this technique for twitter's non-realtime APIs -- I use a pull-based SAX parser (that comes with twisted) to incrementally process the stream and collect and pre-sort the interesting parts.  Then one of the callbacks I attach to the completion of the request (note one of: I have several that are reusable components) delivers the pre-sorted, pre-filtered results out via xmpp.  I did this to reduce memory used in my daemon.  It really helped.<p>So while it <i>has</i> one, it doesn't appear to be full-featured enough to work in my applications.  And this is the sort of cause of confusion here.  Twisted has a great network stack and a ton of really awesome protocol implementations sitting on the shelf (my apps mix http client and servers, xmpp, couchdb, dns, finger, etc...).  What it doesn't have is a decent web framework.<p>One of the twisted guys, however, said it should be possible to transplant the web framework part of tornado onto twisted, so that would be great for the rest of us.",1252648774

816928,comment,815681,816612,0,0,agazso,,,"You guessed right. Context switching is expensive, and the default stack size default is in the megabyte range. So if you want to have 10K connections open, it takes about 10GB memory. You can of course shrink the stack size, but you have to measure your programs stack usage before doing that and it is quite cumbersome.<p>With an event driven architecture you only have to hold the session information per connection in memory which can be as low as 4K, therefore you are able to maintain (depending on the complexity of the protocoll) n*100K connections.<p>The only drawback that you have to write and think your whole program event driven; you write callbacks for each io and timer operation and the control flow won't be clear if you read the program.",1252648620

There may be a number of people really gung-ho about the possibility but since it's a possibility that promises to end the human race <i>as we know it</i>, there should be many more people thinking about it. But there aren't. The Singularity may not even be possible but it is past the level of being debunked like a flying saucer - there are very <i>plausible</i> argument for it. Not necessarily unavoidable but plausible. The most important thing to remember is that no every amazing technology has to continue exponential growth for this to happen. The technologies that continue growing can make up for others that don't. Especially if Biology or artificial intelligence as such somehow didn't progress for ten years, nano-technology and information technology will such incredible tools that they would force further biological and AI advances unimaginable today.<p>So, this is important...",1252647995

816914,comment,815531,816814,0,0,amdev,,,"IMO, this breaks down due to the App Store's volatility. To compete, one generally (there are exceptions) has to lower prices to silly levels. That's fine and dandy when you're selling a couple hundred copies a day, but as soon as you fall off the chart in your category, you fall into the pit of selling 0-5 copies a day. At that point, not having a subscription model becomes unsustainable. There are 75k+ (and growing) apps on the store and a very small percentage of them actually get noticed. When they do, they often fall back into obscurity quickly. Very few apps maintain a solid rank for a year. You can't bank on getting sustained sales forever because you take the risk of having to foot the bill for the server yourself when the sales stop, VPS or not. Anyway, the feature is optional and the app works great without it. Apple recently added a listing that shows apps pulling in the most revenue. I think their hope is it will help alleviate this ""race to the bottom"" pricing. Time and market will tell.<p>As for push, there are two bits: client<-->server interaction and opening a socket connection to shoot data to APNS to send the notifications themselves. It was pretty fun to get together and really the hardest parts dealt more with business rules than integrating with Apple's service. I would personally have preferred APIs to hook into the phone's calendar app, but push is useful for IM apps and the like, in lieu of background processes.",1252647643

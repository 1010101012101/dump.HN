The recent ones sometimes come across as articles by people who are short the stock, trying to encourage a sell-off. Most of the time, they come across as people simply justifying to themselves why they will not or do not own shares in the company. And it's perfectly fine to write about why you won't buy facebook stock.<p>It's just interesting the amount of noise that goes along with the public markets. You have to take articles/news with an even bigger grain of salt when a public company is involved in the noise. You just don't know peoples' motives. I'm not saying that I think this guy is short FB, I'm just saying its possible, and that I didn't see as many of these articles one or two years ago, even though millions of SMEs were trying their hand at facebook ads back then.",1337648377

Not that anyone needs to know how PKI works, but they might be better off knowing that `ssh-keygen` generates an ssh key pair, a pretty essential component of the `git` workflow.<p>Maybe that's why SVN is so strong in older development shops.

But maybe that isn't the proof you were thinking of?<p>[edit: also, the clt doesn't apply to sign(sample[n]-x[n]), since that isn't an i.i.d. sequence of random variables (it's not identical).<p>One possible proof I thought of: consider probability vectors of the form p[n] = [P(x[n] = 1), P(x[n] = 2), ...]. You can write the evolution of the probability vectors as matrix problem, p[n+1]=A p[n]. I'll bet you can break A = Projection onto median + remainder and show the remainder has norm less than 1.

I remember while reading Steve Jobs' biography his insistence on keeping B players out... And for good reason I figure.<p>My history is as such: deemed ""smart"" in high school, I decided to do engineering, not really knowing what it was. At least I've come to very much like it over the years. My first year completely took me by surprise, I didn't really try (that oh-so-useless self excuse) and ended up with Bs. Second year came around, and I really did start trying, but still, same result... Third year, same thing. Due to my marks I was never able to get good summer research opportunities (why not choose the A students?) which I feel is really closing doors for grad school for me.<p>But I don't even care so much about that as it really drains on me mentally. I need to drastically reframe this somehow, and come up with a plan of action to get myself going.

4005668,comment,4005224,4005224,30,0,cletus,,,"I've had conversations on similar aspects to this many times. There are many psychological issues involved but the highlights are:<p>1. People eat for many reasons, sustenance being only one. People eat for enjoyment, because they're happy, because they're sad, to deal with stress, as a substitute for something else arguably more destructive and so on. The sooner you can adjust your mental view to treating food as nothing more than fuel, the better off you'll be;<p>2. American cities with their car addictions make it incredibly easy to lead a sedentary existence. Biking is a somewhat hazardous option that's not always realistic. The ideal exercise (in times of reward-for-effort) is probably walking. I live 7 minutes from work and the absolute minimum steps I could take in a day is probably 5000, maybe 6000 (I have a pedometer). 8000 is more common, which is still a bit low (10,000 is recommended). Live 10-15 minutes from work and walk to and from work every day and you <i>massively</i> better off;<p>3. People treat diets and, to a lesser extent, exercise regimes as a transitory effort to get back to some goal weight or fitness level, at which point they seek to return to the previous behaviour. This is a mistake. You're getting older. Your metabolism is, all other things being equal, slowing down (it requires more effort to keep it up at any rate). You should view a dietary change (in particular) as a lifestyle change, not a temporary adjustment;<p>4. Psychological addiction may not be as ""obvious"" as physiological addiction but its effects can be very real.<p>I'm sorry for your loss. It may sound callous but ultimately we are each responsible for our own well-being. If someone chose to die that way, it's sad but there's not much you could do.

What's new is that there are a lot more people connected and willing to use the web now.  And their computing devices have ample power.  And they have an installed version of UNIX.  The network is growing continously.  And we're still not done yet.  It will grow more.<p>The formula for these startups is simple: Take something simple that nerds have long known how to do, using UNIX, e.g., share a photo, and make it so easy that anyone can do it.  This made sense in the past, when few people had running copies of UNIX.<p>What is CGI?  It's letting someone use UNIX utilities, or use a scripting language interpreter running on UNIX, who cannot run those utilities or that interpreter herself.  (Not counting all those Windows servers.)  Today it amounts to telling someone to use the web and CGI to run a script on a server somewhere that she could just as easily run on her own machine.  A lot of the data that is kept on servers somewhere else could be stored on the user's local machine.  Instead users are trying to figure out how to use all this extra space.  So they fill it with music and movies.  Then we tell them they should put that stuff in the cloud.  With storage costs what they are, users can purchase enough external hard drive storage space to store their whole digital life.  But they're being told to give their data to someone else.<p>We could just teach them how to run the UNIX utilities on their own machine.  Or teach them how to use scripting languages to do basic tasks.<p>But we don't.  We think of everything in terms of client and server.  Even when every user is holding the power of a server, powerful enough to serve her needs, in he palm of her hand.<p>At some point, we'll reach the point of ""self-service"".  Because it does not make sense with the computing power we now have to keep letting someone else do everything that could be simply done by users using their own devices.  This not 1980, or 1990, or even 2000.  An enormous number of people are using UNIX (via OSX or Android, for example) and they don't even realize it.<p>There is a place for ""the cloud"" and big jobs, but for most users, like the ones on Facebook, they can accomplish most things without having to use a server in some datacenter somewhere.<p>And this is more cost-effective.  And if more people knew how to use the underlying UNIX system they now have on their laptops, tablets and smartphones, we could see huge advancements in their productivity.<p>Instead we're still trying to keep them hooked on using someone else's servers to do really simple things, so we can manipulate them and try to make money in subtle ways, indirect ways.  We don't just charge fees for use, because we know we'd be undersold.  Everything is ""free"", to the frustration of some would-be enterpisers.  And why is that?  Because the cost to provide these ""services"" is near zero.  Someone else who knows UNIX can do the same thing.  Even more, today the user could do it themselves with just a bit of know-how.<p>Stop trying to manipulate users and let progress proceed.

This is ignoring the racism, social Darwinism and genocide most people associate with eugenics.<p>However, the distributed method, where individuals choose to have children with people whose hereditary lines they believe should continue into the future, has been going on successfully for millions of years.<p>The best I could support would be more information and control. Educate people about genes, inform them which genes they possess, and watch them use that information to their benefit.

I did a bunch of research on the subject, and it is very clear that the benefits of exercise massively outweigh the risks of even a dangerous activity like climbing.<p>It's hard to find statistics for indoor climbing, but for outdoor climbing there is a death for every 320,000 outings.  If you go on two outings a week, your chance of dying is around 0.03% per year [1].<p>Getting the proper amount of exercise (compared to being sedentary), though, can decrease the total risk of year-over-year mortality by a factor of up to 4.5 times [2].  The overall risk of death for e.g. a middle-aged man is something like 0.2% [3], so any significant reduction to this factor compares very favorably with the risk of death from climbing.<p>So, basically, if your options are either a) be sedentary or b) get adequate exercise by rock climbing, it is better for your health to choose b.  This comparison looks even better if you're doing only gym climbing (which is much safer than outdoor climbing).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.allclimbing.com/archive/2009/01/data-on-climbing-accidents-and-fatalities/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.allclimbing.com/archive/2009/01/data-on-climbing-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/107/1/e2.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/107/1/e2.full</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html</a>",1337644947

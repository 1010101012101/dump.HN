Just to maintain that weight loss I have to limit myself to around 2000 calories a day and run 80k a week.  I'm trying to lose another 20 pounds, but that means eating even less and exercising even more.",1327485566

It's left to member countries to make the laws to match the directives, and if the EU thinks the law doesn't match the directive it's a very long legal process to sort it out.<p>The example in the UK I can think about is the detention in prison without trial for terrorism case. When the European court said ""Ah, no."" they scrapped it. And instead brought in house arrest without trial.

That's plenty of time of time to catch up.  So why not just let him study calculus until he gets good enough to move on?

3509064,comment,3500147,3505757,0,0,roel_v,,,"Your claim was that in our current systems 'law' fails to be 'law' because one cannot be sure (with some margin) not to be breaking any law without contacting specialized advise. (the 'without specialized advise is irrelevant btw, because even with such advise one cannot be sure). The only situation that can be under discussion is at the margins. If you meant that <i>nobody</i> can ever be sure, then we're arguing different points - but in that case your argument is so trivial that I don't see why you'd bring it up in the first place.<p>My point is that 'law' is not a set of 100% clear rules that can mechanically be applied to any situation, after which the 'just' result will come out (to frame this within more common academic terms, I oppose Montesquieu's 'bouche de la loi' theory of law finding). There will always be cases where a 'reasonable' interpretation of the word of the law needs to be used. For people at the margins of the known rules (Megaupload), this means they cannot be sure how far they can go before they break the law. Nor, which is related but not the same, how far they can go before being prosecuted. This is not a symptom that law is failing. I'm not sure what your point is with other societies; if you think there are any that have completely closed systems, please name it, otherwise I will assume that we agree that there haven't been any.<p>The ""ignorance of the law"" comment is irrelevant, which is why I ignored it. It's a <i>procedural</i> principle, it has little to do with this discussion. It just means that you can't use ignorance about the law as an excuse to not be convicted. It doesn't mean that everybody needs to know everything about the law.<p>Finally, if you're suggesting that the RFC process is anything similar to law, you're basically making my point of you not understanding the profound nature of law for me. RFC's describe a very narrow, technical, deterministic aspect or format of internet-related concepts and formats. RFC compliance is voluntary and there are little to no consequences when people don't follow them or implement them wrong. The process is opaque, considers only the interests of those motivated and intelligent enough to participate and the results still are full of ambiguities and wrong choices. This is like saying 'oh the infrastructure for Google search can't be that hard, after all I can host a Wordpress blog on the Pentium 3 in my basement'.

Getting on this list usually (from what I understand) requires a whole lot of paperwork and approvals.<p>In terms of being made public or opt-outable, I'm not aware of any carriers that do this. I guess it depends on which 3rd party sites have negotiated agreements and obtained appropriate opt-ins from you and/or the carrier in various Terms of Agreements.

3509057,comment,3508698,3508831,5,0,_delirium,,,"I tend to agree with that solution, though I think there are more and less sustainable vs. conflict-inducing ways of structuring it. The simplest way is just to pay out cash collected from taxes, but that's always subject to conflict around ""my tax money going to support lazy bums"" type stuff, and easy to cut (or fiddle with in various ways to meet other budgetary goals).<p>More sustainable basic incomes tend to be structured as royalties imo, like Alaska's oil fund. One possibility would be to look at what might happen in a future where agriculture is mainly mechanized, so in effect food is being grown by robots. Initially what that'll mean is whoever got in place first will profit from them; whoever had the land and the capital to invest in the robots will then own the results of their production, even in a hypothetical future where they run 100% on autopilot henceforth. So it's a sort of strong-dependence-on-initial-conditions type situation, where who gets the results of the robots' labor depends basically on who was on top in the last pre-robot generation (granted, it may not be a purely black-and-white pre-robot/robot transition). I think in that case we'd have to eventually (somehow) transition towards a bunch of arable land + robots being held in trust for the population as a whole, splitting up the proceeds, or at least a portion of them, like the Alaska oil fund.<p>Lots of details and questions around exactly how the numbers work out, but at a high level I like a solution of not intruding much into the ""normal"" part of the economy, like humans doing things for other humans, but operating some basic minerals/land/agriculture in some sort of trust arrangement, with proceeds distributed to everyone, as their share of the proceeds of the earth+robots (as opposed to the proceeds of other humans' labor).",1327483834

However, even if it could be financed successfully, it would be a very dramatic change for our economy and society, and I don't really see any way to there from here. Our present culture is ultimately rooted on consumerism -- most people earn as much money as they're able to working a job and then spend all of it on things they need. We permit a small elite who can earn enough money to not need to work for a living to do as they see fit, but the vast majority is kept doing what society requires of them by the need to work at a job and earn a wage.<p>In a world where people are free to do what they want, there needs to be something to encourage them to do something which is beneficial to society, to prevent stagnation. The whole system begins to sound a lot like a refinement of what communist countries hoped to achieve in the 20th century, and it feels like we're back to many of the basic arguments for and against socialism.<p>If it isn't already clear from what I wrote, I have no real knowledge of this topic and I'm just rambling.

As another commenter pointed out, this is impossible (if everyone's special, no one is), but it's also good to mention that you get to <i>choose</i> whether or not you want to be average.  Sure, you can rely on being a cog in a machine, but if you do that, you just jumped into a super-competitive market dominated by machines and cheap overseas labor.<p>So, you can either relegate yourself to that fate or choose something different.<p>I believe his point was that there's a shift in the past could escape with being average because it was localized and there was less overall competition for jobs because of geographic limitations.<p>The math is that the market for average has been commoditized over 7 billion people + machines, rather than the 300 million people we used to. That brings the level of average much, much lower for certain types of works. So, the solution isn't to try and raise your qualifications level in a pool of average people, but rather jump in a different pool altogether, where your value as a worker is not so easily commoditized (knowledge workers, developing fields & emerging tech).<p>For anyone familiar with Seth Godin, this talk isn't very new at all - <a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/04/no_to_average.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/04/no_to_averag...</a>",1327483590

And in no way has it always meant ""everybody living on this land"". This populist form of democracy is an invention of 19th century.<p>What I am arguing is that I have noticed in historic annals that democracies that have been virtuous and didn't implode after a generation all had built in safeguards from populism. And that citizenship was never viewed as an universal right, but always as privilege that one has to actively protect and exercise else it will be taken away.<p>Indeed many people do not vote, however when some drastic measures need to be taken, short term sacrifices for long term gain - these people will turn up and block any hope of change.<p>Also I would like to remind you, that popular democracy was viewed as an instrument of change, that mass participation in political process would enable society to evolve faster into better forms. What it has proven is that rule of the mob is the best ""status quo"" preserving device anybody ever imagined.<p>You chose to attack the proposed mechanism, but I merely used it as an example. Should you read this thread, you would notice that I proposed random draw as another alternative.<p>All I am arguing is that some very wise people eons ago noticed, that for prosperity to happen, you need an elite.<p>Thats what kept Roman republic strong for so long - the balance between elite and the mob. Once the mob managed to break all the ""privileges"" of the elite, Rome was effectively doomed.<p>I am not advocating policy here, I am discussing politics and history. No need to call me names and mock me.<p>Thank you.<p>Edit: Soviet Russia (or any communist country) was not a country ruled by an Elite. One does not become Elite by killing previous Elite and proclaiming himself one. Building Elite class takes generations.

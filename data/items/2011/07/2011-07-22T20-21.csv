However, you structure the licensing agreement between Company A and Company B such that:<p>-Company A is indemnified of all of Company B's transgressions<p>-Company A has very little value because most income is paid to Company B as the licensing fee.  You want Company B to essentially be worthless, which means it's not a big target for lawsuits.<p>Company B would probably be a US-based company.  However, Company A could be based in another country, which would further reduce the likelihood of a lawsuit touching the IP.<p>So you get to operate in the US, but still protect your IP from litigation.

For me, I don't feel BMW has the same track record of safety innovation, but even before I grew to value that, what disuaded me most from owning a BMW is the fact that they use runflats only. And even if you've got a salesman willing to swap them out with conventional tires, there is no place in the trunk for a spare without it just sitting in there rolling around, taking up space. But I respect that BMW makes some fine cars and they feel very different on the road than does a Mercedes.<p>The criticisms you have about making drivers ""lazy"" is the same thing some people said about antilock brakes. And in fact, I have an uncle who swears as you do that if he had full control over the brakes, he'd have avoided an accident.<p>For me, knowing that these safety systems -- able to react in fractions of a second -- are there to help save my life and keep safe the woman I love, is invaluable.

Here's my approach and advice...<p>----My Approach----<p>I'm a technical founder with no co-founder.  12 years of back-end development experience.  I think I am pretty good on the sales and marketing side (although it's still unproven).<p>I enrolled in a local business mentorship to keep me sane (and get me out of my home office every once in a while), get feedback from other entrepreneurs and get help with various parts of starting a business.<p>My general life philosophy is to jump in, then figure out how to swim.<p>I'm using a combination of savings and friends & family to fund the project.  I currently have 6 months of runway to get ramen profitable.<p>My product is B2B SaaS.  I need about 20 customers to get ramen profitable.<p>I am outsourcing the design, which is my weakness.  Everything else falls on me.<p>It took 3 months of 8 hours a day, 6 days a week to get the beta version built.  Demos are actually going out tonight and public launch is next week...yikes!!<p>I feel very confident that I can sell 20 subscriptions in a few months, with only half my time dedicated to sales.<p>----My Advice----<p>If you're not building a B2B SaaS product, don't quit the day job.<p>If you are building anything consumer-focused, definitely don't quit your day job.<p>Do you work well under pressure?  I have a wife and a son and a decent monthly nut I have to cover.  I work best under pressure.  But I have never felt this level of sustained pressure before.  It's incredibly difficult to keep pushing hard all night every night (I work at night when the house is quiet).  If you don't thrive under pressure, don't quit your day job.  Be brutally honest about this one because it will crush you if you think you are but aren't.<p>Outsource your weaknesses.  It usually takes a while to find any technical support that's worth a damn.  Be prepared to pay top dollar for it.  Post your needs on all the outsourcing/freelance/crowdsourcing sites.  Post it on craigslist (both locally and elsewhere).  I found that each site has a specific pool of talent that's worth a damn.  This will take longer than you think.  You'll have to cycle through several 'perfect matches' before you find somebody that's the right fit.  This piece really comes down to serendipity and luck and there's not much you can do to hack it (other than being persistent and patient).<p>Estimate how long it will take to build the MVP.  Be conservative.  Then double it.  Seriously, double it.  Then you'll be in the ballpark.<p>Spend half your time on non-coding stuff.  This is the hardest part for a technical person, but vital.  Even if you have a bizdev co-founder, it's your idea, your vision and you're the only person that will ever understand it.<p>Again, assuming B2B, get out a talk with customers ASAP.  Talk with 3 potential customers.  Pitch each one, refine the pitch, go to the next.  This is absolutely paramount.  Everybody says to do this.  DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THIS!!!<p>I was unable to find a co-founder.  I think this is a blessing in disguise.  I tried to recruit one at the start (spent 2 months on it).  We couldn't agree on terms.  That 2 months was not very productive.  We'd spend a lot of time talking, not much time doing.  It's incredibly easy to just spend hours talking, theorizing, hypothesizing, thinking.  None of that really matters.  The only thing that matters is shipping a product.  Even if it's complete garbage, ship the damn product ASAP!  If you engage potential customers (see the previous point), you'll have a significantly better chance of the product gaining some initial traction.<p>Last piece of advice would be: you have to sell this product.  You can't hire anybody else (even if you have a biz dev co-founder who should also be selling) to do this for you.  If you don't have the nerve to get in front of a customer, the skill to communicate with them effectively, the thick skin to hear how much your product sucks and the balls to ask them for money anyway, then don't quit your day job.  If you are the idea person, then you HAVE TO SELL IT!<p>---End Brain Dump---<p>Hopefully there's at least one or two nuggets of truth in there that resonate with you.<p>Keep us posted on your progress.  Everybody on HN is here to help you.  Just ask.",1311365554

They reject modernity, they reject individualism, they reject modern commerce, and industry, and open societies. They want to end the influence of the western, liberal world on the arab/islamic world so that the latter can be returned to or preserved as a bastion of conservative and traditionalist culture and religion. Norwegians are as objectionable to their ideology as Americans, as they represent precisely those forces that they are fighting against (hedonism, personal liberty, etc.)<p>Aside from that, Norwegians have not shown as much respect or deference to Islam as al qaeda imagines they should. Norwegian newspapers reprinted the famously blasphemous ""Mohammad cartoons"", for example. We may not imagine that such a thing is important, we may imagine that free expression including blasphemy is indeed even a right that all people should have, and I think we should. But we shouldn't have any illusions that there are a lot of people who think otherwise. Who believe that blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy should be banned and punished to the most severe extent even up to death.

Back when I first read the book, I was pretty junior and I remember thinking ""oh! I can use this...and this!"".  And built ""wonderfully"" over-architected code.  Now I'll run into situations where after I starting working on some the solution I have resembles a pattern - and it's nice to be able to use common terms that the other developers will understand when you discuss it.<p>They're not 'Do this, and you'll have good code', they're just an observation that good code may often use many of these patterns - not because they're forced in there, but because the solution simply maps well to that kind of model.",1311364952

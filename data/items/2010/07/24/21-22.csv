1544461,comment,1544338,1544446,0,0,rhythmAddict,,,"I'd agree with this general sentiment.  If I need to finish something quickly, provided it's not ridiculous, I will.  Also, keep in mind that when you've been writing code professionally, you have access to either code others have written at your organization, code you've written, or both.  At times, this can help dramatically.  There are countless times when I think ""I know I've done this before"" and I rip out 10-15 lines of something I worked on 5 months ago and go ahead and adapt it.  There really isn't any reason not to do this, IMO...<p>Also, in general, I don't get a requirement/feature/enhancement/etc and start slamming away in my editor.  My personal preference is to think about it, scratch some ideas down on paper/white board and just stare at my monitor while I run everything through my head.  It's always my first reaction to think I need to start typing out some code - and [for me] that's usually not the most efficient approach.  Once I have a concept/logical-flow in my head that I have run through several times, I'll write that in my editor as comments.  After that, it's really just me writing code that adheres to my comments rather than trying to design the program <i>while</i> coding it.<p>I'm not at all saying this is the right approach for all, but that's certainly the case for me.<p>cheers",1280008707

1544453,comment,1544338,1544338,0,0,edw519,,,"Very fast.  Let me explain.<p>I work in 2 modes: (A) At the computer and (B) Away from the computer.<p>When I'm in Mode A at the computer, I'm cranking out lines of code, testing, revising, testing, revising, etc.  This process must be very fast.  Several hundred lines of code (or whatever) in less than an hour.  A complete cycle in less than a couple of hours.  My guideline is that if I'm not working that fast, then I must not be prepared to work that fast, so I don't deserve to be at the computer.  I should be in mode (B).<p>Mode B is generally much slower.  Reviewing code, specs, or notes.  Refactoring code.  Laying things out with pen and paper.  When I have enough work clearly laid out, I know it's time to get back to the computer and return to Mode A.<p>The most important thing for me in Mode A is to see results, any results, quickly and often.  It doesn't matter how correct anything is, just as long as it's progress (or sometimes, reverse progress).  I like to think of programming as making incremental progress in micro jumps, evaluate where I'm at, and go for the next micro jump.<p>Some of the best advice I ever got was from a prolific artist friend of mine who claimed, ""I paint every day.""  So I started coding every day.  But that wasn't enough.  Now I make progress every day.<p>There are many definitions of progress.  Sometimes I copy a few hundred lines of code, make a few changes, spit out a new app, and then start applying micro changes.  Other times I decide that I need to see <x> today and find a way to get there.  Things don't always work out as planned, but that's OK.  As long as tomorrow's starting point is beyond today's, I'm satisfied.<p>That's my definition of fast.  Not sure that was what you were asking, but I hope that paints you an accurate picture.",1280008253

1544435,comment,1544218,1544346,0,0,antirez,,,"If you turn a txt file with a list of ""common surnames -> percentage of population"" into a binary tree it will get more or less an order of magnitude bigger in memory compared to the raw txt file.<p>This is a common pattern: when you add a lot of metadata, for fast access, memory management, ""zero-copy"" transmission of this information, expires, ..., the size is not going to be the one of concatenating all this data like in a unique string.<p>If we want we can save more memory per key, with some tradeoff. Example: instead of having an hash table where every hash slot is a pointer (holding the key) -> pointer (holding the value) map, we can take the hash and use it as a unique string with: <len>key<ptr><len>key<ptr>.... for all the colliding strings. Than tune the hash table in order to have on average 5 or 10 collisions per hash slot.<p>That is: prefixed length as string and pointer (that is of fixed size).<p>Maybe we'll do this in future, and in Redis master we are doing a lot of this in the ""value"" side of the business. So if you store a list of 10 elements it will use an amount of memory very similar to storing the same bytes as a comma separated value.<p>But for now our reasoning is: it's not bad to be able to store 1 million of keys with less than 200 MB of memory (100 MB on 32bit systems) if an entry level box is able to serve this data at the rate of 100k requests/second, including the networking overhead. And with hashes we have a much better memory performance compared to top level keys. So... with a few GB our users can store ten or hundred of millions of stuff in a Redis server.<p>Better to focus on stability and clustering for now... and when we'll have a system that can scale transparently we'll focus on memory overhead to check if it's still important to reduce it, or since we want to be a very high performance DB , if it's just better to accept the tradeoff.",1280007585

Little concern was paid to sound insulation, and often the walls between neighboring apartments are no thicker than the walls between rooms.

Revision control usually has very fine granularity, whereas I like to be able to tell at a glance who was mainly responsible for certain portions of code--- that Bob is the main person who wrote file.c, while Sue is the main person behind code.c, and John recently added major functionality to file.c. In-file comments also persist longer, so are particularly nice for open-source code. I've run across code from the 70s and 80s that's long since been separated from its version-control system as it floats around the internet, but the comments in the code still let me know who wrote what, and even a brief summary of its evolution.<p>And ""just fix it"" for #5 is ideal, sure, but on any significant project there are likely to be ""temporary"" workarounds that persist for a while and should be noted (along with who to ask for details), e.g. because they're workarounds for a third-party bug that you're waiting to be fixed, or new functionality hooks waiting on some module that isn't done yet.",1280005925

Looking back on my own reservations, hang-ups and attempts to teach other non-programmers rails,  I don't think this learning approach will be successful for most non-programmers.<p>The first question I think is: Who wants to master Ruby/Rails and related technologies? Very few who aren't already developers - at least not at first.  We're all cognitive misers.  Most people want to learn the minimum to get the job done.  Also, for a complete newbie, learning is usually optional.  People need to be encouraged to learn a little and then keep building.<p>For example, when I've taught others CSS/HTML, I used to start with big overviews and then moved forward. Now, I found it's much more successful to give people the tiniest bits of information they need to do something and then building from there. People learn better when they are eager to learn.<p>Once they start investing some time learning or trying to build their own application, they'll do what they need to do to keep up.  Figuring out how to deploy to Heroku is a minor step once you're already on the path, but as yet another whole additional thing to learn, it's intimidating to non-programmers. In my case, it wasn't until I was knee deep that I started pushing myself toward any level of mastery. When I got going, I learned Rails as I needed it when I needed it.<p>Ruby/Rails can be learned concurrently. While I knew CSS/HTML and basic  JS, I started with the framework not understanding the difference between ruby and rails. At first, I struggled with some ruby syntax, but after I spent a day focused on Ruby basics, I stopped having that problem. I built my knowledge incrementally. This approach may not be for everyone, but I believe it is more likely to encourage continued learning.<p>It wasn't until after I learned Ruby/Rails, that I needed and started using GIT, picked up JS and over the past three-four years grew to be a decent all around rails developer. My best learning has come from working with other developers on larger projects.  As I've learned these things, it's made picking up related technologies nearly trivial.  Sinatra and mongoDB were a sneeze to pick up.<p>If you really want to encourage total newbies to learn Ruby on Rails or any language, you need to provide them with as many tangible benefits along the way. If they take baby steps and can see their success, they will constantly be motivated to continue and (hopefully) to improve.",1280005894

I'm not saying it's only the idea that is important at all, I'd be the first to argue that ideas are actually worth next to nothing by themselves. What I was trying to say was that their idea and their implementation are solid -- specifically I'm saying the part of the implementation that counts is solid. Server infrastructure problems are a minor detail compared to the app itself IMO.<p>And to the last part about the mashable article... I would absolutely say that article is 'severely dating' itself. Twitter isn't going anywhere (again IMO) and some server problems aren't going to change that. In a year that article will be a slightly less embarrassing ""no one will ever need more than 640k of memory"" piece of writing.",1280005223

Novices who are smart and willing to put in a little time are also fine with it for basic use.<p>So a standard discussion system really only benefits people who aren't smart or who aren't willing to put in a little time. But in making it easier for clueless noobs to express their opinions, will that help Wikipedia? Or will it hurt it by soaking up the time of people who do know what they're doing?<p>As an example, consider Danny Sullivan's experience. If it had been easier for him to kick off a deletion review, he would have done it. But that would have been a waste of time, as he didn't have anything to say that would have changed the outcome. And that's true because he wasn't willing to take any time to understand what was going on.<p>Or as another example, consider YouTube comments. How does it help Wikipedia to make it easier to let those people comment?",1322128681

It is a completely independent layer between the compiler and the assembler. And its performance overhead is indeed surprisingly low.<p>Even then, there are numerous reasons I can think of why it won't immediately be included in a production environment (as won't most cutting edge research).<p>The first reason being, by definition, G-Free is a compiler based solution. You need the source code in order to build gadget free software. This may not be the best fit for an already established production system. However, I can imagine this system being easily adapted into a binary loader, so that it does its trick when loading a binary into the memory.<p>Then, you have the issues of compiler verification. You are right in saying that research quality code does not equal production quality. We do have a prototype implementation that works nicely, as described in the paper. But who am I to say it is perfect? Well, we compiled a full system with it, and have been running it without problems since then. But you never have the assurance unless you do some formal verification. I would not compile a critical piece of software (something running on an aircraft, for example) with just any implementation, without having solid ( = formal) proof that the implementation is perfect.",1322128399

In anatomy they base it on the bones in your forearm, rather than saying 'outwards', because if you rotate your hand its no longer valid.<p>As for the testing: there are so many bones, muscles, nerves and organs in the body that it will take more than 10 weeks to cover them all in detail.

Certainly they can be used pull-based, where others diff code, send the patch, and a committer then integrates and commits. Git, on the other hand does two things differently. 1) it makes it vastly easier to create, submit, and integrate patches (because it was designed for it) and 2) it makes it vastly easier for the people making the patches, who don't have commit privs, to maintain their changes in their own repo, while still syncing with the master.<p>svn does not offer these features, which means that when you dont have commit privs, its a PITA to track and maintain your own version. I'll say that again: it makes it massively frustrating to maintain your own version. The result is that people dont, and the number of potential hackers is vastly reduced.<p>git, like svn, allows a small community, such as ASF, to manage and control a project - addressing legal and operational concerns. committers can push just as easily as with svn. <i>but in addition</i>, each committer can (if they so choose) also maintain relationships with a much greater community, each member of which can hack away on their own with a fully synced, fully versioned repo of their own. hackers get their own repo. committers have a really robust system for integrating patches.<p>If ASF wishes to do no more than have a small number of committers working on a project then indeed, svn suffices. its ""good enough"". the point of mikeal's post is that this is missing out hugely on the vast army of hackers.<p>I said in an earlier post that I had no skin in the game. that's true. now. i used to track tomcat. but it was such a pain in the arse to handle merging my code with the official code that I gave up. it just wasnt worth it. git would have solved every problem I had. perhaps by now I would be a committer on the tomcat project. who knows? svn made that a certain ""no"".<p>an organization like ASF needs a finite number of committers. git allows keeping that group small, yet engaging a much greater community.<p>but as mikeal says, its not about svn vs git. its about the mindset that sees no need for git because it sees no need for more than just committers.",1322126910

987267,comment,986716,987152,0,0,dejb,,,"> because we have been programmed by thousands or millions of years of evolution to need it.<p>Actually I think our early ancestors would have lived with much less privacy than we do today. Many of the concepts of privacy don't even make sense the further back you go.  Living in a tribe, spending nearly all your time outside and visible to other tribe members, with no/limited clothing, sleeping in large groups would offer limited opportunities for privacy.<p>If anything I would think that many of the traits of 'privacy' would have evolved more from the desire of others not to have to experience the 'private' matters of their fellow tribe members (i.e. see them having sex/naked/aroused or be interrupted by their loud conversations).<p>Even now they say that in small towns 'everyone knows everything about everyone else'. Only with the anonymizing effects of very large groups is the modern concept of privacy possible. So to me this all suggests that the 'need for privacy' is not a innate.<p>> But it won't change the fact that we are stuck in a situation where the vast majority of human beings DO need privacy and it is wrong to take it away from them.<p>I would argue that this is true primarily because of people's upbringing - in the same way that it would cause people discomfort to have to adjust to a world where they would routinely be naked in public.",1260417387

I'm very conservative on work machines - they are my livelihood, after all - and they tend to have highly intricate setups which are time-consuming to redo. Thus, SIMBL and anything like it (eg. ""haxies"") are verboten. Finder is basic enough to make it doubly sacrosanct.<p>So the question's sort of moot. If it were a proper Finder replacement I might be interested.

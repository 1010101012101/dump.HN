People cannot really be mature and capable without participating responsibly in the world around them, including being able to make mistakes.  It seems to me like people have to be able to participate in government, or they eventually get degraded into a mad, stupid rabble.  The mad, stupid rabble then topple whatever oligarchical government they have and their country collapses from an inegalitarian oligarchical shithole into an <i>utterly insane and incompetent</i> shithole.<p>Certainly I think that it would be better to have a form of government that can quickly and rationally translate voters&#x27; expressed policy preferences into consequences.  Problem is, existing systems are bad enough at even letting voters express policy preferences, let alone imposing the consequences quickly and thoroughly enough that voters start learning how to vote!<p>And yeah, you could try to separate the &quot;brain&quot; and &quot;heart&quot; functions of voting, by having voters vote on ideological/moral preferences and then letting them be translated into policies by a technocratic government.  That&#x27;s what the traditional notion of a democratic republic (and social democracy, and really much of Western democracy) actually tries to do.  Problem is, that too has demonstrably led to a somewhat-more-benign form of oligarchy when implemented, albeit one in which some of the oligarchs are reasonably benevolent and it ends up being the politically degraded voters who ruin the country by making bad value decisions (like the Tea Party!) for which they are never held responsible.<p>And that doesn&#x27;t even start into the problems of <i>malignant</i> oligarchical elites in our current democratic republics, who have largely decided, &quot;Voters are stupid, so I&#x27;m going to govern on the class interests of myself and my social peers!&quot;",1377904996

The overlap with the 4th would be less about secrecy and more if someone demanded full content from an account, since NSLs are not warrants (legality of procuring &quot;metadata&quot; without a warrant is the much larger issue there, but so far courts have been ok with it).<p>The secrecy part <i>can</i> be a violation of the 6th amendment (right to confront your accuser), but theoretically evidence procured under the NSL will be produced by trial time (except when shown to conflict with national security, which judges can sometimes accept too readily).<p>The real problem with secrecy is the first amendment, since you are forcing people to not divulge that they received an order to hand over information. Typically prior restraint like that is heavily circumscribed to protect an ongoing investigation but no further, which means that <i>indefinite</i> gag orders should have correspondingly extraordinary justification. Considering the hundreds of thousands of NSLs that have been issued, this seems unlikely to be the norm.<p>The first amendment approach has been successfully[1] argued by the EFF at the district court level.

Assume that individual rankings go from -2 to +2.  The CEO gives each VP points according to his whim and/or how well their organization did in the quarterly objectives.  A favored VP may get +20 points.  An underperforming one may get -3. Now he has to assign points to his directors, who get to give points to their managers, who give points to contributors.  Now the sum performance review score at each subtree has to match the allocated points.<p>So you have fixed stacks, but they&#x27;re at least relative to team performance and/or political favor.

Some other commenters mentioned this is off-topic; I think it&#x27;s pertinent to understanding what&#x27;s behind the empirical evidence pg presented.<p>This paragraph in particular:<p><i>It is brutally hard for most people (after the age of puberty, and perhaps especially for males) to learn to attend to sound distinctions that don&#x27;t exist in the learner&#x27;s native language. That is especially hard when the sound distinction signifies a grammatical distinction that also doesn&#x27;t exist in the learner&#x27;s native language. For example, the distinction between &quot;I speak&quot; and &quot;he speaks&quot; in English involves a consonant cluster at the end of a syllable, and no such consonant clusters exist in the Mandarin sound system at all. Worse than that, no such grammatical distinction as &quot;first person singular&quot; and &quot;third person singular&quot; for inflecting verbs exists in Mandarin, so it is remarkably difficult for Mandarin-speaking learners of English to learn to distinguish &quot;speaks&quot; from &quot;speak&quot; and to say &quot;he speaks Chinese&quot; rather than  &quot;he speak Chinese&quot; (not a grammatical phrase in spoken English).</i><p>One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that there seem to be relatively few super-successful Chinese immigrant founders in the USA. Fewer than Indians for example, even though both are large immigrant communities. My wife is Chinese and her theory is that Chinese aren&#x27;t really good at teamwork. I think it has more to do with their difficulties in catching the subtleties of the language as described above.<p>It is not quite a problem of them not communicating their message well, I think.

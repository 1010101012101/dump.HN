Provided the economy grows (and tax receipts grow along with it) the government has an ever-increasing ability to service its debt.<p>Just look at the ratio of tax receipts to interest on the debt. The recent financial crisis has obviously made it dive a bit, but in general it's been quite steady or increasing over the last half century or so. In the corporate world, this figure is known as Times Interest Earned, and is a generally accepted measure of credit quality of a company.<p>Paying back the principal is less of a concern, because when it comes due, there is always a willing buyer of another t-bill to roll it over.<p>With some pretty charts: <a href=""http://www.optimist123.com/optimist/2008/12/the-usas-debt-burden-according-to-the-tit-ratio.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.optimist123.com/optimist/2008/12/the-usas-debt-bu...</a>",1237237000
518778,comment,518281,518504,0,0,neilk,,,"Do you really think it's something about Indians, or just the large numbers of candidates and the selection process?<p>In my experience Indians are a lot more willing to commit to long-term, difficult projects at the urgings of elders. But they share that with other Asian cultures. This also helps explain the spelling bee thing; Indian families are used to the idea of rote education being very important, and even participating in the education of their child that way. Really, almost anybody can get that good at spelling, it's just that more European-American parents would tend to see it as pointless.<p>The one thing I do find interesting is how the gender split works. Asian minorities (in the American sense: China, Japan, SE Asia) seem to have very different expectations of boys versus girls. But modern Indian families, from the castes that are likely to produce US-bound immigrants, seem to encourage their daughters to go for technology jobs. For me at least, almost 100% of the female engineers I've worked with in the Valley were Indian-born.<p>And the other thing I've always found strange: the QA departments of many companies in the Valley are dominated by Indian-born women.",1237236919

There was, of course, a sizable disclaimer about how the italicized parts were not legally binding yadda-yadda.

Though the media tend to confuse these things, they are not the same. At all.<p>The S&P 500 is down nearly 50% since last year. Obviously, this has not produced a 50% drop in the standard of living.<p>Here's a calculation of the historical total-market P/E ratio from 1871 to 2003:<p><a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7B23663E61%2DC865%2D46F2%2DB83E%2D4EEC2DDEC0C0%7D&dist=morenews&param=archive&siteid=mktw&garden=&minisite="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7B236...</a><p>The historical average is 11 to 14, depending on how it is calculated.

Obviously, an average P/E of 11 implies that the market has historically spent quite a bit of time at an even <i>lower</i> P/E.<p>Obviously, this is a facile analysis. The Marketwatch guy himself hedges it quite a bit (e.g. he points out that during a big recession P/E can surge temporarily due to the relative timing of economic events). But it does go to show that, when Rushkoff suggests that the market might drop another 70% or 80%, he's not talking about something unprecedented -- he's merely talking about a market-average P/E of 6. Nor is he suggesting a drop of 80% in a <i>real</i> economic measure, like employment, or GDP.",1237235853

518699,comment,517702,517819,0,0,dirtae,,,"I moved from Pittsburgh, PA to the South Bay last summer. While the cost of living is somewhat higher in the Valley, in my experience it is not as much higher as it is usually made out to be (except for buying a house, as pg mentioned).<p>* Housing: I'm renting a 4 bedroom / 3 bathroom house in a nice area of Sunnyvale with 2 friends. My share of the rent is about the same as the rent I was paying for a large 1 bedroom apartment in Pittsburgh.<p>* Food: Restaurant prices seem to be about the same or a little bit higher. Groceries are definitely more expensive. The first time I went to the grocery store, all of the prices seemed 10-20% too high. However, with some careful shopping, you can stock up when items are on sale and not pay much more than I was paying in Pittsburgh. Buying fruits and veggies at a farmer's market also helps keep the cost down and the nutritional value up.<p>* Car: I drive more often and further now. The Valley is not designed for pedestrians. With the rapid fall of gas prices, this hasn't been a big deal for me, but plan on spending more on gas and maintenance if you don't currently drive much.<p>* Taxes: California's sales tax is very high. It's going up by another 1% on April 1, to 9.25% (or more, depending on where you live). California also has one of the highest personal income taxes in the country. I'm not happy with this state of affairs, but I think it is worth it to be in the Valley. In the long run, this could really hurt California, though.<p>In short, it is more expensive for me to live in the Valley than in Pittsburgh, but it's not as bad as I was led to believe. Perhaps this is because I don't have much interest in buying house at this stage in my life. Most of the people who told me the cost of living was ""insane"" in the Valley were family men who already own a house and were factoring the cost of replacing that house into their calculations. For the rest of us, if you can get by in some other major U.S. city, you can probably get by in the Valley.",1237234109

Those assets that got liquatated will hopefully end up in companies that were sound, financially and bottom line wise. That is the purpose of the bust, to clean out unprofitable activity and correct the misallocation of resource.<p>If you subscribe to the Austrian business cycle theory, than you also realize that these booms and bust are not natural, and are largely due to the nature of the federal reserve. For example, if you lower the interest, you're signalling lot of resources are availiable because of the high saving rate. But since the feds control the banking system, the interest its mandate are unnatural and not based on real market condition. This cause a chain reaction in the market(as people are tricked that there are more resources availiable) in which a number of factors lined up perfectly to cause a spectuative boom and than a market correction, thus creating a large cluster of entrepeneural errors.<p>That is not to say that there won't be a boom and bust. It will probably happen in a true free market as entrepeneurs are fooled, but it will happen less. Entrepneurs will make mistakes, but not in such large clusters to cause such a crazy business cycle, which by the way the federal reserves was supposed to protect us against.<p>For some reason, the federal reserves fails to prevent business cycles from happening.",1237233995

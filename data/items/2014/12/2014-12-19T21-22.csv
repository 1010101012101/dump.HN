8774778,comment,8772422,8774724,0,0,drostie,,,"Right. At least at Cornell (David Muller&#x27;s quantum class) we were basically taught that wave-particle duality was the uncertainty principle from our earliest undergraduate experience.<p>Basically, the very meaning of de Broglie&#x27;s law (a particle with momentum p has a wavelength L = h / p) specifies a &quot;particle wavelength&quot;, but that wavelength can only exist within that particle&#x27;s position-uncertainty. Shrink that uncertainty and you necessarily have a small L to fit within there, which means a very high p, which means that little fluctuations e.g. in the direction of p translate to large uncertainties about p. About a quarter-way into the course it is revealed that de Broglie&#x27;s law essentially identifies p-space with k-space (that is, the Fourier conjugate to x-space), and you then prove that <i>all</i> Fourier conjugate pairs have an uncertainty principle, quite independent of quantum mechanics. So the earliest statement of wave-particle duality already implies the uncertainty principle and this has been known for a long time.",1419026391

Few of us will really deal with massive scaling issues on a day to day basis, nearly any modern language will handle the majority of applications.

The battery swap only makes sense when you are on a road trip longer than the typical range of your battery(hundreds of miles), so it&#x27;s not like Tesla owners are going to be doing a battery swap every week. Most likely, tesla owners will charge at home for over 99% of their trips, and maybe choose to do a battery swap if they are on the road for a long time and don&#x27;t want to wait the 30 minutes for a super charge.",1419025621

8774696,comment,8773481,8773569,0,0,discostrings,,,"The information asymmetry and confusion factor are worst in that all these products have just a few ingredients, in my opinion. While the branded/generic price difference is an important issue, I think a larger one is that the huge volume of products takes attention away from the fact that there are only a few basic components, leading many to buy inappropriate products or products with too many components that can cause side effects that could easily be avoided.<p>People without some prior knowledge of the basic drugs must have a very difficult time walking into a store and choosing the product with the drugs they need without some of the ones they don&#x27;t. I imagine many people are totally overwhelmed by the product selection and they just pick something, which they then turn to each time they&#x27;re feeling sick. It&#x27;s more difficult than normal to perform an assessment of products at the store when you&#x27;re sick, and the store presentation only makes things more difficult. Even knowing something about these products and knowing exactly what I want, I sometimes find it time-consuming to locate the single-ingredient products among all the endless combinations, especially when they&#x27;re out of stock.<p>Things would be so much simpler if stores posted some type of reference. I&#x27;m not an expert in the field, but it&#x27;s such a pet peeve of mine that I&#x27;ve memorized the basics. Here&#x27;s a start:<p><pre><code>  Fever/pain -> Relieve:
  ibuprofin
  acetaminophen [avoid if you have liver problems]
  naproxen
  aspirin

  Nasal congestion -> Reduce:
  pseudoephedrine [quite effective, but the pharmacy must be open; prepare to provide identification, sign, possibly be questioned / receive a dirty look, and have your purchase be entered into a federal database]
  phenelyphrine [of questionable effectiveness]

  Coughs -> Make more productive at clearing congestion:
  guaifenesin

  Coughs -> Suppress:
  dextromethorphan

  Trouble sleeping / allergic sensitivity -> Relieve:
  doxylamine [slightly better for sleeping than allergies]
  diphenhydramine [slightly better for allergies than sleeping]
</code></pre>
The store could have a nice section of the products that contain just one of these drugs, making it easy to mix and match, with reference to the list.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything inherently wrong with the combination products, but it really seems their general effect confuses rather than clarifies, which seems to me to be part of the reason for the design and proliferation.<p>The author of this piece seems to have similar feelings:<p>> ...I can&#x27;t see myself using it, because I usually keep generic single-drug products around. A family, or a sickness-inclined person living alone, could very reasonably keep the five aforementioned individual generic medications in their medicine cabinet and address the symptoms as they arise. I think that&#x27;s easier than messing with combination products, and usually cheaper. Especially if you consider that you&#x27;re not taking medications you don&#x27;t need.<p>> I tried to convince Angelotti that&#x27;s the way to go, but she was adamant that many or even most people really like to take one pill that addresses all of their symptoms. &quot;I don&#x27;t know if people will be likely to have their own inventory of generic over-the-counter medications in their homes,&quot; she said.<p>I think a simple list like this, preferably easily visible in the store, and some better organization in stores would do people a much greater service than the app the article discusses.",1419025345

It&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s an energy <i>transmission</i> medium, not an energy source.<p>For fuel-cell cars to work, you would need to have energy some place that consumes water and splits it into hydrogen and oxygen, releasing the oxygen into the air, and the hydrogen into containers that can then go into some sort of infrastructure such that individual cars can be filled up with it as necessary.<p>And if you think about the amount of gasoline infrastructure that exists, we&#x27;d have to pretty much duplicate that, or convert that, into hydrogen shipping infrastructure, which is a pretty tall order.<p>But for electricity, we already have the infrastructure. If you have a house, you have a place for filling up your electric car, and you have a method for paying for the energy that your car consumes, and there is a way to move the energy from wherever it is produced to your house.<p>So the story for electric car adoption is &quot;You don&#x27;t have to take trips to the gas station anymore!&quot;, but the story for fuel cell car adoption is &quot;You have to take trips to a new type of gas stations that don&#x27;t exist yet!&quot;.

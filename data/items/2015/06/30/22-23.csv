9808939,comment,9807877,9808859,0,0,Swizec,,,"> Plus, no reasonable company is going to pay the 10 expert people the equivalent of the 100 coder monkey duties they are actually performing. That would be what... a salary of $10 million to $20 million per expert employee per year. Yes, you are worth that much, but the market finds true-value untenable. We&#x27;d rather let companies keep hundreds of billions in spare cash than paying it out to employees who are allowing such hoards of wealth to be, well, hoarded.<p>Companies <i>do</i> do that. It&#x27;s called an acquihire. It happens when an expert starts a startup that develops a technology that a bigger company needs. This bigger company then buys said startup for the sole purpose of hiring said expert.<p>They don&#x27;t care about the user base or the interface or the company as a whole. They just want the expert to continue developing the technology they&#x27;re an expert at, but do it for the big company instead of themselves.",1435705112

9808932,comment,9807877,9808293,0,0,lquist,,,"This is what Ben Horowitz has to say about matching competing offers:<p><i>An excellent engineer decides to leave the company because she gets a better offer. For various reasons, you were undercompensating her, but the offer from the other company pays more than any engineer in your company and the engineer in question is not your best engineer. Still, she is working on a critical project and you cannot afford to lose her. So you match the offer. You save the project, but you pile on the debt.<p>Here’s how the payment will come due. You probably think that your counteroffer was confidential because you’d sworn her to secrecy. Let me explain why it was not. She has friends in the company. When she got the offer from the other company, she consulted with her friends. One of her best friends advised her to take the offer. When she decided to stay, she had to explain to him why she disregarded his advice or lose personal credibility. So she told him and swore him to secrecy. He agreed to honor the secret, but was incensed that she had to threaten to quit in order to get a proper raise. Furthermore, he was furious that you overcompensated her. So, he told the story, but kept her name confidential to preserve the secret. And now everyone in engineering knows that the best way to get a raise is to generate an offer from another company then threaten to quit. It’s going to take awhile to pay off that debt.</i><p>For what it&#x27;s worth, most competent managers I know agree with this idea.<p>Edit: I should mention that I am NOT advocating paying people less than market wage, but as managers know, sometimes you end up in this position with some employees for periods of time without meaning to.<p><a href=""http://www.bhorowitz.com/management_debt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bhorowitz.com/management_debt</a>",1435705023

9808897,comment,9805978,9808317,0,0,Someone,,,"It also helps if your syntax supports error recovery. For example, if &#x27;if&#x27; statements end with &#x27;fi&#x27;, &#x27;do&#x27; statements end with &#x27;od&#x27;, and function definitions statements end with &#x27;end&#x27;, and you get &#x27;if ... do ... fi&#x27;, you can report that you are missing a &#x27;od&#x27; in the program, and recover parsing after the &#x27;fi&#x27;.<p>C is horrible in this respect; all nesting looks the same. Because of that it took clang lots of effort to get good error recovery, for example to correctly report a missing semicolon at the end of a header file instead of reporting an error in the file including it (<a href=""http://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/amazing-feats-of-clang-error-recovery.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/amazing-feats-of-clang-error-re...</a> (NB: that page is 5 years old, and does not represent the current state of gcc))<p>gcc makes that job even harder by allowing nested function definitions. That means that accidentally forgetting a single &#x27;}&#x27;, as in<p><pre><code>   void f( int i) {\n     if( i > 2) {\n       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n   }\n   void g() {}\n   [...]\n   void h() {}\n</code></pre>\nwill make the compiler think that g() and h() are nested function definitions. So, the error you get is a “missing closing brace&quot; on the last line of your file. Without nested function support, the error would be reported on the &#x27;void g() {}&#x27; line. Still incorrect, but potentially thousands of lines closer to the source.<p>The Algol compiler (helped by Algol&#x27;s syntax) I used years ago was way better. It frequently gave errors of the form<p><pre><code>  &quot;x undeclared. Assumed real&quot;\n</code></pre>\n(if, say, you call sin(x) without declaring x) or<p><pre><code>  &quot;semicolon missing after &#x27;end&#x27; (inserted)”\n</code></pre>\nCompilation would still fail after such errors, but you often would get meaningful error messages for the entire program.

Dark matter doesn&#x27;t absorb or emit light, so it doesn&#x27;t block our view of some parts of the Milky Way. The stuff that blocks our view <i>is</i> basically &quot;space dust&quot;, and that &quot;space dust&quot; is made of atoms, not dark matter.<p>According to the theories of dark matter, it <i>can</i> affect our view of other places in the universe, but only via &quot;gravitational lensing&quot;. &quot;Gravitational lensing&quot; is where there are enough particles with lots of mass all together (like a galaxy) that they noticeably distort light as it goes by. There is compelling evidence for dark matter from observations of gravitational lensing effects near galaxies that do not have enough mass from their observable stars to account for the degree to which light is distorted as it goes past the galaxy--in other words, to produce that effect, some galaxies must have significant amounts of mass from particles which are not visible.<p>Why couldn&#x27;t that extra mass be from &quot;space dust&quot;? Because there is an enormous amount of mass that we can detect via gravitational lensing, but which is not emitting or absorbing light. &quot;Space dust&quot; does not make up much mass for each galaxy compared to the stars and black holes. It&#x27;s nowhere near the quantity required to produce the observed gravitational lensing effects.<p>Related:\nSpace dust:\n<a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust</a><p>Dark matter & gravitational lensing:\n<a href=""http://m.phys.org/news/2014-07-large-dark-peaks-gravitational-lensing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.phys.org/news/2014-07-large-dark-peaks-gravitationa...</a>\n- This article notes that dark matter is estimated to comprise about 80% of the mass of the universe.

It works for the original Rx protocol and it works for RxJS because RxJS has implemented backpressure with the suspend/resume model (e.g. in the observer you get a handle with which you can suspend or resume the data source), but otherwise the model is pretty much like the original, in that the source calls `onNext(elem)` continuously until it has nothing left, so it is pretty much compatible with transducers. RxJava started as a clone of Rx.NET, but is now migrating to the Reactive Streams protocol, which means that the observer gets a `request(n)` function and a `cancel()`.<p>And this changes everything because `request(n)` and `cancel()` have asynchronous behavior, very much unlike the step function in transducers. And furthermore, implementing operators that are asynchronous in nature requires juggling with `request(n)` and with buffering. For example the classic flatMap (or concatMap as called in Rx) requires to `request(1)`, then subscribe to the resulting stream and only after we&#x27;re done we need to request the next element in the original stream.<p>Then there&#x27;s the issue that the protocol can be dirty for practical reasons. For example `onComplete` can be sent without the observer doing a `request(n)`, so no back-pressure can happen for that final notification and if the logic in the last onNext is happening asynchronously, well this can mean concurrency issues even for simple operators. Although truth be told for such cases there isn&#x27;t much that the transducers stuff can do.<p>I might be wrong, I&#x27;d love to see how people can implement this stuff on top of transducers.",1435701837

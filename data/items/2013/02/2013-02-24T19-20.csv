Nothing that uses a garbage collector ever will.<p>The Go authors are saying that Go is for ""systems programming"". What they apparently mean by that is server side infrastructure stuff, the kind that is now frequently written in Java. Things like Hadoop, Tomcat or even database systems.<p>What they don't mean (I believe) is operating systems, device drivers, embedded systems, real time stuff including many trading and telecoms systems, graphics pipelines, signal processing, libraries that are too complex to rewrite in every language (like browser engines), etc. There's a very long tail of these things and it's growing as we get more intelligent connected devices.<p>Much of that is now written in C++. The question is, will C come back to replace C++? I don't think that's going to happen. I love C. It was my first language and I admire its simplicity. But there is one thing that C++ has over C: RAII. RAII is an ingenious universal resource management tool that gives us 90% of the productivity gains we get from garbage collection without any of the unpredictability, and it helps with resources other than memory as well.<p>Forget templates and all that fancy stuff. C++s raison d'etre is RAII. So, I think, Rust may have a chance to replace C++ (purely from a technological perspective) but Go unfortunately does not.",1361735320

Well, we want to exclude the cases where we get a number less than 1, so we want the volume of the unit cube (n-tuples of numbers from 0 to 1) minus the volume of the region below the standard simplex (standard simplex is stuff that sums to 1, we're excluding stuff that sums to less than 1.)<p>Now the volume of the region below the standard simplex in n dimensions is 1/n!.  (Brief proof, if you're not familiar: True in 1 dimension.  Assume true in n dimensions.  Then for n+1 dimensions, have integral over volume in n dimensions, as ""sum of first n variables"" parameter varies from 0 to 1.  But volume varies as length^n in n dimensions, so this is integral from 0 to 1 of x^n/n!, i.e. 1/(n+1)!.)<p>So after n draws, the probability that we've exceeded 1 is 1-1/n!.  So the probability that it requires <i>exactly</i> n draws is 1/(n-1)! - 1/n! (assuming n>1; for n=0 the probability is 0).<p>So the expected number of draws, then, is the sum over n>=1 of n/(n-1)! - n/n!, but this latter is (assuming n>=2) equal to n/(n-1)! - 1/(n-1)! = (n-1)/(n-1)! = 1/(n-2)!.  (For n=1, we get 0.)<p>I.e. it's the sum over n>=2 of 1/(n-2)!, i.e. the sum over n>=0 of 1/n!, or in other words it's e.",1361735120

5275593,comment,5273023,5273812,2,0,drawkbox,,,"I agree putting out fires are more intense at the office but maybe shouldn't be. But remote and on site office workers can both do the same things in tech to fix those situations except unplugging a machine. Many times the fire to put out is actually on a remote server or only accessible virtually in most cases today with VMs. Unless people pair work all day (doesn't happen) then you still go back to your desks individually and fix it.  Remote controlled desktops and skype are actually better for integrations/pair in some cases when working on the same screen even in the same office. Nothing worse than two heads knocking into each other to see one screen.<p>Your anecdote actually seems to reinforce that for quality of life, remote working can be better.  Same type of emergencies but communication has to happen during them, documentation, teamwork not throwing all out the window to fix a fire every two seconds. Yes they happen and rules can be broken to get sites running but overall places with constant fires need internal people. Places run like that aren't going to be successful anyways so blaming remote workers on that seems unfair.  If the emergency happened after hours is your company setup to handle this remotely or are people driving in an hour to fix issues? (i.e. remote repos, access etc). Workplaces and teamwork are great but can suck in bad situations, at the office even more sometimes such as during emergencies but it has to be done. I like documented discussions and tasks/plans written out rather than just spoken.  These tasks that are just spoken tend to change and are hard to track how long things actually take especially in emergency driven situations.<p>The modern office even with all the near proximity to others, people still IM, email, etc over face to face quite a bit to prevent interrupting flow states and barging in to fix some issue not related to your tasks that are due at the end of the day. And what about the people in the next building, are you walking over there or are you just IMing like you'd do to a remote worker.  Location is almost irrelevant for well run teams.",1361734948

Number one is the avant-garde pitfall, where you have the idea that youre writing for other writers, so you dont worry about making yourself accessible or relevant. You worry about making it structurally and technically cutting edge: involuted in the right ways, making the appropriate intertextual references, making it look smart. Not really caring about whether youre communicating with a reader who cares something about that feeling in the stomach which is why we read. Then, the other end of it is very crass, cynical, commercial pieces of fiction that are done in a formulaic way  essentially television on the page  that manipulate the reader, that set out grotesquely simplified stuff in a childishly riveting way.<p>Whats weird is that I see these two sides fight with each other and really they both come out of the same thing, which is a contempt for the reader, an idea that literatures current marginalization is the readers fault. The project thats worth trying is to do stuff that has some of the richness and challenge and emotional and intellectual difficulty of avant-garde literary stuff, stuff that makes the reader confront things rather than ignore them, but to do that in such a way that its also pleasurable to read.

It was the execution which sucked by trying to account for every situation, adding namespaces, etc. And if you ever worked with language libs designed to interface with SOAP/WSDL, it would make you slap a bunny.<p>With this idea, however, adding an optional JSON-based descriptor language could be helpful. Key would be to keep it simple, allowing the bare mnimum number of data types, with one simple array structure for collections. Allow object definitions with an infinite number of nesting levels, and that would be it. I wouldn't even get into optional vs required stuff, validation, etc. That stuff should stay at the application level. Why stuff it into the interface layer?<p>From there, it would be easy to develop libraries to generate clients in any language for any API just by feeding it the JSON descriptor. Or (as I think the author intended) just use one universal client that any app can use. For languages that aren't strongly typed anyway, the latter would be fine.<p>Someone mentioned that it would require the server side devs to keep the descriptor in sync with the code. No biggie for apps that already offer client libs in different languages and must keep them up to date anyway. Not to mention there should be some doc that needs to be kept in sync (REST is not typically self documenting in reality).<p>In any event it wouldn't be required.

It's just that they are allowed to morph. A good analyzer can track those changes and know when types are equivalent (TypeScript does this).<p>Furthermore, typing is one mechanism to express contracts within your code- such as 'this method takes argument X which is of the form Y and will return something which looks like Z'.<p>More complex analysis requires more and more annotations to specify the contracts of the methods. An example is a C function which takes a char* and an int. You want to annotate that the int indicates the length of the char* buffer, and have a static analyzer enforce that.<p>I am <i>all</i> about code contracts and enforcement of those contracts.

I spent two years at TripAdvisor and now oversee mobile development at a funded startup that actually, unlike certain TechCrunch favorites, has a thing called a ""revenue model"". I have about $3K left on my student loans which I haven't paid back because the interest rates aren't high enough to bug me; I would rather have enough in easily liquified assets to take a year off on a whim.<p>I went into college a ""pretty good"" programmer. I came out a better hacker due to side projects and a better <i>thinker</i> because of the stuff college, both inside of CS and out, threw at me. I recommend it to pretty much everyone going into software development because without it you literally don't know what you're missing. College opens doors. It sounds trite, but it's true: it forces you to broaden your horizons in ways you may not have considered, it encourages you to build social connections among people <i>not like you</i> (which, sure, you might do, but let's be honest, most hackers don't), and, if you go somewhere with a decent CS background, puts a pretty handy layer of formalism on top of what a decent developer knows intuitively. It's the stuff ""outside the lines"" that I feel makes college so valuable.<p>You sound like you're doing well for yourself, and congratulations! That's not an easy road.

If that means that they get ignored, then that is what it will have to be (much the same as most C programs ignore the return call from `printf`).  Also in this case, the RAII wrapper should provide a member function which can execute the underlying close call early and expose the failure, for users who may be interested in guaranteed reliability.<p>In any case, provide RAII _safety_ does not intrinsically reduce reliability.  If your destructor is executing code which _must_ succeed or be handled at a higher level, then a good developer will not put it in the destructor.

5275405,comment,5274705,5274705,1,0,Spykk,,,"I think dynamically typed languages have become so popular because in simple examples they look great to novices. You don't need to know much syntax about defining variable types, you don't have to type as much, you don't have to figure out why adding an integer to the end of your string won't work, etc. Later, when they try to build something large enough to be useful they realize just how much they traded for that little bit of convenience. For example in PHP:<p><pre><code>  $id = 1;

  $dbh = new PDO($connectionString, $user, $password);

  $sql  = ' SELECT column';
  $sql .= ' FROM table';
  $sql .= ' WHERE id = :id';

  $stmt = $dbh->prepare($sql);
  $stmt->bindParam(':id', $id);

  if($stmt->execute()) {
    // Do stuff
  }

  //This echos ID: 1
  echo ""ID: $id"";

  if($id === 1) {
    echo 'This should be true, we set $id = 1 at the top.';
  } else {
    echo 'Instead we get here because PDO casually changed our variable into a string and ""1"" != 1.';
    die('in a fire dynamic typing.');

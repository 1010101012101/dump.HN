All it really does is mention some buzzwords and and note that they're the foundation of the ""pyramid of code quality"". Nothing personal against the author, but it's pretty flat for something that's stayed on the front page through evening. I wonder why it's getting voted up.<p>This article on ssh (<a href=""http://sigusr2.net/2009/May/07/hacker-utility-belt-ssh.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sigusr2.net/2009/May/07/hacker-utility-belt-ssh.html</a>) barely scratches the surface, too. At the very least, I'd mention ssh-agent (a good intro: <a href=""http://mah.everybody.org/docs/ssh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mah.everybody.org/docs/ssh</a>) and visual fingerprints for host keys (<a href=""http://gwolf.org/node/1864"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gwolf.org/node/1864</a>).<p>But, I really should be constructive and write something myself, rather than just griping here. It's much easier to complain about other peoples' writing than to write. One of these days...",1241747957
599028,comment,599002,599002,0,0,mnemonik,,,"Right now I am employed by University Residences at Western Washington University building web apps while I work towards my degree. UR is only one of many departments that has a need for tech staff, I'm sure there are tons more job openings than you realize. I was offered a job at the Financial Aid office after I made a simple scraper that took their student job openings and made a UI with better usability. This is an example of the Do What You Love (and money will follow later) idea that is spread around here so often.<p>My advice is to have fun hacking away at as many little projects as possible. Maybe one will get someone else's attention who is in a position to help you out (like what happened with me, but I already am employed by the university). Or maybe you can figure out how to capitalize on one of your little projects. If all else fails you're always building your resume for when you apply around.",1241747907

599023,comment,598973,598997,0,0,imajes,,,"Yeah. but it's text, so i'm thinking about S3, interesting storage optimizations (alot of it would be tag data, for example,so there are plenty of fkeys).<p>i'd shard it based on some kind of distributed scheme... though not sure what that might look like. Good tips though. :)",1241747719
599022,comment,598973,598988,0,0,smokinn,,,"Tokyo Cabinet (TC) is what I was going to recommend as well. It's crazy fast and quite reliable. It also does zlib compression so your dataset will be smaller than with most other key/value stores. Be careful picking an open source key/value store because a lot of them are kinda half baked right now. (But TC is very solid.)<p>My first attempt would be as suggested above, to use a single instance of TC. If it ever started to get slow or you simply ran out of space you could even put a consistent hash in front of a cluster of machines. Though I wouldn't be surprised if a single machine would be enough for your current needs (20 billion).<p>The hash doesn't have to be very complicated, depending on your key. If your key is just a numeric auto incremented id for example you could implement a ""hash"" with modulo which just maps 0-x billion to machine 1, x-2x billion to machine 2, etc.<p>If you do this though you'll lose the ability to generate keys to search through your data. If you need to generate keys and your data is distributed I highly recommend sphinx search ( <a href=""http://www.sphinxsearch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sphinxsearch.com/</a> ). Technically, it's a full-text search engine but I use it for normal searching. You can build an index distributed across multiple machines and even multiple cores of multiple machines. For example, if you have 2 boxes with 4 cores each, you can split your data into  8 chunks, 4 of the chunks running on one machine, 4 on the other with a single ""distributed index"" that ties them all together. When you do a search on your distributed index for say 100 items sorted by date, 8 threads will search the 8 chunks, return the 100 best results and the distributed index will filter out duplicates and return the 100 best results. And it'll do it incredibly quickly.<p>We're using sphinx with mysql. I'm not sure how you'd get the data from TC to sphinx (there may or may not be adapters for that I'm not sure) but if you have to pick between sphinx and TC you'd have to decide what's most important for you, low storage space with very quick lookup or very low latency search. If you need low latency search I suggest you simply use mysql for storage and index your data with sphinx.",1241747666

Write comments describing the form of all the data structures involved in the problem, and turn those comments into data definitions.<p>3. Then write a comment describing the input and output of a function, write the function header, use the form of the data structures defined above to sketch a function body with comments and a few bits of code; repeat for each operation.<p>4.

I suggest sharding the data across multiple machines because a single SAN doing BDB lookups of a single file of that size is still going to be a tad slow.  Most large databases nowadays are divided by sharding, but since it's key/value data, a BDB is probably one of the top solutions.  If you modify a lot of the same data frequently, memcache can speed things up (also a key/value in-memory solution), but the size of the problem in total bytes may be more of a problem than the actual looking up and indexing of the data.",1241745671

Does anyone actually believe that Apple considers the transaction complete when you walk away with your shiny new Apple device?<p>They want to be your content middleman. They want to force you to shop in their store. They want to push the iAds service. I get emails from Apple pushing books and movies and iPads for universities and so on literally nightly. They have a store full of apps trying to foist smurfberries on the kids of unsuspecting parents naive enough to implement an App Store passwords.<p>I like the general concept -- I was one of the earliest and most fervent proponents of micropayments as opposed to advertising driven sites -- but the dichotomy presented is false. Businesses don't act like that. I pay my cable company for cable and they keep sending me magazine subscriptions. I buy a $40,000 car and they try to foist services (XM Radio, OnStar) on me, and then they try to sell the data about me to interested parties.<p>The world is a very complex place. Twitter and Google wouldn't exist without their users, and anyone who pushes the simplistic ""if you aren't paying you're the product being sold"" line has a position that only has merit if you don't actually think about it for long.<p>Of course Gruber carries weight, which is why I asked about his personal ""investment"" in this -- he seems to essentially be putting his reputation behind something that is almost certain to fail.",1344480807

4359277,comment,4358675,4358675,1,0,brandon272,,,"I would really like for online groceries to work, partly because I despise going to to the grocery store. I'd much rather have someone else find a place to park, locate all of their items, wait in line at checkout and haul the groceries out of the store. I'm even willing to sacrifice things in order for that to happen, like being able to inspect and pick my own meat and produce.<p>The only sticking point for me is price and selection. I want options when choosing products and I want the prices to be comparable to what I see in the store. I don't want prices that are twice as much as in the store PLUS delivery fees.<p>Hopefully Instacart Express tackles that problem. The only concern I had after reading the thread is that it sounds like they have an employee go to an actual grocery store to pick up the order and deliver it. That method of doing things sounds painful once the service really starts to grow, but perhaps they've got an alternative strategy for when that happens.<p>Good luck, Instacart!",1344480400

I think Gruber is a fan of this approach.<p>Apple's brand and future success then depends on you loving the product, which means they spend a lot of the money you've given them on hiring smart and dedicated people to build more loveable products. It's a virtuous cycle.<p>But most web-era companies (like Google and Facebook) have adopted a different business model: 
you get their product for free, with the trade-off being that you have to look at a few ads here and there.<p>The problem with this approach is that they end up hiring more smart and dedicated people to work on advertising techniques, sales, UI, algorithms, &c. than those who actually work on building ever more loveable product. (And they might even IPO at a high valuation, putting even more pressure on the company to deliver advertising revenue growth.)<p>App.net is trying to get back to the virtuous cycle of people paying for nice products  that has been the standard in commerce since the beginning  so that they can concentrate on making a great, benign product as opposed to spending the future fretting about 'monetization' (think about how awkward that word really is!) or advertising.<p>It's a trend I'd love to see more of, and I hope that everybody here gives backing a second thought.<p>EDIT 1: Gruber obviously carries some sway, the total grew by $1850 in the last 10 minutes.<p>EDIT 2: To continue the above, the total grew by $15000 in the last 2 hours.",1344480363

4359204,comment,4358675,4358675,2,0,steve8918,,,"I hate to be overly negative against this startup, but I have a couple of issues with this service, that haven't been addressed since Webvan in 2000:<p>1) The target audience is definitely those people who are too busy to get their own groceries.  If they are too busy to get their own groceries, aren't they too busy to cook a meal?  I would think that take-out or going out to eat would be their #1 competitor in this area.  When both my wife and I were working full-time, at the end of the day we were so exhausted that the last thing we wanted to think about was what we were going to eat, and then actually cooking it.  We ate out probably 5 days out of the week.  Ordering take-out will be quicker, and less of a hassle.<p>2) If the delivery person selects items such as meat, eggs, milk, etc that are expired or very close to expiry, it will likely cause a complete lack of confidence in the service.  It will only take 1 bad experience buying meat, or a couple of busted eggs in a dozen, and they could potentially lose a customer forever.  I'm not sure what their return policy is, but if they have one, it will likely be pretty costly for the company.  There also could be incentive for people to return their close-to-expired food to Instacart, claiming that the delivery person selected it.  It may seem petty, but for example very high chargebacks rates are one of the biggest challenges that Square faces right now.<p>3) Free delivery is interesting, but the 3hr delivery window I think will turn out to be pretty inconvenient for customers.  It means that they need to deliver their goods at home, because who wants to be stuck at work waiting for their groceries to be delivered?  I'm not sure what the delivery times were during their beta testing, that would be interesting to know, but my best un-educated, armchair-analyst guess is that the highest amount of deliveries will be from 7 to 10pm, and on weekends.  If Instacart takes off, it means a disproportionate about of work required between 7pm and 10pm, and a lot less at other times.  This sounds like a lot of people sitting around waiting for deliveries.<p>4) Safeway has their own delivery service as well, with a 1hr time window.  What exactly does this service provide that Safeway can't?  Is it cheaper?  Or just faster?",1344478997

4359154,comment,4357985,4359061,4,0,mturmon,,,"Definitely.<p>A lot of large launches are done by United Launch Alliance (ULA), which is a Boeing/Lockheed-Martin consortium.  (I.e., they provide the rocket and the launch facilities -- for instance, they did all the Shuttle launches, as well as the MSL launch.)  You'd <i>have</i> to involve them at an early stage to get costing worked out.<p>There's a second consortium, also Boeing/Lockheed-Martin, that does <i>manned</i> space operations for Shuttle (formerly) and for Station.  (Operations = flight control from the ground, post-launch.  E.g., rotating the solar panels on Station.)  That one is called United Space Alliance, or USA for short.  Catchy, no? ;-)  AFAIK, USA does not play any role in unmanned operations.<p>As the GP pointed out, there is a lot of money in launches, launch vehicles, and in manned operations, hence the contractor involvement.  As you can guess -- you can't even play Boeing off against Lockheed-Martin because they're in a consortium -- that world is kind of creaky.  SpaceX is disrupting ULA big-time.<p>Lockheed-Martin is also involved in instrument design and other non-launch activities.  Getting an instrument into space is a multifaceted affair.<p>Here's a good example.  Juno, a spacecraft currently on its way to Jupiter:<p><a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/overview/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/overview/index.html</a>

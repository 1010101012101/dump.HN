A directory in a repo may be a subdir of the project or it may be a branch.  This leads to an explosion of edge cases and legal commands that make no logical sense.  As long as everyone follows certain practices (such as not committing changes to two branches at the same time) then a heuristic approach sort of works, but that's hardly the way to design a robust (and ostensibly simple!) system.<p>If you can merge subdirectories in a project, and if you can merge branches which are just an ancestor directory of that, and if a given merge only affects certain subdirectories in a repository, how can anyone expect subversion merge tracking to be viable?  Even if they somehow munge it to work in 99.9% of real world cases, think of the complexity and mental overhead of maintaining this solution compared to what a DVCS with clear-thinking primitives can achieve.

Many other people feel the same, although probably not the majority of people. For me and people like me, data minimization features are welcome.<p>Employers and government are inappropriately nosing into social network data. Insurance companies are denying medical coverage solely on the basis of statements made online, i.e. without benefit of actual medical examination; that's the equivalent of ""I heard ...,"" and it's being used in life/death relevant cases, merely to find a way to deny cost and coverage, <i>regardless</i> of medical issues.<p>My approach to online data is:<p>- Data transferred to anyone, online or off, is potentially misued and should be minimized. If I don't need you to have it, I see no reason to give it to you, and so I'll make it hard for you to get.<p>- Online data is easier to misuse, on purpose or by mistake.<p>- The more of your data that's online, the harder it is to keep track of.<p>- The more of your data that's online, the easier it is to correlate with itself and other data. You're already part of a huge gmail correlation network, even if you don't use gmail. Connecting that to your search makes it much more valuable to google, and unfortunately much more potentially dangerous to you.<p>- Data correlation can create new data which can itself be misused.<p>- The privacy policy of today is null and void once a company is acquired, goes bankrupt or just decides to change the policy. Be sure to watch that privacy policy page! Every day!<p>There are many ways to think about your data online. Some of us are cautious about it.

The reality is that I doubt very much that if you had polled Germans in the 1920's about whether they thought that the atrocities of WW2 could ever happen to them or in their country, they would say the same thing, 'not here' or ""people wouldn't stand for it.""<p>People that predict doom and gloom are often called crazy, but not always because they really are. Most of the time people don't want to think that the worst could happen even when reality paints a different picture. If I had published a paper in 2005 predicting that Wall Street would crumble due to highly-inflated real-estate and that the government would spend $700+ billion propping up banks that were 'too big to fail' I would have been called crazy and people would have ignored me stating that my concerns were 'unfounded.'<p>Please don't use ""people don't care"" as some sort of argument against someone's beliefs. I mean, if his blog post is getting up-voted enough on HN to reach the front page <i>obviously</i> enough people here care about it to discuss it, but for some reason you're trying to tell those people that they really <i>don't</i> share Doctorow's opinion and that they need to wake up to that fact.",1270250872

1237806,comment,1229821,1236827,0,0,GHFigs,,,"<i>Why not have the best of both worlds and open up another market?</i><p>Ask Fingerworks. They could have licensed their technology to other companies if they had wanted to and found other companies willing to agree to their terms. Evidently they found being acquired by Apple to be their best option. And Apple, in possession of the same information, declined to continue participating in that market. I don't see what's wrong with either company acting in its own interests on this. The market was apparently not a viable one, and both parties have profited enormously in spite of not being a part of it.<p><i>There's also an opportunity cost, because smaller companies cannot use this technology and innovate.</i><p>You're talking about opposed concepts here. Using somebody else's technology is not innovating, it's copying. It also has nothing to do with ""smaller companies"": Fingerworks was a very small company and somehow, in spite of your claims, they were able to innovate. And <i>they</i> acquired the original patents. Where we the cries of protectionism hindering innovation then? Why was it ok when <i>they</i> were in the way of others using that technology?<p>As I said before: had Fingerworks not been able to secure a patent on its inventions, Apple (or any other company) could have simply copied their technology instead of acquiring them or licensing it. Competitors would clone and drive prices down, established companies with greater manufacturing, marketing, and distribution capabilities would have crushed them in short order. And Fingerworks wouldn't have had any leverage against them except their potential value as employees. Is this not a worse scenario for small and innovative companies than the one where they have significant bargaining power?<p><i>Oh, but products do differentiate and technology does improve.</i><p>You've ignored the context. You specifically said clones, and I specifically used the word <i>when</i> to indicate that I was talking about some circumstances and not all circumstances. <i>When</i> products do not differentiate (i.e. when they clone each other), innovation stagnates. Why differentiate when you can just do what your competitors do, but cheaper? Why innovate when you can just tack on some blue LEDs and silver trim to differentiate?<p>When products <i>do</i> differentiate, innovation flourishes. (At no point was I saying anything like ""all products do not differentiate"" or ""all products only compete on price"", as these are obviously untrue.)<p>Note that I say nothing about the size of the company (it doesn't matter) or the value of the differentiation (different doesn't mean good).<p><i>software, unencumbered by patents</i><p>There are articles on HN about software patents on a daily basis, and their existence comes up in plenty of stories not directly about them, such as the arguments over HTML5 video codec support, wherein even the ""patent free"" Theora video format was developed originally by a small company (On2) seeking to profit by licensing its patented technology. You can argue that such innovation might have happened without patents, but you can't argue that they <i>did</i>.<p>Software is also covered by copyright, which you seem to have ignored entirely, even though it serves effectively the same function of preventing creations from being ripped off. Again, though: I was not talking about software at all, much less software in general. I was talking about hypothetical iPad clones, just as you were.<p><i>it's innovative because companies have to push the envelope and cannot rest on their laurels</i><p>Why would they if any invention they create is immediately available to their competitors? Doesn't that reward the strategy of simply waiting for others to invent and cloning them? Doesn't that make it harder for small companies to break into old markets new inventions, when the established players can simply rip those ideas off? Doesn't it eliminate one of the main reasons that a big company would ever acquire a smaller company? Doesn't that in turn drastically reduce the value of invention?",1270249817

They all have different DRM schemes and different book-reading interfaces.<p>If I already have several books from Kindle with hilighting, annotations, bookmarks, etc. but I want to use the iBooks interface because of (say) more useful features or to consolidate my library, will I be able to transfer my books over from the Kindle store? What about all my markups from each book? What if some books are only available in one store but not another?<p>How does this make any sense? What if you had to use a different music player for music you purchased from Amazon?<p>Or is Steve Jobs going to wait a few years and then write an open letter shaming the industry into shedding DRM while charging all of us an ""upgrade"" fee for all the books we've already bought to be free from the DRM constraints? And then each bookstore would have to do the same... which seems unlikely. Book DRM is looking even crappier than music/video DRM.<p>I want to love this whole iPad book thing but this situation sucks.",1270249701

Yet it requires a strong self detachment to not get sucked in by the bs banter. I don&#x27;t lose energy when I&#x27;m around people I know well, because I&#x27;m comfortable. When I&#x27;m nervous, and fidgety, in strange places that aren&#x27;t my comfort zone, clearly I&#x27;m going to become fatigued by the extra energy spent on biological systems that deal with anxiety.<p>I have never adapted to strange situations very quickly because I&#x27;m somewhat haphazard to trusting the unknown. It really grates me to hear people accept their lack of social ability as a given, when the fact of the matter is, the more you throw yourself out there, and make strange conversation comfortable, the less energy it will take next time. Same goes with riding a bike, or driving a car. Get used to it, and you won&#x27;t be as drained next time. Everyone starts at a different point due to upbringing and aggregate social experience. Like anything, training helps make it easier next time. This goes for sociality no different than programming.",1385485194

Two when adding files to a shared drive the user that adds the file gets the storage added to their account not the shared folder. Three moving items from shared to my drive sometimes they become unshared and can only be reshared by the account holder and kinda get lost in space.. Four I have a account that has 2TB some times it will say scanning we for weeks at a time. Five when users have the client installed and work on some docs the same time as others it makes a new file and or the user that saves it last gats the changes saved..

The mentality of modesty and collaboration greatly detracts from the sort of dystopian and polarized picture this article paints.&quot;</i><p>&quot;Those around them&quot; = those like themselves, who 99 times out of 100 aren&#x27;t actually from around the Bay Area.<p>Hell, even the businesses supported by the Bay Area elite are not at all similar to those that already existed before. The wealthy exited entrepreneurs aren&#x27;t lending a hand to pull up the taco stand or the nail salon, they are evicting them in favor of businesses they like better.<p>Which may simply be the natural order of things, but it&#x27;s a far cry from this populist &quot;floating all boats&quot; story you&#x27;re weaving.<p>More importantly, wealthy exited entrepreneurs are funding new generations of startups - but that&#x27;s a far, far cry from &quot;pulling up those around them&quot;. One of the things that really, <i>really</i> bothered me when living in the Bay Area was how the tech industry literally does not give one iota of mind to anyone who isn&#x27;t in the tech industry.<p>The tech industry helps itself and lets the world go to shit around them. The tech industry builds gated garages instead of helping solve crime in their neighborhoods. They invest in bigger and fancier buses in which to transport their own kind, instead of helping solve transportation in their cities. Even innovations like Uber are priced in such a way that there may as well be a &quot;techno-elites only, kthx&quot; sign on the door.<p>It&#x27;s only non-dystopian and non-polarized if you already have membership to the ol&#x27; boys club that is Silicon Valley, in which case the entrepreneurial community is indeed supportive and has each others&#x27; backs. If you aren&#x27;t lucky enough to belong to this club though, you&#x27;re shit out of luck, even if you live just down the street.<p>Which, now that I think of it, isn&#x27;t that different from how East Coast Old Money works.

E.g., in 1776, there were no video cameras in public places. But technology doesn&#x27;t change the essential character observing you in a public place versus in a private place.<p>> That notwithstanding, the entire notion of such meta-data is strictly an artifact of technology. There is no analogue in pure verbal speech, in other words.<p>Sure there is! Before mail was scanned for delivery purposes, you could always have called a postal worker to testify about what he read on the outside of the envelope. Before store cameras, you could have always called a store worker to testify about when he saw 001sky enter and leave the store and what he saw 001sky buy. Before automated call tracking, you could always have called a phone operator to testify about when 001sky placed a call.

Only a fraction of the previous work happens server side... You using your users compute power.\n    2. You are transfering less data.\n  Faster to develop/easier to maintain:\n    1. This way you have two differnt apps that happen to talk to eachother. This makes it easy to replace one or the other.\n    2. Responsibilities are clearly defined.

Caching and a server-side framework can make things far faster and easier, depending on what you are doing, and raw speed of rendering is not often an issue nowadays anyway.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the test you pointed to there was showing, because using Go to output json could be done with a framework too by just bypassing the framework, in <i>exactly</i> the same way. It hardly seems a relevant test, and there were other issues in those tests when I looked at them previously - like comparing wildcard routes in one test to hard coded ones in another. Comparing bare JSON production with go to JSON production with webgo (do people use webgo?) is hardly very useful or a fair comparison. It would be trivial to make those equal in speed and I suspect the diff will just be down to different routing and/or template rendering. In addition, I don&#x27;t want clients to see JSON, so the rendering speed of that is pretty irrelevant, what matters to most people is when html finishes rendering.<p>It would be interesting to hear the reasons behind the string of assertions in your penultimate sentence, are you sure all types of app would benefit equally from your approach?

These two attributes are correlated closely enough that research finds results, but there are probably exceptions.<p>Personality researchers will be the first to admit that personality is complex. One of the problems in research is that the more complex your model becomes, the harder it is to test and validate.

Whether you get sued or not depends on how much money you have.<p>As for the legal extortion using lawsuits. That&#x27;s an old game in the US, there are people who make an active living out of suing somebody for something and offering to settle. Get a copyright infringement letter from somebody? I guarantee you that the settlement offer will be much less than defending yourself in court, even if they are mistaken in their accusation. It&#x27;s an industry that people have been abusing for years, if not decades.<p>The courts themselves have to do something to stop this but I see no signs they are interested in reducing the need for more resources to be spent on things the courts need to address these cases.",1385481602

87407,comment,87392,87392,0,0,ingenium,,,"I find that coding while high never produces good code. I've done it before, and while I can sit and code for a long time, I just make too many stupid mistakes. It takes me forever then to go back and figure out what I did wrong while high; I usually have to wait until I'm sober to debug it. However, the actual logic of the code usually makes sense and it works, it's just little things that I forget or simple errors in logic. <p>The other problem is that while I can code more mundane code, anything that actually takes a lot of thought is just impossible. I can't remember all the things I'm trying to do and can't keep everything straight. This is just because weed basically destroys your short term memory. <p>I recognize that weed may give you the motivation to code or give you insight into how to tackle a problem, but just be aware that you'll have to do a lot of debugging of the code after you come down.<p>As rms said, kratom is a different story. I can code for hours on kratom and actually make very few mistakes.",1197181328

87405,comment,87392,87392,0,0,rms,,,"Weed makes me worse at doing anything that takes serious cognitive ability, except thinking of ideas -- but I need to wait until I am sober to actually evaluate the merit of said ideas. As far as coding, I have one friend who says he is great at coding while high and he is a terrible coder all around. I am hesitant to think that anyone is truly better at coding while high, because weed certainly impairs overall cognitive function, especially short term and working memory. However, I have corresponded with someone on this forum who has made something impressive and he says coding high sometimes lets him tackle problems that he has been stuck on for a while. But I really don't think he made most of his site while high.<p>Coding on Kratom, on the other hand...",1197180844

So Apple can put in the license whatver they want?</i><p><i>It really isn't about that. I just don't want to tie myself to proprietary software. And something like apt is fundamentally impossible with proprietary software, unless you go the App store route (let Apple control everything).</i><p>Both of these are issues of trust. I don't think Apple will fuck me over with their iTunes user agreement. I <i>do</i> think the proprietary developers I purchase from won't stop making their stuff better any time soon. So far, I've never once felt that trust broken. I don't think it ever will break, because for Apple or especially a third-party developer to try and fuck its users over would be suicide. A two-man team can't afford to use their applications capriciously if their lifestyle is funded by app development.<p><i>Basically, the second half of your post is just nonsense (""Apple never fucks up etc.""), but as I said, the first part was OK.</i><p>This is an argument that happens here once a week, and not just with my involvement, so I'll give my typical answer: Some people are the type that notices Apple's design expertise, and they're people who don't need explanations; other people don't care enough about design to ever notice, and that's completely fine too. Fact is, I think that my Macbook Pro with OS X is the best thing I've ever used in my life, and I love everything about it ferociously, but the things that make me fall in love likely aren't things that would interest you at all. Similarly, I don't feel your love for free software whatsoever. It's a difference of mindset that's completely cool.",1246805952

Nothing to write home about, but worth the investment for the job interview.<p>But these kids aren't going for job interviews. And they're not talking about run-of-the-mill OTC brain hacking. They're talking about using high-performance brain-targeted stimulants as part of a maximization strategy for some <i>test</i> in school. As if anybody gives a rat's ass about what you made on calculus finals six months from now.<p>Let's see: brain damage versus 10 points less on a test you're never going to talk about (unless you fail). I think this risk analysis is a no-brainer here, to use a pun.<p>I'm concerned that what's really going on is that some people are just wired to go screw around with their bodies using chemicals. This whole take-to-maximize-study rationale is just another in a long line of rationales going back many decades. There was drug use to combat the drudgery of life. Drug use to protest the system. Drug use to find inner peace. Drug use for religious exploration. Drug use for sports enhancement. Drug use to prolong life. Now we have drug use for educational enhancement.<p>I'm not saying this is wrong -- whatever that means. Perhaps there is an evolutionary competitive advantage to hacking your brain with chemicals and, if so, we're seeing a new branch of the human family tree. Or perhaps we're still four hundred years away from true brain hacking and this is just another in a long line of reasons to screw around with reality.<p>Timothy Leary may be dead, but he's far from gone.",1246805070

Some of my ancestors arrived in the United States during the 1600s, and most were living in my current state of residence well before it became a state. But others arrived more recently. Not quite half of my ancestors came from the two European countries that lost the biggest percentages of their populations to emigration--Ireland and Norway--because they were dirt poor. But just more than half my ancestors were fairly well off in Europe, and came to America, in some cases as part of organized groups that formed ""colonies"" here in the 1800s, because they desired more freedom than their home countries provided, even though they were prospering in those home countries.<p>My wife grew up in another country, and one of my children was born there during a subsequent period of residence there (but has only a claim to United States citizenship by facts of birth), so I am familiar with current immigrant communities.

It is a companies right to choose what platform they want to build their infrastructure on, and if you as a potential employee have an issue with that, nobody is forcing you to take the job.<p><i>or because of the nifty group management features of Windows products?</i><p>They are not merely nifty. For any organization of any noticeable size, it is <i>essential</i>. It streamlines IT management to the point that a smaller IT staff can concentrate on improving and expanding the business's infrastructure instead of merely maintaining it.<p>You can not seriously argue that this is merely ""nifty"" and has little real world value?<p><i>Anyway, not sure what your problem is.</i><p>My problem with your comment is that it is simplistic, unreasoned, obviously false and and of no value what so ever.

I'm seriously considering using Chegg next semester, however, for the convenience of not having to check various used book stores for the best prices, and more importantly, of not having to go around re-selling you books at the end of the semester (plus, the guaranteeing of saving that money, where sometimes you can't even resell a book because it won't be in use the next semester at all.  This happened to me when I used a custom ""Penn State"" edition of my Economics book.  Penn State upgraded to the new edition, and no bookstores wanted it because, of course, no other schools used the ""Penn State"" edition.)",1246802500

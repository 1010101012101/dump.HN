2894959,comment,2894056,2894810,2,0,sidman,,,"Oh i totally understand that but i think if you read between the lines this article is more target to an audience like us. ie Hackers, who might hate their job but are still at it, moving pay-check to pay-check not happy with what we are doing with our time, able to do other things but just not stepping out to do it, not for people who have a family, a mortgage and need to put food on the table.<p>Plus its been 2 days because thats when i found this article, if i found it 3-4-5 weeks later then i would have put there 5 weeks since i have been unemployed. Regardless of the time its been since i left work the choice has been made to step away from a stable income job that felt completely draining to being unemployed but enjoying what things i can now do (which is the jist of this article)<p>>Try being unemployed against your own preferences (i.e. after being fired and unable to find new work) for half a year or a year - as in the current climate, long-term unemployment is becoming increasingly a problem - and we can talk again.<p>Wanna know something, i have a friend who i have offered my garage too for a couple of months cause at the moment he is at risk of loosing his house. He is forced to rent it out and cant afford another place to live. He wants to keep the house for his family and doesnt want the bank to take it away and turn all those years of hard work in interest payments to vanish into thin air just cause of a few months of missed payments due to being layed of.<p>Now he works 2 jobs 18 hours a day for 7 days to get what he used to be paid before he lost his job and needs to do that until he can get back on track so that his missed payments for the last few months have been made up. I know full well what unemployment means, not first hand but close enough ..... and its sad<p>HOWEVER ... i dont think this article is directed at people in this situation - hence my caveat :)",1313582249

They're painful and I'm building something to fix that. Another horrible search experience is site-specific search. Try looking for some techcrunch articles about a topic or company. You'll get a ton of results, but filtering them is nearly impossible.<p>I think there's great scope for innovation on the UI, as hipmunk has clearly shown.

You could create a bijection between the set of 2-dimensional real coordinates to the set of 1-dimensional reals by using every even positioned digit to represent the X value and odd positioned digits for the Y.<p>The issue with this is that the intuitive metric you were using in the space breaks down and you need a totally unintuitive one to treat this 1-dimensional version as a metric space.

2894947,comment,2893279,2893394,1,0,jules,,,"> Almost all of their grant money goes to paying the salaries of people in their lab (fixed costs).<p>That highly depends on the field. At my university in the math department, you're completely right. In the physics department however, the costs of the machines and experimental setups dwarf the salaries. Because the demand for things is so low, the cost is ridiculously high. For example suppose there were no plastic coke bottles, but you require one for an experiment. How much do you think it costs to make one coke bottle in a university's workshop, or to order one from a specialized company? The costs can easily go in the thousands of dollars. That's the situation scientists are in for parts used in their setups, and for the machines they use. If you can share machines, that can be a huge cost savings.",1313581854

I am generally in the same boat as you, constantly interrupted by the need for an easy information stimulus. But I have noticed that when I work on something that I truly and deeply love, then the allure of everything else fades and those ""let me just check HN"" thoughts are disspelled because that thing I am working on is so goddamn cool.<p>We all like to hack on stuff, but often our projects are a marriage of convenience between the love of hacking and some project idea that makes business sense. It is in these cases I have found there are often some very tough uphill climbs where the mind constantly tries to escape to more rewarding things. If you are smart and lucky enough to find something that is just so sock-rocking cool that you can't not think about it every waking minute, then I think your complaint would soon be that the only thing you ever want to do is work on your project :)",1313581580

It's only so if you don't make your own fork, which you are free to do. Unlike, for instance, WP7, which only Nokia (soon to be renamed ""Microsoft Mobility"" ;-) ) has gained permission to do - and I doubt they can do more than add a little theme here and some preinstalled app there.

WebSocket protocol is not HTTP/1.1.<p>WebSocket does have HTTP-like handshake as a hack, but it does not give required behavior in spec-compliant HTTP/1.1 clients, e.g. RFC 2616 requires connection to be closed after Upgrade is sent. WebSockets needs it open. HTTP requires proxies seeing Connection:Upgrade to remove the Upgrade header.

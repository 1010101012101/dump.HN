Even lawyers have been taught how to read and critically assess text from young age.<p>I am not sure this is a good argument, to be good at something you always have to do it for a long time.<p>There are things like &quot;how to swap the value in two variables&quot;, that are trivial, but we should &quot;teach&quot; them way earlier, it&#x27;s the way of thinking (and both functional and imperative is needed to absorb). Plus it will have great impact on people not following this career, because they will more often realize that they&#x27;re doing repetitive tasks which could be automated. We would have much more pressure on software companies not to produce shitty software if people were as lazy as us programmers.",1449763181

Seriously.<p>We need a general purpose application that can be used for 80% of all use cases. When you think about it, all apps pretty much re-introduce the exact same features. Preferences, contacts, notifications, authentication, sharing, etc.<p>I want to use the exact same interface and language to order a package from China to my house, or to hail a cab to move me from work to home. I want the estimated ETA and cost prediction to be displayed the same. Tracking a package or the real-time location of a cab should be done through the same interface. I want to be notified the same way, whether it&#x27;s my package or my cab that&#x27;s late and/or has arrived. I want to pay for the package and cab ride the exact same way. Reviewing the received product and reviewing the cab driver, should be identical processes. I think the same should apply to pretty much any interaction, be it to ask my coffee machine to brew a cup, to be notified that my colleague will be late to a meeting, to pay for a meal, to review a movie, to schedule an appointment, to locate a friend.<p>My thesis is that all communication problems (which are what apps solve) are difference instances of the same one.<p>An app is not any tool. It&#x27;s a language. We need to implement a general purpose language, and then all use it to interact with different agents/services.",1449763141

I think you are in the minority.<p>I&#x27;m going off on a tangent here, but even if English is the only language you speak, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily make you fluent at communicating with Americans, because you aren&#x27;t necessarily exposed to the same cultural and linguistic nuances. This can often lead to a lot of miscommunication.<p>I have met many Indians who are fluent in English and it&#x27;s the &quot;only thing&quot; they speak and they wear it as a badge with pride. Ironically, these people are worse than the people who are not as fluent in English because they tend to speak English at extremely high speeds as if they are reciting something, which makes it just as hard to understand.

You&#x27;re claiming that you personally have discovered a major revolution in understanding the nature and impact sexual violence. But the numbers are weird on their own (1-year and lifetime rates are oddly different, apparently no examination of the gender of user of force, no description of what force was used). You claim that the definitions are biased, but you don&#x27;t demonstrate it. You imply that the levels of trauma are equivalent, but I don&#x27;t see a reason to believe that. This doesn&#x27;t seem congruent with other research. And it also doesn&#x27;t match what direct knowledge I have of the topic. I know a number of women who have been raped, and it was a deeply traumatic experience for them. I&#x27;ve never heard of a woman similarly forcing a guy to penetrate with, say, knife in hand. I&#x27;m having trouble even imagining how such a crime would work.<p>The reason we take rape seriously is not one number in one box somewhere in one PDF. It&#x27;s the great array of studies and personal narratives demonstrating the crime and the severity of its impact on people&#x27;s lives. Now it could be that you have uncovered a vast new area of crime that people were somehow unaware of. Or it could be that, as happens all the time in research, a couple of numbers came out odd because they made a mistake, or because subtle implications of study design produced unexpectedly misleading results.<p>If it&#x27;s the former, presumably we&#x27;d see other evidence besides a couple of odd numbers. After all, this report has been out for years and there&#x27;s been plenty of time for followup research. Plenty of time for people to come forward with stories of how this crime ruined their lives. Are we seeing that?<p>If not, then maybe the explanation here is not, &quot;OMG CONSPIRASY AGAINT THE MENZ!&quot; but &quot;anonymous guy on the Internet does not understand a topic as well as a (mixed-gender) array of doctors who have spent years in the field&quot;.",1449760589

A few examples:<p><i>For&quot;: the &quot;Letter to the Hebrews&quot; says something like &quot;Without believing in God it is impossible to please him&quot;.<p></i>Against<i>: one of St Paul&#x27;s letters speculates that pagans&#x27; consciences will &quot;accuse or perhaps excuse&quot; them when they are judged.<p></i>For<i>: There&#x27;s a rather nasty idea embedded in the Christian tradition, that deep down everyone </i>knows* that God is real and is the way Christians say he is, and therefore people who aren&#x27;t Christians are being dishonest with themselves. The main source for this in the Bible is early in the &quot;Letter to the Romans&quot; where St Paul says something along these lines: &quot;God&#x27;s anger is being revealed against people who wickedly suppress the truth. For since the creation of the world God&#x27;s existence and nature have been apparent just from looking at what he made, but some people deny it.&quot; He goes on to link this with gay sex, weirdly enough. Anyway, I think most Christians have the decency not to assume that everyone who doesn&#x27;t share their religion is a liar, and most of the rest have at least enough decency not to say it out loud, but the point is that if you think that everyone <i>really</i> knows that Christianity (or at least something like it) is right then it becomes more reasonable to think that those who reject it are doing so out of wickedness.<p>(But unless my memory is deceiving me, which it might be, the Pauline letter speculating about pagans&#x27; consciences excusing them is in fact the same one as the one that says pagans are suppressing the truth in unrighteousness. Make of that what you will.)<p>Disclaimer 1: I&#x27;m not a Christian, but I&#x27;m pretty familiar with this stuff. Disclaimer 2: Christians do not all agree about any of this, and in particular some will disagree with any given bit of the above. (Probably quite a lot will disagree either with my characterization of the thinking in Romans 1 as a &quot;rather nasty idea&quot; or with the idea that it&#x27;s &quot;embedded in the Christian tradition&quot;.)",1449760277

It is difficult and after a certain time perhaps even inaccurate to measure outcomes, it is really easy to measure college admissions by race and ethnicity.<p>I think for the government the goal is get students from low socio-economic background to college because it shows their policies at lower levels of education are working. You are thinking in the wrong slice of time. You are thinking birth to job, when really the focus for these metrics is on birth to college because for that group of people they will be the first in their family to ever go past high school, some might be the first in their family to even finish high school and as dragonwriter said that metric is a huge indicator of positive future outcomes.<p>You said you aren&#x27;t from the US and I am not sure how familiar you are with our geography or culture but Education in the US is tough, the population is diverse and spread out over a huge area, I mean freaking huge. If you took the population(1) of students in the US K-12th grades it would be the 27th largest country in the world(2), ahead of Canada, Spain, and Switzerland. Think about that for a moment in terms of just the number of human beings being managed on a daily basis the US education system is more complicated than those three countries. This is part of why finding metrics that effectively measure quality is so hard and number and composition of students going to college is an easy one.<p>Another thing to consider which you pointed out in 3 and 4 is degree choice and jobs. First, degree choice, US universities offer degrees that don&#x27;t directly connect to careers, if a student chooses a bad degree their outcome (job prospects, pay, lifetime earnings potential) will stink. So measuring the outcome gets very complicated at that level. Second, post graduate success, how do we measure success? If someone is happy making 25k a year living in a tiny beach community for the rest of their life are they less successful than someone who goes into finance and is making a 7 figure salary before they are 30?<p>In a perfect would everyone would get the best outcome for them, that makes them truly happy and makes their life and the world a better place. Measuring it wouldn&#x27;t even matter because it would be happening for everyone. But, until we make it to a post scarcity society measuring the incremental change in a metric that is a good indicator we are moving in the right direction is the best option.<p>(1)<a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372</a>\n(2)<a href=""http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-...</a>",1449759962

I knew that Shor&#x27;s algorithm means that a QC would be able to decrypt anything that was ever encrypted with RSA. (ECC schemes are likely just as vulnerable, so cryptographers are looking at purely hash-based schemes: <a href=""http://pqcrypto.org/hash.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pqcrypto.org/hash.html</a>)<p>What I learned this morning based on hints in this thread:<p>1) Grover&#x27;s algorithm is a far more modest speedup compared to Shor&#x27;s algorithm<p>2) Shor&#x27;s algorithm only factors integers, but Grover&#x27;s algorithm can more generally invert a function (which still threatens many currently used cryptographic functions)<p>So I&#x27;d guess that Grover&#x27;s algorithm is the sort of thing people are talking about as useful in machine learning. There are probably other QC results that are worth getting excited about for people working with neural networks. The Google/Microsoft workshop this weekend has a number of sessions on quantum annealing, as well.<p>A big reason &quot;unsolvable by classical computers&quot; is such a silly way to phrase things is (paraphrasing Dr. Aaronson here) that simulated annealing techniques on classical computers are already producing such good results without QC. In the previous Shtetl-Optimized post to this one, he posts a Powerpoint deck for a talk he gave at the same conference, and it is quite instructive (but still enough over my head that I&#x27;m sitting on HN asking dumb questions).",1449759857

How do I want to categorize them? How do I want to add an expenditure to a category? What should I call the act of spending something and what should I call the category? How do I want my reports to look like? Do I want reports in the database, or should they be generated dynamically? How should I represent common transactions that I do every day in a way that doesn&#x27;t clutter up the main interface?<p>The whole exercise has left me unenthused about productivity software as a viable product category.

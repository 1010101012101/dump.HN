I suppose the first step is to define what you mean by ""these places"".<p>If you're talking about a war torn country or a country that is ruled under a radical ideological agenda (e.g. Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Iran or North Korea) and/or with high inflation, yes, I'd agree that savings probably aren't really going to be important to them.<p>For the vast majority of developing countries however, most are not starving on a day to day.  However, they may make a lot more money one day but none the next - so it's this variance that creates risk and why financial services of all types (credit and savings) help to smooth out the risk.  To get a sense of the risk, try imagining yourself living in a room without locks in a neighbourhood with a high level of crime - what would you do with any extra cash you had?  Contrary to popular belief, the poor often have an immense capacity to save - in the microcredit I worked at, there were those who joined to borrow small amounts of just so that they could access the network and save.",1253551664

Set realistic goals. Mine is ""500 words per day, no excuses."" It takes 1-2 hrs.<p>2. Start when it's easy. I started my 500 word per day rule over a week-long vacation. This builds the confidence that you can achieve your goal in a reasonable amount of time.<p>3. Have a routine for getting started. I have a special writing playlist and play the same song every time I start writing. Over time your brain forms associations and will automatically go into the right mode.<p>4. If you're having trouble getting started, try imagining how good you will feel once you've hit your daily goal. While you're doing that, count from 10 to 1 as if you're about to launch the space shuttle. Then start.<p>5. Focus on daily progress. Your feedback loop should be ""I won at writing 500 words today,"" not, ""I'm now 10.5% done instead of 10.3% done.""<p>The writing itself is never going to become truly automatic or habitual. What will become a habit is <i>expecting</i> that you'll make progress every day, and <i>knowing</i> that you're capable of succeeding today.",1253550875

56573,story,,,2,1,Tichy,"Access and Excel vs Web 2.0",,"Working as a Java consultant, so far I have never had a contract request for a Web 2.0 application. The bulk of (boring) projects that are being conducted in the industry seems to be transferring old processes based on Access and Excel to Web Applications, so that some company or other can have a distributed workflow.<p>So, inspired by the other post about the impeding crisis of the web, I thought I'd put forward the idea that if the IT industry has been relatively healthy lately, it was not because of a boom of Web 2.0 startups, but rather because of said Access to Web exodus. However, that will only be a finite source of new work, as eventually all Excel sheets will have been migrated (or switched to Google apps). Hopefully by then Web 2.0 will be the job motor...<p>On a related note, is Excel perhaps the most overlooked ""Virtual Machine"" out there? Here is a business idea I just remembered: a platform for sharing special purpose Excel sheets. For example you want to create a business plan, might be nice to have a trusted source for looking for an Excel template (ie social network like, rated by users etc.), rather than having to Google for it and download it from weird sources. No idea how to deal with the danger of viri, though. ",1190159427

I (temporarily) bailed on the startup world for graduate school because most of it was uninteresting, unproductive, cutesy cruft.  It may take some time, but eventually I think others will get bored with the web 2.0 gravy train and get back to real, productive innovation.  Put simply, next time I talk to a VC it won't be any novelty widget or web technology, it will be about something that will make the world a better place.  If meeting that criteria makes it Something 3.0, so be it.",1190156694

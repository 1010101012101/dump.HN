They mention gzip, and yes it's not going to gain you much (and can lose) for small files or particularly gifs (that already use similar compression AFAIR).<p>Optimised compression is re-compression of the images, e.g. applications like pngcrush or optipng take a brute force approach and try several different compressions of PNG (all lossless) and give you the best one. Same approach can be taken for JPEG, see eg smush.it, re-compressions here as I understand it provide the same final image data and so this approach differs (and is complementary) with using a Save-for-Web tool in your graphics program.<p>Best thing IMO is to try something like Google's Pagespeed / Yslow / showslow / webpagespeed / gtmetrix / ... and see if it will give a worthwhile gain on paper - then test with some actual web clients.<p>I'd say mobile-first is going to be more focussed on bytes than those sites targeting primarily desktop users. I've never seen any metrics on rendering speed of different compression regimes though - small files that are doubly compressed seem like they might take longer decompressing than any saving you'd make in downloading.",1358182618

5055368,comment,5053754,5053754,23,0,gyardley,,,"Sure, but the appropriateness or inappropriateness of the particular charges isn't the issue. Anyone who focuses on 'computer crime' or any of Aaron's pet causes is missing the point. The issue is abuse of power, and why the federal government has so much power in the first place.<p>Criminals should be a tiny group of antisocial people who deserve serious consequences for their serious actions, with law enforcement enforcing a limited set of laws (rape, murder, etc.) universally - going after every criminal that comes to their attention. Fair and understandable.<p>Back in reality, most of us have probably innocuously violated some federal law already (Silverstein's Three Felonies a Day has been mentioned a bunch - it's a great book.) Even in cases like Swartz's where his violations were arguably intentional rather than accidental, the penalties are completely disproportionate to the action.<p>In this system, where we're practically all lawbreakers, the government has the discretion to decide exactly whose lives they want to ruin. In the best case they're enforcing the law selectively in line with their best moral judgement - for example, Al Capone. He was generally suspected to be a bad guy, but no one could <i>prove</i> that he committed any sort of real crime - so out of the millions of people that cheat on their taxes every year, the government singled him out to prosecute for tax evasion, and then threw the book at him. Maybe jailing him was a good result, but by selecting one man out of a pool of millions of lawbreakers to go after, the government crossed the line from the rule of law to the rule of man. And think of the result when the government's initial instinct about a person's ""good guy"" vs. ""bad guy"" status is wrong!<p>In this system, the nightmare is the malicious prosecutor, one that's not even attempting to ""do what's right"" but instead is selecting cases to prosecute for personal motivations - political advancement, personal causes, etc. People who are initially targeted for federal prosecution but somehow 'escape' are frequently recharged for something else - for example, the hapless fuel-cell entrepreneur Krister Evertson. That's what it sounds like happened to Aaron Swartz - thanks to the previous federal investigation into PACER, when he popped up again the federal government was delighted to go after him with both barrels, for reasons having nothing to do with MIT or JSTOR. Even if PACER wasn't an influence, going after Swartz instead of modern Al Capones shows that the arbitrary rule of man we've got in place of a real legal system is working pretty damn poorly.<p>The way to solve this problem, ultimately, would be to dramatically shrink the size of criminal federal law - ideally by limiting what can be declared criminal in the constitution, since we certainly can't rely on the legislative branch's sense of justice. This will never happen, at least not until this system is torn down and another is constructed (yeah, you scoff, but historically this does happen from time to time). In the meantime, we might as well find legal ways to make being a prosecutor politically unrewarding, and look for incremental reform where we can find it.",1358182380

5055202,comment,5054689,5054871,57,0,ballooney,,,"It's not really mentioned in the article but as a starting point they received all the work done for Fastrac [1], a NASA program to build small, cheap, expendable rockets - something like the Falcon 1. That got cancelled as NASA projects are wont to do but it made sense to use that design as a baseline. A clean sheet engine design is very complicated indeed - it's a very high dimensional, highly coupled optimisation problem, so a known good starting point is a very valuable thing to have.<p>Indeed the turbopump, which is one of the hardest bits of a rocket engine, is made by Barber Nichols, who made the turbopump for Fastrac and who make the turbopumps for the Merlin engines [2]. I've heard rocket engineers describe rocket engines as turbopumps with some extra plumbing. Perhaps a slight exaggeration but not far off, especially since their design is so tightly coupled and dependent upon overall engine parameters. The degree of coupling depends on the topology of the plumbing, or the 'cycle' of the engine, which I'll try and explain:<p>There are three kinds of rocket engine cycle (well, there are maybe more but these are the three that have been flown historically). The Expander Cycle, the Staged Combustion Cycle, and the Gas Generator cycle. I'll mention the last two.<p>Merlin, as the article mentions, is an example of a Gas Generator cycle [3]. In this cycle, you take off a little bit of fuel and oxidiser to burn outside the main combustion chamber, to generate some hot energetic gases that you can exhaust over a turbine. This spins the turbine up, which is connected to a shaft with a compressor on the other end. The compressor increases the pressure of the propellents so that they can be injected into the main combustion chamber. This assembly (turbine, shaft, compressor) is called the turbopump. It's necessary because the engines require very high flow rates to get the thrust they need, and that has to be at a high pressure - higher than the pressure of the combusting gases inside the combustion chamber, else you wouldn't be able to inject it!<p>Back to the bleed-off to drive the turbine. You usually don't want a perfect stoichiometric mix of fuel and oxidiser for this, or even close, because it generates extraordinary hot gases that no turbine would last long in (The turbines are spinning at many tens of thousands of RPM usually so would be subject to much higher forces than the actively cooled walls of the main combustion chamber). For this reason you usually have a large imbalance of one propellent to the other to keep the temperature down. Usually you run with excess fuel, or 'fuel-rich', as the opposite - oxidiser rich - means you have hot oxidising gases which are harder on the metallurgy. I do know of some russian exceptions to this, though, where fuel rich would have left sooty deposits in the plumbing (The materials science employed in the turbines was apparently so witchcraft that when the US got intelligence of oxidiser-rich turbine precombustors, they thought is was deliberate counterintelligence from the russians to get them to waste billions researching the impossible). The gas generator cycle, as the article mentions, dumps this turbine exhaust overboard separately. The problem with this is that there's a load of uncombusted fuel in this exhaust, which you're just wasting, and this hits your rocket performance - the Specific Impulse ( I_{sp} ), as you're not getting as much bang out of a given mass of fuel as you could.<p>The answer to this is the Staged Combustion Cycle [4], where you also inject the exhaust of the turbine into the combustion chamber to finish off combustion. The performance of these engines is higher but the thermodynamic balance to design a working system is a greater challenge, and some of the engineering is a bit harder too. Staged Combustion engines are mostly russian, although the Space Shuttle Main Engines are a US-design example of Staged combustion.<p>SpaceX have been gradually and incrementally improving the Merlin's away from their simpler beginnings, and it's been pleasing to watch as an interested outsider. To bring it back to the OP question, ""are all engines of that caliber that size or is this one special?"", Merlin didn't particularly stand out in terms of power density in the early days, although it's been improving and improving. Now there is the Merlin 1D [5], which claims to have the highest thrust to weight of any rocket engine every made. One should take these claims with a pinch of salt as what counts as 'engine' and what counts as 'plumbing' and what counts as fuel tank is sort of open to debate and you can do some creative accounting to make your numbers look better. However, it's an impressive achievement regardless.<p>The metric that doesn't lie, from a performance point of view, is the mass fraction of the rocket - that is the fraction of the all-up, fuelled-up mass of the rocket on the pad that makes it into orbit. The higher the better - i.e. you can take bigger payloads for a given size rocket. Note this is just from a performance point of view, not an economics point of view.<p>However, increasing mass fraction will be important to SpaceXs staged aim of re-usable rockets. That's because as well as the payload, each rocket stage as to also carry the fuel it needs to land. I believe Falcon 9 can launch about 2% of its pad mass into orbit (i.e. the payload can be 2% of the total mass), and Musk reckons if that could be increased to about 4 or 5%, there's be enough margin to carry enough landing fuel and extra landing hardware like legs.<p>So my bet, just for fun (I'm not connected with SpaceX, this is just sideline speculation for the sake of interest) is that you might start to see development of a Staged combustion engine instead of gas generator, and a switch to methane fuel which, with LOX, has a slightly higher specific impulse than Lox/Kerosene which they currently use. Maybe 20 seconds extra (seconds being the unit of specific impulse), which is maybe 5-7% more than they might be seeing now, which is worth having. Methane is nice because it has a similar density to kerosene. Lox/LH2 has almost 50% better performance than LOX/Kerosene in theory but LH2 is of a very much lower density, so the tanks must be much bigger (the illustrates my earlier point about the slipperyness of engine-only thrust to weight as a metric - how much bigger and heavier are the tanks?).<p>[Edit: of course instead of building a higher performance engine you could just built a much bigger rocket with the same mass fraction and have the cargo be a smaller percentage of launch mass. probably cheaper than developing a staged combustion engine. I suspect the rocket science equivalent of more servers vs a rewrite in C]<p>This post has ended up being a bit longer than I thought it would.

For example, there may be a Facebook group for a niche that is far more active than a dedicated forum site. There may be some good niche sites that are not ranked high enough. The idea is to let people submit good sites they know about.<p>- to make all such sites available at one place for quick access, not only for me but anyone else who is interested.<p><i>people have to remember that this list exists when they are thinking of ideas</i><p>- It is not just about discovering startup ideas. It is about interacting with people outside hacker community through these sites. You may know about problems they face and it can result in some good ideas but it will also be helpful in marketing some existing products for that niche.<p>- One thing I would like to make clear is that if enough links are provided I will make a website/google doc for this where anyone can submit new websites. May be I will do it anyway but there is no harm in asking for more such sites from community.<p><i>Who will take it upon themselves to categorize these and present them in a helpful way? Who will curate this list to ensure that only the ""right"" sites are added? </i><p>I will do that on a dedicated site/google doc.  I don't think it is a very time intensive task. HackerNews isn't a good place to keep and maintain such information but people here can definitely help by submitting the sites they know about.<p><i>who will curate this list over time by adding, removing, and editing it?</i><p>If I make a small web app for this(it will take just few hours) anyone can submit sites and people who are interested in maintaining it can be made moderator. In any case some effort is definitely required and if people find it valuable it is worth the effort.<p>I guess you raised all these questions because you thought I am proposing that this list should be created and maintained on HN itself. That is simply not most effective way to do that. May be I didn't made it clear but the objective of this post was to just collect such links not make a wiki on HN.",1358180073

5055171,comment,5048132,5050132,1,0,zoba,,,"I think this is a good question.  My first conclusion I drew as an undergrad was that since I cannot currently grasp the purpose, I need to put myself in a position where that would be more likely.  My grades went from just barely passing to near 4.0.  I knew I needed to do well in school so that I could learn more, so that I can be more valuable to others, so that I may obtain more wealth and influence, so that I can have the ability to do more things...and perhaps one of those things would be discovering the purpose.<p>Since no one before has ever extracted the purpose from the fabric of the universe, I knew I needed to be able to do things that none, or very few, have been able to do.  I decided I cannot lead an average life.  Even if the average life of an American in the 2000s offers much more than an average life even 100 years ago, my rough estimations suggest that this still isn't enough to find the purpose.<p>I also went about abolishing my depression.  Depression served no purpose other than to limit me by sapping energy, making me disinterested in things, and disinterested in people.  I forced myself to find meaning in things based on what they meant to my new ultimate goal, that is, discovering the ultimate goal.  With a goal in mind that I actually believed in, I could feel happiness and accomplishment every time I took a step towards it.  The depression ended.<p>I studied what it is that makes people successful.  It appears to me that being valuable to other people is central.  Luckily I'm already fairly smart, because large scale success (as opposed to just being successful in your social group) implies a higher bar of ability since your social group is now ""the world"".  Being smart is good, but isn't quite valuable  to other people in a large way.  So, I'm developing tools to help people improve their lives and simultaneously aim to elevate myself by elevating other people.<p>The final piece I feel I should share is that eventually, my ability to search for the purpose will run out.  Specifically, I mean death.  However, unlike previous generations, my generation has the luxury of believing (through medicine and technology) that there is a small probability that we can escape death far longer than those who've lived before us.  I am torn about how to approach this.  Should I drop everything and go study medicine and be a direct contributing factor to possibly escaping death, or should I gain wealth and influence and promote research through those means?  I have decided on the latter for now.  It is a bet, and its one I'm unsure of.  In the end, though, if it becomes clear I'm on the verge of death... I can at least have piece of mind that I did as best I could and have no regrets for the way I spent my life.<p>Either there is a purpose or there isn't, and I will find it or I won't.  If there is a purpose and I find it, win.  If there isn't a purpose and I don't find it, then things like 'win' and 'lose' don't make sense because there is no way to be doing the right or wrong thing without some purpose to judge it against.  If there isn't a purpose and I do find it -- thats not possible.  If there is a purpose and I don't find it then, while perhaps its sad that I missed out on discovering it, I can rest assured that I've done everything in my ability to discover it, and hold no blame on myself for not living more optimally / doing the right thing.",1358179691

For example, Python does not even try to provide a safe sandbox for web applets while Java does, so the current problem does not even have a meaningful equivalent in the Python world.<p>My armchair guess is that neither of the two will have a completely terrible track record compared to the other one, and so picking either one should be fine from the point of view of security. In any case you'll have to respond to eventual problems in a timely manner.",1358179608

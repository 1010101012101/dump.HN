134858,comment,134703,134838,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I congratulate you for finding a non-web designer who was able to get the job done well for you.<p>In my experience traditional print designers generally do not do a good job of creating a website design. They don't understand the deal with background images or what is and isn't possible, they prefer to use nonstandard fonts (easily fixed) and they typically don't understand what is and isn't possible with the technology being used.<p>Here's an example of what a print designer came up with for a website for a client of mine: <a href=""http://cocunderground.com/fpt.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cocunderground.com/fpt.jpg</a><p>The original designs looked best in my opinion, but the final (read, compromised) version can be seen at <a href=""http://freepromotips.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freepromotips.com</a>",1205290676

134847,comment,134611,134611,0,0,bkrausz,,,"Terrible business...1&1 and similar hosts killed all of the margins.<p>I was basically given a hosting business with 50 clients when the owner didn't want to maintain it anymore.  Even paying another company to do support, we had so many issues: credit card chargebacks, customers complaining about things that aren't our problem, server issues.  I think at one point I figured I would be making less than minimum wage with the time I put into it (with no hope of growing out of that).  We eventually sold for a paltry amount just to wipe our hands clean of it.<p>The only time it is worth it to do hosting is when it's in conjunction with another service...for example web designers often do hosting because a) they work it into part of their contract with a decent rate, instead of the insanely low-margin rates online now and b) since they made the website, if there's a problem they have fewer people to deal with (i.e. vertical integration).",1205289766

134840,comment,134388,134388,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Quite right.<p>A client (back when I was a teenage ""computer hacker"", fixing people's computers for pizza money) had the problem that her computer was unstable. It would shut down at random times. Printing stuff <i>at night only</i> would do it; shortly after printing, the computer would shut down. Also, it would shut down when it was cold, and only restart when the house was warm. And while things would be fine if she was using it, it would turn off if she went off to do other things (e.g. iron her clothes).<p>Hard to diagnose, but a wild guess: power issue. Lets try swapping out the power supply.<p>The <i></i>real<i></i> first problem: unplugging it. There was a single outlet, with a red/black tree of power strips/extension cords plugged into it. Not just computer equipment, it was also plugged into a space heater, air conditioner, alarm clock, coffee maker, etc.<p>After plugging all the crap into a different outlet, I unplugged the computer and opened it up. Didn't have a power supply with enough watts. Promised to get back to her in a day or two.<p>When I called her back, everything was fine. The ""teenage hacker"" solved her computer problem, stopped her lights from flickering, and made her alarm clock stop turning off whenever she vacuumed.<p>The problem: 1 socket, about 3000 watts. When it got cold, she turned the space heater on. Computer drained of power, switches off. Print something at night, switch on a 500 watt halogen lamp, computer shuts off.",1205288587

In other words, someone who didn't have any predefined notion of what to do on the web, someone whose core skill is to get a message across in milliseconds and to draw people in.<p>It worked out really, really well for us; it may be worth your while to look outside typical web designers.  That said, we already knew what the application flow would be like, so it was a matter of 'skinning' for us -- color scheme, iconography, etc.",1205288543

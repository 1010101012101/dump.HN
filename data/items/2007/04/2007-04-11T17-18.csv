11973,comment,11285,11518,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I actually kinda like the concept.  Some feedback:<p>1.) Every alpha test should have an easily acceptable ""Feedback"" link <i>in the layout</i>.  I know you've got ""Contact Us"" on the about page, but most people won't look that far (I wouldn't have had someone not commented about ads on the About page).  Feedback is for your benefit, not really your users, so users will not jump through hoops to give it to you.<p>2.) The front page is too cluttered.  A lot of sites try to give a taste of every bit of functionality on the front page, but it doesn't work well.  Which do you go to: Google or Yahoo?  Why did AltaVista die (hint: it had something to do with ""portal"")?  I'd take the Most Active and Last Registered users off the front page and onto a separate ""Stats"" page.<p>3.) You need to display more than a couple sentences of each story in the summary.  Typically, readers decide whether they'll read a book after the first 2 paragraphs or so (that's an oft-quoted statistic from the dead-tree publishing world).  I'd display about that much, and avoid cutting stories off in mid-sentence.<p>4.) The language links should also filter the stories visible to a casual browser.  I can't read Italian, and so have no interest in Italian stories.  Also, duplicate the language links on the story box itself.  I was looking for some way to filter the languages and didn't see any until my eyes moved up to the top left corner.",1176314377

11967,comment,11924,11961,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"I know Arc is way better than PHP and was even before it existed (IMO a language that doesn't exist is better than PHP). My point in the first sentence was that all we can <i>see</i> of Arc is this web page, a replica of which could be created in PHP with little or no change in the user experience. <p>Anyway, the bashing part would presumably be because some of it isn't finished, or because people don't understand some of his decisions that he didn't explain, not because the language is bad. I theorize based on what's been written about it that Arc is a quite nice language to use, particularly for Lispers. ",1176313726
11966,comment,11924,11953,0,0,zach,,,"Well, the YC funding process has just moved from application to interview stage, so they have a little while to go there.<p>You're right about the expectations, though.  I mischievously wonder if it should be initially released in a source form that requires a lot of work to get it running.  That way you skew things away from casual users who aren't going to get much out of it, and towards enthusiasts who will be congratulating themselves for building it or finding some weird RPM of it on BitTorrent.",1176313583

11962,comment,11949,11949,0,0,danielha,,,"<i>This has led to a technical ""cat and mouse"" game, with Rogers now one of the only ISPs in the world to simply degrade encrypted traffic. </i><p>Wow; that is so stupid. <p>Reading something like this always sparks some net neutrality support inside of me, but otherwise I'm still on the fence (leaning either way depending on the time of day). The principles of net neutrality are sound, but increased regulation always makes me wary. There may be high costs associated with ""a packet is a packet"" philosophy; for example, preserving the current nature of the Internet with legislation could stifle major overhauls to its core. And it just seems that some packet bias is necessary to ensure quality services for specific protocols.<p>I'd be less hesitant about neutrality if the proposed legislations was truly fine tuned to just prevent the ISPs from screwing the customers.",1176313365

""When I said that Microsoft was dead, I meant they had, like IBM before them, passed across into this underworld.""<p>so you are basically saying now that ibm is dead... in which you define it as ""people at the leading edge of the software business no longer have to think about them.""<p>i guess many would disagree with you on what ""leading edge"" or relevance in software is about.  if you think these web2.0 companies, then perhaps, then many will disagree with you whether there's much new tech coming out of these web 2.0 companies.

Whats up with that?  Just meet somewhere and have some sushi or drinks or something.<p>I have a friend who is originally from brazil who has a lot of VC contacts down there, and according to him they are all itching to get their claws into some american startups, because there's simply not much entrepreneuriship going on in brazil outside of banana stands.  He lives in tennessee though, but he said he is very very interested in coming down for some of these meet n greets with atlanta area startups.

It seems to me that if you're at the point where you're rewriting internals for speed, you're at the point where it works well enough to be released. If you just release it without any guarantees or claims about its goodness, sure you might get bashed all over the internet, but also a lot of people would use it and modify it for themselves, and maybe some of said improvements might be useful to you. The YC admissions cycle is over, so maybe you have time to do this now. ",1176312474

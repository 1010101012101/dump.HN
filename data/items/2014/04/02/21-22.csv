7519369,comment,7514651,7518240,2,0,aslakhellesoy,,,"I completely agree with you that the most important value with BDD and Specification by Example happens during conversations at a whiteboard.<p>Cucumber/Fit/high level tests aren&#x27;t fundamentally less refactorable. They have a looser coupling to code than unit tests, so when the production code is refactored they are less affected than xUnit tests.<p>The problem most people make is that they are trying to cover too much with Cucumber. And they use it <i>solely</i> as an automation tool without any collaboration whatsoever. That doesn&#x27;t work, but it&#x27;s difficult to get that message across to people.<p>In order for Cucumber and Specification by Example to be used well it is essential to provide tooling that appeals to the most critical piece of the collaboration puzzle: The business analysts (or the people with the requirements).<p>Nobody has solved this problem yet, but I think it is a solvable problem.

This audit was commissioned by us and concerns a pre-release version of Cryptocat for iPhone.

First, I think it would be useful for you to define what you actually want to learn. There is a difference in what has traditionally been called &quot;AI&quot; and what is called &quot;Machine Learning&quot; today. While these two fields are related and some people say that ML is a subfield of AI, both tend to focus on very different problems. Today, &quot;Machine Learning&quot; has taken a lot of the attention away from traditional AI (mainly due to the lack of results in making truly intelligent machines)<p>Here are some topics I think of when hearing AI vs. Machine Learning:<p>AI<p>- Robotics<p>- Intelligent Machines, e.g. for question answering<p>- Natural Language understanding (Not NLP, I mean <i>understanding</i>)<p>- Game playing/planning<p>Machine Learning<p>- Making predictions (Often synonymous with &quot;big data analytics&quot; these days)<p>- Recommendation Systems<p>- Finding Patterns (Data Mining)<p>- &quot;Data Science&quot; techniques<p>In Machine Learning, Python is the de-facto standard language both in Academia and Industry, mainly because because of its excellent libraries. In terms of resources, I can also highly recommend the Coursera ML class, as well as statistics classes to get started. From there you can dive deeper into any of the topics you are interested in.",1396475590

Women in general are not as well represented, someone looking for a women as a role model would have to look harder to find someone. To that end, a highly represented group doesn&#x27;t need special consideration to be included, they are heavily included already.<p>> For the same reason that it would be a problem to only want male role models for male children. It reinforces existing problems and stereotypes, prevents social connections across demographics, limits group knowledge cross pollination, and limits the students&#x27; access to whoever is the best mentor available in the case that that mentor does not match them demographically.<p>Nobody is arguing that role models should be limited. Indeed, if this person&#x27;s daughter pursues STEM they will likely have a man as a role model at some point since they are well represented.

I think there is a tendency to make that claim because we want it to be true :)<p>Python is such a nice language that we want to use it for everything.  But I found I became more productive once I got out of that mindset.  Right now, I have a very multilingual workflow including Python, R, shell scripts, C++, and a handful of other DSLs (various sql dialects, html templating, etc.)<p>I feel like I am finally productive working with data; I was always astounded by how MUCH code you have to write to work with data.  There is a pretty big cost to learning all of that, and I won&#x27;t lie and say I learned R quickly, but it was worth it.<p>I use Python to interface with MANY systems, often to generate cleanly formatted CSV files.  R reads the CSV files and does data slicing and dicing (using the data.table package, an enhanced data frame).  And then ggplot2 for plotting.  And C++ for the big data stuff, and shell scripts to glue it all together (with concurrent processes, importantly).<p>I find that this Unix-style architecture is actually more maintainable in the long run.  Parts of your analysis and data cleaning become more modular and reusable.  There are a lot of reasons why a boatload of Python packages aren&#x27;t very cleanly reusable.  You also end up with MUCH less code using the multi-language strategy vs. trying to do it all in one language (I&#x27;ve seen people try to do that both with Python and R).<p>ggplot2 is unrivaled; Python and Julia people are busily trying to copy it.  Python and Julia are both also copying R&#x27;s data frame structure.  The area is moving extremely quickly now, so I&#x27;ll be interested to see what progress they make.  But there are actually areas where R the language is more suited to data analysis (has more of a Scheme core than Python, more appropriate data structures, lazy expression evaluation, etc.)<p>In the end I am using R for the same reason I chose to use Python over C/C++ -- because it enables you to write 5x less code (in the domain of data analysis, compared with Python).  And once you use other tools, you see Python&#x27;s flaws, like bad package management (R&#x27;s is actually better), and a relatively bad REPL.  And Python&#x27;s C++-inspired class system is often a hindrance for data analysis; R is a more data-oriented language.<p>R definitely has its problems, including a lot of horrible R code out there.  But it also has a lot more books and so forth.  IMO data.table + ggplot2 alone make it worth it.  I recommend reading Hadley Wickam&#x27;s papers on &quot;tidy data&quot; and the &quot;split-apply-combine&quot; style of analysis.  In that sense learning R actually helps you learn how to do data analysis properly.",1396473636

IMHO, the two standout items are launch abort handling and docking, but there are a whole bunch of other stuff you&#x27;d want as well (in terms of life support, advanced communications, etc.).<p>On these two items:<p>NASA doesn&#x27;t want crew in the Dragon capsule until it has a launch abort system (LAS) that would let it get away from a failing booster rocket.  The current design involves much stronger versions of the orbital thrusters; this is scheduled for tests this summer.<p>Also, the cargo Dragon doesn&#x27;t currently dock autonomously with the ISS; instead, it effectively parks itself close enough for the station&#x27;s robot arm to grab it and move it to a berthing port.  When Dragon leaves, the process is reversed --- meaning that the arm and its support systems need to be operating in order for the spacecraft to leave.  In normal operations, that&#x27;s manageable --- but one of the things you want in a crew transport is that it be able to leave a failing station quickly in an emergency.  The berthing arrangement doesn&#x27;t really suit.<p>NASA is planning to deal with that by adding new docking hardware to the station, and mounting compatible hardware on the Commercial Crew vehicles (whoever winds up winning that competition).

Well, then you have to take the goofy giant trackpad and lose the dedicated trackpoint buttons. And there&#x27;s a numpad you&#x27;ll never use, too, making the main keyboard off-sided.  Want a different keyboard layout? Well then you can&#x27;t get the nicer rez or 16GB of RAM.<p>In an ideal world I&#x27;d be able to upgrade a laptop the way I&#x27;ve upgraded desktops:  Better CPU available? Swap it in!.  Nicer keyboard? Go use it.<p>Ideally the display, main CPU/motherboard, and keyboard would all be separate things.  I long for the day when my &quot;phone&quot; is powerful and flexible enough that it can be used as a &quot;laptop&quot; by way of wireless keyboard and larger display.<p>The laptop under discussion isn&#x27;t for me, but I love the idea of it.",1396473499

E.g. the drug war might be a great injustice, but the entire budget of the federal prison system is only $6-7 billion. The militarization of the police is, economically, more than outweighed by the dramatic shrinking of our actual military. In 1970, there was 1 federal uniformed military person for every 65 people. Today it&#x27;s 1 for every 203. We might have a war on terror, but back then we had a war on communism, and defense spending as a percentage of GDP has fallen from 8% in 1970 to 5% today. The number of regulations might be more, but that&#x27;s a worthless measure. The federal administrative bureaucracy writing and overseeing and enforcing those regulations has shrunk dramatically. In 1970, there was 1 federal civilian employee for every 69 people. Today there is 1 for every 117 people.",1396473131

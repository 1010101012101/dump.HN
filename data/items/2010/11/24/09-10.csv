Another one is recommendations. When one person suddenly is getting 2-3 recommendations from colleagues, they are usually on their way out. If a lot of people from the same company is getting recommendations left and right from each other, the  company is either going down or there is serious downsizing  imminent. Very interesting side effect of sites like LinkedIn.",1290592709

What do you mean by ""directly render"", ""application-level X11 clients"", ""they"", and ""server""?<p>Perhaps you were suggesting that remotely displaying a window of, say, FrameMaker in your browser would be better done by rasterizing the application window on the same machine where FrameMaker was running, as with Xvnc, only as a browser plugin.<p>That is indeed a workable and fairly simple solution, but it usually uses a lot more bandwidth on the network and memory on the machine running FrameMaker than just running X11, particularly with LBX or ssh compressing the X11 protocol.",1290592666

1936960,comment,1936909,1936937,0,0,Robin_Message,,,"I think that was the idea of Scala — to provide all of the modern language features in one language so that you don't have to decide between, say, Java libraries or higher-kinded types or actors. You get them all, you can mix and match. This is powerful because it gives a good basis to test any new feature on a substrate that already has all the existing ones.<p>I think this lack of an arbitrary feature boundary makes it a useful research language. However, for the same reason, I imagine it's not so good in production — it's like Perl with ""more than one way to do it,"" but now you need a PhD [1] to understand several of the myriad ways of doing things.<p>[1] You don't need a PhD, but I'm guessing only a very small proportion of working programmers know what, e.g. a higher-kinded type is.",1290592564

Just because a more refined, and rather more complex theory, comes along a few centuries later doesn't invalidate the fact that if you stay within the boundaries of the where it is known to be perfectly valid it is the best thing to use.<p>When you model some physical system you do it with and end in mind and a lot of assumptions have to be made (e.g. that gas flow is non-turbulent, heat flow is uniform) which are all <i>wrong</i> in some sense because reality isn't like that but if you didn't make these simplifying assumptions then you'd never get anything done.<p>Mathematical models aren't reality - they are an attempt to create structures that allow us to explain and predict and the assumptions underlying the mappings between these structures and reality are just as important as the contents of the theories themselves. It's possible to model the same system in umpteen different ways - indeed as there is no all encompassing theory-of-absolutely-everything you have to make some important decisions when you model something as to what is relevant. Trying to model plate tectonics in terms of string theory is unlikely to get you very far - that doesn't make string theory ""wrong"".",1290591828

Recently I see a bit of 'backpedaling' in that department.<p>I guess by now there's a team at Google working on a replacement for the Java Android development environment, to be able to move away from what is now a tainted platform, so it's all perfectly understandable, and I can understand they need to phase in this transformation to not create shocks in the Android ecosystem; but I still feel a bit manipulated, being talked to in a way that both parties know is doublespeak but nobody being able to do anything about it.",1290591378

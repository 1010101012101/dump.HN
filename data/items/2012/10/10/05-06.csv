4635231,comment,4631607,4633675,4,0,joshlegs,,,"I have to agree with you. In so many careers your performance is subjective. The cool thing about programming, to me, is that when there's something wrong, it's <i>objectively</i> wrong, meaning it can be fixed. Sure you might be able to 'fix' things more quickly or less quickly than someone else, or implement a solution better or worse. But the product you create pretty much either works or doesn't work.",1349848585

And I found the detail and data sources in the rant very persuasive that Microsoft's actions were no more nor less 'good' than Apple's efforts at dumping late breaking fixes into the market.<p>I read a great exposition on Gamasutra once which very crisply derided game companies for 'squeezing' a couple more months of development time by putting out what was beta quality at best CD's with games on them during the 'shopping rush' and having a patch available basically Christmas day when most of those sales would be unwrapped and installed. High speed internet is a curse for folks who want to play 'old' games from that period, since the 'real' game, the one that was the best build, can no longer be downloaded as a patch from the manufacturer. But it didn't need to call out specific manufacturers, just example games.<p>So I find calling out MG Seigler to be unnecessary, as the exemplar author of a poorly articulated piece sure, but as part of the argument on whether or not big after ship patches are 'good' or 'bad', well it doesn't add value for me. I know, I'm too sensitized to this stuff and should just ignore and move on.",1349847385

It has forced me to rethink what I have written which is almost always a good thing, and in this case I believe it to be good.<p>What you have made clear to me is that I made a mistake in my interpretation of the OPs post.  I had incorrectly assumed that he believed that to become a good programmer that you had to be pessimistic.<p>What he actually said was (not quoted) in order to be a good programmer he needed to adopt a certain mindset, which was to focus on the negatives.  He believes this mindset is slowly making him unhappy because it is constantly reminding him of all the mistakes he made throughout the day, every work day, of every year.<p>I did overgeneralize his problem, and that was my mistake.  I still contend that his problem is temporary and that he should not worry about it as it is a natural part of growing as a developer.<p>After reading his post a second time I realized something.  He doesn't just think of tracking down bugs as focusing on the negatives, but he considers the bugs to be an actual list of his failures.  Any bug to him is a failure at any point in development.  No wonder he is upset.  What is a bug to you?  To me a bug in the wild is a huge, huge embarrassment.  I feel just awful when one sneaks by.  But a bug caught in development is nothing more than a logical typo.  If you are a writer and you publish an article incorrectly switching you're with your, or their with there, you would feel dumb.  But if it happened while you are burning through your first draft?  Is this a failure?  No just a minor mistake that you can resolve relatively quickly.<p>The solution to feeling bad about bugs is not to think positively about bugs, but simply not to worry about them.  They will happen, you will catch them, and you will get better.  I'd like to elaborate more on how doing nothing will fix the problem. I will probably do so tomorrow even though these comments will probably be dead.  Thanks for going back and forth with me, it was fun.",1349847343

I had to do it as an undergrad (studied manufacturing). Running a proper CAD system (CATIA, NX, ProEngineer, Solidworks, AutoCAD, etc) is a basic requirement of many traditional engineering jobs.<p>As for 'additive manufacturing engineer', I don't see that title coming up soon. What are commonly known around here as ""3D printers"" are more often called ""rapid prototypers"" in industry. That's about all they're used for-prototyping, not production. Additive processes such as fused deposition modeling aren't able to reach (note even close for the most part) the throughput and detail abilities that other process using the same materials are, such as injection molding or rotomolding. If a company was using 3D printers to make a product they were selling to customers, they are best off selling it for a very high price and making relatively few of them. Otherwise, if they need low per unit costs or large throughputs, there are other ways to make what they need to sell.",1349847264

I really like the Smalltalk method calling style they've used, and you can still use C to mess with pointers if you know what you are doing. If one learned Objective-C first it shouldn't be <i>that</i> difficult to switch to any other object-oriented language, other than memorizing the order of variables in every method. (Also, retain/release is hardly uncommon and with ARC the programmer can basically act like everything is garbage collected anyway.)<p>That aside, the price of entry to run on iOS is an excellent objection, as is (to some degree) the lack of code portability. I don't know how simple GNUStep is to get running, but it's certainly not as ubiquitous as all the JVMs.",1349845975

You'd end up with a few cents from the state (for the USB keys, pennies to the dollar) and absolutely no recourse.<p>I would highly recommend getting a 2nd safe deposit box with a different bank and store the exact same contents in both (or better, get 3+ total and use m-of-n encryption... but in reality the effort involved would not be practical unless you rarely dip into offline funds).<p>PS: you're saying I only need to search banks in the bay area for one with that color scheme, floor tile, and banker, then drill/blast the box shown and make off with 90% of Coinbase's deposits in untraceable cash?

4635124,comment,4631607,4633063,1,0,kirbysayshi,,,"Something that struck me from your comment is that yes, there are more serious repercussions than others. The problem here is that the pressure and feedback from those repercussions is relative, and knowing this makes it especially difficult to accept tons of negativity. If a bug caused someone to die, and this was preventable (i.e. obviously your fault) then yes, you should feel horrible. Most of our jobs though, involve loss of money, not loss of life. The pressure to fulfill these tasks is therefore completely constructed. Success or positive feedback is simply that the people paying you continue to make money, the status quo continues.<p>Being optimistic or pessimistic isn't quite relevant when people's lives are on the line, I think it's more about being _realistic_. Everything can fail, and everyone makes mistakes. This is reality. When people can die, there is much more impetus to pay (time and money) for everything to be triple-checked and triple-redundant.<p>But in pretty typical software development, that money and time isn't there. And the feeling of knowing you could have done better, if only given a chance, is horrible and eats away at your resolve. Then you wonder, ""well perhaps I'm not fighting strongly enough,"" or ""People are coding for space shuttles, and I can't even get this page to load!""<p>I believe it's a human right that your individual problems are no greater than another's, because it's relative. If you feel about it strongly enough, then it's valid. Saying it's not because people's lives aren't at risk is invalidating the human right of pursuit of happiness.",1349845405

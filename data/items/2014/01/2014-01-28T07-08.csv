I am now working on a new product suite whilst continuing to consult.<p>The Mortgage Portal was an online marketplace for mortgage brokers to find appropriate products for their customers. It started with an idea that I spent a month building in my spare time. I worked with a colleague (both of us consulting in the mortgage technology arena) to bring it to market.<p>I started with a flexible mortgage that I drew salary against - so £0 capital. We then went around hawking the idea to the marketplace. We met a lot of resistance from established players (owned by the big banks, so no way we could disrupt the marketplace), and in the end pivoted into a platform for new lenders to get to market quickly. We helped a handful of banks launch new channels in a few months, which was a great selling point. Then came the downturn.<p>Our sales model was monthly fee + per transaction fee. It was never profitable.<p>We didn&#x27;t look at grants/loans. There are some around, but my opinion is they are probably a distraction at this stage. If you&#x27;re interested look at <a href=""http://www.j4bgrants.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.j4bgrants.co.uk/</a> - they have a wealth of information.<p>The most valuable thing we did was pivot. We didn&#x27;t pivot fast enough which made things untenable.\nWe never scaled (started with two, ended with just me), and we failed for various reasons. I could blame the market - all our remaining customers either went bankrupt or closed within the space of a few days - but the reality was that the idea was just a starting point and we didn&#x27;t move from that.<p>In my view, if you have an idea, your first step is to go out there and find a customer. Don&#x27;t build anything (that is the easy bit) before you have someone willing to give you money. We should&#x27;ve done that - taken the idea and then asked what our customers wanted to do with it - rather than impose our views on them.<p>As for resources, there are many available and it will depend on what your trying to achieve and where you&#x27;re located. If in London, I&#x27;d recommend the Google Campus (<a href=""http://www.campuslondon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.campuslondon.com/</a>) as a good starting point.

7135833,comment,7134433,7135273,119,0,patio11,,,"I have <i>intimate</i> personal experience with the FCRA.  Sadly I don&#x27;t have an hour to talk about it at the moment, but ping me any time.  Short version: it&#x27;s one of the most <i>absurdly</i> customer-friendly pieces of legislation in the US, assuming you know how to work it.  There exist Internet communities where they basically do nothing but assist each other with using the FCRA to get <i>legitimate</i> debts removed from their credit report, which, when combined with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, means you can essentially unilaterally absolve yourself of many debts if the party currently owning it is not on the ball for compliance.<p>The brief version, with the exact search queries you&#x27;ll want bracketed: you send a [debt validation letter] under the FCRA to the CRAs.  This starts a 30 day clock, during which time they have to get to the reporter and receive evidence from the reporter that you actually own the debt.  If that clock expires, the CRAs <i>must</i> remove that tradeline from your report and never reinstate it.  Roughly simultaneously with that letter, you send the collection agency a [FDCPA dispute letter], and allege specifically that you have &quot;No recollection of the particulars of the debt&quot; (this stops short of saying &quot;It isn&#x27;t mine&quot;), request documentation of it, and -- this is the magic part -- remind them that the FDCPA means they have to stop collection activities until they&#x27;ve produced docs for you.  <i>Collection activities include responding to inquiries from the CRAs.</i>  If the CRA comes back to you with a &quot;We validated the debt with the reporter.&quot; prior to you hearing from the reporter directly, you&#x27;ve got documentary evidence of a per-se violation of the FDCPA, which you can use to get the debt discharged and statutory damages (if you sue) or just threaten to do that in return for the reporter agreeing to tell the CRA to delete the tradeline.<p>No response from the CRA?  You watch your mail box like a hawk for the next 30 days.  Odds are, you&#x27;ll get nothing back from the reporter in that timeframe, because most debt collection agencies are poorly organized and can&#x27;t find the original documentation for the debt in their files quickly enough.  Many simply won&#x27;t have original documentation -- they just have a CSV file from the original lender listing people and amounts.<p>If you get nothing back from the reporter in 30 days, game over, you win.  The CRA is now legally required to delete the tradeline and never put it back.  Sometimes you have to send a few pieces of mail to get this to stick.  You will probably follow-up on this with a second letter to the reporter, asserting the FDCPA right to not receive any communication from them which is inconvenient, and you&#x27;ll tell them that <i>all</i> communication is inconvenient.  (This letter is sometimes referred to as a [FOAD letter], for eff-off-and-die.)  The reporter&#x27;s only possible choices at that point are to abandon collection attempts entirely or sue you.  If they sue you prior to sending validation, that was a very bad move, because that is a per-se FDCPA violation and means your debt will be voided.  (That assumes you owe it in the first place.  Lots of the people doing these mechanics actually did owe the debt at one point, but are betting that it <i>can&#x27;t be conveniently demonstrated</i> that they owe the debt.)<p>If the reporter sends a letter: &quot;Uh, we have you in a CSV file.&quot; you wait patiently until day 31 then say &quot;You&#x27;ve failed to produce documentary evidence of this debt under the FDCPA.  Accordingly, you&#x27;re barred from attempting to collect on it.  If you dispute that this is how the FDCPA works, meet me in any court of competent jurisdiction because I have the certified mail return receipt from the letter I sent you and every judge in the United States can count to 30.&quot; and then you file that with the CRA alleging &quot;This debt on my credit report is <i>invalid</i>.&quot; The CRA will get in touch with the debt collection company, have their attempt timeout, and nuke the trade line.  You now still technically speaking owe money but you owe it to someone who can&#x27;t collect on the debt, (licitly [+]) sell it, or report it against your credit.<p>I just outlined the semi-abusive use of those two laws, but the perfectly legitimate use (for resolving situations like mine, where my credit report was alleging that I owed $X00,000 in debts dating to before I was born) is structurally similar.  My dropbox still has 30 PDFs for letters I sent to the 3 CRAs, several banks, and a few debt collection companies disputing the information on my report and taking polite professional notice that there was an easy way out of this predicament for them but that if they weren&#x27;t willing to play ball on that I was well aware of the mechanics of the hard way.<p>[+] Owing more to disorganization and incompetence than malice, many debt collection companies will in fact sell debts which they&#x27;re not longer legally entitled to.  This happened to me twice.  I sent out two &quot;intent to sue&quot; letters and they fixed the problem within a week.<p>[Edit: I last did this in 2006 and my recollection on some of the steps I took was faulty, so I&#x27;ve corrected them above and made it a little more flow-charty.]",1390893569

Because the number of states that a cpp-machine can visit is finite, it is easy to construct a TM (or even an FSM) that halts on all inputs but produces a different output than any given cpp machine for some input.  For example, a TM can do bignum arithmetic that halts on all inputs, but for some input it must be the case that such a TM will produce a different output than any given FSM, and hence any given cpp-machine, since cpp-machines are strictly less powerful than FSMs.",1390893501

I agree with all that - and it needs to change.<p>But too often I see people using the stupidity of US drug policy as an excuse for all sorts of morally reprehensible deeds.

Is that in the spirit of libertarian ideology? Is that about protesting US drug policy or is it just Ullbricht&#x27;s greed?<p>People will go through all sorts of mental gymnastics in order to rationalize their personal appetites. In the end the consumers of drugs have to know that they are buying from people who either engage in violence themselves or work for someone who does, and because they are participating in this marketplace they are in some way partially responsible for the violence that occurs because of it.

1547625,comment,1546500,1547591,0,0,rdl,,,"I don't disagree that the media has done a horrible job of reporting on Iraq/Afghanistan.<p>However, I think you really overestimate the downrange reporting coming from Vietnam (I don't know how old you are; the war was over before I was born, so I only read about it after the fact).<p>There was definitely a lot of focus on US casualties.  We were losing about 300 per week, whereas now it is more like 300 per quarter or per year.<p>The main difference was in Vietnam, the journalists had free reign to go anywhere in the allied area they wished; in Iraq/Afghanistan, reporters are generally embedded with a specific unit.  Maybe psychologically embedding with the unit makes reports identify with the soldiers more.<p>The only really stunning difference between Vietnam and Iraq/Afghanistan was down to Walter Cronkite giving his opinion that the war would end in stalemate.  I don't think very many other Vietnam war reporters (from Vietnam; not US based) gave personal commentary like that.  I think that is down to Walter Cronkite as a person, and that he had experience with a previous war (he flew on bombers and covered landings during WW2) before reporting on Vietnam.  None of the embedded reporters in Afghanistan or Iraq covered a major war other than Gulf War I before (Anderson Cooper, Geraldo, Christiane Amanpour, etc.)",1280141505

Likening an invading military force (especially when there was no reason for the invasion as is the case in Iraq) is pretty insulting to everyone involved except, of course, the invading force.<p>>There are definitely people in Iraq and Afghanistan who have had family members killed, but who overall are still happy the US invaded.<p>This <i>might</i> be the case in Afghanistan (I can buy that you might find someone somewhere, but I doubt the average Joe is very happy about it) but you're going to have a hard time finding someone ""better off"" in Iraq after the invasion.  The country is less stable, less safe.  There are extremist roaming around kidnapping and killing that were not doing so before.  I've met several families that had decent lives in Iraq that had to leave after the invasion.<p>> There was one report about a guy who had a US bomb hit his house, killing several family members, who then went to the US commander, told him what had happened, and asked that we be more careful and continue to get rid of the Taliban.<p>Were they <i>two</i> such reports?  What was the source of this story?  Was due diligence done on the story?  Sounds too patriotic/""feel good"" for me to take it at face value.<p>>and in a lot of ways, even at the peak of badness in each place, outside of localized areas, quality of life is better for most civilians.<p>In the case of Iraq this is demonstrably not true.  In fact the situation is almost exactly the opposite.  What do you think Sadam was doing exactly?  He was for sure a bad person and not someone who's radar you want to be on but for the average citizen there were definitely worse people to have as a ruler (e.g. Kim Jong-il).<p>>The US has killed maybe 200 Afghan civilians in about a decade of operations.<p>Based on what definition?  The one you gave elsewhere about following US military protocol?  My definition of civilian death is if a non-American who isn't a terrorist gets killed, regardless if the people who killed him where within their protocols or not.  If they hadn't been there the person would likely still be alive.  Given that definition your ""200 in 10 years"" sounds impossibly low.<p>>There are definitely grounds for not wanting the US to be there, but they're more ""moral"" or ""honor"" than practical quality of life, for most people.<p>This statement could only possibly hold for Afghanistan.  Clearly it doesn't apply to Iraq.",1280141205

1547614,comment,1543057,1547545,0,0,Natsu,,,"Depends on which pattern you're talking about.  I was talking about inverting everything and using the magic of $_ everywhere.<p>If you mean just the idea of using a hash to mark things you've seen before, though, that is very, very useful.  But I would write it as:<p>foreach $item (@list) {\n  # Print every item in the list skipping duplicate items.\n  print $item unless $seen{$item}++;\n}<p>Because then I don't have to think about what's happening with all the magic $_ variables Perl is tossing around.  Sure, they're convenient.  And I do use them some of the time.  But when things break, I'm usually glad that I was explicit about what I was doing rather than relying on Perl's magic to know what I intended to do.<p>Maybe that's why I like Perl so much?  I tend to code in as strictly disciplined a manner as I can manage, so I don't end up regretting it later.",1280140835

I never learned so much about running a company as I did after reading Gerber's ""E-Myth Revisited"" and then starting out on my own company.  Rather than go corporate, I recommend poring over the org charts and business models of several different kinds of businesses and follow the money.  Figure out why they have hired the people they do and what function they serve in the nitty-gritty to serve the overall vision of the company.  How do they make a customer? How do they deliver?  When you can map each of these out on paper in the nitty-gritty, then you are ready to think about your own company, I say.  But working in the corporate world will not necessarily help you with that.  It will, however, give you contacts and a network that you can leverage.  In addition to Gerber's book, I encourage you to take to heart Felix Dennis' ""How to Get Rich"", wherein he takes up the matter of working for someone else only enough to learn the business inside out so you can compete with them.",1280140801

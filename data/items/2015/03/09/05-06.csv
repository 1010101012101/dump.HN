9169409,comment,9168608,9169041,0,0,lotharbot,,,"* &quot;Seattle is incredibly friendly and polite&quot;<p>My ten-year residence in Seattle (U District, Lake City, and Burien/Tukwila) led me to use terms like &quot;passive-aggressive&quot;, &quot;frigid&quot;, and &quot;unaware&quot;.<p>Seattle drivers are particularly terrible -- they&#x27;ll force a line of 20 cars to stop just so they can &quot;politely&quot; let someone in who would have been able to turn just fine ten seconds later when all the cars had passed; they&#x27;re perfectly willing to inconvenience multiple other people in order to be superficially polite to one.  If there&#x27;s a space in front of them, they&#x27;ll speed up, getting right on the bumper of the car in front of them -- even if there&#x27;s plenty of room to pass -- and then follow closely, as if they just can&#x27;t stand being more than a few yards behind the next car.  (This particular passive-aggressive maneuver is so distinctive that I once identified a vehicle on the interstate in Kansas as &quot;drives like they&#x27;re from Seattle&quot; from a distance, confirming from the licence plate when I got closer.)<p>I also noticed that everyone in Seattle was polite to my face, but the majority of long-term friends I made while in Seattle were from other places.  The people who turned out to be fake friends were mostly the natives.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that Seattle entirely sucks.  It was a neat place to live, and there are a lot of good people there.  But I find it interesting how differently we perceive the same social scene, and how that contributes to my being much happier far away from there.",1425880774

I am familiar with the justifications for targeting Japanese civilians for conventional and nuclear bombing though, something along the lines of Japan being prepared for total war - down to child combatants with sharpened sticks.  In war you have two options for ending hostilities, complete annihilation or political resolution (surrender, cease fire, etc).  If Japan went into total war mode, and they made it clear that they would if necessary, then they remove the political resolution option.  So with that in mind, it is not a stretch to say that firebombing and nuking hundreds of thousands saved millions of Japanese lives.<p>Consider the fact that this firebombing occurred 1945-03-09, and the Japanese were still wanting to fight for another five months, until the second atomic bomb drop on 1945-08-09.  The only thing that brought them to the table was the idea that their enemy possessed a weapon where a single bomb could level a city, they had no idea how many atomic bombs existed.",1425878607

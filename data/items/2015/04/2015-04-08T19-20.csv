There is a reference server implementation at <a href=""https://github.com/github/lfs-test-server"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/github/lfs-test-server</a>.<p>This isn&#x27;t about this particular instance (Github&#x27;s LFS), but in general, a &quot;reference implementation&quot; isn&#x27;t the same thing as having an open protocol.<p>Having a reference implementation without a proper specification means that any other implementations have to re-implement the existing reference implementation, <i>including</i> any bugs. The purpose of a specification is to outline <i>undefined</i> behavior as much as it is to outline defined behavior. That is, the specification says, &quot;these are the portions of the program which you may <i>not</i> rely on&quot;.<p>We&#x27;ve seen this happen in some languages in which a particular implementation is either the <i>de facto</i> or <i>de jure</i> standard. Other compilers or interpreters end up having to mimic their bugs when it comes to things like arithmetic overflow/precision errors, because developers have come to rely on the language behaving one way, in the absence of any clear rules telling them otherwise[0].<p>[0] Not that developers may not rely on things that a specification explicitly tells them not to - there are plenty of examples of this too - but at least then it&#x27;s possible to say determine either that a particular program will run on any standards-compliant implementation, or that it is implementation-specific.",1428523181

Not only do they want to watch what they want, whenever they want, anywhere and on any device they choose, they want YouTube features built specifically with their needs in mind. Over the past several months, we’ve taken bold new steps to bring these experiences to life. Since inviting hundreds of thousands of fans into our YouTube Music Key Beta, we&#x27;ve seen tremendous engagement. And we&#x27;ve seen an equally enthusiastic response for our new YouTube Kids app, designed to give families a simpler and safer video-viewing experience – it’s already crossed 2 million installations in less than a month.<p>We’re excited to build on this momentum by taking another big step in favour of choice: offering fans an ad-free version of YouTube for a monthly fee. By creating a new paid offering, we’ll generate a new source of revenue that will supplement your fast growing advertising revenue.<p>So what’s next?<p>Launching a new paid offering will require us to update your terms through your Creator Studio Dashboard – a process that should feel familiar to anyone who went through a similar process three years ago when we began distributing and monetizing your content on mobile devices. Today, mobile represents over half of all watchtime and mobile revenue has increased by 200% in the last year. Just as with mobile, we’re confident that this latest contract update will excite your fans and generate a previously untapped, additional source of revenue for you. Please look out for our notification, review it and let us know your thoughts.<p>It’s an exciting year for YouTube, as we push ourselves into uncharted territories. But we continue to be guided by a desire to deliver the choices fans want and the revenue you need. By working closely with you, we know it’ll be a successful journey.<p>The YouTube Team",1428523095

Sometimes they also include checksum information which would invalidate any attempt to merge.<p>How far do you take the decompression?  For raster images, you&#x27;ll probably have to decompress all the way to bitmap because the same image could have multiple completely different binary representations in a format like png.<p>How do you diff changes? If we have a raster image and one person changes one thing by a small amount, say increases brightness 1%, this could alter every pixel of the image!  How would you detect that change and interleave it with something like a contrast adjustment of 1% that could also change every pixel? Sure, the merger would still have to choose which adjustment goes first if the changes aren&#x27;t independent, but how would they know that&#x27;s what changed? I.e. how would the diff tool know that the changes are &quot;brightness +1%&quot; and &quot;contrast +1%&quot; and not some other arbitrary number of adjustments?",1428523036

He built a successful IT business at 25, - in a country where it&#x27;s very difficult to do. A self-made man. This fact made me nervous and caused a deep and long depression. I&#x27;m not ambitious in common meaning of this term but I think I&#x27;m smart enough and I always thought I&#x27;m smarter than others. And I&#x27;m also 80lvl procrastinator :) also now I&#x27;m 33.<p>The solution to the depression was external and not related to my &#x27;career&#x27; (I&#x27;m self-employeed) or better self-organisation. Instead, the solution came with long-distance running, positive thinking and yoga. I healed mentally and now I&#x27;m much more stable. I use this guy and his success as a measure of how healthy I am. If I don&#x27;t care - that means I&#x27;m ok. If I care about his &#x27;success&#x27; - that means I should rest more, spend more time on open air or eat healthier food.<p>So I would recommend you to invest more in your mental health.<p>P.S.

I think that usefulness is also significantly curtailed by current battery life. The fact that the Apple Watch can&#x27;t be relied on to remain useful for even a single 24 hour day would lead me to call the battery life extremely short regardless of other wearables are doing.

What&#x27;s in doubt is whether it is behavior which the rest of us should put up with; market dominance is not the end-all, be-all arbiter of desirable behavior, at least not to me.<p>(+: Some people will try to get rid of this kind of behavior purely by arguing that it in fact harms an employer&#x27;s productivity (via burning out their employees). This may be tactically effective, but I think it frames the debate on the wrong terms, conceding too much of the argument at the start; it allows for just as much abuse as maximizes productivity.

Part of the reason is that SCP depends on transitive reachability.  And of course part of the reason is that SCP is built on top of the Internet, so can already assume a basically running network underneath.<p>I can&#x27;t predict the future, but I do think it is likely that a bunch of de facto important players will emerge and have fairly complete pairwise dependencies.  One reason is that Stellar follows a gateway model, where counterparties issue credits.  So for example, down the line people might want to store their money as Chase or Citibank USD credits.  So people will already have some notion that some participants are trustworthy enough to hold their USD deposits, and these institutions will emerge as important.  If I&#x27;m a Citibank customer and you send me money, I obviously won&#x27;t consider the payment complete until Citibank says it is.  And of course Citibank is likely to want to depend on a bunch of institutions they do business with, so even just one bank should give me good transitive reachability.<p>But the nice thing about safety is that you can reduce any individual party&#x27;s trust by depending on more people.  So for example Stellar will run a validator node for the foreseeable future, and their incentives are different from Citibank&#x27;s.

Physical materials, the materials libraries have built their workflows and budgets around, operate using different rules. Wholesalers will provide discounts because libraries buy lots of stuff and so better discounts mean moving more materials and, more importantly, stopping customers from going to another wholesaler. E-books have no wholesaler. They are controlled by the publisher so there is no going to a competitor for better pricing. Thus higher prices (in the realm of 3x the retail hardcover).<p>That said, publishers have been lowering prices and increasing access slowly. Along with being competitors, libraries are customers, and big ones. Public libraries buy more that 1 billion in materials a year.

Git-LFS seems to use small metadata pointer files (SHA256 hash, file size, git-lfs version) instead of symlinks.  Not sure whether the files reside in something like the .git/annex/ dir; I&#x27;m guessing the do or there wouldn&#x27;t be those pointer files.<p>You can clone a repo without having to download the files.<p>With git-annex you can sync between non-bare and bare repositories without having a central server.
Git-LFS seems to have a separate server for binaries.  It looks like it may act like a git-annex special remote rather than git-annex&#x27;s usage of synced/master branch.<p>Git-annex repos share information about the locations of annex files, how many repos contain a given file, etc.  You can trust and un-trust repos.

People will the lottery every week. In business that happens too. Look at all the well funded startups which never amount to anything, and factor in the prestige, earnings and opportunity those companies afford their participants. Plenty of people are early employees of hot startups simply via friendships and connections. Many of them leave or are fired. Many of those people become vastly wealthy.<p>Moreover look at all the one-hit wonders and luck is an even greater factor. If people who are smart, talented and able can reproduce their success why are they so rare? When someone never manages to get close to their initial success lack is often in play. It&#x27;s not that they weren&#x27;t clever, or didn&#x27;t work hard, but it can be that luck picked them from a field of very similar people.<p>That shouldn&#x27;t of course change your behavior. Luck is beyond our locus of control and planning for it, or around it, is like planning around a potential meteorite strike, or rain.<p>Anything you can force via effort isn&#x27;t luck which is why people get confused. You can achieve against the odds via hard work alone which is why working hard is worthwhile.<p>You can also scale your success. The difference between making a living, making a million and being Mark Zuckerberg can all be attracted to work and wit without the need to factor luck into the equation at all.<p>Finally we&#x27;re all focused on good-luck. Bad luck is the real enemy. To be diagnosed with a serious illness, or to be unable to take an opportunity due to factors you cannot effect will cut the legs out from underneath you however hard you work.

9343359,comment,9340792,9340792,0,0,atroyn,,,"Yes. I did it, and here&#x27;s exactly how:<p>Right now you get a nice dopamine rush when you start something, but as soon as it gets a little tricky, you quit and go looking for the next thing that gives you a dopamine rush. Productivity has no value for you, because it doesn&#x27;t make you happy - you&#x27;re stuck in a local minima. So what do you do? You have to go through a period of suck to get to the much, much bigger reward.<p>This is exactly the same as dieting, exersise, learning to draw, learning a musical instrument, anything.<p>Here&#x27;s how:<p>- Recognise that productivity and motivation are not related.<p>A lot of people will tell you that the way to be productive is to find something you&#x27;re passionate about, or only work on things that motivate you, or that the only way to be productive is by working on something that makes you happy all the time. That&#x27;s garbage. Every productive person has periods where they feel like what they&#x27;re doing sucks. Motivation will get you started, it will point the way, but it will absolutely not keep you going.<p>- Recognise that discipline beats motivation.<p>Discipline boils down to accepting that something is going to suck, then doing it anyway. Don&#x27;t try to convince yourself it doesn&#x27;t suck, because it does. Don&#x27;t try to convince yourself you love it, you don&#x27;t. But you have to do it anyway. A lot of people think discipline is about willpower, as if you can will yourself to do something that sucks. You can&#x27;t. Discipline is about submission to the task at hand. If you like, you can visualise this as submission to your past self as taskmaster. Present you thinks this blows, but past you said you had to get it done.<p>- Relentless focus.<p>Being disciplined is hard. You only have so much space in your head to keep track. You can&#x27;t be disciplined about everything. That means you have to cut stuff out. Write down the tasks you are going to do today on an index card. Do only those tasks. You&#x27;re going to get that wrong a bunch of times, so you can fix it up. Look at that card every hour, and ask yourself whether you did something on it in the last 60 minutes. Set an alarm in your phone to remind you to do it. You&#x27;re going to notice when you&#x27;re spending time on HN a lot more, trust me. It will make you feel bad, but it will make you submit to the task at hand.<p>- Pick an end.<p>&#x27;Learn C++&#x27; is not an end goal. Build a raytracer from scratch is. Don&#x27;t put a time frame on it. Don&#x27;t set about breaking it into little tasks, that will happen automatically day-to-day. That thing that motivated you at the start? Write that down. When things start to suck a bit much by going through the &#x27;this sucks&#x27; loop day in, day out, you can look at it and remember past you.<p>Then do that loop, over and over and over until you get to the end. Now you are going to get a huge reward, very different to the one you get just by starting something new when you&#x27;re motivated. In fact, you&#x27;re going to get addicted to finishing stuff and being productive because the dopamine hit is so so much sweeter.<p>That&#x27;s just what I did.",1428522207

Before the introduction of computers into the workplace, things were fundamentally different.  Productivity inched up incrementally year after year, and we dealt with that very well.  We understood it, and we structured things to function smoothly with it.  Between 1950 and 1980, average worker productivity grew by 76% and the average compensation of the lower 90% of the economy rose by 75%.<p>Then computers showed up.  Instead of worker productivity inching up slowly, it started multiplying.  Your secretary didn&#x27;t go from being able to answer 25 letters a day to 27, she went from being able to answer 25 letters a day to 150.  No one knew how to deal with this.  Keeping worker compensation in line with the value being created would require annual raises to get much larger.  Companies would need fewer workers every year to reach the same levels of productivity.  Entirely new products and services became possible all at the same time.  Companies needed thinkers, not laborers.  So many things changed so fast.  And societies and economies don&#x27;t really &#x27;do&#x27; fast.  1980 was yesterday as far as social change is concerned.  Analysts are still looking at companies and industries through lenses shaped by the Industrial Revolution - and most companies are operating in the same old ways too.<p>We haven&#x27;t adapted to the computer age yet, and it will probably be a long time before we do.  Until then, &#x27;Are we crashing or soaring?&#x27; is probably going to be a constant topic of debate.",1428522070

Apple does not see itself as producing commodity gear. They still see their gear as luxury/non-commodity AND see their cloud as a benefit/value-add and profit center.<p>The problem -for me- is that Apple simply isn&#x27;t that good at the cloud. Their competitors seem to beat them on both features and price here. You only go with iCloud for inclusion/integration with your other Apple devices, not because it is a superior cloud service.<p>They could be the &quot;anti-cloud&quot; company if they really wanted, but I think it is easier and more profitable for them to jump on the bandwagon and offer it themselves. To be an &quot;anti-cloud&quot; vendor would require them to sell against overall technology / consumer trends. They don&#x27;t need to do that when they can extend their profits offering the same, and especially if it doesn&#x27;t hurt the &quot;luxury&quot; status/profit margin of their main goods.",1428521971

If you have a chip that&#x27;s used in an ultra thin laptop, whose performance-grade suits tablets, then you can slap a derogatory &#x27;netbook&#x27; label on it.<p>And I can definitely see why you might say that. If you look at the Macbook Air 13&quot;, it&#x27;s a cheaper and more powerful device, despite being among the most portable devices, without generally a need for externals like USB hubs, or even a charger with its excellent 12h battery life. And it wasn&#x27;t considered noisy either.<p>Instead of improving that MBA: USB-C to make it slightly thinner. Full HD resolution to make it slightly sharper. Butterfly keyboard and zero-click magnetic touchpad to allow it to be thinner. Slightly smaller bezels and a slightly bigger keyboard to make it smaller. Layered battery to make it last longer, or use less space.<p>Instead of that, they said &#x27;prettiness first, let&#x27;s make it as thin as possible&#x27;, and then let&#x27;s see what performance we can squeeze in. And that performance came in behind a cheaper, older MBA, and its because uses a chip that you find in tablets.<p>Now I&#x27;m excited about the new Macbook, not the first one but future generations will likely be something quite special. And I fully understand and even appreciate why they did it. Set a new standard, a new model, for mobile consumers, in a world where even laptops are squeezed by tablets/phablets, and where most consumers don&#x27;t need the performance of a MBA (that blurred the line between consumer & pro. The MBA&#x27;s are popular lightweight development machines for example). And set the stage for increasing wireless/cloud.<p>And I also appreciate that mocking it as a mobile chip is a bit myopic. It&#x27;s actually quite fast and seems to do nicely in the early benchmarks. But yeah I see his point, it&#x27;s still a bit weird to see a performance downgrade from the &#x27;mobility line&#x27; in the Air, with a price bump and weird things like 1-port, or a 480p camera that is humbled by a the 2010 iPod Touch 720p camera. Expecting a 2nd generation of this Macbook, especially when USB-C takes off, skylake launches and the Air stops selling, to make a lot more sense than it does today.",1428521943

It&#x27;s the specifics of the shakedown that interest me.<p>The DPML is a weird beast in that each registry chooses how they will run their program individually. For example, if you pay for DPML service for a TMCH listed mark from the Donuts registry your mark cannot be registered on any of Donut&#x27;s gTLDs for the duration of your DPML block.<p>You&#x27;re also correct in that a DPML block is not the same as a domain registration. A DPML block simply prevents others from registering a domain which contains your TMCH registered mark.<p>If your trademark is not in the TMCH then you gain no special rights to either defensively register, or DPML block others from registering it, during the sunrise period. I doubt Vox Populi can limit .sucks to a specific class of registrants. This does happen, but I haven&#x27;t heard of it happening with .sucks.<p>Most recently ICANN ruled that .doctors must limit registrants to registered physicians. This pissed off a lot of people.<p>Without limiting registrants by class .sucks registry operator Vox Populi cannot charge one price to trademark holders, and another price to non-trademark holders. All they can do is offer sunrise period special rights to TMCH registrants.<p>I can think of no other TLD in the history of the Internet that has enforced price discrimination. TLDs can have class restrictions placed on registrants(.doctor, .edu, .gov), but they cannot price discriminate AFAIK. Vox Populi was able to introduce price discrimination by essentially abusing the sunrise period and the DPML procedure.<p>Have a listen to this.

Solving a five-minute problem by taking a half hour to download and install a program is a net loss. In a corporate environment, adding a program to a deployment is extraordinarily expensive. You have to work with your company&#x27;s legal team to make sure the licensing terms for the new program are acceptable and do not create undue risk from a legal standpoint. What is your plan of action if the new program stops working, and your company starts losing tens of thousands of dollars a day? You have to do interoperability testing to make sure the new program doesn&#x27;t conflict with the other programs in the deployment. (In the non-corporate case, you still run the risk that the new program will conflict with one of your existing programs.)<p>> Second, many of these &quot;solutions&quot; require that you abandon your partial solution so far and rewrite it in the new model. If you&#x27;ve invested years in tweaking a batch file and you just need one more thing to get that new feature working, and somebody says, &quot;Oh, what you need to do is throw away you batch file and start over in this new language,&quot; you&#x27;re unlikely to take up that suggestion.",1428521205

9343189,comment,9337863,9340252,0,0,otakucode,,,"Is that tendency toward idleness punctuated with productive spurts actually a weakness?  I would hold that it is actually the appropriate situation in many respects, and that our society simply hasn&#x27;t adapted to account for it yet.  One of the only physical characteristics that humans have going for them compared to other animals is their physical endurance.  We&#x27;re built for long stretches of physical work.  We are not, however, built for long stretches of intellectual work.  Economically speaking it also makes sense.  While a worker performing physical tasks establishes a level of productivity and remains mostly constant, an intellectual worker multiplies the productivity of others tremendously.  They change the nature of the work being done.  Economically, at least in a capitalist system, this is supposed to result in those intellectual workers seeing their compensation rise tremendously as well - providing them with the resources to take long breaks allowing them time for contemplation, improvement of their skills, etc.  Were it not for the illegal actions of major tech companies early in the growth of the software field, we might see compensation related to the value intellectual workers produce.  As it is, they set the standards for what such workers should be paid and divorced it completely from the value of the work being performed.<p>This has happened before, back during the Industrial Revolution.  Factories and mechanical automation enabled workers to leap in productivity over their craftsmen predecessors, and factory owners divorced their compensation from the value of the work.  Eventually, whole families had to work extremely long hours 6 or 7 days a week just to be able to afford to eat.  Society let this happen because they saw the workers as not deserving of a share of the value they were creating because &#x27;a machine was really doing the work and the owner paid for the machine&#x27;.  Things eventually reached a breaking point and society forced factory owners to pay a single person enough to raise an entire family on for 40 hours of work in a week.  This was a monumental change.  Whereas previously about 3 incomes with each working 60+ hours a week was necessary to raise a family, 1 income from 40 hours reaching the same amount was not a minor adjustment.<p>Social change takes time.  Mental workers being a large group is really quite new, and society hasn&#x27;t yet figured out how to handle them best.  They&#x27;re trying to just treat them the same as physical workers, which will inevitably fail simply because the human brain is not built for decades of constant mental work.",1428520929

Point is that German exports have been strong when the currency was strong, and they are strong with other EU countries as well as outside the EU. The USA may have helped Germany with a favourable exchange rate out of political motivation (strong ally, look commies how well OUR Germany is doing - props to the US btw.). Economically it seems like a bad deal; Wallstreet might benefit indirectly, but it&#x27;s not like the USA took ownership of German companies as reparations (that&#x27;s what the Soviets did, again, thanks Americans for being cool like that).<p>&quot;You would know that if you actually read it.&quot;<p>Key is, I knew it without reading it, as the topic is already ultra-well researched. The onus can&#x27;t be on me to read his book, in particularly coming from that author: Wouldn&#x27;t he likely be the most biased person on the planet in this matter? Objectively, giving him all the credit (heh...), wouldn&#x27;t such a book be primarily a political statement of a man under immense pressure? A tool to put some narrative to support his politics? Big words like &quot;The Global Minotaur&quot; would make it seem like it is.<p>Basically, the article discusses the global effects of &quot;global imbalances&quot;.

9343123,comment,9339064,9339064,0,0,BjoernKW,,,"Isn&#x27;t he the one who thinks printing money is a sound economic policy? Pot calling the kettle, I suppose.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t think there are absolute rights and wrongs in this game. And a game it is, the outcome of which is quite uncertain. The players (i.e. nation states and larger economic entities such as the EU) in this game sometimes act as opponents, sometimes they cooperate but unfortunately they&#x27;re hardly friends with a common goal or the greater good in mind.  Germany&#x27;s zero-debt policy might very well prove to be the right one once the next few rounds have been played.<p>Bernanke&#x27;s criticism has some merit, though. Certainly, Germany&#x27;s economic policy currently severely disadvantages other EU countries and benefits from their weakness. That definitely is a problem. However, this weakness also is largely self-imposed by corrupt politicians or generally wide-spread corruption. Greece for instance, economically shouldn&#x27;t ever have been admitted to the Euro but it was nonetheless because of political reasons. This doesn&#x27;t mean German politicians or Germans for that matter have any right to be condescending towards other nations as they sometimes come across recently. There&#x27;s corruption and tremendously wasteful spending in Germany as well. Maybe it&#x27;s just not as severe as in other countries but Germany hardly is a paragon of economic virtue itself. However, they can hardly be blamed for trying to achieve the best for their country first. Why should they draw up economic policies that benefit other countries which - without any accompanying political change on their part - would likely continue as before. Their crisis primarily isn&#x27;t caused by Germany&#x27;s strength but by their comparative weakness. On the same grounds Bernanke could advise the US the cut their grotesquely large military expenses and donate some of it to Greece so they can pay off their debt. Not bloody likely either, I suppose ...<p>That said, Germany is a tremendously wealthy country that could spend a lot more on infrastructure if it wasn&#x27;t for large amounts of taxpayers&#x27; money wasted on pointless stuff and corrupt structures. There have been talks about a proper tax reform for more than 30 years now and by and large nothing has happened. If there&#x27;s one point of criticism that can be justly made it&#x27;s that German politics is lacking a vision and is largely guided by cowardice and unwillingness to assume a leadership role. Some of its success in recent years probably was mere luck.",1428520463

Key facts:<p>- Docker is an abstraction around LXC, effectively a set of convenient scripts for controlling LXC<p>- Docker is building a platform via a package management system preloaded with their repos<p>- Platform is a threat to new entrants, e.g. CoreOS, because they risk becoming tenants<p>CoreOS realized the risk of the Docker platform, and also that Docker is unnecessary for many of its value-adds. Everything Docker can accomplish, raw linux containers can also accomplish. The problem is that scripting LXC is less convenient than using Docker, but Docker depends on LXC, therefore LXC featureset will always be ahead of Docker.<p>In the developer community, there is a growing acceptance of the fact that Docker is an abstraction over LXC. CoreOS is trying to standardize the abstraction as an implementation of the &quot;app container spec&quot; [0]. This spec puts Docker, Rocket, and lxc-tools on level playing ground.<p>Despite this apparent acceptance, the market continues to build tooling and platforms around Docker, instead of raw LXC containers. This announcement from Microsoft is just the latest example. If a new product wants to support containers, it needs to support Docker.<p>Docker is benefitting from network effects even though its product is not defensible from a technical standpoint. Docker is signing deals with competing enterprises like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, because those companies are its <i>customers</i>.<p>The risk for Docker is that these big companies eventually cut Docker out of the equation. They may eventually choose to replace Docker with their own &quot;app container runtime,&quot; with features only supported on their own platform.<p>Docker was one of the first companies to capitalize on advantages of containers, probably because they have a seriously talented group of engineers writing their code. But the market has now woken up to these advantages, and Docker is being chased by massive companies with massive resources. I hope they can fend them off and keep the upper hand in the relationship, but unfortunately I think it far more likely that Docker will eventually be cut out of the equation or acquired by one of them. This will result in a fragmentation of container technology as each company rushes to develop their own app runtime engine. Ultimately developers will suffer as platforms divide and silo, increasing developer friction and reducing cloud market competition as users consolidate around the single platform with the most momentum. Eventually, I suspect one company will control 80% of cloud computing.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/appc/spec/blob/master/SPEC.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/appc/spec/blob/master/SPEC.md</a>",1428520254

Communism refers to the set of economic systems which involve a stateless, moneyless, classless society in which the means of production are operated by workers for human need (ie: individual and collective demands).<p>Or at least, that is how the term &quot;Communism&quot; is used <i>by self-professed communists</i>, as opposed to by self-professed <i>enemies</i> of communism, who of course use the term in their propaganda to mean &quot;Soviet-style dictatorship&quot;.  But if you use any term as its enemies imply it to be defined in their propaganda, you will of course never get the bottom of the matter.<p>> (Just like how I&#x27;ve been using capitalism).<p>This is very wrong, as well.  &quot;Capitalism&quot; means the set of economic systems in which the means of production are primarily controlled by private owners (who are distinct from the state), and operated for profit (via the sale of commodities in some sort of market), by wage laborers (who survive by offering their labor in a labor market), coordinated via the exchange of currency (again, some kind of market).<p>Systems can vary from &quot;textbook&quot; capitalism in multiple directions, such as: by the state intervening to some great or small degree in the economy (social-democratic capitalism), by finance becoming the dominant economic power above and over commodities manufacturers (financialized capitalism), by raw-materials producers becoming the dominant economic power (rentier capitalism), by private rentiers merging state power into their own personal power (feudalism), by the replacement of capital-labor separation with economic democracy (socialism), by the foundational subsidization of &quot;market&quot; businesses by the state (state capitalism), by the complete nationalization of production and its turning towards the state&#x27;s national goals (fascism), by the removal of the state and its regime of private exclusive-possession &quot;property&quot; titles to resources but the keeping of the market economy (mutualism), by the removal of the state and its private-property regime and the removal of markets in favor of a debt/gift economy (anarchism), etc.<p>>From my side I am curious what you mean by economic democracy.<p>The means of production are owned and ultimate decisions are made by the people who actually do the work operating those means of production.  It means <i>exactly</i> what it sounds like: democracy in the workplace and the commons, either direct or representative.",1428520026

That is, the set of major AS operators is small enough that all the major players know one another (since ICANN) maintains a centralized list of who owns which AS number), and bogus route announcements are easy for an AS operator to detect since they coincides with floods of angry tech support calls asking why www.foo.com no longer loads (or loads www.bar.com instead).  By contrast, it seems that Stellar is geared towards environments with neither of these properties--large worlds with hard-to-notice failure modes.<p>I ask because I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on how to select quorum slices when considering the political and economic incentives that might influence which node operators I choose to trust.  Specifically, do you foresee the emergence of a small set of big-player node operators that application developers almost universally (and blindly) select for their programs&#x27; quorum sets, like how web browsers and OEMs regard CA operators today?  How can Stellar help users do better than blindly trusting a small set of operators?  I&#x27;m assuming that the fact that big-player node operators must nevertheless externalize the same slot values in order to enjoy liveliness makes it easy for the application to automatically detect any equivocation?  If so, how would nodes be deployed to resist DDoS attacks that try to break the vast majority of usres&#x27; quorum sets?  I&#x27;m getting the impression that there&#x27;s a missing precondition here that for a large-scale Stellar deployment to be successful, there must be a very diverse set of quorum sets.<p>Thanks again!",1428519925

This means you have one kernel, with multiple user spaces.
You can run a CentOS container on Ubuntu because both use a Linux Kernel. What will actually happen is that CentOS will use your already booted Ubuntu Kernel.<p>So unless Windows switches to a Linux Kernel or vice versa you will <i>never</i> be able to run one as a container on the other.<p>You <i>can</i> however do that with Virtual Machines. But installing a stripped down version of windows in a virtual machine does not make it a container, it makes it marketing bullshit.<p>&quot;Containers on baremetal&quot; and containerizing dot net are thus a bit silly concepts since .NET has nothing to do with the operating system and you can&#x27;t run a container on &quot;bare metal&quot; whatever you might mean by that.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtuali...</a>",1428519657

Is control over where and when your data is available, and by which means it is shared with the world, not important?  Maybe this is more of a European thing, but the backlash against cloud computing is very much still in full force - there are people actually <i>not buying computers</i> because all this Cloud nonsense is being shoved down our throats - are these not &#x27;the rest of us&#x27;?<p>I didn&#x27;t realize, though, that you don&#x27;t need a Mac to run Photo for OSX.  That&#x27;s a curious development - what I guess you mean is, all you need to buy (from Apple) is an iDevice, and they&#x27;ll then own everything you do with it from that point onwards .. to the extent that they&#x27;ll make it easy for you to gain access to your media/content.  (Psst.. as long as you keep paying the subscription.)<p>Oh, and btw, I already pay a subscription for access to the Internet.  Why can&#x27;t I just use this to share my data, instead of needing an <i>additional</i> Cloud-fee to do the same task?  I think people need to remove their blinkers here - we&#x27;re being shafted with this Cloud culture blaring its horns.<p>I have a Mac.  I want to share my media/content with the world.  The Mac is perfectly capable of doing that - and I trust it more than any other computer in the world, because its sitting there, on my desk, in my house, under my lock and key, with my network equipment, passwords for which I control.  I don&#x27;t think this Cloud business has anywhere near that level of quality of service, and if only the OS vendors were aware of the demand for this sort of thing, they&#x27;d be building in peer-to-peer NAT traversal tools, sticking a nice GUI on top, and calling themselves real Operating System vendors again.

It&#x27;s unlikely for them to be able to effectively gauge the quality of an employer, they have little leverage to bargain for equity, and it&#x27;s highly unusual that these companies provide an environment for young engineers to rapidly grow.<p>The first few years of an engineers career should be seen as apprenticeship. The best way to quickly grow is to go work for a well-regarded, established company that will compensate them well and provide an environment for them to learn and grow rapidly. Engineers right out of school make $200k/yr working for the likes of Google or Facebook. After a few years of that, they can go try to start a company or negotiate a decent amount of equity at an early-stage startup that they believe in, and they&#x27;ll have had the opportunity to actually save some money to exercise those options when the time comes.<p>Of course, this advice doesn&#x27;t apply to unicorns which, by definition, most people are not.",1428519616

My story is not unique.<p>The story goes that things that do not kill you make you stronger. So one might theorize that this is one more obstacle that will separate the men from the boys. It is just a test of your relentless resourcefulness. But its only a theory. I feel that immigration rules in the US are one of those things that kill the boys and leave behind dead men.<p>Agreed, I set sail on a boat, a flying one, on a calculation that I have better chances over here than where I started from. So I stand and fight for a 5% chance over a 2% one. But its a depressing fight. So if you are listening to this and in one of the other countries that wants your own silicon valley this is the silver bullet. Make immigration laws strictly adhere to common sense without exception.<p>In the meantime let me go back and drive the American Innovation and be pissed on by politicians trying to get some votes.",1246820386

Let me tell you what my experiences have been...<p>If smaller IT staffs can benefit from Windows features, then IT staffs can be almost eliminated by Unix features.  On my campus over a <i>decade</i> ago, it took <i>one man</i> to administer the <i>entire network</i> of Unix machines.<p>""The company"" doesn't tend to make the decision so much as ""the I.T. group"", which is trusted by executives that really don't know any better.  Since I.T. won't risk its livelihood on relative unknowns, nothing significant ever really changes.  Why would they deploy something that takes one man to run, when they can have Windows?<p>In most organizations, there are plenty of users who don't know any better.  And there are users who hate Windows, but they've long given up the fight because if they complained all day long, they'd never get any real work done.  And for this same reason, they're not about to look for another job: Windows is too prevalent.<p>Sometimes, employees are extremely productive.  These are the ones knowledgeable and efficient enough to deploy their own solutions in spite of I.T. offerings.  They're the ones loading up Windows with a pile of open-source packages to make up for its pitiful tool set.  Or, networking together a bunch of Linux laptops because they know nothing else will do the job.  Despite the fact that their company has failed them with a poor status quo, these employees are more committed than anyone to do really good work.<p>But even those people have limits; they eventually leave and form startups (that are free of Windows).  Having failed its true talent, the company is left with the people who don't know or don't care how to be productive anymore.  Mission accomplished?",1246819724

But the fact remains that it does, and they're something that a lot of people have trouble with, and have a lot less trouble when they're on speed. While we're working to reform the education system, we shouldn't deny people the chemicals they need to cope with the system as it is.<p>When it comes to taking tests, 99% of the population seems to me like they have serious brain problems. They perform far below my level, which I arbitrarily designate as normal. The kinds of ""real brain problems that need some intervention"" that we're talking about here are defined pretty empirically; we mostly aren't talking about things that show up on an MRI, we're talking about things that are ""diagnosed"" by people scoring 1½σ below the mean on an IQ test.<p>To take a concrete and fairly extreme example, I don't know what the fuck is wrong with people that they can see a word spelled correctly dozens or hundreds of times and still not know how to spell it. But that seems to be the case for 99% of the population.<p>The function of correct spelling in modern society seems to me to be essentially the same as the function of good penmanship a century ago: to demonstrate to the reader that the writer is properly educated, i.e. approximately that their parents were rich enough that they didn't have to pull them out of school in 1950 when they were 10 to work on the farm. Fundamentally, this is harmful to the social fabric. Either prejudice distracts from the quality of the writing — there are any number of Nobel-winning writers with terrible spelling and penmanship.<p>(I was expelled from eighth grade for picking a particularly inopportune time to explain this point of view, somewhat less articulately: coming in second in the regional spelling bee, if I remember correctly.)<p>It's fortunate that this particular neurological deficit doesn't happen to cause any harm, and unfortunate that we choose to stigmatize the 99% of the population who's dramatically worse at it than I am. But given that there's a relatively safe drug that allows many people to escape that stigma, it seems reasonable to let them have it until such time as we can expiate the stigma.",1246818155

For one of these Ideas to become known to us, a human's brain must at some point ""think"" it - by entering some physical/biological state (firing pattern?) which encodes that idea.<p>Then the human search for these Ideas is really a search over an enormous state space of all possible brain states.  Some factors that can affect one's odds of being first to exhibit an Idea:<p>- Wiring: some brains are born prone to Idea states.  Through plasticity, brains can increase their propensity to represent Idea states.  Also, some brains are wired to acquire new states and evaluate them more quickly.<p>- Hard work: entering & evaluating more states than other people, usually in a small area, through disciplined investigation.<p>- Inputs: the right knowledge at the right moment (Ideas are similar to each other - cf. beauty as a correctness heuristic)<p>- Blind luck<p>Some apparent characteristics of Idea states:<p>- It is hard work to represent an Idea state (presumably, the easy ones are those we are born to, and appear trivial to us)<p>- Idea states appear to occur in clusters (cf. beauty as a truth heuristic in physical theories)<p>- It is difficult to define a distance metric between Idea states<p>- Corollary: it is difficult to tell how far away any given state is from the nearest Idea state<p>As far as I can tell, the author of this article is arguing that it is unreasonable to stop searching simply because one's brain is not as Idea-compatible as F-E-H's appear to be.

If so, you should know that there are very strict laws on who can work in US military (and government) positions. Very often, you must be a US citizen to gain even lower level employment in sensitive military contracts. I know for a fact that not only do you have to have to be a natural American citizen (born in the United States), but you also have to have lived abroad only temporarily for a certain amount of time and lived consecutively in the US (for 10 years, I think?) to be eligible to earn the highest security clearances. Government work will probably remain the domain of US citizens, as very often its viewed as a national security risk otherwise.",1246817221

Most of the time, the costs are just non-obvious to engineering.<p>Here are some rough numbers.<p>Power for a single 48U rack usually runs $200-$300/month for two 20amp circuits (possibly +2 for redundancy). A modern 1U server draws anywhere from (roughly) 1.66 to 2.5 amps, and you can only use 80% of a circuit's maximum supported load due to safety regulations, resulting in a total supported count of between 12 to 19 mid-range servers per rack. Higher-end servers have a significantly increased power draw, but potentially higher efficiency, and there can be a significant advantage to leveraging multi-core systems.<p>In addition to rackspace and power, each server must obviously be connected to the network. The switches draw enough power to potentially decrease the number of supported servers.<p>Each rack costs roughly $500/month (plus power), and often requires advanced provisioning to ensure that rackspace is available, and if possible, located in the same area. It's not unusual to buy an entire block of space well ahead of actual use to ensure that the business' growth can be accommodated.<p>Additionally, one requires an operations staff to maintain the servers. Hard drives fail, backups must be done, hardware must be ordered, tested, and finally, deployed. Simple deployment of a single server, including the networking configuration, travel time, and physical work can easily consume 4-8 hours of operations staff time.<p>When you add together the operational and capital expenditures, I'm not really convinced that the idea is so simple as ""servers are cheap, programmers are expensive"". Servers, electricity, physical space, and the labor necessary to install and maintain them are not particularly cheap.<p>I'd propose a new mantra: programmers are expensive, and so are servers and IT, and so let's try to not be monomaniacally flippant about it. Software can be easy to write AND perform reasonably well, and to say otherwise simply appears to be a false dichotomy fronted by those who benefit from it most.",1246817156

688506,comment,688178,688463,0,0,jerf,,,"""But if you have nearly unlimited resources, why worry about misallocating a small fraction of them?""<p>Because there is no society so rich that it can't misallocate even worse. Yes, I include full post-Singularity societies in that statement.<p>I think rather than saying ""socialism can work then"" or even ""X can work then"" for X in (socialism, anarchy, capitalism, etc.), it is rather worth saying that in that case, the foundation will have changed so radically that it is, correspondingly, time to completely reconsider society's economics from scratch.<p>The laws of economics will still be in play, and for a <i>very</i> long time there will still be the challenge of deciding <i>which</i> projects we wish to engage in, large and small (""which star do we colonize?""). That is not the problem that goes away. The problem that goes away is the lack of resources for basic happiness for some entity, a world we still live in.<p><i>Edit</i>: Actually, for proof I point to modern society. We are <i>already</i>, not to put too fine a point on it, ""fucking rich"". We have massively more resources than we did even twenty years ago. Yet many of us feel poorer today, because an awful lot of that excess is getting tied up in various things that I will put under the umbrella of ""economically unproductive"". For instance, in the context of recent state government funding troubles, many people have observed that almost across the board state governments are spending radically more than they did in 2003, yet it hardly seems like they're performing that many more <i>services</i> than they did in 2003. A lot of that is because we are being terribly economically inefficient.<p>Health care has some of the same problems. We have radically more resources than we used to, but thanks to some systematic failures in the system (pick your choice of excessive centralization or insufficient centralization, for this point I don't care), we are spending way more than we need to. This is proved by people's ability to fly to, say, Argentina, and get virtually identical surgeries (even in a clean and safe environment) for one-tenth the price, give or take a bit. (The exact ratio doesn't matter, what matters is that it is <i>large</i>.)<p>We should be either getting massively more from our government, or paying massively less, than we did ten years ago, but we aren't. Health care expenditures may still be going up (it is a potential economic sinkhole just by its nature), but it still should be costing less <i>per procedure</i> than it did ten years ago, but it doesn't. (On average. There are exceptions where medicine has advanced so far that it is cheaper for some procedures.)<p>Unfortunately, it's just not possible to ""wealth"" your way out of needing to put at least <i>some</i> thought into economic efficiency.<p>(Also, I <i>personally</i> do not feel poorer and believe that we are still better off than twenty years ago. I am merely observing that A: I appear to be in a minority there, at least among people motivated to post in online discussions and B: we should be even <i>better</i> off than we actually are.)",1246816987

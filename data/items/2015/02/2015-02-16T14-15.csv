But for instance I run wrote my own Stripe-based invoice generation, subscription management, and dunning vs paying for a service. It works for me for now. If one day my little app breaks down if/when I have thousands of customers then I&#x27;ll outsource it.<p>I run my own private Git repo vs paying $7 to github.

9057120,comment,9055869,9056816,0,0,innguest,,,"> I&#x27;m not sure why free speech IS file sharing in your argument. Maybe freedom of intellectual property?<p>The reason you&#x27;re not sure file sharing is free speech is because your thinking is still clouded by the notion that there is such a thing as &quot;intellectual property&quot;.<p>Property, that pesky word with a relentlessly concrete meaning, is something in the material world that can be bought, sold, stolen, given, auctioned, and after any or all of those actions, it still exists in the same quantity it existed before. Examples: land, cars, computers.<p>When a person P steals property from another person Q, then it must be true P now is in possession of the property, and Q is not in possession of the property anymore.<p>When you say a sentence out loud, I can remember it and say it again to someone else. That does not mean I stole that sentence from you (it may mean I&#x27;m unoriginal), because you still have the ability to say it.<p>Now say you say a sentence so long I want to write it down so I can say it again. I write it down and save it on a file on my computer. I give this file to my friends - that is, I give <i>copies</i> of this file to my friends. Now we all have a file that represents that long sentence you uttered, and yet not my friends nor I have taken that sentence away from you.<p>A file is a long sentence written down. It is speech. It is not property like cars, land and computers. I hope this helps.",1424098624

* With my glasses prescription, the screen is difficult to read (chromatic abberation).  A co-worker with the same model laptop experiences the same problem, and my manager also dislikes the screen on her T530.
* Unlike ASUS and MSI laptops, there&#x27;s no default keyboard option to disable the trackpad.

And the rotation is 2.5 months on patrol (figure maybe 2 months effective?) and 1 month in port.  I imagine a giant crane lowering supplies into the sub might block launched missiles... I don&#x27;t think they have the compressed air online to launch while in port, although maybe...  So more realistically, assuming no long term refits the navy has maybe 7 or so in position ready to launch.  So WRT the infographic, maybe 168 ready to launch.<p>However.  Everything from here on is classified so I&#x27;m speculating.  There are tactical conditions where trying to launch will merely get yourself sunk before launching.  So you&#x27;ve got a ASW destroyer and helos overhead pounding the sea with active sonar because we&#x27;re having a nuclear war here.  Speaking of nuclear war, during a nuclear war being on board a deployed SSBN is probably somewhat hazardous duty, so &quot;we&quot; probably don&#x27;t have 14 floating SSBNs for very long.  Also peculiar range issues and launch geometry issues, if theoretically we&#x27;re at war with China, a launch trajectory passing directly over Moscow is going to totally freak out the Russians at the worst imaginable time.  Also from a strategic standpoint using up your entire force in one attack is really dumb.  Also there are weather related issues, if you&#x27;re in high seas you might have launch issues.  Sure you can pop a missile out the tube but if it starts its launch in the air sideways thats a mission failure.  So I think in actual warfare maybe only 2 subs get to launch, at best.  Suddenly we&#x27;re down to 48 missiles in the air from the 288 infographic.  Best case.  Good argument for one.  Or 24 missiles.<p>Again more classified BS.  The best NASA and the russians can do under ideal conditions is launch maybe half of the time on time without a failure.  Of course they put a lot of money into being reliable, but...  I feel 50% successful launches might be semi-realistic?  I mean, every attack sub and ASW helicopter is going to be all over you the instant the first missile launches, the odds of surviving until the 24th missile launches seem low, which is why we don&#x27;t deploy subs will 500 tubes because tubes 200-500 will never survive to fire...  If some 50 cent integrated circuit fails or some valve, its non trivial to fix the missile while underway and you might not have the spare parts.  I stand by about 50% estimate.<p>The MIRV thing means at re-entry you can attack nearby targets, so the equivalent of Saint Paul and Minneapolis are both in big trouble, but for trajectory and aerospace reasons its hard to hit Seattle and DC at the same time.  So you can pack multiple warheads on a missile, but you really only get maybe 30 targets outta 24 missiles.  Why do you think we spread our missile launch fields all over the upper midwest instead of putting them all in one county in Texas?<p>Finally we know from semi-public test results that not every test goes perfectly, so I have a gut feeling that in a real nuclear war no holds barred, high radiation environment, 25 or so hits is reasonable.  Hopefully thats enough to discourage any belligerent from starting a war they&#x27;d lose.<p>You can see the motivation to not decrease stocks by 10x or 100x because that takes the odds of 25 hits down to 2.5 hits or 0.25 hits.  Decrease the number of nukes by 100x and we&#x27;ll kill dozens of millions within one generation in WW3, guaranteed, not much changes in human nature.

The explosion in connectivity options and the associated increase in traffic far outstrips that capacity of any intelligence agency in the world to accurately monitor and process.<p>The result of that is that the real data falls right through the cracks when at the same time innocents the world over have their &#x27;profiles&#x27; built up in ridiculous detail (maybe on the off chance that they will commit some future crime).<p>It&#x27;s security theatre, just like what you get when you go about your daily business at an airport, lots of hassle for extremely little - if any - gain. Some believe even the smallest amount of gain is worth an incredible amount of discomfort and should require giving up any semblance of privacy.<p>But it&#x27;s a ridiculous stance, in the end the terrorists (or whatever the bogeyman is called this year) will simply up their game to disappear even further into the background noise.<p>A terrorist is a person with a problem of the mind, education and spreading the worlds wealth more evenly will do more to combat it than any amount of legislation to forbid encryption and dragnet surveillance will ever achieve.<p>If terrorists really wanted to blow up commercial airliners they could do so with impunity, I can think of several ways in which they could achieve this and <i>none</i> of those would require communication via the internet or the telephone.<p>So my conclusion is that the terrorists aren&#x27;t really the target here.",1424095727

The only one listed there as an RFC using &#x27;.&#x27; is RFC 4686, (in the padding column right now it says &quot;= (optional, not recommended. Recommended use .)&quot;). That&#x27;s wrong though. In RFC 4648 it actually says:<p><i>The remaining unreserved URI character is &quot;.&quot;, but some file system environments do not permit multiple &quot;.&quot; in a filename, thus making the &quot;.&quot; character unattractive as well.</i><p>And...<p><i>The pad character &quot;=&quot; is typically percent-encoded when used in an URI, but if the data length is known implicitly, this can be avoided by skipping the padding</i><p>The data length is known for a cryptographic hash, so you would omit the &#x27;=&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;ll fix wikipedia.",1424095693

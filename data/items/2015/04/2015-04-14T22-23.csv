9377863,comment,9372807,9376779,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> No BI scenario: Company pays 50 groats a year to a worker to create TPS reports based on its sense of the value of having those reports completed.<p>[...]<p>> BI scenario: State pays everyone 10 groats a year. Company now pays 40 groats to its TPS writers<p>How does that conclusion work?<p>We&#x27;ve already established that in the absence of the BI, the intersection of the supply and demand curves for companies to hire people to write TPS reports is at 50 groats a year. Howe does giving everyone 10 groats per year of income independent of groat writing decrease the market clearing cost of groat writing? Considering the supply (labor) supply alone, it shouldn&#x27;t decrease the marginal <i>utility</i> cost of groat writing, but given that, like most things, income has a declining marginal utility, the baseline income should increase the financial equivalent to that cost, and thus shift the demand curve in a way that would increase the market clearing cost. Where&#x27;s the countervailing supply side effect that more than makes up for this? I suppose its possible depending on tax rates and how they are distributed that the marginal value to the company of TPS reports could be decreased, resulting in a shift in the demand curve that has the effect of reducing the market clearing price, but that&#x27;s not obviously correct.<p>In any case, at the same time, work that has a marginal value to the employer less than the pre-BI minimum wage becomes a viable form of employment with BI if the minimum wage is removed. (The BI provides the minimum condition guarantee, removing the need for a minimum wage to provide an assurance that at least those employed have a minimum condition guarantee.)",1429052069

While I hope they recover and do great, they also suddenly have freelance &quot;journalists&quot; writing positive things about them in the press, and I&#x27;m 99% sure it&#x27;s paid PR via VC connections (especially given that I know for a fact the publication - TheStreet.com - has ties to the NYC VC community). Meanwhile, because it&#x27;s not a super well known company, there&#x27;s not a lot of opinions out there one way or the other on it so when you Google its name you just read these few very positive pieces about it. Now, this may be just paranoia, but we as an industry should be vigilant that VCs don&#x27;t try to run pump-and-dumps on their weaker holdings. It will benefit nobody but bad VCs and will harm the public and the industry&#x27;s reputation, and due to lockups it&#x27;s unlikely it will benefit the typical employee with common shares anyway.<p>I read an article about these mini-IPOs in the WSJ and it&#x27;s saying &quot;Democrats like it because it empowers the little guy, Republicans like it because it removes regulation.&quot; They also tried to spin it as &quot;VCs HATE this! Average investors can take over instead now!&quot; I don&#x27;t trust Wall Street and I don&#x27;t trust the SEC&#x27;s ability to regulate them, so when the rules change I assume that Wall St is getting their way rather than the reverse.

Those products are pretty cool, and there are thousands of them that you&#x27;ve never heard of.

A cool product without a marketing story that excites people, will be lost in a vast sea of other products.<p>As people are exposed to more and more products, they&#x27;re harder and harder to impress.

It is fun to see your stuff in stores and hear people&#x27;s delight when they are interacting with something you have created.  Perhaps it doesn&#x27;t matter that what delights them today will bore them tomorrow.  You delighted them today.<p>So, to answer your question, build things that delight people.  Make it magical.

I&#x27;ve followed Google&#x27;s numbers pretty closely since I left in 2010 to track trends from the outside that had started becoming apparent on the inside. Basically there is a limit on how &quot;good&quot; you can be at search advertising, and other companies are relentlessly investing there and so as Microsoft, for example, has quarters of growing ad value both in CPC and volume. Google has declining CPC and growing paid distribution costs. It is often hard to hold a technological edge without moving the bar forward, and while Google was way out ahead before, now they get fewer and fewer gains with the investments they do. That squeezes margins and that results in focus (good) and conservative management (not so good).<p>What is really spot on in the article is that when the &#x27;luster&#x27; of being a growth company comes off, the stock feels it disproportionately. And as RSUs are the retention package of choice your &quot;retention bonus&quot; gets smaller as the stock takes a hit. That unlocks hand cuffs and people who are smart and aggressive opt to try something with more risk and a better potential reward.<p>It really is true that nothing is forever, but I know there is always the tendency to operate as if it is.

Design is how you think about and solve a problem.<p>I go back to Dieter Rams&#x27; 10 Principles of Good Design often. [0] I&#x27;ve highlighted a few key ones here:<p>Good Design Makes a Product Useful : A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product while disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.<p>Good Design Makes A Product Understandable : It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product clearly express its function by making use of the user’s intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory.<p>The post mentions this: &#x27;For those of us who believe in the power of design thinking to solve human problems, and to a lesser extent in the power of markets to reward solutions when the interests of consumers and businesses are correctly aligned, this was invigorating news. &quot;<p>What problems are Carousel, Paper, or Jelly solving? He mentions theses question but I think he conflates pretty UI with good design when choosing these products as examples. Maybe that&#x27;s a failure of the community who heralded these three as &quot;design led apps&quot;... but for me, these are not &quot;well designed apps&quot;, they&#x27;re pretty apps. How about Inbox, Dropbox (prime?), Periscope, Slack, IFTTT, the plethora of calendar replacements like Fantastical or Sunrise? There are so many apps that are functional as well as beautiful, why choose three objective failures?<p>I think design is just as important today as it has been for the past few years. We just need to be more sensitive to what counts as good design and not be distracted by rounded rectangles, lightboxes, and animations.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.archdaily.com/198583/dieter-rams-10-principles-of-%E2%80%9Cgood-design%E2%80%9D/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archdaily.com/198583/dieter-rams-10-principles-of...</a>",1429050678

Literally every open-source project that Oracle owns has stagnated at best (aside from <i>maybe</i> Java; while I&#x27;m personally unimpressed by Java 8, I know there are a few people who would disagree with me), and at worse has significantly deteriorated, died entirely, been shoved off onto some other organization, or resulted in a fork, and sometimes <i>all of the above</i> has happened (see also: OpenOffice).<p>Like, I&#x27;m a pretty well-natured person in general and am happy to give even some of the most despicable companies the benefit of the doubt on occasion, but I seriously can&#x27;t find a single reason to do so for Oracle.

9377691,comment,9376573,9377613,0,0,cheald,,,"TokuMX was really &quot;MongoDB done right&quot;, at least up until MongoDB&#x27;s integration of the WiredTiger engine. They also did some stuff with things like election protocols and stuff to improve on vanilla MongoDB, as well. It was really quite nice to work with. I&#x27;ve been a vocal advocate for it over the last couple of years.<p>All that said, I am rather concerned about a lack of ongoing support for it, though. TokuMX 2.0.0 was released 7 months ago, with the promise of MongoDB 2.6 support &quot;shortly&quot; (MongoDB 2.6 was released just over a year ago). That&#x27;s yet to materialize, and I&#x27;ve reported a number of bugs which haven&#x27;t received prompt fixes (inlcuding a segfault which was closed as &quot;working as intended&quot;). These are edge cases, and certainly not the norm, but I was really impressed with Tokutek&#x27;s support of the product a couple of years ago, and it sadly feels like it&#x27;s dwindled to life support.<p>Unless Percona makes a strong showing with it shortly, I&#x27;m not going to be able to justify building on it any longer.",1429049303

There is no court to approve a restructuring plan that will wipe out some debts and convert others to equity, as there is for companies.</i><p>The court essentially said that making policy isn&#x27;t their job - only enforcing the law is.<p>I find it quite odd that the article and many of the parties involved almost seem to assume that the court should be making law from the bench.

You have to test it on half the inputs, plus one.<p>With the added power of a quantum computer, we can solve it with only one call to f.<p>Boom, there is exponential speedup with quantum computing.

7919645,comment,7917976,7919155,1,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> I think it&#x27;s up to the founders and early employees to set the culture they want. It will usually change as the company grows, but my general feeling is that if you don&#x27;t like a company&#x27;s culture, don&#x27;t join it.<p>Your &quot;it will usually change as the company grows&quot; observation is worth discussing further.<p>The reality is that &quot;culture&quot; as a lot of people in the Valley think of it simply doesn&#x27;t scale. The environment you have at 10 employees is going to be different than the environment you had at 5 employees, the environment you have at 75 employees is going to be different than the environment you had at 25 employees, and so on and so forth. No matter how hard you try, the &quot;culture&quot; is going to change.<p>Now, I won&#x27;t argue that at the earliest stages of a company, how well folks get along is important. But a lot of founders over-optimize the wrong things (such as extracurricular activities) under the guise of &quot;culture&quot; and &quot;culture fit&quot; because they naively believe that folks can&#x27;t get along and do great work if they don&#x27;t have an environment that <i>forces</i> employees to form social bonds that resemble the type of social bonds that exist between friends and family.<p>It&#x27;s sad that more founders don&#x27;t understand the concept of corporate values. Instead of trying to hire folks who look the same and want essentially the same experience from their job, it is possible to build a strong, diverse organizations united by shared values.",1403242965

This means isolation (qubits far apart) or encoding the information in systems that interact weakly with each other.<p>However, to have good quantum computation (quick), you want strongly interacting qubits.<p>The two goals are diametrically opposite, so it&#x27;s not clear how we can achieve both of them in a single system.<p>IMHO, the first interesting things that will come from quantum information science will be about quantum simulations of physical systems and quantum communication.

Even if I never made a dime from it and just broke even, it would be worth it to me. And I say change the world, and I guess I mean it, but a small subset of the world. Perhaps 10% of the population of developed countries could gain benefit from my service. It&#x27;s probably not even that good of an idea, however I have gotten quite a bit of support from communities of people with mood disorders that I&#x27;ve posted about it on.<p>The idea by the way, I&#x27;ll write a more detailed explanation about it when I&#x27;m on my computer, is basically a mood tracker that your therapist/psychiatrist, and potentially friends and family, has access to if you as the user grant them that access. They can view your check-ins and mood graphs at any time from a professional/support account. It also automatically notifies your supports, mainly your mental health professional(s), but also family and friends if you&#x27;re linked to them through a support account, through text and email if you mark yourself as having suicidal feelings, or feelings of harming somebody else.<p>Having dealt with depression I know for a fact that actively seeking help was not a concern of mine at my lowest points. However, something as passive as marking my mood as suicidal on an app or website, that&#x27;s something I could do. And it would in turn have the same effect as if I texted my therapist about my feelings. Along with those features there&#x27;s a bit more to it that separates it from other mood trackers but I&#x27;ll only explain those if you&#x27;re interested in hearing more.<p>So it&#x27;s probably not the world changing idea I made it out to be, but I think it could help in the treatment of those facing mood disorders, by allowing their psychiatrist or therapist as well as family and friends to play an active role in monitoring their mood and helping at the lows or highs (for those with bipolar). Maybe it&#x27;ll never catch on, but even if it got a few hundred users whose well-being was benefited by it, then it&#x27;s worth it.

7919595,comment,7919183,7919512,2,0,TheZenPsycho,,,"There are gaps in my knowledge, but my understanding is that to address 32-bits of memory requires the use of a &quot;DOS extender&quot;. The reason being that DOS is barely an operating system at all- It never provided any 32-bit support but support was possible by monkey patching over part of the operating system in memory. This was possible because DOS had no security measures preventing such horrifying endeavours.<p>Anyway, I see no reference to a dos extender here so I don&#x27;t know how it could be anything other than a 16-bit program.<p>If the author of this framework is looking for a dos extender, I think HX seems like a good choice: <a href=""http://www.japheth.de/HX.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.japheth.de/HX.html</a><p>unlike other DOS extenders, that provide idiosyncratic apis for allocating 32-bit memory, HX imitates as much as possible standard windows apis, and is able to run some windows applications in plain DOS- including, strangely enough, DOSBox.<p>(I have nothing to do with HX by the way.)",1403241038

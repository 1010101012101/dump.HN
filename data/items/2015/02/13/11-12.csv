Starts off leading towards some great conclusion that any amount of alcohol is bad for you, then tails off with this:<p>&quot;The team found there&#x27;s at best a small decline in mortality rates for men aged 50 to 64 and women aged 65 and older. Former drinkers, meanwhile, had somewhat higher mortality rates than others, suggesting that past claims light drinking was good for your heart were based on faulty comparisons. After all, some of those who&#x27;d quit were probably heavy drinkers in the past, and, compared to them, light drinkers had likely done less damage to their hearts.&quot;<p>In summary, it appears to be saying that there&#x27;s a small benefit in light to moderate alcohol consumption but heavy drinking is probably bad ... uh no shit, that&#x27;s what people have been saying for years?",1423828699

Given that you understand both the browser and the way DisplayObjects implement bitmap caching in Flash, I was wondering if you got any clues on how to optimize DOM heavy pages? There are quite a few situations where momentarilly swapping out complex static DOM with a bitmap representation would decrease drawing calls. What I don&#x27;t know is, to what extent are browsers smart about caching the renders, and when the overhead of caching by canvas would be smaller than default DOM rendering. However, I&#x27;ve had plenty of success in increasing performance, for instance, using canvas to resample images from original to DOM element size, so I&#x27;m optimistic about bitmap caching as well.<p>I&#x27;m on a friends tablet now, but I&#x27;m looking forward to digging through the implementation later.

As such you could perhaps apply them in classifying birdsong, gunshots, or whatever else (with varying success, of course..).<p>I have no doubt that these methods and their acronyms will become irrelevant (perhaps they already are), but I guess some of the basic underlying ideas about variability will re-emerge in the training regime of DNNs.

Most smart home features are &#x27;nice to have&#x27;, not worth a lot of messing around and cash.<p>My girlfriend used to occasionally watch a show about house-buying (House Hunters). In general the show wasn&#x27;t terribly interesting, but the real estate agents featured sometimes had some interesting tips.<p>One of those tips was to carefully consider not just <i>how</i> you will use a feature of a house (like a pool, or guest bedroom), but <i>how often</i> you will use it. Apparently people spring for expensive extras like pools and outdoor living spaces because they imagine how great it will be to have family and friends over for picnics, etc. But then they do it once, and never again because it is a huge inconvenience. Same goes for &quot;mother-in-law suites&quot; and spare bedrooms. People tell themselves it will be wonderful to have family stay with them, but the family members only visit once a year (if that), so a hotel is actually more economical (or just have someone sleep on the couch).<p>I tend to think of &quot;smart house&quot; features in this way. Every once in awhile I would appreciate having my living space adapt to my needs or respond to remote commands, but 99.99% of the time, it just doesn&#x27;t matter. The light switch is right next to the door, I can stand up to close the shades, and thermostats have been programmable for decades now.<p>Eventually we&#x27;ll probably come up with something that works even better (just like the programmable thermostats were a strict improvement upon their predecessors). But things like converting the light switch to an &quot;app&quot; or controlling the AC with a rudimentary geo-fence aren&#x27;t it.",1423826511

Dropping to 66% accuracy means that one word in three is wrong - it&#x27;s almost impossible to make sense of something that badly degraded.<p>Here&#x27;s a nice example, here are the &#x27;Automatic Captions&#x27; - provided by YouTube&#x27;s voice recognition technology - of an MIT YouTube video. This is a &#x27;best of all possible worlds&#x27; example - there is a single speaker, whose words are pronounced slowly and clearly, with no background noise or undue slurring or interference.

It seems righteously unfair for NAD to pick on an uncaptioned video and then point out isolated errors in YouTube&#x27;s (not MIT&#x27;s) transcriptions of same, a point which I hope is made in MIT&#x27;s defence.<p>There are 263 videos on MIT&#x27;s YouTube channel, of which 91 are captioned. Most of the videos are only a few minutes long, so getting that channel 100% captioned would take maybe a day or two, if that - I&#x27;m almost tempted to donate a weekend of my time to it (assuming that MIT would even take the finished results, which is of course by no means certain.)<p>Obviously that&#x27;s just YouTube - the wider selection of courses is another matter.

First off its not going to go bad like a bulb which will be replaced eventually; even LEDs which still die too soon. Really, who came up with this light bulb idea...its just daft.<p>Security motion detectors can be used to double effect here as well, you would naturally have them facing doors so they could activate wireless or through signals across existing wires.

9043757,comment,9043524,9043524,0,0,gambiting,,,"I have a similar problem with Chromecast and Youtube. My friends literally cannot understand why I would rather use the YouTube client built into the TV and control it with the TV remote, rather than cast to chromecast and control with my phone. Controlling the TV with my phone is cumbersome. It takes time to unlock it,to find the app, to send the command and have chromecast react. What if someone rings and I want to pause the video before answering the call? Doable,but more complex than it needs to be. What if I leave the room but someone else wants to pause, skip or whatever, but their phone is not connected to my chromecast? In comparison, TV remote is always in front of my TV. Using it is dead simple,doesn&#x27;t require pairing,and it&#x27;s instantaneous. It doesn&#x27;t leave the room when I go to the kitchen, and I can use it while I am on my phone. I feel like controlling lights with your phone is a similar gimmick. It doesn&#x27;t make it easier or faster - it&#x27;s just gimmicky, that&#x27;s all.",1423825465

8946736,comment,8945071,8946019,0,0,theorique,,,"There&#x27;s a lot of heterogeneity in what people consider sacred nowadays, and probably less illusion of a shared consensus. For example, the &quot;shocking&quot; comics in Charlie Hebdo are genuinely religiously offensive in the Moslem world, intellectually offensive to some liberals in the West who think that the comics are rude to a religious minority, and not offensive to a great many secular or otherwise non-Moslem people.<p>Similarly, art in the West that would have shocked as recently as the 1950s is now greeted with an eye roll and &quot;this again? Probably just a stunt.&quot;<p>Furthermore, the chance to take offense and be a moral scold seems to have become equal opportunity - as concepts like feminism and multiculturalism gained influence over the past few decades, being offensive to left-wing taboos is increasingly &quot;shocking&quot;. Whereas previously, a person might be tried for &quot;obscenity&quot; (against morality or Christianity or public order), now he might be tried for &quot;human rights offenses&quot; or &quot;cultural insensitivity&quot;.",1422277173

8946734,comment,8946399,8946399,0,0,throwmeunder,,,"First having your naked pictures out in the internet against your consent is an awful thing that shouldn&#x27;t happen to anyone. Having your information out in the public eye and emails like the ones she received is terrifying and the more severe problem here.<p>That being sad I disagree with the whole subtext of the story: \nthat these people get off on the idea of a non consenting victim.<p>quotes from <a href=""http://www.hystericalfeminisms.com/consent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hystericalfeminisms.com/consent/</a>:\n&quot;It’s one thing to be sexualised by people who are attracted to you, but it’s quite another thing when the lack of a ‘you’, when dehumanization, is the main factor.&quot;<p>&quot;Take ‘creepshots’, a global phenomenon which entails photographing women without their knowledge or consent, in order to share them in a sexual context online. On similar sites, people link to Facebook pages asking if anyone can hack or find more pictures of the girl. Here, again, women are used as objects whose lack of consent, of participation, provides the reason and allure of their sexualisation.&quot;<p>&quot;This dynamic is a commonplace online and is a concrete manifestation of a larger discourse around the female body, the notion that it is erotic to sexualise someone who is unaware. We all know the tropes: the sexy teacher/student/nurse/waiter/bartender/doctor. All jobs, if staffed by women, can be sexualised. What is sexy is not the job, not even the woman, but the fact that while the woman is just doing her job you are secretly sexualising her.&quot;<p>Now I am sure there are people that find that arousing but I&#x27;ve just completed high school-university stage and my insight in my peers is a bit different. The people that say stuff like that do it mainly because they find the girl desirable, but have a problem communicating that in a normal way. In other words they are socially inexperienced and that&#x27;s their way of talking to someone of sexual interest. Overanalyzing this might say that they use insults and threats as a shield to rejection. \nPictures of naked people are wanted because they are pictures of naked people. Context matters and in some edge cases may be turned in a fetish but the main allure of almost all &quot;creepshots&quot; is sexual desirability and not the lack of consent.<p>Similarly I&#x27;ve talked to people that raped and people that were nearly stopped and the reason was always sexual tension(small sample, date rapes, rape = sex/fingering w/o consent). Control? Maybe but not the main reason at all.",1422277169

8946715,comment,8945071,8945620,0,0,jerf,,,"You just named them. You want &quot;shock&quot;, you have to offend the dominant philosophy of the elite (and especially the art elite), which is liberalism.<p>That said, there&#x27;s still a difference between &quot;I&#x27;m shocked, <i>shocked</i> I say! Everybody come join me in telling me how good I am for being shocked!&quot; (both major dominant sides do this today), and actual <i>shock</i>. All of your examples are the former. I&#x27;m not sure there much left for the latter.<p>Later edit: I&#x27;m an audience the shock artists would love to &quot;shock&quot;, and my parents are nominally their exact target, and let me tell you that if my father woke up one day and read that an artist had literally crucified himself unto literal death in Times Square, he still probably wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;shocked&quot; in any sense the artist would have been looking for. Maybe conservatives in the 50s could live in a bubble, and I do mean only maybe (many of them were in a vicious war, after all) since I didn&#x27;t live then, but I know for a fact today that &quot;the masses&quot; are already used to swimming in a culture they don&#x27;t own.<p>Further, upon more reflection: &quot;The masses&quot; don&#x27;t respect the shock artists today. It&#x27;s hard to imagine how to shock people who don&#x27;t respect you. Also, if you examine the theory of <i>why</i> the artists are trying to be shocking in the first place (in a nutshell, turning conservatives into liberals by &quot;shocking&quot; them out of their &quot;comfortable&quot; world or something), it&#x27;s pretty difficult to draw a sensible cause-to-effect line on the whole theory anyhow. Given that one of the few scientifically-well-established differences between the two cultures is in their reaction to &quot;disgust&quot;, stimulating conservative&#x27;s &quot;disgust&quot; reaction (the usual shock approach) seems more like a way designed to make conservatives <i>more</i> conservative rather than less.",1422276770

Detained suspects do not have to have their rights read to them, whereas they must be read to arrested individuals.

8946607,comment,8946138,8946138,0,0,blueskin_,,,"Nothing about the singularity specifically requires creative AI; indeed, a large part of it is <i>enhancing the existing potential of humans</i>; replacing them outright is not necessarily the case. As it is, an article titled about AI and creativity without the gratuitous &quot;singularity won&#x27;t happen&quot; would be more accurate, but so much less sensational and clickbait-y that it might not even be able to justify its own publishing, I guess.<p>Also, had to laugh at gratuitous misuse of &quot;supercomputers&quot;.<p>Yet another layman grasping at concepts they don&#x27;t understand... <i>yawn</i>. Such an interesting coincidence that someone who says &quot;AI can&#x27;t be creative&quot; also happens to be an artist... Reminds me of Roger Ebert dismissing the potential of games vs. movies as he felt threatened by them. As it is, that is one of the most gross and ignorant misunderstandings of singularity, that people will be somehow marginalised or not valued rather than the main point being the next logical step of tools (post-)humans use for their own benefit.<p>Edit: Oh, look, that whole &quot;...the greatest scientists are also artists.&quot; canard again. Why am I not surprised? There have been maybe two or three who were exceptional or even widely appreciated in both, which is indicative of a &quot;renaissance man&quot; who is proficient in many fields and not an overall tendency/requirement. While many <i>are</i> skilled in nonscientific fields too, I would hardly call Hawking, Feynman or Dawkins an artist just because they were good at speeches, lectures or books, for example.<p>I would also remind everyone that predictions of the future are so often pessimistic...<p>&quot;This &#x27;telephone&#x27; has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication.

4592419,comment,4588769,4591895,1,0,dalke,,,"There will still be a grid. The scenario you mention will be useful for some, but assuming $80/month for electricity over a paid-for grid vs. $10,000 for installation of cheap solar panels+batteries gives a pay-off time of about 10 years. (Currently solar water heaters cost about $5,000, so the best is 5 years.)<p>I don't think most will be willing to take that capital investment.<p>It would be interesting to see how distributed solar compares to grid-based distribution in the face of large disasters like a hurricane or ice storm. Especially if the power lines were underground. I assume that those with damaged panels would quickly look for replacements, causing an instant demand and price spike. While the large electricity companies would have stockpiled reserves and have agreements already in place to handle the short-term demand. I don't know how this would affect the overall long-term costs.",1348995373

We want to use the exploration map to memorize our entire life when we are old and unable to walk. We also use the map to find out places nearby where we live but we never know. We actually got surprised many times that we found a lot of new places around where we live but we hadn't been in the past ten years.<p>I visited Japan four years ago, but honestly, I really don't remember those places I had been at that time, except few really famous places. I don't even know what hotels I lived, what roads I walked that time. And that's why I build this app. Now I can see the map and memorize what happened at those places I had been.",1348995169

4592403,comment,4589971,4591501,1,0,jzwinck,,,"I've used Lonely Planet guides extensively in paperback and somewhat in Kindle form. The Kindle versions are worse in terms of usability. This is partly because the maps are usable in paper form, where it is easy to flip between the map and the legend, or indeed where they are sometimes on facing pages visible at once. The way they make the electronic versions, the maps often have a low-res overview and legible sections on separate pages. Want to move north on the map? Go forward two pages! That's just silly, a UI worse than MapQuest ten years ago.<p>What's good about LP on Kindle? If you happen to be travelling very light to several first-world destinations which are not covered in any single book, you can definitely save space and weight. Also if you buy the book more for the prose than the maps, it could be all right (with an iPad and a local SIM card this could work well enough, again assuming you don't travel where people are very poor).",1348994718

Again like one of the top comment in the thread about the Ontario map comparison. It's not about the visualization of the maps, it's not about the data, it's about search. Apple just does not have search down very well in general.<p>I think that a big thing Google Maps had over most other services was to estimate pretty well what the user is looking for even if he only has a slight idea of what he's actually looking for. And to be fair sometimes Google corrects my search results WAY too much. I can't think of examples right now but there are times where the synonym they use for a search term isn't actually a synonym in context to what I'm looking for.<p>Anyways all this Map discussion on HN has me pretty exhausted about talking about maps for a really long time.<p>PS. Reading that forum thread, I can understand the accusations that Google is lying, but the ones where people are replying to people who try to interject that Apple's Maps aren't up to snuff getting replies like, ""Do people even use Maps that much?"", or ""Do you get lost that much"" is pretty sad.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/did-googles-motorola-fake-an-ad-critical-of-apples-maps-nope?utm_campaign=tmo_story_sidebar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/did-googles-motorola-...</a>",1348994536

I decided to try a standing desk about two years ago, however, I didn't want to commit fully and we don't have desks that raise and lower automatically. I decided the best solution would be convert my lab workstation to standing. I built something to hold mouse and keyboard at proper height and raised my monitors/docking station to eye level. I also added a 3/4"" textured mat to stand on and keep a set of comfortable shoes at work.<p>My findings are that I am more alert standing up, however, I focus better on documentation while sitting down, so I alternate between the two throughout the day.

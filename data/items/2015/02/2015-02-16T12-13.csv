Today, I have some updates and a way to do the same without using this tool<p>Tweet Full (http://tweetfull.com) a tool that helps you get leads from Twitter. Instead of making this post a plug for it, I am going to give away the secret sauce so that you can use it without paying for the tool.<p>One thing that has worked wonders for me when it comes to marketing on Twitter is to feed my customers&#x27; ego.<p>I used Twitter advanced search to find people who were Tweeting with my keywords of interest. Then I would engage with those Tweets by simply Favoriting or RTing those Tweets. This was not as obtrusive as starting a conversation with them, yet it made them curious enough to check out my profile.<p>Then I would use a pinned Tweet with a great call to action (20% off right away) that would encourage them to click on my link. I also had a link to the startup/product I was promoting.<p>My Twitter analytics showed me crazy growth doing this. I was getting 2-3X impressions spending only an hour or so doing this. You can use this method for your own use without paying anybody.<p>Then I thought of automating it and someone posted on Reddit about Tweet Full (http://tweetfull.com). It had additional bells and whistles like I could search for people with certain words in their Twitter Bios (Twitter search doesn&#x27;t do that), filter by their Klout score and most importantly ability to pick Tweets with certain sentiment. It is a decent growth hacking tool for Twitter that produces results.<p>With Tweet Full I am getting over 70K impressions on my profile a month and 1-2% of these people engage with me via Tweets. I use Tweet Deck to keep up with all of the accounts I manage and to engage in a conversation with those who Tweet Back at me. Many times it is automated &quot;Thank you for Fav&quot; Tweets but many a times I have gotten legit customers.<p>Hope you like it.",1424091433

9056665,comment,9055869,9056291,0,0,pluma,,,"&quot;Agreed&quot; is also such a weasely claim.<p>And of course the &quot;harm caused to copyright holders&quot; is a farcical concept to begin with. You can&#x27;t just take, say, the total number of downloads and multiply that with some fictitious amount of lost revenue and then claim that as damage, yet that&#x27;s exactly what the rights utilization industry has been doing for decades.<p>This concept is based on the idea of physical <i>theft</i>. If I steal a truckload of soap and then sell it myself, the damage I&#x27;m doing to the legitimate owner is equivalent to the volume I stole multiplied by the original selling price minus regular shrinkage (e.g. lost sales because of faulty products, damage during regular handling or natural expiry).<p>Digital goods don&#x27;t work that way. The &quot;theft&quot; of digital goods does not result in you having less products to sell. Instead it&#x27;s more similar to the damage done via the &quot;theft&quot; of trade secrets. If I steal the Coca Cola recipe and begin giving away knock-off cola for free, I arguably cause damages due to lost sales, but it&#x27;d be ridiculous to assume that every &quot;sale&quot; of my product is equivalent to one lost sale of the Coca Cola company.<p>In fact, MegaUpload didn&#x27;t even &quot;steal&quot; anything. If we want to use physical crimes as metaphors, it&#x27;s simply dealing with stolen goods -- or more precisely: giving stolen goods away for free. And if one million users downloaded the same illegal content, they didn&#x27;t give one million stolen goods away, they merely gave the same stolen goods away a million times.<p>It&#x27;s not that copyright violations can&#x27;t cause damages, but the current system for valuation of those damages -- especially in the US -- is entirely ridiculous and only continues to exist because the courts are either too apathetic or too ignorant (or sometimes both) to dismiss it.",1424091228

9056662,comment,9056319,9056319,0,0,aaronem,,,"Peter Watts&#x27;s <i>Blindsight</i> - easily the best SF novel I&#x27;ve read in the last decade. I haven&#x27;t got round to <i>Echopraxia</i> yet, but I doubt it&#x27;ll fail to live up to its predecessor.<p>Also, while I have no use whatsoever for Stross&#x27;s &quot;Singularity&quot; stuff, his Laundry Files series excels, especially for an inveterate old Lovecraft fan such as myself. If you want a taste, there are some shorts available online -- &quot;Overtime&quot; and &quot;Funny Farm&quot; are good places to start; &quot;Equoid&quot; is the most recent, but it&#x27;s not representative, and it&#x27;s also the weakest entry in the series as a whole due to its poor characterization and reliance on shock and gruesomeness rather than the more insidious sort of horror in which the rest of the series specializes.<p>I&#x27;m sort of surprised to see that no one has yet mentioned Heinlein; I know he&#x27;s a politically divisive figure in the fandom, to say the least, but he&#x27;s also the great granddaddy of the modern field, and such prominence deserves recognition. (Hell, he was pushing the Rapture of the Nerds before any of its modern adherents was even <i>born</i>!) Granted that his later works tend to bog down in self-referentiality and author tracts on the evils of Communism and the benefits of casual nudism; in his prime, though, he was an author and storyteller practically beyond compare.<p>In particular, his <i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i> remains a classic among classics; <i>The Puppet Masters</i> even more so, to the extent of spawning practically a whole subgenre of second-rate imitations; and, for a lighter entry, his oft-overlooked <i>The Door into Summer</i> is a sweet story in which all&#x27;s well that ends well and the importance of feline companionship in a well-rounded life is not overlooked.",1424091211

You have an array of string values.
You use the .map function to iterate through all the strings.
For each string you change the string to whatever is returned from $(x).val()<p>(basically just juggling data, you should make a real world example.)<p>I have seen Jquery before so I know $ returns a document element. And if you pass # into it, it will return getElementById(). 
And .val() returns .value<p>So my guess is that you want to get the values of hp, mp, gp, whatever that is. I don&#x27;t understand why you want them in an array though!? Wouldn&#x27;t it be better to store them in an associative array? So that you don&#x27;t have to remember what position in the array points to what value.<p>Try this instead:<p><pre><code>  var signupForm = getFormData(&quot;signupForm&quot;);
  alert( &quot;Your name is &quot; + signupForm[&quot;name&quot;] );

</code></pre>
Or without the abstraction:<p><pre><code>  var name = document.getElementById(&quot;name&quot;).value;
</code></pre>
A little more characters to type, but you don&#x27;t have to learn a framework to know what it does. A trick here is to use keyboard macros to do the boilerplate. Don&#x27;t var PI = Math.PI because of laziness.",1424089978

I can assure you, my goal of splitting up the content into a book series had ZERO to do with making more money. It&#x27;s actually quite the opposite. One of the things I hate the most about tech books is that I spend $35-50 on a big book of which there&#x27;s only a few chapters I actually care about. I almost never read a whole book.<p>I decided when I wrote this content that I&#x27;d make each logical chunk of content available separately, which means that you can buy <i>only</i> the stuff that you actually care about. This COULD quite likely mean that I make a lot less money in the overall picture, because there will be plenty of people who don&#x27;t buy all the books, or even not enough of them that would have generated the same income as a single book would have.<p>This places you, the reader, more in control, not only of what you buy and own, but more deeply of what you spend your money on compared to the content you get. Rather than being about me greedily making more money, it rather downgrades my ability to make bigger chunks of money per copy for the majority of people who (like me) only want/need part of the content.<p>With regards to this content being &quot;pointless&quot;, that seems quite a spurious and unsubstantiated claim. Pointless to you? Perhaps. But I feel quite certain there&#x27;s a lot of content in there (like block scoping, etc) that most developers (and perhaps even you) aren&#x27;t fully aware of. If you&#x27;re already a JS expert (even on all the new ES6 stuff coming), then you probably <i>do</i> know JS and I&#x27;m not sure why you bought the book.<p>The spirit of the whole series (given the title) is to get us all (myself included) to admit how we don&#x27;t fully know JS and how we need to dig deeper than we have before. If that&#x27;s lost on you, I&#x27;m sorry.<p>One last comment: these books are all available fully for free to read here: <a href=""http://YouDontKnowJS.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://YouDontKnowJS.com</a> In addition, Amazon&#x27;s site makes preview snippets of the book available to read for free so you can get an idea of what you&#x27;re buying.

I held almost exactly the same view on hard scifi, and was similarly obsessed with Arthur C Clarke. But I&#x27;ve since loosened my definition of scifi for a couple of reasons:<p>a) I now think of scifi as any work intended to do more than tell a story or explore a world. Focussing on just hard scifi causes great works of social and sociology fiction like The Dispossessed to be left without a clear pigeonhole. Which is a great pity, IMO.<p>Perhaps the biggest chunk that gets miscategorized is cyberpunk; works like Snow Crash and Hardwired are clearly about more than whether the ending is happy or sad, or whether the hero gets the girl. Doesn&#x27;t seem right to categorize them as fantasy. Better to narrow Arthur C Clarke into the sub-category of hard scifi. Loosening my uptight definition caused me to better appreciate Snow Crash in particular on a second reading a decade later. It&#x27;s aged wonderfully.<p>You could even imagine a book with fantasy &#x27;props&#x27; that feels scifi-like. I haven&#x27;t seen it yet, but I have no doubt it can be done. (Any recommendations from others?)<p>b) Not even everything Arthur C Clarke wrote was hard. Rama series, c&#x27;mon! Kim Stanley Robinson is a great author, but I fail to see how he&#x27;s &#x27;more hard&#x27; than Asimov or Heinlein. Somebody described the Red Mars series to me as a reality show with dune buggies, and that seems about right. You certainly couldn&#x27;t call it &#x27;more hard&#x27; than Anathem.<p>Anyways, for hard scifi readers the top author today is probably Greg Egan. That I think everybody can agree on.

Some of the executives would come with a slide deck briefly explaining what they did, something about the company, etc. Johnny just came in, sat on a stool in the middle of the stage, said &quot;What would you like to know?&quot;, and started taking questions.<p>About 20 minutes in to the conversation, one student asked him: &quot;Why are so many of Apple&#x27;s products white?&quot; I think all of us expected some long explication of the clean and unassuming quality of white as a color.<p>Instead, Johnny closed his eyes, took a breath, and said (as best as I can recall), &quot;Imagine something that doesn&#x27;t exist. Imagine something completely new. A new shape. A new device...&quot; After a beat he continued, &quot;Can you imagine something like that?&quot; At this point he was obviously doing the very thing he was suggesting we all try.

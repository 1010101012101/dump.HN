If you are relying on some piece of work being done for product/project success, this approach can also be disastrous because people will say ""Yes"" to some request that they have absolutely no intention of performing/completing and you may not find out something wasn't done until something fails.<p>That being said, it's not a race issue, but a cultural issue. Someone of Chinese or Indian descent raised in the US are unlikely to present this cultural incompatibility.<p>On the otherhand, I think that if this cultural incompatibility exists, it is the manager's responsibility to neutralize it by demonstrating that delivering bad news (or saying ""no"" when the answer is in fact ""no"") is valued. This would be preferable to declining a good candidate for the task at hand.",1292082556

An essay like ""Why nerds are unpopular"" goes a long way to getting some perspective on why you might be different.<p>Finally, as others mentioned, use the loneliness to your advantage.

1994993,comment,1994671,1994671,0,0,Knack,,,"Often it's a vicious circle. You're shy, introverted with a lack of self esteem. So you start avoiding social interaction. Also if you're in an interaction you can't enjoy it. You often are afraid to act non-conformal. Avoidance leads to less self-esteem and social skills and so on.<p>You need to tackle the problem on all fronts.<p>1) This is about your learned behaviour. You have to relearn. As some mentioned before, do some training. Stuff like going out alone. There're programs for stuff like that. Do it professional! That's the most important thing right now in your life! Don't rely only on internet ressource, even if they can be a great inspiration. Go to a therapist if you think that your shyness (or social phobia) is a problem, e.g. if you can't go to salsa dancing because you're to shy. You <i>must</i> break the avoidance circle.<p>2) Work on your own thinking process. Often, people don't know their own needs or don't dare to stand up for them and try to compensate by being great to get attention. That's a dead-end street. If you don't understand how you ""work"", the training ( 1) ) can only be of shallow impact. It's really important to unveil your thougts and emotions. I like the Yoga approach very much. To me, it's sound and practical. swamij.com is the greatest resource on the planet. It's a lot and takes time to understand. You could start at the articles about Karma. The kind of awareness and unattachment you step by step achieve makes you stronger. Stronger to understand and handle your legitimate desires. (which does not mean, supress them. In your case, don't supress your loneliness but go out to socialise. But overcome your fear and go to the salsa dancing event.)",1292082519

In fact, most of the time if you give some technologically illiterate people a URL, they will not enter it in the browser address bar, but instead type the URL into Google. Google will then give results for something like www.mydomain.com and people will click through to that site.<p>It is entirely conceivable that Google eventually puts links to it's Chrome webstore apps as sponsored links in the future, once this happens, users who look for your site through Google should find two links for you, one sponsored via the Chrome store and one unsponsored which is the actual link to your site.<p>If you use the Chrome store for monetization, you ostensibly give up margin to Google. For this reason I would put a free app to my site in the Chrome appstore and monetize people directly on my site. To do otherwise would mean giving up margins unnecessarily to Google.<p>Of course, this doesn't happen now.

Keep in mind, as the OP and author, I'm comparing the ""average"" embedded job or desktop software job to the ""average"" web job. Perhaps I should have made this distinction clearer in the blog article. Most employed embedded engineers do not work on problems as tough as the ones which you describe.<p>But to me, the biggest challenge with web is the unforgiving avalanche of emerging new technologies a practicing professional must keep abreast of, literally during every spare second of their life, if he or she is to remain employed !! This unrelenting blizzard of new algorithms, new languages, new frameworks, new design methodologies is just another typical day in the life of a highly competent and employable web engineer.<p>The resource-limited embedded problems at your company are ""old school"".

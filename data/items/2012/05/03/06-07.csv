3922668,comment,3919429,3920404,3,0,cbsmith,,,"Cache wasn't mentioned in the question... there might be no cache at all. ;-)<p>Cache oblivious B-trees aren't exactly oblivious to how DRAM behaves, and sometimes their operation actually can be counter to what works best in DRAM (though I agree that generally they tend to do better than data structures that are ""oblivious"" in a very different sense).<p>But let's ignore that for a moment. Okay, you aren't using BerkeleyDB, MySQL, or any other of the common B-trees out there, but instead you've got your hands on a cache oblivious b-tree. What is the approximate optimal fanout rate and what is the approximate number of reads per second you can achieve with the 7-7-7-23 DDR3 memory (or memory of your choice that is commonly found in modern systems)?<p>The question <i>isn't</i> really about knowing the specifics of a particular memory infrastructure. It's about understanding the cost of going to memory, which is increasingly as important as understanding disk latency (you know how ""disk is the new tape""? well, RAM is the new ""disk"").<p>Interestingly, a lot of databases these days are CPU bound , particularly when working with big data, but even in other cases. They aren't <i>really</i> CPU bound, it just looks like that because of how accounting is done. When you poke under the covers, you see the CPU pipelines are comparatively idle because the CPU's are all tied up accessing memory.<p>Particularly if you are using AWS or other virtualization services, most web applications these days rely on servicing a majority of their requests entirely from memory. Being able to understand the performance characteristics of memory at least within an order of magnitude becomes increasingly important, because the average rate that you can service from memory becomes a critical metric for the scaling of your services.<p>It's more than even that though. As concurrency becomes increasingly important, locks and atomics become central to a lot of work. The last few iterations of Moore's law have changed the principles of how locks & CAS impact performance. It <i>used</i> to be that locks were bad, because you often burned up CPU going down to the kernel, but more than that because suddenly you are wasting CPU while you wait for something else to complete. CAS allowed you to largely sidestep all that CPU wasting and you're a happy man. Then CAS got integrated in to locks so that locks only really sucked when you had contention, but now... The real expensive cost of a lock these days is the memory fence put around it. CAS is better because the fence is scoped to only the object being swapped, but <i>even that</i> can be horribly expensive if there is contention on the object. Having a clear understanding of just how big that cost is relative to burning some more CPU, wasting some RAM, or even changing the constraints for your code, can be very important.<p>Trust me. This stuff really matters for any context where performance matters, and it is only going to get more important in the coming years. Memory has pretty much already trumped CPU in terms of its importance for most applications, and the number of cases for which it is more important than disk is growing at a rapid rate.",1336027018

There was a time when using roads wasnt linked to driving in a car, but theres not much point in going back to that time.<p>While I only have an undergraduate degree in Psychology and there are others who can speak to this topic in a lot more detail, I feel it allows me to say with confidence that the main concern is that the potential threat of limited time in our hectic lives being seeped from us by the internet (and technology in general) comes with the responsibility to use self control more than ever. Walking away from the internet for a year doesn't solve issues with self control and in a world so tightly integrated to the ""new fangled"" technological tools we use each day to make our lives easier, it's our responsibility to manage that, not walk away from it. To each their own and in the end, this was broadcast partially for page views, but embracing changing lifestyles and new technologies comes with personal responsibility. We all assess and compare ourselves with others to make sure we don't get carried away, but that doesn't mean we should walk away from something.

The problem with it is that rather than translating nouns it ends up translating verbs. This is not really a good practice. For eg. ""we will"" gets translated to ""nous allons"". However, it's more important in this case to understand the verb conjugations of ""aller""(to go) and how it is used in the future tense. Knowing that ""we will"" can be translated as ""nous allons"" is not useful - without the context.<p>One thing my French teacher keeps telling us is to not use a dictionary. Why is that? Because then everytime I try to speak/write in French I end up constructing the sentence in English and then translating it. This is a bad way of using a language. If I were to learn a language from scratch and independently, I can use it much better. Even though I'm not a native English speaker I'm able to think, write and speak in English without too much effort because inside my head I don't translate it from my mother tongue.<p>Putting the level of the extension on ""fluent"" seems to be useful.

And that's no doubt what some people are trying to do (e.g. the Russians).<p>But all VOIP codecs are not created equal.  Skype's success is not due to NAT piercing.  Even though Skype easy to use, maybe easier than previous SIP alternatives, if calls sounded terrible, people would not use it.  Skype's success is due to being usable and having decent sound quality.  They did not use the decades old codecs other softphones used.  They wrote new ones.  And anyone can use them.<p>Using the same codec as Skype uses should not in any way bind you to their network.  It has nothing to do with compatibility.  It has to due with getting Skype-level sound quality.  Quality that the older codecs have failed to deliver.<p>It's easy to get people to sign up for free voice and video calls.  The key word is ""free"".  You do not have to find inroads into the ""Skype user base"".  Skype spread by word of mouth.  If people learn about another client that works as well or better (same sound quality), and it's easy to use, they will almost certainly try it.<p>Forgive me if I have misunderstood what you were trying to say in your comment.

I'm also skeptical of this experiment though.<p>Sunchips specifies 14 weeks in a hot and active compost. A new compost pile (like in the experiment) would not be very active compared to an old one, especially since he didn't add any worms to it but he did get the water and turning right. He also mentions that it was cold and rainy in the weeks after he started his compost. An old compost would shrug this off but it would have a negative effect on a newly started compost.",1336024910

I build expensive beautiful custom-designed websites on open source CMS platforms (mostly Concrete5 these days, which is ideal for the kinds of sites I do). But 90% of people don't need that and I refer a lot of people to Weebly. And it seems that most of the innovation in CMS's these days is happening with hosted services, so it will be very interesting to see how things play out over the next 5 years.",1336024817

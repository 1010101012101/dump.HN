You can read books (and certainly will while doing number 1) but if you don't actually take the time to sit down and build something, you'll never get a good enough feel for how to program. <p>Once you've iterated that loop a couple of times, you'll realize you've done it all wrong.

It's a Coke/Pepsi decision and the major players are so entrenched that they can continue to dominate, even among the liberal arts schools.<p>That's not to say regional elites can't emerge (see Wash U and Emory) just that the system is tied to the culture. Where technology fascinates me is in the meritocracy of great work. But even then the major players (Gates, Bezos, Yang, Googlers) had the authenticity stamp that an elite association afforded. <p>You can get a great education at probably more than two hundred schools in the US alone. But if given the choice, I bet most would choose the brand over the unknown. How can we quantify an education and how can a new product demonstrate its superiority to influence that choice?<p>",1190677911

For example, the curriculum of primary schools can't change because of high school admissions, high schools can't change because of college admissions, and colleges can't change because of U.S. News & World Report.<p>There a couple of solutions. First, as you suggest, the system could be completely circumvented. Second, the system as a whole could become less tightly coupled so that, for example, high school grades and SATs have much less influence on college admissions. There have been a couple of proposals along these lines. <p>To me though it seems like the system isn't going away and there is no practical way to make it less tightly coupled.<p>I think the most practical is to add a new layer to the top of the stack that will pull on everything underneath.

Every business has warts, so it shouldn't be too hard to find some.  If the business in question is a complete startup or is in 'stealth mode', I ask them to list things they dislike about the general industry we're operating in.  <p>I want to hire employees that are honest and will work to improve our business.  Asking this question helps me screen for brown-nosers, it leads to the obvious follow-up question of how they would change things to improve them, and it also really gives me an insight into how they think.  It also shows me how much research they've done and how much industry knowledge they have.  I've actually created new positions for people based on their answers to this question...it can be really enlightening.

GE had encountered a \n    performance problem with one of their huge electrical generators and had \n    been absolutely unable to correct it. Steinmetz, a genius in his \n    understanding of electromagnetic phenomena, was brought in as a consultant \n    -- not a very common occurrence in those days, as it would be now.\n\n    Steinmetz also found the problem difficult to diagnose, but for some days \n    he closeted himself with the generator, its engineering drawings, paper and \n    pencil. At the end of this period, he emerged, confident that he knew how \n    to correct the problem.\n\n    After he departed, GE's engineers found a large ""X"" marked with chalk on \n    the side of the generator casing. There also was a note instructing them to \n    cut the casing open at that location and remove so many turns of wire from \n    the stator. The generator would then function properly.\n\n    And indeed it did.\n\n    Steinmetz was asked what his fee would be. Having no idea in the world what \n    was appropriate, he replied with the absolutely unheard of answer that his \n    fee was $1000.\n\n    Stunned, the GE bureaucracy then required him to submit a formally itemized \n    invoice.\n\n    They soon received it. It included two items:\n\n        1. Marking chalk ""X"" on side of generator: $1.\n        2. Knowing where to mark chalk ""X"": $999.\n</code></pre>",1190675099

You can start a project in one of the open source communities like sourceforge put some high level specs and see whether any one will be interested in joining you.""<p>This is a rather persistent myth about Open Source.  It's entirely fiction.  If you post a working version to sf.net, you'll probably get a few bug reports and a few questions.  If you work on it for a year, and do something really valuable to a lot of people, you'll see a few patches.  If you work on it for another year, and continue to add value for a large technical audience, you may have a few parties who are interested in joining the project in a serious way.<p>Open Source software does not spring into existence.  Nearly every project has one (or more) extremely dedicated developers pushing it forward every day.  A non-programmer wishing something into existence is not going to make anything happen.

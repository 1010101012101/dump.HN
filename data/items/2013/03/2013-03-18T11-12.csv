5393589,comment,5393367,5393555,10,0,objclxt,,,"Firstly, the laws around this sort of thing are <i>very</i> stupid. But with that said...I'm not wholly sympathetic here.<p>The disclosure was <i>totally botched</i>. The IRC logs that came out during the case showed that Andrew and Dan (Spitler) talked about shorting AT&T stock (they ended up not doing this, but it's not the sort of thing you talk about), and going directly to news organisations, bypassing AT&T. They also considered (perhaps jokingly, but again, not something you joke about) selling the e-mail addresses to spammers.<p>Andrew also initially told Gawker he'd disclosed to AT&T, when in fact he hadn't (Ars has a good summary here[1]).<p>I am definitely not saying that a ten year sentence is warranted, or that any sort of custodial sentence is appropriate. In fact, I doubt he'll be given 10 years, more like 2-4 (since his fellow defendant, who plead guilty, got 12-18 months). But I do think the disclosure was handled really, really badly. I've found and disclosed very similar vulnerabilities - I would not leak the entire database out. That's just crazy.<p>Again, it's the old black/grey/white hat argument again. But to go public without <i>even informing</i> AT&T doesn't endear him to me.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/01/goatse-security-trolls-were-after-max-lols-in-att-ipad-hack/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/01/goatse-security-trolls-...</a>",1363607885

Given the cost, I also wonder how well will it hold up to EU and US crash tests.<p>Also, the brochure says it's top speed is 83km/h (51mph). The Leaf can do 150km/h. Additionally, the kerb weight of the E2O is 830kg. The Leaf is 1521kg & the G-Wiz is 400kg.<p>This car isn't a revolution, it's just a built up G-Wiz. The E20 and the G-Wiz have similar speed limitations and range.

Genetic diversity however is not the only or even primary determining factor in just about any measure of human success, including generating Churchills.<p>Absurdity: This creates an imperative to reproduce as rapidly as possible and maximize genetic diversity, without regard to the resources or environment available.

This was with only two developers, and like with most frameworks the first 80% went extremely fast but we ended up fighting against it for the last 20%. The performance, especially on older Androids, was unacceptable.<p>But instead of doing another complete 180 we decided to instead go with a hybrid approach like LinkedIn did - use native when performance is key, and HTML5 everywhere else. We just re-launched the app using all custom html5/js/css and native ui elements and animations where necessary and it was a complete success. Not only does the app perform really well on even very old Android phones, but it absolutely flies on newer devices. The best part, especially when compared to using Sencha, is that all of our code which was written in angular.js will be used on the web app and native desktop apps. We are very close to having the vast majority of our code being shared between every major platform our users may use.<p>I love when articles like these get popular because it scares people away from using HTML5 in any way and gives us a clear advantage.

Even further, it's good advice for any service you use that has a public component. I love tumblr, but if they were to go out of business tomorrow then foobar.tumblr.com isn't going to mean much.

It is unfortunate.<p>Discussing things in terms of the ""universe"" is simply with respect to an alternate universe. ""One universe no babies are aborted"" and the other ""Universe where babies are aborted"". The former has greater opportunity for outpacing the information than the second. True, my first argument is not making much of a statement about society or morality - just information.<p>1C) Correct, but it should be noted that there is a difference between the /gain and loss/ of information in a system, versus merely the /total/ information in a system. So here are the differences: ""+1 +2 = +3"", ""+1 -1 +2 = +2"", ""+2 = +2"". While a family might eventually have 2 children after they aborted 1, that is not necessarily mutually exclusive from them having had 3.<p>I unfortunately have to play the <a href=""http://overpopulationisamyth.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://overpopulationisamyth.com/</a> card. While I understand that vast majority of people are frightened about and do not encourage people having ""large families"", it is all based on an irrational fear originating in Malthus' wrong mathematics. He forgot to calculate for technology.<p>Technology, interestingly enough, is a direct result of available information within a system, and the collaboration of multiple minds. This really is where the (seemingly obscure?) comments on ""universe and information"" become consequential to human behavior and development.<p>2. True -- history is a massive selective bias. And this is my point, great people come from horrible as well as fantastic backgrounds.<p>2A. No no, I was actually saying that abortion could have killed Hitler in the same way it could have killed Da`Vinci. I was being realistic.<p>2B. Yes! There is a uniform distribution of a variety of potential personalities (from opposite extremes of Hitler and Churchill, and everywhere inbetween) in the continual development of a human from zygote to adult. You will get diversity.<p>Abortion, instead, shrinks this diversity. Which is bad, because then you don't get the extremes that push humanity forward (as well as the ones that push it back). But a plus-sum gain is always better than a zero-sum gain. Abortion, by its virtue of destroying information, is a reduction.<p>Because I am interested in the /origins/ of the woman that was or was not aborted.

Pretty much everyone who can be admitted to a Ph.D., funded is a guaranteed admit to a pro programme that will on average make them more money.<p>One should do a Ph.D. if one will not regret it even if one never holds a faculty position, i.e. it's more consumption than investment, or if one got into a TOP programme in one's chosen field. Economics seems to be in the process of collapsing from top 5/6 to top 2, CS has been 4 for a long time, but the principle is the same everywhere.",1363605345

Destroys information from the universe.<p>Does erasing a blackboard or wiping a hard drive destroy information from the universe? I can hardly think of an action that doesn't destroy information. Moving destroys the information of where we were immediately before. Think destroys the thoughts we had prior. Do we have a moral imperative to preserve everything that exists in the present? If so, we are pretty screwed. BTW, information can not be destroyed from the universe, but that's a bit pedantic and beside the point.<p>> B. Destroys /genetic information/, which is an evolutionary mechanism.<p>Your body constantly creates unused genetic material in the form of billions of sperm each day. You can argue that a zygote is more complete genetic information, but it is (almost) no more information than the sperm and egg contain separately. Better stop beating it - every sperm really is sacred to the universe.<p>> C. Slows evolutionary development, as beneficial mutations are already rare enough - increased abortions also increase the loss of a punctuated-equilibrium event.<p>Seriously? This doesn't deserve a direct response, but it's addressed below.<p>Apparently we have a moral obligation to produce a maximal number of offspring and ensure that every egg is fertilized. Otherwise, we are robbing the universe of its precious information and stopping our evolution. That is the logical corollary of your silly rationalizations for why you oppose abortion. And if we are supposed to help evolution along, shouldn't we stop allowing stupid and fat people to breed and preserve our resources for the most fit? No, because none of what you say is the basis for any sort of morals - it's complete nonsense.<p>Side point: Animals kill their unfit young, or young they are unable to care for. Are they also stopping evolution and sinning against the universe? Or are they contributing to evolution by removing poor genes, and contributing to the survival and health of the species by preserving resources for young that can be cared for. Or is evolution an undirected process, which can't be ""stopped?"" Oh yeah, I forgot.<p>The second part just reinforces your idea that we are morally obligated to maximize our offspring to create as much genetic diversity as possible, which is on its face ridiculous. Of course, you neglect that genetic diversity is not the only, or even the primary determinate of whether we have ""Hitlerbabies"" or Churchills. In fact, much if not most of the difference is environmental, which incidentally is helped by aborting babies that will not be raised in a healthy environment, and are therefor more likely to bring violence and suffering to the world. Maximizing births is not the way to produce your uberman.<p>I'm not sure why I bothered responding, this is such a load of nonsense.",1363604453

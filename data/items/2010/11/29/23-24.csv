She's going to college because her hands have arthritis and she can't continue to cut hair (her current profession) for much longer.  I'm trying to teach her in one semester stuff that took me a year to learn when I was in eighth grade.  I told her the class was going to be tough.  I told her it would require a lot of effort on her part and that it would be frustrating.  Her response was, ""Well, I have a life outside of school and work and I'm not going to sacrifice it.""  I knew then she would fail.  She dropped a few weeks ago.<p>B is Hmong barely speaks English, has 7 kids, a job and never went to school as a child.  She's getting an A.<p>Is A's failure my fault?  Is B's success my fault?<p>My experience is that groups 2, 4 as you label them are a large majority of the students I encounter.  I can't force a student to be willing to sit down and do problems.  And algebra is a subject that requires you to do problems to get it.  If a student isn't motivated there isn't much I can do.<p>Learning is work.  It requires effort.  It's frustrating.

I see what you're saying about being on the board, etc. and you're right, I haven't thought that part out ... this may be a deal that's better for ""passive"" investors, who don't want to really have to deal with control of the company.<p>But ask yourself, though. If you invested $200,000 into a company, wouldn't you want that company to become profitable or raise a larger round before it ran out of money? Wouldn't you be nervous if it spent $180,000 and YOU were its only hope?<p>On the flip side, often founders need only around $20-50k before launching something. If things don't go as planned, they may need as much as $100,000 due to unforeseen circumstances. Unless you can predict the future, a range would work better than a set amount. So I think it makes sense to set aside the maximum amount of that range, but have the option of raising the second round early, before using up the whole range. The reason that the founder has to explicitly draw money on the allotted amount, is to prevent ""giving back the money to the investor"" when they have found a better deal, which wouldn't be fair. But I think this scheme is fair to both parties. Why exploit the inefficiency of a founder to be unable to predict the future? Make your money on the actual rise in the company's value.

The improvement is dramatic.<p>In the next generations there is unlikely to be a gender issue; we are just in a transition where gender differences previously not considered an issue are a problem. It's not a fast process; but it is kicked off. And we are approaching the end game.

Having achieved six figure salaries by surviving school politics they contribute as little as possible to their students while punching their ticket each year until retirement. The good teachers are not rewarded but penalized for not going along with policies created to benefit administrators.<p>Having excelled at politics as a teacher the administrators are interested in nothing more than having days without problems.

So you start with one niche and then scale out intelligently from there. Again, this is what Groupon did by starting in SF and then growing from there.</i><p>Sorry I was unclear - all 5 of the ideas were meant to be implemented in specific locales then expanding.<p><i>Is there a city in the world that has a lot of people taking cabs from the airport?</i><p>Every airport that I frequent regularly has this problem: Boston, NYC (x3), SF and Toronto. I think this would not be useful in some of the developing countries. I'd be willing to bet this would be useful for any airport where 1) there is a significant metropolitan core in a small constrained geographic area and 2) Where labor costs are high enough that the majority of the cost of the cab comes from driver wages/compensation.<p><i>Actually, now that I think about it. Any ""route"" where a sufficiently large number of people would regularly be paying a substantial cab fare would almost certainly have an alternative means of transportation. Whether this be public transportation, shuttle services, etc. More often than not I think you'd find that society at large has already implemented your taxi sharing.</i><p>Agreed but every mode of transport has a cost/convenience tradeoff. Public transit is generally cheap but takes some time. Single occupancy cabs are at the other end of the spectrum. And if you plotted every mode I don't believe the curve would be linear. Take for example shuttle services that are common in the US, specifically one from Boston airport to MIT. They typically serve ~8 passengers and cost roughly $20/person in my experience. This is fairly expensive relative to a cab that shares a ~$35 cab ride even among just two people. At $17.5/person it is much much faster to get to your destination in this method. There seems to be a sweet spot served by shared taxis specifically.<p>The above is just for airports - another environment where this may work is in dense urban environments for short trips. I'm picturing going crosstown in Manhattan. For it to be useful, there would need to be sufficiently large number of users such that matching friction would be low enough that it didn't impact already low travel distances.<p><i>Though your idea has given me another idea. An app that lets taxi drivers schedule with individuals directly. How many times do you take a taxi where the driver will give you their card and say ""Give me a call if you want a ride?"" Well, if you have an app that connects drivers with riders in an easy fashion, then you can get into a situation where everybody's incentives are aligned. You can get the driver to give the rider a discount, the driver does this for guaranteed income, the rider does it for the discount, and you do it because you get a small cut. You can then expand into a ""group ride"" policy because your already having a person plan out their route.</i><p>UberCab? Rather Uber",1291073356

There's a lot of good reasons for schools to have rigid rules other than the cynical idea that schools are purely there to teach kids to conform so that they'll make good, obedient workers.<p>For one, parents expect that schools are, at least to some extent, keeping their kids safe and out of trouble during school hours. It may not always work out that way, but when the rule is that they have to be in class, at least the school isn't endorsing them leaving, so there's a lot less liability.<p>Also, there's a lot of gray area that arises if you start making exceptions. How old is old enough for high achievers to skip school? Obviously, you're not going to let a first grader skip school, but when does it start becoming ok? And how high achieving do they have to be? If a kid has a B+ in one class, is he still allowed to skip school? And when do you tell a straight-A student whose grades start to slip that he has to start coming to class again? If he gets one B on one test, that's probably just a fluke, but where do you draw the line and tell him he's not doing well enough?<p>Plus the lower-achieving kids would complain of unfairness. And it's a lot harder to enforce rules against truancy when some people are allowed to leave. People would see kids leaving school, but might assume that they're just approved truants.<p>It also raises the incentive to cheat. A student could cheat on every assignment and test to keep up his A averages so that he can keep skipping school, and then he'd really be learning absolutely nothing. That's an extreme case, and he'd probably get caught eventually, but when you reward high marks on tests, people will go to great lengths to do better, but they might not be the lengths you want.",1291071818

Sadly; by addressing <i>every</i> perceived offence it trivializes the issue and persists the problem.<p>Treating someone differently because they have attitude incompatible with current society (with the caveat, of course, that it is someone from the older generation) is problematic.<p>It is not right to consider things such as this as cluelessness. Because the cluenessness is in the people taking offence at very little. Actually; I can understand those taking personal offence. And indeed support a reasoned plea for more sensitivity.<p>But I can't agree with those pointing out possible or perceived offence. Sure, if there is intent to be sexist or imply female developers are not welcome, I am with you. But as there is not, this is simply creating a problem that does not exist. The cluelessness is in believing there is a problem here; there is only a problem if one is created.<p>I'm sure such things are done in good faith; but it is casing more problem and masking genuine offence.<p>There is <i>never</i> anything wrong in a word. Only in the intent.",1291071744

Must we pretend that the world was never that way, or pretend that everything that happened in that world was evil because of it?<p>Those who jump on the slightest whisper that men and women, or people of different races, or cultures, or whatever, might be different in some ways are deluding themselves. That's not to say that we can put a value on any of these differences, nor that these differences are any more than statistical tendencies and not applicable to individuals.",1291071602

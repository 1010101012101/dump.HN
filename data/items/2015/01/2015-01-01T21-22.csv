I explained that it was just a web proxy and that there was no malware or stolen passwords. A week or two later they emailed me that I was correct, but they were going to keep my site offline and change their TOS to forbid proxy sites. (As far as I know they never did change their TOS, so GoPee should still be safe.)<p>On Nodejitsu, someone tweeted links to porn that went through my proxy, and they disabled the site thinking that I was using their service to host porn. The CEO told me that they&#x27;d turn it back on if I added user accounts and a way to ban users. But at that point, I had a newborn son and was in no mood to put a bunch of development work into making my anonymous proxy not-so-anonymous.<p>So, right now, it&#x27;s still offline.

My process of discovering that the specific parts of the Bible are not verifiable, while the verifiable parts of the Bible are not specific, involved learning all the original languages of the Bible, reading through the Bible in its entirety in those original languages, and meanwhile learning about the verifiable history of the times and places described in the Bible. Simply put, whoever wrote the Bible was not infallible, but sadly very fallible indeed. And that shows that the Bible is not God&#x27;s word revealed to us, as I was taught in my youth, but rather a collection of human stories and speculation about God, which anyone has the right to disagree with, as the overall description of God and his attributes is not even consistent among the various Biblical writings.",1420149021

An incomplete list of what the software must do includes:<p>1) Provide basic flight control services through the control laws that transform pilot intent into commands to individual flight control surfaces<p>2) Basic and advanced navigation (GPS, TACAN)<p>3) Sensor fusion. Taking in data streams from multiple types of sensors and presenting a coherent picture to the pilot of the space surrounding the aircraft, notifying the pilot of dangers and target opportunities<p>4) Stores management. Keeping track of the ordnance loaded on each station of the aircraft so that the flight control system can compensate as weapons are launched. Communicating with active weapons so that they have the necessary targeting information.<p>5) Electronic warfare, jamming, and countermeasures.<p>6) Operational mission plan. Fans of the old Microprose flight sims would recognize this as a set of instructions that tell the jet something like -- 1) Takeoff from Sicily 2) Destroy missile boat 3) Destroy SAM Radar at Benghazi...etc.<p>7) Data links to other aircraft, satellites, and ground systems.<p>8) Provide interfaces for future system growth and improvement.<p>You can see that there are a vast array of data interfaces that must be managed with all kinds of operational and time constraints.

Obviously it might increase pilot effectiveness, and decrease the amount of stuff pilots have to learn.<p>* I also read that the f35 has been designed around many sensor systems, allowing it to see enemy aircrafts much more before they would, giving it more time to react or to avoid dog fights: that&#x27;s the argument against a non maneuverable aircraft, that information is more important in a fight situation. Also stealth is not always about land radars, it&#x27;s maybe also about embedded aircraft radars, which are much less capable.<p>* The only point of VTOL is because air bases are hard to come by and build. It requires a large strip of road to take off, and flat areas are hard to defend. VTOL allows a jet to land in remote areas.<p>Maybe the F35 is all about electronic, detection and spying and not about dog fights, maybe the military also doesn&#x27;t want to talk about the functionalities that make a difference so that other countries don&#x27;t pick up on it.

The whole market might be 50-100mil/year and as pg said there&#x27;s no exit strategy for something that small.  It&#x27;s hindered by a perceived lack of impact and various scientific problems yet to be solved.  There&#x27;s also a disconnect between data held proprietary by the customers vs. commercial and academic developers and researchers.<p>And bioinformatics is (or at least was) different in that there were good, open-source alternatives which made it financially impossible to to sustain a commercial effort. There are players but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve done better than molecular modeling.

8824305,comment,8823487,8824214,0,0,jacquesm,,,"There is a lot of common ground between religion and science, both attempt to explain and both originate from man. Religion goes one step further than science and sees itself as an end-run around all requirements for evidence by being &#x27;self evident&#x27; and &#x27;self proving&#x27;. Science sees limits to its power and that alone makes me more comfortable with science.<p>To see Maxwell and contemporaries trotted out to try to prove some point in the present about these men&#x27;s dedication without letting them speak for themselves (they can&#x27;t, they&#x27;re safely dead) is to me just as much a heresy as claiming that Johann S. Bach would have composed all his works if he <i>had</i> been an atheist, rather than that he took a lot of inspiration (if not most of it) from his deeply religious nature.<p>It&#x27;s really not fair to put words in the mouths of men long dead and gone, we can not know of their motivations if they had lived in the present because they didn&#x27;t so all we can do is see that work within context. So I suggest that we just be grateful for the work they did, whatever their motivations were.<p>Keep in mind that priest-natural philosopher was a pre-cursor to our current day scientist and recognize that evolution of thinking is pretty much a given taking into account the march of scientific progress (if we can call it progress, I wished that that was more clear cut but it unfortunately isn&#x27;t always, perhaps in a few thousand years or so we can answer that one with clarity).<p>So, being religious isn&#x27;t a primitive flaw in anybodies mind, great or not.

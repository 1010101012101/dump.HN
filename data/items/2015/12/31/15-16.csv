Word analogies, identifying antonyms, synonyms, and which word isn&#x27;t like the others.<p>The method they use is similar to word2vec. That is, it does statistics on millions of words and how they occur in sentences to try to create a vector representation of it. These vector representations include a lot of semantic information about the words and what they mean, which makes it possible for the computer to do these tests automatically.<p>They then compared it&#x27;s performance on these questions with people they paid on Mechanical Turk. And the computer did better.<p>This is really interesting that it can beat humans, and shows some understanding of the relationships between words. However it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s intelligent, or even close.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t mean IQ tests are worthless. What they measure is variation between humans. People that do better on these questions, also tend to do better on other unrelated exercises. Like puzzles, memory challenges, or even reaction times. That these things are correlated suggests there is some single underlying factor which determines some of the variation of mental ability in humans, and we call that IQ, and can measure it.<p>However computers have a totally different set of factors that determine their strengths and weaknesses, and applying human tests tells us nothing. It doesn&#x27;t tell us that the tests are worthless because dumb computers can pass them, because it still correlates with intelligence <i>in humans</i>. It doesn&#x27;t mean the computer is intelligent, because some of the tests might be beatable with clever algorithms like this, that obviously aren&#x27;t very general.",1451577440

Rejection can be used to generate a Poisson distribution, by enforcing a minimum radius from other points, which has a somewhat similar result to a converged Lloyds algorithm. But you can also sample randomly from the 2d brightness function that is an image. You can also combine those two things to get well spaced points whose density is proportional to brightness, by enforcing a minimum radius that is proportional to brightness. (Or inverse brightness!) And best of all, it&#x27;s ridiculously easy to implement. For an extra good time, you can learn how to importance sample that distribution directly, an alternative to rejection sampling that doesn&#x27;t waste any points.<p>Glad to hear you&#x27;re digging it, I love this kind of stuff!

They learn by trial and error (specifically, Q-learning[2]) and rely only on reading pixels and knowing the current score. They learn fairly sophisticated behaviors and ultimately learn to play these games at levels far superior to what humans can achieve.<p>Many people are now trying to generalize these results to more realistic worlds, such as 3D games.

Outside the large tech-cos, they&#x27;re usually considering joining a startup with a lower salary and some number of options for equity.<p>Our company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a private holding company and does not offer equity ownership. As an alternative to equity options, we have bonus plans based on performance, both annual as well as long-term. We make estimations about overall company performance on a few metrics in order to provide what amounts to a range of values for how those plans apply to a specific candidate&#x27;s role with us.<p>But I get a lot of questions about how to compare an offer from us to an offer from a startup that includes equity options as part of compensation. It&#x27;s simple to compare salary, benefits, etc. But invariably, we get into conversations where candidates ask me how to value equity options they&#x27;ve received from another company.<p>First, I&#x27;m totally upfront about the fact that I&#x27;m: 1) not an expert, and 2) biased. But I am always honest with a candidate, and do everything I can to put myself in the shoes of an advisor.<p>Without looking at any offer details they have, I point them to the equation inputs: # of outstanding shares, preferred percentages, any liquidation preferences in play (need the multiple too), and the valuation. I&#x27;m sure there are other data points that could apply, but this information seems like table stakes. Nonetheless, if they have this information, they could at least gauge the value of their own equity options with exit scenarios at different levels.<p>But converting those scenarios to present-day value? This is the part where I always check myself, but I express that those equity options are almost certainly zero value. The outcome of a significant positive exit is always an outlier on the distribution curve, so appropriate discounting applies. That&#x27;s the math part, which is as good as your assumptions and estimates allow.<p>The hardest part of those conversations is understanding how to justify assumptions in those calculations, such as how high profile a startup may be (and how that affects those assumptions.) I&#x27;ve been around long enough to have friends who were employees with numbers less than 30 at some very high-profile startups who had significant public exits, yet those employees made little to nothing. And to say nothing of those companies that simply didn&#x27;t make it.<p>As creatives, our natural instincts drive us to believe we can create the value necessary for us to derive positive outcomes and ultimately benefit in these situations. The historical numbers simply don&#x27;t represent that fact, and indeed show that outcome to be a rare occurrence. Good on you if that happens, but the odds are simply not in your favor.<p>As I conclude with most candidates, I tell them their mileage may vary and that they should absolutely seek the advice of someone entirely independent. Maybe as luck would have it, we have had a few candidates join us that were strongly leaning to accepting their startup offer. Several told me their reasoning -- they trusted my honesty with them. Who knows, maybe that&#x27;s the <i>real value</i> in equity options. :-)",1451576232

10817858,comment,10811906,10816903,0,0,mpdehaan2,,,"Issuing 10,000 options and not telling you how many options are outstanding is very very common for startups, unfortunately.  I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve joined companies that listed 10,000 options and I was too dumb to question it.<p>In many cases, it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t want non-executive employees to be able to know certain financial details, including the valuation of the company.  I wish this wasn&#x27;t the case, but the reasons for it seem logical and in fact fair - it&#x27;s just that many people assume this is a lot when it probably isn&#x27;t.<p>The downside is many people are apt to accept, thinking 10,000 in options is a &quot;lot&quot;, and I&#x27;ve made that mistake in the past.  In an A round startup, this number could easily be in the several millions of shares outstanding, and likely is.  If it&#x27;s gone through several funding rounds, it&#x27;s likely even less.  10,000 in a C round is significantly less if they have divided the stock by 10x or more in the previous rounds.<p>Executives could be pulling in whole percentages of the company, or multiples thereof, and one of the first few members of technical staff could basically be looking at a year&#x27;s salary or less in payout if the company would sell in 5-8 years.<p>The percentage of the companys that make it is also a factor.  While the article focused on needing to stay at a company, it&#x27;s fair to consider that the great majority of startups are going to fail or be very small acquisitions (asset deals, acqui-hiring, etc).  In these positions, the VCs will get paid first, and there may not be much if anything left.<p>Another possibility is the company is sold for small prices but the CEO could secure a very very nice deal to join the new company (plus bonuses), which has happened on more than one occasion.<p>A VC only needs a small fraction of his portfolio to do big exits, so they make lots of bets.<p>Stock is a huge gamble. I don&#x27;t recommend &quot;no stock, just cash&quot;, but don&#x27;t ever let someone underpay you on hopes the stock event will happen.<p>Stock is being used as a retention tool, and that&#x27;s the design of it, unfortunately.<p>I&#x27;d be much more in favor of equitable profit sharing as a retention tool - suppose a company decides to give away X% of it&#x27;s profits back to employees forever, and this is done in a way where it isn&#x27;t the CEO/leaders making all the money.  Instead say in a 50 person company, 10% of the profits always go back to the people, and each person gets 1/50th.<p>This also eliminates sales commission on large deals and makes everyone part of the deal (the whole company) profits - also no quarterly targets, personal bonus tiers, executive bonuses, or anything like that.\nAs the company becomes more efficient, those numbers go up, and it keeps things simple.",1451575018

GHC project, like pyramids, is a way to get living for so many people and organizations in the first place.<p>There is still no consensus among philosophers and, of course, no empirical evidence of existence of time as a phenomena of the Universe, apart from mental concept which could be derived from this or that physical processes using mathematical modeling. But for math models being proven does not imply existence. There are phenomena we call &quot;mass&quot;, and hence phenomena we call forces, there is notion of distance, succession, rate of change, but there is no phenomena of time apart from some physical process observable by a mind. The famous clocks being accelerated is mere a mental construct.<p>How come that we are so convinced that time exist? Well, suppose you have arrived to some big Tibetan Monastery in Lhasa or Shigatse at the beginning of the last century. You will be overwhelmed by the architecture, paintings, buzzing activities, which all seemingly makes perfect sense for those who performs them. All the rituals, offerings, recitation of scriptures, daily duties, strict hierarchy, etc. Much like MIT nowadays.)<p>Unless you are questioning everything, trying to reduce everything back to first principles, being skeptical and aware of socially constructed dogmas, you will be convinced very quickly that there are various buddhas and other deities which appear and disappear upon their will, that they hide some scriptures in the past, to be revealed when humanity will be ready for the knowledge. You will study cosmology, reasoning, philosophy of emptiness, as a refinement of crude ancient Indian philosophy (which is the only real marvel Tibetan culture produced) and so on. If you are good student you will become very good rimpoche, expert in all the subtle details of the teachings. I am seasonal guide in Tibet, so I know what I am talking about.)<p>What do we call notions held firmly by society but which cannot be empirically proven? We call it beliefs. How do we call organized beliefs, supported by social institutions? We call it a religion. Modern quantum physics is nothing but a bunch of religious sects.<p>BTW, traditional Indian philosophy, which goes back to Upanishads, put the human mind in the center, so it could observe itself, how easily and readily it produces chimeras and dogmas. The two almost unbreakable of these is &quot;myself&quot; and &quot;time&quot;. Upanishads were the very first systematic discourses which attempted to prove logically non-existence of these mental concepts. Still, no one managed to refute Upanishads. &quot;A priori&quot; established by Kant is related to that mind - an observer, not to the observed Universe.",1451574129

And there is nothing that ties that entity to a particular country, especially when the expenses aren&#x27;t actually all in the same place.

Hey, those articles on exclusion, inclusion, and the ideas of citizenship from antiquity to today sound really interesting. Wow, a Princeton classicist doing something I can understand! I&#x27;m going to look at buying his book, this guy is rad. (Halfway through morning coffee, so excuse the shallowness of the thoughts.)<p>I read this OP and started rolling my eyes again. Right, right, kids these days, telling kids to think about their Halloween costumes is so PC (telling kids to think! can&#x27;t have that! wait, next paragraph he wants kids to think, just about something else). As I continued to read, I realized why we have such different experiences in part: I teach math. I can see that my students <i>did</i> learn something this semester. Now most of them can discuss geometric Brownian motion. That&#x27;s cool. As the author here says,<p><i>Many of the engineers who were painted purple during frosh  \nweek are now running the institutions where we teach. And they weren’t kidding when they were pissing on our guitars in the quad. It was a promissory note on the future — a future they could feel in their bones belonged to them, not us.</i><p>I&#x27;m one of <i>them</i> -- the heathen, uneducated STEM people! If I call his thoughts about Camus &quot;fluff&quot; he no longer has any defense! Needing to be polite in his response renders him... gosh, impotent? in the face of such trenchant criticism. Hm.<p>Things are different on the STEM side of campus than the classics side. Many on that side say that they&#x27;re terrified of their students (<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8706323/college-professor-afraid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8706323/college-professor-afraid</a>) but it seems to me that these folks are terrified of discussion -- and the other thing to note is that every single one of them brings up the fear of <i>losing their job</i> over a discussion. It&#x27;s curious, in one of the only professions in the world with tenure. Why are all these guys afraid of losing their job for challenging the PC SJW orthodoxy or whatever? For professors with tenure, this is a fear entirely unsupported by statistics. The only case even marginally close is when Salaita had a job offer withdrawn because of his views on Israel and Palestine, and I think he was on what would be stereotyped as the PC side at the moment. So, tenure gives golden handcuffs -- you can&#x27;t move institutions -- but you&#x27;ll still have your job even if you&#x27;re a grump.<p>Ok, so why are these profs on the liberal arts side scared? Because of the adjunctivization of higher ed -- no tenure for most (including me). One great discussion here: <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/5/8736591/liberal-professor-identity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vox.com/2015/6/5/8736591/liberal-professor-identi...</a>\n Because of the corporatization of higher ed: more discussion here.  <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/life/education/2015/05/college_students_are_not_customers_a_political_shorthand_that_needs_to_die.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/life/education/2015/05/college...</a> Because the STEM and business profs are &quot;winning,&quot; as the OP said. Because he can&#x27;t see his own relevance anymore, unlike Dan-el Padilla Peralta. Because he can&#x27;t connect with his students anymore.<p>It&#x27;s hilarious that these problems are so acutely felt when more American kids than ever feel required to go to college. The audience is bigger than ever. That means the message can&#x27;t be as niche, but this is still an opportunity. Hate online education? Why, and what are you going to do about it? Hate telling students they should be thoughtful when considering cultural appropriation? Have the cojones to join the discussion in a more substantive way than &quot;overcoddled kids these days!&quot;",1451574057

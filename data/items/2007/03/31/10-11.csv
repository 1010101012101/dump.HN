7803,comment,7684,7684,0,0,Tichy,,,"Absolutely ridiculous test. There weren't even any books in it, for example, yet they claim to be able to tell if I am into reading books or not? Sorry, but I don't believe their tests are scientifically sound. The sheer number of traits they claim to identify - almost as many traits as there were ""questions"", I don't think it can work. <p>Why don't you just use a classic IQ test if you are into that kind of stuff, or the Myer-Briggs test?\n",1175336538

There's been a campaign to get more faculty to submit ""invention disclosures"" to the tech transfer office  but I'm not sure how aggressively the university would litigate if a faculty member just didn't submit their research and proceeded to commercialization themselves.<p>However, the policy is less draconian when you realize that the revenue split only applies to patent licensing revenue. A professor's start up company would not have to pay licensing fees to the university. It really only makes sense for biotech because there is almost no money in licensing new software patents.<p>Perhaps more interesting is that Pitt's tech transfer is run at a net loss -- the vice provost said recently that they are just now breaking even which means they are probably still losing money.",1175335609

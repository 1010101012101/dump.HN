7931651,comment,7930500,7931385,3,0,Tyrannosaurs,,,"> All in all, this war is moot. Moore&#x27;s law applied to bandwith, to device computation speed and to software evolution leads to this: <a href=""http://xkcd.com/1367/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/1367/</a><p>Not really.<p>If you have massively powerful devices and massively fast connections then you move to a situation where you&#x27;ve still got to address differences between the programming models and and the feature sets on the various devices.<p>For a web app to have parity with a native app there are still significant technology gaps which need to be closed - offline working (moving in the right direction, still not great), native look, feel and functionality (difficult if you want it to run on multiple device types) and so on. Some of those will close over time, some may not.<p>But harder to close off - I struggle to see how cross platform will every be much more than lowest common denominator given the consensus required on how to adopt new features as they arrive on phones. Apple launches TouchID, Samsung launch fingerprint scanning. How long before the W3C define a standard for that and the companies adopt it? How much time is that where native developers are at an advantage?<p>The web is great and web apps will definitely be a bigger part of things going forward, but I think it&#x27;s simplistic to assume that they&#x27;ll take over.<p>As for a present day Microsoft, I don&#x27;t see that happening. Back then interoperability was a nightmare - if the person I wanted to work with wasn&#x27;t running the same OS as me I was basically screwed. Right now I can collaborate with someone and generally speaking I don&#x27;t care what they&#x27;re running and it really doesn&#x27;t matter.",1403528301

Anything at all? That was my question. The claim is that you should hire people you know nothing about rather than people you know something about.

Last year they announced they would switch to using Blink instead of their own rendering engine.<p>The engine switch came with a complete rewrite of their browser as far as I understand it, so they prioritized Windows/OSX stability for a year and now finally came up with a Linux build again. The big gap in version numbers is due to their new browser starting at 15 + the adoption of a much shorter release cycle.<p>Once Linux builds are made stable I expect they will continue to release builds on all 3 platforms as they were doing for the many years before this slightly extreme shift.",1403528125

There are of course bike trailers for hauling 2-3 children around and don&#x27;t forget pedicabs which regularly haul around 3-4 adults.<p>After you get used to it you don&#x27;t really feel exhausted. Yes commuting 20 miles by bike is definitely an upper limit, at least for me, but I do know people with longer bike commutes.<p>So assuming you fuel yourself with pure beef, the most unsustainable food I could find, you&#x27;d need about .85 kg to get 2000 calories. On average the production of beef releases about 13.3 kg of CO2 per kg of beef, so we&#x27;re looking at 11.305 kg of CO2 per commute. The average CO2 produced for a medium sized car is about .5 kg per mile. So for the same 40 mile commute you&#x27;re looking at around 20 kg of emissions. So even if you choose to only eat the most unsustainable food it&#x27;s still better than driving. If you switch to pork or poultry you can reduce that 11.305 kg of CO2 by about 75%.

You travel a lot. How do you both develop your business, and travel?<p>A: I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time worrying about this too. But then I noticed, that if I&#x27;m away from the office for some reason, work doesn&#x27;t suddenly stop. And so I started traveling. There are no more colleagues, who are unable to work without my supervision. Everyone knows, it doesn&#x27;t matter where I am, because work goes on. My advice is - build your life to your comfort. Others will accept it as a fact. If not the current ones, then the new employees will. And it&#x27;s important to keep working. Distance is not relevant, but presence is. Coordinating projects is presence.&quot;<p>I took away that employees know what to do. Being present via project coordination, and being chained to your office chair are not the same thing.

Longer answer: sort-of, but not recently.<p>In the mid-20th century, there was a lot of suicide in northern latitudes in the summer, which actually led some to believe that <i>too much</i> light (16-20+ hours per day) was the culprit. Spring and summer have always been the peak seasons for suicide, violent crime, and new mental illness. So why is there less of that in warmer climates? The culprit isn&#x27;t sunlight (either winter&#x27;s lack of it, or summer&#x27;s abundance of it) itself, but alcoholism (which is a contributing factor to a shocking percentage of suicides). Harsh winter climates can contribute to alcoholism-- however, a lack of economic opportunity is more devastating-- which is a chronic problem once developed, and can lead to a summer suicide.<p>In 2014, the Nordic countries take alcoholism, mental health, and social services very seriously (much moreso than, say, the US) and don&#x27;t have an unusually high suicide rate. In fact, people in Scandinavia and Canada are, on average, happier, healthier, and less suicidal than Americans.",1403525767

And you'd be well served to cook up some subtemplates/helpers/whatever that automated away some of the drudgery.  Pretty soon you'd have more ideas on how to keep your CSS more maintainable, your subtemplates would become more general, etc.<p>At this point you have implemented most of Sass/Less/etc but you have a bunch of templating gunk, less documentation, and hundreds fewer eyeballs looking at the code.  Or, you have not implemented most of Sass/Less/etc and you are still writing CSS like a chump.",1272819581

1312732,story,,,2,7,PCONerd,"Ask HN: Single loyalty card?",,"Been thinking about an idea for awhile and want to see what people think.<p>It seems that every company has their own value/club card of some sort. Be it Safeway, Subway, Best Buy or one of the other thousands out there. For the end user, this is a major pain in the ass. There is no way to carry everyone's card with you all the time. Because of this, I just stop taking new cards and it's really a loss to me but I can't fit them all in my wallet (or better yet, I don't need a 8th Subway value card).<p>Now to me, this is an easy problem to solve. Instead of every company having their own card, why not accept a single network card? One card to rule them all. It's not a magical idea, one central database that contains std. user information and a unique id that other networks can tap into to retrieve data. With a simple system, you could reduce the number of value cards down to one card. Making it much easier for end users as well as increase user participation.<p>Ok, so one other value a system like this could offer is the ability for smaller mom and pop stores to create their own value card system without having to shell out a lot of money. Using a simple application and DB, they could start offering rewards to customers that buy say the 15 plant from the local nursery and get one free.<p>Anyway, that's my idea. It just seems odd that with today’s technology we can’t do something better than fitting yet another card into our wallets. Let me know what you think.",1272819439

TV shows provide excellent content because millions of people watch these shows everyday.<p>We can even imagine why TV memes might be funnier.  When you see a meme based on your favorite show, it is funnier because you have three seasons worth of character development.<p>My personal favs:

1312658,comment,1311884,1312592,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Well in China, that may actually be the case, the government seem to be positioning themselves to compulsory purchase the patents if they can't be amicably licensed or worked around.<p>But what I was proposing more moderate, that the governments only adopt ""Open Standards"" as they are known. If there's a patent identified then either the owner gives it up freely, or it is worked around.<p>This is the exact analogue to current systems where those involved in the standardization agree to RAND fees or the patent is worked around. This does nothing to prevent other patent holders fouling things up, but that's true of the current system too.<p>To make this work well you'd probably need a patent estoppel system where it is the responsibility of the patent owner to identify standards that infringe their patents rather than the other way round. If they fail to notify in time, then they'd lose the patent or at the very least the right to profit from the network effect of the standard (see this paper for details <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1134000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1134000</a>). But it can work without that extra legal support and there's plenty of Open Standards to prove it.",1272817098

This is the going strategy today in the Valley and many of our startups use it.<p>The issue in dealing with the VCs is primarily a psychological one and I would say that, other than in an extremely down investment environment, most would be willing to let go on something like 2x if the market as a whole for VC investments is not supporting it (the long-term norm is 1x - during the dot-bomb phase, it was more like 3x-5x - today it is somewhere in between). So, yes, I think the issue can normally be argued, and argued successfully, especially if the startup is positioned well and can be selective.<p>The terms for participation with a cap will vary widely but, in essence, do not come out much differently in practical terms than would a 2x/non-participating type of preference.",1272816393

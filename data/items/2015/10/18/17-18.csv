You are inferring with your comment that dissenting from mainstream opinion should be allowed to have the equivalent social consequences of e.g. advocating genocide. But with that line of reasoning you are allowing people with unpopular opinions to argued by the character of the people making them.",1445191182

I&#x27;m not saying that the original comment is for sure 100% wrong.<p>> <i>Seems like we have only a very feeble understanding of the brain.</i><p>Yes and no. Our understanding is very selective; we definitely lack the details on everything, but we know the general picture and details of some parts - which lets us have some confidence about how the thing works. We know for instance that if brain is in fact just an antenna, it&#x27;s not for anything that goes over EM spectrum, and most likely neither by any particle known to us. Otherwise we&#x27;d have figured it out already by accident - people would drop dead underground or close to (shielded) nuclear reactors.

Decentralized user/password auth for 100M users would require a few GB of storage. Then you&#x27;d need a way to verify that info. Not impossible, but see how heavy e.g. the Bitcoin block chain is. The real obvious tell is that Skype had password reset via email, so obviously they&#x27;ve always had a &quot;backdoor&quot;.<p>On top of that, the client was heavily obfuscated, so it&#x27;s unlikely anyone besides the developers actually knew what it did in every situation. (Skype client did stuff like generate executable (.com) files on the fly to check things - they really didn&#x27;t want the protocol reverse engineered.)<p>Skype allowed LE in well before Microsoft. And how would that even be noticed? Your system would relay through &quot;random&quot; peers and you had no way to verify the selection, and since the protocol is unknown, you have no way to verify the packets transmitted. The client could easily divert your call via a special interception node and you&#x27;d have no idea.<p>Skype <i>could</i> have easily implemented proper E2E crypto with a simple audio verification step (ala PGPFone and now ZRTP.) They chose (and continue to choose) not to. They could then publish the spec so users could verify; they choose not to.<p>What you&#x27;re probably thinking of is MS&#x27;s decision to nix the P2P part of the Skype client which imposed undue resource usage on clients. Now MS runs the &quot;peers&quot; needed to maintain the network. This is the least concerning part of Skype, but looks the most sinister to a casual glance.",1445191081

My statements on this were wrong.<p>The general principle I stated is the one employed in the U.S.  Generally, when one receives money there are tax implications. There are some exceptions to this principle but this is the general idea.  The different ways of receiving money have different tax rates and this causes a skewing of how &quot;income&quot; is begotten in the U.S. by the very wealthy. They prefer getting money via capital gains since the tax is less that route.<p>I don&#x27;t think one can reasonably argue that not taxing one form of income would lead to people preferring to get income via that tax free route.  The objection I had to your original post is that the U.S. tax principle is bad.  It is reasonable to tax all income streams.

If they apply also to primates, are lions hunting and killing primates - not sure if they actually do - violating basic primate rights? How do you come to know about your fundamental rights? Could you still come up with the same ideas if you were the only human on earth?<p>And more specifically, if reproduction is a fundamental right, can you rape other humans in case no one voluntarily wants to reproduce with you? You probably don&#x27;t think that, so you are not really arguing for an ultimate right to reproduce but the right to do so with consent. This again raises the question of incest. Why can we outlaw incest when you have a fundamental right to reproduce. Because bad things are likely to happen to possible offspring? But so does reproduction leading to overpopulation just not in such a direct way.<p>Absolute rights and a right to reproduce in particular are - at least in my opinion - hard to defend positions.

I don&#x27;t think there should be social consequences for saying something that isn&#x27;t PC. And I think OP falls into the same category. This is far from something so general as &quot;consequences for speech&quot; which would include things as abstract as judging the level of education of the speaker. I don&#x27;t make this point lightly either. It is a phenomenon I&#x27;ve observed too many times in my life. There are people that are actually willing to listen to others, that actually try to get the context of who this person is that they&#x27;re speaking with. But most people are not willing to listen to someone else within the context of who that person is, and are more than willing to run with their early assumptions of that person. Why is it that the people who are oversensitive always fall into the latter category? Being sensitive to political correctness is a way of being ignorant and pretentious to the world, to the billions of people who are not like yourself.<p>Big Think - People Will Misjudge You Unless You Manipulate Them:\n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX83nf6t6Vg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX83nf6t6Vg</a>",1445187811

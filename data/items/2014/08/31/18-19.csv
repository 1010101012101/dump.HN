We can flip the example around and produce an example that demonstrates one of the criticisms of the Bayesian tools.<p>&quot;Suppose there are two villages, Frequentistburg and Bayesianville, harvesting berries grown in a field between them. There are two types of berries: edible and poisonous. Suppose 86% of berries in the field are edible and float in water, 9% are edible and sink in water, 4% are poisonous and float, and 1% are poisonous and sink. Both towns are interested in devising a decision rule where a citizen measures some property of the berry (let&#x27;s say we look at whether it floats or sinks) and the procedure should let them decide whether they can eat that berry with at least 80% certainty that it is edible.<p>&quot;In Bayesianville, the town leaders announce this procedure in the newspaper: &#x27;Take the berry out of the wrapper and see if it floats in water. Given this observation, calculate the posterior probability that the berry is edible, and if that number is more than 80%, eat away. If everybody follows this procedure, on average only 20% of our town will get poisoned by their morning berry.&#x27; Is this a good decision rule for the town? Not really. In practice, the town&#x27;s citizens will end up eating ALL berries. (p(edible|floats) = 86 / (86 + 4) = 95.6% and p(edible|sinks) = 9 / (9 + 1) = 90%). The town&#x27;s faraway enemy subscribes to their newspaper, learns the decision rule, and exploits a vulnerability: they rearrange the berry crops on the field so that the berries closest to the Bayesianville harvesters are all the poisonous crops. The next day, 100% of the citizens will do the experiment, 100% of the citizens will conclude that they have a <= 10% chance of getting poisoned by their morning berry, 100% of the citizens will eat that berry, and 100% of the citizens will get poisoned by it.<p>&quot;In Frequentistburg, the town leaders announce a different procedure in the newspaper: &#x27;We have devised a hypothesis test to reject the hypothesis that your morning berry is poisonous. If the berry sinks, then with p = 0.2, you can reject the hypothesis that the berry is poisonous. If the berry floats, then with p = 0.8, you can reject the hypothesis that the berry is poisonous.&#x27; A citizen who uses a tolerance for false positive (mistaken eating) of alpha=20% will end up eating the berry if and only if it sinks. The Bayesianvillagers regard this behavior as bizarre: it&#x27;s the <i>floating</i> berries that have a higher posterior probability of being edible! But in this procedure, because of the minimax criterion, there is no similar vulnerability that be exploited by an enemy town -- the procedure will preserve 80% of the citizenry even if all of their morning berries are somehow manipulated to be the poisonous kind. (Of course, the procedure also ends up discarding 90% of the berries.)<p>Frequentistburg sees all of Bayesianville&#x27;s citizens get poisoned by a bad harvest and replies to your critique: &quot;<i>BOTH</i> towns are caring about &#x27;things that did not happen.&#x27; Here in Frequentistburg, we constructed our hypothesis test by caring about <i>observations</i> (e.g. float/sink) that did not happen. Your citizens in Bayesianville calculated their posterior by doing a weighted average over <i>values of the parameter</i> (e.g. edible/inedible) that did not happen.&quot;<p>Moved by the painful experience, the neighboring towns met for a joint summit in a neutral location and explained their desiderata to each other in terms of the common language of decision theory and then they all lived happily ever after.<p>(In my first link above, I show the same basic problems using a uniform prior among four options.)",1409510977

(Newer designs don&#x27;t even require that, which is certainly an improvement; but that doesn&#x27;t mean we should misrepresent the features of older designs.) But they do <i>not</i> require operators to take certain actions in the event of failure to prevent radiation release to the outside world. They just require backup power.

Even if we grant that Fukushima has harmed many people, the main reasons for that harm were unrelated to the reactor itself: they were the bad siting of the backup power, and the fact that TEPCO and the Japanese government refused to admit what was really going on and take proper steps to contain it, including asking for help. The same sorts of human errors have caused much more harm in connection with other technologies--for example, consider the people harmed due to coal mining (several orders of magnitude more than those harmed due to nuclear energy).<p><i>> There&#x27;s always a way to imagine a failure scenario that is possible, even if unlikely.</i><p>Sure, and this is true of <i>any</i> technology.

Which is to say that researchers work backwards from the very complex end state of a disease, attempting to produce a treatment from each new proximate cause they uncover. These treatments largely involve attempts to manipulate a very complex and poorly understood state of metabolism / biology. Only a very, very tiny slice of all this research funding goes towards prevention or repair or other ways to address the root causes of these diseases of aging, which is to say the processes aging itself. Until this changes, progress is only very loosely coupled to levels of funding. You can spend a bunch of money paying people to drain a lake with spoons, or you could spend a lot less doing something better and more effective, and that&#x27;s really a fair analogy for where medical research is with respect to the diseases of aging.

If you have a 5+ mile commute, it&#x27;s going to be way worse than the same distance in most US cities, because of the traffic. But the flip side is that there is far more density to the LA suburbs than most anywhere else in the country—it&#x27;s hard to even use the same word to describe suburban LA (7K/sqmile average for the whole urbanized area per Wikipedia, with parts significantly higher) as, say, suburban DFW, where the population density is half that for Dallas proper alone, let alone all the suburbs.<p>So if you live near where you work, you can bike or walk or bus and there&#x27;s a decent chance you&#x27;ll be in walking or biking  distance of some shops and restaurants as well. And then the occasional Uber or cab for longer trips (or just bumming off of friends who have cars) is extremely practical.<p>But if you don&#x27;t telecommute, being able to live near where you work is something that&#x27;s a lot easier for those without a family. And then those Ubers would add up fast!<p>(The other thing I&#x27;ve anecdotally noticed since moving to LA, is that the willingness to sit in traffic for an hour each way to commute seems way higher in LA natives than in transplants—and the reverse is true of the willingness to pay the premium to live close to work and avoid that.)",1409510508

I live in Montreal and regularly use <a href=""http://communauto.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://communauto.com/</a> They have two services, 1) for ~$2,50/hour + $0,10/km, where you need to make a reservation, you get the car from one specific parking lot and have to return it there. It&#x27;s useful only if you plan in advance, if you haven&#x27;t reserved a car for the weekend by Wednesday forget about it.<p>The 2) service though you just swipe your metro card on the panel for an auto-mobile car parked somewhere, drive for $0,30/minute and leave the car anywhere (in some very big zones in the cities). It&#x27;s exactly like <a href=""https://www.car2go.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.car2go.com/</a> except their auto-mobile vehicles (hybrids and electrics) have backseat, so we can go around with kids (whereas you can&#x27;t with a Smart).<p>I commute by bicycle to work, so we use this only on the weekends.

No stdout/stdin, no fork, no exec, no file and file system access, no threads, no sockets - and if you get some of this it&#x27;s via an embedding app, not standard means. It&#x27;s hard to work in such an environment because it&#x27;s very rare for app developers to provide you with all the standard tools you have when developing standalone program. One of the most painful experiences I had with such env was with Google Refine - now Open Refine - which allowed scripting in Python (via Jython) and Clojure, but only really supported executing single statements in a tiny textbox, without any real error reporting and without access to anything external (like to files).

8249905,comment,8248609,8248775,3,0,bjterry,,,"Everything that you&#x27;ve written is technically correct. But it seems like in the large majority of situations where people are using/publishing statistics, the expected value is what we care about but we are using frequentist methods. So if we are going to correct the &quot;norm we use to choose our optimal procedure,&quot; it should imply a many-fold increase in uses of Bayesian methods. A huge amount of published papers that include any statistics are reporting means and p-values in very simple statistical analyses (essentially all papers published in the social sciences, health sciences, etc.). In many of these situations researchers could provide subjective priors based on the state of the research and knowledge beforehand and it would be philosophically valid and beneficial.<p>Because of this mismatch, people who support Bayesian methods perhaps overstate their case. Maybe this is for the same reason that partisan political actors argue fervently for a single side of an issue, ignoring nuance. Nuance historically has not led to social change, and fixing statistics in science requires changing people&#x27;s minds and &quot;raising awareness.&quot;",1409508639

(As an aside, do you rule out the Cauchy distribution in your axiomatic approach?). We don&#x27;t have rock solid theorems that the average is of any interest. If we&#x27;re interested in knowing whether a dam is likely to overflow based on historical water levels, the average is of limited use -- for heights well below the highest historical depth, an average will be something that we can at least calculate, but not precisely. If we want to leave room for error (build a dam above the highest historical waterlevel, and do it conservatively so that we&#x27;ll be above future maixima for the next x years w/ some probability), we can&#x27;t even calculate an average.<p>Now what? That&#x27;s what I mean by &quot;naive.&quot; If we&#x27;re going to try to attack problems that aren&#x27;t transparently easy (something like stationary weakly-dependent data with finite moments, enough observations that not only the CLT is a good approximation, but that we don&#x27;t even need to worry about efficiency, loosely defined) then we need to start thinking about the properties we want our estimation procedure to have.<p>One set of properties leads to something like frequentist statistics, another set of properties leads to Bayesian statistics.

It has the cutting edge lithography standards, the kinks in that manufacturing process are still getting worked out (wastage), they are still paying off the initial R&D investment, they are actively marketing & selling it, and it&#x27;s paying for future R&D investment. I can get a nearly equivalent (roughly speaking) Celeron for $40 from the same site, and I didn&#x27;t even price out ARM/generic fab cpus. The Celeron price (or more accurately, the average price of that Celeron over time) is much more indicative of the true energy input costs of the underlying technology at scale.<p>A manufactured product has a virtuous cycle (from a consumer perspective, at least) of high upfront cost for development dropping as less marginal R&D is required, at the same time as the production process gets further optimized/automated and economies of scale kick in.<p>Solar is still definitely in the early stages of adoption based on growth curves, and prices reflect a huge amount of non-energy input costs that are not truly representative of the EROEI that will be present when it represents 10, 20, or +50% of total energy production.<p>There are certain physical properties of PV cells that prevent efficiencies of +35% or so in standard   unconcentrated single-junction pv cells. Because silicon is so ubiquitous, I suspect that we&#x27;re already hitting points of diminishing returns in research/cell efficiency and production/process optimizations are going to start dominating until product optimizations are necessary to increase density. Right now, the biggest cost I&#x27;m aware of is silicon wasteage, which is the driver behind thin-film tech or alternative geometries (eg Solyndra) - I have heard of research into vapor deposition approaches that could greatly limit this. Hypothetically, if that works at scale, I can&#x27;t really see a mass-produced 250w panel costing more than $50 (could be even lower assuming a market/industry for refined Si recycling from old/damaged panels).<p>Same thing would eventually go for concentrated multijunction modules that can hit +80% efficiencies, eventually, assuming that the non-Si junctions don&#x27;t have material constraints (like HRE elements).<p>Now, I&#x27;ve gone on too long already, but let me say I&#x27;m not de facto anti-nuclear. I think light water reactor design is terrifying and I think existing waste storage policy is basically sticking fingers in ears and yelling &#x27;LALALALA&#x27;. In order not to end the world with a climate catastrophe, I think it will be a bridge fuel and hopefully novel reactor design tech (eg CANDU) can help there.<p>However, the future is solar and wind power supplanting coal and nuclear, bio-petroleum from algal/renewable-electric input supplanting necessary high density applications (oil), and biomass methane supplanting NG for intermediate applications like peaking plant generation.<p>edit: Evidence of this happening already: <a href=""http://www.seia.org/policy/environment/pv-recycling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seia.org/policy/environment/pv-recycling</a> ... you&#x27;ve accurately noted that there are substantial subsidies, but they exist to accelerate the maturation of this source of energy.

Here's how you establish a price for commercial use: you talk to the author and you ask him if he'd consider giving you a commercial license, the you discuss the price.<p>> I don't know how something can be orthogonal when it correlates strongly.<p>Because it only correlates due to medium and publication costs.<p>> The point which I had trouble explaining above was that there also some for-profit uses in this category which NC-using bands would not mind, like ad-supported bloggers.<p>Or so you believe, that doesn't actually mean it's the case. Furthermore, and as I noted above, this is a non-issue: the ad-supported blogger can send a request to the author and get a license directly.<p>> In that sense, my impression of those who select NC is that they really just want to embrace the newer ways that people interact with music, without allowing the older modes of interaction to exploit it.<p>That is not my impression at all.",1347044100

4490599,comment,4488869,4490359,5,0,tmhedberg,,,"I suppose that, in my personal experience, I just haven't written a lot of Haskell code that used multiple similar record types in the same namespace.<p>I don't have any evidence for this, but I feel like it's often a bit of a code smell when this problem crops up. It seems like it frequently happens when programmers used to OOP are trying to shoehorn an object oriented design into a language which is just fundamentally <i>not</i> object oriented. I'm not saying that that's the <i>only</i> situation in which this problem arises, nor that the complaint isn't a legitimate one, regardless. There is no question that the situation could be improved. And perhaps I've just gotten lucky so far and haven't come across a scenario in which this really causes difficulties.<p>That said, there are always ways to work around the issue. I will make no claims of elegance here, but it's really not <i>that</i> much trouble. For one, you can define the different record types in separate modules, and then import them qualified. That's easy enough to do; it's just annoying to have to use multiple files.<p>Alternatively, you can keep the ugly prefixes on the record field names, but then use a type class to elide them away everywhere you refer to them. This technique only works when the similarly-named fields have the same type in each record, unless you use fundeps or associated types to attach additional type information to your class. For example:<p><pre><code>    {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}

    data Foo = Foo {foo_field1 :: Char, foo_field2 :: String}
    data Bar = Bar {bar_field1 :: Int, bar_field2 :: String}
    
    class MyRecord a where type Field1Type a
                           field1 :: a -> Field1Type a
                           field2 :: a -> String

    instance MyRecord Foo where type Field1Type Foo = Char
                                field1 = foo_field1
                                field2 = foo_field2

    instance MyRecord Bar where type Field1Type Bar = Int
                                field1 = bar_field1
                                field2 = bar_field2
</code></pre>
You could even use Template Haskell to automatically generate the instances so you don't have to tediously type them out yourself, especially handy for records with a large number of fields.<p>So I'm not claiming that there's no problem to be solved. I would be happy to see a real solution to this that doesn't require any workarounds. I just don't think it's a big enough issue to keep me from using a language which is, in nearly all other respects, awesome. :)",1347044009

Here are some counterargument to some of your points.<p>It has been years since Jimmy owned or controlled Wikipedia. Sure, the existence of a non-profit board with elections is no guarantee Wikipedia won't go bad, but I think you overestimate the usefulness of the CC license to those who would try to fork it if it does go (""has gone""?) bad.<p>>LibreOffice stands out as an example<p>Like I said although I strongly support open-source licenses for CODE (precisely because they allow forking).  But I don't think the experience with code is particularly informative about text (or ""prose"" if you want a more precise word).<p>If Wikipedia's text were not freely redistributable, there'd be other ways of ""forking"" it (or more precisely, competing with it for the attention of the world's readers) besides rewriting from scratch. One can for example distribute a browser extension that replaces references to Wikipedia pages with pages from the ""fork"" if and only if a page in the ""fork"" exists.<p>My strongest counterargument is that the CC experiment and the Wikipedia experiment have been going on for at least 10 years now, and in the domain of their application to textual (or ""prose"") works, the most compelling actual development you can point to in support of them is Conservapedia (which, even if you approve of their mission, does not get enough traffic to count as a significant effect either good or bad).<p>In contrast, I can point to continuous harm (namely SEO spammers and just plain lazy folks who cannot be bothered to put thoughts in their own words, who are wasting the time of millions of readers).",1347043790

Twitter is just a service that allows people to connect and publicly talk to each other on the Internet. That's it.<p>There have been previous, less successful iterations of the same common idea. Twitter hit critical mass in terms of it's user base and has created neat and unique nuances that make it's version of human-human communication on the web innovative and fun and successful. Kudos to them. It's the social network du jor for fast communication. But there will eventually be other iterations in the future. Some more successful, some less. Perhaps some new incarnations from Twitter itself as they evolve their product over the next decade.<p>If Twitter has a ""mark"", it's that they created a way to ""flatten the world of communication"" and take discussions to a realm where everything and everyone are drawing on the same board at the same time.<p>But in the end, these are all services that facilitate human interactions that have existed for thousands of years. We've just taken those interactions and put them all on an even plane at the same time, and exposed them in a way that is amazingly accessible.<p>So when we talk about ""Twitter changing the world"", I get confused. It's always humans that change the world, we're just using a different vehicle and techniques to get there. So... Rhetorical flourishes and hyperbole aside... How <i>was</i> Twitter changing the world, and how is it <i>not</i> anymore...?",1347043592

The point which I had trouble explaining above was that there also some for-profit uses in this category which NC-using bands would not mind, like ad-supported bloggers.

4490507,comment,4484627,4486905,2,0,chimeracoder,,,"> claiming that Scala doesn't support module-level functions implies to me that you feel this is a deficiency<p>It's not a deficiency, but it emphasizes the fact that Scala is object-oriented, not functional. Scala supports first-class objects, and you get more functional features than Java because, unlike Java functions, Scala functions are objects.<p>In other words, Scala's support for certain functional features is a corollary of its support for first-class objects, <i>not</i> because of its support for first-class functions.<p>> the exact implementation of namespacing (module-level vs module/object-level) is irrelevant to me<p>Which probably means that most of this discussion may be irrelevant to your interests too. :-)<p>That's not meant to be rude - I'm being a bit facetious, but I'll readily admit that the OO 'vs.' FP is far too subtle for most people to care about... and that's fine. Beyond a certain point, it's a discussion with more academic value than practical value.<p>But if you really care, let me try and explain the following:<p>> If module-level functions are important to the question I would like to know why. :)<p>Lack of module-level functions is a hint (though not proof) that Scala is 'OO first, and FP by coincidence'. Objects are just classes that are automatically created and instantiated with a singleton. Scala permits nesting of objects (objects within objects). The nested objects may themselves be function objects or non-function objects. However, at the root, you <i>must</i> have a non-function object.<p>In other words, picture Scala code as a tree: functions may appear as inner nodes or leaf nodes, but they may <i>not</i> be the root node, which is reserved for a <i>non-function</i> object. Inner/leaf nodes are of type<p>psuedocode:<p><pre><code>  type Object

  type ScalaFunction extends Object

  type NonFunctionObject extends Object
</code></pre>
We can have ChildNode[NoneFunctionObject] and ChildNode[ScalaFunction], but we can't have RootNode[ScalaFunction] - we must have RootNode[NonFunctionObject]<p>Furthermore, if Scala functions are implemented as internal methods on variables (which are objects), that means that there is no way in Scala to write a function that is not eventually compiled to a method - ie, an object-bound function. If we can't break this binding, it's hard to make the case that functions are truly first-class. Objects are first-class, and because Scala provides first-class object support (unlike Java), many features of first-class functions can be <i>simulated</i> by using first-class objects, but that's subtly different from treating the function itself as the first-class citizen.<p>For contrast, the inverse would be a functional languages with first-class functions and <i>no</i> first-class objects. All objects are constructed from functions (ie, 'bound to functions' in some sense), and there's no way to create an 'unbound' object, whereas there is in Scala.",1347042682

Without that money, Twitter would be an impossibility. It simply would not exist, at least not at anywhere near the scale it exists at today.<p>My guess is that, for the people who poured in all that money, ""leaving a mark on humanity"" was not the primary reason they opened their wallets. They opened their wallets because <i>they expected to make more money by doing so.</i> They were making <i>investments</i>, not charitable contributions. And at some increasingly near point, those people are going to want to see a return on their investments. That means that, barring an acquisition, Twitter needs to find a way to turn a (hopefully large, from the investors' viewpoint) profit -- and sooner rather than later.<p>Why would you ever have thought things would be otherwise? Twitter is a company. Companies that don't make money usually don't survive. The best case scenario is that they get bought out and operated as a vanity project by a deep-pocketed patron, the way a lot of magazines are. But a magazine is a much smaller and cheaper-to-run enterprise than a centralized, global real-time communications network. Whose pockets are deep enough to run Twitter at a loss indefinitely?<p>If you organize yourself as a for-profit corporation, and take on investors, at some point you have to bring in more money than you burn. Otherwise you <i>will</i> at some point have to scale back your ambitions, because <i>you simply will not be able to afford them anymore.</i><p>Twitter, in other words, is meeting its destiny. Maybe that destiny is not to make as big a ""mark on humanity"" as people wish. But without all the money they took from those investors who are breathing down their necks now, Twitter would never have been able to scale up to where it is today at all. And that money came with the condition that Twitter would at some point figure out a way to pay it back, with interest.<p>That point is now.",1347042545

And I do not see enough benefits to offset that sort of  harm.  In general, it seems to me that it harms readers when readers are subjected to text that has been re-used for some purpose that might differ drastically from the purpose or context of the original author of the text.  I would prefer it if people who did not make the effort to put something in their own words did not even have the ability to put text onto my computer screen. Of course, there is no way to achieve that, but stopping the CC-licensing of text would cut down on it.<p>Certainly, there needed to be some way to assure contributors to, e.g., Wikipedia that Wikipedia would not monopolize their contributions for selfish or stupid ends, but I do not think a CC license (or the GFDL used before that) was anywhere near the optimal way to do that.<p>Maybe I should not state my opinion without having taken a  close look at the effect of CC and similar licenses on textbooks and technical manuals, but I tend to think it is time to stop imploring WRITERS to CC-license their TEXT.",1347042403

And he's actually done something about it [1] with both a format and software to deal with decimal numbers.<p>Further the densely packed form gets very close to optimal in terms of bit representation. Assume that 4 bits (BCD) is 'worst' case, you can represent 0-9 but you 'waste' the information space 'a-f' (in hex, 10-15 in decimal) but 3 bits only gives you 8 states. What you want is a total of 10 states which is 3.3125 bit's worth (best case) or 3 digits in 9.9375 bits, these formats give you 3 digits in 10 bits which is pretty close.<p>Mike goes on to talk about how to build hardware that does floating point operations on this stuff. I built some into an FPGA and it really is pretty straight forward, especially if you do iterative multiply and divide.<p>Consider the interesting thing where you take 128 bits (two 64 bit words) where you use 60 bits for the whole part (18 digits) and 60 bits for the fractional part (18 digits) and you've got 8 bits left over for various non-number entities (+inf, -inf, NaN, etc).

I may write a story and not mind if people repost it, but I don't want it used to promote Neo-Nazi organizations, so I retain moral rights. Now I am told that doing so is ""Orwellian""? Best to avoid all this copyleft stuff altogether given that if you try to retain any rights at all over your own work the groupthinkers will attack you as being a fascist, when it is they who are the true fascists.<p>Only today R.E.M. announced they had a moral objection to Fox News using their work ""Losing My Religion"" to attack the Democratic Party.<p><a href=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/rem-demands-fox-news-stop-losing-my-religion-368710"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/rem-demands-fox-new...</a><p>Do they have the right to stop Fox from using their work to promote propaganda they are deeply morally opposed to?

4490443,comment,4489442,4490165,7,0,drostie,,,"Well, the moral rights available to most authors are not generally Orwellian. One of them, for example, is a right which you cannot waive to say ""I made that"" and perhaps to coerce others into admitting that ""she made that"" (i.e. attribution). CC-BY already does this, as do most open-source licenses. Another is a right which you cannot waive to be able to later say, ""stop using my work,"" as if, for example, some organization you detest, let's say NAMBLA, decided to play your music as inspirational anthems at their meetings. Crucially, if they are economically impacted by this (e.g. they place your music in a film and now your claim forces them to redo the soundtrack, recall all the copies which they've already made and distribute replacements, etc.) then they can usually demand that you pay for the costs involved.<p>French law goes a little further in this vein. In French law, if you paint something racy for a private collector which could perhaps damage your reputation if it went public, you can decide that the private collector is not allowed to put your painting up for public exhibitions, and they have to respect that (at least until you die). If they are going to make a ceremony of burning or defacing your work, you're also entitled to forbid them from doing so -- though I'm not sure how this applies to derivative works, it demands ""respect de l'intgrit de l'oeuvre"" -- respect of the integrity of the work.<p>Moral rights are not strictly <i>copyrights</i> -- they do not forbid copying. They are only incompatible with ""free speech"" in a subset of cases where, arguably, that speech is being used to harm the author of the work. The only peculiarity is that the author of the work is given a very wide latitude to decide what uses of their work are ""harmful"" to them -- but this is probably the only way to avoid massive legal complications.",1347041958

When like less than 3 percent of Boston Ruby programmers are women, something is blatantly wrong. There are probably more factors at work than mere spontaneous career preference that are causing this seriously skewed distribution.<p>This is not just an abstract inconvenience either. Whenever you are part of a historically marginalized minority -- whether by color, gender, or nationality -- it will likely be more uncomfortable for you to enter fields where you are the only person from your group. This is particularly true for women.<p>Not only are sexist comments more likely when there are not a lot of women at events (see <a href=""http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/04/gender-and-sex-at-gogaruco/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/04/gender-and-sex-...</a>), the women will also likely feel more uncomfortable because of the disproportion. Let me quote a posting on our outreach mailing list thread from a woman to elaborate:<p>""I have definitely never experienced anything threatening or offensive at a Ruby group meeting. But, you show up at an event where there are 50 men or more to 3 women, and you grow to expect some double-takes. Some women, like me, are okay with that. A lot aren't. And it makes it hard to show up alone or when you don't know anyone if you know you're going to stick out like a sore thumb. A man can show up at boston.rb for the first time and not have anyone pay the least attention. A woman cannot.<p>""There's some critical mass that needs to be reached before that's not true anymore, and it's just hard work to get there. There  needs to be enough women who don't care if they stick out, so the women who do care don't stick out so much. And you need to make plans to meet the women you know there, so they already know someone. That could be a component of any project night, outreach, or mentorship effort -- encouraging people to come to the meetings, and affirmatively planning to meet them there.""<p>I hope these points carry at least a little weight for you.

4490371,comment,4490294,4490294,1,0,Xcelerate,,,"Nobody has cast doubt on anything in modern quantum mechanics.  If you look at the abstract, it makes this much clearer than the BBC article does:<p>""While there is a rigorously proven relationship about uncertainties intrinsic to any quantum system, often referred to as Heisenbergs uncertainty principle, Heisenberg originally formulated his ideas in terms of a relationship between the precision of a measurement and the disturbance it must create. Although this latter relationship is not rigorously proven, it is commonly believed (and taught) as an aspect of the broader uncertainty principle. Here, we experimentally observe a violation of Heisenbergs measurement-disturbance relationship, using weak measurements to characterize a quantum system before and after it interacts with a measurement apparatus. Our experiment implements a 2010 proposal of Lund and Wiseman to confirm a revised measurement-disturbance relationship derived by Ozawa in 2003. Its results have broad implications for the foundations of quantum mechanics and for practical issues in quantum measurement.""<p>In other words, Heisenberg originally thought that the inability to measure two incompatible observables (like momentum and position) was because of something that is now called the ""observer effect"": <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)</a>  The observer effect applies even to classical systems without quantum mechanics!  You just can't measure something without affecting it in some way [1].<p>The <i>modern</i> version of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle says nothing about measurement disturbing the system.  It instead says that there is an <i>inherent</i> uncertainty to the system.  I've been seeking clarification on what exactly this means for a long time and have never really gotten a satisfactory answer.  I've tried Physics Stack Exchange, my QM professor, even Hacker News and most people either confuse HUP with the observer effect or they reply in illy-defined terms that don't help me any.<p>The best that I can figure out on my own -- the <i>true</i> HUP -- is thus: You can prepare a system in a certain state.  You then take a position measurement and a momentum measurement at the same time.  You get two real numbers.  Now, you repeat the experiment.  Create a system just like you did before and take measurements of r and p.  After multiple repetitions of the same experiment over and over, you'll get two long lists of position and momentum measurements.  Take the standard deviation of the position measurements, multiply that value by the standard deviation of the momentum measurements, and HUP guarantees that the resulting real number will be  /2 (reduced Planck's constant over 2).<p>[1] Well, there's a few loopholes if anyone is curious.",1347041168

However, when women share their experiences in tech or attend events like this, we get reactions like yours where women are challenged and questioned for seeking knowledge in the first place. Instead of attacking women when they participate in tech circles, try listening and stepping back.<p>> It's also the grouping that confuses me. You want more women in the community, and so you are encouraging someone to join your community based on an entirely irrelevant property. You only want them because of their gender. You look at them, and see a woman - just that one property. It's objectification, de-humanisation.<p>So treating women like human beings with genuine interests and struggles and listening to what they have to say and offering resources for them when they are under served in tech is objectifying and dehumanizing?<p>Let's clear something up: women in tech are actively discouraged from existing in those circles in a variety of micro- and macro-level ways. I do not see women as just women, but I do not deny that being a woman is part of their experience and it shapes their life in a way I cannot experience since I am not a woman. Nobody should be excluded from programming and tech because of their gender, but pretending that men and women are on an equal playing field in terms of treatment and opportunity is ludicrous.",1347041077

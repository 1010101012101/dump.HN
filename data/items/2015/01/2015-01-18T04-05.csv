Why?<p>- Python3 currently exists, and there is a large push to get the majority of the &quot;big&quot; packages to support it (many of which <i>do</i> currently support Python 2.x <i>and</i> Python3).<p>- It&#x27;s possible for a Python package to support both Python 2.x and Python3 at the same time or to program the Python 2.x version in such a way that converters like 2to3 can do the conversion for you. I&#x27;m aware of no such tools <i>or</i> capabilities between Perl 5.x and Perl 6.<p>- Python3 isn&#x27;t as ambitious as Perl 6 is/was.<p>Edit: As to point #2, I recall that there may have existed (maybe it still does?) some project to use Perl 6&#x27;s &quot;reprogram the grammar&quot; capabilities to turn Perl 6 into Perl 5. I&#x27;m not sure how I really feel about that though. There was also a time when there was some buzz around Parrot VM[1] that was associated with Perl 6 (I don&#x27;t know if it was some official partnership or just some announcement of Perl 6 support in Parrot).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.parrot.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.parrot.org/</a>",1421557043

Then use the social media management software that&#x27;s being peddled to tweak the wording slightly so you have prepared text stating the same thing 50 different ways. Then if someone gives a counter-argument that you have a prepared response for, you can copy-paste that in a matter of seconds. Arguments you haven&#x27;t prepared for are ignored because the goal isn&#x27;t to engage in dialog, it&#x27;s to give the false impression that a dialog is occurring. To an outside observer the forum would appear to be populated equally by people for and against the topic. Even though it&#x27;s really an overwhelming support for one side and a single agent spamming with 50 different personalities.<p>Derailing a conversation works well because they will have a large number of responses prepared that talk about, using your example, Snowden being a traitor. So once they&#x27;ve wedged the issue their spam can become the dominant voice. If the discussion had drifted to an area they weren&#x27;t prepared for, say the historical precedents for whistleblowers of government misdeeds, they probably don&#x27;t have as much material for that.<p>My point is I assume astroturfed material would not be written off-the-cuff but meticulously edited ahead of time to give the desired impression. And near the top of that list must be the requirement that it not look like an obvious shill.<p>I wonder how effective it would be if agents were able to control both sides of the debate, even?

If they want to put bigoted &quot;holistic&quot;/nonacademic bullshit into their admissions processes, then that&#x27;s about #43,207 on my concerns list. I don&#x27;t have kids so I&#x27;m at least 18 years from this being my issue and the whole fucked-up mix will be different by then (better? worse? who knows?) I don&#x27;t think the fault is mostly with the admissions offices themselves. The academic signals they get are not always reliable; high-school grades are hard to standardize, and the SAT is pretty preppable and doesn&#x27;t go high enough on the math. (The SAT-M should have harder problems that extend it out to ~1000-1100. Or AMC/AIME scores can be given weight in admissions.) But right now, the SAT is too preppable and the relative lightness of academic merit in the admissions process <i>isn&#x27;t</i> the officers&#x27; fault. They are, as you&#x27;ve noted, working with crummy data. In order to believe they&#x27;re doing better than they would at a dartboard, they have to convince themselves to &quot;see things&quot; in a bunch of 17-year-old strangers.<p>What would be of value is to reduce the importance of these brands in the world at-large. It&#x27;s not that I give a damn either way about Stanford or what it does. I do think the pedigree whoring that has crept into &quot;tech&quot; has been to its detriment. Twenty years ago, Silicon Valley was much less pedigree-obsessed. You didn&#x27;t need a Stanford degree to raise capital. These days, we see pedigree being the most important factor in the Valley determining who gets to be a founder and who is merely &quot;Engineer #2&quot; on 0.1% of a $5M company, and we see absolute shit founders like Spiegel and Duplan tapping into that private welfare system. A bit of reversion-to-truth in the power given to brands might be a good thing... not only for the world, but also for elite universities, which would be pushed in the direction of using academic merit again, because the mystique they get in admitting rich idiots and making admissions appear &quot;holistic&quot; would be blown.

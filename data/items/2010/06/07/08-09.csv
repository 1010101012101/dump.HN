Until recently, there was little evidence in animals for either ability. Experiments on memory in food-caching birds, however, question this assumption by showing that western scrub-jays form integrated, flexible, trial-unique memories of what they hid, where and when. Moreover, these birds can adjust their caching behaviour in anticipation of future needs.

1410154,comment,1409759,1410037,0,0,derefr,,,"I never said animals didn't <i>plan</i>, and make decisions; I said they weren't <i>conscious</i>. There's a big difference.<p><i>Planning</i> is the evaluation of alternative, <i>non-conflicting</i> motor programs to determine the cumulative utility of a decision branch. (Basically, a decision-tree A* algorithm.) Animals do plan, but planning is not experienced <i>consciously</i>—it simply happens.<p>Human planning happens on this pre-conscious level as well. If you've ever been in a ""flow state"" where you felt like you didn't actually have to think about anything, because you just ""reacted"" the right way to every problem—that's planning. That's how it feels to be an animal.<p><i>Thinking</i> is, as far as neurology has figured, the resolution of problems that occur during planning by the use of the neocortex to classify features of the current environment into schema, and re-trigger the planning process with expectation programs, looked up from those schema, substituted for motor programs. The most common form of thinking involves verbal expectation programs (basically, saying things to ourselves, in our heads, and then reprocessing those words as if they were external sensory inputs.) This is experienced as consciousness, and as far as we know, only humans do it.<p>Without the ability to think consciously—to resolve motor-program conflicts—an animal can't ""argue"" with itself about which course of action to choose. Instead, it just has a best intuition about which one will work out, and goes with it. These intuitions rely greatly on habituation—in fact, without expectation programs (and thus without semantic knowledge), memory as a whole consists purely <i>of</i> process knowledge—internal finite-state machines of habituated reactions.",1275899926

1410131,comment,1409107,1410097,0,0,ahlatimer,,,"I've had a number of really weird experiences with Ambien. I know, from some things I've said to other people while on it, that there are a number of things that I experienced of which I have no recollection. The things I <i>do</i> remember are fairly crazy in their own right. I'm not sure if this is the place to discuss this, but I'll mention a few things that I've experienced. At the very least, this should serve as a warning to anyone considering taking Ambien.<p>I was once convinced I was on the set of the Goonies, because my comforter happened to look like a cave. I've only seen bits and pieces of that movie, so I have no idea why I hallucinated about it. I told someone ""this lady needs to sell some chickens"" because I saw a woman in the middle of my room selling chickens. I saw pixies dancing in the middle of my room. I saw a little girl, about the height of the toilet, that was sucked behind it as I approached. I also called or texted a number of people and told them a bunch of things that made absolutely no sense. Things like ""I don't trust you. You might read my books."" Or telling them I was flying and how much I loved them. I have a subtle recollection of the latter, absolutely none of the former. I never had a ""bad trip"", in that I never experienced anything that made me fearful or feel bad. It was all very euphoric, but, from my understanding, this isn't true for everyone.<p>If you're into the whole recreational drug thing, I can't say that Ambien is a bad choice as a hallucinogen. The hangovers were mild, and only came about from large doses (~30mg). I never took it for that purpose, but I realize there are people (not necessarily here) that might be interested. As far as using it as a sleep aid, I wouldn't suggest anyone go near the stuff. It's great the first few times you take it, but the tolerance sets on rather quickly. I ended up just hallucinating until the time I would normally fall asleep. I never became dependent, but it seems that addiction isn't necessarily uncommon for those that take it for long periods of time. If you are having trouble sleeping, try melatonin supplements and light therapy. Melatonin doesn't work for everyone, but, honestly, I'd rather have a few nights where I'm unable to sleep than the hangovers and hallucinations I got from Ambien.<p>TL;DR: Ambien makes for a really shitty sleep-aid.",1275898820

Because now we've got deflation. And that produces a really big incentive to save. Too big an incentive. Everything will be cheaper tomorrow, so every individual benefits by burying money in the backyard and spending as little as possible.<p>That's basically just summed up modern macroeconomic thought right there. The problem is, it's wrong for a lot of reasons.<p>First off, deflation is a good thing - deflation means tomorrow you can get more for the same price. The industry in the most rapid deflation over the last 10 years has been the computer industry - you can much, much more computer for the same money now than you could at any point in the past. This is, by itself, a good thing.<p>Now, not everything is prone to deflation anyways, and you've got to realize that deflation lowers costs on both the producing and consuming side. So farmers are getting lower prices for their food gradually, but their tools and tractors are getting cheaper too.<p>But will the economy grind to a halt without new money coming into it? Well, the historical pre-central-banking answer is no of course, but why is that?<p>It's because people won't put their money under the mattress - they'll try to get their money (and thus, resources) producing more wealth for them.<p>Under a normal, sane, classical banking system, this is by giving it to a loan banker. What's a loan banker? He's someone you give your money to, who lends it out, but you can only get your money at certain times, not whenever you want. So you give him your $10,000, he says he'll give you back $10,000 + X in one year.<p>X is the interest you get paid. The loan banker charges the borrower interest for the money. Say, 10%. The borrower has to pay back $11,000 after a year. Then the banker gives, for easy math, let's say 5% to you. So you get back $10,500.<p>But wait - why doesn't the economy grind to a halt? Because the borrower spends the money, and increases productivity with it, thus paying back the loan. If he fails to, the banker collects the collateral and sells it to recover as much as he can. You risk your money by giving it to the banker, but if his operation is sound, it's not that much of a risk.<p>Anyway, loan bankers are extinct in the USA, we only have savings-and-loan banks, where you can get your money at any time. A bank where you could get your money at any time used to be called a deposit bank, but they didn't loan your money out for you, they kept it and transferred it to other people for you when you wrote a check. You actually paid to keep your money safe in a deposit bank, whereas loan banks paid you.<p>Mixing the two - your money is gone and loaned out, but you can collect it any time regardless - this is where the need for central banks originated. There was a landmark legal case in England about whether this mixed form of banking was fraud or not in the late 1600's, and the judge said it wasn't, and that's where today's banking system came from, but I think the judge made a mistake.<p>Long story really really short, you don't need to inject new money, people will loan it out very carefully into productive endeavors, and that's why all the non-central-banking economies throughout history didn't grind to a halt. True, they get slower growth in most years, but you also don't get the crippling nasty bank crashes that central banking creates.",1275898711

I have a 256GB flash drive... made in china by some knockoff, not kingston and it shows. I've had to reformat it like 3-4 times, and it's read/write speed is a joke. Still it cost me less than some 64gb drives so it's all relative.<p>I agree that adding >$100 for a 16gb upgrade in a phone or even 32gb is a little much but to step it up from 128gb and keep speed and some form of reliability is gonna cost you.",1360310368
5186811,comment,5185563,5186785,2,0,gbhn,,,"Most would-be providers of bandwidth to consumers are guarding legacy premium bandwidth sales. The phone company would like to sell you differentiated phone bandwidth at 10x market rates. The cable company would like to sell you differentiated TV bandwidth at 10x market rates.<p>One approach would be to unbundle internet from premium bandwidth services offered by the same company over the same channel. Suppose the US was organized with a tier of companies competing to offer you cheap, reliable bandwidth, and a tier of companies competing to offer you premium services riding atop that bandwidth. Other countries have a model similar to this, and they generally have much better bandwidth services. In the US, we're tied to legacy investments in carrier infrastructure that make moving to such a system very difficult.<p>Personally, I think we should just pay them off and start fresh. Unfortunately, that ends up basically looking like nationalization, which in the US is extremely difficult politically.",1360310365

The VM-backed programming environment is what Valve perceive as the new gaming market here: they don't want just a console, they want their own iDevice or Kindle Fire.<p>Mr. Newell mentioned that Valve's games were shifting to a free-to-play scheme. The Steam Box might be something like this: a Linux-based OS, some sort of runtime/VM, a game-writing API (Source-based API?) and an online, on-console marketplace. Whether the VM is Android or even based on Java at all would remain to be seen.<p>The basic Source (or successor) engine might be distributed built into the Steam Box, with expansions ranging from full-on games to amusing hats available for immediate purchase and automatic delivery. Probably some back-catalog goodies will ship with the box/be registered to your Steam account, too.",1360310204

5186799,comment,5185122,5186311,1,0,ridiculous_fish,,,"I don't know much about Android's layout, but from what I have seen, it looks rather ad-hoc. For example, LinearLayout (<a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/LinearLayout.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Linear...</a>) looks to be a core layout class. It has boolean properties like ""baselineAligned"" and ""measureWithLargestChild;"" these appear to have been added as needs arose, instead of being part of a general layout theory.<p>Autolayout, on the other hand, has a more general approach of establishing relationships between properties of views. Baseline alignment then just falls out:  make view1.baseline = view2.baseline, or view1.top = view2.top for top alignment if you prefer. Equal widths fall out too: view1.width = view2.width. If you want a vertical stack you can write view1.bottom = view2.top. If you want a fixed aspect ratio (say, 4/3), you can write view1.width = view1.height * 4/3.<p>The result is that it's possible to directly express complex layout ideas. For example, ""make three buttons baseline aligned, 10 pixels apart, all of them equal width, none of them clipping their labels. If they cannot fit, then in turn: shrink the padding down to 4 pixels, don't require them to be equal width, truncate the first button's label, or lastly then grow the window / make the view scrollable, until they fit.""<p>That's an unrealistically elaborate example, but with autolayout it can be done entirely in IB, without any code at all. I am guessing with Android it would take a fair amount of manual work.<p>So my view from a distance is that the autolayout approach is more general and elegant, while the Android approach may handle simple cases easily, but is more ad-hoc and random.",1360310051

However, humans are omnivores so we're pretty flexible in what we can eat and stay healthy.<p>Also, there are plenty of unhealthy and downright hazardous natural products.

Cassava is highly toxic when eaten raw and the right variety can easily kill a human with a dose the size of an ordinary meal if not prepared correctly.

It's a pain in the neck :/<p>With bootstrap we really just want to give everyone the most reliable product we can, and css transitions just aren't that.<p>Also, from what I hear, the spec is basically dead in the water and a reliable cancel event isn't in the works (unless this has changed in the last month or so) which is more of a reason to consider alternatives.<p>Most likely we will end up going with some sort of combination.

Minsky, for instance, is a Cognitive Psychology theorist, though he is outside of the mainstream of the field.<p>Neuroscience and Cognitive Psychology are the same department at MIT. This does not indicate a move away from Psychology, however. It indicates a commitment to pursuing Psychology more scientifically than it has sometimes been practiced. But Cognitive Psychology has been practiced in a scientific manner for at least 50 years now.<p>The Behaviorists also pursued Psychology scientifically. Their theory was just wrong in many respects, and has been proven hopelessly over-simplified as an overarching theory of the mind. (I.e., they weren't particularly <i>good</i> scientists.) On the other hand, Behaviorism is still useful for some things. E.g., training your dog to perform tricks.<p>""Purely psychological"" causes of serious mental illness such as major depression and schizophrenia have not been the mainstream of Psychological belief since I was in junior high, and I was in junior high a long time ago.<p>As to not being able to study the mind scientifically, that is patently false. The mind is a computer program running on the hardware of the brain, and just as any computer program can be reverse engineered scientifically, so can the human mind. Neuroscientists do ""white box"" reverse engineering and cognitive psychologists do ""black box"" reverse engineering. Both are productive approaches, and the two fields are in constant communication with each other. That's why, for instance, they are in the same department at MIT.",1360309116

Trust me, I would love to make Linux my primary desktop, and every few months when I have some time, I give it another serious shot. But I always end up back to dual booting.<p>Years ago, I was happy with OSS audio system, but that is controlled by one company so the FOSSies have done their best to replace it with a far inferior ALSA. This caused me so many headaches back in the day and still bothers me with its high latency. But lately my issue has been with the graphics subsystem. For my X1900 I have to chose between open source drivers with terrible performance and bugs or proprietary drivers that don't work with modern kernels.<p>Finally, X windows and gaming don't seem to mix. Here is a case, where I think Linux needs to change the interface. I think Wayland may be the answer. If not, at least X11 with decent full screen support would be a godsend.<p>So from my perspective for Linux to make it, it would have to use :<p>1) OSSv4 Audio Subsystem (FOSSies it's GPL'd already get over it)<p>2) Stable graphics driver interface ( or FOSSies stop breaking ATI and Nvidia's drivers )<p>3) Modern Display Server - maybe Wayland or throwing out all the kruff in X11 and fixing Full Screen graphics in games",1360307612

It's not entirely unlike how jQuery spices up DOM elements, and feels natural that way.<p>Then, suddenly, however, there came a validation engine with annotations and reflection and whatnot. Huh? Isn't that a whole different thing? Why is this bundled with my nice little jQuery-for-PHP-scalars? It's not just that it feels like it's a different problem entirely and thus should be separate, the code <i>feels</i> different.

5186688,comment,5185884,5185884,2,0,zmmmmm,,,"R is probably the most frustrating language I've ever had to learn. For me, R doesn't so much have a learning ""curve"" as a learning ""gradient"". After a long, long time the rate of frustrations is not really leveling off much. Each time I have to negotiate a new library or module that I'm not familiar with I'm guaranteed hours of frustration as I try to grapple with what all the data types are, how they are subtly overridden to behave differently from the normal data types they inherit from, what things are going to be magically coerced into what other things without me realising it.<p>Even after 2 years of involvement with it, I regularly meet problems that frustrate me for hours, because they are hard to express in R's functional style. Even when I figure out the final solution, it often performs very poorly. In between these frustrations R behaves almost magically. It manipulates huge data sets with an ease and simplicity that defies logic. I've eventually come to the conclusion that an important aspect of R is knowing when NOT to use it. If your task is inherently stateful, involves random access to lots of sparse relational data that is associated in complex ways and with complicated logic - R is going to make your life hell. Write a quick script to pre-process your data and get things into more like a straight data table form and then proceed with R to analyse and visualize it.  This is my experience, anyway!",1360307288

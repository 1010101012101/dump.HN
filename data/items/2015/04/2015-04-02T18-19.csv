9312519,comment,9311843,9312100,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"The costs of bitcoin you describe are systemic costs, not transaction fees. At 0 or 1 trillion transactions, the block rewards would be the same, which means they&#x27;re not marginal costs, i.e. fees per transaction. They&#x27;re unrelated.<p>They pertain to money supply, a necessary force to get a currency out into the world. That causes inflation, which is not a direct price people pay (the transaction fees are a direct price, and those are a few pennies). Inflation is an indirect price. But if you look at bitcoin&#x27;s history, its price is thousands of percent higher than just a few years ago, meaning that the cost is not actually incurred by those who use and transact or receive bitcoin.<p>In the long-run, this inflation will stop, and part of the fees will be covered by a larger amount of transactions that each cost pennies. If 50 million people used bitcoin in a decade, you can still pay pennies per transaction but cut block rewards without a drop in security.<p>If you do the math, bitcoin is easily the cheapest currency to transact in, which is why companies like Bitpesa exist undercutting remittance, and why Bitpay offers a 0% Saas payment processing fee, and why other merchant processors like Coinbase all undercut any creditcard, or Stripe, or Square, or Paypal, and why Paypal, Stripe and Square all have implemented bitcoin options into their services, and why companies like Microsoft accept bitcoin and keep more profits than they otherwise would if they had accepted the payment through e.g. a CC or Paypal.",1427999398

9312517,comment,9311978,9311978,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"At first, venture capital was (may have been?) like any other investment strategy: the goal is to generate a portfolio that delivers a high return on investment.<p>The problem? Variance, mixed with a short-term/instant-gratification culture at all levels of society. The more variance, the more whale-driven the business. You end up with binary returns: no whale, and you lose (relative to your peers) and even if you did everything else right it fucks up your career; or you get a whale, and you win. The doubles (3x) and triples (10x) don&#x27;t matter and it&#x27;s all about the elusive home runs (1000x). Or, I believe the term of art these days is &quot;unicorn&quot;, because chasing an animal that only exists in the mind of people under 10 just makes sense in this culture of neoteny.<p>The second-stage venture capital wasn&#x27;t about portfolio returns. Even if you had a profitable array of doubles and triples, you could face redemptions or struggle to raise the next fund, because you wouldn&#x27;t have a <i>visible</i> proof of competence. Sure, you did 20% per-year, but that guy over there who lucked into Facebook did 25% per-year (even though that one lucky call saved him).<p>Also, the career-making allure of <i>access</i> outgrew the original job of delivering the best returns possible. So it became about &quot;having been in on&quot; a Google or a Facebook, even if most of the portfolio withered on the vine. That&#x27;s why you get the culture of note-sharing (often inappropriate and illegal) and co-funding and collusion. VCs aren&#x27;t chasing returns, which is what their investors want; they&#x27;re chasing the intangibles that come with the appearance of prescience and social access, and those only come with the whales. An added bonus for VCs, which helps them personally but not their portfolios, of the extremely-high-variance strategy is that it opens up executive positions for underachieving friends who need favors. &quot;Lifestyle&quot; businesses that grow at 30% per year don&#x27;t, because those tend to need specialized skills at executive levels. But the neat thing about a company that is really just a pile of cash and young coders ready to &quot;pivot&quot; on a dime is that any idiot can be placed at an executive level.<p>In this third phase, the game isn&#x27;t about <i>finding</i> big winners but <i>creating</i> them. The VCs have fully grown into their role of king-makers, injecting huge sums of cash to end the game for all competitors almost instantly, create a &quot;natural monopoly&quot;, and exploit it for 5-15 years until the monopolistic advantage fades (as it will if the idea is any good). Your product doesn&#x27;t matter if your competitor gets a 9-figure injection, because that&#x27;ll pay poaching fees for your best people, generate a lot of press, and push you aside.<p>That&#x27;s where we are, now. The VCs don&#x27;t invest money into a market that then decides what succeeds or fails. They have so much money that <i>they</i> pick the winners, with not only their resources but their nearly absolute power over exit arrangements. (&quot;Call Tom at Google. He owes me a favor. Let him acqui-hire this stinker at $4M per engineer so I don&#x27;t have to think about it anymore.&quot;) Obviously, there are constraints upon them because they can&#x27;t just fund anything-- they would run out of political capital if all they produced were stinkers-- but they have so much power at this point that almost all valuations are recursive.",1427999378

GH is social software development.
Facebook is Linkdin for my personal life.
Tumblr is lazy blogging. Very noisy.
Snapchat is faster picture texting. For many people this really is just cereal-bowl-boring.
Instagram is photography made easy.

9312496,comment,9309928,9309928,0,0,zeidrich,,,"They seem to be creating two classifications, one sort of &quot;correct, pristine&quot; meme that somehow mutates randomly and is somehow more natural; another which is apparently a bad thing, which is a meme that is manipulated to intentionally spread.<p>But this is a poor distinction.  All memes as we think of them are artificial.  There&#x27;s nothing more natural about the changing shape of pottery than there is about cropping a photo and applying text to it.<p>A meme is a idea, an element of culture. When they spread they persist. The idea of making an image macro is a meme, the idea to share it online is too, the subject is too.  They are more or less effective depending on how likely they will be shared.  If I were to make an image macro that wasn&#x27;t interesting and nobody else repeated it, it&#x27;s still a meme, but it&#x27;s impotent and it dies out.<p>The difference between image macros and pottery is more to do with how we communicate and how we handle new ideas.  The Internet makes exposure to these things so much wider.  But similarly we pass them on because of the simple feedback that we get, the e-pats on the back, the LOLs, the well playeds, the trolling.  This is also promoted by the wide exposure.  If you post an impressive image macro to the internet, you might get a response from 1% of the people who see it.  You might get someone to copy it 0.1% of the time.   In a place like reddit that might mean you have it copied 10 times for one post.  If you were in ancient Assyria and you developed some equally impressive pottery technique, you&#x27;d be lucky if one person you show it to appreciates it and incredibly lucky for someone to want to copy it.<p>The Internet is kind of like a rainforest or coral reef for memes.  Food is abundant, so all sorts of small but curious diversity pops up.  They&#x27;re not the most effective ideas, just the flashiest, and in some ways this might detract from the strongest ideas because they&#x27;re not as flashy.<p>But that has nothing to do with how we define memes, but rather how easy it is to share information on the Internet.  I don&#x27;t think you can say it&#x27;s a good thing or a bad thing.  There&#x27;s a lot of diversity in ideas with something as abundant in meme food as the Internet, it leads to a bit more chaos and people, genetically, are adapted to a much slower rate of information and change.",1427999134

It&#x27;s been around since the beginnings of civilization. It&#x27;s hardwired into our parenting, education, and government models. A small, committed team can try organizational structures that run counter to everything we&#x27;ve been taught for our entire lives - but does it scale?<p>More than Trotsky, this makes me think of Bakunin, Kropotkin, and other anarcho-syndicalists. This sort of &quot;classical anarchism&quot; also focuses on the problems and failures of the C&C hierarchy, but attempts to deal with it by rejecting the hierarchy altogether, beyond local control - if you can&#x27;t punch your boss in the nose anymore, there&#x27;s too much structure. Society is then organized into direct democracy around the means of production - farms, factories, businesses that elect their leaders locally and can remove them from power at any time.<p>Anarcho-syndicalism was put into practice in the Spanish Civil War, when the workers simply stopped answering to their bosses and instead ran things for themselves. And it got <i>crushed</i>. If there was one thing the fascists and communists (both strong C&C structures) could agree on, it was that the anarchists were the enemy. And when your little farm commune got visited by a thousand soldiers with tanks and artillery, you got wiped out, no matter how pure the ideology.<p>I can imagine a similar problem with Holocratic businesses - traditional businesses might well be uncomfortable dealing with such an organization, when they can&#x27;t trust the authority of the leadership of the Holocratic structure. And if you try to keep a Holocratic structure internally while maintaining traditional outward-facing executive leadership, you&#x27;re sooner or later going to have a problem of &quot;because the CTO said so&quot;. The question of who has the power to fire in a Holocratic organization? You&#x27;ll get your answer soon enough.<p>And there&#x27;s the rub, isn&#x27;t it? If you have an organization large enough to transition from anarcho-syndicalism to a deeper C&C structure, but try to do software-enhanced anarcho-syndicalism (which is kinda what Holocracy is), then you&#x27;re going to have a hidden, obscured C&C structure riding along inside your Holocratic cloud. And real, final power will be with C&C, which in turn derives its authority from the owners/board, which in turn derive authority from common law and social convention. But with everyone knowing that there&#x27;s a metaphorical gun to their heads, Holocratic decisions will be made with the unspoken acknowledgement that someone can/will get fired over bad decisions.

Still, it seems useful to combine proofs, induction, graph theory and related domains into one course. I did opt for taking a large number of math classes and some fairly high-level electives, and I have to say the most interesting area I came across was the use of generating functions for solving recurrence relations and the study of the Catalan numbers. For those of you unfamiliar with the Catalan numbers, it is the sequence of the number of binary trees that can be created with a certain number of elements. Another area they come up in (among a large number of problems) is creating paths by Manhattan distance.<p>The Catalan numbers also count the number of expressions with matching pairs of parentheses.",1427998514

Nobody needs it to pay their taxes, and it&#x27;s not widespread enough to be worth having for the common person. Naturally this could change, but until then you&#x27;ve got a game theory problem.<p>The protocol side is what makes it interesting. The protocol is basically a way for us to collectively scribble on a giant wall that grows every 10 minutes. And that wall cannot be changed, thanks to the clever incentive system that makes the primary use to account for who owns which bitcoins. The technology would still work if you used it to scribble love letters, but nobody would have an interest in keeping the system going.<p>So is this protocol useful? It very well could be. For instance, any number of currency-like things could be (and are) accounted for. You could put the whole land registry on the blockchain, and then you&#x27;d always be able to verify some person owned a parcel. You can put documents (or hashes of documents) in it and prove it existed at some time. The list goes on.<p>The big question is whether this protocol is economical and convenient enough to actually displace what&#x27;s there already. We already have a land registry. We already have notaries.<p>There also needs to be some thought put in about how the infrastructure will be paid for. If the currency is useless, why do miners want to keep mining? Sure, there&#x27;s the potential it won&#x27;t be useless in the future, but how long can you string along an operation like that for? How do you plan if the price is so volatile it might be zero or a million in five years? Each price implies a very different level of investment.<p>One strategy might be a slightly different altcoin system (many, many altcoins have been invented) that tries to share the cost evenly, so no one economic actor has a special position. Another thing you could do is pass real money instead of BTCs.<p>But I think the protocol core is here to stay.",1427998224

If we&#x27;re lucky, they&#x27;ll be able to stave off deflation.<p>So if you&#x27;ve sold your assets and want to store your value, you really want some sort of ledger with a predictable supply so your value can go up, not stay the same or decrease by 2%. Gold is traditional the ledger that people seek when these sorts of things happen. But enough people will choose Bitcoin to raise the price significantly, which will make others choose it as well.<p>Gold might be the right bet, but Bitcoin is a more functional ledger (easy to store, easy to transfer, etc.), and the upside is higher. But again, maybe I&#x27;m crazy.",1427998009

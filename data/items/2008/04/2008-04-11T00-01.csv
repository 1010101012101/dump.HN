160560,comment,160261,160416,0,0,ken,,,"This is actually one of my big gripes with Python: loops don't scale.<p>If I've got something small, it looks great to say [f(x) for x in Y], and then I add ""...if x.z > m"", and then I add something else, and 10 minutes later I say ""ugh, too much!"", and have to rewrite it as a for-loop.  If I want to add a ""print"" in there while I'm experimenting, I'm completely SOL (yes, I know about 3.0a).  The final form of a loop might not look anything like its initial form, even though they're nearly identical, both to me and to the computer.<p>In Common Lisp, in contrast, I can start with (loop for x in Y collect (f x)), and then add clauses all day -- LOOP, for all of its flaws, scales great from a couple words of pseudo-English surrounded by a pair of parens, up to just about anything that can be expressed as a loop.  (CL-ITERATE might be even better, but I haven't gotten around to learning it yet.)<p>Maybe if I had an Emacs function to convert between list comprehensions and for-loops this wouldn't bug me so much.",1207875410

160540,comment,160408,160408,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"He's wrong because for most people, their friends and their social life are more important than the rest of the stuff on the internet. You can't google your friend's birthday. You can look it up on Facebook. You can't google for photos of what happened at the bar last saturday. You can look it up on facebook. Oh, you didn't get that cute girl's number last night? She's a friend's friend right? Sweet, she accepted the friend request. You can't do that on google, and previously, if you forgot to get her number on the spot, you were out of luck in real life, too. You can't google for ""what should I do friday night"" but you can use facebook to find out what people you know might be doing. If you are already anti social and simply sit at home in your boxer shorts, then yes, Facebook makes no sense. But if you actually have friends and do stuff with them, it is a very useful tool. I'm almost certain that 90% of anyone that went to college in the USA in the past 5 years has 2 sites they visit every day: facebook and google. There is no other way at the moment to use the internet to do the things I mentioned above.<p>On the other hand, the applications can be overwhelmingly irritating. The news feed is a blessing and a curse. I like to know when there are new photos of my friends to check out, but I don't care about what Zombie they just became. And regarding the app signup notifications in the feed: there are some things I'd rather not know about my friends, and one of them is how much time they are spending goofing off on Facebook...<p>Note to startup hackers: if you're on facebook and more than 50% of your news feed is your CEO's random facebook activity, it might be time to look for a new job (or start your own thing.)",1207874218

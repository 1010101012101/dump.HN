You're right that radio would have a much greater range.\n - The main advantage I can think of for a system like this would be speed of deployment. In an area with poor line of sight, they could be used to bridge the gap until a proper base-station can be positioned.\n - They're more versatile. For example, they could be used as a mobile PA system.\n - Of course, it's all hypothetical. Nevertheless, it'd be fun to implement and more useful than the Pirate Bay's idea of a flying datacenter.",1354838336

And no, precisely because of the legal entity we call a corporation. IANAL, mind you, so I might have this completely wrong. But as I understand it, the whole point is that Best Buy as a whole is punished, and if the <i>corporation</i> feels that the best way to learn from this mistake is to punish its executives, that's their prerogative. The bad decision was made by representatives of the corporation acting in the capacity of said corporation: therefore the party at fault is the corporation, not the individuals.<p>(To people more familiar with law, I'd appreciate confirmation that I got this right.)",1354838285

When your website conversion rate jumps from 10% to 12% then is it 2% rise in conversion rate or 20% rise in conversion rate?</i><p>This question doesn't have a clear answer, because the values are already percentages.  Imagine the original numbers refer to apples.  First there were 10 apples, then 12 apples.  The absolute increase is 2 apples; the relative increase is 20%.  Obviously, if you say ""the increase is __ apples"" or ""the increase is __ %"" there's only one right way to replace the blanks with numbers.  But since 10 and 12 are already percentages, the absolute and relative changes would be stated as ""the increase is 2%"" (absolute increase) and ""the increase is 20%"" (relative increase.)  They mean different things, but they're both correct statements if interpreted correctly.<p>In practice, people will expect one and interpret the other as wrong.

I do compound lifts and do extensive cardio nearly every day. For about a month now, I've been bike commuting to work (30 miles round trip) even in the rain. I used to eat a load of red meat every week, but now I've been pescatarian for a good two months. I typically sleep before midnight and brush my teeth twice a day (gum infections are bad! and expensive to treat!).<p>But what I find much more difficult than taking care of myself is getting friends to take care of themselves. Telling them bluntly that ""you need to get in shape"" or ""you should go to the gym"" or ""you should stop eating junk food"" isn't likely to get them to change. But what I've found is that oftentimes, indirect methods are more effective tools for bringing about change than the blunt, direct, brash modes of influence. A person might not want to go to a gym by themselves, but they're much more likely to come out to a long hike with a small group of mutual friends, followed by a healthy lunch downtown.<p>I have a longtime friend who's become out of shape over the years that I hadn't seen him (I was out of the area for the good part of the last 10 years). He's has easily one of the sharpest minds I have encountered, completely trumping my own mind in every way. To think that his health may expedite his eventual demise is an idea that tortures me.<p>I'm hoping that I'll be able to gently, indirectly, steer him back to the good health he used to be in 10 years ago (he used to compete on a national level in a certain sport).",1354838211

4884584,story,,,9,13,tagabek,"Advice for a beginner iOS developer?",,"Hi, HN! I recently got into iOS development, and I absolutely love it. Last year, I fiddled around with Python, web design, some Java, and even a very tiny amount of Android development. I knew for a while that I wanted to move towards iOS development, but I thought that because I didn't have a Mac, my dream was just a dream. Well, I came to a pretty huge turning point in my life last year, and that shift completely changed my view on what can be reality. I ended up trading my gaming laptop with a friend for a Macbook Pro. After a bit of testing a few methods of learning Objective-C (I tried Stanford's iOS Development class on iTunes U, but I was only able to get through the first assignment), I got Big Nerd Ranch's Objective-C Programming eBook and literally blew through it in a week. I loved it! Immediately afterwards, I bought BNR's iOS Programming eBook, and am now blasting through that. It's an extraordinarily awesome feeling to tackle and accomplish the challenges within the chapters. I also have a few ideas that I cannot wait to build after finishing the book.<p>Anyway, I apologize for my novel, but now I'll get to the point. Can any current iOS developers share some advice?<p>Here are the main things I am looking for:<p>- What are the best ways to get noticed? (My main goal is to work for a startup - I am 18, and a freshman in college as a CS major, but I am open to taking a hiatus if the opportunity came up. I also started meeting developers in my area, and blogging is beginning to be a natural activity for me.)<p>- What are your experiences with building/marketing your first (few) app(s)?<p>- What are the biggest things I should look out for as a beginning iOS developer? Any and all advice is highly appreciated!<p>Side note: I am not solely interested in iOS development but it is 99.9% of my focus right now. I hear, ""Software engineering is an industry where you will adapt and constantly be learning,"" quite often, and that is exactly what I want to do!",1354838186
4884583,comment,4882868,4884035,3,0,pvh,,,"Absolutely. Basically, as long as your app is running somewhere with Very Good Latency to your database, this can be a fine pattern. In practice, this means if the data center is also in Ashburn, Virginia, and better yet, has a DirectConnect deal set up with AWS, you should be in business. The best way to test this is to provision a database and see how latency from your app is. My opinion is that 5ms latency would be a ceiling on what I'd tolerate for my own apps, and I'd probably look for more like 1-2ms or better.",1354838181

The major, major strides in implant technology have generally happened outside the body - speech processing packs have gone from shoulder worn packs to behind-the-ear models.<p>You need to bear in mind that we're not dealing with traditional technology here: we're dealing with implanted medical devices. This is not a situation where Moore's law applies. It is vastly cheaper to spend R&D developing speech/music processing algorithms than trying to cram more and more electrodes into implants which require extensive testing and certification by the likes of the FDA.<p>To be honest, it's not a difficult decision at all. If you're happy with your child having an implant[1], you would be <i>crazy</i> to wait a few years 'just in case' the technology improved. Children implanted at an early age can often adapt far more rapidly than those who are older.<p>But it's a moot argument, because like I say these implants are not like smartphones that get improved every year. It is simply too costly to not only re-certify, but to re-train surgeons and audiologists on the new devices. Developing improvements to the external processing units is <i>many factors</i> cheaper than upgrading the implants themselves.<p>[1] There are some parents who do not necessarily approve or want their children to get implants, but not for the reasons you suggest. This mainly happens with parents who themselves are deaf, or part of the deaf community. This is a whole other ethical kettle of fish though!",1354837447

4884412,comment,4883844,4883844,7,0,mdasen,,,"I'm excited that T-Mobile is looking to boost its network and committing to a bit of a different direction than many US carriers have taken.  AT&T and Verizon are going toward on-contract, subsidized devices paired with expensive plans.  Sprint seems to be trying to price discriminate with customers who want the latest devices paying AT&T and Verizon style rates on-contract with Boost and Virgin trying to pick up cheaper customers who are willing to live without the latest devices and keeping them off the latest network that Sprint customers get access to (4G LTE).  T-Mobile seems to be trying a somewhat European strategy.  It's clearly being altered to live up to American appetites (for example, they're going to finance what would have been the device's subsidy).  This may not turn out to be something amazing, but it's exciting to see one of the 4 wireless companies pushing for a new direction.<p>It's also good to see T-Mobile pushing fast for 4G LTE.  While HSPA+ 42 does offer good speeds, the marketing perception won't change and the fact that ping times are worse on HSPA+ does mean that important real-world use cases can lag.  I'm a little dubious of their schedule.  Sprint started working on LTE a long while ago and thought they would have 120M POPs covered by the end of 2012.  Considering that they've been launching more rural areas and haven't been able to launch in several cities they announced a while ago, it seems like it's going to take Sprint a good while longer than they had anticipated.  T-Mobile is saying that they will have 100M POPs covered half a year from now and 200M POPs covered a year from now.  That's ambitious.  Judging from Sprint's slipping release schedule, it might be prudent to think that T-Mobile's projections might also slip.<p>However, if T-Mobile's dates slip on LTE a bit, it shouldn't hurt them too badly.  Their customers can fall back to HSPA+ 42 and that provides a good network experience (if not as good).  This is in contrast to Verizon and Sprint customers who fall back to EV-DO when out of LTE coverage range.  That probably doesn't matter for a lot of Verizon customers, but Sprint is still working to cover top markets.<p>T-Mobile does have some good assets.  The fact that they're going to be able to launch with 10MHz LTE will be good since it should match what Verizon and AT&T are deploying and out-do Sprint's 5MHz deployment.  If they merge with MetroPCS, they will have a good spectrum position to continue growing LTE on including 20MHz LTE channels.  Lower/different pricing combined with unlimited 4G might start attracting customers.  Part of this is just undue excitement over the prospect of a re-invigorated competitor in an industry dominated by two carriers.  Still, maybe T-Mobile will pull it off.",1354835519

This is not the case with fiat money where governments can print money and demand you take it in exchange for products and services.<p>In high inflation economies like Argentina for example where foreign currency is strictly controlled, people are starting to save in bitcoin to preserve their wealth.  I've heard that one can get a very good exchange rate for bitcoins in Argentina.",1354835213

Before I could download it I was presented with multiple alerts and pages of bullshit regarding my Apple ID and the App Store terms of service. Not a good experience.<p>-1 for not having a link to create a new account from the first dialogue box in the app. I can either log in or start without an account, but not create a new one? There's also no hint as to where I should go to make a new account. I clicked ""forgot key"" and worked it out from there.<p>-1 for not explaining the ""open source"" plan very well. What does ""public"" mean? Does that mean anybody can watch videos of whatever I'm working on?<p>-1 for making the credentials I actually need to use the app non-obvious. You should know that I'm coming from your app when I sign up for a new account, and when I'm done signing up, show me my account key in big, fat, auto-copyable text, instead of hiding it two screens later.<p>-1 for not automatically taking me to my localhost URL after Sauce Connect initializes. I had to say I wanted to go to a localhost URL, wait for Sauce Connect to initialize, and then try to connect to the URL again.<p>But once I got the thing working, it's really great!

The music is public domain, so I think anyone can profit from selling these; I don't think the families of these guys see a cent. And if they did, geting that cent would take a fair few Spotify plays anyhows ;)<p>There's over 400 John Lee hooker albums available, 146 Robert Johnson albums and 1007 Billie Holiday albums. Not even Frank Zappa has cut that many records.<p>My idea is to build a music streaming platform that serves up exclusively public domain music to fans of older music, like blues, folk, jazz, country etc. and it exists solely to pull in money from subscribers and divide it in a better way then rdio and others do. Most importantly, the money would go to surviving families of these artists and operate as a non profit entity.<p>I have an idea of how a payout model could work for this more effectively then current streaming models used on rdio etc.<p>Please do get in touch if you'd like to help put this together.",1354834992

4884374,comment,4881831,4881831,14,0,ChristopherM,,,"It's amazing how defensive some of these posts are because the poster has chosen to live a life by default.<p>I once thought I wanted to climb the corporate ladder, to buy stuff, toys. More, more, more...<p>I made my way into software management back in 2008.  I was absolutely miserable.  The routine, wake up to an alarm, get ready, run to work, work on someone else's ideas, have to listen to someone tell me what to do.  When I got home, I had no energy to work on my own stuff.  Work, had stolen all my will power and mental energy.  I consoled myself, by losing myself in movies and games, drinking.<p>Then in 2009, I was so miserable I deliberately worked to get terminated with severance.  I was successful.  The evening I was fired I was so happy.  I was set for 1 year.  I moved from L.A. to San Francisco.<p>Got an apartment, and started learning all of adobe's tools (my friend got me a free copy of their top suite, he worked there).  I experimented with many different compression algorithm techniques, I worked on neural networks.  Then after 9 months, and the money running out I took a trip to Budapest Hungary for 1 month to learn how to make bespoke shoes.  I had never in my life been so happy.  I discovered that I hate working for other people, hate it, absolutely hate it, I'd rather live on the street.<p>I got back and found a startup where I could make great money, knowing I would quit at the end of one year.  And like clockwork, after the initial enjoyment of doing something new, getting to write firmware which was something new, it was time to get out.  This time, knowing I was quitting made all the difference, I didn't get burned out.  I wasn't angry.  A couple months later an opportunity arose to do some consulting, 2 months in and I was set.  I doubled my income and got to walk away.  6 months later and the original manager quit, they needed someone to come in and rescue them, I showed up.  Charged twice what I've ever made.  The money was awesome, I paid off a second mortgage ($60k).  I saved $100k after tax.  After 8 months, couldn't take it anymore.<p>But this time I had a plan, it was time to start my own company, where I am the boss, where I can eventually get to the point where I hire other people to do all the work and I draw income from a business that doesn't consume my life.<p>I'm 2 months in on my first company product, it's hard work, but it doesn't feel like work.  I am my own boss, I decide what is important, I don't interrupt myself with stupid inefficient task switching, there are no office politics, I don't have to listen to the 'normies' and their pathetic existence as they skate through life anesthetized.<p>I love the uncertainty, I thrive on it.  To have a predictable mundane life is walking death.  To actually have complete control over my own success and failure is invigorating.  I have 22 months left of runway, and if it fails?  So what, I can always pick up a temporary consulting gig.  The experience I am learning now is making me far more valuable than being an employee ever will.<p>Some key things I learned, which made this possible:<p>1) eliminate anyone and everyone negative in my life: friends, family... anyone.<p>2) stop hanging around people who espouse and vigorously defend the ""normal"" lifestyle<p>3) surround myself with positive and also like minded individuals<p>4) take pleasure in simple things, cooking a good meal, reading an interesting book, going for a bike ride, accomplishing a small milestone.<p>5) Eliminate debt, do I really need that fancy car? (unless I can pay cash)<p>6) I got rid of my tv, don't miss it for a second, it just wastes my time<p>7) Got my living expenses down really low, yet I'm living the richest life I've ever had.<p>8) Free time to cook, allowed me to discover that I have a severe gluten intolerance.  Doctor's never figured it out, just told me I was ""depressed"", that I needed to eat more fiber (which is gluten).  Since I had eaten gluten almost every single meal my entire life there was no gap to discover how much better I felt.  This would never, ever have happened if I had kept a regular M-F job.  I never had time to cook semolina pizza dough, muffins, cakes and eat so much that the 1-1 correlation between what I was eating and how I felt clicked.<p>9) Don't fear change, embrace it<p>10) It's easy to make new friends<p>11) I'm actually an extrovert, it's the people I was surrounded with my whole life that made me seem like an introvert, I just didn't want to interact with them.<p>12) Stop caring what other people think, what makes them happy might make me miserable (one man's heaven is another man's hell)<p>13) Be happy so many people choose to take the easy way out, on cruise control.  It makes it so much easier to be successful myself with so little competition.<p>14) Be a source for anyone who is also trying to figure out who they are and what they really want to do.<p>15) Stop trying to give people advice when it is unwanted.<p>16) Life is about the journey, not the destination.  SOMEDAY STARTS NOW!<p>* anyone offended please feel free to skip my message, it's not for everyone.  My way is not for everyone, it is not a 'universal right way'.  But it is most definitely the right way for me, and for any lost souls out there (which I once was).  I hope that this post may make them think, think about how to change their life for the better too.",1354834968

If you check out their Crunchbase profile[1], they have already had some big exits with Groupon, Zynga, Skype and Instagram, which is quite impressive since they only started investing 3 years ago. I&#x27;m sure there have been some other medium/large M&A liquidity events as well but it usually takes 3-5 years to figure out if your VC portfolio is any good and 7+ years to realize any returns. LPs know this and funds usually have a 10 year life cycle, sometimes with options to extend it a year or two [2].<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/andreessen-horowitz/investments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/andreessen-horowitz/i...</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Venture-Deals-Smarter-Lawyer-Capitalist/dp/1118443616/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Venture-Deals-Smarter-Lawyer-Capitalis...</a>",1410116397

This may come, but before it is there, it&#x27;s not safe to navigate using these maps.<p>I also dislike that the line extending from the lighthouse sectors are not drawn, as that is very useful when navigating at night. They do have the intervals of the light houses, which is good. They also have a download function, which is important at sea, since you cannot expect to be online at all times at sea, but I did not get it to work. Since I&#x27;ve always used paper maps on sea, I can&#x27;t tell if they have the right download formats if it should work.<p>All in all it is a nice testbed for testing out concepts, but still not ready for prime time.

Is it possible that people who tend to participate in the rating of the looks of potential mates are more inclined to align with race? Not purely Latino men. Which is an enormous initial generalization to be making at the outset.<p><i>> Witness the actions of 35-year-old heterosexual men on OkCupid. These men typically search for women between the ages of 24 and 40, Mr. Rudder reports, yet in practice they rarely contact anyone over 29.</i><p>Again on this one, was age the only possible metric that caused the under 30 to be contacted more by 35 year old men? There isn&#x27;t anything else that might be different about an under 30 profile that causes more communication to occur?<p>This is the actual scary stuff to be publicly releasing as real science. Just as the general public is ill informed about the experiments going on, they are also not aware of what metrics are used to determine these results. In my experience, many of these metrics are not as concrete as the appear and full of pushing the data to fit a narrative etc.<p>Combine that with the fact that most of this data is proprietary and private with no way to be peer reviewed.

Newly recruited managers should do a couple of things to get up to speed.<p>1. Meet with all your direct reports, even if it&#x27;s 5 minutes, introduce themselves, ask what they&#x27;re working on, what the holds up are, etc. You&#x27;re leading them, make an effort to get to know them. (I&#x27;m a big fan of peopleware in this regard).<p>2. Take the time to read everything. A former boss of mine gave me this tip and said when you walk into a management role at a new place, your first job is to read everything and understand what&#x27;s going on. Reading the docs (business and technical) gives you insight into what&#x27;s going on and brings you up to speed.<p>3. Figure out the politics. Every office has them and the higher up you go, the more you have to play them.<p>4. Learn the tech stuff as needed. Understanding how team&#x27;s tools work helps you, as the manager, when it comes to cost/time estimates and understanding your team. Ramp up sessions explaining the processes behind major tools and the tradeoffs are valuable in this regard.<p>I disagree with brudgers that management is supposed to focus on management and not understand the technical side. If you&#x27;re managing tech people, the easiest way to understand how to smooth the path and get out of the way is to know which way things are going and how the tech works.<p>Management isn&#x27;t about micro controlling your people, whose got time for that? It is about understanding what they&#x27;re working on, running interference, and helping them develop towards their professional goals.<p>(Peopleware is a great book in this regard)",1410116127

In the past, quality journalists went to quality publications because the only place to find quality journalism was in a quality publication. Now, with people getting their articles from aggregators, social media and cross-linking, it&#x27;s no longer important what publication a writer writes for. A journalist for BuzzFeed can write (nearly) the same article they would for the New York Times, and (nearly) the same people (within the younger audience, at least) will be able to discover it. The publication is less relevant as an institution and a brand — BuzzFeed, HuffPo and the ilk are just investors and CMS&#x27;s for the work of individual writers.<p>Tl;dr: online news has been unbundled.",1410115619

8282007,comment,8269553,8270363,1,0,billmalarky,,,"I agree that they haven&#x27;t succeeded in removing their dependency on reddit, but you can tell it is certainly something on Alan&#x27;s mind.<p>I really don&#x27;t understand why they have taken steps that really limit the community for no real good reason. For example, comments are limited to 140 chars, which de facto means the discussion is going to be incredibly shallow. The only reason I can think of is maybe Alan was afraid of reddit thinking he was trying to steal their users and cutting him out entirely by creating their own image hosting solution, so he purposely limited imgur&#x27;s ability to develop its own community to not upset reddit stakeholders. (EDIT: It appears imgur has recently taken investment money from reddit, so now this threat is much less of a concern).<p>For example, why hasn&#x27;t imgur adopted a subreddit style model to help organize the content on the site? It&#x27;s a no brainer to help develop individual communities with actual focus instead of having one giant &quot;random&quot; feed. Anyone who argues that would be stealing an idea from reddit clearly hasn&#x27;t been to a forum before. All forum&#x27;s are divided by topic... except imgur.<p>|Most of users base browses the sites &quot;Viral&quot; gallery. Which is nothing more then a &quot;Reddit&#x27;s 24 hour greatest hits&quot;, a surprisingly low number of images make it into imgur&#x27;s gallery from imgur itself.<p>Additionally, using a subreddit approach would allow imgur to bridge the gap from &quot;reliance on reddit&quot; to all content coming from within the imgur community itself. That is, if imgur was to switch off content from reddit right now, the quality of the site&#x27;s content would plummet. User&#x27;s would be confused (as most it seems don&#x27;t actually understand where the content comes from) and there would honestly probably be a huge drop in the userbase. However, if they adopt a subreddit approach, with the first/main &quot;subimgur&quot; being &quot;viral&quot; which stays the exact same as it is now, then as the additional subimgurs that get created increase in quality they will naturally begin to take over more and more of the homepage allowing for a seamless transition away from reddit content to entirely imgur content.<p>Lastly, the layout of the site could use an upgrade in my opinion. I would prefer a hot ranked layout with full size images in descending order, basically reddit+RES with all images expanded, but with comments expandable under each post (or show top 3-5 comments under each post with clickable button to expand all -- or have the comments as a sidecar to each post when site is viewed on a desktop/tablet), which is a better user experience than having to click from image to image. Alan might be afraid that layout would kill their monetizable page views, since now they get a pageview per image where they can display a new ad. But the fact of the matter is, the impressions/pageview model of online advertising is dying fast. Using a feed instead of displaying one image at a time means imgur could integrate a native advertising solution, which pays much better than traditional display ads. If Alan is afraid of immediate drop in revenue that would come from transitioning to a new (though significantly better longterm) ad model, maybe it&#x27;s time for imgur to actually take in some investment capital that VCs are constantly trying to throw at it.<p>EDIT: It appears imgur has taken $40 MM in investment this year, I wasn&#x27;t aware of that.",1410115533

Generally the landscape of Scheme is quite a bit more fragmented than the CL landscape. The implementations can differ widely in their implemented language.

The approach we took was to keep all the UI completely native in the platform&#x27;s native language, and put only the networking/database/model logic in the shared code. This means that typically you only have to cross the bridging layer when you hit disk or network, which is already going to be heavily IO bound anyway.<p>I&#x27;ve heard of companies being successful using C# as the shared language, but in our case we wanted to distribute SDKs, so we picked C++ since it wouldn&#x27;t require us to include a runtime with the SDK.

In Common Lisp, you can rebind function symbols from a backtrace, and then carry on as if nothing happened. Changing a class definition updates every instance in the system to conform to that new definition, which makes interactive testing a joy. You can get hold of your namespaces as Lisp objects and interact with them as any other data structure, and see the effects reflected correctly in your runtime. CLOS is the peak of this sort of thing.

8281869,comment,8281511,8281511,2,0,fencepost,,,"A couple additional notes:<p>1. Many (most?) of the servers running with Bukkit also had some form of payment for items, skills, ranks, etc. that can affect game play, also known as &quot;pay-to-win.&quot; Mojang recently announced that they were going to be cracking down on this since it&#x27;s a violation of the license, though I don&#x27;t know what if any enforcement has actually happened. Enforcement was due to start August 1.<p>2. Mojang has a couple of multiplayer options without Bukkit - the Minecraft Server piece that is part of this discussion and Minecraft Realms. If Bukkit is dead (which may be the case no matter what happens because W. is not the only outside developer who could pull this kind of stunt), there are still multiplayer options and Mojang could likely implement some of the features currently in Bukkit but under their control - perhaps under a licensing model that lets them sell the server software as well.<p>Basically this guy has managed to shut down something being used by folks with business practices that Mojang was already having some issues with, while leaving available some less feature-rich options fully approved (and controlled by) Mojang. The odds of that resulting in their giving in and open-sourcing something that&#x27;s included in Minecraft as a whole are somewhere around nil - worst case for Mojang is that the Minecraft server community that they&#x27;re not a direct part of takes a feature and popularity hit for some time while they get to point at this guy as the reason why.",1410113033

On further reflection, I have nothing but anger for the way Mojang has handled this situation. Even though they claim that they &quot;own Bukkit outright&quot;, completely devaluing the many, many, many community contributions made, they continue to refuse to support the project in even the most trivial ways, and I have nothing but respect for many of the community leaders they&#x27;ve driven away, including @mbaxter, @EvilSeph, @amaranth and many more. Mojang is absolutely to blame for this, no matter how childish Wolverness&#x27; behavior may be. I&#x27;ve left my original comment below, to give some context on the complexities of the situation, but I can maybe understand where Wolverness is coming from at this point.<p>This is my perspective as someone who was once inside of the Bukkit community as an outside developer (not one of the core team), but Wolverness has been a very toxic maintainer of the project, especially as it regards to responding to pull requests. Either your code complies 100% with the contributing guidelines (including confusingly written and sometimes unwritten rules about spacing, formatting, naming and pull request formatting) or it gets rejected out of hand. Any mention of forks of the Bukkit project (such as Spigot, Glowstone or SportBukkit) could get you banned from IRC, the forums and your comments deleted on Github. This upon many, many instances of just caustic behaviors and treatment of interested developers and contributors.<p>I&#x27;m still subscribed to the projects on Github, and I was never burned by these rules personally (so these feelings are not out of spite--they&#x27;re out of sorrow for the developers who were turned away) but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever have a chance of getting any non-trivial PR integrated into the project. The standards were just too insane. I&#x27;m no fan of how Mojang has been handling the minecraft community recently, but anything that would drive this guy out is just fine by me.<p>(This takedown is BS btw. CraftBukkit has ALWAYS linked against the minecraft official server library--a release of CB made by a Mojang employee doesn&#x27;t change ANYTHING about the GPL status of Minecraft. Note that the proprietary minecraft server DOESN&#x27;T link against in any way shape or form)",1410112962

There are a number of really high valuation companies, though, which are mostly based on the last round funding, often led by a16z. Now, a natural question is who exactly is benefiting from the high valuation? OK, certainly not the employees as most of them are not vested, and even if they have, they can&#x27;t sell to anyone, and there is no cash dividend. The founders and top management sometimes can negotiate a better deals financially in these funding rounds [2], and in general can be resume boosters for them, so they do benefit somewhat from the high valuation. The LPs are not exactly getting anything at this time as the gain is not realized yet. That leaves the VCs who have a huge incentives to lead big rounds, as their incomes are proportional to the size of the funds they raise from LPs as detailed in this HBR article [3].

2890789,comment,2889739,2889739,1,0,700ravens,,,"What this author considers a novel, future direction for science is something that I call ""going to work in the morning.""  The US Department of Energy operates many user facilities distributed around the country, including nanotechnology centers, electron microscopy centers, neutron facilities, and X-ray facilities.  (I run an instrument at one of the X-ray facilities.)  Access to these facilities is free to the user and available through a peer-reviewed proposal system.  In many cases, these facilities provide access to equipment and experimental techniques that don't exist at individual institutions.  In some cases (notably at the nano-centers) capabilities are provided that might be available at a university or a company, but the nano-center provides access to a very broad suite of instrumentation as well as access to expert staff.  While there might be a concern that the proposal system would cater to insiders (as one commenter discussing CERN suggests below), that is not my experience.  I regularly have new folks coming to use my instrument.<p>My caveat here is that my field is in the physical sciences, while the author works in the life sciences.  The user facility concept is specialty of the DoE and, while DoE user facilities do serve many life science users, it grew out of a physical sciences funding agency.  Still, the user facility concept works well and is a model that could address the sort of distributed yet collaborative science that the author describes.",1313495838

The more you treat parts of your experiments as black-boxes done by someone else, the more likely it is you might misunderstand some details of what exactly is happening, and draw the wrong conclusions. It requires the abstraction boundaries being <i>very</i> good, anyway, so that nothing gets changed at one level that actually impacts another level's results, without the sides communicating. If it's the same people, or at least people who see each other daily in the same lab, they're much more likely to notice that a ""minor"" change in a detail is actually experimentally relevant, due to how the result will be used somewhere else, or assumptions about the process that were baked into an equation, or something along those lines.<p>Even in a field like CS this happens a lot; tons of benchmarks are screwed up or at least misleadingly reported because someone didn't 100% understand the entire stack on which their part was running, and what its implications were for their results.",1313494078

That said, technology leaders have to eventually overcome the introspection that made them successful in the first place.<p>It is easy to see how some of the greats in the tech industry do it.  Look at Ron Conway - he is a perpetual networker, and one of the highest impact people around.  Steve Jobs is another, creating his famous reality distortion field.  Look at Demo Day - isn't this the culmination of a lot of networking on top of great product work?<p>One of the interesting aspects of social networking theory is that it is the people more removed from us who can help us the most.  The people we are tightly linked to don't know that many people that we don't.  The folks less tightly linked have the incremental connections we can't access ourselves.<p>Coffee anyone?",1313493857

2890684,comment,2890397,2890596,23,0,blub,,,"The biggest problem I have with GIMP is that it's not intuitive. Every time I open it I have to stop and think how I am supposed to do what I am trying to do, my work never flows.\nThis has such an impact on my productivity that I'm desperately looking for alternatives that don't involve purchasing Photoshop - now looking at Pixelmator. Other members of the team have switched to Paint.NET or other simple editors, but they are too simple for me.<p>Another problem that I have is with focus - sometimes the picture window loses input focus to one of the tool windows and then the keyboard shortcuts stop working. I have to click on the window and then use the shortcut, but when clicking the current tool will execute its action (such as paint a black blob in the middle of the layer), so I have to click outside the picture area (might be hard to do) or hunt for the title bar.\nFurthermore, when the tool windows have focus they control some of the widgets in the tool window, popping up subwindows or changing settings by accident.<p>Yet another issue is text editing and selection. GIMP does not allow me to do live text-editing, instead it pops up a dialog box and I have to adjust the actual text rect in the background. Every time I click the text rect to adjust it the tool windows flicker into view for 0.5 seconds, very annoying. Selections are significantly harder to control compared to Photoshop, where you can do pretty much <i>anything</i> to a selection just by using the mouse and one or two keys.<p>General UI problems:<p>* dialogs that are too small<p>* dialogs popping up over other dialogs<p>* many dialogs that cover the image when shown and I have to move them out of the way<p>* dialogs that sometimes remember their position, sometimes show up at apparently random locations<p>* tool windows exiting the screen<p>* tool fields that just look like they were thrown together without any thought to spacing, grouping and alignment (check out the rectangle select or the almost invisible spinner arrows for the layer transparency)<p>* the layers tool window is especially difficult to use with a mouse (dragging & dropping, ordering, linking)<p>* tools that reset their settings (e.g: move tool rests to pick a layer to move instead of move active)<p>* general disregard for UI design that makes the UI look crowded (e.g layers tab icons)<p>* the design choice of clipping layers to the visible image area, forcing you to resize the canvas and the layers unnecessarily<p>I could go on and on and on. I can't remember using GIMP even once without being annoyed by something in the UI that breaks my work flow.<p>The features I miss the most are adjustments layers, layer grouping (this is so painful when working with a lot of layers).",1313492537

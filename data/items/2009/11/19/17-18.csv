They use an open source framework that I've contributed to, a language I'm advanced with, and it sounds like a killer opportunity to buck the cog-in-a-wheel machine.<p>They are in stealth and haven't pursued venture capital yet, they want to build the product to a Beta release before seeking out funding.

These men--poets, mostly, or at least advocates of the form--saw the confines of the newspaper column as a reduction of writing proper, where writing (in their strict poetic sense) necessitated a careful consideration of the placement of each word on the page.<p>The same considerations can well be applied to blogging, at least on an abstract formal level. You're very right: it all falls apart if there's not ample content to back up a thoughtful design. But it is probably still the case that while a great design may do little for mediocre writing, great writing can be held back by mediocre design.",1258652660

What is kind of interesting is that when you look at the results closely you can see what is really being measured - client interface speed.  Simply put, there is no way that a tokyo tyrant hash database and a memcached instance should run at the same speed.  The former is writing to disk while the latter is not.  This means that the bottleneck here is not the cache being ""compared"", but the client interface code.<p>If I had the time I would rewrite the client code to use the pytyrant interface talking to an in-memory tyrant hash database to see where things really stack up.<p>EDIT: If anyone wants to run the benchmarks, just replace the import of memcache in tokyo.py with an import of pytyrant, then replace the run loop with:<p><pre><code>    t = pytyrant.PyTyrant.open('10.90.15.96', 1978)\n    hashval = md5(str(self.c) + str(i)).hexdigest()\n    if self.gs == 'set':\n        t[hashval] = hashval\n    else:\n        t[hashval]</code></pre>",1258652623

950609,comment,949044,949262,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I'm a writer (not a novelist, yet) and from what I've learned from the people I've talked to is simple. #1 is that they write out of a passion (myself included) and that they'll do it regardless of money, so the complaints about the grossly low pay becomes somewhat dubious when many writers still work day jobs for the majority of their career. One of my extended family was a semi-pro golfer, he had notorious low pay from it (even professionals doing the full circuit don't get amazing pay, it's the endorsements that pay well), but he works in banking so his day job pays <i>a lot</i> so he gets to do what he loves (golf) <i>a lot</i>.<p>#2 is that the genre you choose can seriously affect how much you get paid. Vampire-Romance is 99% of the time YA, which is predominantly read by young-female readers, many of whom may be transients in the market. This might be your ideal literary area, however this isn't a mountain of gold waiting for people with pickaxes to come claim it, this is a stream with a dozen people with sifters already there.<p>I'm working on a Fantasy series, which if I'm lucky on a NYT best seller list might pull me in above $25,000 due to its target market being well established and adult readers (IE people who'll buy hardback). However, I'm a realist and I quickly realised that Mystery novels have <i>the</i> biggest literary market and pay their authors the most of any. Writing a pulp mystery novel could likely bring in $25,000 for a single book (likely very few royalties, but that's beside the point here), hitting a best seller list for mystery (especially a multi-book deal) would easily bring in the big cash and could work as your day job.<p>The authors own efforts also contribute, many authors believe that their only job is putting pen to paper (or finger to keyboard), which is well within their rights. However many authors do vast marketing and meet-and-greets, signings and such to help boost word of mouth of themselves, not their books. A good example here is John Scalzi, who is constantly in contact with his fans and does extensive convention runs. This kind of self-marketing is how many webcomics became profitable and allowed their artists to become full time at it relying solely on advertisements.<p>Edit: Note on the genre front. Many NYT Best Sellers hit the front page on Hard Cover (where the author makes a greater percentage of royalties, but also the book sells for 2/3 times the paperback price), especially mystery novels. However YA <i>never</i> hits the list in hard cover, many are rarely ever released in hard cover. Not selling hard cover books well will easily 1/2 or 1/3 your pay and typically the older reader spends more on their books and will buy hard cover.",1258651659

950584,comment,950400,950400,0,0,kailashbadu,,,"I am from PHP background and here is the lowdown of how I worked my way from basic PHP security to advanced web application security (language-independent). I am sure it will help you in making a decision for yourself.\n1. Essential PHP Security by Chris Shiflett: a light read with little over 100 pages. PHP often picks a lot of flak for being insecure. However, in majority of cases its not because of the flaws in PHP platform itself. It’s because of the certain design choices PHP made which makes it easier for a novice developer to mistakenly write insecure code. Given a little care, these mistakes can be easily avoided. All basic security stuffs are covered like forms and urls, sql injection, session and cookie security. The concept covered in this book can easily be applied for other platforms but apparently you don’t want any of these information because you already are well-versed in them.<p>2. Pro PHP Security by Chris Synder and Michael Southwell: Covers most of what you are looking for, namely, perils of shared hosting, safe development practices, Encryption, SSL and SSH, HTTP and HTTPS, Access Control and Authentication. Of course the book is inclined towards PHP but most of the concepts are language neutral and you can easily extrapolate these concepts to another language of your choice.<p>3. Foundation of Security by Neil Daswani et al.: The blurb on the first page speaks for itself <i>What every programmer needs to know about security with running examples of web applications and stories of what’s gone wrong in the past</i>. Mostly language neutral but sample codes are implementation in Java. Comprehensive. Recommended.<p>4.

218462,comment,218425,218425,0,0,demallien,,,"I can see what the author is trying to get at.  If you are talking about building a library with an API, or maybe even a command line tool, then what he says has quite a bit of wisdom to it.<p>Unfortunately for the author, industry's long experience with GUI apps indicates that MVC is the way to go - when I consider the frameworks that I use for writing UIs, the two that most clearly give me an MVC architecture (Cocoa and Rails), are easily the most productive frameworks that I use.<p>This comes into conflict with the original article when you consider the M of MVC.  A Model makes no sense at all without getters and setters.  It's job is mostly to handle serialisation of data - either to a database using ORM (ActiveRecord), or to a file using something like Cocoa's NSCoding protocol.  It may even be used for serialising data to be sent over the network.<p>Regardless, if the UI can't get it's hands on the data, the data is useless.  So how can we get the data to the UI.  If you look in the comments section of the article, the autor suggests (in responding to a question for how to populate a pull-down menu list) that you create a method in the model class that takes a pull-down menu as a parameter, and then populates the menu.  No!  Models should never even know what a pull-down menu is!  How can I re-use my model code elsewhere if it is tied to a GUI.<p>Again, going back to ActiveRecord.  I can create a model class inheriting from ActiveRecord, and re-use exactly the same class in a RubyCocoa app, or a Rails app.  How am I supposed to do that if my model class starts spitting out html, or starts calling NSArrayControllers?<p>No.  If the author is right, then MVC must be wrong, and quite frankly I don't think that he has presented a strong enough case to justify one of the more successful architectural choices that we as an industry have found over the last 50 odd years.",1213599257

I'm assuming one _can_ exist. I think I have an idea on how to make it work; I just don't have a forum to test it on, yet.",1213598997

218459,comment,218016,218016,0,0,philbutler,,,"I find it fascinating that a tool or startup (no matter how innovative) that is utilized by only 6000 or so Web sites gets so much attention when:<p>Haloscan, JS-Kit, Sezwho and a score of others dominate this niche.<p>JS-Kit alone is used by over 50,000 sites and reaches in excess of 20 million people<p>The entity in question has a nebulous monetization model<p>This same platform so far has no revenue sharing for publishers<p>And most importantly Disqus has no viable way to allow publishers benefit from their own content's SEO aspect when their content will reside on Disqus servers.<p>Disqus is a refined commenting system that in my opinion is designed to be sold to a brand rather than taken to its natural conclusion by Daniel and his team. This is the only logical reason for there not being a monetization or business model in place (or at least in view) and for apparently pirating massive SEO benefit from published comments (Google might like this, or any business that can derive such an SEO bonanza).<p>It is in Fred Wilson's benefit to see that the world thinks a comment system will replace Google, and this is why you see such assertions (he is in on the investment). I on the other hand represent JS-Kit and have an interest too. So, I suggest you do your investigating and see what the story is for yourselves.<p>I was one of the first to review Disqus when it arrived om the scene - a great platform and a bright developer. At the time I did not know of any flaws however. These flaws appear to reside in the intentions of the startup toward content, its owners and transparency in my view. Perhaps you should ask the question: ""Show me the money"" a little more forcefully?",1213598503

218456,comment,217914,218232,0,0,einarvollset,,,"Don't get me wrong, I don't think SMS on a truly large scale is trivial. I do, however, think SMS messaging is fundamentally different to what Twitter is doing. The former is unicast: I send you a message. It needs to be stored somewhere (your SMS inbox). Twitter is multicast: I send a message, everyone who subscribe to me needs to get that message.<p>Now, misunderstand me correctly; I don't think this is anything new. My former boss  built tools (over 20 years ago) that ran such systems as the NYSE, Swiss Air-traffic control, etc that did fault-tolerant multicast. And the uptime there was somewhat better than Twitter.<p>What led me to post the original comment was this: They are not solving the same problem, but if they were their architecture would be just as flawed as Twitter's.",1213598378

218447,comment,218425,218425,0,0,ardit33,,,"Getters and Setters are ok in Java, but not in python.  Java compilers are smart enough to optimize, and inline if a getter and setter has no side effects.<p>But while it is good to avoid them, sometimes it is impossible.<p>Consider this pseucode, a simple scenario, when starting a video, if the default volume is too loud, I want to reduce it somewhere in the middle.:<p>....<p>videoPlayer.play(""myvideo.mpg"")<p>int vol = videoPlayer.getVolume()<p>if ( vol > 50 ) {<p><pre><code>    videoPlayer.setVolume(50)
</code></pre>
}<p>Getters and setters make perfect sense.<p>Avoiding them is good, but I really don't trust people that scream ""Getters and setters are evil"".  No, they are not.  They have their place, but as everything they should not be overused.  
But in terms of bad software design, if somebody overused them and exposed things should be exposed, they are pretty begnin, not even close to Dr. Evil evil,  more like mini-me evil.",1213596912

I'm having a blast now, but I get the impression I won't look back after beating it.<p>In many ways, this sci-fi, shooting, dungeon-crawling RPG reminds me of ""Virus Hunter,"" a walk-through example used in the Game Design program of ""Cybercamp,"" which I enrolled in when I was 10. Is there some common inspiration I'm not familiar with? I highly doubt Virus Hunter had much originality...<p>As a comic side-note, I initially thought the Light weapons meant they fired light as their projectile.<p>P.S.: I must compliment the decision to jump straight from one mission to the next. I initially told myself I'd stop after beating mission 1, but, with the game offering no natural breaking point (e.g.: ""Congratulations! Save and continue?"" or some other kind of pop-up exposition or prompt -- an analogous phenomenon: it's easier to put down a book between chapters than one paragraph into the next chapter) , I found myself telling myself ""I'll stop after beating this mission."" As mission 3 rolled around, I found it hard to force myself to quit. It's the game designer's job to get the players addicted, and you certainly succeeded there!",1213596180

It's scary if someone builds software out of their messy work-area and releases it for ""production"", instead of using a clean tree in the middle of nowhere.  It's just too easy to forget to check something in that matters.",1213596006

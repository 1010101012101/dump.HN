I bet if you were giving away CDs outside of the mall and charged $0.25, people wouldn't think twice about tossing a quarter into the can.

3069572,comment,3069299,3069299,10,0,decklin,,,"I pirated some music today[0]. I went to my usual shops to try to buy it, and for some reason the label had explicitly decided not to offer downloads of any sort. Just vinyl and CD. I wanted it now, and I couldn't really be arsed with those choices, so I stole it.<p>What would an honest Android-app allegory for this be? Perhaps a consumer is faced with these options:<p>1. An official shop, which accepts money (yay!), gives only some (boo!) of it to the artist, and offers:<p>a. The source code to build the app (i.e. a plastic disc that you have to rip yourself)<p>b. maybe, sometimes, a version of the app compiled for a 320x480 screen (acceptable lossy compressed files)<p>c. maybe, even fewer times, a version of the app compiled to use any screen size (lossless files, or high-quality lossy or whatever you like)<p>2. A dodgy (boo!) pirate site, which doesn't accept money (boo!), and offers all of the compiled versions.<p>Of course this is not even close to reality. No Android apps are compiled by normal end users. All paid Android apps offer 1c. Music piracy does not exist because of religious ""information must be free"" nuts like this article is talking about -- it exists because people's moral feeling about getting some money to the artist is not strong enough to overcome the inconvenience of 1a (or even 1b). Maybe we should conclude that the analogy has broken down.<p>Society does not ""accept"" this sort of piracy like it's a binary switch. The ""morals"" curve slides down, the ""inconvenience"" curve slides up, and at some point they pass each other. I see no reason why they can't trade places again -- if we actually try to do something about it instead of spinning clever allegories.<p>I suspect we need to look elsewhere to understand the motivations of app pirates (yes, I know this was not the point, but if you're going to be facetious...). The real thing is right there, for a few dollars. I've already given Google Checkout my credit card information. I cannot fathom what would make someone deal with sketchy sites (sketchy sites whose entire purpose is to <i>install executable code on your device</i>) to get the same thing they can just pay for. Maybe they are in fact just religious nuts.<p>[0] Honestly, I can't even be bothered to pirate most things these days. I'm culturally behind because filling in the gaps in what I can actually buy in FLAC would be a part-time job. If a record shop so much as rejects spaces in my credit card number I get bored and go listen to something I've already bought. This is a problem that could use some, as they say, disruptive innovation.",1317707251

3069564,comment,3062472,3063259,2,0,glyph,,,"There's plenty not to like about JavaScript, but the biggest mess is this:<p>js> x = 1\n1\njs> z = x.y\njs> // WTF??<p>In other words: it's not an error to access an attribute of an object which isn't there.  It's dicey enough that you can have attributes in Python and Ruby that can be misspelled, and mismatch their declarations, without an immediate compiler error.  But, that is reasonable to deal with as long as you have pretty good unit test coverage: after all, if you run the code that is actually accessing the attribute, you'll quickly see that there's a run-time error and fix it:<p>irb(main):001:0> x = 1\n=> 1\nirb(main):002:0> z = x.y\nNoMethodError: undefined method `y' for 1:Fixnum\n	from (irb):2<p>~or~<p>>>> x = 1\n>>> z = x.y\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>\nAttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'y'<p>... and you need unit test coverage <i>anyway</i>, because the compiler can't save you from a huge variety of other violations, so it's not like this is really making much extra work for you.<p>In JavaScript, by the time you actually encounter an error, it's too late to figure out where the heck the erroneous object is getting generated.  So, if you have some code like 'this.observers.push(object.somefunc);', every test case which adds an observer must also verify what happens when the observer gets called: and it has to be <i>the same test</i> so you have some idea where the observer came from, whereas you can easily make those things different tests in Python.<p>Then, in order to get reasonable error-reporting behavior from quick things which aren't tested, you have to have tons of manual type-checks anywhere that objects are put into a persistent container, because by the time you have some random 'undefined' in your list of observers, it's far too late to figure out how it got there.<p>This type of paranoid defensive programming is a bad idea in Python and Ruby, because you can just let the language runtime do its job and inform you if there's an error, and your stacktraces will give you a good idea where it is.<p>The fact that sometimes unknown things are 'undefined' and sometimes they're 'null' and sometimes they're '""undefined""' and sometimes they're the empty string and sometimes they're 0 really compounds this problem.  Python has None, Ruby has nil, and nobody uses random ad-hoc sentinel values because why would you do that?<p>The thing that just blows my mind is that the designers of JavaScript must have _known_ that this was a terrible idea, because:<p>js> undefined.undefined\ntypein:1: TypeError: undefined has no properties\njs> null.nothing       \ntypein:2: TypeError: null has no properties<p>so when you are <i>two</i> steps out from the misspelling that caused your error, you can figure out that something has in fact gone wrong.  And:<p>js> blub\ntypein:3: ReferenceError: blub is not defined<p>since the assumption that everything you <i>really</i> care about in JavaScript is going to be a global variable, and prototype attributes are kind of an afterthought.  After all, why would you store data in organized structures when you can just stuff it all into an undifferentiated bag of crap in the global namespace!  It's all going to go away when you reload the page, right?<p>Except then Node comes along and changes the equation so you actually have to live with your persistent data structures and you probably want to know when things go wrong in your long-running servers.  Oops.<p>Here I really have to agree with Ted: despite the fact that there are advantages to be had from keeping your client and your server in the same language and leveraging your investment in utility libraries in both places, JavaScript really is bad enough language that it's worth the effort to use something different when you can.",1317706996

You wouldn't think it walking about Roppongi or China Town but it is.<p>This comes into play when renting too.  The real estate agent usually requires someone Japanese to sponsor you.

The closer to Tokyo, the less space, the more rent.<p>Anything involving services will seem overpriced.

Currency codes that aren't associated with countries typically start with an ""X"". For example, ""XAU"" is a troy ounce of gold, and ""XBA"" is for European Composite Unit. Unfortunately, ""XBC"" is used for European Unit of Account 9, but they could do something like ""XBT"" or ""XCN"" for BitCoin.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217</a>",1352732389

I find there are two main obstacles to reducing my paid ""work"" load.<p>1.  I currently rely on contract work, and I find that I don't have contacts that want to employ a contractor for 20-30 hours a week, or even a set of contractors who want to employ for a combined 20-30 hours a week.  Usually when people hire contractors, they want something done as soon as possible, without distractions.<p>To obtain my desired work hours per week, I will have to greatly extend my contacts list.  Which I should do anyway, but it won't happen overnight.<p>2.  Health insurance.  I have mild schizophrenia which, untreated, makes it hard for me to reason logically.  With the proper medication and care I remain gainfully employed as a dev/sysadmin/devops role.  On top of that I have Tourette syndrome.<p>Insurance for anyone with these kinds of pre-existing conditions is expensive; laws changed such that very soon they won't be able to _deny_ it to me, but they can price it as high as they like.  Despite having substantial savings, long periods of not having any income is out of the question for me.  Therefore, either traditional corporate employment, or full-time contract work at a high enough wage to pay for high-quality insurance, are the way to go.<p>I don't mention these things in a ""waaaa, waaaaa, I'm so helpless"" way--far from it.  I've attained more than the average person in my career, in terms of skills and pay.<p>Rather, I think people on this site forget sometimes that not everyone is suited to risk it all on a startup, and not everyone is cut out to be an entrepreneur, and not everyone has to be an A+++++ level developer to get by, and it's not a sin to seek some stability.",1352731771

Badly structured tests are worse than no tests to the extent that it's often cheaper to throw the lot away and write new tests - turning what should have been a simple ""change the class hierarchy without changing the public interface"" into ""oh god every single test relied on the detail of the class hierarchy"". No, they SHOULDN'T have. But they DID. And I get to fix it. Again. A particular anti-pattern I am observing right now is the ""immutable interface, mutable implementation"" approach. Every single test in 6 different sub-projects appears to want to create ""special snowflakes"" for testing, but was written to mutate an implementation which no longer exists. Days of extra work needed to figure out what the intent of the test was (no comments, because tests are self documenting, right? Sure they are.) and then re-write it using builder interfaces in the hope that this will save some poor sod (probably me) the trouble the second/third/fourth rewrite.<p>Be a better damn developer.

I expect that most companies that put up job postings are looking for someone now though. While there are a few larger companies that hire students in advance (like Microsoft and Google), I wonder if I'm wasting my time by applying for jobs now. I've also been somewhat picky in the job that I want, I feel that I'd rather work somewhere that I can grow in an area I'm interested in, rather than just get a job for the sake of earning money.<p>I believe getting work doing something I enjoy, and growing through work experience would be optimal for my future, but I've even thought of attempting freelance work just to ensure I'm doing what I want to do after I graduate (which I haven't even really narrowed down yet, more so I know what I don't want to do). I wonder if I would be better off just getting a job anywhere I can, but worry that it will not lead me down a path I would be happy with. Perhaps I'm naive thinking that I can get everything I want after finishing University, but at the same time I feel that it's an achievable goal and I'd like to set myself up as best as possible to grow. I'm not opposed to moving pretty much anywhere in North America, and am not too concerned about my salary either (within reason).<p>Any advice for me, HN?",1352731252

1. The interface is extremely easy to use if you stop trying to use it like Windows 95, which seems to be the world you are stuck in.
2.The lock screen fails to tell you to do next, because anyone who has ever interacted with a computer knows to press a key or click when they encounter a locked interface. Not just phones, thinks screensavers. If this is a confusing concept, you should retire.
3. Touch is not required, so I'm not so sure why this guy is so angry about the addition of a way to interact.
4.""OMFG!!!!! cloud connected apps require an account!!!! and I have to use them!!!!"" Again, just because a thing exists does not mean you have to use it. If you have a different application, install it. 
5.Closing Start menu apps took about 5 seconds to figure out without wasting a page on instructions. EX: ""Oh, when i move my mouse to the left a recent apps thing pops up... and to the right I get a control Menu. I wonder what happens when i put my mouse on the top of the screen? Oh a hand, I can move this around and pull it down to close!""  Seems like maybe you NEED a beginner interface guy, ever heard of curiosity?
6. ""I don't want to memorize key commands!!!! I don't want a touch interface!!!! keyboards are dumb!!!! MOUSE ONLY FOREVER!!!"" Apparently the only acceptable interface to this guy is a mouse, he refuses to learn keyboard shortcuts(that are in every version of windows btw, so maybe NOT learning them is the actual waste of energy) 
7. The had to rename it because of a lawsuit.
8. The next several pages are just bitching about how the past was different and how there is no start menu, even though you've spent the previous pages talking about how its all that exists now, and how Linux won't work because he watches Fox News or something. 
In conclusion, according to a guy who has a website that looks like it was on GeoCities, the Windows 8 interface is both designed for children, but also too complicated for him. He needs to do real work, so much in fact that he only interacts with the user interface and makes no mention of the underlying improvements to the operating system. He laments having to use the start page to access all of the apps that he can now access from just the start page. He is so mad that you can now use touch in addition to mouse and keyboards, but is furious that he should know how to use the keyboard, and that he often has to move the mouse(even to the side OF THE SCREEN SOMETIMES! Can you believe that shit?)<p>Also, that pain in your leg, may be an embolism or deep vein thrombosis.

If some part of Gnome needs a system service, it requests it via dbus and parses the response. How that service is delivered ought to be irrelevant.<p>Since systemd <i>is</i> supposed to offer all its services via dbus, is the problem really ""we don't want to implement all these services that a modern desktop needs"". OpenBSD et al could offer a dbus layer that implements the same set of services, but they don't want (or have the manpower) to do so. In which case, I'm not really sure they have a leg to stand on: the things systemd offers really are important for a modern well integrated desktop (or any other system for that matter) and they weren't well served by initscripts. OpenBSD is free to implement a service that offers the same dbus interfaces whenever they want, but complaining about Linuxisms is perhaps a little rich: if you want your system to remain stuck in the early 1990s then that's fine, but you can't really expect the rest of the world to hang around waiting for you to catch up.",1352730128

4772887,comment,4771879,4772477,2,0,yebyen,,,"Thought I would chime in, because I've had a fair amount of experience with this and it's basically a battleground... if you try just once to install a reasonable Linux on your android transformer, you might get the wrong idea and believe that Android Linux is just not usable.<p>My favorite configuration on my TF-101 is TeamEOS nightly builds with a separate partition for Ubuntu Precise which I run without X11.  The partitioning can be accomplished using OLiFE Prime (don't mind that you may not have the TF Prime, that's not what prime means here.)<p>There are various APKs that will let you install Linux from several (mostly debian-based) distros into a chroot, by mounting a loopback file.  I had good luck with ""Debian Kit"" and my current install of Ubuntu is older than my current install of Android, so I can't tell you exactly how I got it installed, but if you're not familiar with the chroot method of installing Linux, there are several different market apps with the goal of making it easy for you.<p>I found it's best to forego any X11 stuff.  You wanted Linux so you could run a terminal, apt-get, and compile software?  You got it.  Android Terminal Emulator supports the control key, shift, and ""back"" for escape, it's perfectly usable.<p>That all works OK, but you have to take some care to get the armhf (not armel) versions installed, they work great and are much faster.  You can also ignore that.  I have read that they are much faster but I don't have empirical evidence to support that.  ""Feels true""<p>Finally for end of the 2 minute elevator pitch for Android Linux, as soon as you try using something that requires SYSV IPC, you will probably find it doesn't work (that means Apache, MySQL, basically any kind of multi-process server), unless your kernel mastery far outstrips my own, or if you settled on AOKP instead of EOS build of Android.  The AOKP builds I tried _do_ support SYSV IPC.  But nobody else does.<p>I did manage to enable X11 once by OLiFE installer, the system I installed was a ""natty"" at least two generations old, it worked fine out of the box from OLiFE, but it was kludgy at best, I tried upgrading everything to oneiric and precise, and from then on nothing worked.  I did not want to lose my Android notifications backbone, so I went back.<p>I do everything in a chroot now.<p>Don't get me wrong.  It worked.  I just don't see the point of having a touch screen on a system that was engineered for a mouse and keyboard first.  So, tl;dr, you can most certainly get a full working Linux terminal on Android JellyBean, I have... it's possible to install rvm in the usual way, and if you are a vim user, you'll be wanting that escape key, don't forget to set the options correctly in the Android Terminal Emulator app.",1352729832

In the past, others have suggested using the time between jobs for this - but (in the US at least) you'd still need to pay into COBRA if you wanted your health insurance to continue during that time. Also, having worked through the dot-com period at the beginning of the last decade, I'm always a little cautious about assuming that it will be easy to land the next gig.",1352729302

I found myself having tons of slightly overlapping windows, and that I was using the mouse too much to rearrange and move them. There are other ""solutions"" to this problem, but tiling seemed like the right one for me.<p>Tiling allows me to quickly max/min windows, quickly change desktops, and layout the apps I want. Is it the one true way? No. There are others means to that end.<p>If you are referring to my video of clocks, that was a test case for 4 monitor support.  Yes xclock looks horrible in tiled fashion, but it is an app that tends to be installed so and thus gets used in tests.<p>I use kde apps in qtile all the time. It is just a wm and can replace metacity or kdewin if you please.<p>YMMV and you should use what you feel most productive in. I used KDE for years, then Awesome, and preferred hacking qtile in Python rather than Awesome's Lua.",1352729273

For example, if you have six boolean inputs, you have 2^6=64 possible combinations.<p>If you have six <i>integer</i> inputs, you have roughly (4e9)^6=4e57 combinations, which is more than the number of atoms in the Earth.<p>Expressing your intention means that when you (or someone else) come back to the code to change it, you can at least have an awareness of whether the behaviour you are seeing is in line with what you intended. Because a bug might not even be a bug - in that code - but a misuse of a method for something it wasn't meant to do.",1352729241

Dual mandates are really dangerous for bureaucracies -- the federal reserve has a similarly conflicted dual mandate of price stability and employment, no as a result it behaves a bit like a highly medicated insane person at times.  NSA does the same thing -- releasing SELinux and trying to prevent the spread of encryption in protocols and operating systems simultaneously.",1343462148

I mean, the GNOME 3 shell overview is basically Mission Control from Lion - but we designed it in 2008, well before Lion screenshots were released or leaked to the press; who copied who? ;-)<p>competing with Apple is also a false goal; we want to keep the keep the users free, as well as providing them tools and an environment that allows them to achieve their goals in a simple and delightful way. that will put us up against Apple, and Microsoft, and Samsung, and basically everyone. it never stopped us for the past 15 years, I don't think it will stop us now.",1343461978

That should still be smaller than what the government devotes to that task now, but at the NSA level, I get the feeling that most dollars and head count is not going to defense.<p>I think it is a legitimate question how much of an offensive information warfare standing capability a country needs when not at war, and what level of dirty tricks intelligence agencies should pull in peacetime to monitor adversaries. Particularly due to the non financial costs of this monitoring -- losing our moral standing as a free and fair country, incidentally monitoring citizens or those present in the USA, in violation of the constitution (especially due to the tortured ""five eyes"" sharing agreements, which, if they weren't governments, would be viewed as a conspiracy and some kind of constructive crime), etc.  I judge all of this stuff by ""does it make us safer"", and at some point, it clearly goes the other way.

Was the point to solve the problem with as little work as possible? If that's the case, there's probably some plugin for your favorite text editor that already does this. So what?

You could just have easily built a library function that does all of this and then write a Pascal program that calls the library in one line of code, state the library is not part of your solution, and say the solution is better than the one with UNIX utilities. So what? Is the point to illustrate that Knuth is unaware of elementary concepts such as code reuse, come on that is just sort of ridiculous.<p>If you had asked Knuth to solve this problem using any means  in the whole world and do it within 10 minutes, I don't think he would have any trouble doing it.<p>And honestly, if the lesson is to teach us some really basic lesson of code reuse, not reinventing the wheel, or some such like that, I think this was a pretty convoluted way to deliver sort of a common sense lesson.",1343461424

I waded through all his pomposity about historical and structural factors being so much more important than Eichenwald's naive emphasis on personality, waiting for his actual explanation, which finally appears on page 3:<p><i>As the Internet emerged, creating a sort of supercritical soup of technological mixing and matching (not to mention viruses from a newly anarchic Russian sphere  the world is a big place), the relatively open PC platform became increasingly unstable and confusing. It was too open, too vulnerable to the natural chaos that hides in openness. At the same time, as consumer markets and graphical capabilities became increasingly important, and vertical integration began to offer serious advantages.</i><p>Huh? That's a just-so story made of MBA word salad. You could just as easily concoct the opposite narrative, which ironically is his complaint about Eichenwald.<p>But it's Eichenwald who has the stronger prima facie case. We're supposed to believe that Gates-to-Ballmer didn't have a major effect? I don't buy that. And that Amelio-to-Jobs didn't have a massive effect?

(I would argue that it is why nearly everything we use today is Unix -- servers, iOS and MacOS, Android, etc.)<p>I somewhat agree when people say ""code reuse has failed"".  When people set out to write ""reusable code"", it ends up not being reusable.  Usually because they think of reuse as writing a bunch of classes that they can ""import"".<p>But writing tools is another way to reuse software.  For example, in Unix, you reuse ssh for git and for scp.  With the web, you can reuse a huge amount of work in Varnish and nginx by chaining components.<p>So library reuse is not all it's cracked up to be, but that's not what McIlroy is doing.

So McIlroy <i>was</i> a library/framework writer.<p>> Most code, even when written with intent to be reusable -- isn't.<p>I more or less agree with this; but fortunately, you don't have to look at ""most"" code to find code that <i>is</i> reusable. As witness, once again, the Unix utilities. Or, for that matter, the Python builtins and standard library that I used to build the Python versions of the ""word count"" program.<p>Moreover, even if you're in Knuth's position and don't have a good base of reusable code to draw on already, it still makes a big difference how you proceed from there.

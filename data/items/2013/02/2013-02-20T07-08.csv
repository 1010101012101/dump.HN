I'm not saying you shouldn't eat it, everyone's body is different, and if I were in a 2hr race I'd probably be eating gels etc to guarantee maximal energy availability at all times. I just don't think you need it to be able to get round without running into trouble.<p>Anecdotal reference point: I go out every weekend with 3 friends, we do minimum 3.5 hours riding time in the local mountains, and the most any of us eat is something like a cereal bar and a banana.

If your goal was 1 month to transfer 20 GB, you utilized overnight shipping, and required a day to load/unload data from drives at either end, that's 200 drives in flight, 50 of which are outbound, 50 returning, 50 writing, and 50 reading, on any given day.<p>You even get to take weekends off.<p>It's $48,000 in media.  Plus shipping (not inconsiderable).  You'd save on the cost of dedicated data transfer equipment (datacenter, router, links), though you'd need infrastructure for reading/writing data, and of course, storage at the remote side if you're not simply shipping disks for installation (which, frankly, is probably your best bet).<p>Resync should be fairly reasonably accomplished over the wire.<p>You can vary the math by taking longer (fewer drives, less cost) or shorter (more drives, higher cost), or even by utilizing ground shipping (7 days) at far lower cost.",1361345907

The wifi card in the kiosks isn't very reliable, so doing it in one call is very helpful (only one thing to retry a couple times, vs 10-ish objects, max depth of 4).<p>From what I can tell, django-rest-framework is read-only beyond one level of depth (you can return a nested hierarchy, but not post it in one shot)<p>Also, some of my objects are transient (e.g. credit card data), so I don't have a django model for each object that is an input to the api.

The engineers thought about the company as technology-based, and our work certainly was to develop such technology; we were the bread and butter of the staff, which means that most of the company's workforce was devoted to create software. As for managers and such, they only talked about advertising whenever revenue was directly involved in the discussion, but usually that wasn't the case despite it being our basic source of money, since we were already an established company without funding problems. Most of the time they took the revenue for granted, and the guidelines they gave us were not about ad visibility and such, but about user experience, increasing the time they spent on our site, etc. So, basically, there was a big separation between what we did and where we got the money from. I think that a company is far better defined from the former than the latter, and I'm inclined to think that people in google think the same, even the non-technical staff.",1361345853

If a school were to be funded by billboards on school buses, would you say it's an elementary school, or an advertising company?<p>If the source of revenue actually drives what the company uses that revenue for, I think you have a point, I think it is arguable that Google reinvests most of profits in ads. If you look at Android or Chrome, they are both large projects, that did not start out to generate ad revenue, but both to improve mobile and the web, and to build a defensive moat that would prevent a competitor from controlling the on-ramps.   Indeed, it seems Apple iOS generates far more ad revenue, so getting people to use Android actually reduces ad revenue. :)",1361345614

Nobody actually has any property rights - even trees don't grow without government planting efforts.  Farmers can't choose their own crops.<p>This is actually really different than what happens in the real world.  Really, if a community doesn't have a school, people get together and start one.

Did you pay for Netscape when they used to charge money?<p>I assure you, revenue doesn't increase magically quarter by quarter, in case you haven't noticed, when Google started out, most of the population still wasn't online yet, and most advertising dollars were spent in print and video media. Most of the meteoric rise can be traced simply to growth in the online audience and a switch-over from print to digital, not somehow arm twisting someone to click on an ad, if anything, people are induced to click on ads by making them less annoying and more relevant, otherwise, they 'mentally adblock' them.<p>You can believe what you want about motives, I only know what I experience everyday as far as others I know -- we like working on interesting or hard problems, just like any collection of geeky engineers and scientists.

Websockets make it doable. Framing is not as big of an issue. Most TCP based protocols (save for file streaming) already have some messaging at a higher level. In IRC you can think of the line as a message.<p>Almost every protocol I built on top of the TCP transport had to have framing and I had to mess with buffers, message headers, terminators, partially filled messages.<p>> I can only get the Websocket protocol.<p>One cool new feature is WebRTC it should support a datachannel connections and peer-to-peer (now you can make the web server a peer as well). So there it seems would be another case of streaming binary data to the server.<p>> I was thinking some cool hacks become possible if you could talk to an arbitrary TCP server from JS,<p>Yeah that would be cool. JS code would instead have to dealt with websockets or WebRTC data channels. It wouldn't open a TCP, socket, bind, listen, connect all those things. Now on the server side you can anything you want. For example I like the web STOMP adopter that RabbitMQ people have. You can effectively send and receive MQ (STOMP) messages from a browswer to an exchange. That is cool. There are VNC viewers built with websockets and canvas. So it is doable but I don't think its place is to put in nginx as a standard compiled in features. These all can be plugins.",1361344668

We already know <i>where</i> dark matter is just by observing changes in gravity, we just need to know <i>what</i> it is. Neil DeGrasse Tyson explains this the best : <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSeXyDEWgyc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSeXyDEWgyc</a><p>The tl;dr of that article is basically that Dark Matter is theorised to be made of WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) which are matter that are their own anti-matter. Mind boggling concept since when ordinary matter meets anti-matter, it's an Angels and Demons style explosion. But these particles are their <i>own</i> ""matter"" and anti-matter in one, if that's what they really are.<p>These WIMPs give rise to positrons, which are basically anti-electrons (anti-matter variant of electrons) and this is what these sensors are alleged to have detected. WIMPs are what they think create positrons and regular electrons.<p><pre><code>  ""The smoking gun signature is a rise and then a dramatic fall"" in the number of positrons with respect to energy,
  because the positrons produced by dark matter annihilation would have a very specific energy, 
  depending on the mass of the WIMPs making up dark matter...

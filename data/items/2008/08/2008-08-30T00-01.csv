But there is a common standard for how many shares you should have, so the # shares is normally comparable between different companies.  Sometimes you do get this crazy company with 100M shares post round A.  That's a bad sign in itself.",1220057678

When we moved to Boston to take part in YC I stopped entirely. My decline was accelerated by all-nighters, a poor diet and stress, but the root cause of gaining weight is... not exercising!<p>Changing jobs can, in some cases, cause a fluctuation in weight, but if you exercise regularly and take measures to have a good diet, then it really shouldn't matter. Just because there's an abundance of food doesn't mean you need to eat it! We're moving next week and since I am thoroughly disgusted with myself now, it's time to start hitting the gym promptly after that.<p>Final note: Push-ups aren't conducive to weight loss. And somebody tell all the people in that video to <i>stop looking down while they do them</i>! Ugh.",1220057516

It varies from not being able to see at night, to getting worse vision, to going completely blind.

At some point, when I was working out a lot,  i was obsesed with bench-pressing, and trained a lot of them.  The result was an onverdeveloped chest, and triceps, while the rest was just more regular looking.  It just made me look more bulky, but I don't think it made me anymore healthy.<p>I ignored my legs, and biceps, and at some point ended up injuring my knees, playing soccer,  mainly b/c I just didn't exercise my legs as the rest of my body.<p>Lesson learned.  You have to go to the gym, and do all the range of excercises, and not just one kind.",1220056414

When things are running smoothly and I have a decent amount of free time, I sleep well, eat healthily, and work out regularly.  When things are busy, and I have a huge to-do list, my stress level is way up, and there's tons of stuff demanding my time, I sleep less and poorly, I crave carb and fat rich foods when I'm stressed, and I have a much harder time taking breaks to workout, etc...<p>Right now I'm dealing with my first house purchase and a cross-country move on top of my normal work, and my health has taken a big dive.

6114947,comment,6113582,6114149,5,0,derefr,,,"A country starts a war, fundamentally, when they see a resource (land; oil; people) that they think they can claim without destroying its value in the process. However, all the technologies we&#x27;ve developed since WWII that make us more efficient at mass-killing (chemical/biological weapons et al) are politically-blind; Anthrax will infect the conqueror as much as the conquered. The only real advance we&#x27;ve made in the &quot;things that will kill the enemy but leave you alone to sit in their houses and farm their land&quot; field, in the last 70 years, are drones--and, tactically-speaking, they haven&#x27;t increased the <i>difficulty</i> of war much for the side of the invaded, just made waging a war <i>safer</i> for the invader. So, it&#x27;s not any <i>easier</i> to win a war against a nation at technological parity with your own than it was 70 years ago.<p>On the other hand, over the last 50 years, besides there having been built within every world-leader a strong awareness of the &quot;final solution&quot; (nukes) available to the major powers to put down any sufficient threat, a true global trade economy has also emerged, with strong economic interdependence between the major powers (China holding US debt &c). Every power is now just as much beholden, economically, to each other power, as if they were an export colony; the US going to war with China, for example, would be cutting off one&#x27;s nose to spite one&#x27;s face in the same way that Britain choosing, without provocation, to start warring with America in 1775 would have been. In this situation, I don&#x27;t see much chance of a major power instigating an empire-building war.<p>Also, unlike in WWI, a country that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a major power doesn&#x27;t have the political weight to instigate a major war--nobody will follow it into battle. Attacking a country in a union with a major power is implicitly attacking that power, and military strategists now treat it that way, instead of thinking they can &quot;just&quot; take the country. Instead, we merely see individual unallied states getting nasty to their unallied neighbors--free radicals bumping into one-another--and having to be calmed down by some third party. I would guess future &quot;wars&quot; all across the globe will look more like the US&#x27;s dealings in Afghanistan/Iraq than it will like some sort of confrontation between NATO and some new Axis.<p>Another way to put it, is that national political borders across much of the globe have basically annealed down to a rest-state. The resignation to this fact is what seems to have spurred the EU into existence; if you can&#x27;t invade your neighbor any more, you may as well cooperate and trade. I see this sort of idea spreading (though perhaps without the shared monetary policy aspect, which doesn&#x27;t seem to be working out too well) as more regions of the world &quot;settle&quot;, leaving basically four or five pretty-similar political bodies in a de-facto world-government union, and individual break-away states here or there which are filled up with &quot;peacekeeping forces&quot; by the one or another of the powers.<p>I think this logic is pretty common to people who don&#x27;t have a dystopian view of the future. Do you see some major flaw in it?",1374969557

A newly started Cassandra node will absent a token declaration in its yaml file, auto-assign a token. This is never what you want in a cluster distribution. So the workaround is either to patch the deb to not autostart or let it start, stop it, and blow away the data directories. This allows cluster management tools (such as Priam) to control the token allocation first,  and then re-start Cassandra.<p>This is effectively how Debian/Ubuntu work.

6114923,comment,6114381,6114381,6,0,kephra,,,"I&#x27;ve collected Spitzkeglige Kahlkpfe (Psilocybe semilanceata) for several years, and send more then 100 people on a trip. So some advise from an old hippy, in random order:<p>Its easy to confuse Psilocybe semilanceata with Dngerling (Panaeolus papilionaceus), that is growing on same meadows, but at different times. Its less dangerous to collect magic mushrooms, then to collect mushrooms for food, because most mushrooms mimic a poisonous one. If you collect magic mushrooms and pick the wrong one, then you don&#x27;t have a trip, but if you collect mushrooms for food, and pick the wrong one you become ill, and might even die. But still, always collect them with someone who knows them well, because else you might pick non magic light poison mushrooms first, think you need high dose to feel something, and next time you take a much to high dose, if you got the right ones.<p>Do not eat them when tired in the evening, but better at the morning before eating anything else. Do not drink or take other drugs same time. I prefer to put them into a yogurt or quark. Drink a tea afterwards, wait 10 minutes after eating them, and then eat as much as you can, because you need the power, and likely are not able to eat anything while on trip.<p>Always take them in a small group of friends you really trust, and one of the group should stay sober, just for the case one goes crazy. Agree beforehand that you care for each other, and that you do not send anybody into a hospital, because insane asylums makes everything worse. They will put people on hard drugs, so those people become asylum addicted. Be prepared that someone might need help after a trip. Those who went crazy will become sane within a week, if you care for them at a good place, e.g. a cottage in the rural, but they might become asylum addicted for decades, if they can get no other help then those who exploit them for health insurance money.<p>Be prepared to go outside. Walking miles is very common on a mushroom trip. The one who is sober must ensure that the group stays together and nobody gets lost. Being alone on a trip is a very bad setting. Do not walk through the city, but through nature, and avoid places where big crowds of people are, e.g. dance clubs or festivals. The sober guy is also the mule for water, and should ensure that everybody is drinking enough.<p>Mushrooms do not cause addiction, but they are an anti-drug. Everybody I know who collected mushrooms in my age stopped it at some time, including me. But never try to blow up your trip forever. Never add more mushrooms to am existing trip, neither because of impatience nor because you want to continue the &quot;fun&quot;. The only cases I know of people who got locked in (drug induced psychosis) on a trip are those who eat several times within a few days, and those who went to an insane asylum, where the trip is treated with other even more dangerous drugs.<p>The main trip will be 4-6 hours, followed by an activity phase of an other 6-8 hours, followed by a vibrant phase of several days, where memories of the trip come up very vivid, and feelings are very different. The complete trip takes a week most often. So never take them more then once a month. And never more then 3 times a year. Mushrooms are not a party drug, they are a sharp tool to reshape your mind. Be prepared that memories of your trip will burn deep into your mind. A trip is a lesson you will never forget. So do not take them, if you have bad feelings, in a bad group, in a bad set or setting.<p>Magic mushrooms are called magic for a good reason. You might encounter things that can not be explained by science. Those magic comes often together with a horror trip. e.g. my worst horror trip was when I was walking through a part of the city where lots of drug and drunk people party, and a few of them had green faces. Each of them stuck me with a horror. And the horror became even worse over the next half year, as each of them died on an overdose of heroin.",1374969049

Some would argue that they&#x27;re more valuable than good trips, where you may not learn much at all.  Bad trips can involve facing unpleasant but important aspects of yourself, your life, that of your friends or family, or the world around you.  Try to learn from them and use the insight you get from them to grow and improve your life.<p>That said, I personally think that strong psychedelics are best used under the guidance of a good therapist, who can help you deal with the very powerful and sometimes unpleasant experiences that many people have trouble assimilating on their own.<p>Unfortunately, psychedelics are currently taboo and illegal in much of the world, and most therapists either don&#x27;t want anything to do with them or are ignorant of their incredible therapeutic potential.  However, there are still some theraphists out there who are knowedgeable and willing to work with these substances and with the right clients.  It may take some work to find them, but could be very worthwhile to do so, if you are serious about self-discovery and constructive use of these substances.",1374968627

If you look on the web (or particularly on YouTube) for outsider mathematics/physics you can find a lot of slightly unbalanced people are convinced they&#x27;ve managed to square the circle or invent perpetual motion machines. Drugs make such epiphanies far more intense and increase the risk of false positives.

Hope you can see this.)<p>No matter what you think of Apple, or Google, and their respective ecosystems, I&#x27;m curious what people think of Samsungs popularity. They&#x27;re a massive South Korean company that until recently was well known mostly for ripping off other companies products and out-marketing them (I&#x27;m not making this up, these accusations go back decades now covering a variety of consumer products, go ahead and Google it). Some people, myself included, don&#x27;t really believe this practice ever ended. Say something were to happen to Apple and Samsung truly pulled away as the technology leader in the future. Are you as a consumer happy putting your eggs in that basket, so to speak? Do you think Samsung is going to embrace a culture of innovation, vision and design? I honestly don&#x27;t see it. As a designer, I&#x27;ve stayed clear of Samsung products because they just come off as cheap (or expensive) imitations. As a market leader, you have the privilege to introduce consumers to exciting new technologies, UI innovations and ideas. Samsung isn&#x27;t built for that. Their idea of great design is hiring 1,000 good designers and taking a little bit from each one. That&#x27;s not how design works. You have to have a unified vision with a great idea behind it. Consistency is so important. I don&#x27;t care if Apple is the leader for the next decade but I&#x27;d rather a more creative company took the reins.",1374967775

The burden of proof would be on you to justify that the altered state of consciousness is indeed more in line with reality.<p>Of course, this comes with the premise that consciousness is a necessity. And indeed, our needs nowadays might require a different state of consciousness, now that the very basic survival needs are generally fulfilled.",1374966409

Prometheus Rising?) is that when he talks about doing LSD for the first time with Leary and co, all these guys were in their 30s!! I can&#x27;t imagine how shocking it would be to have gotten that far in your life, believing and committing to the perceptions you&#x27;ve had, only to have them ripped apart by those megadoses (by today&#x27;s standards) of LSD.<p>I think that is also why they made such good use of the experiences. Having more life experience, they might have been even more appreciative of the new insight.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Prometheus-Rising-Robert-Anton-Wilson/dp/1561840564"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Prometheus-Rising-Robert-Anton-Wilson/...</a>",1374966353

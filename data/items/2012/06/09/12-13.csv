4087988,comment,4085459,4085459,1,0,yashchandra,,,"One advice I would like to give as a 31 year old to 20 year old kids is: Save up. This may not seem like having any connection with career or startups etc at first. But only if I had saved up last 10 years, I would have a lot better safety net to quit my job and start something of my own. Not that I would not do it now but it would have been nicer to have a better padding. \nIt is simple. If you have entrepreneurial itch as a 20 year old, you cannot have the lifestyle of a regular 20 year old who spends most of what they make (not generalizing necessarily but you get my point). \nI bought a BMW convertible 4 years ago since I could afford it. I did not think about saving that extra money instead and keep my old car which was btw a 2006 Honda. So you see the point. Today, I only drive my wife's car since I can commute to work using public transportation. Just my 2 cents.",1339246712

4087941,comment,4080268,4087686,1,0,photon137,,,"But you did earn that increase in value. A home you couldn't afford in 2006 because it cost $300,000 is now affordable at $175,000. The purchasing power of your dollars did go up (actually it didn't ""go up"" - it is reaching it's fair value - earlier your purchasing power was less). What the Fed did wrong was it didn't stop your purchasing power from decreasing back in the 2002-2006 era because it thought home-based credit supply would support the decrease in your income-based purchasing power (they never knew how interconnected banks with high leverage would soon destroy that fantasy - although they should have known.)<p>What the Fed tried to do after the crisis was to avoid deflation (which is as bad and as self-fulfilling a prophecy as inflation). Say I am a highly creditworthy homebuyer. If I had $175,000 (continuing with the example above) in my bank account, I would buy that house right out of the market. But most people don't make a downpayment of 100% (liquidity is precious to everyone).<p>I would take out a 30-yr mortgage at, say, 5%. Say, home prices are falling every year by 2%. So, if I make a purchase now - I end up paying 7%  - 5% interest and a 2% loss in my home's value - that's the concept of a a real interest rate = (nominal rate  - inflation), deflation being negative inflation). Now I am not protected by this capital destruction from my bank (they aren't paying me 7% on my equivalent-term deposits - they would be paying me something like 5% - similar to what I am paying for the mortgage).<p>So I would delay my home-purchase. That causes a further fall in home prices and so on - a deflation death spiral (something which happened in the 30's). As a corollary, in an inflationary scenario, people bring their purchasing decision forward (""it's cheap now, it'll be expensive later"") which causes a rise in asset prices - which is again bad if not controlled (we know what happened, right?).<p>What would break this loop, though? Well, if the mortgage rate went down to 3%. That's exactly what the Fed did in QE1 (and in part, in QE2 and Operation Twist) - it stepped in to buy long-tenor MBSes directly, inflating their price and lowering their yield - causing mortgage rates to fall. Now you'd say, wouldn't depo-rates fall as well to 3%. Yes, they would - but they are more ""sticky"" than mortgage rates. That delay in money-market/depo-rate cut allows asset prices to recover - opening up non-money market avanues for investment - bonds/stocks etc. Also, the economy's ""natural"" growth-rate gets a chance to show its effect (which in the US's case was led by the tech and manufacturing sector).<p>There's another reason mortgage rates couldn't go down - the whole US MBS system is screwed up with stupid servicing, refinancing and foreclosure mechanisms - making it difficult to assess true recovery in case of default. While the government and the legislature kept on debating about HARP/HAMP/TARP/ARRA what-not, this deflationary spiral had to be stopped - the Fed did so. To get an idea of how a non-Freddie/Fannie system can work, look at the world's second largest MBS market - Denmark - not a single MBS default in 200 years! - <a href=""http://www.coveredbondinvestor.com/sites/default/files/Danish%20Mortgage%20Model.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coveredbondinvestor.com/sites/default/files/Danis...</a>",1339245106

4087906,comment,4085780,4086364,1,0,czzarr,,,"Backbone is very minimalist, which is great because it gets out of your way and you rarely end up bundling huge unused chunks of code with your app. However it also means that you're going to have to write a decent amount of boilerplates and make design choices as to how you want the different parts of your application to work together. This can be non trivial and I would advise any newcomer to do it by hand after reading a book like [Javascript Patterns](<a href=""http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596806767.do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596806767.do</a>) but for people who already know where they are going and understand all the implications of such patterns, a framework like Aura can probably speed up development tremendously.\nWith that said I'm going to dive in the Aura source code asap to see what it really looks like.\nIf you know NodeJS, I think it's fair to compare Aura to Restify and Backbone to the http module.",1339243915

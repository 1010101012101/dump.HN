To me (I'm sure people  will disagree, np) it's easier to write down a task when you start it, or when you are in the middle of it, than when you end it.

When a company forces you to work more than the hours indicated in your job description when you signed on without additional compensation this is called <i>stealing</i>.<p>From now on, in place of ""long hours"" or ""overtime"" we should simply state... ""Yeah my company had a big project due so they stole about 20 hours each from us last month"", or ""Our employer steals from us all the time, they call it 'being a team player' or something..."". In fact, mention theft at every opportunity when discussing required extra hours. It works for the RIAA and music, it should work for the cube dweller too.",1218108036

I don't actually know) I think they do that just so they can have a positive showing on these checklist comparisons, but it ends up hurting the consumer, who has to make uninformed choices and ends up being dependent on slimy salespeople. In addition, developers also have to deal with multiple versions, which must be a support nightmare.<p>It's a classic example of marketing directives (market segmentation and looking good in these price/feature comparisons) hurting the overall product.",1218107887

Given that I'm a sole founder and tarsnap is pre-revenue, I can only guess that YouNoodle is giving me very high marks for (a) having a doctorate from Oxford, and (b) having started university when I was 13 years old.<p>Of course, I'd be happy if YouNoodle was correct in their assessment... but if someone offered to buy tarsnap for $3.71M right now -- or offered to buy any fraction of tarsnap for a corresponding fraction of that amount -- I'd have no hesitation in accepting the offer.<p>EDIT: Yes, I do realize that the assessed value is effective a year from now -- but I still think $3.71M would be a generous amount to pay for tarsnap.  Of course, tarsnap might take off faster than I expect...",1218106871

Ultimately the Minitel was a dumb terminal, but like so many of the technologies at the time, what this meant was usually just a matter of flicking a few bits.<p>Remember also that the 8-bit revolution was going on in the computer world at the time.  A lot of savvy French got 8-bit machines they could program, or load up &quot;MINITEL.ROM&quot;, if they wanted.  One of the reasons that the Oric-1 hardware even managed to live an extra few years before completing the 8-bit apocalypse, was because the French market for nice computers that could also access MiniTel was thriving.",1382424982

I don&#x27;t need to anticipate a bike hitting me from behind on the sidewalk because they are illegal there, and in the street, I look around (horizontally!) like every other pedestrian.  I think that you also fail to understand how things like space, privacy, quietness, accountability, and yes, aesthetics are shared resources in a city that have to be carefully balanced among ALL people, not just an emotional or sarcastic 1%.  To manage those concerns take resources, like police, city council members, and licensing.<p>Perhaps you would volunteer to test and license every operator and RC aircraft in the NYC for noise, safety, and flight-worthiness?  And to respond to all of the reckless endangerment complaints that will happen anyway?  No?  Then I guess it will eventually cost me money.  And no, I don&#x27;t think every future reckless operator of an RC aircraft will be dumb enough to record his face on takeoff.  It would seem that being able to control them from thousands of feet away, operator unseen, makes it a <i>little</i> harder to police than, say, a hit and run motorist, and the police already have plenty of problems catching them.  But perhaps you are ready to volunteer your time and money to solve that problem as well.<p>Many people choose to live in the suburbs and rural areas (many more than in places with the density of Manhattan, for sure).  There are already many different opportunities for kids there that don&#x27;t exist in the city (why, my kid would like to ride his pony and his ATV on the streets, and go skeet shooting!  why can&#x27;t he?)  I shed no tears for the sad future children of Manhattan who will be utterly deprived of the opportunity to fly their RC drones down avenues with hundreds of pedestrians.  There are literally <i>millions</i> of square miles in the rest of this country where you can do that at a fraction of the risk.  And if their parent really cares, they can drive ten miles into Jersey or upstate and do it in a large open park, the way any responsible person already does today.",1382424959

You could lock in a loss for no other reason than the market becoming very volatile due to some news item or some other reason like the flash crash. And you can&#x27;t even guarantee to limit your losses at the stop loss price. It&#x27;s just the price that triggers an attempt to unwind the position.<p>Also, the market may not go against you immediately. What if the glitch in the system means you&#x27;re opening positions in stocks and you drive up the price by doing so? The losses are not immediately apparent. There&#x27;s no screen where you could watch your losses run up in real time. The losses only become apparent once you try to unwind those positions and that&#x27;s the case in many kinds of scenarios.<p>I believe it took J.P Morgan months to unwind the London Whale positions and really know what losses were incurred.<p>I think there&#x27;s a better chance of catching a glitch at the point where the positions are opened.",1382422374

Currently I might grep for usages of a term, and project out the (module name, term) pairs. I then run this query a few times for different terms, and use Excel to merge and pivot the data so the first column is a module name and the remaining columns mark occurrences of each term. I then copy paste into Vim and use a regex to mangle the data into wiki markup.<p>There is surely a better way of doing this, using a single tool to glue the steps together so that the pipeline is repeatable and the various steps are individually reusable.",1382422327

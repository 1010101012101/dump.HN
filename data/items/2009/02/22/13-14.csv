I never really considered the cost of maintaining a DNS server to be all that significant.",1235310242

Just make the money go to new green tech ventures.<p>I'd also venture a guess that after Manhattan, So Cal has lost more money per capita in the real estate bubble than many other places in the country.  So Cal is where that investment and research is needed.  There's already a lot of Solar and Wind power projects down there.  It would be a great idea to invest green tech VC money down there.  So Cal _is_ ""Main Street"" for millions of people that are hurting right now.",1235310068

In my effort to keep my expenses low I sat down and calculated how much it would have been to move them into the cloud. Since it would actually result in reduced expense (both in terms of money and time) compared to my current setup I am going for it.<p>I will have to ""outsource"" my current dns setup and I am looking for some reliable [paid or free] service, possibily with a decent web based interface. It would be a plus to be able to deal with domain zone files directly (or with a certain degree of freedom), since I master them pretty well.<p>As of now I found this one: http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/pages/dns.html -- it looks quite good and the prices are not bad at all, but I am wondering if there are any valid alternatives.<p>Thanks",1235309909

Those projects are capital intensive, and have the potential for VC profitable exits.<p>Software projects don't really need money on a VC scale any more.  They need angel level investment.<p>Silicon Valley is going to start needing a lot more EE's with a specialization in Green tech, and few and fewer software engineers.",1235309577

That was more interesting to me than any of the other depthless articles about ""iphone app makes $x"" featuring his game.<p>Yes the game did save his families home, he had a job, he had more bills than he could pay due to unexpected medical fees and I assume he couldn't afford everything at once, if he hadn't had done something the house would have probably had to be put up for sale.<p>So he did something about it. Isn't that what its all about?",1235308770

I too had fun signing up.\nBut if there is something more to it, I can't say I've spotted it. Why does the user benefit from this service?\nIt was kind of vague for my taste at least. On the other hand maybe I missed something.. :)<p>Just a technical note, I couldn't get it to work with Opera 9.51, after entering my name I was redirected to the first question and then instantly on the end page. You might want to fix that.<p>Kudos for the idea though..",1235307952

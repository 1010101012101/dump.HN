Bahakan ada yang menggunakan bahan kimia sekalaipun, padahal jika kita terlalu banyak mengkonsumsi obat yang mengandung bahan kimia lama kelamaan akan menimbulkan efeksamping yang sangat fatal, Tips Sehat Untuk Penderita Ambeien kami sediakan bagi anda yang ingin mengobati ambeien dengan alami.
Sekilas pengertian Tentang Ambeien:<p>Ambeien / Hemorrhoid adalah pelebaran vena di dalam pleksus hemorroidalis yang tidak merupakan keadaan patologik. Hemorrhoid merupakan pembengkakan submukosa pada lubang anus yang mengandung pleksus vena, arteri kecil, dan jaringan areola yang melebar.<p>Hemorrhoid, ambein, atau wasir dapat dialami oleh siapapun. Namun seringkali penderita merasa malu atau dianggap tidak penting maka kurang memperhatikan gangguan kesehatan ini. Secara anatomi ambeien bukanlah penyakit, melainkan perubahan fisiologis yang terjadi pada bantalan pembuluh darah di dubur, berupa pelebaran dan pembengkakan pembuluh darah dan jaringan sekitarnya.<p>Fungsi bantalan ini sebagai klep/katup yang membantu otot-otot dubur menahan feses. Bila terjadi gangguan (bendungan) aliran darah, maka pembuluh darah akan melebar dan membengkak, keadaan ini disebut ambeien.<p>Secara umum, ambeien dibagi dua yaitu Ambeien Internal dan Ambeien eksternal :
1. Ambeien Internal,
pembengkakan terjadi dalam rektum sehingga tidak bisa dilihat atau diraba. Pembengkakan jenis ini tidak menimbulkan rasa sakit karena hanya ada sedikit syaraf di daerah rektum. Tanda yang dapat diketahui adalah pendarahan saat buang air besar. Masalahnya jadi tidak sederhana lagi, bila ambeien internal ini membesar dan keluar ke bibir anus yang menyebabkan kesakitan. Ambeien yang terlihat berwarna pink ini setelah sembuh dapat masuk sendiri, tetapi bisa juga didorong masuk.<p>2. Ambeien Eksternal,
menyerang anus sehingga menimbulkan rasa sakit, perih, dan gatal. Jika terdorong keluar oleh feses, ambeien ini dapat mengakibatkan penggumpalan (trombosis), yang menjadikan ambeien berwarna biru-ungu.

E.g. web fonts (in purple, swooping in from the bottom) shows up around 2000 but doesn't hit a browser version till 2008.<p>CSS2D transforms (purple, from the top) starts in 2009, swooping backwards in time to hit Safari 3.1 in 2008.<p>If these two swoops correspond to the real story that web fonts were designed much earlier than they were adopted, and CSS2D transforms were implemented before they were formally designed (perhaps by W3C), then that would be very cool. But I fear it's just as likely that the introduction points are arbitrary.<p>If anyone knows the stories of the design and adoption of CSS2D transforms or webfonts, I'd be grateful for a little enlightenment.",1341067963
4181747,comment,4181382,4181682,3,0,drucken,,,"I would suggest actual misconceptions are that:<p>1. <i>Fungability</i>: companies have similar tax flexibility as individuals and are therefore comparable.<p>2. <i>Consumption equivalence</i>: that income from capital gains or ""personal tax breaks for these business gains"" is actually redistributed back into the general economy in the same way as it would be as general (wage) income.<p>Both are clearly incorrect.<p>I would go a step further to suggest the US has a relatively high corporation tax compared to other developed countries precisely to compensate for other tax code deficiencies and trends.<p>Of course, in a sense, all the current arrangements do is capture the ""middle"" or ""poor"" class of corporates.

4181746,comment,4181436,4181542,1,0,mistercow,,,">Excuse me, but Windows had a Taskbar before Apple had a Dock.<p>Of course they did. But the Dock was used quite differently than the taskbar (it is primarily used to hold shortcuts, not to show you what is open), so it made sense to rename it in that case. But Microsoft seems to rename things just so they can feel unique. Don't get me wrong; I don't think it's some horrendous crime, or that it's unethical or anything. I just think it's funny. Apple has, of course, been known to do the same thing. For example, it was rather silly how before Lion, they insisted on referring to all perfectly ordinary 802.11 WiFi technologies as ""AirPort"", and how they wrapped OpenAL in the most cursory of framework boilerplate and called it ""Core Audio"".<p>>Windows also had Quick Launch shortcuts before Apple had a Dock as well.<p>And Apple had the Launcher three years earlier than that.

To see why, consider that your nanny doesn't get taxed at a lower rate just because you pay her with income that was taxed when you received it. The corporation is a distinct legal entity and it is taxed as such.<p>This taxation scheme isn't gratuitous. The corporate vehicle offers investors the tremendous advantage of limited liability. When it comes to a creditor's suit against the company, the corporation is treated as a distinct entity and the investor is not liable in such suits beyond his investment. The cost of being treated like a separate entity in lawsuits is being treated like a separate entity when it comes to taxation.<p>Limited liability is not free. When creditors cannot collect because an investor's corporation has insufficient assets, they bear the losses of activity that is attributable to and generates profits for the investor. If investors did not want to be taxed this way, they could reorganize their investments as partnerships. That way they would be taxed as individuals and bear liability for their business activities like individuals.",1341067682

I don't think many graduate students would consider doing this right after graduation...I certainly wasn't in a mood to write another detailed document after getting done with my dissertation (also a couple of months ago, and in computer science).<p>I wanted to add a little about the end-game. For me, the decision of what to do next followed a slightly different path. In the fall of my 5th year, while planning to graduate, I had to really think about what to do next. Academia sounded interesting, so I went ahead and applied to tenure track jobs, and did interviews. Come winter, I had an offer from an Ivy League school. But I had also wanted to do startups for a while.<p>From my experience, working on projects that were not provided/sanctioned by advisors was somewhat like working on a startup. You have to build things that others find useful/interesting, sell the crap out of it in publications, presentations etc, and I also had to fund it.(my research was building systems software that improves user experience in poor network environments, like those common in developing regions. One of the definite perks was travelling lots and deploying stuff I built.)<p>In other words, I have no idea why <i>most</i> PhDs are not be expected to go work on a startup when they finish. They are domain experts, and are expected to be good communicators when it is all said and done.<p>So, when it came time to make the call---an assistant professor, or a startup founder---I chose the later (and disappointed my advisor). Some friends tell me I could have done that without a PhD, and it was a waste of time. I think a PhD naturally leads to a start up. The Grind, as the op calls it, is something that teaches you a lot about yourself, and surrounds you with some of the smartest people you'll find. Your job, every single day, is to innovate [with a more flexible runway]...and you can make (and learn) a lot out of it.",1341066865

4181663,comment,4181348,4181348,47,0,rkalla,,,"<i>Mindless rambling ahead; I love this topic</i><p>Richard,<p>AWS is an amazing tool and you have a few options here, but the downside is the more options you use to be highly-available (HA), the more expensive AWS gets (as you would imagine).<p>Your first option is to be HA across a SINGLE region; to do this you make use of the elastic load balancers (ELB) + auto-scaling. You setup auto-scale rules to launch more instances in different availability zones (AZ) either in response to demand or in response to failures (e.g. ""always keep at least 3 instances running"").<p>You compliment that with an ELB to load-balance incoming requests automatically across those instances in the different AZs. This is all fairly straight forward through the web console (except auto-scaling is still done via CLI for some reason)<p>If you want to be HA ACROSS regions you can't just use ELBs anymore, you have some added complexity and an additional AWS feature you will likely want to use: Route 53.<p>Route 53 is Amazon's DNS service which offers a lot of slick DNS-features like removing dead points from DNS rotation, latency-based routings, etc. There are also something like 29 deployments of Route53 (and CloudFront) around the globe so you'll hopefully never have Route53 become a point of failure for you even disaster strikes.<p>In this scenario you would setup the HA configuration for a single-region as mentioned above, but you would do it in multiple regions. Put another way, 2+ servers in multiple AZs in <i>each</i> AWS region. Then a Route53 DNS configuration setup to point to each ELB in each region representing those individual pockets of servers.<p>Ontop of that you would use Route53 to manage all routing of client requests into your entire domain; you can leverage the new ""latency-based routing"" (effectively why everyone was asking for GeoDNS for years, but even better) and monitor capability to ensure you aren't routing anyone to a dead region.<p>SIMPLIFICATION<p>--------------<p>Here is what I would recommend given the size of your budget and need to stay up in the AWS cloud, in-order of expense:<p>1. Launch a single instance in a region with acceptable latency that has never had an outage before (e.g. Oregon has never completely gone down but Virginia has -- yes yes I know VA is older, but you understand my point). This solution will be cheaper than multiple instances in <i>any</i> region.<p>2. Launch multiple instances using the web console, in multiple AZs in US-EAST (cheapest option for multi-instances) and front them with an ELB. You skip any auto-scaling complexity here but you need to keep an eye on your servers. I think ELB fixed the issue where it would effectively route traffic into the void if all the instances in an AZ went down.<p>OPTIONAL: If you didn't mind spending a few $ more, you could do this strategy in the region that has never gone down for added piece of mind.<p>3. Launch single instances in multiple REGIONS and front them with Route53. This isn't really a recommended setup as entire regions will disappear if you lose a single instance, BUT I said I would list possibilities in order of price, so there you go. You could mitigate this by setting up auto-scaling policies to replace any dead instances quickly in the off chance you wanted to do exactly this but not babysit the web console all day.<p>4. Launch multiple instances in each region, across multiple AZs fronted by ELBs and then the entire collection fronted by Route53.<p>NOTE: The real cost comes from the additional instances and not from Route53 or the ELB; so if you can use smaller instances to help keep costs down (or reserved instances also) that might allow you to provide a larger HA setup.<p>What about my data?<p>-------------------------<p>Yes, yes... this is an issue that someone already touched on (data locality below).<p>You will have to decide on a single region to hold your data; in this case I would recommend using DB services that aren't based on EC2 and have never experienced outages (or rarely) -- this includes S3, SimpleDB and/or DynamoDB. AWS's MySQL offering (RDS) are just custom EC2 instances with MySQL running on them, so any time EC2 goes down, RDS goes down.<p>The other DB offerings are all custom and except for SimpleDB a long time ago, have never experienced outages that I am aware of.<p>Making this choice is all about latency and which DB store you are comfortable with (obviously don't choose SimpleDB if everything you do requires MySQL -- then use RDS); you'll want your data as close to your web tier as possible, so if you are spread across all regions you'll just want to pick a region with the smallest latency to MOST of your customers (typically West coast if you have a lot of Asia/Aus customers and East coast if you have a lot of European customers).<p>Want to Go to 11?<p>-----------------<p>If you have the money and desperately want to go to 11 with this regional-scale (which I love to do, so I am sharing this) you can combine services like DynamoDB and SQS to effectively create a globally distributed NoSQL datastore with behavior along the lines of:<p>1. Write operation comes into a region, immediately write it to the local DynamoDB instance, asynchronously queue the write command in SQS and return to the caller.<p>2. In 1+ additional EC2 instances running daemons, pull messages from SQS in chunk sizes that make sense and re-play them out to the other regions DynamoDB stores; erase the messages when processed or if the processing fails the next dameon to spin up will replay it.<p>3. On reads, just hit the local DynamoDB in any region and reply; we trust our reconciliation threads to do the work to keep us all in sync <i>eventually</i>.<p>NOTE: If you prefer to do read-repairs here you can, but it will increase complexity and inter-region communication which all costs money.<p>The challenges with this approach is that you pull up a lot of DB concerns into your code like conflict resolution, resync'ing entire regions after failure, bringing new regions online and ensuring they are synchronized, diffs, etc.<p>There is a reason AWS doesn't offer a globally-distributed data store: it is a really hard problem to get right once you make it past the 80% use case.<p>Your data will determine if this is an option or not; some data allows for certain amounts of inconsistency in which case this strategy is awesome and works great; while other data (e.g. banking data) cannot allow a single wiggle of inconsistency in which case pulling all this DB logic up into the application is a bad idea. Your failure scenarios become catastrophic (e.g. your conflict-resolution logic is wrong and wipes out the balance from an account; or keeps re-filling the balance on an empty account... something bad basically)<p>It is all a trade-off though; if you managed your own Cassandra cluster though, Cassandra does all this and much more for you automatically; but then you just put your time into Cassandra administration instead of developing the logic around DynamoDB (or SimpleDB, or MySQL, or whatever); just pick which devil you feel more comfortable with.<p>I am not aware of a services company yet that offers cross-region AWS datastore deployments yet; Datastax and Iris Couch will setup things for that like you via a consulting/custom arrangement, but there isn't a dashboard for launching something like that automatically.<p>Hope that helped (and didn't bring you to tears of boredom)",1341065867

From what I can tell you just click a button to turn it on, but there were a lot of people complaining yesterday that the fail-over didn't work at all when it was supposed to.<p>I also have a bunch of EC2 VMs that do back-end processing and have a load of CRON jobs on them that need to run once every 24 hours.  If these go down for a couple of hours then there is no noticeable impact to my customers, they can still log into my service and access their historical data.<p>I have considered spreading across multiple regions etc but at the end of the day it's just too expensive for the small increase in reliability.",1341065624

When it comes to the time Craigslist fails its users functionally and aesthetically, it's hard to imagine no other players will surge up in the game;<p>3.

I use Electrum because it does not require the maintenance of a local blockchain, start up is immediate after long darkouts. It can be fully run off-line with no network connectivity. It supports aliases like email addresses instead if complicated bitcoin addresses. It uses deterministic key generation so I can literally backup my wallet in my head with a passphrase, erase my wallet, and recreate it from my mind. Oh yea, and it allows me to make transactions without any fees. Other worthwhile clients: Armory, Multibit. They are all viable and under rapid development.<p>Edit: electrum can be fully run offline as in you can monitor your balance without a network connection AND you can write transactions that can then be injected into the blockchain by a networked connection. But the electrum client at no time needs to be connected to the network.<p>Additionally, a networked computer can contain a deseeded wallet (no keys) for securely monitoring your off-line balances.",1341064916

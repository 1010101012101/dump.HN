No feature that one person demands, only things that can score you points with (almost) every customer in that bracket.  Plan out that work.  That will tell you how long you have before you can afford to move on an opportunity.<p>If you have good cash flow, consider hiring a person or two to chase some opportunities while your team remains focused.

Here are some relevant bits from that page:<p><i></i>Collaboration<i></i><p><i>Assembly apps are built by everyone, and like successful open source products, each app also has a Core Team of contributors. The Core Team influences the vision of the app and the standards for quality, and determines which contributions are accepted. It consists of the most active and respected contributors on the app. The Core Team may comprise the original creator, Assembly staff members, and members of the community who help make the product a reality (that’s you!).</i><p><i>Some people work on Assembly projects for just few hours a month. Some put in 40 hours a week. It’s up to you to work on what you want, when you want, where you want. The best part is that if you step away, the project keeps moving forward.</i><p><i></i>Ownership<i></i><p><i>The ownership of an Assembly product is distributed through App Coins. App Coins can be earned primarily by contributing to a product (design, code, copy, etc.). You can also receive “tips” in the form of App Coins when you provide insight, advice – or simply make someone laugh.</i><p><i>When an app launches and starts earning money, the profits are split each month among everyone who helped build it – based on the percentage of ownership each person has.</i><p><i>While the emphasis is on collaborating to create apps with sustainable earnings over the long term, people also occasionally ask about acquisitions. The answer is, if a company offers to acquire an Assembly product and the product’s core team decides to accept the offer, that income would be distributed (after expenses are paid) based on App Coin ownership, just like any other revenue.</i>",1403746643

Instead, an SSD has to read the current data from the page, modify that data with the new data that it wants to be there, and write the new data to the whole page at once. This is called a read-modify-write operation and is a major reason why SSDs (even now) decrease in performance as they fill up.<p>The issue is that when you delete a file on disk there is no way for the SSD to know that those data blocks aren&#x27;t important anymore (without TRIM). The controller of the SSD has to manage a full drive of data (even if you&#x27;re only actually using some percent of it) and only figures out that a file was deleted when it is finally told to write something else to that location.<p>TRIM tells the SSD that a file was removed and allows a controller to recover that area to help maintain its performance.<p>There is a really good discussion of this topic in this article from way back in 2009: <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/2829"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/2829</a>",1403744937

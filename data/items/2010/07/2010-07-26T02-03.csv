1546978,comment,1545774,1545774,0,0,starkfist,,,"This exact thing started happening to me more and more frequently when I hit age 30. I tried all the standard remedies: psychological tricks, pomodoro techniques, vacations, exercise, reducing stimulants, increasing stimulants, blocking the internet, and so forth. However, in late 2008 I faced up to the fact that I simply do not care as much about programming as I once did. I also did some soul searching and realized that perhaps I never really ""liked"" programming. My relationship to programming has been more like an obsession or compulsion than someone pursuing a passion.<p>My solution is that I set a hard deadline of my 35th birthday to leave the field. I took a much higher paying programming job in the financial sector at the beginning of 2009, and moved in with roommates for the first time in 15 years, to save as much money as possible. I am lucky in that I have other talents to explore, and friends and relatives with unrelated businesses where I can always get a job in a pinch.<p>This might not be the right way for anyone else. However, I thought that since your symptoms are exactly the same as mine, I should share. I wish I would have figured this out for myself years sooner, as I could have saved myself a lot of frustration and unhappiness. Good luck.",1280113072

It's like I tell you about this cheap, underrated restaurant and you reply with ""but if everybody follows your recommendation, it will be too crowded and prices will rise and it won't be underrated anymore!"". Which is true, but it's not the case that everybody will suddenly go there.<p>If more people did technical degrees (and CS is not the only one) instead of liberal arts degrees, gradually the salaries for technical jobs would go down a little and salaries for liberal arts jobs would go up a little.<p>That said, I agree that more and more people getting university degrees -- whether due artificial legal requirements or societal expectations -- is not necessarily a good thing. In Japan, going to a trade school for 2~3 years and then getting a job is a common alternative to going to college or junior college.",1280113035

Having the idea in my head that CA is a warm place, I packed all shorts and short-sleeved shirts. San Francisco is <i>cold</i>! I ended up buying a thermal long-sleeved shirt and hoody when some friends and I decided to go to Ocean Beach.<p>Speaking of friends, I came to SF alone. I stayed at the Green Tortoise Hostel because at $30 per night, it was super affordable. I've met people here from all over the world. Last night at Ocean Beach, I was hanging out with a girl from England, 3 Irish, a Scottish guy, and an Italian girl. I highly recommend the hostel experience. If you're only here for a weekend, really try to minimize your computer/gadget usage and actually get to know people and the city.<p>As for some cool things I did yesterday -- I got a clam chowder bread bowl from Boudin's bakery and ate it while on a pier. I stopped at San Francisco Norman's and had some halo halo (it was ok), and while I was eating that I listened to a couple ladies playing some live acoustic guitar and singing. Nearby were a young guy and girl doing free abstract chalk portraits... they drew me, and then I joined them in drawing someone else<i>. I then walked through 
Ghiradelli Square, where I stopped to sketch Alcatraz, and I proceeded up to Fort Mason, stopping along the way to sketch the Golden Gate bridge from afar as the top disappeared into fog. I slowly went through the Fort Mason Community Garden, which was quite beautiful. On the way back to the hostel I stopped at Naia for some delicious gelato. Then we rode the N to Ocean City and had a fire on the beach.<p>I had four nights here, and it has gone way too quickly. I'd plan on staying here as long as you realistically can (advice that applies to any trip, really).<p></i> I'm far from an artist. I mentioned to the chalkers that they looked like they were having fun, and she said they were and that I should join them. It was great! As for the sketching, I didn't bring a camera, so I used a pen and memo pad to make the best sketch I could.",1280112966

 - carrots and hummus. super cheap, filling, hummus makes it a little more exciting than plain carrots, but not as unhealthy as ranch.
 - a jar of nuts. I prefer the lower-salt dry roasted peanuts to help satisfy my salty cravings.
 - goldfish crackers. this is my splurge item. I usually get the whole grain ones to feel better about myself.
 - i've also snacked on grapes, bananas, and other fruit as well.
 - for ""chocolate"" cravings sometimes I'll have a fiber one/fiber plus bar. nutrition-wise, they're not all that good for you, but its better than a candy bar. and the repercussions of the fiber will at least make you think twice before eating it in the office...<p>Bottom line: Figure out what you actually _need_ and not just what you're craving. Your body is smarter than you think about knowing what you need. I can typically classify my cravings as either ""protein"" (hummus/nuts), ""salty"" (nuts/goldfish), ""sweet"" (fruit), or just empty (ie lunchtime and/or carrots/fruit). I don't need a whole lot of variety, so as you can see, my short list of regulars double-covers most of these which is just fine for me (and easy to keep handy at work).",1280112264

Also note that Wikileaks withheld 15,000 “as part of a harm minimization process demanded by our source.""[6]<p>This tactic of ""the source said so"" is in itself untrustworthy as you can never verify the source. These are not forged or faked, however, withholding data is not being ""transparent"". Which is wikileaks mission.<p>Here is a better, IMO, review of the video and context leading up to the attack: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/bn5lg/badass_take_down_of_wikileaks_point_by_point/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/bn5lg/badass_take_...</a><p>I think George Brock said it best in his post entitled ""Julian Assange and the Wikileaks agenda"" where he wrote, ""Assange’s style is an odd mixture of insight, nonsense and brass-neck salesmanship""[2] The fact that Wikileaks has an agenda and are out to sell information to the highest bidder does not speak well, IMO[3]. If you are going to promote transparency be transparent your self.<p>The Wau Holland Foundation has told reporters that Wikileaks receives no money for personnel costs, only for hardware, travel and bandwidth, however they have not produced any detailed receipts for this[4]. As any charity should do- some are even required by law to do so.<p>On their twitter feed they call cryptome out for full primary sources, this is very hypocritical on their part[5]. Many of their problems did not start until Assange took the ""helm"", and many will not cease until he leaves.<p>They have also released bank numbers, addresses, SSN, and other private information on individuals(see BNP and Bank post). This is not necessary. You claim to ""fight the power"" then do it, do not hurt civilians along the way.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tcij.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tcij.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://georgebrock.net/?p=853"" rel=""nofollow"">http://georgebrock.net/?p=853</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://stefanmey.wordpress.com/2010/01/04/leak-o-nomy-the-economy-of-wikileaks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stefanmey.wordpress.com/2010/01/04/leak-o-nomy-the-ec...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.techeye.net/internet/wau-holland-foundation-sheds-light-on-wikileaks-donations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techeye.net/internet/wau-holland-foundation-sheds...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/17960055502"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/17960055502</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://security.unt.edu/aggregator/categories/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://security.unt.edu/aggregator/categories/1</a>",1280110854

There was no networking, only 8 bit sound and the vast majority of machines sold had no hard disk. What had been a groundbreaking platform in 1985 was looking decidedly long in the tooth by 1990.

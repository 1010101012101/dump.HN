1776634,comment,1776575,1776575,0,0,DevX101,,,"You don't know me and I'm just starting to post on HN, but I've read a bit of your writings and you're clearly a brilliant guy.  I recently saw a thread from a couple years ago where a few people made the flawed assertion that the aggregate rate of failure among entrepreneurs was uniform, and that your chances of success were also 10%, just like everyone else.  Your response basically said that you were quite confident you were better than the average entrepreneur, and that you were pretty sure you're on the right hand of the bell curve.<p>I actually admire that bravado in people who can walk the walk.  I'm not a fan of false humility.<p>All that being said, you seem to wear the solo-founder badge a bit too triumphantly.  I can't comment on the superiority of your solution versus competitors but I'll bet you can hold your own.  Getting someone on board who can SELL your story, and communicate your product to interested buyers would probably do wonders for your sales if you found the right guy.<p>Trust me, I see where you're coming from.  After a bad past experience myself, I am now a single founder building up my product in solitude.  But I know where my limits end, and when my product is ready to go to the next level, I'll have no problem bringing on a VETTED and qualified partner to grow the company as fast as possible.<p>Just a thought!",1286690307

1776627,comment,1775570,1775787,0,0,noibl,,,"Surely ""when I'm tired"" is one of the situations in which this tech should not be used. In Australia, for example, where long-distance driving is common, fatigue is one of the biggest contributors to road accident statistics.<p>Apart from the risk of someone actually falling asleep while the car is on auto-pilot, anything that reduces one's alertness over the duration of a drive makes this technology more dangerous (which is not to categorise it as dangerous).<p>The road recognition features would deal with simple cases like drifting out of lane but not so much in built-up areas or around unpredictable drivers. I think a big part of safe driving is adapting to accommodate the behaviour of other road users. Hopefully some tech will be developed in this area such as recognising inappropriate signalling, drifting out of lane, tailgating (ahead) etc.",1286689872

1776604,comment,1775584,1775641,0,0,dreeves,,,"For years, even decades, I've heard this cited as if it's a legal can of worms that makes the whole notion of automated driving a political impossibility, so to speak, in the foreseeable future.  Sure, it would save a lot of lives, the argument goes, but the rare failures would bring down a deluge of lawsuits that would crush any manufacturer foolish enough to try to mass-produce something like this.<p>I don't think that's the case, even taking as a given America's disgusting obsession with lawsuits.  There's an obvious answer to the liability question, and one that I think Google is already depending on in allowing their robot cars to drive all over California:  The person in the driver's seat is responsible as always.  That person can choose to press the autopilot button but it's not fundamentally different than cruise control.  Touching the brakes (or the steering wheel) immediately transfers control back to the driver.  The car is doing what it does, as always, strictly as the driver's proxy.<p>Now of course it will happen that some driver sues the manufacturer because there was an accident they believe wouldn't have happened if they'd never gone on autopilot.  Just like there have been (I blithely presume) lawsuits over cruise control.  But the manufacturer will weather those lawsuits and reasonable legal precedent will be established soon enough.<p>But now suppose you press autopilot, go to sleep, and wake up to find you've committed vehicular homicide.  That's a scary thought, but is it a potential dealbreaker in bringing this to the mass market?  I think the answer is no, because we've already established the liability question:  You were, officially and legally speaking, criminally negligent to go to sleep.  Unofficially it might well have been a perfectly reasonable risk to have taken, if the probability of it ending in tragegy is sufficiently low.  Logically, you could argue, citing statistics on human and robot drivers, that going to sleep with the car on autopilot was markedly less negligent than not putting the car on autopilot at all.  I don't know if that would fly in court.  But as far as legal obstacles to adoption of robot cars, I don't see it as much of an issue.<p>PS: I'm not a lawyer.",1286688343

1776597,comment,1774690,1775290,0,0,wanderr,,,"That story reminds me of my own heater core troubles. I had an old car that sprang a leak in the heater core, dumping antifreeze all over the inside of the car. The cost of having someone replace the heater core and ""do it right"" was more than the value of the car, and I live in Florida so heat is really only something it would be nice to have 2 or 3 days out of the year. I didn't use duct tape, but I did use a $2 part and some zip ties to bypass the heater core entirely. The car lasted me 3 more years until I got tired of the other problems it was developing and finally decided to give it to a friend.<p>What's the point of my story? Perhaps duct tape isn't always the best solution, but there are certainly times where the application of duct tape (or zip ties) is an appropriate response, the trick is identifying when and where, and being willing and able to do it when it makes sense.",1286687841

If that were the case, then they'd be limited by manpower, not money.<p>Colleges and universities would be going all-out to attract talent to climate science programs, in order to be able to staff lots of grants and get the fountains of government cash.

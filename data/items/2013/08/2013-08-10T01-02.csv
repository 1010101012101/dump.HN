But it would be much worse to fall back to a local business search, drop a pin on the result, and have  the user think that it was an actual geocoder result.<p>Intersection searches are rare, and there&#x27;s a limit to how large a set of queries you can have in a &quot;the results of these searches can never change&quot; golden set.

6189745,comment,6187014,6189640,1,0,jfarmer,,,"I co-founded Dev Bootcamp and while I was still there one of my not-so-secret missions was to make mathematics less alienating.  I only say that because <i>it was incredibly difficult</i>, even in an environment where I had complete autonomy and authority to make whatever curricular and pedagogical decisions I wanted.  The problem becomes combinatorially more complex in a public school where teachers have much less autonomy, have to teach to a common set of state-wide standards, and have students of varying levels of interest.<p>Here are my scattered thoughts, though.  I&#x27;m going to try to not suggest a pie-in-the-sky solution like &quot;new curriculum!&quot;<p>First, I majored in mathematics at the University of Chicago, but I hate, hate, <i>hated</i> mathematics in high school.  Take something you&#x27;d see in Algebra II like matrix multiplication, matrix inverses, and solving systems of linear equations.  You&#x27;re presented with these things called matrices and taught a bunch of rules.  Where did these rules come from?  Why are we calling this &quot;multiplication&quot; when it doesn&#x27;t look or act anything like multiplication?<p>And sure, I see that when I go through the steps you tell me to go through like a monkey I get an answer that works, but how do we know there aren&#x27;t more correct answers?  How did anyone even come up with these steps in the first place?  It&#x27;s not like someone sat down and tried a trillion random combinations of symbols and steps until one of them happened to work.<p>Augh.  In that world the only recourse for students is to memorize, usually just enough to do the homework or pass the test, and then promptly forget.  The only experience they associate with math is the utterly humiliating feeling of being terrible at it.<p>So, I think that&#x27;s one of the root problems.  People remember what they feel and most people remember feeling stupid, humiliated, and possibly ashamed when it comes to mathematics.  It&#x27;s only a matter of time before that becomes part of their identity.  &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m terrible at math.  Oh, I&#x27;m not smart enough to do math.&quot;  and so on.<p>If I were a HS math teacher my top priority would be to watch out for when those counterproductive, self-defeating beliefs were forming and do whatever I could to preempt them.<p>Second, I think the way math is taught is overly symbolic.  What most non-mathematicians don&#x27;t realize is that when most mathematicians look at a set of abstract symbols they don&#x27;t &quot;see&quot; the symbols <i>per se</i>, they see what those symbols are meant to represent.  They freely move between a geometric and algebraic picture of the world, but the algebraic picture is usually incredibly compressed.<p>I think the key thing is not to pick a side --  algebra vs. geometry -- but to show the relationship between the two.  Geometric objects admit a symbolic representation and vice versa.<p>Third, students have this idea that math is all about being &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, that it&#x27;s &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot;, that there&#x27;s some universe of Proper Math that is insisting on certain rules for no rhyme or reason<p>Here&#x27;s a silly but illustrative example that I think students would cover in 6th or 7th grade: order of operations.<p>Hey class!  Look at this expression: 4<i>5+6.  What does it equal?<p>A bad teacher says &quot;It&#x27;s 26 and any other answer is wrong.&quot;  An ok teacher says, &quot;Remember the order of operations.  If we apply those rules we get 26, so that&#x27;s the right answer.&quot;<p>A great teacher shows their students that some things are necessarily true and other things are definitionally (or conventionally) true.  This teacher would do something more like...<p>Who got 26?  Who got 44?  Students who said the answer was 26, how did the students who got 44 arrive at their answer?  Students who said the answer was 44, how did the students who said 26 arrive at their answer?  Neither of you are wrong </i>per se<i>.  We could have chosen to live in either world, but we have to choose one consistent set of rules.<p>These rules lead us to 26.  If we chose the other set of rules, we&#x27;d get at 44.  We only do this because we don&#x27;t want to have to write down parentheses all the time, but without them it&#x27;s unclear what order we&#x27;re supposed to apply + and </i>.  So we need to agree on a set of rules so that two people looking at the same expression both understand how to make sense of it.<p>It&#x27;s like traffic laws.  There&#x27;s nothing stopping people from driving on the left side of the road.  In fact, there are countries where everyone does drive on the left side of the road.  The important thing is that everyone agrees on a convention -- left-side or right-side.  It works as long as everyone agrees and breaks if people don&#x27;t.<p>I could go on, but I&#x27;ll stop here.  Like I said, these are my scattered thoughts. :)",1376099423

The building is also impressive, from some century-ago world&#x27;s fair. The rest of the exhibits, on the other hand, range from good to being quite obviously 100 years old with no love given in the preceding century (sometimes this is nice and quaint, sometimes annoying). It feels more impressive to me than HMNS, but HMNS might have better exhibits. The latter certainly has a nice gem collection.<p>But if you want something more sciencey, the Museum of Science and Industry is really nice. There&#x27;s an entire simulation of a coal mine you can go down into, exhibits on the history of trains, on urban history, and on the history of agriculture, and even a captured German U-505 submarine.

If the police are wrong, our self-defense moves instead into the realm of courts and law (setting aside the flaws with those systems).<p>However, extreme abuses of police power change the equation. While there are obviously reasonable circumstances for a cop to execute you without trial (when you are posing an immediate danger), there are effectively zero circumstances where you are allowed to physically defend yourself against the police.<p>I&#x27;m not necessarily advocating that there should be a circumstance when it&#x27;s okay to shoot a cop; rather, that there are behavioral and social side effects from that intrinsic asymmetry, which affects the relationship between the necesseties of state violence, the legal system that supports them, and the civilians caught in the middle, innocent or otherwise.<p>I&#x27;ve also been thinking about it in the context of drones and anti-insurgent warfare. In conventional war, the enemy is dehumanized generally, but no one is demonized for shooting back: it&#x27;s expected behavior. But in the context of quasi-occupation, civilians have neither legal nor physical recourses for defense. Picking up a weapon automatically marks you as the enemy; your only defense is to do nothing and hope that your drone pilot is accurate and merciful. The typical rhetoric is that terrorists are the worst of the worst because they are willing to kill civilians, which I would agree with; yet wielding a gun against a uniformed soldier or even a drone effectively marks you as a terrorist all the same.<p>I don&#x27;t own guns, and never plan to; while I&#x27;m not a knee-jerk pacifist, it&#x27;s very important to me never to take a life, a pledge I would only break in the most extreme of circumstances. But I certainly hold a great deal of empathy for those who feel the need to take personal defense into their own hands, and I believe there is a solid case for seeing self-defense as an inalienable human right.<p>(At this point, I wonder if the best self-defense at home or abroad might be to capture or stream video 24 hours a day...)",1376097790

In reality there&#x27;s no match for the geocoding search [34th and 6th ave ny,ny], so it is interpreted as a local search for [34th and] in the vicinity of [6th ave ny, ny].<p>Why isn&#x27;t there a match for the geocoding search? It&#x27;s not because somebody &quot;destroyed Google Maps on iOS&quot;, but most likely just due to a switch to a newer geocoding index. These would be updated frequently with new data from all kinds of sources, just like web search won&#x27;t use a static index but one that changes over time.<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t this kind of change be noticed when changing to a new set of data? Because it&#x27;d be essentially impossible to find all possible changes to geocoding results from a data change, and even less feasible to verify which of the results are correct. So there&#x27;s always going to be some kind of sampling going on when validating new data or code changes. And with a sensibly sized sample, you&#x27;re not very likely to be checking a particular intersection in a very large country.<p>These kinds of regressions would have popped in and out during the whole lifetime of Google Maps.

How can you apply this stuff if you still have to teach a standard curriculum?<p>I&#x27;m really asking -- my friend is about to start as a high-school math teacher.<p>I guess the first recommendation would be: motivate every new technique by starting with one or more problems that the technique helps to solve. (Here &quot;problems&quot; is meant in the Lockhart sense -- real puzzles, not exercises.)<p>But how often are &quot;techniques&quot; actually taught in high school math, especially algebra and precalculus? A lot of high school math consists of digesting new definitions, or the generalization of old definitions. A fair amount of it consists of learning theorems that go unproven, or that are proven (by the teacher) too quickly for students to understand where they come from -- and in general it isn&#x27;t satisfying to solve a puzzle with a theorem that one doesn&#x27;t actually understand.<p>On top of that... students have to spend time with problems before they become genuinely interested in their solutions, so progress would be slower with this method. It&#x27;s not clear that you could teach a whole year&#x27;s curriculum in one year like this. (And if you fail to do that you&#x27;ll eventually get fired.)<p>Any insight? I believe that it&#x27;s possible to teach math, even standard high school curriculum, in such a way that students are at all times intrinsically interested in what&#x27;s presented. But it would be awfully hard to do at scale, at the standard pace, as a high school teacher would have to. How might a teacher start in that direction?",1376097250

For the Euclidean algorithm to work, you need to be able to divide two elements and produce a remainder that&#x27;s smaller than the divisor.<p>So an ED requires a notion of &quot;smallness&quot; (the Euclidean norm) which interacts with division in a way that makes the Euclidean algorithm work (remainder is always smaller than divisor).<p>A principal ideal domain is an integral domain where every ideal is principal (can be generated by one element).  It can be useful for you to know that certain situations cannot happen, e.g. in a PID you can say, &quot;Let I be an ideal of D, then I = <g>...&quot; and do something with the generating element g.  It lets you pass from an ideal to a single generating element in a proof, which may be a useful capability.  The PID concept is also part of a taxonomy, since Euclidean domains  principal ideal domains.",1376096436

This is a huge bureaucracy, and softening even this much in a few short months is an amazing thing.

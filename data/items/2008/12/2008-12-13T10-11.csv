</code></pre>
That's a silly consensus. Of all the billions of people who have ever lived, there's no evidence of anything leaving, or anywhere for it to go, or any reasonable sounding conjectures of what it might be made of or how it is powered or how it interacts with living brainmatter during life or any reasonable sounding suggestions for what happens in the event that the body dies with advanced alzheimers or as a foetus or in the fires of a nuclear bomb detonation or trapped in an inescapable airtight diving bell...<p><pre><code>  If the materialist explanation of consciousness is correct, then it's plausible that ""someone"" will awaken when your body is resurrected and will have your memories, but it won't be you, because you won't exist to be experiencing it.
</code></pre>
Of course it will be ""me"". If the materialist explanation is correct there isn't anyone else it could be or any way for it to be anyone else or any separate ""me"" that could not exist to experience it.<p>But it isn't quite right to say it will <i>be me</i>. Rather, <i>I will be it</i>. I wont waken when my body is resurrected, when my body is thawed and jump started, the processes that <i>are me</i> will be running again. An animated body is a thinking body and this particular body is me. I am not a thing that exists separately from my neurological processes, ""I"" am the result of the neurological processes.",1229165708

Swoopo mentions entertainment as well, but they also make people believe that they are buying a product for a good price, which is clearly not the case.<p>So as a (potential) customer I'm taking note that this company is using deceptive tactics, claiming one thing and structuring their system to do something else. Yes they do it openly, so it's up to everyone to not buy from them and to remember not to buy from this company and the people behind it ever again.",1229165627

The reason it's still legally random is that it's as good as random from the point of view of the player. Same applies here. No?",1229165554

396630,comment,396596,396626,0,0,davidw,,,"As an American living in Europe, I think there are things to be learned on both sides.  I completely agree with things like health care, or things to protect people to some degree if they lose their jobs.  What doesn't work in ""Europe"" (please not, however, that there are different systems within Europe) are some of the rigid labor laws, and the high barrier to entry for people wishing to create new companies.<p>... a little bit later ...<p>I wrote something about it myself, as it's a topic that's quite important to me:<p><a href=""http://journal.dedasys.com/2008/12/13/startups-and-work-europe-vs-the-us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.dedasys.com/2008/12/13/startups-and-work-euro...</a>",1229165288

People would eventually associate their battery life with the list of programs running or installed, and would be able to make more informed choices about which apps to install and/or use.  It would also give an incentive to app programmers to not be so aggressive, as their aggressive app will be associated with low battery life or unresponsive UI.<p>An app that uses GPS could tie into the time of day and week and change its polling frequency based on a pattern of past movement behavior.  If it sees a pattern that everyday between 11am and 1pm it has bigger changes in location than in the morning or afternoon, your lunch trip would be updated more often.  Or with accelerometer support could detect that that is not moving and poll for location less frequently. I'm sure some apps are already doing stuff like this.",1229164598

The French may not work 60-hour weeks, but at least they have the good sense to make the most of the time they've been granted on the planet.  What do most Americans live for?  Buying cheap crap at WalMart?  Buying better crap than the guy next door?<p>I could care less that the ""best"" web2.0 companies are based in the US, when those companies are <i>laying people off</i> right now.  Their former employees will have to enter the worst job market in nearly 30 years, without health care to protect them if they get sick, or basic social programs to keep their children from going hungry.  I think that's an awful, brutal, unfair system, and I'd gladly trade a little bit of ""competitiveness"" for a bit more compassion.",1229164074

Perhaps all auction sites should be audited, but I don't see how this one is any worse than the rest.<p>And sadly the licensing requirements for online casinos are a joke. Read up on the Kahnawakee Gaming Commission some time, you'll get a kick out of it. Until we legalize and regulate them, they'll never improve.",1229163583

But they are still failures. Capitalism depends on such failures being fewer than those cases where funds go where value is being created.",1229163498

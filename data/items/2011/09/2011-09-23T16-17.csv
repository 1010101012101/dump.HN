3030656,comment,3029922,3030225,1,0,nirvana,,,"My background is in physics and one of my first programming jobs was writing code for a lab of international importance.  At the time, I would engage the other members of the lab in an ongoing debate about Einstein, where I'd take the position that Einstein was wrong (About anything, or everything, whatever the handy topic was.)  I was, and am, an Einsteinian skeptic.<p>I learned a lot in that, and one thing that actually surprised me is that in many cases, I was able to make a good argument that Einstein was wrong, and there was no empirical evidence to support his view on the particular point we were discussing.<p>The point of that is not that I believe Einstein was wrong.  It is that this is not a situation where any single experimental result can show that the theory doesn't hold, or does hold.  There are many experiments where his theories do seem to hold (though I enjoyed poking holes in them).  If this result is repeatable and turns out to be correct, it will cause many physicists to re-evaluate many theories, and have huge implications.<p>Einsteins work resulted in many theories, and of course a grand set of them called relativity (and special relativity)... the media simplifies this to ""nothing can move faster than the speed of light"".<p>I can see the situation where this causes an adjustment in the specific interpretations of his theories.  Or it could turn out that these results are both true, and consistent with his theories.  For instance, prior to the understanding of matter there were many theories about mass that are essentially true on the macroscopic scale, though once you understand that matter is made up of atoms you see where they don't hold on the microscopic scale.<p>This result could reveal a level of reality beyond what Einstein understood, such that he's right from our macroscopic scale, but there's a whole other branch of physics in there.<p>So, I'm not declaring victory. I think this is good news, though, because it might be the beginning of the revelation of an error in understanding that, when resolved, results in a big jump forward in physics.<p>PS- I'm not interested in getting into a physics debate.  Its been too many years, and I've spoken vaguely because the specifics are not what I'm addressing.",1316796852

3030651,comment,3029771,3029771,6,0,kposehn,,,"I've been a successful duo-founder (my wife is my business partner) for 3.5 years now. We started in affiliate marketing and have slowly added agency services and now software (we founded a newer company for that with a few business partners).<p>I've been working for myself full-time ever since we started and income is great. The last two years have been well in to the six figures and growth is excellent, allowing us to live comfortably here in San Diego with a great house. However, there are a few pitfalls to the marketing business...<p>Primarily, we found that affiliate marketing, while high-margin in theory, is so extremely competitive and dirty that your entire livelihood hangs by a thread. Google can slap your site, search algorithm changes can sandbox you and unscrupulous affiliates can and will copy your entire site wholesale and use it to compete directly with you. Google, the affiliate networks they use and ISP's will do absolutely nothing (one of the reasons for my ire with all of them as far as SEO/PPC goes) which made us resort to retaining legal counsel to slam people as soon as it crops up.<p>Our entire growth on the affiliate side has been Facebook and Mobile where our margins are often 300-400% as opposed to the slimmer 60-100% margins on AdWords. However, being in such a competitive and bleeding-edge field has meant that our agency clients get the benefit of that experience. We can often muscle a new client into highly a competitive segment and get them profiting quickly; we live the mindset of ""if it doesn't make money, don't do it"".<p>We ended up making our newer software company with a few co-founders because our overall growth there is better, margins are great, security is better and we have <i>assets</i>. You can't easily sell an affiliate web site, but you can build a software company that is very appealing to sell.<p>It has been a hell of an experience and I'm considering writing a series about it once we release our new app. Hopefully can bring the benefit of our blood/sweat/tears-and-such to the rest of HN :)",1316796803

I'm not convinced that their home grown m/r is a better option.<p>They mentioned the ""global javascript interpreter lock"", which may be slightly inaccurate, but it's true that you can only run one m/r job per mongod instance at a time. It's relatively easy to get around that, though, since you can have replica sets and run jobs on the slave members.

This happened in biology re: critics of evolution (in the anti-evolution camps there are tons of complaints about censorship, refusal to address criticisms, provide data, share models and code, etc.), and whereas it's always <i>possible</i> to address criticisms, the other side is always willing to spend more money to poke new ""holes"" in the theory, and you'll just never win.<p>""Skeptics"" like to portray the ultimate goal of science as if it's to continually try to poke holes in existing theories, because progress is made when theories are disproven.  But that's not science.  Science is when you mix a desire to poke holes in theories with a reasonable threshold of acceptance, a willingness to step back and say ""Okay, we've spent a lot of energy coming up with arguments as to why this is wrong, and they've been addressed satisfactorily, so this is probably right, let's see if this takes us anywhere new rather than getting stuck arguing the point"".<p>Climate skeptics lack the willingness, even in theory, to accept that enough is enough - I don't believe for one moment that there is, even in principle, any piece of evidence that would lessen the amount of criticism against AGW.  I don't believe they would give in because we've already seen that no amount of evidence reduced the amount of anti-evolution noise, and it's by and large the same sources of funding and political motivation that's behind both movements.<p>Now, it very well may be the case that climate scientists also lack the willingness to admit that they're wrong (actually, I think this is pretty likely), in which case they're not doing science, either, and that's bad.  I'm totally in agreement there.<p>But they're taking exactly the approach to the skeptics that they would (and arguably, should) be taking if they <i>were</i> doing proper science.  So the way they deal with skeptics is not a point of evidence either for or against the honesty of their scientific investigations, it's merely an inevitable result of the politicization of their field.",1316796125

Patents are being issued to companies for inventions that are, in fact, common knowledge included in any introductory software textbook.  The result is that the large software corporations are buying up reams of patents and using them to bully small, innovative companies out of business or into paying ridiculous licensing fees.<p>Quite apart from encouraging innovation, patents are now stifling it.<p>The software industry is one of the few industries still strong in America.  Even in a time of recession, there are not enough computer programmers to fill all the available positions.  Startup companies are forming and growing readily.  But if every line of code written brings with it a potential violation of someone else's intellectual property, this will cease to be the case.<p>To solve this problem, we petition the Obama Administration to direct the Patent office to cease issuing software patents and to void all existing software patents.

From the moon race to the period of the XPrize, and even after, NASA and the FCC has stymied private access to space. It is hard to test a launch vehicle if you can't get a launch or even testing (e.g.: static firing) permits.  It is hard to start a space tourism business if the person developing your vehicles is barred from showing the CEO of the company the designs (as happened to Virgin Galactic for a couple years because Richard Branson is not a US citizen!)<p>This should resonate really well with anyone building a startup.  A startup is a money engine.  You find something that is profitable, and you invest in it and grow it.<p>You can go out and spend a lot of money doing things the manual way, but if everything pretty much stops when you stop spending money, you're not really investing in a sustainable business.<p>This is the case with NASA and a lot of government programs.  We were spending a lot of money, but we were not building a space industry... in fact, because government bureaucrats saw space as a competitive advantage (NASA, for instance, long enjoyed easy funding from Congress) they worked to stymie private interests that might show them up.<p>It is great that things are changing now.  We have SpaceX building launch vehicles. Virgin Galactic will start their business any day now (hopefully, though remember how congress wanted to shut it down because it might not be ""safe""?) Jeff Bezos is doing something off in the desert of west texas, and even John Carmack has a small space business.<p>But we cannot ignore the legacy of hundreds of billion sunk into NASA on unsustainable programs, and quirky launch vehicles designed to meet bureaucratic needs, such as to at least have one component of it built in each of the 50 states.<p>So, the news that NASA is in an ""embarrassing"" state to me, is good news.

My view is that even if they got a nice description of 'another Google' in their e-mail in-box, they would ignore it.<p>To me, it looks like the VCs are consistently the dumbest people in the room.  They are not the people I respected in graduate school or at Yorktown Heights and are nearly never someone I would hire as Chief Scientist, CTO, CIO, Software Manager, Software Developer, User Interface Designer, DBA, Server Farm Administrator, Network Architect, Network Analyst, Network Manager, or CFO.<p>Beyond the bad financial returns, here is one point of evidence:  As we can see in the article, often the VCs think in terms of simplistic and nearly meaningless patterns.  What they appear to be looking at, believing in, and acting on is evidence hardly better than tea leafs.  Even more seriously, in IT (the situation in biomedical might be much different) the VCs don't have even as much as a weak little hollow hoot of a tiny clue what to look at or how to evaluate projects.  Borrowing from a movie, ""They are digging in the wrong place."".<p>For more on the patterns, there is ""Cold-calling our office line."".  That this is bad is definitely looking at patterns in tea leafs and as silly as the evidence, say, in 'The Music Man' of a boy buckling his knickerbockers BELOW his knee.  Even more seriously, it is usually just crucial to 'cold call the office line' to pass a message to the VC that did send an e-mail; the VCs are so bad at handling e-mail that otherwise the e-mail is almost surely due to RIP in the bit bucket.<p>More evidence is in the ""Saying they are completely unique, and that there is no competition.  Groan."".  Groan back to you, doofus.  VC, if you are reading this and are insulted, fine with me:  No good IT entrepreneur should dare to have you on their Board.<p>So, a standard VC claim is ""Whatever idea you have, at least a dozen other people have had the same idea and are working on executing it."".  Let's examine this claim:  So, for an idea, take all the people so far who have thought of it and, for each such person, take the time and date when they first did think of it.  Now, sort that data into ascending order on time and date and look at the first person from the sort; almost surely (probability 1) that person thought of the idea first, before anyone else, and, thus, is a contradiction to the claim.  Done.<p>More generally, the claim is just nonsense:  Indeed, essentially all of peer-reviewed research is judged on the criteria of new, correct, and significant.  If there were no new ideas, then there should be no new peer-reviewed papers, but each year there are many thousands of such papers.  Moreover, over nearly any 10 year interval, we can find very powerful, new results we would not want to be without.<p>So, the VC claim of nothing new is uninformed, misinformed, ignorant, arrogant, and just plain wrong.<p>Really, the claim is from a strong desire of a VC to trivialize and denigrate entrepreneurs and their work.  For the poor returns, we have just identified one sufficient condition.<p>Similarly, a common VC claim is, ""Ideas are easy.  Execution is hard."".  No, good ideas are hard and then successful execution is routine!<p>Execution?  The US is just awash in millions of businesses, coast to coast, on Main Street that do execution quite well, thank you.  The US is also awash in people who have done well managing groups from a dozen to 1000 dozen persons in, say, business, government, the military, etc.  In the US, good execution is common.<p>Good execution is so common that even VCs can understand a lot about execution.  Moreover, in the work of a CEO, execution is about all the VCs understand.  So, the VCs are willing to say that what they do know, execution, is difficult.<p>But the VCs definitely do NOT understand finding good, new ideas and, thus, dismiss that work as ""easy"".  Dumb.  Part of the reason for the VC problem with 'ideas' is that one could count with shoes still on all the VCs in the country who have published a peer-reviewed paper in an archival journal of original research or who are qualified for a tenure track faculty position in a technical field in a research university or as a problem sponsor in NSF or DARPA.<p>Then there's the common ""Using a banker to raise money or sending in something over the transom (cold e-mail).  Good entrepreneurs can always find a warm intro to a VC.""<p>So, it is common on venture firm Web sites to advise an entrepreneur to get an introduction via a lawyer, banker, or VC portfolio CEO.  So, this VC wants to rule out any entrepreneur who gets an introduction from a banker.<p>Next, the ""over the transom (cold e-mail)"" is another favorite way for VCs to denigrate the work of entrepreneurs.  That denigration is just posturing, playing 'hard to get' because as is easy to see for nearly all VCs it is easy enough to get their e-mail address and phone number, send them e-mail, and leave them a phone message.<p>The worst is the ""Good entrepreneurs can always find a warm intro to a VC.""  Nonsense.  Total 100% reeking, fuming, bubbling, sticky, toxic nonsense.  Here VCs are breaking their arms patting themselves on their backs about how 'well connected' they are.  Nonsense.  Also they are asking their 'friends' to do their work for them.  In fact, VCs are very poorly connected with some of the very best sources of 'good' entrepreneurs!  I met and worked with a lot of 'good' people, some who became good entrepreneurs, in graduate school, as a university professor, and at Yorktown Heights, but in those places I never met anyone who became a VC.  In particular, VCs are NOT very technical and, thus, are not well connected with entrepreneurs with high technical qualifications.<p>Actually, we know a lot about how to conceive of good, new projects to field valuable results to markets.  There is a long, astoundingly successful history of such projects in applied math, applied science, engineering, and technology, and IT, in both business and the US DoD.  The VC simplistic, ignorant pattern matching is ignoring this history.  Dumb.<p>Here is a fact that should wake up each VC like 50 gallons of ice water over their heads:  Look at the 'home run hits' of the past few decades and see Apple, Twitter, GroupOn, Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Cisco, HP, Oracle, Dell, Microsoft, Intel, Sun, IBM.  Now, find the 'pattern' in these!  May I have the envelope, please?  Here it is:  The pattern is, there isn't one!  Instead, have to look at such case one by one.  More generally, fundamentally, nearly necessarily, are looking for things that are NEW.  Sorry 'bout the difficulty of working with things that are new!<p>The VCs, then, have been blinded by their 100-200 daily e-mail messages:  Their job is to find golden needles in a lot of straw, but their 'pattern matching' is based on what lessons they draw looking at the straw and not the needles.<p>Really, nearly all VC remarks on what they want is nonsense to cover over what they really want.  What they really want is an opportunity to make a lot of money easily.  Their main idea is to wait for an entrepreneur to do really well but start a vast project with half-vast planning, run out of cash, and be willing to take a VC check with some really onerous terms.  So, fundamentally they are eager to pursue 'vulture capital'.  But, vultures eat dead meat and, net, are not very successful.<p>This VC business model is not working well.  Reasons:<p>(1) The VCs evaluate the projects not at all like a serious CEO would but much like an accountant would.  E.g., the VCs want to see 'traction' significant and rising quickly.  That's about as deep into anything meaningful as the VCs get.  So, really, the VCs look at an egg or a chick without enough 'diligence' to tell if the species is a chicken, pigeon, or eagle.  Dumb.<p>(2) The VCs are looking for projects that DO have 'traction' but also have some poor planning.  NOT good.<p>Thankfully for US national security, VCs are not NSF or DARPA problem sponsors!",1316794213

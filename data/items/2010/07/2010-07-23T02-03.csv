Anyone who is concerned about the loss of Chinese culture is invited to spend their <i>own</i> time mastering it and passing it on. Complaining that culture is being lost is, if you really unpack it, just a way of insisting that a billion other people burn their lives away using an inefficient writing system so that <i>you</i> can feel good about their culture. It's obviously not what <i>they</i> want to do, or they'd be doing it.<p>Culture is living things, like butterflies. It's good to pin a few down for the museum, but on the whole they needs to be left to roam free. This is not sadness; this is <i>life</i>.

Just because most humans do something by default doesn't mean it's an optimal solution. Many things that people do by default are a result of environmental training but are not necessarily optimal behavior (here in China people juggle walnuts between their fingers in an effort to ward of arthritis, but as far as I can tell that behavior is just as likely to encourage arthritis as protect against it).<p>I also attended Dr. Dement's Sleep and Dreams class while I was at Stanford. His class was basically a propaganda program for students to get more sleep: He even gave us extra credit for sleeping during class. The man is a true believer in getting tons of sleep and that does indeed say a lot towards discrediting people who vouch for polyphasic sleep schedules.

1540189,comment,1539783,1540076,0,0,bff,,,"This is actually an active research area so a google scholar search can turn up interesting stuff from various security conferences. Here's a summary of what I've read and heard about:<p>If a chip has unecrypted personal data stored on it an attacker can easily gain access to it by stealing the device. If encryption is used throughout the chip then side channel attacks can usually break the encryption. This requires something like an oscilloscope, some resistors, and a soldering iron. The danger of this attack to a consumer depends upon what's stored on the RFID chip since the consumer will notice if someone has stolen their device and will have it disabled in short order.<p>To clone a tag that doesn't use encryption, for instance a tag that just sends an ID, you'd need a reader to query the tags and some device to copy the responses. This is probably the easiest attack but the reader, which needs to transmit a strong radio pulse and then listen for a response, either needs to be very large or in very close proximity and you could protect a card in your wallet by surrounding it in a metal mesh (which forms a faraday cage) so it's not clear how dangerous this could be in the wild.<p>If the communcation channel is encrypted then an attacker could listen to the query and response from a legitimate reader and RFID tag and could then replicate the legitimate response later. However, if there is any timestamp or counter involved this won't work.",1279852961

1540186,comment,1540036,1540150,0,0,Jd,,,"Muscle memory was entirely neglected and is, in many aspects, the most important ""memory"" for writing Chinese characters, esp. under time pressure. The way that characters can be reconstructed that are ""forgotten"" by your Chinese speaker is simply that they go back to their visually retained memory of what the character looks like and then render it piece by piece. I've seen this happen to a Chinese lawyer friend of mine who was Peking University grad -> Harvard JD (not a dumb cookie), but after time in an English speaking law firm tripped up when asked to write even simple phrases that I, a foreigner, could still write fairly easily.<p>As for your problems learning the language, there is no other way other than rot memorization, and if you don't have the time, you shouldn't even bother. Seriously. If you can make the time but don't have the temperament, go somewhere where they will beat it into you Chinese-style, because there really is no other way to memorize the thousands of characters necessary to be proficient in Chinese.

Now write a program to actually find the number in question, including all input (in this case, some representation of the number you gave, which itself can be encoded as something less than the raw base 2 representation). Now, convert that program to the most efficient possible representation in the Turing Machine encoding in question, which for these sorts of problems are often surprisingly small.<p>Your problem fits into a small handful of states, a few tens tops, and relatively small ""input"" too (as encoded by the states in some manner). Therefore BB(a few tens) is at least that large. In fact, that's an unbelievable underestimation of BB(a few tens).<p>While we humans are thinking we're all clever stacking exponentials on exponentials, the Busy Beavers are off doing things we can't even conceive. Arrow notation and hyper arrow notation and every other such bit of notation are all very, very small functions, and therefore well covered by BB(very small); what concept or concepts does BB(50) exploit? Certainly nothing that would fit into English very comfortably.<p>I think this helps a human to grasp BB() at least a little; the cleverest, biggest numbers we've ever managed to express without the BB notation are usually in the form of functions quite easy to express with Turing Machines of not that many states.

It's much more efficient to have each character represent a sound (western way) than a word (Chinese/Japanese/etc way), anyway. The cultural loss is sad, sure, but in the end, it's survival of the fittest.",1279850803

1540150,comment,1540036,1540036,0,0,GiraffeNecktie,,,"It's an interesting article for me because right now I'm trying to learn Chinese. I'm mostly interested in learning to speak the language, but I've discovered that it really helps to be able to read as well. Chinese has a very small palette of sounds, which means that there's a lot of ambiguity. The same sound and tone could be represented by many different characters and have many different meanings.<p>But there's no way I can do the traditional approach of writing out each character hundreds and hundreds of times. I don't have the time or temperament. So I'm hoping a combination of flashcards and watching TV (most Chinese programs seem to have Chinese script subtitles, I assume to serve the various dialects that share the writing system) will do the trick.<p>That's one issue the article didn't fully address: the importance of that muscle memory in learning and retaining the characters.",1279850627

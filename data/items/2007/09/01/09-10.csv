Ouch. Your typical literary agent gets 100s of manuscripts a day, and accepts maybe 10 a year. (Much, much worse odds than applying a yc).<p>Obviously, the facebook idea was old, old, old even when Zuck got to it, so of course he's no innovator. Just threw the dice and won. (Plus, he's probably a good operator, despite his assholism).",1188640620

During that time, I listened to everything at venturevoice.com, read Founders at Work, and kept thinking ""man, these success stories are inspiring, but what I need right now are some goddamn failure storiesX.""  (If you're in the same position, I highly recommend this book: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/362eg5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/362eg5</a> )  <p>Anyways, you're both right.  <i>Founders at Rest: Stories of Losers Who Fucked Up and Gave Up</i> would be boring and depressing.  But interviews with successful people about their failures -- e.g., Evan Williams' Blogger saga -- would be fascinating and inspiring.  The classic story arc doesn't let the hero succeed right off the bat.  First he hits a low point, then pulls himself up by his bootstraps.<p>One of these days I'll write that book.  Right now, though, I'm too busy working on my next startup.<p>Don't forget, Microsoft wasn't Bill Gates' first company.",1188640282

49187,comment,48770,49184,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Internet debate gets a bad rep, but it's intrinsically no worse than any other written debate (which in and of itself is certainly the highest form of discourse man has ever invented). Sincere internet debate is perhaps 50% of what makes the medium useful (the other 50% being, of course, videos of kittens). Insincere internet debate is unfortunately 99% of the overall market and often clouds that fact. So if anything, there's your unified theory of sincerity.<p>As for one true conception, I imagine it exists on many topics, though getting at it is rather tricky. I've certainly started to argue with people before only to find out, as I put it in writing, that I agreed with them, sometimes even for reasons they'd missed. So if the truth is so convoluted that you can never really know it, perhaps it functionally does not exist.<p>I now feel my counter argument to the sincerity thing is overhyped though. I don't have enough time to make it live up. Please don't read, you'll only be let down. <p>",1188637267

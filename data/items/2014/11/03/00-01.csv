The conquistadors proved as much. As they colonized South America, they brought with them European strains of Helicobacter pylori, a stomach bacterium that infrequently causes ulcers and stomach cancer, and these European strains also displaced native American ones. This legacy persists in Colombia, where some communities face a 25-fold higher risk of stomach cancer, most likely due to mismatches between their ancestral genomes and their H. pylori strains.",1414976309

Now you’re on to the next cool language, which might not be used 5 years from now. You constantly have to stay on top of things.&quot;</i><p>In most areas of programming, there&#x27;s no need to chase the next hot language. Many of the languages being used today, such as Python, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, C++ and C have been around for a very long time. Outside of web and mobile development, the frameworks and libraries don&#x27;t change that quickly.<p><i>&quot;There’s a ton of stuff you need to know, and it keeps changing!

For example, if your weekend project is writing a program to do electronic music composition on a PC or a Mac, you&#x27;ll be pretty much unaffected by the trends in languages and frameworks.

Westerners on the highways could interact with Easterners, but their trip was monitored at check points, down to how much time they took for the journey, to make sure they weren&#x27;t fraternizing too much.<p>Apparently the GDR, who was bearing the cost of the transit roads and was facing economic difficulties, began levying fees on travel from West Berlin and West Germany. They tried to increase these fees, but eventually the FRG, probably realizing it was over a barrel on the issue, just started paying the GDR a yearly fee to keep the roads toll free.<p>The flight travel bit is interesting.

8548782,comment,8548163,8548759,0,0,WildUtah,,,"That&#x27;s not true at all. California cops can make $200k a year cash just with overtime and incentives. Including pension schemes and other benefits, it&#x27;s common for mid-career CA cops to make upwards of $500k.<p>Consider that 25 year CHP officers can collect lifetime pensions at the highest pay, including overtime accumulated from previous years and cashed out. At a US inflation adjusted bond discount rate of 0-1% typical over the past decade and usual life expectancy tables, that adds up to 1.5-3 extra years of pay in pension benefits for each year of service. That&#x27;s computed according to what you&#x27;d have to put into a 401(k) to pay for the pension; the state of California is putting somewhat less into CalPERS and hoping to get bailed out by private sector taxpayers or the Federal Government someday. (CA isn&#x27;t doing as badly as MA or IL or some others on pension funding, though)<p>NYC is paying much more rationally and budgeting better than other big city and coastal governments which is one reason there are enough cops there to keep order.",1414975096

At its heart, the foodie movement is the complex jumble of things the author mentions. Politics, art, identity, history, etc. But it&#x27;s also highly supported by people with excess income. So some of this critique seems to warrant further investigation. On the other hand, many of these movements actually are dipping into techniques from a previous era and different social strata. For instance pickling, home preserves, raising your own chickens, etc. Many of these things are actually able to co-exist with urban density, and many more can be if urban planning was adjusted in certain respects.<p>Additionally, I think many who focus on the quality of food would argue the world can&#x27;t afford to feed the future 11 billion-peopled world using current agricultural practices. Economically, cheap transportation costs prop up various agricultural bread baskets, and will likely see future disruption as oil availability fluctuates. Other places, like California, require more water than is actually locally available. Some would also question the environmental cost of modern ag processes. From pesticide use to deforestation, agricultural use is often at the core of human&#x27;s environmental impact in an area.<p>The foodie/locavore/in-season movement all have various things to offer to this debate.

Because you can&#x27;t start a text search in a background thread, and work with other files while that&#x27;s running.  Etc.<p>You know, about once or twice per day I have to do a text search through a 750,000-line codebase.  IntelliJ blocks also, but it completes in 3 to 4 seconds... and Vim searches a hell of lot faster than IntelliJ.  In two decades of working with vi/Vim, I&#x27;ve only experienced UI sluggishness when working with log files that were each hundreds of megs in size.<p>So to be clear, when I suggested that you might use too many plugins, that was sarcasm.  To be even more clear, I was flatly calling you a liar about your original premise.<p>Synchronous vs. asynchronous plugin execution is not an &quot;architectural shortcoming&quot;.  It&#x27;s an &quot;architectural decision&quot;.  An architectural shortcoming is something that two separate submitters can&#x27;t each resolve with a single patch.  Right or wrong, the Vim maintainers were given the option... and apparently made the conscious decision that the benefits of asynchronous plugin execution aren&#x27;t worth the risk of plugin authors doing dumb things with it.<p>I do wish that they had been more forthcoming with your company in how they did (or didn&#x27;t) convey that decision, but ultimately it&#x27;s their call.  Creating or supporting a fork is likewise your call.  But at least be honest about the agenda.  You guys take an active interest in criticizing Vim, and promoting NeoVim, because the Vim maintainers rejected a patch that would help your startup company integrate with them.  Not because the syntax highlighter can&#x27;t keep up with your Warp 9 typing.",1414973669

But I have to respond to one of your points, that you take issue with people who wish to use the title &#x27;Doctor&#x27; when they aren&#x27;t medical doctors.<p>The term itself comes from the Latin &#x27;docere&#x27; - to teach - and goes back to before the first European universities. The title of Doctor for physicians and surgeons is much more recent, and was actually a status-elevating maneuver. Even today, in the UK and countries that follow that system, a surgeon is called &#x27;Mister&#x27; and a physician, who is called &#x27;Doctor&#x27;, will have an Bachelor of Medicine (MB) degree. The MD in that system is a proper medical research doctorate.<p>So this notion that an academician isn&#x27;t a proper or &#x27;real&#x27; doctor is quite bizarre and ahistorical, It&#x27;s also unnecessary to reserve the word to distinguish those in the medical fields, since they already have a number of words that refer exclusively to them, physician, surgeon, etc.",1414973022

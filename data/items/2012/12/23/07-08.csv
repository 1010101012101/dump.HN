Can you give more information about what interests you?  For example, with Kafka, are you reading the shorter stuff, or ""The Trial""?  Do you like it or not?  What are you looking for?<p>By the way, if you find something on there you like, then go give an upvote to ekm2:\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4955541"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4955541</a><p>From that list, I would recommend the following to anybody:\n(Achebe - Things Fall Apart), (Austin - Pride and Prejudice), (Laxness - Independent People), (Marquez - Love in the Time of Cholera), (Gogol - Dead Souls [translation by MacAndrew is the most fun one I've read]), (Twain - Huck Finn).<p>From that list, I would recommend the following only if I knew the person's tastes better:\n(Cervantes - Don Quixote), (Dostoevsky - The Idiot), (Kafka - The Trial), (Orwell - 1984), (Rushdie - Midnight's Children)<p>There are many other books I love that aren't on that list, but whether they would float your boat is anybody's guess.  Personally I would read a shopping list written by Per Olov Enquist, but he seems to be an acquired taste, because nobody else I know digs him as much as I do (and only his ""Royal Physician's Visit"" seems likely to achieve ""classic"" status).<p>If you only know ""The Three Musketeers"" (Dumas) from movies, then you don't know them at all; the book is, for me, central to the idea of reading.  If you liked ""The Three Musketeers"" then you might also like ""Kidnapped"" (Stevenson) and ""Watership Down"" (Adams)-- although probably few would consider that a classic.<p>""Catch-22"" (Heller), ""Mother Night"" and ""Slaughterhouse Five"" (Vonnegut), and ""The Little Prince"" (Exupery) are all ""classic"" books I've read many times over.  I was not a huge fan of ""Les Miserables"" (Hugo) before I read it out loud with my wife about a year ago, and it really grew on me then.  To Orwell's ""1984"" I would add ""Animal Farm"".  ""My Antonia"" (Cather) has something great in it, though many probably would consider it slow.  ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (Lee) deserves a call-out on any list of classics, especially if you're American.  If you like Mark Twain, and want to read something really different by him, then have a look at ""Joan of Arc.""",1356247231

I feel that any idea that has a physical or offline component has a higher barrier to entry and thus has a better chance of succeeding if you get it right, or are even able to provide some incremental benefit compared to existing options. I look at this way - if I don't want to touch something because it's too complicated chances are others feel the same way, and vice-versa.<p>Good luck with whatever you decide to do! :)",1356246473

Sergey Brin didn't slip over the border with a sixth grade education and no ability to speak English.  What we lack is jobs for people on the left half of the bell curve.  There's plenty of room on the right half.",1356246424

The valuation that you invested in is (almost) irrelevant - either you are part of the big successes and have a business as an VC or you didn't participate and don't have a business.<p>That is yet another very counter-intuitive thing about the startup world. In basically every other finance vertical, terms matter greatly. Not so much with VCs. That's why a lot of finance guys make poor VCs, they fundamentally misunderstand the game.",1356246255

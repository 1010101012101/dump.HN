Is it a game or is it just a graphical interface to Wikipedia? The way it is positioned on the site I have no idea, so buying would not be an option for me.<p>Selling to libraries, again is going to be tough, especially with budget constraints. I am much older than today&#x27;s generation, but I can tell you this much, unless that tablet played a game that I could play with my friends, the chances of me running to the library just to browse around on it would have been slim. I also think you may run into some of the same issues as with the individual consumer in that it is not clear to me what it does.<p>Don&#x27;t discount the power of a website to any market. Even if you are having 1-1 conversations, you still want them to leave the meeting and have a chance to go look at something just as informative, or even more informative. It is human nature to not always be paying 100% attention in meetings, so if they get sidetracked for even a second you want a place they can go and see the app. Maybe even have a demo of the app itself on the site.<p>My advice, instead of searching around for a sponsor for a tablet, stand, art supplies, I would find a couple history teachers at schools that utilize tablets. Give the teachers the app and get them to install it with their students. Sell them on this being a pilot program and you are looking for feedback. Teachers are going to be your best advocate. If the app is great, they are going to tell other teachers, which is hopefully going to turn into $$$ for you.",1442516368

Usually the schedule was 4 10s, with the Mondays and Fridays rotating to give a four-day weekend every other week.  Of course, longer days meant overtime pay, too, if it added up to more than 40 hours in the week.  I was also commuting about two hours a day, so shorter days didn&#x27;t really give me any extra free time (downside of government holidays was that they only paid 8 hours, so you&#x27;d end up still working 4 days, just for 8 hours each instead of 10).<p>Working as a programmer now, I find that I mostly can put in about 4 hours of real work in a day, before my brain is mush.  Although there are other blessed days when I get in the groove and have plenty of work to do with no interruptions, and I might work steady for 12 or 15 hours straight.

The difference between liberals (lowercase &#x27;l&#x27;) and conservatives is very little when it comes to the basic premises of how societies should be structured. Very disappointing. The only departure the post makes from this dichotomy is a mention of libertarians and moderates. Something tells me they mean &#x27;right libertarians&#x27; and not libertarian socialists.<p>Heterodox Academy is a striking name for an institution, so I looked up what it&#x27;s supposed to be about and, of course, I found the typical boring premises that infest right wing institutions[1]: Their ideologies haven&#x27;t been rejected because their policies were implemented in real life and produced bad outcomes; clearly it&#x27;s because there is a systematic bias against them. Talk about a persecution complex!<p>As if neoliberalism infesting governments and supranational governing bodies isn&#x27;t enough, it also needs to recapture academia and regain intellectual primacy! The last thing social psychology needs is an infusion of ideas from the end of the spectrum that embraces Murray Rothbard.<p>Last observation before I go: There is a tendency for reactionary movements (and yes! right libertarianism is a reactionary ideology: it dreams of a never borne out vision of laissez-faire capitalism the world abandoned generations ago) to adopt the language and lexicon of those opposed to them. In this case, the adoption of the language of diversity is being used while very likely the people who want the social sciences to be more right wing spit vitriol at the mention of diversity in the broader context of society. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s sincere, and if it is, it&#x27;s laughable.<p>> [Libertarians are the political group with the highest IQ, yet they are underrepresented in the social sciences other than economics]<p>/snicker<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/09/15/heterodox-academy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/201...</a>",1442515518

As a small business founder you are not really in position to do the accounting for it properly and most accountants here have very little idea how to prepare all the documents either.

Nobody had answers for me (I&#x27;ve got different opinions from 2 tax advisors, different one from our tax office and yet different one from national tax information line) and I was just close to giving up altogether (I didn&#x27;t expect my project getting as much traffic as it did and I wasn&#x27;t really in position to spend significant resources for accounting when I didn&#x27;t even know I would make enough to cover it).<p>It&#x27;s a hostile piece of regulation which very severely disincentivize you from starting a business or paying your taxes properly.

10235225,comment,10233947,10233947,0,0,cryoshon,,,"The NYT is mostly out of touch, as usual. A boomer rag-publication of the highest order, the article shows a complete misunderstanding of why house parties aren&#x27;t a thing anymore by confusing some recent fads with socioeconomic problems. House parties aren&#x27;t in decline because people want fancy liquor or fancy food items that hosts don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re competent to cook. The ability to send a text message to cancel an appointment does not cause people to not attend house parties. In small part, being able to stay home with Netflix makes it easier to tolerate being alone, but hardly overrules the desire for social interaction.<p>The real reasons, some of which the NYT glazed over vapidly:<p>1. Money. Specifically, not enough money as a result of bad economic conditions dominating the lifestyle of Millenials, the most likely partyhosters and partygoers. It&#x27;s expensive to buy booze and chips/food for more than a couple people, and a dictum to BYOB guarantees a lot of leeches and a shortage. It&#x27;s pretty passe to charge for entry to your house party as soon as you&#x27;re out of college, so that&#x27;s out. Millenials don&#x27;t have enough cash to be hosting these parties all the time, but probably have enough money to attend them frequently, if it weren&#x27;t for a lack of hosts. The article calls this casual poverty &quot;downsizing&quot;, which offends me riotously-- millenials aren&#x27;t choosing to downsize, they&#x27;re being downsized by extreme income inequality and debt slavery typical in late 
capitalism.<p>2. Space. Millenials live in apartments, in part because they are in desirable areas, but also in part because they can&#x27;t afford to buy homes. Apartments are too small to have good house parties in, so, as the article describes, it&#x27;s &quot;having a few people over&quot; (max 6) at once. I don&#x27;t know anyone with a house or a large apartment here in Boston. Rents are high, and rising. The housing market is still off-limits, so people must rent. The lack of good private space is partially a symptom of a shit economy.<p>3. The cops. Remember in high school when 5-6 of your friends were over quietly watching a movie and the police knocked on the door, incorrectly thinking that there was underaged drinking going on? This happened in my high school suburban community when things were quiet. The fact is, a good party can get loud, and the cops will be prowling around looking to charge someone. A party isn&#x27;t much fun if you are forced to be more inhibited than usual the entire time, anyway. The neighbors being pissed off will probably be the impetus for the cops to show up, but let&#x27;s face it, the mere possibility is going to keep party populations lower.<p>4. Living at home with your parents. This is really just another subset of the money problems with suffocate millenials. You can&#x27;t host a house party in your parents&#x27; house once you&#x27;ve graduated from college. It might also be tougher to attend a party if your parents live far away and the only viable transportation is car. This malaise of living at home is prevalent at about 10% of millenials.",1442514806

Take your cooking website example, say if that recipes has chicken in it. Then the magazine method can show you an ad about local supermarket for you to buy chicken. Then how do they know if you &quot;probably&quot; prefer walmart or wholefoods or local farmer&#x27;s market? What if you are an organic guy? (which means you probably prefer wholefoods) Traditional magazine method doesn&#x27;t make the result relevant enough for today&#x27;s online advertising standard.<p>2) Feedback. As a brand who wanna do an online campaign, how do I know if my advertisement works? Today&#x27;s advertiser no longer count on clicks, they count on impression. They don&#x27;t need you to click to ad. They just want to make sure you see it. How do they if you didn&#x27;t block to ad? How do they know if you didn&#x27;t go to other tabs when their 15 second youtube ad is playing? That means at least 1 additional request send out from your browser. Usually it&#x27;s more because they wanna know if you watched half of the video or the whole video. Things above don&#x27;t have to be done with tracking you profile, but the other things does. For example, how to the advertisers know if they reach their target audience? If I&#x27;m selling the new mustang how do I know if I show the ad to ford people instead of chevy people? It&#x27;s called on target percentage and it&#x27;s one of the top metrics advertisers care about.<p>3) Availability. In many situations, there&#x27;s just no ad available that actually relevant to the content. Then it&#x27;s better for advertisers to show you something that may relevant to you instead of something completely random or no ad at all.<p>Your magazine method has works for decades doesn&#x27;t mean it will continue to work in the future. Does magazine itself still work?<p>BTW, when I raise the WSJ thing I didn&#x27;t target you specifically and I have no idea you had that comment you posted before.

OP didn&#x27;t get offer 70k; he got offered 65k. Maybe that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s better worth or maybe he did a poor job interviewing for that job.<p>Regardless, he got offered 65k and that was his reality. Now instead of owning up to it, he changed it to a nicer sounding number -- 70k. This is where things get interesting. Why not 75k? What&#x27;s the harm if you&#x27;re lying anyway? Perhap he didn&#x27;t think it would be believable because he didn&#x27;t think he was worth that much. If the employer actually checked his facts, they would have known he was lying and got annoyed. Yet it&#x27;s fascinating to me that he went for 70k -- a mere 5k more.<p>OP - I went from making ~100k/yr to 175k/yr because I knew I had the power in the relationship and was probably not tricked by same things you were. I built value in myself and in the work I was doing, and therefore when it came time to negotiate, I shot for the stars and never backed down. I sound about your same age and never had to do it by lying or equivocating or any of these silly games. I did it by building value in myself. This is all you can truly do at the end of the day and then it&#x27;s about staying firm in what your value is worth. Games will always be games and they are sprinkled with the fairy dust of &quot;5k more&quot; here and another small lie there, but they will never be able to match someone who is truly genuine through and through. These are the types where if they&#x27;re not worth 70k, they work to make themselves worth 70k (whether thru negotiation or value-building or both).

For example, there is an amazing amount of Stack Overflow answers and folks watching for new questions.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that Express, the most popular Node framework, is a clone of Ruby&#x27;s Sinatra, not of Rails. That&#x27;s a great back-end when your front-end is iOS or React and you have a relatively simple data model. But it&#x27;s not as strong a solution if you need to do server-rendered pages (which we need to support IE8).<p>The bigger issue is that Rails is just a much more mature and full-featured framework than Express or Sails.js (which is designed to be Rails for Node). From migrations to validations to strong parameters to many other areas, Rails just offers a ton of back-end functionality that is not as mature on Node frameworks. The big question is how much back-end business logic needs to be implemented.<p>I haven&#x27;t run into any issues with Ruby&#x27;s server performance. AWS instances are easy to spin up, and any Ruby compute time is almost certainly going to be overwhelmed by network and database access. The performance we&#x27;re focused on is developer productivity, and I think Ruby retains an advantage there over Javascript (though obviously we use both). If I were trying to support millions of simultaneous web socket connections, I would almost certainly go with Node (or maybe Go).",1442514049

The author seems to try to distinguish between the two by saying there are things we might be able to know, and things we will never be able to know. Being a layman and not studied in philosophy and logic, it seems to me that indeterminacy is enough to encapsulate ineffability. This is illustrated by the numerous examples the author gives on attempts to explain the ineffable: this immediately makes it indeterminate, going by the author&#x27;s use of logic. The author then goes on to talk about ordinal numbers, and presents what is purported to be an ineffable phrase:<p>the least ordinal that cannot be referred to<p>There are more ordinals than ordinary language can refer to, and one of these must be the least. But, by using that phrase we are referring to it. This is an obvious contradiction, but we know there must be one such ordinal.  The author uses this to say that since we cannot talk about it, but it exists, it is ineffable. I say that this is unnecessary, it is enough to say the ordinal is indeterminate precisely because we cannot refer to it (determine it).<p>That it took us until the 20th century to imagine these ideas in mathematics and logic doesn&#x27;t speak to any shortcomings of western logic with regards to contradiction and indeterminacy, in my opinion. It merely reflects the priorities of eastern and western thought. This is illustrated by the efforts of Bertrand Russell with his Principia. Through the centuries, western thinkers had made advances by considering what is true and what is false, and taking contradictions as dead ends that do not produce interesting areas of study. Russell tried to take this as far as he could with Principia, and in doing so inadvertently revealed the limitations of how far we can advance, limitations that were detailed by Kurt Godel and his incompleteness theorems. I say that, since we have advanced so far as to know the limits, now we are having more to say about contradiction and indeterminacy, and we are now saying it in a more precise way than Buddhist philosophers imagined in their day.",1442513673

I thought the point was to temporarily ignore more difficult parts of ASM to make learning incremental and easier. And then be able to do same as real assembly coder later w/ ability to make tradeoffs between raw performance, productivity, and easy-to-read code. Overall, a great tool in theory.<p>Also, gave me ideas on how to bootstrap a subversion-resistant system. You start with assembler, build a HLA-like tool from that, easily build a 3GL + straight-to-HLA compiler with that, and then use that to build rest (including optimizations). My concept was inspired by Wirth and Jurg&#x27;s bitslice -> M-code ASM -> Modula 2 -> OS work in Lilith project. Alternatively, you can go MenuetOS or KolibriOS w/ HLA for above benefits. Use full HLA for rapid addition/testing of new features with raw ASM for optimizing the fast paths. Thoughts on either?",1442513166

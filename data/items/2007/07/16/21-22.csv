Not me.  This article is an excellent, level-headed summary.<p>-Matt",1184622579

34598,comment,34461,34461,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I've noticed there is a negative bias towards the ""enterprise"" languages by many on this forum. Not calling out gregwebs in particular, just speaking generally. <p>I think much of the negativism stems from the hacker mentality that big companies are evil and that breaking the rules is cool. Therefore anything that big companies do or use is automatically uncool.<p>Nothing wrong with this mindset, but I think it often goes too far with some. Java and C++ are not bad languages. Yes, most large software companies use them but there are some reasons why they might be a desirable choice. One is that these languages work well in a collaborative work environment. There are many proven debugging tools, established QA practices, very good IDEs with integrated revision synchronization tools, etc. While these may not matter for the hacker or small group of hackers creating something cool, they are very important considerations for a growing software company who has plans to scale.<p>So with this understanding in mind I wouldn't automatically rule out a company based on the fact they code in C++/Java. Ask them why do and you might discover that there's more there than what meets the eye.",1184621521

Will using WSGR or Goodwin Procter set us back an arm and a leg, or are most competent firms roughly equivalent in price?  Is legal stuff a place where it's even worth being price-sensitive, or does it pay to splurge for a top-tier law firm?",1184620654

34588,comment,34461,34568,0,0,aston,,,"You're collapsing stuff down in an interesting way that makes these marginal languages look more important than they probably are. If you were to do it by lines of codes, organizational importance, financial pay off, number of engineers working in a language, or pretty much any metric other than ""does ___ use ___ somewhere in their codebase?,"" I think you'll find that Java and C++ are huge.<p>That said, sure, folks use other languages, too. Yahoo and Facebook are particularly good examples of companies that have more than the typical share of a non-Java/non-C++ language for their apps. And even they use C++ (and maybe Java) elsewhere.",1184620085

I don't really miss it all that much - OK, Rhythmbox does not have Coverflow (yet), but apart from that, it seems to do roughly the same thing.<p>I don't want to compare Apple apps to Linux apps, just point out that many Apple apps come with a nasty aftertaste. Maybe most apps on your list are clean, maybe not. It's all about trust to begin with, and I don't really trust Apple to do the right thing.",1200904261

So I just evaluated the sum at four data-points (n=0,1,2,3) and used those to determine the four coefficents by solving a linear equation system.",1200904161

That's a _lot_ for a rails app.  In fact, looking around, I'd be surprised if there were any existing rails applications that serve that many.  43things.com seems to max out in the 50K users per day range (on average).  The first question I have to ask is do you really need to handle that kind of traffic?  If you don't - don't bother trying to scale to that much yet.  If you're talking hits, that's a different story... You'll definitely want to know how many concurrent you're getting.  For reference, a TechCrunch post generates between 20-50 concurrent hits on an application that renders in ~1s/page (as of Nov 07).  Plan for 2x-3x that for digg/reddit traffic.\nThat TechCrunch load was served with 4 or 5 mongrels.  6-8 is the most I'd recommend running on a dual-core box.<p>I haven't seen a 1000 concurrent user app since I worked at UPS... so if you have this problem, why are you asking us?  You should be hiring someone with the huge amount of money you have. ;)",1200904087

I went to a presentation by a recruiter (for graphic design) who echoed the fact that if you don't have a viable LinkedIn presence - you're not really a candidate. Blogging about personal & software development and learning Wordpress are high on my choose-to-do short list for 2008.",1200903233

A dollar is worth something to me because I can ultimately exchange it for goods or services produced in the United States. If this were not possible, for instance if the USA completely closed their borders to all foreign trade and travel, then the dollar would be worthless to anyone outside the country.<p>You mention that a cheque needs time for the money to be transferred. So you give me a cheque for $1, I would have to wait for the dollar to be transferred from your bank account to mine. But what if I didn't cash the cheque? What if I gave that cheque to someone else as a substitute for a dollar bill? If Alice gives a cheque to Bob, then Bob can pay Carol with that cheque if Carol trusts Alice is good for the debt.<p>Finally, regarding the dollar being accepted for paying my government duties, that's only true for countries that have the US dollar as their official currency. If the USA disappeared tomorrow, the dollars I own would be worthless; they only have worth because they're backed by the USA, much has a cheque only has worth while a particular bank account exists and has funds.",1360061950

If I've misunderstood bit-rot, by now some of my colleagues would have .. corrected .. me.  ;)<p>Code Coverage means that you have demonstrated, beyond a doubt, that every single path in your code has been tested as functional and per-spec.<p>An if statement requires (minimally) two things to happen (sometimes three, depending on the compiler/architecture):  a compare of some values, then a branch.  A goto requires one thing: jump.<p>This then, reduces the cyclomatic complexity of your code path, and for coverage purposes is ideal because you're testing a simple jump, not a load, compare, branch.  The use of if, in the example given, makes the testing complexity a lot higher - what if the if is broken somehow?

In South Africa, Telkom, the state monopoly had its monopoly status extended in return for rolling out services to rural areas. What really happened was that cellphones rapidly overtook landlines, and the common perception is that most of the landlines have been stolen and used for copper (although that isn't entirely true, I think, our maid has a cheap line in a rural area). Telkom's monopoly has expired, and it is crumbling, but South African telecoms were set back significantly.<p>South Africa's telecoms law was written with much input from SBC, an American corporation that bought a stake in Telkom ( <a href=""http://twentythirdfloor.co.za/2007/08/27/telkom-sbc-and-a-few-things-suddenly-making-sense/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twentythirdfloor.co.za/2007/08/27/telkom-sbc-and-a-fe...</a> ).<p>Although most think that there was a purely ulterior motive in granting the monopoly, your comment makes me wonder if they were trying to replicate the de facto American model.",1360060669

Like it or not, but we still have to ensure that the bit that is 1 is a 1 and not a 0, in this day and age - especially for safety-critical/life-dependent systems.  The goto gives both full coverage capabilities (good for testing/certification) as well as providing one less path for radiation to be rotting bits.<p>(And before we get into the NAND/ECC discussion, remember: this is for <i>software</i> certification requirements.. it doesn't matter how hard your hardware is, what matters is how hard your software is ..)",1360060059

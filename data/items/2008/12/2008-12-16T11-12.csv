This was very helpful in:<p>(a) Working bugs out of the system<p>(b) Giving us an idea about what features people would actually used (and how)<p>(c) Allowing us to see what keywords converted best (useful in helping to drive future marketing)",1229427415

This is a textbook case for regulation. A similar case is car insurance : your (irrational) choice is to not buy it.

7128898,comment,7126745,7127550,2,0,goostavos,,,"(Firstly, holy moly, something I wrote is on the front page of Hacker News!? I couldn&#x27;t figure out why I was suddenly getting twitter messages on my otherwise dormant account.)<p>Yeah, the requirement that things be picklable in order to send to another process is one of the worst parts of Python in my opinion. I can write the bulk of my code without running into the limitation, but when I do hit it? Holy crap. Rage.<p>The only work around I&#x27;ve found, which isn&#x27;t really a work around at all, is throwing out the idea of small, side effect free functions. By which I mean, give the process everything it needs to get the resources on &quot;its&quot; side (thus avoiding the pickling), and then let it process stuff until it&#x27;s gotten back to some serializable base object that it can finally return. Not ideal, but that&#x27;s how I generally work around it.<p>There&#x27;s also `multiprocessing.Array` and `Value` which avoid the pickle requirement completely, as they&#x27;re shared memory, but limit you to very base datatypes. Really only good if your operating on some homogeneous array (which for me isn&#x27;t too often).",1390798777

There&#x27;s 1 year of leave, so that&#x27;s 50,000, no?<p>I get 50,000/4,500,000 => 1.1% . Still relatively small, yes.<p>I noticed a few things about the [1] you mentioned.

We know, for example, that for every kilometre ridden by bike, the Danish coffers recieve 23 cents. For every kilometre driven by car, the Danish state pays out 16 cents.<p>I&#x27;ve read through the GDP many times before. I still don&#x27;t have a good grasp on it. It seems that having a poorly insulated house, for example, is better for the GDP because I need to work more in order to pay the higher heating bills. Or having more road damage because of automotive traffic is better because it means more government funding to rebuild the road system. Or it&#x27;s better to use MS Windows than OpenBSD because the latter doesn&#x27;t cost anything and so doesn&#x27;t appear as part of the GDP.<p>These are listed as &#x27;externalities&#x27;, but it&#x27;s these externalities which contribute to happiness, enjoyment of life, etc. So while GDP per capita is used as an approximate measure for the ability to carry these out, it doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s actually being done.",1390797663

This is false and unreasonable. Companies try to minimize their costs, including wages.<p>Now if in some industry, some company is making huge profit margins, and paying low wages, what is the cause, and what is the solution? In economics, profits go down until they reach 0 or close to 0. Why? because if there are huge profit margins, more firms come in, to compete. Therefore in all industries, profits go down to a lower level.<p>Now why doesn&#x27;t this happen in practice? The answer is artificial barriers to entry. Political agreements and regulations benefiting the big companies. So what is needed here is an easier path for new companies (Which are people after all). This will always ensure that profit margins stay low, and wages approach the true market rate.<p>The solution is not donation. Why would a company pay 9 dollars to a worker who is willing to work for 8? Why aren&#x27;t YOU donating money to poor people in Africa? The answer is not minimum wage either. This distorts markets.

Such thinking is wrong.<p>I agree that there may be some cause that makes profits go higher and wages go lower, or they could be totally unrelated.  But the driver of wages is competition for hiring people.  It&#x27;s no surprise that in a time of relatively higher employment, there has been little or no wages growth.  What is surprising is that corporate profits have expanded.  But then, if you have a monetary regime where printing money (QE) is designed to re-inflate the capital of financial institutions via devaluing the currency, then it&#x27;s not surprising that profits go up for those with first bite at the new-money.<p>Is that the cause?

If you&#x27;re writing a CRUD application this covers a lot of the basics. There&#x27;s also <a href=""https://github.com/eaigner/jet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/eaigner/jet</a> which is a &#x27;micro ORM&#x27; (and very light on the ORM part).<p>> &quot;html/template&quot; doesn&#x27;t support things like inheritance, didn&#x27;t even support comparison operators until Go 1.2, etc.<p>I grew to like html/template over time, but the lack of comparison operators pre Go 1.2 was a huge sore point and I had I been working on this little project a year ago I&#x27;d have been extremely frustrated. The lack of inheritance was a bit of a pain for me too—I ended up splitting my templates into many (!) smaller pieces so I could at least re-use the portions I needed to. Hopefully something &quot;Jinja-esque&quot; comes in time.<p>There&#x27;s an (unmaintained) Mustache port and a Mustache-alike in Mandira (<a href=""https://github.com/jmoiron/mandira"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jmoiron/mandira</a>) but I&#x27;ve not seen anything like Jinja yet. If there&#x27;s one thing html/template has going for it is that I can trust it (as much as one can) to be &#x27;safe&#x27;.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say web apps in Go should be avoided at all costs, but I would say that you should consider the scope/scale and do a bit of research first. Sometimes Django/Rails or Flask/Sinatra might make it easier on you.",1390797402

Those assumptions result in worker benefits being tied to employers. They&#x27;re why the government can get away with hiding half the tax rate of the payroll tax from workers behind the &quot;employer contribution&quot;. They&#x27;re partly why savings rates have fallen so badly over the past few decades. And so on. A lot of which is ultimately to the detriment of the individual worker. If workers were more independent and more mobile, able to self-employ more easily, and so on then they&#x27;d tend to have much higher wages on average, I&#x27;d wager. The current system doesn&#x27;t reward independence, it punishes it, but independence is precisely how workers gain an upper hand once they&#x27;ve built up a considerable amount of experience.",1390796169

The flavor can&#x27;t be counterfeited at all, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter what&#x27;s on the label, what country it comes from, etc. -- olive oil is all so different, it can really only be bought by taste alone. You might have 5 different olive oils in your cupboard depending on what you&#x27;re using them for, but you didn&#x27;t buy <i>any</i> of them based on their label!<p>There&#x27;s plenty of olive oil labeled extra-virgin that tastes like nothing. Is it really extra-virgin? Maybe it is, maybe it isn&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t matter, the only thing that matters is that it doesn&#x27;t taste like anything. If you&#x27;re looking for an oil that doesn&#x27;t have any taste (which there are many uses for), and it&#x27;s cheap, go ahead and buy it.

I think that technology will keep improving hybrid powertrains, but we won&#x27;t likely see an electric car for the masses for one or two decades more. Due to the amount of politics that surround petroleum.<p>Now, what would like to see get more R&D is biofuel from a simple to produce source (like algae). Couple a small engine running biofuel to a generator and put a nice 200HP electric motor to the backwheels and we will have a nice every day appliance on wheels (what most people need/want).<p>What will keep happening is the reduction in complexity of the 4-stroke engine. We removed the hydraulic power steering pump in favor of an electric one, then comes the A/C compressor driven by an electric motor (some use it already). A bit later we will get an electric water pump. And then we will forgo camshafts and all related parts in exchange for electric actuators. Which will turn the intake manifold into a sort of thing in the past. Imagine having a 12-cylinder engine that&#x27;s smaller than a 4 cylinder, but makes 3 times the power with the same efficiency.

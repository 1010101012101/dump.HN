Some fringe commentators try to make something out of the risk of transporting a range of materials (from contaminated soil to reprocessed fuel rods) through a jurisdiction that suffers an uncommon level of collisions and derailments, has minimal emergency service capacity and is the epicentre of the single greatest earthquake event in the southern hemisphere - but these concerns are effortlessly overrun by the brute application of raw political power.

4420048,comment,4412804,4413587,1,0,lotharbot,,,"The main factor that makes me think this is fiction is the math.<p>A 350x350 world seems pretty small, but that's over 120,000 blocks per layer, or over 15 million total blocks within the barrier (including empty/air blocks).  Using stats from some of my other worlds, I'd expect a world of that size to have about 6 million stone blocks, maybe 750 thousand dirt, and 75,000 grass.<p>And two players out of 30 supposedly managed to mine/destroy basically all 75,000 grass blocks in the level without others realizing it and fortifying relatively large safe zones?  Those who banded together around tiny protected grass patches didn't manage to surround them with more dirt, thereby allowing them to grow?<p>There was supposedly a lot of strip mining, so where are the giant cobble structures?  ""Oh, it all fell in the lava"" -- how does every single player manage to drop thousands of blocks of cobble in the lava, exactly?<p>Thinking about other resources leads to similarly absurd conclusions.  I'd estimate 1,500+ diamond ore in that area, or about 50 per player.  That's enough to make 16-17 diamond picks per player, which is enough to mine about 25,000 blocks.  Yet it's claimed diamond was used ""only for obsidian"" -- so where are the giant obsidian structures that took multiple players multiple diamond picks to create?<p>Similarly for iron, gravel, and all the other resources -- what did 30 players do with it all in only a couple of months?<p>Whoever wrote this little piece of fiction simply didn't realize how much <i>stuff</i> there is in a MineCraft world that size.  Anybody actually playing in a situation like this, even with a couple of griefers, would find they were able to manage just fine.  It doesn't take all that much to build a self-sustaining secret base, and once one is running, it's not that hard to build another and another and another.  The amount of resources available in a 350x350 space are way more than 30 players could use, or destroy, in 2 months of playing.",1345675714
4420047,comment,4418515,4419948,7,0,DennisP,,,"Argonne National Laboratory tested a cohabited breeder called the Integral Fast Reactor. The reprocessing would happen on-site, using a process similar to electrolysis which never separates plutonium from the other transuranics. The material would never be in a form usable for bombs, and making it bomb-ready would be more difficult than just enriching uranium. But the fast neutrons in the reactor would easily burn up those transuranics.<p>What's more, they had very good passive safety. Fukushima had problems because it lost external power. Argonne shut off the power to their test reactor, and it just quietly shut down with no damage, simply due to the physics of the fuel and coolant.<p>They had it just shy of production ready when Clinton shut it down in 1994. But GE-Hitachi has a design derived from it, called the PRISM. The NRC has approved it for a demonstration reactor, and they're currently trying to sell it to the U.K. to destroy their plutonium stockpile.<p>Since the reactor can use U238, it's about a hundred times as efficient with uranium.

The reason (IMHO) is that the Internets since 1992 or so have been an antisocial network, and anything worth attacking that lacks a centralized defense command is rapidly overrun by digital Huns.  For instance, SMTP exists today because it existed before eternal September, and being valuable was (barely) defended; but if it didn't exist as a legacy from the old, social Internet, it would be very difficult to create it in the new antisocial one.  If not impossible.<p>I mean, it's certainly not that some of us rotting old neckbeards weren't using finger and talk on the firewall-free Internet in 1989.

The Colorado River and Owens Valley are particularly noteworthy.  The movie ""Chinatown"" and the book * Cadillac Desert* describe some of this story in detail.  In other parts of the world, water is an international concern:  Israel and Jordon, Egypt and Sudan (over the Nile), the Danube in Europe, various wathersheds shared by India, China, and Pakistan.

Much of the Sahara and other middle eastern deserts contain significant aquifers (the region was a lush savannah 10,000 years ago), though the water contained has been there for thousands of years.<p>Ocean reserves are not fresh water.<p>Making seawater potable is extremely expensive (energy or dollars).  Desalination costs roughly $0.50 per 1000 liters (264 gallons).  This is equivalent to the cost of transporting fresh water 2000 meters vertically (6,600 ft) or 1600km (1000 miles).",1345675141

4419868,comment,4418515,4419073,6,0,adimitrov,,,"> Besides, it may be nitpicking, but kids eating dirt right outside power plants would die horrible deaths within days. It is the lesser doses in the rear by populated areas whose effects may not be so well understood.<p>Nah, it's not nitpicking. It's just totally wrong.<p>The radiation that upon ingestion kills you is alpha/beta radiation, i.e. particle radiation. This radiation doesn't otherwise cause harm (except in very large doses,) because it's a particle radiation that can't penetrate solid matter.<p>Nuclear reactors handle their fuel carefully (well, that's the default assumption. I don't know if all do,) and so, only gamma-radiation actually escapes the power plant, except in emergencies, of course. Gamma-radiation permeates through solid matter without too much difficulty (well, depending on the (amount of) matter, but the human body is basically translucent to gamma radiation. This is why X-Rays actually work.) and therefore it really doesn't matter whether the kids do ingest it or not.<p>Now, <i>coal power plants</i> on the other hand are an entirely different thing. Fly Ash, which coal power plants exude in large quantities contains Thorium and Uranium in rather high concentrations. Ingesting <i>that</i> might indeed be hazardous, though I don't know if you'd die a ""horrible death"" from the amounts typically in the vicinity (around 1 mile or so) of coal power plants.<p>Fun fact: coal power plants actually cause more radiation pollution to their surroundings than nuclear power plants (during normal operation.)<p>EDIT: I was wrong, nuclear power plants also emit alpha and beta radiation, as well as gamma, neutron, neutrino and positron radiation and other stuff. But apparently in such small quantities that I really can't imagine anyone dying from eating the soil around a nuclear power plant. Proof: this is a German AKW (Atomkraftwerk, nuclear power plant) in Phillipsburg. Notice how it is entirely surrounded with fields where crops is grown? People and animals eat all this stuff. <a href=""http://goo.gl/maps/jydz1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/maps/jydz1</a> Actually, Biblis (another AKW) is even more impressive: <a href=""http://goo.gl/maps/LP1Hi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/maps/LP1Hi</a>",1345673130

It's much easier to fund the kind of welfare state that the left wants when we have a high reproductive rate.  The dreams of the right,  in which many of us can save money in individual accounts and enjoy an easy retirement,  are also dashed by a low reproductive rate.<p>Honestly I don't know what the optimal reproductive rate is.

Once you do, then it is your duty to ensure that those `unsafe` blocks don&#x27;t cause memory unsafety, regardless of what the rest of your program does. Following from that, if the correctness of your `unsafe` block relies on invariants in your data, then it is your duty to keep your data private so that those invariants cannot be broken by consumers (or alternatively, provide safe accessor functions that allow consumers to fiddle with things while performing runtime checks to ensure invariants are upheld).",1452534703

Even if they&#x27;ve collected it, Google does not own information about the road system; facts themselves, like &quot;Road A exists at lat X and long Z&quot;, cannot be copyrighted.<p>See <i>Feist v. Rural Telephone</i> for more on this. The only reason application of <i>Feist</i> is generally limited in cases of online access is because we have a theory that accessing a publicly available database containing phone numbers is akin to accessing someone else&#x27;s private property, and therefore they can dictate whatever they want under theories like trespass to chattels, whereas consulting a printed telephone book in your home is decidely not accessing the phone company&#x27;s property.<p>This is a pernicious, subtle issue now that we&#x27;re becoming so dependent on online access provided by someone else&#x27;s servers instead of accessing printed documents that we possess in our homes. Possession is 9/10 of the law, as they say. We need to rethink how &quot;possession&quot; applies to digital resources.<p>Likewise, there are laws around how much access a private property owner must grant to members of the public, especially if that property owner is running a business that is generally accessible to the public. Private property owners are allowed to declare some people trespassers, but each jurisdiction has different laws surrounding what the public can do on private property and when a trespass is allowable. For example, California&#x27;s state constitution guarantees the right to hold reasonable protests in private shopping centers that are generally accessible to the public, whether the property owner likes it or not.<p>No one is saying there is a requirement for another business &quot;to help invest&quot; in any other; there may be requirements not to interfere with someone else&#x27;s business by attempting to block what is otherwise public and freely available access to non-copyrightable information.<p>IANAL.<p>Routebuilder is fortunate that OpenStreetMap has collected much of the same data and that they can just code against a different API and continue to operate.",1452534148

But I&#x27;m extremely skeptical about the resistance claim. First off, what evidence do we have that this cure was ever widely used in Anglo-Saxon times? We&#x27;d require not just its presence in Bald&#x27;s Leechbook but the 9th century equivalent of actual treatment records, or some kind of material/archeological evidence like remains of this specific cure in drug jars (which so far as I know don&#x27;t exist). Second, Anglo-Saxon England was basically a backwater in terms of the total human population of the time and was not particularly well integrated into larger global networks. If the cure was present in a Tang Chinese text or even something from northern Italy or the Byzantine Empire, it would be more convincing that it would have had far-reaching epidemiological effects, but with the existing evidence I think it&#x27;s a huge leap to assume that it actually was used to treat enough people successfully that it resulted in widespread resistance.<p>Anyway, I still really enjoyed the Radiolab piece about this (I love that they met at a Viking re-enactment!) but I think the implications of this have been really distorted in the popular press. We&#x27;d need to know an order of magnitude more about the global disease environment in Late Antiquity to actually make any guesses about the impact of this cure at the time it was set down.",1452533791

And good code should be objectively good so it doesn&#x27;t matter who writes it. You&#x27;ll impart maximum value to your team once you learn how to cooperate.

Critical thought should not change from person to person.

So car manufacturers started improving their designs to score better in these tests. The whole &quot;top safety pick&quot; thing is an IIHS rating.<p>- From 2009 the NHTSA required a greater roof-crush load (3x the vehicle&#x27;s weight, from 1.5x).<p>- Safety Cell improvements: Crumple zones are less likely to trap in the driver or front passenger&#x27;s legs/feet during impact.<p>- Anti-intrusion bars: Are more standard. The IIHS tests kind of pushed them into mainstream.<p>- Additional air bags (side impact).<p>- Whiplash reduction seats and headrests.<p>Overall regulations aren&#x27;t why cars are safer in 2016, consumer demand is.

There&#x27;s no &quot;universal music&quot;, just music who&#x27;s rules you are familiar with. Tweak those rules just enough and in the right way and you are innovative (see: The Beatles). Tweak them too much and you are simply avant garde (see: Captain Beefheart).<p>That means that music is without question a social construction. Simply look at how non-western music is so radically different from popular western music, yet still appealing within those cultures.<p>It&#x27;s very possible Bowie could have been too avant garde or too much of an outsider, but what he excelled at was tweaking the establishment <i>just enough</i> (both musically and performance-wise) to find a huge audience whilst still being &quot;outside&quot; the mainstream.",1452531980

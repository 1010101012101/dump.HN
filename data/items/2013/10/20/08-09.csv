6579296,comment,6577345,6578586,1,0,Dewie,,,"> You assert that exercising and changing your diet have the same end result when they clearly do not, unless you are using &quot;healthy&quot; as a euphemism for &quot;lose weight&quot; or something similar. Do you have a factual basis for asserting that changing your diet and exercising result in the same end results?<p>I have NEVER said anything remotely similar to that. My argument has been that <i>assuming</i> (I&#x27;ve always said <i>assuming</i> or some variation; it&#x27;s a premise, not an assertion) that low-carb is superior to some other method, like a more generic diet, AND it is easier to follow, you should do that. Nowhere have I said ANYTHING about exercising and dieting being the same. The argument is more general; given that doing some thing (ANY thing, exercising, standing on one foot, low-carb, etc.) is easier AND yields better results compared to another thing (AGAIN, any one thing; standing on one foot, exercising, etc.), you should do the former.<p>My argument does not rely on low-carb actually being better than something (anything) else; that was simply the premise.<p>> Thank you for clarifying that you do not find exercise enjoyable, I was curious if that was the case. I find exercise to be rewarding in it&#x27;s own right - it&#x27;s unfortunate that you don&#x27;t experience it the same way.<p>Thank you for for repeatedly misrepresenting, or even inventing, what I&#x27;ve said. I wonder what leads you to jump to these specific conclusions; is it the fact that I&#x27;ve been writing about &#x27;challenging&#x27; things, or &#x27;no pain no gain&#x27;? Well, exercise is not solely the domain of &#x27;challenging&#x27;; a diet can be challenging. That was what was after all what was discussed originally, namely the fact that a person scoffed at using a specific, claimed to be easier and better diet, over another diet. Nothing about exercise, or that it replaces it. &quot;No pain no gain&quot;? I&#x27;d venture to say that people that are one something like &quot;one apple for breakfast, one banana for dinner and that&#x27;s it&quot; are probably going to feel some <i>pain</i> while on this diet, certainly compared to someone that is on a diet actually lets them eat enough food to become somewhat sated. Exercise can be painful, but not necessarily. Nowhere have I ever said that all exercise is just painful.<p>My sentence about &quot;jumping on one leg to work&quot; has nothing to do with exercise in general. It is just a silly everyday limitation. I might like to play rugby instead, because that is a sport that I enjoy.<p>As for if I find exercise enjoyable or not: it depends. Lifting weights can be &#x27;enjoyable in its own right&#x27;, i.e. simply the act of doing it. On the other hand, something like high intensity interval training is often downright miserable. In fact, let me for a moment take a page out of the exercise masochists and say; if you are enjoying exercising, you are simply not exercising hard enough! Which leads me to the last point:<p>> &quot;No pain, no gain&quot; can be interpreted as saying that sometimes it is worth enduring discomfort or pain in the short term for a longer term reward. It&#x27;s more a comment on dealing with delayed gratification than a description of whether an activity is enjoyable or worth doing.<p>...and it can be eventually be taken so far as to become and end in itself rather than something that serves a higher purpose. There are plenty of fitness-geeks that use how much pain they are in to gauge how well they are doing, but that is certainly not always the best strategy. You can bench press a weight until you are so exhausted that you could hardly lift anything, but you might be better off <i>not</i> lifting until failure if your main goal is to increase strength and stress your nervous system, over building muscle.",1382257952

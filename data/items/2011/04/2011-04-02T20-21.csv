Most people think of Three Mile Island or maybe Nevada Test Site as examples of the worst nuclear accidents in US history but I had no idea:<p>>The Hot Lab suffered a number of fires involving radioactive materials. For example, in 1957, a fire in the Hot Cell ""got out of control and ... massive contamination"" resulted. In July, 1959, the site suffered a partial nuclear meltdown that has been named ""the worst in U.S. history"", releasing an undisclosed amount of radiation, but thought to be much more than the Three Mile Island disaster in 1979.<p>> At least four of the ten nuclear reactors suffered accidents. The AE6 reactor experienced a release of fission gases in March 1959, the SRE experienced a power excursion and partial meltdown in July 1959; the SNAP8ER in 1964 experienced damage to 80% of its fuel; and the SNAP8DR in 1969 experienced similar damage to one-third of its fuel.<p>> The reactors located on the grounds of SSFL were considered experimental, and therefore had no containment structures.<p>> Throughout the years, approximately ten low-power nuclear reactors operated at SSFL, in addition to several ""critical facilities"": a sodium burn pit in which sodium-coated objects were burned in an open pit; a plutonium fuel fabrication facility; a uranium carbide fuel fabrication facility; and the purportedly largest ""Hot Lab"" facility in the United States at the time.",1301777845

The biggest help I've found was:<p>Break down your productive tasks into smaller ones that can be accomplished in an hour or two of concentrated work.<p>The big reason I procrastinate is because my real projects seem unmanageable.  They're big, or they're scary, or they'll just take too much time to be worth investing in now.  The solution to that is to make them smaller, less scary, and easily completed with the time you have now.  That means doing more of them, but at least you'll be able to make forward progress.<p>I took on a 20% project at work with the express goal of teaching myself how to break down a large, self-motivated project into one that I can actually motivate myself to complete.  It's a library that'll probably be 10-15k lines of code when completed, based on similar projects.  Most commits are no larger than 200 lines of code.

2400898,comment,2400025,2400025,40,0,cletus,,,"I'm a little disappointed that Fred has fallen into the seductive trap of comparing Android and iOS to Windows and Mac. It's superficially attractive but doesn't stand up to any serious scrutiny.<p>What's winning here isn't <i>openness</i> (which has many, many definitions), it's <i>commoditization</i>. Android is successfully commoditizing the smartphone market, which is good for Google, good for consumers and bad for the carriers and handset makers (who are willing accessories in their race to the bottom).<p>A better analogy (IMHO) is, in gaming terms, PCs (Android) vs consoles (iOS).<p>PCs are more powerful than consoles (except for a short window when the console is released). This of course depends on what (if any) graphics card the PC has. PCs (despite Windows) are essentially ""open"". You can install what applications, devices, drivers, etc you want. Technically you can replace Windows with something like Linux too (but that won't do your gaming any favours).<p>Consoles are essentially a closed system. The device is protected from modification (to some degree). Publishing games requires meeting hefty requirements laid out by the console maker (and license fees).<p>The benefit of the console model is clear: consumer don't need to mess around with them. They just turn them on and they work. Gaming publishers can develop to a much wider audience with a fixed hardware platform.<p>We've now reached a point where 3D graphics have basically gotten as good as they need to for the vast majority of consumers. It's a bit like the move from video to DVD was huge (in terms of quality). DVD to Blu-ray? The majority of consumers still don't care (and probably never will).<p>Better graphics engine in games basically translates into higher art/content costs and that is a case of diminishing returns.<p>So consoles are basically killing off PC gaming (except for a few niche genres)--and here's the key point--because <i>the hardware is as good as it needs to be</i>.<p>None of this was true in the Windows vs Mac era. The rapid development of Windows-based PCs, both in terms of raw power and price-performance, is really what killed the Mac.<p>That power is now of far diminished importance. In the mobile market, in some ways, more power is less desirable because it comes at a cost in battery life, size and weight (none of which were ever relevant to the Windows vs Mac debate, other than for laptops). Now shrinking transistors does lead to increases in power but that is fairly predictable and uniform across all platforms.<p>Consumers, give enough power, start valuing other things like the UI, the design of the device, the ecosystem, the brand and so on (basically this is a ""need"" to ""want"" transition).<p>In all of these areas Apple has a <i>huge</i> lead.<p>But Apple only produces one handset at the very top of the market. Android wins total market share in smartphones for two primary reasons:<p>1. Most people just use their phones as phones (diminishing the value of the ecosystem); and<p>2. Android competes in a lot of markets the iPhone doesn't.<p>So I concede that Android seems likely to dominate the phone market at this point. <i>I just don't think it's terribly relevant to the future of mobile computing.</i><p>The future (IMHO) is about tablets, a market where Apple has an enormous lead and huge advantages, one where the halo effect is likely to benefit everything else they produce.",1301776868

Encounter something unpleasant that needs to get done? Switch and work on the other project. I've done this in the past and the results are (a) everything moves slower, (b) I have less motivation to tackle the stuff I want to put off, and (c) there is a very high switching cost (in terms of time) that I pay.<p>Multiple projects are good (and critical for me personally) but they definitely come at a cost.

Again, even showing P = NP does not guarantee to provide a fast algorithm for ""hard instances"" in NP.  Net. the question P versus NP is a bit far from practice.<p>Again, a big example is the simplex algorithm:  In practice, the algorithm finds optimal solutions in about 3m iterations where m is the number of rows, and we get to forget about the number of columns.  So in practice simplex is terrific as a 'polynomial' algorithm:  It's faster than a degree 1 polynomial since we get to ignore the number of columns.  But, simplex, worst case, is exponential.  So, there are polynomial algorithms to replace simplex, but they are all far too slow:  If simplex takes too long, then the polynomial algorithms take still longer.<p>Linear programming is one of the best examples we have for where we had an exponential algorithm and found a polynomial one.  The result: The polynomial algorithm sucked.<p>You wrote:<p>""find the minimal size circuit that explains this big set of observations"".<p>I tried to skip over that part of the paper to keep my response simple.<p>First it is not clear what he means by ""explains"", but I fear that I do know.  Basically he wants a 'fit', but this is dangerous.  In practice, a good approach to finding such fits is classification and regression trees (CART) complete with a book by L. Breiman and others.<p>But for a 'fit', commonly that's easy:  For some positive integer n and, for i = 1, 2, ..., n, we are given real numbers x(i) and y(i).  The x(i) are distinct.  Now we want a polynomial p of degree n - 1 so that p(x(i)) = y(i).  Okay, how to find p?  Easy.  I leave it as an exercise.  Problem is, p doesn't provide much as 'explanation'.<p>Generally, 'explanation' is tough to get at in part because it tries to get at causality which, just from data, as in the paper, is super tough to get at.<p>I mentioned C-PLEX for optimization problems.  Not all problems in NP are optimization problems.  But, curiously, integer linear programming bites off a lot of NP, and C-PLEX with associated techniques is one of the best approaches to integer linear programming.",1301776074

The reason the prestige of science and engineering declined is because the direct and visible impact on every day life of those professions has also declined. A lot of technical areas have matured since the 1950's and are offering mostly incremental improvements.<p>Not to say that the 'actual' impact has declined, but people in the United States are no longer impressed by a greener plastic or a slightly newer satellite being lofted into space. Compare that to places like China or even India that are somewhat behind in bringing industrialization to the entire population and you have engineers make visible impact to every day life and therefore rationally have more importance and thereby prestige. I'm sure that in a few decades once they start catching up, engineering will also start declining as a prestigious profession.<p>There are lots of other intellectually demanding professions such as law, medicine and even finance that have droves of bright students signing up. I think that while they attract students, and are useful at all stages of development, they really come up to the top once you have a stable political system, and a relatively wealthy population. Once technical change stops being radical you enter a maintenance phase. If you have basic health needs met you start trying to squeeze out more and more advances in medicine to prolong the life of a relatively healthy population. Once new products become mostly enhancements of old ideas, trying to compete using the law can be more efficient in terms of effort expanded to results achieved.<p>I think that trying to use marketing or propaganda to try and raise the prestige of scientists can only go so far. Technology needs to offer radical and easily visible everyday impact to outshine the other intellectual professions.",1301775690

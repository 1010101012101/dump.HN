2246397,comment,2244342,2246043,0,0,bryanh,,,"Thanks a bunch for the detailed examples. I've noticed this is a huge problem in my code: too many nested for loops. I've generally gotten better about using built in functions like set (in Python at least):<p><pre><code>    Out = list(set(A+B)) # right?\n</code></pre>\nOr even DISTINCT in SQL (when dealing with webapps).<p>And now I never doubt the usefulness of fuzzing the DB with hundreds of thousands of random entries. That quicky code that took 40ms to run over several dozen entries turns into a minute or more for several thousand.... Ouch! ;-)",1298311169

So if you rotate the square cover 45 degrees, you can kick it right down the hole no problem. Sure you could have a cover that was several inches bigger than the lip, but assuming the lip is only going to be on the order of .5-3"" and the cover is going to be around 24-36"" wide, you can always rotate the square one ot fall down there.",1298311150

Yes, data is more important than computer, and server-side computation and storage of data etc is increasingly important.<p>But the web as the client interface? Network-aware native apps are trumping all over it. These aren't the desktop apps PG speaks of, they're not shipped in boxes and they're not static. They're downloaded instantly, updated easily, network enabled and fully responsive.<p>Convenience over all is the thing for users, and apps are just more convenient. They don't load themselves from network every time (Gmail, Twitter), they don't have UI elements that fill in slowly as their graphics load over the network (Posterous and a million others), they don't transform without warning (Facebook) and they don't pretend that a way of sharing research papers can support an interactive session without you noticing.<p>As for the size of the Market, I've already spent way more on desktop and mobile software than I've ever spent on Saas/site subscriptions and I don't see that changing. Where there's a native app I'll almost always prefer it.<p>Why? Because native apps are better software; a better experience. And when they're supported by (synced/cached) server-side data (and ideally a fall back to a web client if I find myself at some random terminal somewhere) I get the best of both worlds.",1298311058

I was remarking on the limited information provided, not whether it's unfair or not to dismiss a resume based on grammar.  I'll just assume you inferred more from my comment than was stated.<p>> It's not insufficient information.<p>This is the <i>only</i> part of your comment discussion mine.  So, let's see what information is missing.<p>So, someone whose primary language is, let's say, Italian, French second, and English third is required to have impeccable English skills?  In Quebec, whose primary working language is French?  These aren't exceptions.  These are the rule outside the US.  Knowing 2 languages is common.  Knowing 3 is not at all unusual.<p>It's insufficient information precisely because it doesn't provide us any context.<p>Employer is where?\nEmployee is from where?\nEmployer is hiring for what position?  From where?\nEmployer has few/many candidates to choose from?\nEmployer seeking highly specific skill set?\nEnglish mistakes were real mistakes, and not merely a single typo?<p>Now, you can make a lot of assumptions and say that the employer was hiring someone from the USA, a native English speaker, for a job in the USA.  You can also make the assumption that the employer isn't looking for a specific skill set, and that the mistakes were more than just typos (despite that being the only example offered).  I can make a lot of assumptions.  But that's all it is, an assumption.<p>> the answer is unquestionably NO, it is not unfair.<p>Such a hard and fast rule.  Unquestionably?

I sure agree with them that it's possible to mess up with exceptions, sure, but the alternative -- using error codes is also prone to bugs.  For starters:<p>1) It means that you have to check the return value of every call. Miss one, and errors get ignored, which can result memory corruption or worse.<p>2) Checking return codes after every function call results in terribly verbose code/ Whereas exception-based error handling, when used in the right way, only needs catch() statements in places where the error is actually handled.<p>2) Every function has to return a status code. This hijacks the return value, meaning that you cannot simply return a value anymore, you always need to use output parameters.",1298311002

The language barrier exists, but is not strong enough that it has hindered any open-source efforts in Montreal (as far as I've seen).<p>The main hurdle to Montreal becoming any sort of startup hub is cultural. IMHO, Montrealais are not very opportunistic in starting and pursuing business.<p>I don't think this is Montreal-specific in any way, many cities are like this.<p>I think people are inspired most of all by other people they meet in their day-to-day lives, not images on TV or in media. The current difficulty is that Montrealais have very few positive role models around them, to show how it's done. In SF or NYC, you could easily move in a social circle that contains a successful business entrepreneur. ""Oh, if he could do it, then I can do that too!"" But most people in Montreal don't happen to know a successful tech entrepreneur, not even as an acquaintance in passing.<p>Note that I have found that Montrealais ARE very opportunistic when it comes to <i>social</i> entrepreneurism.

2246282,comment,2245978,2245978,0,0,jsr,,,"It's useful to differentiate between ""SQL Databases do not scale"" and ""SQL Databases do not _cost effectively_ scale"". The second argument is more accurate.<p>Vertical scaling of a DB is definitely an option for many people and has been used to scale many applications. However, the cost curve associated with buying bigger and bigger hardware is super-linear; doubling CPU & Memory in a single system leads to more than doubling the hardware cost. This can be problematic for many businesses whose revenue growth is exceeded by cost growth of the database.<p>Sharding is also an option for scaling, leveraged to great success by Facebook, Yahoo, and many others. However as the article points out, sharding prevents the developer from using many of the features that make a relational database a productive development environment. There are lots of foot guns that emerge in a sharded SQL environment and if you have not set up your development constraints appropriately, you can slow the pace of development considerably. This again leads to a cost problem because the incremental costs of adding features grows as you add more things like sharding around your database.<p>SQL is not useless and not hopeless. In a large number of cases, SQL is the right solution. However the techniques used to scale SQL tend to be options only to very large budget organisations. NoSQL solutions tend to be more cost effective in their scaling approach (scale out vs. scale up) without crippling the developers productivity. For these reasons, NoSQL solutions tend to be the better choice for the cost-conscious.",1298309819

I probably wrote close to a few hundred lines of F#. You know what ended up happening? I can't remember a lick of F#. How could that have happened?<p>I had no palpable reason to learn F#. I like writing web applications, and the ones that I do like to write have very little use for concurrency or functional programming (also the reason why I'm having trouble getting motivated to write any Haskell/Erlang).<p>Compare this with Ruby (Rails). I had an idea for a web app. I work on the .NET stack during the day and I wanted to learn another language. I heard that Python and Ruby were the best ones to pick up, and since they are so similar in terms of end goal, I chose Ruby because it simply intrigued me more. I've written close to a few thousand lines of Ruby and I'm at the point where I could write it ad hoc and make something off the top of my head. So what worked this time around?<p>The keywords here are ""idea"" and ""intrigue.""<p><i></i>The number one thing that will help you learn a new language is to have an idea of something you want to build.<i></i><p>It doesn't have to be a new idea. Maybe you want to try cloning ThreeWords.me. Maybe you want to automate picking stocks (a personal favorite). Whatever it is, you have to have an idea of something you want to build, not only because it helps you define the language you should use (and thus give you a compelling reason to learn X instead of Y), but also because it will give you the intrinsic motivation to retain that knowledge after you've executed on your idea. You'll feel like the language has a purpose in your life, an actual tool you can use from the proverbial programmer's toolbox.<p>The other piece, as I mentioned, is intrigue. You have to want to learn the language to really get any benefit from it. As I mentioned earlier, it ultimately came down to a gut feeling as to why I chose Ruby/Rails over Python/Django(/Pylons/Web2py). This is so important, because ultimately if you're already trying to learn a language outside of work, you've got an internal motivator that isn't driven by profit or work; it's driven by excitement and fun. So follow through on that promise to yourself to have fun by picking a language that makes coding fun! If Haskell bores you but Erlang gets you going, even if Haskell is considered to be a more hardcore functional language...WHO CARES! You're doing this for fun, NOT with a gun to your head or a job on the line. You need to do what's right for you. I don't think I've ever met an individual who said ""I picked the wrong language to learn, I'm dumber than I was before!""<p>TLDR: You need to have a reason to learn said language(s) by first having something to build. That will help you choose a subset of languages you'll actually want to learn. When filtering down between similar languages, go with your gut and choose the one that excites you the most. You simply can't go wrong, and there's no better way to learn a language faster than by building something you've always wanted to make.",1298309603

Once your required transactional context needs to scale large areas (geographically or logically) then the overhead of this is mighty. 2PC itself does not scale indefinitely, and while interesting research is being done in alternative transactional approaches, it would be tough to argue that any are acceptable solutions to the problem.<p>Also your example of banks is perhaps not an ideal one. While banks may indeed run some very large databases, they don't run one HUGE database which is expected to be always consistent.

But what happens once they pass the security line? (the body scanner didn't catch them before boarding the plane...?)<p>how do you identify a bot post in the wild?  It seems to me that there is an equal possibility that a post could be from a bot as it could be from a real person... is there a way to use distributions, and some kind of artificial intelligence to search for fingerprints?

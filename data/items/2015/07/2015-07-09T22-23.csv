Eg - Long Term Capital Management had Nobel Prize winning Laureates guiding its investment strategy and it went bust in the late 90&#x27;s as its models broke down due to market conditions outside the realm of its models.<p>Also - how does your fiduciary duty obligation jive with your robo advisor, which I assume is an automated process?  Are you manually checking each bit of advice it suggests as part of due diligence requirements?  And what happens if it has bugs?  Eg, if I&#x27;m a risk averse investor but your robo advisor had some buggy code and recommends I put 90% of my portfolio into emerging market equities, and I follow this erroneous advice and lose most of my investment, what recourse do I have against your company? Do you guarantee lost capital due to clearly wrong advice, or do I have to take you to court?  Just curious how you are planning to deal with this type of situation, because at some point it&#x27;s likely to happen (but maybe not as obvious as this example).<p>Also your link appears to be more of an opinion piece than purely factual statement on 401k advisors.",1436482607

There have been data binding frameworks used for well over a decade in JS development - I know I wrote one in the early 2000s. You can&#x27;t write a decently sized app in JS without developing something like data binding, unless you love busywork and bugs, or have zero prior experience of what came before in GUI frameworks.<p>Data binding is designed exactly to prevent the need to explicitly mutate all the views at every point that the model can change. Instead you write bindings that project the model into the view, and make the model reactive, so that changes to it propagate automatically. It&#x27;s the same in any decently sized Backbone app - that&#x27;s why the Collection and Model give you all these events.<p>What&#x27;s new in React is the idea of cheaply creating a virtual DOM and extracting a set of diffs from it that can then be applied to the real DOM. I did something vaguely similar, again in the early 2000s, but the motive then was to reduce the amount of data on the wire (the server had a data-bound model of what was displayed on screen, but only sent diffs back to the client). It&#x27;s a neat idea and an excellent implementation, but it&#x27;s not original or groundbreaking.",1436482513

9861161,comment,9857392,9860453,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"> Integer addition arithmetic is one of the most common operations your computer does, making that 2-10x or more slower would have catastrophic consequences.<p>Common Lisp is a compiled language that has arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic by default.  What we generally find is that in most kinds of code the cost of the conditional branch is negligible; it&#x27;s dwarfed by memory access, function call, and other conditional logic in the program.<p>There are, of course, exceptions.  Most of these are array operations where one is doing a small amount of work on each of a large number of array elements; array index computations are a good example of a place where one doesn&#x27;t generally want to pay the cost of overflow checking.  For those situations, Common Lisp provides declarations one can write to cause the overflow checking to be skipped.<p>The overall effect is far from catastrophic.  Common Lisp is competitive with other compiled languages -- not the very fastest, perhaps, but definitely in that range, and a good 10 to 30 times faster than interpreted Python or Ruby -- languages in which a lot of code is being written these days.<p>Now to this specific example.  What would have happened if it were written in CL?  If the programmer had not specified otherwise, the arithmetic would be done in arbitrary precision and would work correctly.  That&#x27;s clearly the correct choice in this case: even though an array index is being computed, it&#x27;s effectively a random index from the hardware&#x27;s point of view; cache prefetching will be no help at all.  That being the case, the performance will be dominated by memory latency (at least to the L2 and L3 caches, if not all the way to main memory).  Also, in many applications, the comparison between two elements will involve a function call; it won&#x27;t be just an integer less-than instruction.  So worrying about a couple of integer overflow tests would be pretty silly.<p>I concede the possibility that, this argument notwithstanding, the programmer might have turned off overflow checking anyway.  Well, you can shoot yourself in the foot in any language.  Lisp just tries to make it not be the default.",1436481574

I don&#x27;t have a lot of knowledge about how they&#x27;re managed, but I can&#x27;t imagine that much disparity in administrative fees.<p>And on the larger view, pensions represent a liability (I promise to pay Joe Sixpack 40% of his salary after ten years of service, some of which he will contribute to), while 401(k)s represent no liability at all. Work for the company 40 years and your 401(k) won&#x27;t cover your retirement? Too bad. Should have contributed more or invested better; the company doesn&#x27;t owe you anything. Or, for another example, if Joe lives to be 100 and he only planned for 76, that&#x27;s a major problem with a 401(k), but a pension would still have to pay out, and it would be on the company&#x27;s dime.<p>In addition, at least in my experience, company contributions to 401(k)s tend to be small and decreasing (for example, my company contributes a maximum of 3%, paid once a year) over time, and you have the additional complexity that vesting introduces, where (at least as I understand it), they can take it back if you quit roll your 401(k) over somewhere else.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure under what circumstances a 401(k) could ever not be cheaper.

A tax that applied to one and not the other would be very weird; it&#x27;s not clear what behavior it&#x27;s meant to encourage, and anyway lots of people would avoid paying it.<p>So the argument above is that &quot;realizing&quot; gains is a lot like getting change for a dollar bill. I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s <i>right</i>, but anyway it&#x27;s different from arguing about whether money is real :)",1436479859

Stratigraphic data are an important source of information in geoscientific disciplines such as geology, physical geography, archeology and beyond. Most scientists still store these kind of data in spreadsheets, with all its shortcomings (data exchange, versioning, schema definitions). In the private sector (ressource industries), central databases are well in use, but proprietary solutions mostly don&#x27;t fit the needs of geoscientific researchers. This is where I want to fill the gap by outlining an open source data exchange format based on GeoJSON, enabling client applications to build upon a standardized format. For avoiding schema problems with the endless possible attributes in use for stratigraphic data, the prototype stores the attributes for stratigraphic records in a document storage column of PostgreSQL, using the newly available JSONB datatype. Furthermore, PostgreSQL allows the use of PostGIS for spatial operations on the data, such as finding stratigraphic data by location.<p>There is also a demo client application as IPython notebook, showcasing the data analysis that is possible with data coming from the API.

I can take any other aircraft in the U.S. inventory and put it in situations where it will lose engagements against other domestic or foreign aircraft and systems. Multi-role fighters like the F-35, Rafale, Viper, Hornet, and Gripen aren&#x27;t meant to be dominant in any one specific area. They&#x27;re meant to be flexible platforms that can be tailored for different operations and flight packages based on the needs of the mission at the time, and like most multi-role fighters, they each tend to be a little better at certain roles than others.<p>Additionally, most of these criticisms act as if the F-35 will be acting alone on these missions, and don&#x27;t take into account the fact that other aircraft, radars, and offensive/defensive systems are meant to be utilized alongside the F-35. Such a micro view doesn&#x27;t adequately account for the actual theater of war these aircraft will take part in.<p>Is the JSF program enormously expensive? Yes. Is it unnecessary? Maybe. However, expensive and unnecessary are separate issues from whether or not this is a capable aircraft, of which it empirically is. Does it have kinks to work out? Definitely, but this aircraft is still in testing phases, and like all other aircraft, it will go through iterations and variations. In time, as systems mature, bugs are fixed, and pilots become more experienced, we can be sure that the F-35 will at least be a capable tool to warfighters.<p>Argue the cost, argue the need, but making the argument that the folks at Lockheed all of a sudden forgot how to build capable fighter aircraft is absurd.",1436479732

The F-111B was too big, too unmaneuverable, and had too many other problems so after about 6 years with an initial production of 7 aircraft the program was cancelled. The Navy went back to the drawing board, sought out new aircraft proposals, and eventually ended up with the F-14 to fulfill that role. There&#x27;s a long history of mistakes and bad designs in military history, but in the US at least most of those mistakes are accepted by the top brass, work arounds are developed, and better systems are procured as replacements. It&#x27;s a history of lessons learned and applied to future generations of weapons systems.<p>The F-35 on the other hand appears to not only be enormously flawed but government leadership has consistently refused to address or accept those flaws, and has instead doubled down on the program. The F-35 was sold based on some simple promises: that it would be cheaper than alternatives; that having a common design with 3 variants would reduce costs, increase reliability, and increase capabilities; and that it would be a next generation multi-role fighter capable of easily gaining the upper hand against any competitor in any theater in the world. All of those promises have been broken, utterly. The reality is that there are three completely different planes that have similar names, but the commonality between the different &quot;variants&quot; is only around 30%. Worse, the plane is hugely expensive to produce and even more expensive to operate, with a dismally low &quot;duty cycle&quot; (with a ratio of 3-5 hours of corrective maintenance needed for every single hour of flight time). Slowly but surely the cost of the F-35 is approaching the cost of the F-22 (which is a vastly more capable aircraft). And now we see that the planes aren&#x27;t actually very good at their job either.<p>It&#x27;s like going to the car dealership and trading in your beloved and trustworthy family automobile then the salesman selling you on the idea of a fun but inexpensive and reliable high performance sports car. Then when you get the car you realize that it&#x27;s a lemon, it has the performance of a Geo Metro but the gas mileage of a HUMVEE, it&#x27;s in the shop every week for some new problem or other, and then when you check the paperwork you see some stuff you didn&#x27;t notice when you signed and it actually cost 3x more than you thought. That situation would cause anyone to be pissed off. Unfortunately, the Pentagon is so in bed with LockMart/Boeing that they refuse to criticize it or do anything about it.",1436479660

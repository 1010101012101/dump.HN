Not only is this not standards compliant from what I recall, but I&#x27;ve noticed a disturbing amount of other mail servers that apparently require plaintext connections. Most notable is password and college application information which couldn&#x27;t be delivered to me because their mail servers refused to use TLS. The college in question was kind enough to look at their logs for me and see the issue, and ask me to disable TLS to receive the information. Of course this doesn&#x27;t solve all the problems. Mail is still stored in plaintext, at least until I figure out a workable solution for that, and there&#x27;s probably still the possibility of MITM attacks, but I feel at least requiring TLS is a step in the right direction.

There are a whole bunch of other options as well. C was easy to get and it came with the OS for many developers when computers became more accessible due to lower costs in the late 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s. C is slow is not an uncommon opinion among fortran programmers, for good reasons. In practice the C++ parts of the different JVMs are getting smaller each release.

Rust made a conscious effort to avoid exceptions for good reasons, and there&#x27;s no reason to suspect that Rust will suddenly pivot on its heel in the opposite direction. Despite your attempts to paint this as a slippery slope, the unwinding-halting mechanisms are there to provide a safety net for people writing Rust libraries that expose C ABIs so that library code can fail gracefully without taking down the parent process.<p><pre><code>  > the traditional exception model is simply the best one\n</code></pre>\nCitation needed. :P The Rust community has long since embraced Result-based error handling; I don&#x27;t hear calls for adding exceptions nearly as often as you seem to suspect. As to &quot;inevitability&quot;, you&#x27;ll be sad to learn that Rust plans on adding a mechanism that will enable applications to make panics impossible to catch, by disabling unwinding entirely and translating all panics to outright aborts (some argue that this should even be the default behavior of Rust code, but that won&#x27;t happen any time soon). And considering that Mozilla disables exceptions entirely in Firefox, I see no reason they would pressure the Rust developers to add exceptions to Rust.<p>You seem to be taking Rust&#x27;s approach to error handling far too personally. :P It is not Rust&#x27;s position that exceptions are a blight that must be scoured from the face of the Earth. It is merely Rust&#x27;s position that there are easier ways to achieve concise and composable error handling for its intended domain, given Rust&#x27;s other features and safety mechanisms.",1447245482

Same with so many who flaunt their fancy prose.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not a big reader of fiction.  I don&#x27;t mind fancy prose if the author book is interesting.  I know everyone has different interests, but I am tired of authors who ran out of interesting plots years ago, or never had any to begin with; but get seem to get by with fancy flowery prose?  To budding new writers, lay off the cigarette imagery. &quot;The room was beyond squalor.  The lit cigarette had burned down to the filter.  A blue albuteral inhaler was clenched in his right hand, like a baby holds a rattle.&quot;  Please, we got the imagery with &quot;He had a lit cigarette in the ashtray.&quot;<p>Or maybe, I&#x27;m wrong?<p>I wouldn&#x27;t take one word out of Nabrakov&#x27;s Lolita.  That said, there&#x27;s a lot of modern books I wish were under 200 pages. I just don&#x27;t see the need for 500 pages of anything.  That goes 10 fold for technical books.<p>I&#x27;m a poor reader with most fiction, or the fiction  I was forced to  read in college.   My reading skills improved greatly when I was given a tight, usually short story.  A Woody Allen story comes to mind.  And, I really liked Jack London&#x27;s book about freezing in the wilderness.  Forget the name of both stories, but I was astonished London wrote it on a beach in Hawaii, and the short story Woody wrote was in Playboy.  It had nothing to do with sex either.<p>Since, I&#x27;m not a big fiction reader, but I read a lot of non-fiction.  My hope is technical books in the future will get better--shorter--to the point.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind if technical authors used numbers to list their points?  1.  The idea.  2.  The procedure.  3.  Problems that might arise.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t even mind if author&#x27;s used numbering like in legal documents. I love visual technical books, but haven&#x27;t seen any done really well yet. And I see nothing wrong with techniclal books that use a comic book form--like some military manuals are written.<p>Again, I&#x27;m the last person who should comment on a person&#x27;s writing.",1447244928

Negative paper on vitamin C is almost non existent.<p>Speaking about the vitamin C and common cold, since you don&#x27;t have any good papers in mainstream medicine that tested Pauling protocol you must turn to those groups that did so and use it in every day practice - orthomolecular practitioners. I am sure you will recognize this is considered frindge science by mainstream medicine but that is irrelevant since they didn&#x27;t do the job. The situation is similar to that of vitamin C and cancer. Original claims by Pauling were not tested and instead we got Moertel studies on Mayo clinic that concluded that Pauling protocol does not good, except that they didn&#x27;t test it at all. Check out the history here, highly informative paper:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2981594/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2981594/</a><p>Most of the experiments were done by Dr. Cathcart who  treated over 20000 patients using vitamin C and extensively documented it. Book &quot;Ascorbate, the science of vitamin C&quot; by Hickey is also very informative.<p>But don&#x27;t limit yourself to common cold, just look everything that vitamin C does in the body, and I am sure you will change your opinion.<p>The fact is, AA is the main anti-stress molecule for the animal body (thats why they didn&#x27;t delegate production to plants and still produce high quantity of AA from glucose on daily basis), just as GSH is primary endogenous antioxidant and detoxication agent.<p>Humans did have some adaptation to GULO loss for sure, but modern lifestyle sure as hell topped that in other direction.<p>The major problem is dosing as half life of vitamin C is very low and you have to make the dose right in order to neutralize it or effects are not impressive. See this graph by Cathart:<p><a href=""http://www.doctoryourself.com/images/titr.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doctoryourself.com/images/titr.gif</a><p>which says that symptoms start to disappear only when you are very close to bowel tolerance. Notice the dose also - 1g per day is non existent compared to ~100g per day that Cathart used. I tried that many times, and it works for me. It is especially true for alcohol intoxication where the same protocol will bring you back from nonoperational to fully normal person in few hours.",1447244021

While I don&#x27;t often use find+replace, I do use project level find constantly.

Cmd+Shift+O then start fuzzy-typing the name of a file, method or declaration and hit return to jump to it in the editor (option+return for assistant editor).

So, for example, if you Cmd+Click a symbol to jump to its declaration, you can press Ctrl+Cmd+Left to go back.<p>The one thing I like about Xcode&#x27;s version of this is that it keeps track of source locations rather than files or windows.

If a shadow just looks roughly like the object that it casts, that should be enough.

For example, one could measure the error in any other L_p norm - e.g. L_1 or L_{\infty} instead of L_2. What&#x27;s so special about this one?<p>To answer that, we have the Gauss-Markov theorem [1] -- provided certain assumptions regarding the data are met, least squares is the best linear unbiased estimator.<p>Note, however, that no-one is forcing us to choose an estimator that is either linear or unbiased. What if by dropping one of those two somewhat arbitrary constraints we could get a better estimator?<p>One example of this is the James-Stein estimator [2], which is a biased estimator that has the amusing property of dominating (i.e., always performing no worse than, and performing strictly better than in some case) the bog standard least-squares estimate when one is dealing with data in three or more dimensions (and a few more common assumptions).<p>Crudely speaking, the James-Stein estimator produces estimates that are biased toward the origin, when compared to estimates produced from ordinary least squares. It is also possible to define a James-Stein estimator that biases toward an arbitrary fixed non-origin vector -- these variants also dominate the bog-standard ordinary least squares estimator!

5203588,comment,5200571,5202150,1,0,rmc,,,"Much of the EU <i>is</i> elected. The European Parliament is directly elected by the people, and the Commission is chosen by governments that are elected by the people, and the Council of Minister is the elected people themselves.<p>Any complaint about unelectedness of the EU could easily be applied to (say) the UK, or any other EU country. The UK civil service isn't elected by the people, but is instead sorta controlled by the directly elected people. David Cameron is current UK Prime Minister, but only the people of  Witney could vote for/against him. Is that democratic? Actually commissioners change more often than members of the UK civil service, so the EU is probably <i>more</i> democratic.<p>Complaints about the unaccountability of EU by the people could just as easily apply to many other EU countries (like UK). How many people in the UK vote regularly? It shows that many people don't know/care about the process.<p>These arguments about 'the unelected and unaccountable EU' are really just misleading arguments, since those complaints aren't used against other unelected or unaccountable governments like the UK, but are only used against the EU. England alone used to be 7 different kingdoms (~1,500 years ago), why not split it back like that again if the UK government is so undemocratic?",1360619948

On the order of a few Watts.  Maybe a few tens of Watts at most.  It's an order of magnitude less than what is needed to run seat heaters (and those have almost no measurable effect on a Model S's range, which is why ""range mode"" uses seat heat in favor of air conditioning).  The energy use you're talking about is enough to move the car an extra few hundred feet after a multi-hundred mile drive.<p>Second, every ICE has a thermostat on the radiator.  It greatly reduces coolant flow to the radiator when the car is warming up, or any other time that the coolant is below optimal temperature.  I spent many years in the northern (continental) United States and <i>never</i> encountered a situation where the coolant temperature gauge on an ICE car failed to show normal operating temperature after 10-20 minutes of warm-up time.<p>The cold-weather fuel economy difference in a conventional car mostly comes down to greater air density.",1360619792

5203539,comment,5201946,5203443,2,0,mikeash,,,"Apple provides push notifications, which work similar to SMS messages, in that your server can push data to the device without needing the device to poll, due to deep integration with the lower level cellular whatsis. I think Android has something similar as well, but I'm not completely familiar with it.<p>Basically, IP over 3G works pretty well overall but can be a real battery hog, and dropping down to something more native can be a big win. Cellular radios are built to use very little electricity while monitoring for a wakeup call from the tower they're connected to, so if you can take advantage of that like push notifications let you do, then you'll do a lot better.<p>A somewhat less wonderful alternative is to keep a persistent TCP connection open with a very long timeout, with the remote end sending a notification to wake up the phone when needed. You'll have no traffic most of the time, and the wakeup being initiated from the remote end removes the need to poll. I believe this is how Skype (and other VoIP apps that allow incoming calls in the background) works on iOS.<p>Edit: I forgot another technique that some iOS developers have used: register with the ""significant location change"" API, which can be used to wake up your app when the cell radio switches towers, and then check for new data then. This is technically an abuse of the API (which is intended for when you actually need to know about location changes) but works well enough. It can help to e.g. ensure your stuff is recently synced before the user goes into the subway and beyond data coverage. Once again, this is using low-level cell radio stuff to avoid overtaxing things.",1360619526

That didn't follow what dnu said at all. You weren't ""reiterating"" anything - you never said anything about ""your uses"", coldtea did, much farther up the thread. (If you're coldtea, then I understand your point, but if that's the case, you should have made that clear, as it vastly changes the context of what you were saying). You just brought up some benchmarks, which are not representative of how Python is used in the real world.<p>I see how you could have intended to imply that this was ""your uses"" by saying that coldtea must have unusual uses if he got go/2 performance out of Python, but this was hardly clear, if it is the case.

Sure, Django might introduce some slowness, but the vast majority of web performance is in the networking and database layers, not the application layer. Your choice of language has little to no bearing on the networking aspect of things, but what do you think the database drivers are written in? C, or an equivalent. 10% of the code that has 90% of the performance impact - sound familiar? And you interact with database drivers most of the time exactly how I said - by using a Python library that wraps around a C library to run the database.<p>>>Quit with the straw man arguments - they add nothing to the discussion.

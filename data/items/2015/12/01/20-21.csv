Within engineering we are a passionate group of people who are extremely interested in building the software that helps our customers around the country thrive in their local communities. We’re a pretty small team (currently 22 people) so you’ll have plenty of say around how we develop software going forward.\nWe are currently in the process of modernizing our software platform to be more modular and truly data driven. Our goal is to use data to make sure that we provide the right content to the right consumer at the right time. We’re building our internal API using REST based services implemented in Java, and while our front end is currently implemented in PHP, we are migrating away from that. Some of the technologies that we’re using: Dropwizard, Flyway, React, CloudFormation, Troposphere, and Ansible. All new engineers get company provided downtown parking, flexible work hours, 100% of their health insurance premiums paid for by the company, the ability to build their own work computer, and access to our kitchen with plenty of drinks and snacks. We’re looking for individuals only so please NO RECRUITERS OR AGENCIES (seriously, your emails will just go into the trash folder so let&#x27;s save each other&#x27;s time). In addition we’re looking for full-time employees who are already in Austin, TX or willing to relocate.<p>---<p>Founded in 2010, Main Street Hub is the CRM for Local. We offer an integrated social, web, and email marketing solution designed to help merchants get more customers and keep them coming back by spreading word of mouth, extending their customer service, managing their online reputation, and leveraging the Main Street Hub’s merchant network.

Dan (author of Redux) has said that he read the Elm Architecture document before creating Redux, and didn&#x27;t fully understand it. But he believes that it did influence the design of Redux.<p>> JAMISON:  So had you played with or heard of ELM beforehand or did you just realize the parallels afterwards?<p>> DAN:  Yeah. There&#x27;s been this, I&#x27;m feeling guilty about it because I had this Twitter exchange with Evan. Evan was a bit uncomfortable with me not mentioning Elm as much as he thought I should. I felt that yeah, he&#x27;s probably right because I read about Elm a few times before actually creating Redux. I&#x27;m not sure if… when you get inspired by something but don&#x27;t fully understand it and later you kind of reproduce it but you don&#x27;t really get this connection and you only get it later. So I think that&#x27;s kind of what happened because I distinctly remember reading about ELM architecture but I was thrown out by the syntax, so I didn&#x27;t fully understand what&#x27;s going on there. Later after some initial iterations of Redux, Andrew Clark actually showed me how it&#x27;s similar to Elm if we changed some things. We did change them.<p>> Yes, I have not actually played with Elm yet. I&#x27;ve seen other people playing with it. I&#x27;ve seen some demos but I have not actually played with it myself. I really want to but I&#x27;m stuck in maintaining and GitHub issues and I can&#x27;t find the time. I don&#x27;t know.

With A9X however, it’s a tablet SoC that doesn’t face the same power restrictions, and as a result doesn’t need a power-saving cache. This would be coupled with the fact that with double the GPU cores, there would be a lot more pressure on just a 4MB cache versus the pressure created by A9, which in turn may drive the need for a larger cache and ultimately an even larger die size.</i>&quot;<p>So, basically, while the A9&#x27;s 4 MiB L3 cache wouldn&#x27;t have been much to add to the A9X, it wouldn&#x27;t have helped much and a larger, more costly L3 cache would have been needed to help the A9X performance-wise.

In aerospace margins are usually thin and it&#x27;s easy to have the sign error.<p>1) I fully agree that air-breathing engines are heavier per unit of thrust. Merlins - pretty good rocket engines by that parameter - lift, as you say, 150 times their weight; for air-breathing engines it&#x27;s 5-10.<p>2) Aircraft engines usually don&#x27;t need to be particularly thrusty; wings generate lift, so you can take off even with T/W < 1.<p>3) Liquid oxygen has density about 1.1 that of water. Kerosene, in comparison, is about 0.8. Difference less than 1.5 times, but the mass ratio is more like 2.5:1, so ditching oxygen tanks - especially at the start, when the system is relatively heavy - can save quite a bit.

The reality I think is that it&#x27;s being pushed a little and pulled a lot by the mainstream of the market.<p>By mainstream I mean non-tech-savvy users, non-hackers. That&#x27;s most people. I can completely understand how <i>wonderful</i> a &quot;managed platform&quot; like iOS is to a non-technical user. No malware! (Or at least greatly reduced risk of it.) No OS rot! No IT! No complicated system administration! It&#x27;s like replacing a hand-cranked car by one with electronic ignition and an engine that doesn&#x27;t constantly need retuning.<p>For most people &quot;freedom&quot; means the freedom to get crapware and malware, spend hours that you can&#x27;t spare futzing with your computer and getting nothing done, and have to reinstall your OS every year because it gets borked. Non-hackers <i>hate</i> platforms like that with a passion that it&#x27;s difficult to understand. I often try to communicate it by comparing it to cars: how would you feel if you had to tune your engine every week, manually inspect every tank of gas for adulterants, and periodically stop your car to perform an inspection as you drive down the highway?<p>At the same time, the car analogy is deeply imperfect. In the computing world when you trade Windows or OS X for iOS you&#x27;re giving up a lot of capability and a lot of freedom. Tech-savvy and professional users either don&#x27;t want to give that up or as is the case with developers <i>can&#x27;t</i> give it up.<p>But the problem is that non-tech-savvy users are most of the market, especially as computing becomes more and more mainstream, and most of the market <i>is the market</i> for a large company like Apple. Edges of markets don&#x27;t matter. As such, I see the majority opinion of the market pulling things away from open platforms and rich capability and toward a managed, simplified, jailed, iOS-like future.<p>I think there&#x27;s a real risk that the professional will be left with a choice between the awful UX offered by pure OSS and being forced to adapt to iOS or similar platforms.<p>Hey, maybe it&#x27;ll prod the OSS folks into really taking UX seriously.<p>Yeah.<p>I&#x27;m not encouraged by what I see there nor by the combative/ultra-defensive attitude you get in those circles if you bring up this topic. One camp will insist that the latest Linux desktop or Ubuntu phone or whatever is <i>great</i> and is <i>totally comparable to iOS and OSX</i> and call you an idiot (and worse) for daring to think otherwise, and the other camp will just call you an idiot for &quot;needing&quot; UX or even a GUI at all because &quot;real men&quot; blah blah blah and why don&#x27;t you read e-mail in emacs? I used to wade into those debates from time to time, but I stopped after I wrote a blog post (years ago) about Linux usability with some ideas about how to improve UI/UX development on Linux and the responses were full of insults I hadn&#x27;t heard since Jr. High... not to mention one DDOS attack against the server.",1449002749

But, if you allowed the clients to have the same babysitter, same chef, and at the same time have an algorithm that is superior to everything else on the market, yes, the &quot;Uber for Babysitting&quot; idea is a stupid one, an obvious one, but execution is far above a &quot;common guy&quot; startup.",1449002616

Makes it really easy to get a reading on things.<p>Though it&#x27;s possibly hard to appreciate this until you&#x27;ve battled it out in the trenches with an abstraction that isn&#x27;t so simple, especially on a large, complex app.<p>I personally found Redux (w/ React) immediately accessible and think it&#x27;s a good place to start, especially if you&#x27;re already coming from React or you want to reap the benefits without leaving Javascript. I&#x27;d feel really comfortable using Redux on any team project that was already using React and some other Flux&#x27;y implementation.<p>I&#x27;ve also been learning Elm this past week though it&#x27;s taking me far longer to become productive since there are fewer resources and I have no ML experience. I&#x27;ve managed to create a simple Spreeder.com-style speed-reader (<a href=""https://www.danneu.com/elm-speed-reader/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.danneu.com/elm-speed-reader/</a>), and if you look at the source code (<a href=""https://github.com/danneu/elm-speed-reader/blob/master/Machine.elm#L70"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/danneu/elm-speed-reader/blob/master/Machi...</a>), you can see that it&#x27;s not much different from the counter-app example I pitched above where the `update` function reduces across a stream of actions including button clicks and the tick.

Discrimination and harassment are actions, which may or may not be based in bigotry.  I am in no way advocating that it is okay to discriminate against or harass people based on their identity.  Speech can be an action, but it can also just be speech.  It&#x27;s not a simple line, but I think it&#x27;s well defined in the law and well understood in society the difference between a statement of opinion, which may or may not be bigoted, and harassment.<p>Also, I&#x27;d like to point out that you&#x27;re awfully focused on my statements around bigotry.  Bigotry is a consequence of humanity, but it&#x27;s also something that can be changed through education and discussion.  The very reason why it&#x27;s important to protect <i>dissenting speech</i>, is because it&#x27;s a protection for society against bigotry.  The movement that&#x27;s currently happening around &quot;safe spaces&quot; is not merely a reaction to bigotry, it&#x27;s also a reaction to dissenting opinions, ignoring the latter for the former because the former makes an easy target to argue against due to its inappropriateness and unpopularity does not change the facts of the matter.<p>I think part of our misunderstanding is that we disagree on what is entailed in a &quot;discussion&quot; and what is entailed in the term &quot;safe space&quot;.  To me, a discussion must have, among other things, diversity of thought or position.  This implies that there will be dissent.  In the usage of the term &quot;safe space&quot; that I&#x27;ve experienced, dissent was not allowed, in fact it was in some cases violently rejected.  If there is no room for dissent, then what exists within is not a discussion, it&#x27;s a group affirmation.  You do not walk away from a group affirmation having learned anything, although it might make you feel better about yourself.  A discussion provides the possibility of learning something, gaining awareness of other viewpoints, understanding of someone who is different than you, and perhaps the possibility of convincing someone else to change their viewpoint to share yours.<p>On a university campus in a shared space, I&#x27;d very much hope that any discussion that occurs about any topic, but especially topics of politics and social mores has room for dissent.  For instance, I&#x27;d hope that my dissenting opinion regarding the existence or establishment of &quot;safe spaces&quot; would be welcome, if not applauded in a discussion about identity politics on a university campus.  At the same time, if I were on said campus and I heard someone expressing a grossly bigoted opinion, such as something which is blatantly racist or sexist, I would confront them and provide them my dissenting viewpoint to their bigotry and hope that it were welcomed, if not embraced by the person who I was having the disagreement with.  University life is supposed to be about having your viewpoints that you grew up with challenged, meeting new people who are different than you, finding out about the vast diversity of opinions and thought that exists in the world, and opening your mind to the possibilities that life holds.  When we use social means to censure people and demand the cessation of dissent in the name of not causing offense, we trade away the possibility of teaching students about the vast possibilities of the world in favor of not rocking the boat.",1449001295

Accordingly, editing has been cut back drastically pretty much across the board in response to increasingly tight budgets.<p>[1] Much more expensive than one might assume without having experienced the process.

Self editing is much faster (and therefore cheaper), but you get blind to errors that would jump out at someone else, and so errors slip through much more readily.

In fact, I don&#x27;t even see why this would eventually lead itself to be true, unless you already consider bigotry and hatred to be the majority norm in a very pervasive sense. I could write more on the matter, but others have done some considerable study on the matter [1]. I would say that overall being tolerant of intolerance is a good thing, because these people naturally exclude themselves from social structures and circles of power where they are expected to maintain a leadership role towards those they are bigoted against. Further, by integrating intolerant people with those of us who are tolerant, there is more chance for them to learn why their hatred may be misplaced, and for us to learn where the boundaries of our own personal expression should be.<p>Thinking merely that we must &quot;stamp out all hatred&quot; is in fact a form of hatred in itself. You can&#x27;t fight fire with fire here.<p>[1] <a href=""http://heterodoxacademy.org/2015/09/23/how-marcuse-made-todays-students-less-tolerant-than-their-parents/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://heterodoxacademy.org/2015/09/23/how-marcuse-made-toda...</a>",1449001020

What&#x27;s interesting is I don&#x27;t think the goal of these &quot;safe spaces&quot; is at all to foster &quot;free discussion&quot; or &quot;open development of ideas&quot;. What you see people rallying against is that the SJWs are shutting down any free discussion through these tactics.<p>For example, these &quot;safe spaces&quot; apparently are to protect against &quot;micro-aggressions&quot; (a term I only recently learned) which if I understand correctly means to &quot;take offense where none was given&quot; aka to put words into someone&#x27;s mouth? So now it&#x27;s not even what someone is saying but how someone in the audience might feel, because of their own personal history, indirectly because a word the speaker used. And this is the speaker&#x27;s responsibility now that someone in the audience was made to feel this way because they were confronted with a disagreeing opinion?<p>I think this is where the accusations of mollycoddling come in. It sounds like these kids aren&#x27;t ready for serious academic discourse. They&#x27;re stuck in a world where there is only one &quot;right&quot; and they paint caractures of their racist and bigoted antagonists to support their view.<p>What I find noxious is warfangle&#x27;s claim that we must all be sexist and bigots to raise questions around academic freedom and censorship in colleges / universities... I think this is a typical parlor trick to try to shut down productive discussion. Frankly I would have liked to see a rebuke from dang in response. Why is it ok to attack a group saying a viewpoint is &quot;disgustingly indicative of the inherent sexism and flat-out hatred that worms its way through developer culture.&quot; All the same, I&#x27;ll let warfangle speak for themself and I don&#x27;t expect HN to be free from dissenting opinions or even vitriol.

As I mentioned, I am addressing the line of argument, not the case.<p>What I amsaying is that when the &quot;freedom of speech&quot; flag only gets hauled out for pro-bigotry straight white guys, I think it&#x27;s not really about freedom of speech but instead  defense of privilege. If defenders of free speech want to convince me they&#x27;re serious, they&#x27;ll be just as vigorous in defending unpopular opinions of people not in their demographic.<p>That may even be you, in which case, congrats. But unlike you, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unconditionally bad that some people are afraid to express opinions because they may face social consequences for them. E.g., if some of the Donald Sterlings of the world are now afraid to express their bigotry, that&#x27;s ok by me. And if some people are afraid to publish something because they aren&#x27;t sure whether or not it&#x27;s bigoted, I also have a hard time seeing that as bad. That seems like a fine opportunity for them to consider their opinions before publishing them.<p>In fact, I think that&#x27;s what most people do. The only thing that&#x27;s different is that straight white guys now have to do the same sort of self-managing that everybody else has always done, because they&#x27;re now slightly less insulated from the consequences of their actions.",1449000482

The N1 app can cache your entire archive in about 10% of the disk space required if you also download all unprocessed headers+attachments.<p>Right now our search implementation just sends a proxy request to the IMAP search, so you&#x27;ll get the same performance as Gmail web, Mac Mail, etc. It&#x27;s not ideal.

It&#x27;s an analysis and recommendation engine built on search data for each site. That data used to be directly available to and collected by HitTail, since search terms were in the referring URLs of every visit to the site coming from a search engine.<p>Now that Google virtually never includes search terms in referring URLs, the only way HitTail can get the data it needs is via Google&#x27;s APIs. Google can change the API, remove the API, or change the terms of use, and HitTail&#x27;s SOL. Already they only have access to a subset of search data the API makes available, rather than <i>all</i> long-tail keywords, which they had a few years ago.<p>Will Google remain friendly to tools like this in the future?

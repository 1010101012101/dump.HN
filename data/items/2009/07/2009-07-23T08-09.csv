If the economy where stronger in 3rd world countries, there would be more competition for workers. Therefore the companies hiring would have to offer better conditions to keep the workers.<p>I guess that is assuming an open market, too. It does not quite apply to dictatorships and slavery. Unless you count ""flee to a neighboring country"" as an option, which it probably isn't in most cases.<p>Edit: I guess even slavery does not completely invalidate the concept. If demand was high enough, prices for slaves would rise. Eventually it would be high enough for slave owners to sell, and effectively the new owners would have to offer freedom as a price.<p>Also neighboring countries would be willing to accept refugees if they had a high demand for labor.",1248339364

719236,comment,718132,718735,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"<i>Modern, first-world standards cannot be applied to the third world...</i><p>That's part of the problem, though, isn't it?  The tremendous migration of manufacturing jobs to third world countries has been in large part because they are not limited to a 40 hour work week and first world safety standards.  Of course it's cheaper to manufacture in China, their regulations are a lot more lax than ours, although that may be changing.<p>I, too grew up in a Third World country.  My parents were missionaries in Central America in the 80's.  I grew up playing soccer with children who's bellies were bloated from parasites and could not afford shoes.<p>I've worked in communities that were essentially indentured servants to the tomato packing industry.  The tomato company owned the housing, ran the schools, provided plumbing, etc.. to their workers.  The employees were willing to put up with indentured servitude, because on a certain level because it was better than starving.  It was better for their children to get a 6th grade education and then go off to pick tomatoes than to have no education at all.<p>Why did that happen?  So we can have tomatoes at our local grocery store for $1 a pound.<p>I agree that it is better for the people in the third world to have jobs rather than not have jobs, but I'm pretty conflicted about the entire situation. Starving children, vs children working 16 hours a day in a tomato field?  That's not a good choice to have to make.",1248338480

719233,comment,718774,718774,0,0,mattj,,,"I really like scala a lot - it's a joy to write fast, succinct code with just a pinch of magic, but I have to strongly agree with all but the first critique. Scala has the underpinnings of an absolutely incredible language (fast, expressive, jvm compatible being the highlights), but the surface implementation leaves a lot to be desired.<p>Basically, scala is desperately in need of a ""Scala: The Good Parts"" book.<p>On a side note, using scala has really served to increase my respect for many of the apache java libraries. They're horrible to use from java, but really top notch when you have access to a higher level programming environment.",1248338188

His post reeked of FUD, but this post actually makes sense to me.<p>I quite like C#, especially 3.0, as a language. I am equally saddened that it is encumbered by hate as it is by fear. I honestly don't think Microsoft would start a mutually assured destruction war, but I've been wrong in the past. That said, I still wouldn't use it for an open source project because it is a political death sentence for any community-driven project :-( can't we all just get along?",1248337431

I'm new here, but far too often I see thoughtful posts like this being hit hard.<p>Here's a guy, obviously with some ideas banging around in his head, who feels (rightly or wrongly) that the system as-is is broken. He complains about it, then offers a solution. It seems a reasonable solution and with some tweaks to his/her basic parameters (I  think +3/-1 are too constrained) this could work well.<p>I agree that the spirit of HN seems to be to have good chats on topics and subtopics, and some of the abuses I see around here really scare me off from posting more.",1261720673

1014798,comment,1014537,1014537,0,0,ashley,,,"When you say, ""my family helped me get that money...I feel like I shouldnt risk their money,"" do you mean that your family helped to co-sign your loan or act as guarantors?  If that is the case, then no, you really should pay off the debt.  And idlewords is right, you can use the time to learn about working in a team.  Or even network to find cofounders.  From your statement ""I've been thinking I might try for YC"", I'm guessing perhaps you haven't found co-founders yet?  Paul Graham's essays tend to stress the importance of good co-founders.<p>But if they helped you get the loans in some way that doesn't involve their credit getting damaged should you fall behind on payments, maybe you should talk to a financial counselor about options, like consolidating loans or asking for a forbearance due to unemployment/hardship.  That's going to make your loan principal grow very large though.<p>So I also think that working for a few years to pay off the loans is the best idea because then you can focus on your startup without the stress of looming monthly loan payments on top of earning no salary whilst developing, but perhaps you should ask someone who can give more specific advice.  Not to sound harsh, but it seems that by asking internet boards, you're looking for a way to alleviate your conscience, both to yourself (in terms of your life ambitions) and to your family (in expectations and finance).  Don't worry too much  Good luck with whatever decision you make!",1261720421

1014796,comment,1012472,1014674,0,0,elblanco,,,"First off, Happy Holidays!<p>Now back to arguing about something...<p>Then that intent should be on the guidelines page, and not in the imagination in your head...period. I think pg does a good job at relaying the intent of how he thinks things should work in his various essays. I disagree with him on some fine points. He wants more civility, I want more directness. I also don't want people to pretend to be civil in voice and absolutely uncivil in action.<p>Furthermore, guidelines are not rules:<p>Since you have trouble understanding the difference betwixt the two:<p><a href=""http://lmgtfy.com/?q=define%3Aguidelines"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=define%3Aguidelines</a><p><a href=""http://lmgtfy.com/?q=define%3Arule"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=define%3Arule</a><p>I think you can probably tell by now I really don't give a rats ass about my karma, to the chagrin of people that think I'm only whining about mod points -- but I do care about interesting discussion (which includes meta-discussion). You seem to think discussion is only <i>interesting</i> if it follows some rule-set you've invented that really has nothing to do with the intent or words of the guidelines of HN or even in most cases (as provided by citations) to yourself unless it's particularly convenient for you to pull them out to suppress voices you don't want to hear -- such as mine.<p>As I've outlined, mod points and abuses of the voting system can suppress interesting discussion exactly as it has done here both by encouraging non-interesting discussion and by discouraging dissenting voices. You are even aware that the voting system is open to abuse! <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1013389"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1013389</a> Yet here we are, with you participating in your own support and participation in an abuse of the system.<p>You've provided nothing even remotely interesting along the lines of meta-discussion regarding this topic in all of your previous posts that I could be bothered to read through except pedantic reference to the guidelines page from time to time. At the very least I supplied an alternate voting and comment scheme (which is perhaps a poor scheme, but I'm open to it being up for debate, at least it's some ideas). Most assuredly you don't like it since it would force people such as yourself to be bothered to provide some commentary and not just whore karma.",1261720306

1014790,comment,1014211,1014698,0,0,dnewcome,,,"Looking at one side of a balanced transmission line is not really very useful on a scope since there is no reference that is meaningful other than the other side of the line. Of course there would be lots of noise looking at only one side, since the whole idea of a twisted pair line is to take advantage of common-mode noise rejection at the receiving end.<p>Thinking about things more, you'd need to do the same common mode rejection in the tap in order to not be overwhelmed by line noise, necessitating the use of two pickups per pair. Careful physical design could allow a very sensitive pickup to be designed while canceling noise common to both. However, as you pointed out, low current could make things impossible still. But... the line is driving an inductive coupling in the form of a transformer at the end in order for things to work in normal operation though, so instinctively I think that something could be made to work.<p>As for not being worth it, you are probably right, especially since both approaches could be detected with the proper equipment.",1261719683

1014784,comment,1009137,1009335,0,0,cemregr,,,"I am a Turk who learned Finnish as an adult. A striking similar between Turks and Finns is that both think their language is phonetic/read-as-written. While Finnish performs definitely better than Turkish in this aspect, both are far from being perfectly phonetic.<p>As the other comment mentioned Finnish isn't that phonetic at all. Even the simple ""tervetuloa"" is actually pronounced as ""tÄrvetuloa"".<p>But out of all languages I've learned/tried to learn, Finnish definitely is relatively more rule-abiding. And it has a huge bonus of being very obscure as to be used as a secret language :)",1261718975

It will be educational for you to do it, and for us to read it.<p>Second, I think you just pull the plug.  You can put an announcement on your homepage, giving your users notice, and email them, as well, if you have their emails.  You could even send them the post detailing your journey and why it is ending, to give them a bit of a feeling of closure, and not feeling just left out in the cold.<p>Take the code.

Using [1] for reference, if the download speed is less than ~20MB/s, LZMA is faster than DEFLATE.  Though, the data there is a bit less compressible than these csv files, so the break-even point for transfer rate would be higher here; even so, in my case, the download speed was much slower than 20MB/s.<p>1. <a href=""http://richg42.blogspot.com/2015/01/parallelized-downloaddecomp-with.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://richg42.blogspot.com/2015/01/parallelized-downloaddec...</a>",1423079992

Among those that are controlled, there a few different strategies.<p>The best strategy is an &quot;active control&quot; group which receives some combination of education, attention from instructors, group therapy and the like which is matched with the meditation group for time and attention. This has subsets of &quot;specific active control&quot; in which the control is a known procedure (like exercise or progressive muscle relaxation) or &quot;non-specific active control&quot; in which the control procedure is not a known effective procedure and so is expected not to have any effect.<p>The other main control group used is a &quot;wait list&quot; or &quot;usual care&quot; control, in which the participants don&#x27;t receive any treatment or only receive the treatment you would usually get for the condition under study, which isn&#x27;t matched with the meditation group for time and attention.",1423079985

For network, because Google loves protobufs, we have a network channel abstraction between client and server, or between processes, that can send/receive protos. For storage, we have an IndexDb like abstraction.<p>We hand-rolled our dependency injection stuff, but if we did it again, we&#x27;d just use Dagger 2 which works on all platforms.<p>We are second guessing our decision to go with an IndexDB abstraction. The code to use this is not very maintainable, and so we&#x27;re looking at moving to a SQL-lite-ish kind of abstraction for storage.

Whereas you can&#x27;t call yourself a lawyer until you&#x27;ve passed the bar, which almost always involves attending 3 years of law school.  So it&#x27;s not really an apples to apples comparison.  There is really no barrier to entry to programming that sets a minimum bar.  So if you&#x27;re comparing something with a minimum education standard with something with no minimum standard… well then yeah.<p>But personally, I don&#x27;t think the required training to become a lawyer is anywhere close to as rigorous as what it takes to become a brain surgeon or rocket scientist, and if you look at typical pre-law majors, they aren&#x27;t as difficult or rigorous as common undergrad degrees for software developers (CS, math, engineering, physical sciences).

I didn&#x27;t have all the resources of the internet to help (this was 1980)<p>Like the article mentions there&#x27;s just a ton to learn. 6 months of Code Academy will help you learn basic stuff, variables, loops, conditionals, maybe even objects and classes but only experience will help you with databases, files, sorting, patterns, threads, memory issues, debugging, big O thinking, cache coherence, performance, etc, etc and all the other stuff.<p>That comes from doing and doing over years and years.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s something about certain people? I watched a guy with almost zero programming experience go through some tutorials online and then apply for a software engineering position at google. From everything he said he seemed confident he was going to get the job and was going to be very depressed if he didn&#x27;t. All I could think was &quot;REALLY? You really think 3 months of study makes you a programmer ready for Google?&quot;. I didn&#x27;t say anything. Who am I to step on his dreams. Maybe he&#x27;d some how fake his way in.<p>He didn&#x27;t<p>But it made me wonder why did he believe that that was all he needed in the first place? I think that&#x27;s actually the more interesting discussion. There&#x27;s a ton to learn in programming. You can learn some basic stuff quickly and maybe make some lights light up on your arduino art project but why would anyone think 2 to 6 months of study would make them ready for a programming job?

Secondly, some countries seize deposits after 2 years of inactivity to an unclaimed financial assets fund (2 years isn&#x27;t alot considering the quite-manual processes involved in developing countries to get your assets back.<p>On the other hand you get a decent amount of interest on amounts which could be less than $0.50 worth (so long as you&#x27;re active) and this is better than holding cash/any argument against holding cash.

I have implemented a lot of rules engines, and removed a fair number of them too since the late 90&#x27;s.  I generally removed them because they created a dependency nightmare, added crazy complexity and required significant extra test conditions that the application just didn&#x27;t need to have. This can slow your development down considerably for smaller applications and cause great frustration.  Which is not what a rules engine should do.<p>My basic starting thoughts is that if the rules are well known, change infrequently, have minimal nested chaining and number < 50 or so then I&#x27;d opt for having a good design pattern or simple if/else within the code.  If you violate any of these tenants, then I&#x27;d look at decision tables/trees first, then after that move to a rules engine. Of course, if users are required to write their own then that would also have to factor in to this decision. BTW -- Don&#x27;t dismiss a good design pattern or even a plug-in pattern as sometimes that is more than enough to solve moderately complex rules without adding additional dependencies or significant development complexity.<p>If this is an application that will be deployed to third party sites, then again, I generally opt for a balance between the number of dependencies and the application maintenance.  If it is deployed behind a website or application where your company controls the environment, then I focus more on flexibility and application maintenance than dependencies.<p>Also, in a few less common scenario&#x27;s, I have written very basic purpose built rules engines that solved some of the key issues without creating needless complexity, maintenance or dependency nightmares.  Not that I advocate writing libraries/code that already exists, but many times you just don&#x27;t need a Drools, or ilog rules etc.  Also, this is where something like embedded JavaScript is a handy tool as pjungwir also mentioned.",1423078669

If you really want to show the extent to which a language can be inherently reasoned about, it seems like a slight-of-hand to provide hints in the names.<p>Take a look at this snippet from example 6:<p><pre><code>    // create a repository
    var repo = new CustomerRepository();

    // find a customer by id
    var customer = repo.GetById(42);
</code></pre>
The fault is &quot;I can&#x27;t tell by looking at this code whether a null is returned or not.&quot;<p>The improvement is this (in a language without nulls or exceptions):<p><pre><code>    // create a repository
    var repo = new CustomerRepository();

    // find a customer by id and
    // return a CustomerOrError result
    var customerOrError = repo.GetById(42);
</code></pre>
Aside from the comments and a change to the variable name, isn&#x27;t this code identical? The fact that subsequent code must process the result specially if the input (42) is garbage is true of any language, whether or not null is allowed. I still can&#x27;t tell &quot;by looking at it&quot; what is happening.<p>In fact, I would reason differently about this code if the comments were removed and the names changed:<p><pre><code>    var a = new B();
    var c = d.E(42);
</code></pre>
In this context, it seems the real error is that an invalid parameter value is passed, so I&#x27;d see if I could fix that first, <i>possibly</i> eliminating the need for any error handling code. That approach might be common for a functional mindset, but not exclusively so.",1423078651

I benchmarked BoltDB against LevelDB and other local key-value stores around a year ago, and for a use case of inserting millions of small keys, it took 10 minutes as opposed to LevelDB taking a couple of seconds (probably due to write-ahead-log etc.). So BoltDB was a definite &quot;no&quot; for storing the Prometheus indexes.

    Specifically, the FCC’s “Net Neutrality” regulation 
    represents an Obama campaign promise fulfilled on behalf 
    of certain special interests, but ultimately a “solution” 
    in search of a problem. The government has now interjected 
    itself in how networks will be constructed and managed, 
    picked winners and losers in the marketplace, and 
    determined how consumers will receive access to tomorrow’s

Once the basics were understood, we&#x27;d start making basic apps on our own, often while still supporting more complex apps. After a year or two, we&#x27;d be competent enough to do things from scratch, and then we&#x27;d move into a full-time coding role.<p>I know that few people learn like this these days.

You can find techniques online and in his book New Complete Techniques. The CIA book is good, but a big gripe with the CIA book and the FCI/ICC book (Fundamental Techniques of Classic Cooking) is that the portions are pretty huge because they are for professional chefs and caterers. That aside, they are still a good resource for learning that. IIRC the James Peterson &quot;Cooking&quot; book is pretty good at basic techniques.<p>The Joy of Cooking is still one of my favorites, because the recipes are basic (but delicious), and because it&#x27;s a compendium of recipes, it builds on itself more than nearly every cookbook you can find.

8998938,comment,8996024,8998922,0,0,graycat,,,"Part III -- Statistics<p>For statistics, that is a messy field.  It
has too many introductory texts that over
simplify the subject and not enough well
done intermediate or advanced texts.<p>Also the subject has essentially a lie:
They explain that a random variable has a
distribution.  Right, it does.  Then they
mention some common distributions,
especially Gaussian, exponential, Poisson,
multinomial, and uniform.  Then the lie:
The suggestion is that in practice we
collect data and try to <i>find</i> the
distribution.  Nope:  Mostly not.  Mostly
in practice, we can&#x27;t find the
distribution, not even of one random
variable and much less likely for the
joint distribution of several random
variables (that is, of a vector valued
random variable).  Or, to estimate the
distribution of a vector valued random
variable commonly would encounter the
<i>curse of dimensionality</i> and require
really big <i>big data</i>.  Instead, usually
we use limit theorems, techniques that
don&#x27;t need the distribution, or in some
cases make, say, a Gaussian assumption and
get a first-cut approximation.<p>Early in my career I did a lot in applied
statistics but later concluded I&#x27;d done a
lot of slogging through a muddy swamp of
low grade material.<p>A clean and powerful first cut approach to
statistics is just via a good background
in probability:  With this approach, for
<i>statistics</i>, you take some data, regard
that as values of some <i>random variables</i>
with some useful properties, stuff the
data into some computations, and get out
data that you regard as the values of some
more <i>random variables</i> which are the
<i>statistics</i>.  The big deal is what
properties the output random variables
have -- maybe they are unbiased, minimum
variance, Gaussian, maximum likelihood,
estimates of something, etc.<p>For this work you will want to know the
classic limit theorems of probability
theory -- weak and strong laws of large
numbers, elementary and advanced
(Lindeberg-Feller) versions of the central
limit theorem, the law of the iterated
logarithm (and its astounding application
to an envelope of Brownian motion), and
martingales and the martingale convergence
theorem (&quot;the most powerful limit theorem
in mathematics&quot; -- it&#x27;s possible to have
making applications of that result much of
a successful academic career).  And,
generally beyond the elementary statistics
books, you will want to understand
<i>sufficient</i> statistics (and the
astounding fact that, for the Gaussian,
sample mean and variance are <i>sufficient</i>
with generalizations to the <i>exponential
family</i>) and, also, <i>U-statistics</i> where
the order of the input data makes no
difference (and <i>order statistics</i> are
always sufficient).  Sufficient statistics
is really from (a classic paper by Halmos
and Savage and) the Radon-Nikodym theorem
(with a famous, very clever, cute proof by
von Neumann), and that result is in, say,
the first half of W. Rudin, <i>Real and
Complex Analysis</i> (with von Neumann&#x27;s
proof).<p>Also with the Radon-Nikodym theorem, can
quickly do the Hahn decomposition and,
then, knock off a very general proof of
the Neyman-Pearson result in statistics.
How &#x27;bout that!<p>Thus, to some extent to do well with
statistics, both for now and for the
future, especially if you want to do some
work that is original, you will need much
of the rest of a good ugrad major in math
and the courses of a Master&#x27;s in selected
topics in pure/applied math.<p>So, for such study, sure, at one time
Harvard&#x27;s famous Math 55 used the Halmos
text above along with W. Rudin,
<i>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</i>
(calculus done very carefully and a good
foundation for more), and Spivak,
<i>Calculus on Manifolds</i>, e.g., for people
interested in more modern approaches to
relativity theory (but Cartan&#x27;s book is
available in English now).  It may be that
you are not interested in relativity
theory or the rest of mathematical physics
-- fine, and that can help you set aside
some topics.<p>Then, Royden, <i>Real Analysis</i> and the
first half of Rudin&#x27;s <i>R&CA</i> as above,
along with any of several alternatives,
cover measure theory and the beginnings of
functional analysis.  Measure theory does
calculus again and in a more powerful way
-- in freshman calculus, want to integrate
a continuous function defined on a closed
interval of finite length, but in measure
theory get much more generality.<p>And measure theory also provides the
axiomatic foundation for <i>modern</i>
probability theory and of <i>random
variables</i>.  Seeing that definition of a
random variable is a real eye opener, for
me a life-changing event:  Get a level of
understanding of <i>randomness</i> that cuts
out and tosses into the dumpster or bit
bucket nearly all the elementary and
popular (horribly confused) treatments of
<i>randomness</i>.<p><i>Functional analysis</i>?  Well, in linear
algebra you get comfortable with <i>vector
spaces</i>.  So, for positive integer n and
the set of real numbers R, you get happy
in the n-dimensional vector space R^n.
But, also be sure to see the axioms of a
vector space where R^n is just the leading
example.  You want the axioms right away
for, say, the (affine) vector subspace of
R^n that is the set of all solutions of a
system of linear equations.  How &#x27;bout
that!<p>Then in <i>functional analysis</i>, you work
with functions and where each function is
regarded as a <i>point</i> in a vector space.
The nicest such vector space is Hilbert
space which has an <i>inner product</i>
(essentially the same as angle or in
probability covariance and in statistics
correlation) and gives a <i>metric</i> in which
the space is <i>complete</i> -- that is, as in
the real numbers but not in the rationals,
a sequence that appears to converge really
has something to converge to.  Then wonder
of wonders (really, mostly due just to the
Minkowski inequality), the set of all real
valued random variables X such that the
expectation (measure theory integral)
E[X^2] is finite is a Hilbert space,
right, is complete.  Amazing, but true.<p>Then in Hilbert space, get to see how to
approximate one function by others.  So,
in particular, get to see how to
approximate a random variable don&#x27;t have
by ones you do have -- might call that
<i>statistical estimation</i> and would be
correct.<p>Then can drag out the Hahn-Banach result
and do projections, that is, least
squares, that is, in an important sense
(from a classic random variable
convergence result you should be sure to
learn), best possible linear
approximations.  And maybe such an
approximation is the ad targeting that
makes you the most money.<p>So, that projection is a baby version of
<i>regression analysis</i>.  There&#x27;s a problem
here:  The usual treatments of regression
analysis make a long list of assumptions
that look essentially impossible in
practice to verify or satisfy and, thus,
leave one with what look like unjustified
applications.<p>Nope:  Just do the derivations yourself
with fewer assumptions and get fewer
results but still often enough in
practice.  And they are still solid
results.<p>For the usual text derivations, by
assuming so much, they get much more,
especially lots of confidence intervals.
In practice often you can use those
confidence interval results as first-cut,
rough measures of <i>goodness of fit</i> or
some such.<p>But the idea of just a <i>projection</i> can
give you a lot.  In particular there is an
easy, sweetheart way around the onerous,
hideous, hated <i>over fitting</i> -- it seems
silly that having too much data hurts, and
it shouldn&#x27;t hurt and doesn&#x27;t have to!<p>And the now popular practice in <i>machine
learning</i> of just <i>fitting</i> with <i>learning
data</i> and then <i>verifying</i> with <i>test
data</i>, with some more considerations which
are also appropriate, can also be solid
with even fewer assumptions.<p>Go for it!",1423077071
8998937,comment,8998269,8998269,0,0,rcthompson,,,"When I was in college, one CS professor explained the difficulty of coding to me in terms of discreteness vs continuity. In the real world, things are continuous. If you accidentally build your structure with 9 supports instead of 10, then you only lose 10% of the strength of the structure, more or less. The strength varies continuously with the amount of support. But if you&#x27;re writing a 10-line program and you forget one of the lines (or even one character), the program isn&#x27;t 10% wrong, it&#x27;s 100% wrong. (For example, instead of compiling and running correctly, it doesn&#x27;t compile at all. Completely different results.)<p>Of course this logic doesn&#x27;t hold up all the time. Sometimes you can remove a critical support and collapse a structure, and sometimes removing a line of code has little to no effect, but the point is that in programming, a small change can have an unboundedly large effect, which is the definition of discontinuity.<p>(I believe it was this professor, who was my teacher for discrete math: <a href=""http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~jck/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~jck/</a> )",1423077061

to start with <i>abstract algebra</i>.  There
you will get <i>handy</i> with (relatively
simple versions of, and, thus, a good
place to start -- and, I have to say, put
you ahead of a surprisingly large fraction
of the best chaired professors of computer
science) theorems, proofs, sets, axioms,
groups (once I published a paper in
multi-variate, distribution-free
statistical hypothesis tests where the
core of the math used some group theory),
rings, fields, the integers, rationals,
reals, and complex numbers and their
leading properties, some important
algorithms, e.g., Euclidean greatest
common divisor (also the way to find
multiplicative inverses in the finite
field of the integers modulo a prime
number and, thus, the core of a super cute
way to do numerical matrix inversion
exactly using only short precision
arithmetic), number theory and prime
numbers (crucial in cryptography), vector
spaces (the core of multi-variate
statistics and more), and some of the
classic results.  Some of this material is
<i>finite mathematics</i> at times of high
interest in computing -- e.g., error
correcting coding.  For such a course, a
good teaching math department would be
good.  Have a good prof read and correct
your early efforts at writing proofs --
could help you a lot.<p>But starting with linear algebra is also
good.  There are lots of good books.  The
grand classic, best as a second text, is
P. Halmos, <i>Finite Dimensional Vector
Spaces</i>.  He wrote this in 1942 after he
had gotten his Ph.D. from J. Doob (long
the best guy in the US in stochastic
processes) and was an assistant to von
Neumann at the Institute for Advanced
Study (for much of the 20th century a good
candidate for the best mathematician in
the world).  The book is really a finite

course, in that picture they were working
up ways to save 1 million US casualties in
the Pacific in WWII and were astoundingly
successful.  Ulam is best known for the
Teller-Ulam configuration which in its
first test yielded an energy of 15 million
tons of TNT.  There are rumors that von

Carlo simulation, still important.<p>Other linear algebra authors include G.
Strang, E. Nering, Hoffman and Kunze, R.

    should receive recompense for their products (they 
    should), but whether legislation to protect that right 
    is aircover to perpetuate old practices at the expense 
    of new networks. There is no doubt there are honest-to-
    God Web pirates operating in China, Russia, and 
    elsewhere who are stealing copyrighted product. These 
    pirates should be stopped. But SOPA’s effort to 
    accomplish this – which also just happened to strengthen 
    the hand of content companies in other regards – applied 
    concepts more applicable to the command and control 
    networks of yesterday than to the open access networks 
    of today. 

    The power of the Internet is its lack of centralized 
    control. Its distributed architecture means the network 
    functions at the edge rather than at a central point.
    That edge activity, in turn, creates what the SOPA 
    supporters were trying to constrain: access they can’t
    control. While its goal of stopping piracy is laudable 
    and important, SOPA’s practical effect was to
    restructure through law the functionality of the

school?  Well, that’s not really for me.
Reading books at my own pace lets me try a
subject out without fully committing to it
and making it a necessity that I find work
based off of it.<p>I respond here in three parts, the first
general, the second more specific and
about linear algebra, and the third about
statistics.<p>Really, in school, you still have to learn
the stuff.  And, there a class might help
but won&#x27;t be enough; so, right, again,
during the course and in the hours not in
the class, you still have to study and
learn the stuff.  Or for the class,
&quot;mathematics is not a spectator sport&quot;.
That means you still have to <i>study</i> the
stuff, get it between your ears,
understand it.<p>Eventually you can conclude that mostly
college and its courses are more for
<i>certification</i> than education.  For the
<i>education</i>, that&#x27;s heavily up to you.<p>But there are some dangers in <i>self
learning</i>:  Not all the ideas and learning
materials are good; the really good ones
are only a small fraction of all the ones
you will likely encounter.<p>So, in praise of college and profs, they
can (1) get you on a good track with good
ideas and learning materials and (2) get
you unstuck and keep you on track.  In
such study, it&#x27;s possible to do too much
or too little -- from some experts you can
see about what is the right amount to do.<p>I said &quot;college&quot;; revise that to read &quot;one
of the world&#x27;s best research
universities&quot;, say, in the US, 1-2 dozen.
The ideas and materials you will see in
such a university really do stand to be
better than nearly all you will encounter
otherwise.  Such learning is where there&#x27;s
not much substitute for quality.  But,
still, just to learn the material, you
don&#x27;t really have to enroll in such a
university and, instead, just borrow from
their course descriptions and materials.
Indeed, some of the best such universities
are working hard to make their learning
materials available to all for free over
the Internet.  Why?  Because those
universities want to concentrate on
pushing forward with research.<p>Here&#x27;s a way:  Show up at such a
university and appropriate department, in
your case, applied math, mathematical
sciences, operations research, statistics,
whatever.  Maybe show up at some public
department seminars.  Talk with some of
the students.  Say you have a career
going, for your career are interested in
what the department is doing, and want to
learn more about the program and the
mathematical content.  So, get some of the
students to talk and explain.<p>Then for some of the courses you are
interested in, see who the profs are and
look at the course materials, say, texts,
handouts, on-line files, etc.<p>Then after looking at the materials and,
say, have made some progress with them,
try to get 15 minutes to chat with a prof.<p>Then take what you just got from that
department for free -- broad directions,
what they regard as more/less important,
texts, course materials, etc.  -- and go
off and study on your own.  When you think
that maybe you have some course studied
well, try to get a copy of the course
final exam or Ph.D. qualifying exam, work
through it, and, if it appears you did
well, ask a prof to check your solution to
a few of the most difficult questions.  If
your solutions look good, then you will
start to <i>look good</i> and may get asked if
you would like to apply as a student in
the department.  So, here you and the prof
and department are <i>interviewing</i> each
other.<p>Such things worked for me:  (A) In my
career I kept running into the work of
John Tukey at Princeton and Bell Labs.
So, it was stepwise regression,
exploratory data analysis, power spectral
estimation, convergence and uniformity in
topology, his statement equivalent to the
axiom of choice, etc.  So, I wrote him at
Princeton asking about graduate study,
mentioned those topics, and got back a
nice letter from the department Chair
basically inviting me to apply.<p>(B) I applied to Cornell and got rejected.
But largely independently I visited a prof
there to discuss optimization, asked about
being a grad student, and soon got another
letter accepting me to grad study.<p>(C) At least at one time, the Web site of
the Princeton math department said,
&quot;Graduate courses are introductions to
research by experts in their fields.  No
courses are given for preparation for the
qualifying exams.  Students are expected
to prepare for the qualifying exams on
their own.&quot; or some such.<p>Lesson:  In grad school at Princeton, are
still expected to learn the qualifying
exam materials on your own.  Well, to do
that, don&#x27;t have to be in the high rent
area around Princeton, NJ.<p>When I did go to grad school and got my
Ph.D., what really saved my tail feathers
was what I had done and did on my own as
independent study.  Some of the courses
helped in providing high quality
directions and materials, but the real
work was nearly all independent.<p>And, one of the crucial <i>inflection
points</i> was when I took a problem in a
course but not solved in the course, did
some <i>research</i>, and found a solution.
The solution was novel, and word spread
around the department quickly.  My <i>halo</i>
got a high polish, and that greatly eased
my path through my Ph.D.  That is, I had
proven results on the most important
research academic and Ph.D.  <i>bottom line</i>
-- I&#x27;d done good, novel, &quot;new, correct,
significant&quot; research.  Then my hair cut
or lack there of, sloppy hand writing,
occasional upchuck at some bad course
material, etc. no longer mattered.<p>My research looked publishable, and it was
-- I did publish it later, in one of the
best journals, easily, no revisions.  So,
lesson:  That <i>inflection point</i> was from
independent work.<p>So, don&#x27;t feel that your independent work
is inferior to enrolling as a student.
Instead, in the best universities, as a
student, nearly all the work is for you to
do independently anyway.<p>Still, I&#x27;d repeat -- try to <i>pick the
brains</i>, for free, without hurting your
present career, of the courses, profs, and
materials at a world class department in a
world class research university.<p>Why a <i>research university</i>?  World class
research is a very high bar and some of
the best evidence of good expertise,
insight, and judgment in the field -- and
you don&#x27;t want the opposites.",1423076715

The sounds of a language are among its least stable aspects.<p>Similarities in pronunciation between languages spoken over the same region are part of a phenomenon well known to linguists and do not imply that the languages are related. For example in terms of a pronunciation feature called coda devoicing, Slovene dialects near the Austrian border will pattern with German, those near the Croatian border will pattern with Croatian, while Standard Slovene will have something in the middle. Slovene and German are only very distantly related.<p>There may be something there about closely related population groups ending up using similar sounds even if their languages are not closely related, but I doubt the researchers even thought about that and used phonemic distance as a shorthand for actual linguistic distance.",1423076624

I can’t look like I have a wife and two-point-five kids and a mortgage,’ ” he told me.</i><p>> <i>Unsurprisingly, Matarasso has drawn several conclusions from this sociological experiment in miniature. First, the age at which people seek him out is dropping—Matarasso routinely turns away tech workers in their twenties. A few months ago, a 26-year-old came in seeking hair transplants to ward off his looming baldness. “I told him I wouldn’t let him. His hair pattern isn’t even established,” Matarasso said. The techies also place a premium on subtlety. “They’re not walking into their office in front of thirteen-year-old co-workers looking swollen and deformed. They’d rather go slow, do it gradually,” he told me. This helps explain why Fridays are his busiest days for tech-industry patients: They can recover over the weekend and show up Monday morning looking like an ever-so-slightly more youthful version of themselves, as though they’d resorted to nothing more invasive than a Napa getaway.</i><p>> <i>Matarasso told me that, in ascending order of popularity, the male techies favor laser treatments to clear up broken blood vessels and skin splotches. Next is a treatment called ultherapy—essentially an ultrasound that tightens the skin. “I’ve had it done of course. I was back at work the next day. There’s zero downtime.” But, as yet, there is no technology that trumps good old-fashioned toxins, the most common treatment for the men of tech. They will go in for a little Botox between the eyes and around the mouth. Like most overachievers, they are preoccupied with the jugular. “Men really like the neck,” Matarasso said, pointing out the spot in my own platysma muscle where he would inject some toxin to firm things up.</i>",1423076616

This provides consistent short-term gratification while also providing long-term gratification and utility.<p>For me, as an earth scientist, there have always been small calculations or simulations that are quite valuable, even though they are not overly difficult or complex. This provided the motivation to learn basic Matlab.  As my skills and ambition grew, and I learned new languages and techniques, the class of problems that I wanted to solve grew in scope and complexity. I also learned to recognize new problems and their probable solutions as my tools developed.  Programming changed the way I look at the earth, and at statistics, personal finance and a range of other things in which quantification is enlightening.<p>In contrast, I have had a hard time picking up new languages or programming paradigms when I don&#x27;t have an immediate need.  I&#x27;ve spent time mucking around on various &#x27;learn to code&#x27; websites, and read and sometimes completed tutorials on databases or Haskell or whatever, but it feels very different: meandering, non-essential, hard to gauge in scope (how much do I need to know to be useful, how deep is the water really), hard to link up to the rest of my life.  Programming for me is a powerful and enjoyable means to many ends, but not something that I am inclined to do for its own sake.<p>I think if I had said, &quot;I want to learn to program so I can build web apps&quot; without actually having a simple and truly useful web app that needed to be built, I would very quickly move on.  If I had said, &quot;I want to learn to program so I can find a new job that pays more money&quot; I would stick with it for a bit longer but it would be incredibly frustrating, because it doesn&#x27;t seem like there is a very straight path without formal guidance (such as going to school of some sort).<p>I suspect many people feel the same, but I don&#x27;t necessarily know how smaller, less formal education systems can work on that.

What better editors deserved the success it had that were available when TextMate was popular?</i><p>The fact that there wasn't another editor that fulfilled all those ""needs"" at the time (mainly: simple, native looking) does not mean that it deserved it's success. What I'm saying is, it got its success not because it was better than the competition but because there was no competition.<p>So, I just wish that something better was available at the time with the wanted features (mainly: simple to use and native looking). It would have been better for all in the long run.<p>><i>I've never understood when people say something or someone doesn't deserve something they've earned.</i><p>You can earn something for lots of reasons, not always the best of reasons. Nixon got the vote, doesn't mean he also deserved it.<p>><i>TextMate is successful because lots of people bought it. Who are you to judge what deserves to be successful and what doesn't, especially when history seems to disagree with you?</i><p>Actually history seems to agree with me.

I also bypassed many of the tools that locked those machines down and even locked the lab techs out of a few of my favorite machines that I used for long running processes. I even had my own primitive form of RDP using screen captures and email. Eventually I learned to crack the passwd file on my schools mainframe and then I had access to everyone's accounts including the teachers.

Somehow it worked like charm. Man was she hot! First hot girl I ever dated.<p>My downfall? I gave some ""goobers"" some irc scripts to perform netsplits and become admin of their favorite channels.

Germany might be able to go on relying on exports for ever.<p>The thing is, money can't really be created or destroyed, because it's just a marker for wealth. If country X is paying Germany money for its exports, that money is ""really"" a promise of future goods/labour from country X or someone they trade with; it only really works if it's ""redeemed"" from the same country in the end. If the trades were denominated in some scarce resource like gold, sooner or later all the gold would end up in Germany; likewise trading in euros within the eurozone.<p>(Obviously with fiat money if country X is paying in their own currency (let's say shillings) then they can continue to print more, but that devalues everyone's shillings (including the ones that have now made their way into German pension funds), German companies start charging more and more for their exports so the shilling inflates faster and faster and it all ends very badly for country X.)<p>((In reality, of course, neither of these extreme scenarios usually comes to pass. What would tend to happen is that as more of the international money supply is concentrated in Germany, other countries can't afford to pay as much for German exports, while Germany has more money available to spend on imports, and the market adjusts so imports and exports balance out))<p>>And a wise shopkeeper brings in more than they earn for decades, saving up for when their is no income (hard times or retirement).<p>True, but I think the analogy breaks down here. Thought if Germany were to ""go into retirement"" as a country the effects on the global financial system would be... interesting to say the least.",1344535345

Sometimes skeptical questioning comes across as negativity, I hope this wasn't the case.<p>A previous Elnode announcement was what made me actually want to look into Elisp more seriously, but I went straight into the Emacs Elisp manual, and found it rather low-level when it came to list construction. So I asked around:<p><pre><code>   http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4157512\n</code></pre>\n(incidentally, with ""not a real lisp"" I meant the admittedly narrow ""isn't the same thing at all"" in relation to Common Lisp or Scheme)<p>and gave up because I wasn't interested in Emacs-specific programs.<p>But I won't argue for or against that.

When artists were promised 15% royalties, cryptic ""breakage"" fees and other deductions brought that number closer to 5%, and forced the artist to incur costs such as tours, concerts and marketing, leaving the record labels only responsible to print records.",1344535322

Amazon did not force Unglue.it to suspend crowdfunding; it merely forced Unglue.it to stop using Amazon as the <i>backend</i> for their crowdfunding payment system.  Also, the license for the ebooks and the distribution model were irrelevant to Amazon's decision.  After all, Amazon sells/gives way plenty of CC'd books.<p>As other comments have noted, Amazon has decided as a matter of policy not to accept new crowdfunding customers until the legal and regulatory issues (i.e., money laundering, refunds, undelivered goods/failed projects, etc.) are worked out.<p>You can still use Paypal (takes a long time to get approved) or Stripe (you must set up your own backend).  Alternatively, you can go directly to a card processor (but you must then satisfy very stringent and expensive security requirements).",1344535273

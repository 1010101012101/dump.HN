People crash their vehicles into pedestrians or put psychoactive or harmful substances into the air without the consent of others or commit robbery for money to buy drugs. Alcohol and cigarettes belong in exactly the same category.<p>Blanket prohibitions just don&#x27;t work to prevent the harm. It only leads to the rise of organized crime. But permitting the substances while discouraging their use is quite effective -- as has been demonstrated in the recent past with the reduction in cigarette smoking in the US.<p>This is also why there is never any objection to caffeine. People drinking coffee has essentially zero capacity for harm to third parties.",1414393177

It was partly to discourage such slot-filling that BuzzFeed did not focus on its home page when it first started, he said.<p>In summation, buzzfeed has a commitment to only report current events, and the most interesting and thought provoking content.

8514196,comment,8513447,8514035,0,0,lazaroclapp,,,"I guess I was thinking about a unilateral intervention by a single country&#x27;s army. UN peacekeepers are a different thing altogether, both the scope of the mission and the goals are usually very different. I don&#x27;t have enough information to know how would that turn out. Keep in mind that they would be going into a very complex system that includes actors such as: the drug cartels, federal and state police, the Mexican army, federal and state political bodies, (multiple) self-defense civilian armies, (multiple) organized protest movements. The more official of those actors are - to an unknown degree - corrupted/infiltrated/colluded with the cartels. The more unstructured ones might very well consider peacekeeper intervention forcing them to disarm or stopping them from protest acts (which have included burning a state police building, an act that had surprising public support) to be further government repression.<p>In general I think just having independent media and investigators from outside the country can be helpful, since they can be perceived as not part of the system of internal corruption. I think it gets a lot more complicated when you have international <i>actors</i> as supposed to <i>observers</i> and/or <i>pressure</i>. Not saying it can&#x27;t work, but it is far from simple to predict... (there are, of course, people who know great many orders of magnitude more about the issues involved than I do, both within and without Mexico, so maybe someone is looking into whether or not that sort of intervention would help).",1414392064

A great teacher can <i>organize</i> information in such a way that it fits together logically. But an <i>average</i> teacher does neither of these things. They are giving you material you could learn better and faster by simply reading the book. So far as I could tell, in most of my classes through grade school and high school the only reason for lecturing is that some kids can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t read the book, so the teacher needs to say out loud the exact same things that the textbook author said better in print.<p>When choosing a textbook, you can use one written by one of the best subject-domain teachers <i>in the entire country</i> and that author has an <i>editor</i> whose job is to hone the material to minimize repetition and confusion. What&#x27;s more, you&#x27;re not even constrained to <i>currently living</i> textbook author/editor combinations. If the best treatment on the subject was written in 1947, schools can still use that 1947 textbook (or relevant quoted sections from it). But when choosing a teacher you need to find somebody who is alive and teaching <i>today</i> and <i>lives in or is willing to relocate to your neighborhood</i>, which hugely lowers the expected quality. Your math teacher might be quite good compared to most math teachers in your county but probably is <i>not</i> a world-renowned subject expert the way your textbook author is. Your teacher has no editor tightening up the prose. Your teacher&#x27;s lectures are (compared to the book) rambling, poorly organized and repetitive.<p>As a result, the best learning strategy to get at least <i>some</i> value out of the time you&#x27;re forced to spend sitting in a class being talked at by idiots is to read the textbook and ignore lectures - use that time to read books or magazines that you actually enjoy.",1414391872

Every driver is identified and known, and Uber has a lot of incentive to weed out bad drivers, especially when they are just starting the service and couple of bad reviews can kill adoption for a whole market. What incentive Uber has to support bad service? I can tell one incentive for city politicians to do it - taxi lobbyists pay into their campaign funds, and you do not (at least not as much, unless you are Zuckerberg, in which case you probably have your own limo anyway), so who has more influence on them?<p>>>> For similar reasons, I&#x27;m also pretty sure the insurance situation is solid.<p>Because Uber just dreams about uninsured million-dollar lawsuit. Nothing inspires investors to invest into a young business as much as an uninsured risk of a million-dollar lawsuits, right? And Uber doesn&#x27;t care about investors or risks - unlike city politicians whose very future is linked to the fact whether city would be sued or not, since lawsuit cost comes out of their pockets... Oh wait, I got it in reverse - city politician could not care less if the city is sued since taxpayers would pay it anyway, while Uber guys risk their own money and their investors money. Yet somehow you trust more the guy who uses your money to insure your risks and has zero incentive to preserve it and large incentive to follow lobby interests over guy who uses their own money and has large incentive to preserve it. I wonder how it works out for you.<p>>>> But in my view, Uber&#x27;s cure is worse than the disease.<p>Worse in what? Of course, if you refuse to trust anything that does not say &quot;State Commission&quot; and is not rules by an unaccountable bureaucrat, then every cure would be worse than the disease for you.

While Firefox OS probably won&#x27;t make a dent in ChromeOS or iOS market share, the paradigm of developing mobile/desktop apps using web technologies probably will expand. It&#x27;s hard to argue with tech that allows building run-anywhere applications.<p>Performance of browsers will continue to approach desktop native performance, further allowing more applications, including some that are currently impossible in-browser, like good 3D games. Native games will be among the last types of app to go browser, but they will come along, as well. The browser VM is pretty good and getting better. Unity has already shown that a lot of games can be built in a VM language and environment (and while Mono/C# is currently faster than JavaScript for some things, and has more native access, that likely won&#x27;t be forever, and increasing machine performance will likely close whatever gap remains).<p>Assume everything will be more powerful, and things that are just out of reach today because of memory, or CPU speed, or disk space, will become mundane in a few years.

So, when someone says you&#x27;ll never make a great 3D game on a table running in the browser, you should assume that really means, &quot;you won&#x27;t make a great 3D game on a tablet in a browser <i>today</i>&quot;.<p>Network speed will be a continuing source of revolutionary change. Fiber is making its way slowly, but surely, into the home. That kind of speed changes <i>everything</i> about how you interact, just like broadband brought us YouTube, GMail, Netflix streaming, streaming every kind of media, etc. fiber will make it seem entirely normal for every file to be stored in the cloud. We&#x27;re nervous about that, as nerds who understand the privacy implications, but it&#x27;ll happen, whether we trust it or not. Just like facebook continues to happen, despite our misgivings about what a privacy nightmare it is. So, building good encrypted ways to use that incredible network will be an ethical and profitable way to predict and create the future. (Building un-encrypted ways to use that network will be evil, but profitable.)",1414391581

Furthermore, as many elections are competitive, these changes could affect electoral outcomes. For example, in the 2000 US presidential election, George Bush beat Al Gore in Florida by 537 votes (less than 0.01% of votes cast in Florida). Had Gore won Florida, he would have won the election&quot;<p>&quot;To put these results in context, it is important to note that turnout has been steadily increasing in recent US midterm elections, from 36.3% of the voting age population in 2002 to 37.2% in 2006, and to 37.8% in 2010. Our results suggest that the Facebook social message increased turnout directly by about 60,000 voters and indirectly through social contagion by another 280,000 voters, for a total of 340,000 additional votes. That represents about 0.14% of the voting age population of about 236 million in 2010. However, this estimate does not include the effect of the treatment on Facebook users who were registered to vote but who we could not match because of nicknames, typographical errors, and so on. It would be complex to estimate the number of users on Facebook who are in the voter record but unmatchable, and it is not clear whether treatment effects would be of the same magnitude for these individuals, so we restrict our estimate to the matched group that we were able to sample and observe. This means it is possible that more of the 0.60% growth in turnout between 2006 and 2010 might have been caused by a single message on Facebook.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s important to note that 0.14% of the population is the small number. It was 0.6% of the mobilized voting population and they got these results messaging 1/6 of the population. Furthermore they only report on effects that they could track and so all numbers are lower bounds.",1414391067

Not that I disagree with you. But it&#x27;s not a reasonable strategy.<p>> I would also like to point out that legalizing drugs would not solve the problem. The problem is corruption, not the drugs themselves. Look at Miami in the 1970s. It was a war zone, just like Mexico is today. The reason is because you could buy off any cop or government official in the city (check out the documentary &quot;Cocaine Cowboys&quot; for some real news footage from the time).<p>> If drugs are legalized tomorrow, what do you think would happen? If I were the cartels, I would continue selling my product, this time legal (similar to how companies are outsourcing to China..drug companies will outsource to Mexico). My power would continue or increase, because I could just buy off any cop and/or government official and the violence would continue (ruling by fear).<p>Can you explain why no cartels have stopped producing illegal drugs, and started producing, say, quinoa, corn, and wheat instead? If legalization would have no effect on their profits, why do they choose to specialize in illegal markets like drugs and gun-running?<p>Look, after legalization, cartels would suddenly face a huge amount of competition from companies that <i>don&#x27;t burn large amounts of cash fighting wars</i>, which are generally quite expensive. Ordinary agricultural production is not generally associated with beheadings, torture, and assassinations. This is not because producers of quinoa are inherently virtuous, but because the incentives faced by black market &quot;companies&quot; are extremely atypical.<p>> Please..just stop the fucking dishonesty and I might support your cause.<p>I agree that the legalization of MMJ was to some extent a dishonest attempt to get de facto legalization (successfully, I might add). But it is entirely irrational to base your support for a policy on the actions of some proponents of that policy.",1414390285

8514126,comment,8513447,8514066,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> You do realize that the Drug Cartels are committing crimes far far worse than tax evasion, right? And there have been no repercussions for them. By suddenly charging them with tax evasion, do you think they&#x27;ll be stopped?<p>Let&#x27;s try to explain this with math. Suppose X amount of drugs has a market price of $100 and of that, $20 is the actual production cost and $80 is the amortized cost of law enforcement occasionally arresting you and seizing your drugs (and the various measures to attempt to prevent that).<p>Tomorrow we legalize drugs and impose a $60 tax. Joe Farmer in Iowa plants a field full of marijuana and starts selling it for $85 after taxes, keeping a $5 profit after the $20 cost and $60 tax. The drug cartel now has to hit an $85 price point to compete but they need to charge $100 to justify the costs of breaking the law, so they&#x27;re out of business.",1414390134

Case-in-point: IE6. IE6 is still with us today, as much as we hate it. You can make all the arguments for a modern browser that you want, but businesses and a few people say, ""But I like it better.""<p>Are there easy code migrations to MongoDB? No! Are there easy query migrations? Not really. It isn't a linear transition from one to the other. So no only do you have to rewrite your software, but you've got to pitch your SQL references out the window along with your queries.<p>I believe that Postgres will replace MySQL. It's mature, SQL-based and similar enough that only <i>tweaks</i> are needed to get a code base running.

It's also easy to get started as you can start with any text editor, a browser and there is no compiling or development environment to configure (a huge obstacle I think other programs forget btw - setting up and getting your IDE working is not so simply for a beginner).<p>From Javascript you can use your knowledge and move to just about any other langauge (C/C++, Java, C#, Actionscript are examples of other 'C' derived languages). Plus, Javascript's popularity is on the rise and it's a good skill for any programmer to have in his toolbelt (you are bound to run into it at some point in your programming experience down the road).<p>As far as putting programming skills to practice, I agree with the sentiment of others - come up with a pet project, even a simply one to learn the ropes. For example I use to always start by writing a simple contact/address book program; it contain all the elements you'd need to know for most business apps (a list of records (addresses), the ability to view 'details', add new records, delete records and edit existing data).<p>You should also consider taking a computer programming class at your local community college.

I don't think you understand what I meant.  I meant if a URL is too long to fit within a block of text in your medium, enable hyperlinking it with short, descriptive link text the way just about any media <i>other</i> than twitter or plain text (or HN markdown, but I digress) allows.  Have we already regressed from the concept of the well-made hyperlink?<p>I appreciate that designing URL structure for a site can be difficult.  I don't think it's as hard as you make it out to be, because just about any free CMS package will take care of SEO'd URLs for you and set up redirects even if you change your content.  Hell, you can customize all of this in Wordpress without touching code.  But that's an orthogonal problem, and shortened URLs neither contribute to SEO nor constitute a viable long-term URL structure for any site.<p>> Short urls are valuable because they allow people an ability to simplify the increasingly long urls for use in many different mediums without the worry of breaking or losing portions of the url.<p>This is what I don't understand.  OK, sure, URLs get long, but they could be long before we started putting keywords in them, that's not new.  Besides email or twitter, what media are you possibly talking about where I'm dropping bits of a URL on the floor?  And if bad email clients can't linkify long URLs properly and twitter won't allow proper link formatting, why are we just rolling over and enabling their problems?<p>>Twitters 140 characters is part of what defines them. There will always be short message mediums, ...<p>They could and should make an exception for URLs.  Imagine tweeting:<p><pre><code>    URL shortener controversy all over again!
    [Read it on HN|http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2734728]
</code></pre>
and the URL portion and formatting doesn't count toward the limit, only the link text part.  Visually, that's only 55 characters worth of information, and that's how the limit should be formulated.  You can't tell me that <a href=""http://bit.ly/blsa23848"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/blsa23848</a> is more informative or contributes meaningfully to Twitter's character limit by virtue of it being shorter than my formatted link <i>with link text</i>.

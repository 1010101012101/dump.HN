The penalty is twofold.  First, the need to encrypt the data requires that the CPU have access to it.  Even discounting the costs of computation, the need to touch the data removes a lot of benefits of sendfile / splice / etc.   There is an interesting Netflix paper about this: <a href=""https://people.freebsd.org/~rrs/asiabsd_2015_tls.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://people.freebsd.org/~rrs/asiabsd_2015_tls.pdf</a><p>Due to the nature of SSL, applying hardware offload solutions is problematic.  The most efficient hardware offload would be a PCIe card that does encryption AND TCP offload.  But then you&#x27;re dealing with TCP offload, which is seldom a good idea.    If you use an encyption-only hardware solution like the Intel QuickAssist cards, then you wind up in danger of running out of PCIe lanes.  Eg, to serve at 100Gb/s per CPU socket, you need 16 PCIe Gen3 lanes for network, 16 PCIe Gen3 lanes for storage, and 16 PCIe Gen3 lanes for Quick Assist.  So you&#x27;re up to 48 lanes, but a Xeon e5-xxx v3 CPU has a max of 40 lanes.",1454281075

And at least in the case of C/C++ it&#x27;ll also likely use several times more RAM. Now for a company like Uber it may not matter if something is 3x slower and uses 3x the RAM, just throw more hardware at the problem, but if you&#x27;re going to introduce typing into Python, you might as well go with a language where typing is not optional, and which, more importantly, has been used in production by thousands of teams over the past decade or more. Of the languages I listed, only C++ is not really viable for most programmers.<p>As to caring about perf, you shouldn&#x27;t care about it until you have to. Take that 2h vs 20min example, for instance. If you only need to run it a few times and there&#x27;s plenty of time available, who cares how long it takes. If the 2h one is easier to write that&#x27;s by all means what you should do. OTOH if you&#x27;re under severe time constraints and need to run it every hour, then obviously 2h script won&#x27;t do the job. Or alternatively if 20 min script takes the same time to write as 2h one, then of course you should go with it. All too often I see people optimizing things that don&#x27;t matter one iota, simply because they like things to be fast. Something gets executed once a day and runs for 5 minutes? Let&#x27;s spend two weeks making it complete in 30 seconds. As long as the employer is paying, why not.",1454281016

I have no major complaints about the language or about Tk (I&#x27;ve also built some trinkets with Python+Tk and Perl+Tk over the years). But...that ship has sailed, about 15 years ago.<p>And, I can&#x27;t argue with the &quot;JavaScript burnout&quot; problem. I&#x27;m currently trying to sort out the front end for our UI rewrite, considering things like React. There&#x27;s an incredible wordsoup of jargon and new tools to learn, no established best practices (we&#x27;re in the wild west phase of web UI development, with a thousand competing and occasionally interacting technologies), and no unified way to build a user interface in HTML+JavaScript.<p>I mean, I can understand someone looking at how bloody simple it is to put a window with a widget on the screen with Tcl/Tk (or almost any other reasonable UI toolkit, for that matter), vs. the huge pile of crud one has to install and poke at to do the same for a browser in a modern way (i.e. without reloading the page every time something changes state, for example), and throwing their hands in the air and saying, &quot;Fuck this! I&#x27;m going back to...whatever I was using before.&quot; Things have gotten so baroque in the web development space, it can seem impossible to look at a new project and have any clue what&#x27;s going on (because you have to know all of the frameworks and libraries and transpilers it uses, the tooling it uses like Webpack, SASS/LESS, etc., plus the basics of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript).<p>And, obviously, I can&#x27;t tell anyone not to give up on the web and build traditional desktop applications. But, if you want your software to be <i>used</i> by real people, it&#x27;s almost always going to need to be on the web. And, that will become more true over time, rather than less true.<p>I find desktop apps charming, but even my stubbornness has run its course. I haven&#x27;t started seriously using a new desktop application in maybe five years (Mixxx DJ software is the most recent thing I can think of). Even for things that a desktop app ought to do better...like email, there are now better web applications for the task, and I find myself using the web more than the desktop programs for almost everything.",1454280861

11008553,comment,11008046,11008046,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"TCL/TK wasn&#x27;t an especially pleasant toolkit for users or developers, although compared to the HTML5 stack building a house out of matchsticks will seem convenient and pleasant. There were much better toolkits even back then: Delphi&#x27;s component library was my favourite.<p>IMHO the web is one of the biggest downgrades to app development that has ever happened, in so many ways. And what&#x27;s really sad is that so many developers joined the industry since around 2000 that it feels like the majority of programmers have never written anything <i>but</i> web apps, they literally have never used a professional, well designed UI toolkit! The closest many people have got to that is doing mobile development.<p>One project I occasionally daydream about doing (if/when I get spare time again), is trying again to make Java applets work, with the following fairly major changes:<p>1) No browser dependencies beyond a URL handler. The &#x27;app browser&#x27; would register some sort of app:// URL handler and that&#x27;s the only way to invoke apps from the browser.<p>2) Core app browser uses the same auto-update tech as Chrome. Silent, invisible, in the background, continuous.<p>3) Old cruft like AWT that exposes huge amounts of native code (i.e. exploitable code) would be removed. Sooooo many Java exploits boiled down to exploiting native libraries shipped along side the JVM, but these days you can do most stuff without needing support from C/C++ libraries.<p>4) App code is compressed, reordered to be streamable and then app servers stream everything via HTTP/2 with server push. The average web page is now 2mb in size so with some careful design you could make apps written in this way start faster than actual web apps can, especially as you&#x27;d remove a lot of overhead that&#x27;s useful for documents but not so much for apps.<p>5) Apps would also update themselves in the same way as Chrome does. You could mark apps as &quot;check for update on every launch&quot; but if you don&#x27;t, apps will start even when offline.<p>6) There&#x27;d be a universal, reference app server that accepts sandboxed app uploads and provides access to a few useful services like a Postgres. By default it&#x27;d let anyone upload any app to any server. Again, the server would update in exactly the same way as Chrome (no apt-get required).<p>7) Things like CSS would be replaced by type safe DSLs that compile down to bytecode.<p>There are a bunch of other improvements I&#x27;d like to put into my ideal app platform, but I can&#x27;t list them all here.<p>The above might sound completely crazy given Java&#x27;s track record of exploits, but you have to consider a few things.<p>One is that HotSpot got a LOT more secure in recent years due to heavy investment in security. When the last zero day was discovered (a bug in a Microsoft DLL shipped for AWT), over two and a half years had passed between that and the previous zero day. Java has reached the same point that browsers have: the security bugs are almost all being discovered by whitehats. Unfortunately browser makers had decided to kill off applets entirely by this point and users had learned to hate them, partly because of the obnoxious update process on Windows (Ask Toolbars and such). But the underlying core tech isn&#x27;t actually that bad anymore. Compare the list of CVEs between HotSpot and Firefox and it doesn&#x27;t look so different.<p>Another reason for Java&#x27;s poor reputation is that it historically exposed far more functionality to applets than HTML did to web pages. But the HTML5 effort has been changing this and by now, the modern web platform exposes a vast and rapidly increasing surface area to web pages. Massive new chunks of functionality like video chat or OpenGL can appear almost overnight, it seems. But all of this stuff is implemented in C++ and suffers the usual litany of bugs associated with that language. Whereas the trend in the Java world has been the opposite: new functionality is often mostly or entirely implemented in Java itself, and so cannot be buffer-overflowed or double-freed.<p>Finally, the Java team are still making major architectural improvements that should reduce security holes even further, in particular, the Jigsaw effort supposedly would have avoided about a third of all the security bugs in Java in recent years.<p>Given that any large app platform that supports mobile code will have security bugs, I feel it&#x27;s really more about how you manage them than a simple &quot;web rocks, java sucks&quot; world view. And the advantage of using a platform actually designed for apps instead of documents should be obvious.",1454280718

Silicon Valley startups are, more often than not, essentially looking to exploit you in order to maintain a hypergrowth graph that ends up in a place where you don’t matter by definition.<p>That has always been my feeling too. The key word is commitment. The company can be big but it depends on how committed they are to their services. For example, I can commit myself to the .NET Framework of Microsoft because I know that they won&#x27;t be dropping it anytime soon, it is  pivotal for them and tighly coupled to their strategy.<p>Also some companies have a reputation for shutting down their services or having unstable APIs.

And I had this sense long before the Parse thing.<p>My preference is to work with big companies having &quot;obvious&quot; commitments like Microsoft and .NET.<p>When I&#x27;m not sure of this commitment, if I have the opportunity to work with a small company that has a great product and I know is not seeking explosive growth, this is a no brainer for me.<p>This is one of the reasons why I stopped to define myself as a startup. I asked myself, if I was one my leads would I actually buy my products ? And I figured that the term startup tends to be associated with a quest for big acquisitions or explosive growth, while talking about a company conveys a sense of stability. I&#x27;d commit myself in Learning a Framework or integrating an API only if I know the company is serious about supporting the product for the next 10 to 20 years.",1454280524

The better companies are at least <i>aware</i> that this is going on, and can use it to their advantage when it suits them or counteract it when it doesn&#x27;t.<p>The thing is - if you zoom out, &quot;experience&quot; is nothing more than overspecialization in the particular environment you found yourself.  That applies at the industry, society, evolutionary, and planetary levels as well.  Organisms adapt to the particular circumstances that they live in.  <i>Usually</i> these adaptations are beneficial, because otherwise they get pruned out and people adopt different ways of doing things.  But sometimes the environment changes in a way that makes all that accumulated knowledge irrelevant, and you end up like the dinosaurs.  Extinct.<p>I&#x27;ve found that most of the time, people&#x27;s knowledge is the product of hard-won experience, and if you tear it down, you will encounter the same problems that led to them coming to those conclusions in the first place.  But occasionally, something changes in the environment, and you <i>need</i> to tear things down to adapt.  If you want to build off existing knowledge, become an employee, and join a company that&#x27;s busy figuring out all the corollaries of the premise that founded it.  If you want to challenge existing premises, become a founder, and look for areas where the environment has changed in a way that invalidates existing knowledge.<p>If you try to build something totally new and different by learning all the existing ways people have built stuff, you will probably fail (believe me, I&#x27;ve tried several times).  Similarly, if you join an organization hoping to tear down all the wisdom they&#x27;ve accumulated and replace it with an outsider&#x27;s perspective, you will probably meet significant resistance.

The ability to create/edit projects with either will help you a lot.<p>3 - Raise you price to at least $99. Any professional freelancer or design company will not think twice about this price point and can see it saves a lot more than this in time on just the first project. I think you should be aiming at professionals and not hobbyists. Odd though it sounds, the less people pay the more they complain about a product and the more demanding the support they ask for. Trust me, you could offer this for $10 and someone will still complain that your 100&#x27;s of hours of hard work is worth only $5.<p>4 - Always specify a time limit of a special offer. This creates a sense of urgency and is the reason that offers work. Mention on your site when the offer expires, otherwise people don&#x27;t know and so they will wait. Then they will miss the deadline and are either upset decide not to buy because they wanted the cheaper price.<p>5 - If you have a roadmap of additions then mention some of the changes to be released in the next year.

Less cost cutting, less profit, but a more sensible workload.<p>No in the sense that the prices to the customer aren&#x27;t coming down to cost-price. The reason for this is that we deliver ridiculous value (i.e., with $250k of annual legal work, which is puny, you can generate millions in cost savings). You&#x27;d think then, that competing business would quickly arise and drive prices down, but the industry is so cyclical (and doomed to die as lots of things get automated etc), that it&#x27;s not a great industry for new entrants to compete with the incumbents (which have consolidated with lots of mergers the past 20 years become quite massive firms with strong brand names that drive tons of inbound leads, besides if you&#x27;re a small new entrant you tend to get bought out anyway)<p>Hell these firms are all in private hands and have been for a long time, the shareholders appoint a board to squeeze as much profit... which is why I concur with the OP, a lot of the business is driven by cheap juniors under the guise of a strong brand name, where senior staff spend the majority of their time on sales rather than actual work, and are called &#x27;vice presidents&#x27; for that reason.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s not all that crazy.

Main impact is on email marketing.&quot;</i><p>Sounds like a feature, not a bug.<p>The US &quot;Safe Harbor&quot; was always a joke.  It was a work-around because the US refuses to enact data protection laws that give Internet users strong rights against businesses.<p>Read the EU Data Protection Directive.[1]  EU citizens have have the right to demand some things of the &quot;data controller&quot; who collected data about you. They can demand a copy of the data. They can demand corrections. They can demand to know of any other parties possessing copies of the data. They can demand to know what other parties are doing with it. These rights cannot be waived. &quot;Data controllers&quot; have to register with their country&#x27;s data protection authority, and list what data they are keeping about individuals. Individuals can complain to the data protection authority if there are violations; they don&#x27;t have to sue.<p>Consent must be explicit. An EULA is not enough. &quot;Every consent must be given \nin an unambiguous way. This means that there should be no reasonable doubt that \nthe data subject wanted to communicate his or her agreement to allow processing \nof his or her data. Deducing consent from mere inactivity is not capable of delivering unambiguous consent, for example. Where data to be processed are sensitive, explicit consent is mandatory and must be unambiguous.&quot;<p>An individual&#x27;s consent to share personal data can be withdrawn at any time.  &quot;Example: A customer agrees to receive promotional mail to an address he or she provides to a data controller. Should the customer withdraw consent, the controller must immediately stop sending promotional mail. No punitive consequences such as fees should be imposed. If the customer was receiving a 5% reduction on the cost of a hotel room in return for agreeing to the use of his or her data for promotional mail, the withdrawal of consent to receiving promotional mail at a later stage should not result in having to pay back those reductions.&quot;[2]<p>Incidentally, this applies only to &quot;natural persons&quot;, not corporations or businesses. Businesses come under the European Directive on Electronic Commerce, which requires disclosure, not privacy.<p>Since the entire EU has been under these rules for over twenty years now, this is not impossible. But it&#x27;s something US companies now have to get used to.<p>It&#x27;s not a problem for companies which collect customer data for internal use only. It&#x27;s a big problem for companies which sell that data.  That data isn&#x27;t theirs to sell under EU law.  The individual has ownership of their own data.<p>[1] <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:319...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2014-handbook-data-protection-law-2nd-ed_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2014-handbook-d...</a>",1454277981

You could be easily reading at 1GB+/sec and pushing 10-20Gbps to NICs, depending on the hardware.",1454277712

They make a different set of tradeoffs to Western nations - harsh law enforcement to achieve low crime rates, etc. I&#x27;ve lived in China, which <i>does</i> have a shitty government, but even China&#x27;s problems are exaggerated in Western media.<p>The only things on that list I have a real problem with are freedom of speech and LGBT rights. Capital punishment and caning shock Westerners, but Singapore&#x27;s legal system is actually fair and efficient; it&#x27;s not like the procedural trainwreck which is the US justice system where countless criminals walk free and countless law-abiding citizens are rotting in jail.<p>Conscription is pretty much necessary for a micro-state sandwiched between two nations which historically hated their guts. Migrant workers aren&#x27;t forced to be there (and unlike Qatar or Dubai, they&#x27;re not generally lured in under false pretences). Even the freedom of expression rules are very similar to the de-facto/de-jure hate speech rules which exist in the West, and they exist for a similar reason - Singapore wants to minimise Chinese/Malay tensions.<p>EDIT: I just remembered that this HN user -  <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=frenchieinsg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=frenchieinsg</a> - initially piqued my interest in Singapore.

The refined version of this proposal, known as the two round (2R) hypothesis, assumes that the genome of jawed vertebrates has been shaped by two rounds of whole genome duplication that took place after the emergence of urochordates and before the radiation of jawed vertebrates. \n[...]\nOf special interest in this connection is the proposal of Olinski et al. [ 45••] that the four sets of MHC paralogons and the four sets of neurotrophin paralogons were derived from a single contiguous region on an invertebrate proto-chromosome (Figure 2). Interestingly, two of the neurotrophin paralogons [46] are located on 12p11–p13 and 19q13–q14 that encode the NKC and LRC, respectively.&quot;\n<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17707623"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17707623</a>",1454277606

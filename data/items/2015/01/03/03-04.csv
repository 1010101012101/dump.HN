8829867,comment,8827949,8827949,0,0,Gatsky,,,"I was quite surprised to find this in one of the most prestigious journals in the world. Vogelstein is one of the biggest names in cancer research, and no doubt that was the most important factor in its publication.<p>Some problems:\n1. They leave out breast cancer and prostate cancer, two of the most common cancers out there. Most of the dots on their plot relate to a tiny proportion of cancers that people get. Furthermore, breast cancer has a very low mutation rate, which also casts doubt on their hypothesis about accummulation of somatic mutations on stem cells.<p>2. I ran their data using just the number of stem cells and the number of cells versus incidence. The correlations are still good, about 0.5 for just cell mass and 0.67 for number of stem cells. It&#x27;s hardly a revelation that a larger more cellular organ is more likely to get cancer.<p>3. For glioblastoma, a type of brain tumour, their data says that there are 0 stem cell divisions, because it is thought there is no cell renewal in the brain (which isn&#x27;t even true, but anyway). This contradicts the whole hypothesis, but they still include it in there.<p>4. The lifetime incidence of various cancers is age dependent. For example sarcomas almost always occur in the young, medulloblastoma is vanishingly rare in the elderly, testicular cancer occurs in young men. Their hypothesis ignores all this, because their model only allows for the acquisition of mutations over time, which should give a unimodal relationship between age and cancer incidence.<p>5. There are cancers that have almost no mutations. Gene copy number changes are just as important if not more so than mutations. There is very little evidence that copy number changes accumulate over time in stem cells in a random fashion required by this model.<p>I don&#x27;t think this warrants much attention in the end. This can join the 100,000 other unverified (or unverifiable correlations) in the cancer literature.",1420256989

8829861,comment,8828250,8829315,0,0,meowface,,,"Well, problem is those vulns require either the attacker to share or control the victim&#x27;s LAN in some way, or the router&#x27;s management panel to be exposed to the Internet (which is usually not the default for the vast majority of consumer routers).<p>For cases where they&#x27;re remotely exposed, just about anyone can scan the Internet and try to exploit these routers. I&#x27;m sure he was doing that, but I&#x27;m sure hundreds or thousands of other people were as well.<p>When combined with something like a CSRF, you can use those exploits against a victim even if their router is locked down (only listening on LAN, strong admin password). All they need to do is visit a site you control, without something like NoScript. If the admin password is not guessable, then they&#x27;d need to have an active login session. That can be circumvented if the router has an auth bypass vuln, which has been found in at least a few models.<p>Also, I believe a lot of routers can be used for DDoSing without exploiting or compromising them at all if they&#x27;re exposing SSDP (UPnP). SSDP reflection, possibly combined with NTP reflection, is likely how Lizard Squad launched their DDoS attacks.<p>P.S.

8829855,comment,8828543,8829176,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"SSH is designed to serve a single service on a single host. It distributes its host key on the first connection and caches it indefinitely, assuming it will never change. SSH is designed with a limited set of protocol features, and everything else is kind of hacked on top of proprietary client/server pairs. SSH is designed as a loose encrypted session (kind of like a pipe) for an application on a host.<p>TLS is designed to serve multiple services on multiple hosts. It depends on your browser trusting an intermediary host which validates the host key, so (in theory) the initial connection can&#x27;t be MITM&#x27;d, and so the key can change at any time or there can be multiple keys (which is needed for hosting multiple services on multiple hosts). TLS is designed to integrate tightly into an application.<p>When you compare the two protocols, TLS is clearly superior to SSH. But in terms of the features they support (tunneling, authentication, etc), it&#x27;s up to the server to add missing features outside of the protocol to provide for what the client wants to do.<p>For example, the SSH protocol basically provides an encrypted connection through which you can do whatever you want, similar to TLS. To do IP tunneling with SSH the application server activates extra functionality to connect the encrypted session to a driver which opens an IP tunnel. Or to authenticate your ssh session against a kerberos server, the ssh server does the actual kerberos authentication; the protocol just informs the client of what &#x27;basic&#x27; methods they can use, and the client tries to use one that works with the server&#x27;s methods.<p>Incidentally, TLS the protocol supports client certificate authentication, which provides similar functionality to SSH&#x27;s public keys. The HTTP protocol also does certificate pinning.",1420256603

After a very short amount of time, North Korea would be entirely incapable of shooting down high altitude bombers, the US would never have to put boots on the ground, just spend all the money on never-ending bombing raids.<p>It goes back to what I said: the issue is what the US would be willing to do to win. It&#x27;s not acceptable to defeat enemies today in a manner in which truly large sums of civilians are killed (I&#x27;m talking about killing 1/4, 1/2 of the country, vaporizing them, mowing them down with unrelenting bombardment, and then with starvation).<p>The US could have easily won the Vietnam war, it won every major engagement. The US could have marched north with a million soldiers and run over the Vietcong, killing however many people were necessary in the process. However it would have required another level of extreme brutality, and potentially (likely?) would have ended in a direct war with Russia or China. The question for the US post WW2 has been what&#x27;s acceptable to achieve victory in war, because against its adversaries that question has been the only limiting factor, not the ability to achieve victory itself.<p>As a side note, I consider that the US won the Korean war.

And despite the good intentions of some people I have know, barely pay attention to the community neither apply real steps to push harder.<p>For example, I win one of the contest for tech startups among more than 1000 (or 2000? I don&#x27;t remember) and the prize was US 2.000 aprox (with absurd restrictions: I only can use it for buy presentation cards, brochures and similars!

The kernel keeps track of free space automatically. Don&#x27;t worry about it.&quot; And, generally, it worked pretty well. (Source: I like to fill disks. I&#x27;ve never seen a big slowdown even unto the point of &quot;no space left on medium&quot; errors.)<p>So why does ZFS, a Thoroughly Modern Filesystem by any account, need defragging?",1420256293

Everything in my comment was meant to be compatible with (to take one example) the possibility that some particular well-defined refinement of string theory turns out to be the ultimate theory of nature, and only variations in local conditions are unpredictable. (This is meant in much the same way that the well established laws of gravitation, electromagnetism, and nuclear physics will give rise to very diverse solar systems.)<p>There <i>are</i> interesting questions in many multiverse models about the history and origin of the universe, and I&#x27;ve seen people express concerns about the possibility of &quot;infinite history&quot; in much the same words you&#x27;ve used here. But that&#x27;s a different issue than Smolin&#x27;s notion of infinitely many layers of <i>theory</i> being needed to keep the cosmic machinery running.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m not overly bothered by the notion of space and time existing forever in both directions, with new bubbles of interesting reality occasionally spawning themselves from the remnants of the old ones at random after uncounted eons of darkness. I don&#x27;t know why that structure might exist rather than something else (or why there is something rather than nothing), but positing a &quot;first cause&quot; wouldn&#x27;t make me any more satisfied (and would raise additional questions). I think modern math and science are more comfortable with the possibility of infinity than folks used to be, and that our notion of a &quot;cause&quot; is rather different.

We have more data for a single user than in most startups&#x27; entire database. That means big technical challenges to solve as we scale out our fledgling distributed backend. If you have experience with automated deployments, debugging running systems, release engineering, and on-call schedules, but are still comfortable writing code, this job[1] might be for you. :)<p>Many people spend their entire days buried in mail clients which haven&#x27;t significantly changed in years. That means many opportunities to tackle UX challenges as we build out our client scaffolds and create a new framework for the next generation of mail apps. (Ever meet anyone who really loves their email experience? We want to change that.) Sound exciting to you?

We&#x27;ve been careful to keep our architecture componentized.<p>* Our frontend projects use Coffeescript, React, (Re)Flux, WebSQL for offline caching, Atom Shell (NodeJS + Chromium), with a strong focus on extensibility.<p>* Tons of our code is open source. Check it out: <a href=""https://github.com/inboxapp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/inboxapp</a><p>* We&#x27;re 40% women on our team of 13 (12 engineers), including 1 of 2 cofounders. We want to make that number 50%.<p>* Our sunny Mission office is more lived-in than tidy. Think art studio, not corporate.<p>* We&#x27;re more likely to end up at the climbing gym or on a bike ride together than out drinking at the latest startup event.<p>* We have an open vacation policy and value personal responsibility and ownership.

This is because we felt we understood what that exact market wanted better than anyone else and had a unique opportunity to deliver on it.<p>The intention from the start was to make a business that makes a profit, not to make a company with the intention of selling out. Infact, when we did do a capital raise at one point we were very clear in our pitch to investors that the intention was to distribute profit via dividends.<p>We have been successful at doing that and the project felt like a reasonably sure thing from beginning to end even when it took a lot more time and budget than we were expecting. We were 100% confident that the exact market that we were targeting existed and that they would give us money when we were done. In our minds, the only thing that could go wrong was failing to finish the product by running out of money.<p>Now admittedly this particular tale is probably just survivorship bias so you should take it with a grain of salt.<p>However, my point is just that there are a lot of little markets that VCs will not care about because they are too small.

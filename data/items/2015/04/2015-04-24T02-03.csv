9431185,comment,9425867,9429546,0,0,pistle,,,"Generally agreed.<p>PL&#x27;s are a part product of all of history of computing, but a bigger part is a product of the programming Zeitgeist. It&#x27;s better to be a young language than to have matured 15-20 years already. Certain syntactic or other choices bite you inthe ass in a new zeitgeist. When I saw Java&#x27;s implementations of lambda stuff, I cringed a bit. Java&#x27;s friction in generics, due to choices made about typing, also made me say, &quot;Ouch.&quot;<p>I like to think I&#x27;ve matured out of the language and platform warrior mode enough to yield more objective consideration beyond my most-used and favorites (and are they favorites because they are most used or because they are so good?).<p>F# has given C# a nice boost in the juicer, but certain earlier choices are ossified and make later adaptations more challenging or, potentially, near impossible to do, do well/right.<p>I like that C# is going across OS&#x27;s, but were also entering the Age of Containers and there are implications, opportunities, and challenges we have barely started considering.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the future holds, but I know there will be curly braces and that tabs will win the day again... <i>ducks</i>",1429844386

Before O&#x27;Connor retired, <i>she</i> was considered the swing vote, and Kennedy was lumped in with the conservatives, for the same 4-4-1 breakdown; they just shuffle around the ostensible camps to keep it that way whenever the composition of the court changes.<p>(Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, I think lots of people who don&#x27;t follow the Court closely would be surprised at how few decisions are actually decided 5-4 along left-right lines. The majority of decisions, even under the Roberts court, are unanimous, and 6-3 or 7-2 decisions are also quite common, as are 5-4 splits along some axis other than the &quot;expected&quot; one.

Of course, you don&#x27;t do it with Erlang either! Erlang carefully takes all file I/O out of their actor model and has it so that one (and only one) process can interact with a file handle. Operations to this have to be serialized by the actor. Since there is only one implementation of I/O and it&#x27;s non-blocking, this works fine, but <i>if your application is an actor pipeline you run exactly the same risk as your mailbox overflows</i>. Needham&#x27;s Duality is real.<p>And naturally that ignores the fact that JVM concurrency and parallelism can handle that outcome perfectly well (and in fact Akka appeals to these primitives). It&#x27;s absurd to suggest that java.util.concurrent doesn&#x27;t have great tools for parallel anything, let alone parallel I/O.<p>Golang, by the way, doesn&#x27;t have this restriction. The runtime supports non-blocking, parallel-friendly I/O from the ground up.<p>And as for Node.js, well the general abstraction here is the most parallel of all. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of it and I agree it&#x27;s a bit leaky, but Node&#x27;s cluster stuff is serviceable and used by many. You cannot argue the actor model is essential, threadpools and actors ultimately model the same process and as Go has shown can do so with similar sharing semantics.<p>Finally, Erlang&#x27;s scheduler is not black magic nor an arcane work of wisdom. It uses well-known, well documented principles and techniques. Quite frankly, its not the secret sauce of Erlang. Erlang&#x27;s secret sauce is the HUGE some of very good code for building a distributed system with all the robust goodness that OTP provides.<p>Erlang&#x27;s great, Elixir is interesting (albeit it took one stinky old syntax and exchanged it for another stinky syntax). I wanted to reply to that prior post and talk to why Erlang has a magical recipe for <i>distributed</i> code, not <i>parallel</i> code. Quite frankly, Erlang&#x27;s parallelism story only makes sense in the context of its decision to make remote and local execution indistinguishable at the call site.",1429842654

9431057,comment,9426103,9430935,0,0,phamilton,,,"In Akka, multiple actors share a pool of threads. This has a lot of implications:<p>1. Garbage Collection. Garbage Collection on the JVM is not isolated to actors. One actor causing a lot of memory churn will prompt a garbage collection and prevent all other actors from executing until the Garbage Collector is finished. BEAM (the erlang VM) has per process (aka per actor) garbage collection, so actors will not interfere with each other during garbage collection.<p>2. Shared Memory. Since the JVM does not provide proper isolation guarantees, actors can in fact access shared memory. Safety in concurrency is accomplished via best practices rather than guaranteed by the VM. The BEAM VM does not allow shared memory. It is impossible for two processes to write to the same memory. While this matches the convention in Akka, it is enforced at the VM level.<p>3. Scheduler. In Akka, actors are oversubscribed to threads. That&#x27;s why you can have hundreds of thousands of actors on a single system. The abstraction is great, but the implementation means that calling Thread.sleep is going to tie up a thread. If you do that often enough then all the threads will get tied up and the rest of the actors will be unable to make progress. The BEAM VM handles this scheduling at a much lower level. Calling sleep on an Erlang process is no big deal. While sleep is a contrived example, the effect on the ecosystem is pretty big. Using a blocking HTTP client on Akka is a bad idea. You have to use something like Dispatch or Spray which is essentially callback based (via monadic Futures). In Erlang, you just make the blocking call and the scheduler takes care of it. Since the synchronous code is easier to reason about than asynchronous code, the Erlang solution is simpler, easier to maintain and often more performant.<p>I&#x27;ve spoken with a number of seasoned Scala/Java programmers who basically tell me &quot;Of course you shouldn&#x27;t do that, just do X or Y&quot;. With Erlang, I find there are fewer situations where you need to be an expert to avoid screwing things up.",1429841464

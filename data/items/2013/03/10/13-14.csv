I almost certainly know more about mental illness than you do. What makes people crazy in urban areas is expensive real estate. It's not signing the ridiculous rent checks that does it-- that's just annoying. However, moving involuntarily-- especially when due to adverse economic circumstances-- has a <i>huge</i> detrimental effect on mental health, even inducing illnesses such as schizophrenia[0] which might otherwise be thought to be purely biological.<p>[0] Schizophrenia, like cancer and depression, probably isn't one disease. There are at least 5 different schizophrenias.<p>Next to genetics and drug abuse, the strongest predictor for mental illness is whether a person had to move involuntarily for economic reasons. Traditionally, this was a cause for the high rate of mental illness in urban areas. (However, the recent housing catastrophe was a mostly suburban phenomenon; we'll see in about 10 years if that results in suburban MI levels exceeding urban ones)<p>If you ban high-rises, real estate costs become extreme.

But, since you've decided to immediately call into question people's credentials, let me start with mine. I've done a little over 30 years of software development, and in that time I've programmed in no less than three assembly languages, several BASICs, Pascal, C, C++, JavaScript, dabbled with C#, dabbled with Go, dabbled with Python, been subjected to some Perl and PHP, etc. I'm not God's Gift to Software Development, but I think I have enough experience that my opinion on this matter shouldn't be discarded as uninformed.<p>""and starts with the antique assumption that the runtime/checked exception dichotomy is a good idea.""<p>I hope you're aware that you're begging the question. In any case, I think checked exceptions are <i>fantastic</i>.<p>1. The ""burden"" of dealing with them is minuscule, especially when using modern IDEs. It takes just a few clicks or key presses to add try/catch blocks or re-throw exceptions as necessary. You don't even have to waste time looking up documentation (which may be wrong or even nonexistent). Your tool-chain (IDE and compiler) handles the mundane details for you.<p>2. It forces developers, who are often hurried, and who often make mistakes, to think about things that could go wrong, and deal with them (one way or another). Oh, sure, you see plenty of ""catch (Exception e)"" style abuses, but that particular ""code smell"" is so strong (i.e., easily identified) that it can make code reviews (personal and public) easier. Code reviews in languages with only unchecked exceptions are much more difficult and time consuming.<p>3. Checked exceptions speeds development. Much less time is spent reading and re-reading API documentation to make sure you've caught all the possible exceptions that might be thrown (so that you can do things like produce meaningful error messages or log entries based on the exception thrown).<p>4. Unchecked exceptions are a production run-time nightmare. My anecdotal but extensive experience is that languages with only unchecked exceptions cause far too many costly (in both time and money) production headaches. Never, ever defer until run-time, errors that can be caught at compile-time! Admittedly, it could be that my application domain colors my opinion here (I work on large systems, not small systems).<p>The best argument I've heard against checked exceptions is that they ""bloat the code"". It's true: checked exceptions requires more code. But I'm writing code, not poetry. My job is to get the implementation right (which checked exceptions help me do) and to write reliable and robust software. Developers who put more emphasis on writing pretty code (sorry, ""highly expressive"") might want to consider becoming artists instead, where they can fashion ""pretty"" creations to their heart's content.",1362922546

In addition, the $20 coupon for another Origin game that was given to those who bought the game through Origin will also be used as a write-off against the $50+ the game went against.  If we assume that the value of the games that they will offer for their ""apology"" will be around $35-40, then they will have effectively written off the entire purchase price of SimCity in ""promotional"" and ""apology"" give-aways, thus turning the aforementioned ""unmitigated disaster"" into EA's most profitable quarter ever.

5351713,comment,5351261,5351261,11,0,michaelochurch,,,"Relational databases have a sound mathematical model. You may not think of it this way, but a table can be seen as a <i>predicate</i> in logical terms. You can frame most logical queries as a chaining of predicates and functions, and you can create arbitrary (finite) predicates using tables. That's powerful.<p>NoSQL came into style with the web, in which you have large data sets but don't need most of the relational features. You might have a trillion Wuphfs, but you'll never need ad-hoc queries because you're doing mostly CRUD on the Wuphfs. Sharded SQL is a painful way to deal with that problem space. NoSQL systems are often better adapted to it. NoSQL is almost always <i>less powerful</i> abstractly but easier to scale.<p>The major problem that I've seen with NoSQL systems is that they tend not to handle the edge cases very well. Remember the old joke about the man who goes to the doctor and says, ""It hurts when I do this"", so the doctor says ""Don't do that"". Sometimes, you have to ""do that"". Many NoSQL products are also quite low-level, requiring that more traditional database functionality be written in client code. That gets nasty-- slow, flimsy, hard to coordinate. You don't want, for example, clients to be responsible for generating sequential unique IDs because the clients all have to agree on what the rules are, in addition to generating a lot of communication overhead each time a new block of IDs is requested.<p>Furthermore, if you're using NoSQL to build something that will be marketed as a database product (e.g. within your company) and are exposed to requirement accretion, you'll find that the requirements are often inspired by expectations derived from relational models: ACID transactions being the big one.<p>I am not saying that SQL is the best for all problems, but it is a damn good technology. Personally, I think that a lot of SQL hate comes from the limitations of MySQL. If that's the source of your headaches, look into Postgres. Postgres is surprising in how modern and powerful it is.",1362921044

I might not know all about typography, but I do know quite a bit. I would say more than the average person, so if I don't get what you mean really, it's probably a good idea to expand on it, if you stand behind those statements. And if I got the wrong ideas from your short critique, please do educate us, I'm always willing to learn.<p>Hinting. Can you give me an example of how it's poorly hinted? From what I've always seen, Comic Sans is actually hinted rather well, and in my opinion actually gets <i>better</i> at smaller point sizes (mainly because with less pixels the shapes and kerning become more regular).<p>Contrast. Now about the zero contrast, I suppose what you really meant is that the lines are all equal thickness, which is something different than ""contrast"" because you're going to have appearance of heavier weight at the connections of the lines, which is why Helvetica and Arial actually have varying stroke widths, to give the appearance of uniform weight. You can argue this gives Comic Sans <i>bad</i> or <i>uneven</i> contrast, and I'd be inclined to agree. But zero contrast doesn't make sense to me when referring to Comic Sans.<p>Additionally, how does this automatically disqualify a font from print or display? Especially really large display, I've seen it in large rainbow coloured logos at children's daycare centres, and it works just fine there.<p>Harmony. I did some Googling to make sure, but the <i>only</i> typographical meaning of the term ""harmony"" that I've been able to find is the one that I already knew, and it's not something you can attribute to a font. It's to do with the rhythm and contrasts of spacing and weights (and more) on a page or part of a page. You can say it's hard to make a harmonious design with Comic Sans, but you cannot say Comic Sans does not ""have"" harmony.<p>I do agree it's not particularly suitable for body text (unless you happen to have dyslexia, but there's prettier fonts that help there, unfortunately they're not free).<p>(Sans) serif. Not a true sans-serif, how is this bad? The author explains his choice and I think <i>that</i> particular choice was a great one. In today's digital world, differences between Il|1 can be <i>crucial</i>, and can't always be inferred from context, most typographical conventions followed out of a need for medium-specific legibility, and I'm afraid you're going to have to deal with the fact that mixing serif and sans-serif is now a valid design choice.<p>I still don't particularly like Comic Sans myself either, but for different reasons (that I explained elsewhere in this thread).",1362920757

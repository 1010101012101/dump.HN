722529,comment,722294,722485,0,0,philwelch,,,"Your metadata is yours, and Apple is not stopping you from doing anything with it. A lot of it is already in the m4a file anyway, using either ID3 tags or some newer analog to them. As for whatever metadata is stored outside the music files themselves, iTunes actually gives you all the metadata you need: it shows you the metadata plainly. What they don't do is maintain a requirement that any arbitrary device or program can reliably access that metadata, i.e. by keeping it in a consistent, well-documented format. That's an engineering decision, not a moral imperative--it allows them flexibility to do things their way instead of worrying about breaking backward or third party compatibility.<p>Apple's margins on iTunes are pretty low, when you consider how much they have to pay out to record labels and credit card companies even before paying for their own infrastructure. Digital media is high-margin in total, but only if you can realize all the profit. The record labels can do that, but Apple can't.",1248472723

Since they have never really opened either side of this equation to third parties it's hard to argue any monopolistic behavior here. Apple isn't stopping anyone from developing their own hardware, software and online store and making a competing platform with the same level of integration that consumers seem to want. It's not Apple's fault that no one has been able to step up and produce a legitimate competitor yet. Like any company Apple is obligated to maximize their profits and protect their market share. We can argue if it's good or bad for the consumer but honestly it's irrelevant. That's how capitalism works. I do not see any legitimate OSS projects offering a comparable platform. Apple (especially since dropping DRM) is not impeding their ability to do it.",1248472702

The thing that put me off doing my open source project is that some people don't have the chops to sys admin their own boxes, and try to get free help from me. They try to make out it's my code of course: ""I can't get the database to load into MySQL. Can you fix it?"" ""It's saying something about 'can't load module nnn'. Is it broken?"" I try to be civil but after three or four iterations (""OK, it loads but now I get some error in the logs about 'Can't connect to database'. I wonder what that could be?"") well, life's too short and I have actual systems to run, actual bills to pay.<p>So although your counterpoint is good I would nonetheless say the author is spot on, and there are an awful lot of rude bastards out there who don't deserve free code, let alone free support.",1248469297

That would be fine with me, as long as we had similar rules for global labor as we do for global capital.<p>Free trade agreements are negotiated painstakingly to make the treatment of investments uniform across countries. In the process, they usually accord some special treatment to professional classes. I myself am a beneficiary of such rules -- as a Canadian professional, I can skip across the border to the USA with just a little bit of documentation.<p>We don't have anything equivalent for labor. This seems to me to be a great omission, if not an outright scam. Even after free trade between the US and Canada and Mexico, we don't allow workers to cross borders. Nor do we have uniform standards for the treatment of labor like we do for capital, either.<p>It seems to me to be deliberate -- they want the workers to be stuck with the local situation, and they want local governments to compete on lowering benefits and labor standards.",1248469237

Even if it sucks, you'll have an easier time convincing yourself that it is an Important Book.<p>That said, I think there are cases where you should plow through a book you don't (at first) enjoy. E.g. when a book comes highly recommended by people you trust, or from an author who has delivered in the past.  This is especially true for older books that were written for less attention-sapped audiences and have cultural gaps that take getting used to.  I'm thinking of Dostoevsky's ""The Brothers Karamazov."" It was highly reccomended by friends with good taste, and I had enjoyed some of his shorter works. Still, it was <i>incredibly</i> slow getting started. But once I had ingested the multi-layered background and got a grip on Russian peasant culture, was one of the more amazing books I've ever read.  And could not have been otherwise if not for the investment required to get into it.",1248469235

I think we need to work on this page a lot more to make it more usable, and of course understandable, but hopefully still retaining its 'edgy' visual appearance. <p>The contents page is meant the be hub of 'what is exciting and new' within QueensSpeech (like a magazine contents page) - only the highest rated and most read articles by our community appear on the contents page. <p>We also have an RSS feed available which lists all new content submitted ( <a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/queensspeech"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feeds.feedburner.com/queensspeech</a> ).<p>I'm really happy that you spent time going through the site again, and hopefully next time you visit you will be able to experience some of the improvements we have planned!",1180048737

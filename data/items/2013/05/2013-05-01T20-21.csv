You've corrected some of the recurring mistakes they made when they first started, but now new ones are coming up. You make notes of the employee's progress and give honest feedback. They continue to improve. Slowly. Improving <i>just enough</i> so that HR has strong reservations about starting the termination process. You're stuck with a dud employee that, yeah, they're not absolutely <i>horrible</i>, but you know that you'd be much better off with an employee that could at least get things right the second time instead of the 20th.<p>""You shouldn't have hired them,"" I hear you say.

Fortunately, ThinkPad is a good company, and they make it relatively easy to locate and download the right network driver to put on a thumb drive, if you don't have an install disk handy (happens more commonly than you suggest). This is easy if you know what you're doing, but, of course, next to impossible without some power user knowledge (it also requires access to another computer with a working internet connection and a thumb drive).<p>And also to be fair, XP is in a valid sense only one version out of date. Vista was a fiasco, and that's not just a meme -- Vista was released way ahead of schedule and still had a ton of known unresolved bugs. It was by far MS's most buggy release, and the whole thing was a disaster. Compared to the relative stability of XP, Vista was a step backwards. And while Windows 7 can rightly be called a newer version of Windows XP (and is better in nearly every way), it would be a stretch to say that Windows 8 is a newer version of Windows 7. Windows 8 is a fork into a different paradigm, and is so different it's not even comparable to Windows 7 along a number of dimensions.<p>All that said, XP is still pretty damn out of date, even with the latest service pack installed, and if Windows 7 is an option, it's usually a better one. Of course, XP uses less memory, so it may be suitable for particularly old computers. And for people that don't like to pirate software, owning a copy XP is a great reason to stick with XP (if it works well enough, why fork out the money for Windows 7?).",1367441628

The government isn't obligated to facilitate it and businesses aren't forced to allow it. voidnull's access to anonymity rests solely on SDF's goodwill and solvency. And the government could easily harrass them, even if they are overseas.<p>Which brings up an interesting thought experiment: what would it look like if anonymity were guaranteed by law, how could it be implemented reliably and verifiably, and what would the counter-balance be against illegal activity?",1367441234

Wrote up a business plan with monetization, p&l, etc. I brought the plan and prototype to a few seed folks for early funding before I admittedly lost interest and moved onto something else.<p>The hardest technical challenge I had was, knowing there would need to be a ton of recipes in the system to make it truly effective, I had to do an automated intake of recipes from many places. But ingredient normalization got in the way, even with really good regex/etl practices. For instance, a recipe says, ""boneless skinless chicken breast"".. another says, ""skinless boneless chicken breast"". Some list the # of breasts. Some list pounds. Some mean the breast is split, some don't. But in order for the nutrition info to be accurate, the normalization process had to be near perfect.<p>I ended up ""buying"" the source code to ""recipefox"" a recipe parsing plugin for firefox (for $100 or something like that) which helped tremendously, but still wasn't good enough for my tastes. I felt like to make it all work, i needed to essentially build a recipe ETL.<p>The monetization was kind of cool, I felt. Free for users. I felt that companies (food companies, supermarkets, etc) would put coupons for specific brands or specific stores on printed-out shopping lists based on the weekly recipes. i actually got alot of interest from that one from actual supermarkets. Thought that was cool.<p>Good luck with this. It was a tremendous idea 4 years ago and I always wondered when someone else was going to do it because it just seemed so damn obvious to me.<p>""I have a gluten free child and a wife on a diet.

The key distinction, for me, is that the machine is not a game in and of itself, but an interface for offering multiple games.<p>(For those who didn't read the article, the scheme basically involves playing game A at the minimum wager until you get a big win, then switching to game B at a higher wager until the game B reaches a certain state, and then switching back to game A, at which point the machine would re-calculate your earlier win in game A based on your (higher) wager in game B.)<p>The nearest analog I can think of is switching roulette table chips between tables of different denominations. When you buy roulette chips, the croupier notes the value of a stack of 20 chips, usually $20, $100, or $500 a stack, by placing a token near the wheel. Looking at a single chip, it's impossible to tell whether the chip is worth $1, $5, or $25. And a given color chip at one table may be worth $1, while at a neighboring table it's worth $25. Table chips are marked with a letter on their face indicating which table they belong to, but croupiers don't always examine the letters, so if you slip chips between tables, you might be able to wager a low-denomination chip and be paid off in high-denomination chips. That's definitely cheating, even if the casino doesn't immediately stop you from slipping chips between games.<p>My general rule of thumb is that anything that happens within a game is fair play. If the exploit had been that a particular sequence of wagers would cause the random number generator to behave in a predictable way, then I'd be fine with it. But I wouldn't consider the game-selection interface to be part of the game.",1367440662

5640620,comment,5639109,5639773,3,0,ahlatimer,,,"If schools judged CS applicants by their ability to program, I'd agree, but they don't. They judge them based upon their likelihood to succeed in the program (amongst other things, like building a diverse student body or whatever). That is, they judge them by their ability to be a good student. If all of the evidence goes to show that a prospect is a terrible student, why would a University accept them knowing that they are likely to fail?<p>Now, your friends may be more than capable at succeeding in university, and if a school only took the time to get to know them, they might see that, but, on paper, they look the same as someone who likely couldn't succeed in school (because they haven't, really, up to that point).<p>That all sounds all horrible about universities, disregarding these capable students because of an inability to really get to know prospects, but that's not on them. If you want to get into a good school, try harder.<p>As far as it defeating the point of getting an education, I'd wholly agree that college is not a worthwhile pursuit for a future-SE if your only reason for going is to get a job. You'll spend a lot of time in college learning skills that are not directly applicable to your future employment.

Should I be able to sue them?

I certainly don't get to sue the casino for exploiting my gambling addiction or the fact that I had a little too much to drink before my last bet.<p>Look, let's be honest here: casinos are nothing more than legal (and sure, transparent) scams, plain and simple (at least when its house vs. customer and not customer vs. customer). The rules are systematically designed to drain you of your money while tricking you into thinking you might win. And I have absolutely <i>no problem</i> with that. I am a free market guy, and as far as I'm concerned gambling is voluntary. HOWEVER, if you are going to dedicate your business to literally ruining people's lives and profiting from their losses, then suck it up when you are too stupid and your con backfires on you. Don't get the law involved, and thus <i>my taxpayer dollars</i>, to save you from your unsuccessful grift.

Both compilation and execution speed are really fast, so you have both quick edit-compile-test turnarounds similar to a scripting language while having the execution speed of native code. Not quite as fast as C and C++, but getting there.<p>Writing concurrent code is incredibly easy with the primitives Go provides: goroutines (think of them like green threads multiplexed to 1 to very few OS threads) and channels (similar to pipes). No more faffing around with details of thread creation and teardown or an unreadable mess of callbacks (like you would have in system with event loops).

5640565,comment,5637663,5637663,28,0,lsc,,,"So, uh, I'm looking for an entry-level sysadmin/data-center monkey.  You could call this an intern type position, but I don't care if you are in school or not.<p>Prgmr.com rents virtual private servers, dedicated servers, and datacenter space.  Right now, we have 3 full-time folks, counting me, and two part-timers but I'm the only hardware person, and only two of us are local.<p>So, there are several catches.  the first?  I can't afford a full time person for at least two months.   If you are willing to show up and work between then and now?  $15/hr on a 1099.  After those two months (and after I'm done paying for twice the co-lo I need)  we can talk about going full time W2.  (prgmr.com pays for Kaiser, if you are full-time)<p>Now, I do have an arrangement with a local refurbished server and network hardware dealer;  I give him a good entry level person, he'll hire them full time with health insurance and stuff (for a little more than I'm paying;  not a lot more, this is definitely still entry-level pay.)  and he'll rent you back to me on a per-day basis at a discount (sort of as a referral bonus to me.)   - so that's one way you can make this full-time before I stabilize prgmr.com.   Note, he's based out of mountain view, and I'm in Santa Clara and all of this is very much hands-on work.<p>So yeah, what I need is someone I can teach how to handle my layer-1.   I need my shit wired up, I need it wired up neatly (I can train you in cable lacing, but the neater you are, the better.)   I need all my ports labeled inside my network gear (I can show you how to do this; Serial ain't rocket science.)  and inside my PDUs.<p>This would be pretty good for someone studying up on their CCNA or something;  I probably have obsolete hardware I could give you for your lab, too.<p>I need someone I can train up to set up my IPMI out of band access.  Again, I can train, it's not hard.    Again, experience using the command line helps a lot.<p>I also need someone who can handle racking/stacking servers, dragging servers to the car and back.  You need to be able to safely lift 50lbs, (and more importantly, you need to ask for help when you /can't/ lift safely.  pester the security guys;  they will usually help, and if not, call me.)  and you need transportation that can handle 50lb servers.  (meh, if you have transportation, we can probably work something out with the hauling.  I've got an old van I loan people.)<p>You need to be able to handle ssh, and ssh with public key authentication with minimal help from me.<p>So, the way I usually do this is that people email me, we go back and forth a few times (I won't hire you if you can't communicate via email... sorry, just one of my things.)  then next time I need help I call you up.   You show up and work.  I pay you (check, but if you want we can drop by the bank and get it cashed for you same day... just when I pay cash the accountant gets mad at me)   If you do well and I need help again, i call you back;   At these rates, (and especially with this (lack of) stability) it's not fair to expect you to interview for free.<p>So yeah.  Entry level.    If you seem teachable, I don't care if you are currently unemployed.<p>I demand honesty, but not loyalty;  by that, I mean I'm realistic. I'm not going to be angry if you move on to a better paying job quickly.<p>Especially at first, while we're just doing 'as needed' gigs?  I'm understanding about your schedule;  I don't demand you drop everything for me.  (Once you go full time, we'll have to talk more about this.   I do eventually want someone besides me to be hardware on-call, but I understand that needs to be worth your time, and this offer probably is probably not good enough to get you to let me drag your ass out of bed at 2am.)",1367440042

Our consultants spend their days sliding up and down the ladder of abstraction, rapidly assimilating unfamiliar systems (and then breaking them). One week you're pulling apart macros in a Lisp app; the next, you're on your hands and knees crawling through x86 disassembly.<p>We move fast. Our projects run on tight deadlines: one or two weeks is typical. Recently we wrote a bespoke proxy to rip apart a custom encrypted protocol, tamper with messages, and cobble it back together again. That could be a two-week job in itself. At Matasano, that's just Tuesday.<p>We find bugs. Not just in applications, but in the tools they're built with. That includes some of the biggest open-source and proprietary software stacks in the world.<p>This is the <i>Mission: Impossible</i> of software gigs, and we need the best people to get the job done. NO PRIOR APPSEC EXPERIENCE REQUIRED. We need great software developers and fast learners, for we intend to go in harm's way. If this sounds interesting to you, we should absolutely talk.<p>Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of software applications?<p><i>Matasano knows.</i><p>Full benefits. Free books.

According to google plus, your name is Luc Jansen, where the last name is fake, which really doesn't help. I guess I could send you an email with an image sent from a server, which then reads you ip adress out of the request, but i guess you have html embedded images disabled in all your email accounts. There is some photos of you on G+, but then you only share them with some of your friends, which means I'd need to find a less computer savy friend of yours and see whether I can acess his account. Depending on how many, and what kind of photos there are, I might be able to narrow down roughly where you live and how you look or where you go to school (you're 19, so that's kinda hit or miss). You don't look like a picture person from your twitter though. So there'd be multiple avenues for SE. I'm pretty sure Authorities could find you quite easily given only that link.",1367438742

This fits well with all of the Lean Startup stuff: startups are an experiment.<p>In other words, before you're actually at scale, how do you know what your requirements are? Better to build things in something that lets you discover these requirements as quickly as possible, then fix an inconsistencies in what you've built, rather than try to imagine what your future requirements may be, build that, and turn out to be wrong.<p>To use one of the more famous examples of a pivot, if the Flickr team had spent a ton of time analyzing their anticipated needs for a game engine, that would have all been wasted when they pivoted to photo sharing.<p>On the smaller scale, if you asked me today why rendering GitHub's views is slow, I probably would have guessed that it's their SOA-style architecture, an overhead between components.

The first is the building of alliances, persuading, and general social skills-based work you mention. That's totally fine and expected-this is the positive form of politics.<p>The negative form of politics is when a manager's best interests are misaligned with the company or their direct reports. For example, John may not want to promote Bill, his star employee, if it means that Bill will join a different department and Bill's successes will no longer contribute to John's success. So John is incentivized to give his best employees moderate, but not great performance ratings. This is clearly negative for Bill and for the company as a whole.",1367438539

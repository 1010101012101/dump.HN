4499039,comment,4498794,4498794,1,0,adrianhoward,,,"Interesting that this repeats Martin Fowler's definition of technical debt (<a href=""http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html</a>). While Fowler references Ward Cunningham as the originator of the term I think he gives an interestingly different definition.<p>Fowler says<p>""You have a piece of functionality that you need to add to your system. You see two ways to do it, one is quick to do but is messy - you are sure that it will make further changes harder in the future. The other results in a cleaner design, but will take longer to put in place. Technical Debt is a wonderful metaphor developed by Ward Cunningham to help us think about this problem. In this metaphor, doing things the quick and dirty way sets us up with a technical debt, which is similar to a financial debt. ""<p>Here the decision to take on technical debt is a deliberate one. You <i>knowingly</i> taking the quick-n-dirty route because of time constraints, not because you don't understand the ""good"" design.<p>Here's a video of Ward talking about technical debt (referenced in Fowler's definition)<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqeJFYwnkjE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqeJFYwnkjE</a><p>Here he talks about debt being something that you notice later. You learn more about what the solution should be, and need to go back and refactor your code so it reflects your new best understanding of the code. Debt is something that builds up over time, and you need to pay it off regularly so that the debt doesn't become disabling.<p>At about 3:20 he talks explicitly about the idea of knowingly writing poor code:<p>""A lot of bloggers at least have explained the debt metaphor and confused it I think with the idea that you could write code poorly with the intention of doing a good job later and thinking that was the primary source of debt. I'm never in favour of writing code poorly, but I am in favour of writing code to reflect your current understanding of the problem even if that understanding is partial"".<p>Not trying to say one definition is good, and the other bad, but the difference gives you quite a different approach. Read Fowler's piece. Watch Ward's video. Have a think :-)",1347271151

Is this correct?<p>I wouldn't call that a definition. Here's a working one: my consciousness is the part of me which thinks and feels, which enjoys music and mountains and friends and so forth. Computers as of now can take input, but can't experience input the way I do; the gap is what I call consciousness. (To this definition your above description does apply.)<p>> ""Do you think that this means your consciousness has nothing to do with your claim to be conscious?"" Yes, that is exactly what I think. Although replace ""consciousness"" with ""the act of experiencing existence"" and that is a much closer semantic match to what I am attempting to convey.<p>This is the bit I'm having trouble with. For me, I experience things, and then state that I experience things. The relationship is direct and causal. From what I understand you experience things and then state that you experience things, and these facts are completely unrelated? I'm pretty sure Occam had something to say about that.",1347270132

I see gathering clouds (A), and on that basis I predict rain (B) -- and puddles (C).<p>You are using the temporal sense of the word ""predict"", not the cross-sectional sense.

Notice this prediction was made independent of time.<p>>> A prediction forges a link between an observation (A) and an outcome (B). It assumes a cause-effect relationship, one that may not be real, but a word isn't responsible for how people misuse it.<p>A prediction forges a link between an observation (A) and an outcome (B) to explain a correlation relationship, which may or may not be because of a cause-effect relationship.<p>>> Yes -- an observation of a small sample (A) is used as the basis for a prediction about the population as a whole (B). Also, remember that ""prediction"" commonly refers to an assertion about the future (B) based on present observations (A).<p>Let's say I am a statistician and after surveying 10% of the population, found out lower income earners are correlated with a lower IQ.

""old"" in this article means that it is a long way away and so is observed as it was a long time ago (light takes time to travel from the galaxy to our telescope) and so the galaxy <i>we are seeing</i> is actually [as it was when it was] <i>new</i>.  in general, it is expected that galaxies start off as amorphous blobs and (some) become spiral-like as they get older (simplifying hugely).  the problem here is that this galaxy [as we see it] is so <i>new</i> (which the article calls ""old""!) that it hasn't had time to become such a nice-looking spiral.  so it's not ""keeping form"" as much as ""achieving form too early"".]<p>anyway, back to the question.  you can divide astronomy into two halves.  there's the serendipitous ""interesting object"" work, like this paper, and then there's the ""survey"" work.  the two are complementary - detailed studies turn up new ideas but can be very misleading (due to chance - this is a good example, where it seems that something looks ""mature"" simply because it has been disrupted in a way that, accidentally, makes it look like something it is not).  in contrast, surveys give us reliable knowledge of how things work ""on average"", so are more reliable, but take more time and are very ""broad brush"" (and usually rely on the earlier detailed work for a ""focus"").<p>my guess is that a terra-forming (well, galaxy forming) civilization could mislead the former, but not the latter.  this is because the universe is very big :o) - the aliens would need time travel and / or faster than light travel (arguably the same thing and generally considered unlikely) in order to affect large volumes of the observable universe.  particularly if they took a reasonable time to evolve (you could argue that galaxies need to form and ""settle down"" before things are stable enough for live to evolve to such a level).",1347268955

They WOULD have to be willing to do that IF they were going to pursue that goal. They aren't. He's positing the idea that if they were properly optimized for the black swans then they would see a much lower funding rate. Not that they should aim for a low funding rate for it's own sake.

4498923,comment,4498507,4498750,23,0,dalke,,,"Let's say that most people learn about families only through watching 1950s live-action TV; Ozzie and Harriet, The Donna Reed Show, Leave It To Beaver, and even I Love Lucy. Can I not say that those portray an idealized version of family life, rather than a real one? And that they should not be use as a guide for how a real family should interact?<p>Yet your logic would be that ""the moment you try to judge what 'real' families are, you have stopped being reasonable."" I do no think I am being unreasonable to say that Ozzie and Harriet does not portray a real family. Yes it was very popular, and that show is still used as short-hand expressing a longing for an idyllic bygone American life, but the situations and reactions were only valid for a very small percentage of the US. It took another 15 years, with shows like All in the Family, for more realistic themes like miscarriage, impotence, and racism to be included as part of the issues that families might deal with. Roseanne would also fit into that category, as Barr included a lesbian main character because Barr sought ""to portray various slices of real life, and homosexuals are a reality.""<p>Why can't I also say that most pornography does as good a job of portraying real sex as Leave It To Beaver does at portraying a real family with husband, wife, and two sons?<p>Our disagreement could be a simple as a difference in what 'real' means. I use it as ""more likely to be characteristic of the general culture practice."" You seem to interpret it as ""whatever can happen in the physical world.""<p>In which case, sure, I Love Lucy could be a perfectly accurate portrayal of a real family - unlikely, but it could. And it misses the point. That being: The issue Im tackling is not porn, she said. Its the complete lack of open, healthy dialogue around porn and sex.",1347267887

They get corrected mostly over time.  Agreed.<p>What I was getting at is a more deliberate error, or a forced one.  The deliberate error is something like seeking affirmation for a character issue.  Racist seeks reinforcement for racism rather than enlightenment to get past racism.  The forced error could be something like an authoritarian childhood elevating dogma to fact, seriously impacting that person and their ability to grow and be objective.<p>Dominance / submission does drive a lot.

8747787,comment,8747053,8747053,0,0,adrusi,,,"While I don&#x27;t have a story quite like OP&#x27;s, I wanted to share my experiences with old-school programming in more recent history. In middle and high school (2008-2014), I had access to modern hardware, the internet and all those lovely things at home. At school, though, I didn&#x27;t have access to a computer most of the time, and yet I wanted to program. What I did have though, was a TI-84+SE graphing calculator, with a z80 cpu clocked at 15MHz and 24/128K accessible/total RAM, and 1.5/2.0MB of ROM. Most teachers didn&#x27;t really care if I just stuck my nose into that thing for the entire class, so often I did just that.<p>For those not familiar with the calculator, it ships with an OS that provides a shell where the user can input mathematical expressions, as well as a graphing interface. It also provides a program editor where the user can write what are essentially shell scripts for the main interface in TI-BASIC, or run machine code written in hex if the program starts with the AsmPrgm token. It also lets you transfer files from a PC using a usb port on the calculator. You could download and install &quot;Apps&quot; for the calculator. When I was 12-14 I mostly wrote small programs, like Pong and a quadratic factorization utility, in TI-BASIC, and played games that I downloaded in class.<p>After a while I tired of TI-BASIC because it was <i>slow</i>, and that limited the possibilities. I downloaded Axe, an App that modifies the code in RAM of Kernel&#x27;s TI-BASIC editor to allow for programs written in a different language, which was basically assembly + a lot of macros and a standard library useful for writing games, or like C without a type system. This code was compiled to machine code on the calculator, and therefore the code ran at a reasonable speed (keep in mind it&#x27;s still just a 15MHz cpu from the 70s).<p>With Axe I made some more interesting programs. Unlike with TI-BASIC, where learning the language was easy since the calculators main interface was basically a REPL for the programming language, Axe was hard to learn. I needed to look at external documentation to know what I was dong in Axe, but even though I had a smartphone at this point, I couldn&#x27;t use it in class, so I printed out the manual to reference it in class. I wrote a bunch of programs in Axe, like a cellular automata simulator, a game of life program, a 4-level grayscale sprite editor (which worked by flickering the pixels of the 1-bit display which had a slow enough response time to create a static gray color if alternated quickly enough). I also learned z80 assembly and used an on-calc assembler and editor called mimas, but editing assembly on-calc was too bothersome with a 64x96 display, so I mostly stuck with Axe.<p>Eventually I stopped being the nerdy kid who played with his calculator all day, but I had fallen in love with the platform, so even though I wasn&#x27;t writing code in class, I wrote code for the calculator at home, sometimes on my PC and sometimes on the calculator just because I liked that experience more.<p>I&#x27;ll be sad to see these ancient calculators finally phased out of the math curriculum in the US, so that kids no longer get access to that last stronghold of 80s computing. Raspberry Pi is cool, but it&#x27;s still so much more modern than the calculators, which hurts its coolness factor for me, but more importantly, kids won&#x27;t have access to it unless their parents want them to get into computing. Soon I see kids only having hardware that seems impenetrably locked down, which is a real shame.",1418546602

Would be better to rewrite history to remove anything that should not be there.<p>We ended up using the Apache v2 license, mainly because it requires granting copyright and patent licenses from contributors without getting them to sign a CLA.<p>In terms of having a successful open source project the most critical thing is to attract contributors. Some easy things you can do towards this end:<p>1. Simplify your installation process. I found that for Hummingbird the biggest barrier to new contributors right now is our complicated installation, and I am working on getting something working using Docker/Fig.<p>2. Identify some easy potential contributions and add them to your issue tracker. When I want to contribute to a project the first thing I do is look for easy issues, and a lot of projects make this easy by specifically tagging issues that would be easy for new contributors to tackle.<p>3. Like arielm said, documentation is very important. Make sure you have a well written README, CONTRIBUTING etc.",1418546430

Ergo, it doesn&#x27;t work for the US, but is working for China, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, ...<p>I would argue that you&#x27;re entire premise is wrong. You assume only the US is doing the killing here. That these terror organisations are just the friends of the locals. In reality, terror has 2 legs, one of which the US supports and the other the US bombs. That won&#x27;t work, and everybody realizes that. That&#x27;s not what they&#x27;re doing. Locals, especially mothers, are perfectly aware of what these terror organisations are trying to do and would like nothing better than keeping their kids and husbands away from them. Yet that&#x27;s not happening. Why not ? Well ...<p>Terror organisations, like Hamas, ISIS, ..., mainly do &quot;social&quot; work. Unemployment benefits, scholarships, marriage subsidies (and arranging marriages in the first place, in islamic societies there&#x27;s a huge need for this for obvious reasons), jobs, resolving conflicts, policing, food aid, child subsidies, ... They use the power they get through this to commit acts of terror, massacres and, if possible, invasions. In the case of Hamas, it&#x27;s social work is subsidized by the UN, paid for mostly by the US (because most UN member states don&#x27;t actually pay their dues).<p>Needless to say, these organisations need to be replaced. But they make it impossible to get to the local population, to offer them an alternative. You want an education and had the bad luck to be born in Gaza, Hamas can give it to you, no one else can. Needless to say, it comes with conditions. Getting married is the condition if you&#x27;re lucky, getting a family member to ... if you&#x27;re not. They are like the mafia, and will bomb anyone who tries to help locals outside of their system (they have bombed UN kindergartens, for instance).<p>In this way, the current islamic terror organisations are not all that different from their Soviet equivalents of 3-4 decades back. There is one company in Gaza : Hamas. There is one hospital in Gaza : Hamas. There is only one landlord in Gaza : Hamas (and nobody owns an apartment aside from Hamas leadership). There is one school in Gaza : Hamas. There is one university in Gaza : Hamas. There is one marriage organizer in Gaza : Hamas. There is one supermarket in Gaza : Hamas ... I don&#x27;t know, but I imagine the situation is similar in Iraq and other places. They are mafias that are a state, effectively.<p>This is why the problem is so hard. You have to kill these organisations, prevent their functioning, and then offer an alternative to locals. This is what they&#x27;re trying to do : kill off the top of these organisations. Give their lieutenants and middle management the chance to run away with the school money of half of Gaza, to give the UN a chance to open a fair school system without those conditions (for example).<p>More generally what needs to be done is to give the local population a real alternative for a life (&quot;a career&quot;, plus a few things) other than the local terror organisation. If you have better options available, I am positive everybody is itching to hear them. Today we are seeing that these organisations are moving into and establishing colonies in large European cities (though at the moment their &quot;net&quot; is very leaky, but still tight enough to make them grow anyway). Literally everybody wants to hear your solution for this. From the US, Western European states, China, to the Pakistani state and everybody in between. Please, please give them another solution, because, frankly, there are places, outside of the middle east, where this war is not going very well at all.",1418544033

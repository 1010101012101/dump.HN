831828,story,,,1,3,aquarius,"Can TUNIX be used as a guide for writing an operating system ?",,"Dear friends,\n       Ive gathered the following information regarding TUNIX and I have found a link to this book with respect to TUNIX : \nhttp://www.alibris.com/booksearch.detail?invid=9970583309&qwork=4865440&qsort=&page=1<p>Tunix:<p>Tunix is a small linux distribution/toolkit, intended to teach and show how to gather opensource projects, what parts are needed, what methods can be employed and as a result, have a bootable linux distribution which fits in a single disk or CF card.<p>Tunix is a set of tools used to generate small bootable Linux images. It can be used to learn how to roll your own distribution, or to port embedded systems. The basic release uses busybox and has a kernel with netfilter-enabled modules. A uclibc iptables binary is included, so you can roll your small firewall from a floppy.<p>Kindly enlighten me regarding the above query !!<p>Thanks !",1253354031

Whether that will be good or bad is  unknown, often irrespective of intentions, and can only be evaluated through value-judgement.<p>If that's your belief, currently, I can't fault it.",1253353323

831809,comment,831533,831533,0,0,kickstand,,,"The ""private beta"" approach seems like a great idea for sites that require or encourage a form of registration. I'm glad it's working out for you Travis.  My problem is that my app is more casual than that--registration is maybe a phase 2 or 3 feature for me, the site is more of an information resource and I don't want to ask visitors to register for that up front.<p>I like the idea of a ""sneak peek"" splash page, as vyrotek suggests. It's a good alternative to ""private beta"" for registration-free sites. But I'm expecting visitors not to enter the site via the homepage but by one of the informational pages (discovered via Google, etc.), which means most visitors won't be coming through the front door.  Still, I think this might be a good approach if I can figure out how to present it.",1253351591

831805,comment,830571,830786,0,0,listic,,,"Do you actually use it much? Do you have to open documents written by others, in MS Office?<p>I work for a small engineering and instrument making company. I suggested trying OpenOffice in a company, it was carefully considered and rejected, and there are reasons for it:<p>1. Some of the documents we get from partners who write them in MS Word just don't open right. The company can't afford this, period.<p>2. OpenOffice Calc doesn't have compound filtering, like MS Excel. I.e. you filter column by one parameter, then by another. In Excel it is compound filtering: you select list of parts that satisfies the condition1 AND condition2, in OpenOffice Calc the condition2 just replaces the condition1. Maybe it's even more _right_, maybe the behaviour of MS Office is just a gimmick - I don't know, but the fact is that a guy who manages inventory of parts in our company came to depend on the functionality of MS Office and making switch is just impractical.<p>The version of OpenOffice was 2.4 back then, but I have no reason to expect that those issues have been fixed since. OpenOffice is a nice project and helluva work, and open source is cool, but there are reasons why not everyone can use it.",1253351177

Seriously, a simple geek campaign like &quot;let&#x27;s call it the Facebook Oculus from now on&quot; would probably have a good chance at destroying the project. It&#x27;s not that I personally have anything against either FB or Oculus, but it seems like a huge business risk to everyone involved.

I tried several things to deal with it (all safe) but couldn&#x27;t get a handle on it, resulting in burnout.<p>All of those things you want to do are good; you could try doing some of them part time. When life tells you to pack up, you&#x27;ll know it, so I&#x27;m not going to prescribe anything particular, other than letting you know to trust your instincts here. I had to find out the problem was mostly me (but other people also had to go). But one thing you need to know: all the good you do cannot patch you up on the inside. Whatever you&#x27;re feeling will be there later.<p>The importance of someone who honestly balances you out cannot be understated. I did not understand balance until I had to see myself through my wife&#x27;s eyes over and over again. It&#x27;s humbling and hard, but it will change you to something healthier much quicker. I don&#x27;t know what your relationship looks like, but I hope your girlfriend builds you up and supports you whatever your mood is.<p>Personally, I have to always be learning.

Some companies&#x27; data science teams are doing work that could be done in Excel, and others are doing sophisticated machine learning research. In many companies, though, it&#x27;s a watered-down version of the (extinct, sadly) R&D job description. I&#x27;ve heard people opine that 95% of &quot;data scientists&quot; have never implemented anything more sophisticated than an SGD regression, and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me.<p>Granted, you can get some neat insights and visualizations with off-the-shelf tools, but I still consider it important to know how the algorithms actually work and what the basic assumptions are. For example, you can <i>usually</i> use linear regression for 2-class classification problems (as opposed to the mathematically more correct logistic model, since probabilities are in [0, 1] and linear models diverge at the boundary) get a reasonable predictive model, but it&#x27;s worth knowing when (and why) that short-cut breaks down.<p>In software, you hear &quot;data scientist syndrome&quot; used to describe people who have a lot of short job tenures because they (a) leave if there isn&#x27;t interesting work for them, and (b) tend to be the first laid off, not because they&#x27;re bad but because R&D is first to bleed when things go bad. The software industry forces you to choose between short-term job security (people doing interesting work are most exposed to organizational changes) and long-term career health (people <i>not</i> doing interesting work turn into dinosaurs). It stands to reason that the selection process for organizational credibility (favoring tenure) would be something other than deep knowledge of data science (which requires a stream of interesting work, and the behavioral correlates such as job volatility).<p>It&#x27;s sad that the typical corporate culture of reliable mediocrity, at the expense of excellence, has also learned to use the vocabulary of &quot;Big Data&quot;. Reality: truly Big Data (> 10 TB) is a huge pain in the ass.

If memory serves me correctly, in the early aughts it was discovered that Ford Crown Vic (and the same-model Mercury Grand Marquis&#x27;) were exploding due to rear impact collisions.  The problem was severely overblown in the media, and the reality was that the significant uptick in real-impact explosions of these models was due to the fact that these were cars used by police around the globe, and hence had a higher probability of being parked on the side of the road and, hence, a higher probability of being impacted from behind at high speed and sometimes exploding due to the gas tank being ruptured.<p>So, like Tesla, Ford tried to explain, &quot;Look, if you take <i>any</i> car and park it on the side of the road and it gets slammed into, from behind, at high speed, it has a chance of exploding.  These cars are parked on the road more often than other cars as emergency service vehicles&quot;.<p>But, nobody wanted to hear that (which I agree with), so Ford set about solving the problem through engineering.  They ended up developing some sort of impact resistant gas tank bladder.  Case closed.<p>So, TL;DR: try not to compare the issues that Tesla faces to those of much (<i>much</i>) larger companies.

But, it&#x27;s a terrible approach.  If one doesn&#x27;t &#x27;tough it out&#x27;, one is viewed as weak, and this often leads to self-medicating and other related illnesses.<p>But, let&#x27;s try a simple experiment to determine rough odds of &#x27;toughing it out&#x27;.  Let&#x27;s say that someone reads this who has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, bipolar, or similar illnesses.  That person should count the number of people in their extended family (these illnesses frequently have genetic components).  Then, of that group, they should count the number who have had highly stable, productive, and predictable lives.  Divide the latter by the former, and check: is the percentage low or high?  If one has 12 people in their extended family, and 8 of the 12 haven&#x27;t lived amazing lives, well the odds probably aren&#x27;t great for them to &#x27;tough it out&#x27;.<p>Some of us come from families who are quite intelligent but who just can&#x27;t keep their shit together, otherwise.

If any of that exists, it&#x27;s managed to stay completely off the mainstream computing radar, which is a pity given the number of smart people who&#x27;ve poured considerably amounts of time into it.<p>As an example: a lot of the RDF community hated schema.org when it was announced because it used HTML5 microdata instead. If you were a web developer, the case for microdata was easy: add a couple of simple HTML attributes, use one of multiple high-quality validators to test your markup, and Google/Bing/etc. would return better search results for your data. At the same time, it was daunting to write an RDFa equivalent because there were no complete, current, non-contradictory docs and examples, the W3C validator had been broken for over a year (it was at least up, unlike all of the other online validators) and nothing actually supported it so you&#x27;d be investing hours or days instead of minutes in the hope that at some point in the future it would become useful. Most people with jobs to do are just going to wait until the demand side of that equation is more favorable.<p>The best example of linked data in widespread usage is Facebook&#x27;s Open Graph markup but it appears that almost everyone simply stops as soon as they get the desired results in Facebook and, predictably, almost none of the examples actually validate because of tooling and cultural issues.",1396102388

I&#x27;m currently working in FX, but am enjoying  learning about equity research in my evenings and weekends.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve been thinking of a slight change in the direction of my career - the most concise way I can say it is that I&#x27;d like the code to become more of a tool than the end product. Equity research, and ultimately portfolio management interest me a great deal.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if anybody has the experience to advise how I can begin to make this change, or where I should look for positions? I would love to move to a buy side firm in the next few years if possible. I&#x27;ve begun to study for the IMC exam also. Many job postings I&#x27;ve seen even for junior equity analysts require much more business experience and a different academic background. What kind of firms should I be looking at?<p>Any help or advice would be appreciated :)",1396102109

7492249,comment,7488554,7492199,2,0,mercurial,,,"As somebody who spent some years writing Perl code, I don&#x27;t feel that having a few well-defined ASCII symbols were such an issue. The problems with Perl are that symbols change depending on the context (eg, an array @items needs to be accessed via $items[$i] to get an item at position $i, to tell Perl it is a scalar context), and weak typing. Even with changing symbols, it makes it easier to distinguish between scalars, arrays and hashes, especially with syntax highlighting. As opposed to languages like Haskell or Scala, in which library designers are free to display their creativity with such immediately obvious operators as &#x27;$$+-&#x27;.<p>Edited to add that I agree with your overall point. Shorter is not always clearer. It can be a benefit to have a few Unicode symbols displayed via &#x27;conceal&#x27; but it&#x27;s not (at least in my experience) a major productivity gain. And the number needs to be kept small. If I want Unicode symbol soup, I&#x27;ll play a roguelike.",1396102036

I would use Bespin if it was polished, it's open source too.<p>I'm not concerned about the difference between cloud based or desktop based as far as storage. We're backing up everything to github, dropbox anyway, it would be nice to have local storage as well obviously.<p>The real difference between Bespin and TextMate, Espresso, Coda is performance. Text editors better be fast, Bespin is not there yet. Maybe it's hard to get good performance with HTML5 for this, but the example of TextMate, where people begged for a Windows port, shows it might be worth it. Relying on OS makers to keep improving OS developer APIs is a bad idea, everyone is focusing on light mobile OSs and browsers. It's sad to see great desktop apps become abandonware.<p>Source control GUI for github, FTP, easy deployment to various cloud services that support various languages, VMs would be nice. More importantly, adding features through plugin systems should be a snap. I had this idea where code can be organized in many different ways. CommandFactory belongs to Commands and Factories, but it becomes annoying to browse through deeply nested folders. Code should be organized by tags, not folders. Code inside a file could get tags too, so you can click those instead of scrolling. Don't know if today's IDEs could support this, but the plugin systems seem too complicated anyway.",1281224870

The most relevant example here is IBM, which almost didn't survive the 80s until they emphasized more system integration.<p>As humanity progresses, demands will change. Microsoft has enough power, both in terms of number of employees and in cash, to pursue more than one option. Hence, many of the innovation coming from Microsoft Research can be very useful in the future. Moreover, one of the main advantages for Microsoft in the 80s and 90s was that they are friendly to developers. Of course there will eventually be a tie-in. You start using IronRuby, then you find ready .Net solutions to your programming, then you commit to using their database, and maybe visualisation via Excel, and you find yourself and your customers tied to the Windows/Office platform. Just like many companies are tied to IE6 despite what Microsoft wants and despite common sense.<p>Give developers no incentives at all, and they wander around. At some point, the clear division in tools makes people either commit to Microsoft or to everything else, and when Windows come short (and it will, nothing is forever) people will move in droves. But give them a semblance of cross compatibility, and they will stick to Windows/Office while convincing themselves that there is always a way out. In reality, they will be locked by the economics of rewriting all the use of .Net technologies.<p>Bad for the community, because splitting the community into Microsoft and others camps will lessen competition in both sides. Cross pollination will C# and Ruby will not exist when there is no shared community. And no improvements will be needed in either camp because of new features in the other.",1281224746

1584576,comment,1582582,1584536,0,0,Mz,,,"<i>We need a word different than ""homeless"", really.</i><p><i>Today we've pretty much solved the basic home problem in the civilized world.</i><p>----------------<p>Some data on American housing and such, that may not be 100% accurate but should paint a general picture:<p>Around 60 years ago, the average new home was about 1200 sq ft and housed a family of 5 (2 parents, 3 kids).  Today, it is over 2000 sq ft and houses a family of 3 (2 parents, 1 kid). This difference and other factors has helped create a widening gap between the haves and have-nots:  Those who can afford a new home live like kings.  Those who can't may be perpetually one paycheck away from homelessness.  Most of the financing instruments we have are aimed at single family suburban homes designed to meet the needs of a 1950's-style nuclear family.  Meanwhile, our demographics have changed and very few people fit that bill.  The housing industry has been terribly slow to adapt to the changing needs of our changing demographics.<p>Also, historically, it was more common to live with extended family.  This was more manageable back when more than half the American population lived and worked on a farm.  You could always put someone to work on the farm to help cover the cost of feeding and housing them.  But a more city-centric lifestyle means that if you have no job, you typically aren't viewed as a contributing member of the household and it is much harder for people to extend generosity in that regard unless they are truly wealthy.  We also had more SRO housing and boarding houses -- just the sort of supportive environment that the Murray's of the world seem to need.  This was part and parcel of the culture and was not considered some kind of ""special service"" for problem individuals who couldn't adapt.  It was also cheaper than a stand-alone apartment.  Apartments designed for a nuclear family or houses designed for a nuclear family make up the majority of housing stock in the US and it is financially out of reach for many single individuals.  College students often get multiple roommates to make it work but it really isn't designed to work for them.  The Murray's of the world lack the ability to force the current housing situation to serve them adequately and mostly don't have other options which did exist not that many decades ago.<p>I have a lot more thoughts and information on the subject but I don't care to beat it to death.  The current housing situation really is a factor in why homelessness has been on the rise in recent years.  Yes, it is one of many.  But I don't think it can be lightly dismissed.",1281224545

1584536,comment,1582582,1583822,0,0,jerf,,,"We need a word different than ""homeless"", really. You say: ""Homelessness is a state that encapsulates far more problems than just the lack of a house."" But the word itself dates from a time when many people truly were simply <i>homeless</i>, and the concept itself of course predates English. Historically speaking (going back a ways, but covering a lot of centuries) one popular way to homelessness was simply to become a widow and lose your husband. (Which is why the Old Testament goes on at length about taking care of widows; it's not about having emotional compassion for one who lost their spouse, though that won't hurt, it's about supporting someone who now has no economic income.) Civilization has not always been as wealthy as it is now; someone says ""homeless"" and the very word itself invites them to think the old, simple case, not the modern complicated stuff you talk about.<p>Today we've pretty much solved the basic home problem in the civilized world. Perhaps not 100%, but nothing is ever solved 100%. What's left are the hard cases, which is what you are describing. Our cultural attitudes haven't updated for this fact, and so when people hear about the homelessness problem they naturally think the problem is simply... homelessness. Unfortunately it's a harder problem than that, and we make it even harder by misunderstanding it.",1281222369

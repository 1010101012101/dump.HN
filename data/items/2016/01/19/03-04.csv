We&#x27;re a tiny company in New Jersey whose been around in some form or another for the last 25 years, supplying remote telemetry units (RTUs) to the industrial assets industry. Helium, oxygen, nitrogen, whatever, on boats, trucks, and static sites. We also provide a monitoring platform which is where I come in. We&#x27;re a very uncool Apple - vertically integrated, we design, build, manufacture, ship, and program all of our RTUs in-house. IoT has been around for a long long time now - a lot of our work comes from clients who can&#x27;t maintain their old systems anymore.<p>The entire hype wave of IoT has more or less passed right over us. Nobody has heard our name, save for the gas industry itself. But that industry is about to (not literally) explode. Helium is an extremely lucrative industry and is growing by the minute, and there&#x27;s really nobody in this space but us. Remote monitoring - IoT - has never been more critical to helium than it has now. Without going into too much detail, knowing the pressure levels of your tank 24/7 can save you <i>a lot</i> of money.<p>So where do I come in? Our platform is written in C#, with the front-end done in Silverlight. I&#x27;m the dude getting us off it with some really hip JS work in React. Before that I wrote a lot of microservices to handle various aspects of our system. We were in a pretty bad state when I got there so I spent a lot of time improving our development team. We didn&#x27;t have PRs for a long time. For a first job out of college, it&#x27;s not bad. I get to do a lot of cool work, and on my current project I&#x27;ve made every technical decision. But sometimes I wish that we could attract better talent. Oh well, I&#x27;m (hopefully) leaving soon.",1453175890

The library uses a sexp-based format for regexes, but you can also use plain regex if you want. When you pass a plain regex to it, it will always parse it into the sexp form first. This gives you the benefit of both the compact standard regex form as well as the more readable sexp forms at the same time. For example:<p><pre><code>    (cl-ppcre:parse-string &quot;(?<!\\w)([*_])(.+?)\\1(?!\\w)&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nGives the following:<p><pre><code>    (:SEQUENCE\n      (:NEGATIVE-LOOKBEHIND :WORD-CHAR-CLASS)\n      (:REGISTER (:CHAR-CLASS #\* #\_))\n      (:REGISTER (:NON-GREEDY-REPETITION 1 NIL :EVERYTHING)) \n      (:BACK-REFERENCE 1)\n      (:NEGATIVE-LOOKAHEAD :WORD-CHAR-CLASS))\n</code></pre>\nThis may look complicated, but it has to be in order to be able to fully cover all features of standard regex.

Seeing my son getting excited about his &#x27;world state changing&#x27; gave me an idea. What if the main thing that holds us back is the reliance on cost functions? Human, and to some extent, animal intelligence is the only intelligence we know about. If that&#x27;s what we want to emulate, why don&#x27;t we try modelling <i>emotions</i> as the basic building blocks that drive the AI forward? Until now, the way I understand neuronal nets, we have basically modelled the neurons and gave them something to do. My hunch is that brain chemistry is what&#x27;s driving us actually forward, so what if we model that as well? Instead of seratonin, endorphin etc. we could also look at it at a higher level, akin to Pixar&#x27;s Inside Out - joy, fear, sadness, disgust, anger, and I would add boredom.<p>Let&#x27;s stay with video games for a bit. What if we look at joy as &#x27;seeing the world change&#x27;, graded by the degree of indirection from our inputs (the longer it cascades, the more joy it gets). Maybe let it have preference for certain color tones and sounds, because that&#x27;s also how games give us hints about whether what we do is good or not. Boredom is what sets us on a timer - too many repetitions of the same thing and the AI gets bored. Fear and disgust is something that comes out of evolutionary processes, so it might be best to add a GA in there that couples success with some fear like emotion. Anger, well, maybe wait with that ;-).<p>Edit: Oh, and for the love of god, please <i>airgap</i> the thing at all times...",1453175684

10928771,comment,10926038,10928494,0,0,dTal,,,"And yet Scheme hasn&#x27;t turned into something like that. There&#x27;s a limit to how radical a syntax you can achieve using (define-syntax), and there&#x27;s no provision for modularity. Worse still, syntax definitions are &quot;imperative&quot; - it&#x27;s really hard to see what they do by looking at them.<p>I&#x27;d like to see a system where you have tiny, composable pieces of syntax written declaratively in a domain specific language that&#x27;s as terse and general as possible - stuff like &quot;a[n] -> (list-ref a n)&quot; and &quot;a..b -> (iota a b)&quot;. You want to make it as easy as possible to port language concepts to the system. Most of the wacky semantics you can get in other languages can be had in Scheme through some sort of library already, they&#x27;re just usually kind of a pain in the ass to use without the syntax. Then making the language of your dreams is just a matter of enabling all the syntax you like. You&#x27;d need some kind of mechanism for handling grammar conflicts.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s really hard. &quot;Syntax&quot; masks a lot of complexity. A feature I want, for instance, is to have the whole language behave like a CAS, where instead of bombing out on an undefined symbol it just computes as much as it can symbolically and hands it back to you e.g. &quot;x+2+3&quot; returns &quot;x+5&quot; if x isn&#x27;t defined. That sort of thing has been done in Scheme of course, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine a syntax specification language that would let you just turn that on as a single &quot;feature&quot; without massively affecting basic things like expression parsing grammar.",1453175632

10928767,comment,10925141,10925141,0,0,ColinDabritz,,,"I enjoyed the article, although I disagreed on some minor points, some of the broad strokes seem solid to me. Very thought provoking.<p>I think it&#x27;s interesting to contrast the thrust of the article with Ward Cunningham&#x27;s original definition of technical debt:\n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqeJFYwnkjE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqeJFYwnkjE</a><p>Wards definition is much more about the differences between the current implementation of the software and your understanding of the problem, particularly as your understanding changes over time.<p>He explicitly says that &quot;tehcnical debt&quot; is NOT an excuse to write known-to-be-poor code, which is why I disagree with the //TOBECLEANED approach.<p>This change in perspective shifts the point of view quite a bit. In some ways this problem defines a startup, your biggest problem is that you don&#x27;t understand your problem. It&#x27;s somewhat likely that you won&#x27;t even have the same problem you&#x27;ll successfully solve later. The first points are salient here, focus your engineering efforts on the things you don&#x27;t understand yet, and the minimum support it needs to be viable. Shorten your feedback loop as you navigate the things you do not yet understand.<p>In this light, a startup is actively SEEKING technical debt, because it represents gaining understanding about a problem, and exploring that space quickly. This doesn&#x27;t mean you have to &quot;cut corners&quot; and do things you know to be flawed, but it suggests focusing on small &#x27;forays&#x27; into the unknown, gaining understanding quickly, and being willing to throw away your exploration for a new one if it isn&#x27;t working. Then once you find a problem you start to understand and seems like a viable direction, you have a body of &#x27;technical debt&#x27; that is the work you need to do to bring the software to your new growing understanding.<p>It seems like being willing to throw away the exploration if the direction isn&#x27;t working out is a key advantage of a startup, along with the quick iteration times and lean support for explorations. This is why I dislike the suggestions of writing known-bad code. You&#x27;re slowing your exploration down, but you aren&#x27;t gaining understanding of the problem. It&#x27;s junk debt, not technical debt. You can carefully minimize the supporting infrastructure your exploration requires, and avoid writing extra code, but you can&#x27;t just slap it together.<p>It&#x27;s not enough to flail around building as fast as you can, you have to deliberately learn and explore problems and understanding as you go, and evaluate which ones to put more exploration into and which to abandon. To me, this is the core work of a startup that differentiates it from established companies who are executing on a reasonably well understood problem. The (sometimes gradual) transition happens when you stop exploring, and start focusing on clearing the technical debt from your current exploration.<p>Thanks for sharing the article, I enjoyed engaging with these ideas!",1453175583

10928762,comment,10926038,10926038,0,0,mikekchar,,,"This may be a strange way of looking at it, but let&#x27;s backtrack 30 years before and see what made the biggest differences.  As I&#x27;ve been in the industry for about thirty years, my impression is that nothing much has changed.  That seems strange, but it&#x27;s still the same job that I started with.<p>For me it is interesting that in my career, code base sizes grew to gigantic proportions -- there are many applications that are 10s of millions of lines of code.  In the middle of my career I worked on a few.  Interestingly, I&#x27;m doing web development now and a lot of my colleagues think that 5000 lines is unbearably big.  I think the take-away here is that we have gotten slightly better at abstracting things out and using development libraries (and dare I say, frameworks).<p>OO was just becoming a big thing at the start of my career.  Everybody did it incredibly badly.  Then Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham came along and told people how to do it not-so-badly.  I think the biggest thing that I saw in this time frame was the breaking of the myths of OO being about code re-use, and the movement away from huge brittle design structures.  Good OO developers moved back to the really basic ideals of dealing with coupling and cohesion in design.  We even started to have a language to be able to discuss design intelligently.  Of course, quite a huge number of people were oblivious to this, but it always struck me how amazing it was that Beck and Cunningham were really 15 years ahead of most of the rest of us.<p>Lately, functional programming is coming into vogue.  For the second time in my career I was surprised.  People in the know are talking about idempotence, and immutable structures.  This was the stuff that the crazy people were talking about in the 80&#x27;s -- stuff that was &quot;too slow&quot;, and &quot;too memory intensive&quot; to take seriously.  But now it&#x27;s pretty obvious this is the way to go.<p>I think the other big thing that blew me away in the last 30 years was testing.  Probably some people will remember pre-conditions, post-conditions, and class invariants.  This was unfortunately forgotten by most, but the most astonishing thing was unit testing.  Especially the practice of Test Driven Development that not only allowed you to document your code with executable examples, but also forced you to decouple your objects/modules by the very behaviour that creates the documentation.  Very few people do this well (just like most of the other things I&#x27;ve mentioned), but it is completely game changing.<p>As for the future, what is coming up?  I suggest you look at what has gone before you for hints to that.  In the last 30 years, apart from TDD (which came completely out of the blue as far as I could tell), the major advancements came from stuff we already knew about.  It was the stuff that the &quot;crazy&quot; people advocated in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s, but that seemed impractical.  If I were to guess, I suspect that we will see further progress on decoupling in design.  Immutable data structures will not just be common, they will be how ever professional designs code.  As performance moves from single processing to multi-processing, this will be important.  Look at innovative ways of processing like flow based processing and other crazy ideas from bygone years.<p>My last piece of advice: Don&#x27;t look for large revolutionary changes.  I think those are unlikely.  The programmer of 30 years from now will probably still be doing the same job as I am today.  The changes will be much more qualitative.  Also, expect that the vast majority of programmers will be as oblivious to the advancements as most programmers are today.",1453175501

Imagine an America where grandparents (and great-grandparents if any) live with one of their children&#x27;s family. Assuming an average of two children per grandparent, it will be half of the households will have 2 children, 2 parents, and 2 grandparents, and the other half the traditional nuclear family. The nursing home infrastructure will be much reduced because only the childless will live in them. It can reduce the liability on social security. This can be countered with tax cuts to children who are working to support their parents. Implement a law where elderly parents can sue their children for parental support, to cover cases where children do not care about their parents. A society that cherishes the dignity of dying at home surrounded by friends and family as opposed to enduring 3 months of humiliating treatment before dying violent death surrounded by nurses, will reduce healthcare costs. Grandparents will also reduce the labor requirement for childcare, and also provide guidance and teaching during times when parents are too busy working from day to night. In the case of widows and widowers, and single parents, grandparents can increase the chance a child grow up with a role model of their own gender. Being supported by adult children means even in the case when a 50 year old parent loses their job due to ageism, they will not be forced to live on their streets; With some frugality it should be possible for a pair of children to support their parents and grandparents living in the same home. These dynamics will reduce the pressure on the government budget, increase social capital, increase the sense of belonging, reduce the dependency for &quot;a job&quot; even when you&#x27;re 50+, reduce the cost of housing by reducing demand, and by sharing furniture and other goods, reduce household expenditure. A 50 year old unemployed couple will be able to converse and socialise with their retired 75 year old parent(s) as a day-to-day activity.<p>And when you&#x27;re spending time with people, in a house with a family, with clean water, sufficient food, electricity and internet access, with regular social gatherings, can you really be said to be in &quot;lonely poverty&quot;?<p>That said, all this is physically, economically possible today, but it is probably not politically or socially possible.

They see it as just another cost of manufacturing--a line item on the BOM just like screws and sheet metal. In order to move these widgets onto store shelves, we need to source these parts, assemble them with these steps, test the electronics like so, environmental, stress, UL testing and, oh, by the way, we need to spoon in some of this software stuff or nothing shows up on the screen, but keep it cheap! It&#x27;s almost seen as a nuisance, a necessary evil: Just slap something together so we can get on with our real business of shipping widgets.

Overall people are better off now than ever before. Yes, there are problems now, but there have always been problems. 25 years ago, the internet was unknown to the general public. Housing is more expensive, but food and clothing are cheaper, something these statements usually ignore. Civil rights for women and minorities are better - advances there far outweigh erosion in places like intellectual property. The further back you go, the better life is today. Remember when women were legally paid less than men for identical jobs? Remember being conscripted against your will? Remember when being visibly pregnant in public was a source of shame? Remember when you had to ensure you had all your food shopping done by a certain time, because shops were only half open on Saturdays and not open at all on Sunday? Remember how expensive appliances were, and that you actually had to take the time to go into the store to talk about the issue rather than ring a number or look online? Remember how time-locked (and expensive!) entertainment was, and none of it was &#x27;on-demand&#x27;? Remember the fear of living under the nuclear umbrella and Mutually Assured Destruction? This last one has been replaced somewhat by nebulous &#x27;terrorism&#x27;, but the fear of our western democracies being literally overrun by a terrorist military doesn&#x27;t really compare.<p>Remember when &#x27;good job&#x27; meant &#x27;regular pay packet&#x27;, and not &#x27;comfortable work in an office that you like&#x27;?

Moreover, these were designed by humans with very explicit successes, losses and easily distinguishable outcomes.<p>None of these descriptions fit the kind of control that an &#x27;intelligent&#x27; system needs to handle.

I believe the price they&#x27;re trying to charge is simply an order of magnitude out of whack with reality.<p>I suspect there are 2 factors at play here. For one, serving the lowest common denominator and competing on price is easier. It&#x27;s easier to create metrics around, and by handling volume, it&#x27;s easier to fill planes. It would be harder to provide a premium service airline with all more-expensive seats, because likely they&#x27;d end up with unexpectedly low utilization or unexpectedly high demand at various times, based on seasonality, and it might be harder to fill all of the seats as efficiently. Not to mention route planning and so on.<p>The other factor is probably just a bit of a herd mentality where nobody wants to go out on a limb and try something different for fear of spectacular failure. We know the existing system works, even if it doesn&#x27;t work well.<p>I know United has Premium Service, but they don&#x27;t even make it easy to purchase.

I think a major change in service for your most frequently-used route is pretty significant, and I&#x27;d expect anyone to switch airlines for this. I was speaking more of small changes that would likely go unnoticed, eg if one airline offers upgrades to frequent fliers slightly more often than another; that might go unnoticed, and even if it didn&#x27;t, likely would not trump loyalty due to existing miles, preferable routes, preferred lounges/service of one airline over another, etc.<p>Your suggestion of &quot;upgrading&quot; yourself is not realistic for 2 reasons. One, very few people will pay 5x as much for a slightly better experience. The price difference vastly exceeds the actual cost (except to the extent that premium seats subsidize coach seats, of course).<p>Secondly, my comment was about the customer goodwill the occasional upgrade would generate, as lowly infrequent fliers do not expect to be treated as anything but breathing, inconvenient cargo.<p>You say that people who spend as much time in the air as you DO care, but you also said you don&#x27;t use upgrades, and you changed airlines over a major service change, not over a minor upgrade policy change.

The problem is that Peach&#x27;s server side authorisation token does not expire when you &#x27;log out&#x27; and you can reuse the token.<p>The issue is mainly got to do with third party apps + this flaw in Peach&#x27;s API. There is already one[0] which has reversed the Peach API, and the flaw is still present. What happens when another third-party Peach app comes out and does not use SSL, you can still use Peach&#x27;s API without SSL and it does not default to HTTPS.<p>This sort of flaw would lead to a similar issue to the Snapsaved leak[1].<p>[0] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/14/peach-gets-an-unofficial-web-and-android-version-called-nectarine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/14/peach-gets-an-unofficial-we...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/13/snapsaved-takes-responsibility-for-latest-snapchat-leak/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/13/snapsaved-takes-responsibil...</a>",1453172603

Someone who has never even looked at a computer will have a hard time playing Skyrim or any other video game without many hours of practice. And, most video games draw upon stuff that humans already know, like moving around in a physical world, and a concept of self, which gives them a huge advantage over AI right from the start.",1453172402

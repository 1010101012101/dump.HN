The Windows philosophy, on the other hand, is basically that every user should be a half-competent sysadmin in their own right.<p>Windows has never been, is not, and never will be, for ""simple users."" It is for power-users, and those with power-users in their support networks. Unix was designed for ""simple users"" from day one, but under the simple rule that there be someone else around whose only task is to take care of the system.<p>I've always wondered why computer repair shops don't offer a service where they continue on as root of any repaired computers....",1189583150

Money, companies, and everything else comes and goes, but it's important to have someone who will always be there.<p>That said, it affects  your ability to do a startup, because you have something that's more important.  Oh well, I wouldn't trade it for anything!",1189582657

53741,comment,53708,53708,0,0,paul,,,"There's no reason why ""geeks"" can't understand these other topics as well (and likewise, people from other backgrounds can learn to code). I don't like pigeonholing people and expecting them to only be good at one thing.<p>If you can understand both sides of the equation, that's a huge advantage. Technology is still very important, and people who don't understand it are going to have (or cause) problems.",1189582205

Most things are a lot easier easy than with Windows, and most importantly, security updates take care of themselves, too. Under windows it is just big mess. Usually applications come with their own updater software, which is ugly and spyware-ish by itself, and also very unreliable.",1189580905

U.S. cities, for the most part, may not be as easy to do something like kettling in as most are less dense than U.K. cities and may simply have more open space to cover to effectively ""kettle"" people and contain them to one area. Also, although the police are clearly acting as if they are militants at war, they still don't want the non-protesting population to feel as if they are under martial law so sectioning off a large part of a city with police in riot gear and chasing protestors around to where everyone sees this going on would probably hurt their cause more than help it.",1325454958

One reviewer suggested that I expand on a bit that went something like, ""Create a new project in Xcode"" with a step-by-step along the lines of, ""1. Open Xcode and pull down the File menu...."" This seemed to be well below the level I was aiming for, but of course I could never get anyone at Apress to tell me who they agreed with.<p>The copy editor was decent but not technically minded, so I had to explain a fair amount. I imagine that technically-minded copy editors are hard to come by, but still, this is a technical press.... The copy editing <i>process</i> was atrocious. I had to download some crazy Adobe software to review the suggested changes, and for some reason they do the indexing <i>before</i> these final changes, so I had to ensure that any alterations didn't reflow pages too much.<p>When I self published, I ended up crowdsourcing people for these functions by recruiting on my blog and on Twitter. I got a couple of dozen fairly competent people and we were able to divide up the book so that nobody had to do more than a couple of chapters. (Some ended up doing much more, but simply because they wanted to.) That ended up working pretty well, although obviously not every prospective author will have the ability to recruit a couple of dozen helpers like that.",1325453270

Consumer software is easy to explain, you can share it immediately with your friends, and you get to apply both technical and design skills. Business-to-business software is well and good, but there's a reason why we aren't writing automated trading platforms for hedge funds :) SCRUFF has been fortunate to find a market that is both growing quickly and very excited about our product. When you come on board, the code you write will affect hundreds of thousands of guys every day.<p>• Our #1 priority for you is your professional development<p>Most startups want engineers to start producing shipping code on day one. We would much rather take the time to allow you to explore our codebase, do deep dives into the technologies we use, and ultimately write great production code in weeks or months. We feel mentorship is one of the most critical aspects of enjoying your job.<p>We also strive to practice good core software engineering principles, because we believe in the long-run it will make the code you write better, bring more benefits to our members, and be most helpful for you in your career. The ideal candidate should come in with a healthy ego and a positive attitude, be open to critical feedback, and be eager to develop more in the practice of professional software development.<p>• You will touch every piece of code we have.<p>Our engineering team is small. There are no client-side/server-side functional divides. You will be responsible for the servers (we have a lot). You will be responsible for the client (iOS and Android). Your brain will be stretched in new and confounding ways. But in the process you will build a set of skills that will form the core of all software innovation of the next 10 years. What we teach you at SCRUFF about mobile development will be like learning HTML in 1995 or GUI programming in 1985.<p>• Parties are our business, and now they're yours, too.<p>No, seriously. Lots of startups will talk about their Friday night beer busts, but at SCRUFF we take it to a new level. SCRUFF partners with promoters and events all across the world. As a SCRUFF team member, you will become part of the SCRUFF brand, and will have opportunities to represent us at events both locally and across the country.<p>• New York City.<p>SCRUFF is based in Manhattan, the most amazing city in the world. Everyone you've ever met will want to come and visit. Your other friends who work at banks will complain to you about their schedules while you are busy planning SCRUFF parties into your workday(night?) Startup networking events will be blocks away, every day. You'll have access to the most restaurants, the most culture, and an endless stream of new people to meet. We love New York, and think you will love it too.<p>Read more at <a href=""http://www.scruffapp.com/join"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scruffapp.com/join</a>",1325452676

I can't speak for everyone, but what I like about the IOS gaming experience is I can quickly and conveniently take out my device for short bursts. I can't imagine waiting for a meeting and pulling out a controller. In most circumstances if I wanted a controller experience, I think I'd rather wait to play on my console. The problem here isn't that this is a dumb invention, it's not, it's really cool, and I applaud the hack, but I question if this is the ""missing link"" when there are fantastic and well controlled games already available on this platform.",1325452495

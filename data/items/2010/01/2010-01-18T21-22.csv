Therefore, we are a lot less interested by the ""technical achievement"" and we would like the application to become really useful.
However, two main barriers must be eliminated in order to get people to switch to our product (I encourage you to read Joel Spolsky’s great post about barriers: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000052.html):
   1. The learning curve of the application needs to be shortened. Some concepts that we use are powerful but they are not intuitive to novice users. 
     - A menu button and the elements it contains can have 4 states (Up, Over, Down, DownOver).
     - A menu button can be linked to a Selected Canvas and/or an Over Canvas.  If the mouse is over the button, the linked over canvas is displayed. If the menu button is down, the selected canvas linked to the menu is displayed. Otherwise they are hidden.
     - Elements can be docked inside one another (left, top, right..).<p><pre><code>   2. The average user is not a designer. He does not know exactly what he wants (something beautiful...) and he needs to be guided when building a banner.
</code></pre>
In order to remove these two barriers, we intend to build more templates and to add wizards.<p>We would love to hear your feedback about the way to make Illuminator a real useful application.",1263851306

I'm somewhat surprised that you went through this at a tech company, so I guess ""big"" is an important factor.<p>Initially I thought that as with my high school programming job, I'd learn a lot at work. I also bought into a certain sense of obligation: ""I'm salaried, so work doesn't stop after 8 hours a day!"" I came to realize that work wouldn't be completely intellectually fulfilling, and that I value intellectual growth over corporate loyalty. I decided to explicitly dedicate time for intellectual advancement apart from my regular job responsibilities.<p>So, my first antidote to intellectual stagnation was to apply for tuition reimbursement and enroll as a part-time grad student. I made arrangements to work half days on MWF or take very long lunches TT. Real-life lectures are better than online ones because you can ask questions, and the homeworks and exams are very helpful for giving you an objective reference on your progress.<p>That didn't help my salary or my future job prospects (as far as I can tell), but I'm very glad I did it. I think it worked out well for my employer during that time, too, because it kept me happy enough stick around at a lowish salary for a couple years when I was performing very well but not feeling very challenged at work.<p>The second thing is that I maintained my ACM membership and read Queue and CACM. I think that helps me to stay somewhat aware of the progress of the field. I've used the digital library several times to help me with particularly thorny programming problems at work.<p>Finally, if you're not doing new stuff at work, try to motivate yourself to do something new at home. Maybe you just implement an algorithm you read about from CACM Research Highlights or whatever, or maybe you join a programming club and volunteer to teach a topic. I think it's very important to keep doing and not just reading.",1263851058

In the specific example behind the article, what happens if one of the founders quits? The non-quitting founder is screwed because he gave up half the company equity to a dud partner and has no way to get it back. The company will probably die.<p>Actual issued shares should only go to investors with cash money, tangible assets, or founder(s) with patentable intellectual property. Everybody else (including founders who may have received actual shares for their intellectual property) should get ISOP shares whose present value, when added to their startup salary, would equal the salary they could make in the real world at an established company. The ISOP should have a small cliff so founders who quit after a few months don't get anything.<p>In my startup experience, most of them had issues like this with founders payouts not reflecting their fair contribution. In one case, the founder quit after 18 months but the company hadn't issued ISOP so he got his full cut when the company was sold in 4 years.<p>In another case, founders got stock in direct proportion to what they initially invested in the company. But they burned through the money in three months, didn't get funded, and everybody worked for free for another 12 months before they could start paying salaries. They didn't issue ISOP to make up for the non-paying period, so a founder who invested $20k and worked for free for a year got four times as much as a founder who invested $5k and worked for free for a year.",1263850307

8140228,comment,8138541,8138541,1,0,k-mcgrady,,,"Excellent article. One of the things that throws me off libertarianism is the lack of social welfare. I come from the land of free health care and education so minimal social welfare is a strange concept to me and, I say this without exaggeration, seems almost evil. However a BIG is something I would definitely go for. The reduced bureaucracy, better flexibility for people to use the money as they wish, potential economical benefits etc. are all great. I still think I&#x27;d take a reduced BIG in exchange for some sort of free health care (if we got rid of that we&#x27;d just be shifting the bureaucracy from government to insurance companies) but something where consumers have more choice and we have a more competitive market.",1407283180

8140187,comment,8137495,8139964,2,0,joepie91_,,,"> You keep implying that all jobs are just supporting the &quot;corporate&quot; entity or whatever but what does that really even mean?<p>As I said, I simplified it for the purpose of illustration. These kind of topics are incredibly complex - especially when you go outside of the conventional &quot;get a job, buy a house&quot; routine and thus lack a shared context/perspective - so describing everything accurately at once in a single comment is very hard, if not impossible. The best I can do is to keep things readable and mostly accurate, and elaborate on any points of confusion.<p>> There are plenty of non-profits that employ software developers<p>This is correct. However, they normally have a very narrow focus, which means there&#x27;s not a lot of variation. That&#x27;s an excellent way to become unproductive and unmotivated. I can simply do much more useful stuff when I&#x27;m not tied to a particular single agenda or purpose. I&#x27;m optimizing for productivity, not for social acceptance.<p>> and plenty of other businesses that provide useful/genuine services.<p>Sure, but providing useful services is not their <i>goal</i>. Making money is. The &#x27;useful services&#x27; are just an (attempted) method of getting there. If making money weren&#x27;t their goal, they wouldn&#x27;t be a commercial business - they&#x27;d be a non-profit.<p>> There is nothing inherently wrong with a corporation or business.<p>There is, but that&#x27;s quite a complex topic that goes beyond just the points mentioned here.<p>> If you are so against people working for corporations and the work that they produce, perhaps you should stop using computers and other electronics?<p>How is that a reasonable conclusion? Computers and other electronics are not something that can exclusively be produced in a commercial manner, that just happens to be how they are produced <i>right now</i>. I don&#x27;t exactly have a choice there. How does that lead to me having to stop using that technology, seeing as there is nothing wrong with the technology in itself?<p>> You just aren&#x27;t making a lot of sense here. Your reasons for not wanting to work are because it creates &quot;strings&quot; and &quot;distorted priorities&quot;.. What is distorted about earning(giving effort) and receiving a paycheck?<p>The distortion is that your goal is now that paycheck, rather than doing useful things. If a conflict ever arises between the two, that leads you to having to pick between &#x27;doing it right&#x27; or retaining your income, guess which one will win? These conflicts happen to people on a daily basis, they&#x27;re just commonly waved away or ignored through various cognitive biases.<p>A tit-for-tat type of income inevitably leads to a shift in goals. Your goal is no longer the stated purpose of what you&#x27;re doing, but rather following the wishes of whoever is bringing you that income. It creates a dependency, and not a healthy one.<p>> Its only about the most common thing across every society on earth.<p>As are corruption and dishonesty. That something is &#x27;common&#x27; doesn&#x27;t somehow make it morally justifiable or not distorted.<p>> You want people to fund you because working &quot;didn&#x27;t work out&quot; for you?<p>No, and I&#x27;ve actually been quite clear about this. I want people to fund me if they appreciate what I do. That is the difference between accepting donations (which voluntary contributions effectively are), and panhandling. I&#x27;m essentially just giving people the <i>choice</i> to compensate me for my work, rather than forcing them to do so through a commercial business model.<p>I really don&#x27;t understand the insistence you&#x27;re putting on &quot;just get a job&quot;. If the social cost vs. social benefits of my proposal are better than if I were to get a job, where is the problem?",1407282620

Within the last week there was an NHK show on this whole thing, in which it was pointed out how key Sasai was to Obokata&#x27;s paper. According to the show, the paper had already been rejected by two different outlets for shoddy writing and presentation, and Sasai was called in to clean it up - he did, Nature accepted the paper for publication, and the rest is history.<p>But several scientists NHK got to sit down on camera and read over the Nature article all said basically the same thing: &quot;Sasai sure knows how to write an attractive paper, but the contents are garbage.&quot; Things like possible flaws with the samples or data would be defacto admitted, but glossed over with a simple &quot;We checked the STAP cells to see if they were not another kind of man-made stem cell&quot; - but then never stated what the results of that check were (and it seems to have turned out the &quot;STAP&quot; cells were stem cells that for some reason Obokata had stocks of in her office).</i><p><i>These same scientists on the show were saying that if Obokata&#x27;s results could not be independently duplicated, Sasai had just destroyed his entire career and Riken itself was going to be in a world of hurt as Sasai was instrumental in getting grants and funding for them.</i><p><i>I feel bad for Sasai&#x27;s family.

I failed to mention that I&#x27;m advocating 1 process per core, not hundreds (thousands) of processes. Over subscribing processes to cores has the same effect of oversubscribing threads to cores, which is suboptimal scheduling.  Furthermore, this model allows you to easily pin work to cores (using process affinity) and to get all the juicy benefits of using cooperative scheduling inside your processes.<p>I think the view that processes are &quot;heavy weight&quot; is a dated one. From an OS point of view, processes are pretty much the same amount of &quot;work&quot; as thread. Each has a context, each needs to be scheduled. Processes do have some extra state (notably the TLB context) but modern machines are very good switching these.  Spinning up processes is somewhat more expensive than spinning up threads, but you really shouldn&#x27;t be doing either on the critical path.<p>I agree that everything is context specific, although my main application area is really low latency scenarios (handfuls of microseconds) and techniques that work well there tend to port well to slower situations pretty easily (at least in my experience).<p>I disagree that encapsulation and non-overlapping objects will save you from threading nightmares.

8140048,comment,8138578,8138578,1,0,ahelwer,,,"I was lucky enough to ask Leslie Lamport some questions about TLA+, which is a programming language of his creation based on the Temporal Logic of Actions: basically predicate logic with some reasoning about Time thrown in. With it, you specify concurrent algorithms in terms of possible state transitions and assertions which should hold in all program states (or subsets of those states). A model checker then runs through all the states, checking your assertions (this can understandably take quite a while, so there&#x27;s a distributed model checker for large systems).<p>A really good takeaway from the talk is a point he made on software testing: for sequential algorithms, conventional software testing is likely to find most of the bugs you really care about. For concurrent algorithms, however, finding those bugs through software testing is extremely unlikely; an Amazon paper on TLA+ usage[0] details a bug found which required a 35-step trace to reproduce. Given the speed of computers today, it&#x27;s only a matter of time before these bugs are hit and your system implodes in a confusing and impossible-to-reproduce way. Software testing by itself just isn&#x27;t good enough anymore.<p>[0] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/amazon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/am...</a>",1407280122

If we assert that we&#x27;re stating this sentence as an assertion or judgement of reality then we would like to evaluate its &quot;truth&quot;.

Seeing that there have been parallel versions of this algorithm implemented successfully, I can&#x27;t bring myself to throw out that tub yet.  Did they do this by removing the mutable nature of the algorithm?  Not to my knowledge.  No, instead they kept this mutable tool and built on top of it with something that is basically message passing.<p>That is, instead of throwing out the mutable tools we have, you can also segment the work you are giving out.  This isn&#x27;t exactly novel, either.  Consider anyone planning the festivities of any major event.  Timelines and work plans are par for the course.

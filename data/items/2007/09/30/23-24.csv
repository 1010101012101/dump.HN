61419,comment,61361,61398,0,0,mojuba,,,"Unfortunately this silent update itself is not the biggest issue. The history teaches us that any new feature in Windows brings another security breach with it. I'm 80% sure we'll soon have a virus that will exploit WU and will silently install itself even if your automatic updates are off.<p>(dfranke, do you read your emails? I sent you 2 emails already. Remember our conversation about SQL?)",1191196127

Food shouldn't be too much since I love to cook (no need to buy packaged food) and I'm sure there's more than a couple cheap farmers markets in the bay area.  The more money we can put into operating the business, the better.",1191195855

61416,comment,61222,61355,0,0,dcurtis,,,"You mean Steve Jobs didn't pound it into your head by saying it 50 times at Macworld? The iPhone isn't a phone. It's a ""revolutionary phone,"" an ""amazing ipod,"" and an ""internet communication device.""<p>Also, it's not just a pretty UI. It is a pretty UI, but it represents a complete change in mobile device interaction. They took touch technology and they did it right for the first time. That's definitely a shift in the paradigm, and it will certainly change the mobile space forever. <p>Also, by introducing the first usable/decent web browser for mobile devices, they've hopefully inspired other traditionally crappy companies like Nokia and SonyEricsson and Palm to do the same. Man, I hope so.",1191195080
61415,comment,61222,61307,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Yeah, you might have those problems, but believe it or not, Apple's quality control has actually gone up.<p>I had a 400MHz Titanium Powerbook back in 2001, and by 2003 it was a 1Ghz PowerBook G4 due to the seventeen times I had to send in various computers that were replaced. One of them even melted (<a href=""http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/laptops/another-melted-g4-mac-laptop-231620.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/laptops/another-melted-g4-mac-lap...</a>). So with my MacBook Pro having only a few minor problems (the power button has fallen inside the case, and the isight randomly stops working), I'd say the quality has improved significantly.<p>The networking systems in the Finder are so bad that when I use Vista, I actually breathe a sigh of relief that I can ""map"" network drives and have automatic discovery. Leopard somewhat fixes this, though. <p>As far as the iPhone debacle, I'm really amazed at how poorly Apple is handling the situation. Maliciously destroying their products and punishing their most geeky customers is retarded. Those geeky customers are the ones the non-geeky potential customers go to for advice. Hasn't Steve Jobs read The Tipping Point? When you've pissed off Brian Lam, you're really in trouble.",1191194882

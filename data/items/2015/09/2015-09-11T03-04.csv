Because there have been claims before about that like that the gene for readheads came from Neanderthals but then was discovered that that specific mutation is just naturally occurring for humans and the redhead gene of modern humans isn&#x27;t the same for Neanderthals or other primates.<p>The 1-4% neanderthal DNA is also a bit well iffy, comparing genomes is very tricky and those comparisons often strip away all the large differences e.g. like humans and chimpanzees only share 99% of the genes when you strip about 2/3rd of the genome.<p>So while there might have been interbreeding there&#x27;s very little of actual evidence to point to the extent and the cause of it, could&#x27;ve been social interbreeding, could&#x27;ve been pillage and rape, could&#x27;ve been small isolated cases, could&#x27;ve been widespread, but PC gen-Y notions aside the science isn&#x27;t really clear on on side or the other and it&#x27;s hard to know if it ever will be able to be.",1441942207

You could suggest your own idea or take on a project that the profs had found through their connections with the business world. Either way, you had to convince the professors on the committee that it was worthy of receiving a full course&#x27;s worth of credit (though most people wound up spending far more than that amount of time on it).",1441940943

I could run longer distances just as slowly, and my body composition did not change for the better. Moreover, &quot;just running&quot; did not make me feel good. So for some people (personal anecdata again) it is fair to say that running gains may be slow and seem uncorrelated with training.<p>I did make very very quick gains by &quot;just lifting&quot; and so felt very differently about it.

12895,comment,12625,12795,0,0,randallsquared,,,"For someone with an actual degree, it ranges from ~20K starting on up to 60K or so in this area.  There aren't many of those 60K jobs, though.  People who have ambitions beyond ~40K typically either move or start their own business(es).  More than half the people I know run a one-person business either on the side or instead of having a ""job"".<p>There are a coupla barriers to moving; we have a house to pay for, hardly know anyone (personally) who doesn't live around here, and have issues ""getting a decent salary"" due to history.   I've been freelancing for seven years, with no degree, and it turns out that people aren't interested in hiring someone like that remotely.  <p>In 2003, we gave moving to the Boston area a shot (Nashua), but the only position I managed to get was Comcast tech support (and all our clients were down here, of course), which didn't pay enough to save up enough money for a deposit.  It was a totally different world up there.  Here, if you have a thousand dollars, you can pay a deposit and the first two months rent, and have plenty left over to look for a job for a month.  Your first full paycheck at even a convenience store would pay the rent.  In Nashua, I was making (for the 6 months we were there) about the same amount I would here for the same job, except that landlords wanted outrageous sums for housing that even slumlords would be ashamed of in the South.  ""Let me get this straight: you want nearly a thousand a month for a room that doesn't even have a private bath?!  Did you accidentally include an extra zero?""<p>Anyway, enough ranting. :)  If you've lived in such a place long enough to think it's normal to pay thousands a month, rather than hundreds, just to have food, gas, and a small house, I imagine it's hard to understand the shock.  Six months into that attempted move, after being too exhausted from dealing with people all day (I'm not a people person) to do anything but collapse into bed, it finally became clear that there was essentially no way we would ever be able to save up enough money (we had to stay in weekly places, due to never having the 2K or so it would have required to get a crappy apartment).  We'd been spoiled by doing exactly this same thing in 1998 moving to Florida, and having that turn out well.  <p>So, basically, the biggest barrier is that it would take years of saving, here, to come up with enough money to not instantly be homeless in the Boston area or SV.  Alternatively, we can just continue with doing startups in extremelycheapland, while living a middle class lifestyle on 15 hours of freelancing a week.

The list is generated using advertising database.  There are several recipients that ask to be removed from the list after each mailing, and right now I manually edit the list.<p>My proposed solution is a link in the email to an opt-out landing page.  The opt-outer (new term, courtesy of moi) would enter their email and click ""submit"" to be removed from future mailings.<p>For the next email blast, I would export a CSV of potential clients from the advertising database (it's refreshed monthly), and then using a php script, would compare the two tables (opted-out and new addresses), and wherever an entry exists in both tables it would be removed from the mailing list.  Then export the remaining list into a CSV for a mail merge.<p>Does this look like I'm on the right track or is there any easier way?  Know of any canned scripts that would execute this?<p>Thanks in advance.<p>-Jake Butler (long time reader, first time poster)",1216238276

However, I believe you can also deduct as a sole proprietorship, so the tax benefits of an LLC are more about removing the double taxation of corporations than being able to deduct expenses. But an LLC makes things clearer and formally separates your business from your personal life, so you can track exactly how well its doing and what expenses and income are associated with each.",1216238201

One oversight here, another there, combine them and you have an exploit.<p>The valid point I think Linus is getting at (perhaps I'm reading too much into it) is that if you solve normal, boring bugs, you prevent the much trumpeted security bugs from ever coming out.  By heaping praise on the security team and ignoring the careful programmer who writes good code and eliminates bugs before they exist, Linus sees the community move towards a crisis-solving mode rather than a crisis-prevention mode.  His view is that it's far better to focus on writing good, solid code that tests robustly rather than hyper-focusing on security at the cost of everything else.  This is not to dismiss the importance of security; instead, it is a fundamental focus shift -- thus the example of OpenBSD, where Linus sees security paranoia has subsumed everything else.",1216235149

278594,comment,278421,278421,0,0,DenisM,,,"The fun part is that if you are possessed by feature creep you don't know about it. I have had many a conversation where someone would say ""we must ship absolute minimum of features in v1"" and then turn around and argue for some favorite toy feature in the same breath. Looking back I see myself doing the same. This is one thing I wish i could undo, it would have saved us months off development time.<p>Makes me wonder if I am still possessed, and oblivious.",1219006550
278593,comment,278501,278501,0,0,KevBurnsJr,,,"<i>I interviewed with Redux</i> in July and from what I gathered, they had a pretty good team together.<p>It's a python shop running either on a custom DB or on Berkeley DB.  Their core business asset is the collaborative filtering mechanism that drives the Redux.com site.<p>I got the impression that the site itself is very much a proof-of-concept application of the underlying technology.  They have a BHAG to become the default collaborative filtering mechanism for the internet.  If they are successful, I consider it very likely that they will do so by licensing this technology to other companies.<p>It should also be noted that, as a company, they did not start out in the direction that they're going now.  They've gone through several products and switched directions multiple times, eventually settling upon what they're developing now as a result of that process.<p>If I remember correctly, they are 11 employees, 8 of which are engineers and the CEO is a definite techy.<p>Smells like win to me.",1219006441

278590,comment,278120,278345,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"""The ""limit"" on copyright is duration. The market owns price. You haven't answered my question.""<p>Yes, I did.  See the other comments on compulsory licensing as being  state-sanctioned  price limit, if my own answer was not clear enough.<p>Also,  a reasonable counter-question is, what gives someone the right to prevent me from making a copy of a digital entity?<p>Intellectual ""property"" is quite different from physical goods, and the fact that the Constitution has a special clause for copyright suggests that IP was not meant to be equated with, say, land or other material things.<p>Perhaps copying is the real right, with government offering to restrict that right for a period of time so as  to offer incentives to people to make their creations public.",1219006184

I think there's a couple issues that cause confusion.<p>Yes, REST advocates say your URLs should be for ""resources"" not ""methods"", but sometimes the distinction is blurry. For example, a Google search: <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=restful"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=restful</a><p>Is www.google.com/search a ""resource"" or a ""method""?

Given PG's guidelines, for something to be off-topic it has to not gratify anyone's intellectual curiosity and not be of interest to any hackers.<p>So to say that something is off-topic here, you have to be willing to assert that it is not of interest to any hackers, which means that whoever posted it and whoever voted it up are not hackers. Are you willing to assert that for something that now has 22 points? I wouldn't be willing to assert that for anything that was submitted at all unless it were blatant spam.<p>It seems that everything posted here is, by definition, either spam or on-topic. Perhaps you are looking for a social news site that defines on-topic as being CS-related, but at least according to the current guidelines, that is not this site.<p>That's why I'm constantly annoyed at the off-topic police.  They're trying to make this site into what they wish it were, rather than what it is. Please reread the stated purpose of this site and explain to me how it is possible that that article does not fall within the guidelines.<p><i>Edit: I would appreciate that anyone who downmodded this explain my logical error. Not because I care about the karma, but because I'd like to see at least a reasonable explanation as to how I'm incorrect.</i>",1219005102

How many of you who think you know the entire story have actually ever read the Zimbabwean side of things?<p>It's war 2.0 folks, and you don't even realise it.

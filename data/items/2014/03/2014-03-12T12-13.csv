In particular, I felt this wave of relief after reverting to GNOME2 on my Linux VM and particularly this wave of &quot;the OS isn&#x27;t interfering with me&quot; when moving to Mac OSX. Perhaps it is coming from Windows with the incessant fade-in bubble-shaped popups bottom right near the dreaded notification area that does this? If Windows properly managed this, it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad.<p>Such a small difference between the main system desktop layouts but a large difference in the feeling of being constantly flustered from an attention-seeking system. Weird.<p>(Of course, removal of &quot;distracting&quot; user-interface elements can go to the extreme, as shown in the release notes for Xcode 5 where the toolbar has been refined &quot;to remove distracting elements&quot; or the over-the-top UI culling that has taken hold of GNOME3, eg. the recent changes to gedit as highlighted on the Planet GNOME blog, apparently for the sake of &quot;making it less distracting&quot;.

Evidence supports that reducing time spent sitting, regardless of activity, may improve the metabolic consequences of obesity. Analyses were conducted in a large prospective study of US adults enrolled by the American Cancer Society to examine leisure time spent sitting and physical activity in relation to mortality. Time spent sitting and physical activity were queried by questionnaire on 53,440 men and 69,776 women who were disease free at enrollment. The authors identified 11,307 deaths in men and 7,923 deaths in women during the 14-year follow-up. After adjustment for smoking, body mass index, and other factors, time spent sitting (≥6 vs. <3 hours/day) was associated with mortality in both women (relative risk = 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.25, 1.44) and men (relative risk = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.24). Relative risks for sitting (≥6 hours/day) and physical activity (<24.5 metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours/week) combined were 1.94 (95% CI: 1.70, 2.20) for women and 1.48 (95% CI: 1.33, 1.65) for men, compared with those with the least time sitting and most activity. Associations were strongest for cardiovascular disease mortality. The time spent sitting was independently associated with total mortality, regardless of physical activity level. Public health messages should include both being physically active and reducing time spent sitting.",1394627471

Designing feature rich software for a billion different usecases is quite hard. Its reasonably easy to make one-off products that just do one thing well.<p>> If you put a bad CD in it you can lock the whole window manager up while it&#x27;s thrashing the CD to be head or tales of it. Sometimes crash it. As soon as you hit the hardware eject it will free back up.<p>Wow.. are you running Windows 95 ? :) The CD thing was common back then. The only reason this can happen on NT is because of some really buggy driver/hardware combination but even that is highly unlikely. Whats far more likely is you have some kind of buggy explorer plugin that is attempting to generate helpful thumbnails or something while enumerating an unreadable medium. AFAIK Explorer is still single-threaded for the most part for backwards compatibility - which worsens the impact.

This allows a rolling replace/upgrade cycle that allows the old cruft to continue running while limiting the scope of efforts to something less than the Aegean Stables.<p>One characteristic of the beshitted legacy system is all manner of action-at-a-distance and an embarrassing lack of code reuse so even minor changes in business logic involves a nightmare of grepping and hoping you found all the areas that need to be changed to either support that logic or implement it.  To that end I opted to have a message broker for create/update/delete operations that was responsible for distributing such events to other services as business logic dictated.  Internally we nicknamed it &quot;Sorta SOA&quot;.<p>As an example work flow, a user is created and publishes the event to the broker.  It then can either treat response as a pubsub, acknowledged-level message, or an RPC style message.\nBroker gets message and generates a global transaction ID that can be used to trace all further emitted messages as well as handling final response to the originating service.  It ack-responds to the originator with the ID.  It then has a logic chain based on the name of the event message and can make calls to other services such as the communication service that may email or SMS message someone.  Comm service acks upon successful receipt of message, then on delivery responds with any resultset.  Broker then receives that result set and checks to see if it has completed all tasks for that transaction.  If so, it responds with the results of all tasks (or a defined response using a subset of data from results) to the originator.<p>All services are idempotent and communication is via RabbitMQ to support fabric changes and persistence/guarantees of delivery.<p>Services themselves are RESTful HTTP API for manipulation of the specific nouns they are in charge of.  It&#x27;s allowed us to separate concerns to a surprising degree and formalize business logic in a single area (the broker) for event-driven behaviors.  It also gives us the flexibility to interface with third party services in a manner that was impossible given the previous disastrous code.",1394626578

When I evaluate libraries I do not check my emotional state or what my my stomach is telling me. I use a rational process, a heuristic:<p>I check to see how actively developed the library is. If it&#x27;s on GitHub I check how many people have starred and forked it and when the last commit was.<p>I look at the issues list to see if it has any horrible errors that have been around forever with giant threads.<p>I check the documentation to see if I like what it does.<p>I scan the source code to see if it uses giant functions and globally scoped variables or does other horrible things. I also check for readability.<p>I Google the thing and see if anyone is using it on Twitter.<p>Then I build something small with it and if it helps more than it hurts then maybe it&#x27;s good to go.<p>The place where this heuristic has failed me is with long term big applications. I chose Google Closure for a startup once and it turned out to make everything take much more time than it should have. It was the write more do less library, but at the time there was no backbone.js and Sproutcore, Cappuccino, dojo and ext.js have all pretty much gone away. So I don&#x27;t know how I feel about it now, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t use gut instinct when I can just apply rational thought.",1394625638

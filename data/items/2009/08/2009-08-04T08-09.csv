740864,comment,740425,740425,0,0,lsc,,,"You need to be <i>extremely</i> good at marketing (or at least, have a whole lot of it) to overcome a significant technical disadvantage.   I mean, it can be done, but it takes a lot of marketing muscle.<p>I think most people are better served by focusing on what they are good at.   Sure, your company will always have to do some marketing, if nothing else, you need to somehow let your users know 'hey, product X exists.  it does Y.""<p>You will also have to create a product of some sort.<p>if you have more marketing muscle, then sure, squeeze out some fetid failure of a product that crashes every other day, and that requires a re-install every 6 months.  market the heck out of it, and you can win.<p>but you know?  without a huge amount of marketing muscle, that won't work.<p>If you don't have much by way of marketing skills, produce a good product.   Sure, you still have to market it, but marketing it becomes much easier, because once one person sees it, she is going to tell five others how great it is.<p>so yeah, marketing and technical competence are substitutable to a degree.   I disagree strongly with the thesis that one is way more important than the other.<p>To take an example from the article, sure, fogbuz is beating out other bug trackers that are about as good, that don't have good marketing.  If fogbuz was not about as good as those other bug trackers, though, significantly more marketing muscle would have been required.<p>I think why marketing seems more important at the top end of the market (that is, it's easy to name examples of technical superiority being trumped by marketing)  is that it is easier to scale marketing, if you are a large company, than to scale technical competence.<p>Even then, it makes sense to do a cost/benefit and say 'if we diverted x percent of the marketing dollars to dev, how much more good word of mouth would we get?'   or 'if we divert x dollars from development to marketing, how many brand new customers in new markets would we get?'<p>This is ignoring that 'figure out what the user wants'  is generally considered part of marketing, and is often an important part of building something worth having.   (it doesn't need to be... you can start with 'what would be best for the user' - assuming that you can design something the user can not imagine, that the user would like once they see it because it works better.  Both are valid places to start building a product.)",1249375245

I just didn't feel hungry in the morning and it seemed like too much hassle to prepare something. But now that I have actually started to have breakfast as part of my morning routine (I really had to force myself to begin with) I find that my energy levels during the morning are much improved and so is my concentration.<p>I'd recommend you try something that you don't have to chew too much to begin with. Like oat meal (lots of complex carbohydrates which is good for me because I do weight training). I buy boxes of compressed bricks of oats that come apart once soaked in milk for a while. two or three bricks in a bowl and I usually add a little protein powder (weight training again) and maybe a little extra sweetener (usually the protein powder is enough). Quick to eat and I'm not really big on chewy/crunchy stuff right after I get up, too much effort. :)",1249374992

In the US they feel like they are built more for cars.<p>- Pretty much everything is more expensive in the UK than the US<p>- Pedestrians take more 'right of way' in the UK whereas in the US it's 'watch out or get hit'.<p>- The UK has much better public transport than the US<p>- UK cars are tiny and US cars are huge.<p>- Some people in the UK people do tend to think it was a big deal to drive 100 k's to go somewhere.

740851,comment,740643,740787,0,0,jballanc,,,"Indeed, and this seems to be one of the main motivations behind the notion of fair use. Is it such a stretch to go from discussing a piece around the water cooler, to e-mailing the link to some friends and associates, to posting opinion and criticism in a more permanent form on a blog? It seems to me that this sort of ""reprocessing"" of a story has been going on for ages, but that sometime in the late 70s to mid 80s society grew faster than individuals ability to communicate with their peers. It is only now that we are catching up. So why are newspapers so taken aback that we are discussing the stories they write?<p>In other words, I would highly doubt that what Gawker did does anything materially to diminish the value or profitability of the original reporting. Rather, it seems that news papers are failing not because of re-publication and fair use, but because they had tied themselves to an economic model (advertising) which they, ultimately, did not fully control.",1249374769

The pricing is different than the eCommerce platform (the link you've sent) and can be either a license cost if the payments are processed by your own payment system or a variable pricing scheme if the Avangate payment system is used.<p>In terms of what appears on the customer credit card, it's not just the string ""Avangate"" that will show on the statement, but also your website.

I was lucky enough to take a seminar with David Pesetsky from MIT shortly after Everett's story began appearing in the popular media, and he discussed what he perceived as serious flaws in Everett's findings and methodology. 
Nevins, Pesetsky, and Rodrigues have since published a lengthy and detailed rebuttal (<a href=""http://ling.auf.net/lingBuzz/000411"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ling.auf.net/lingBuzz/000411</a>) that shows that Piraha does in fact have recursion. In fact, the surprising thing about Piraha is how unremarkable it is. It shares traits with German, Hindi, Hebrew, and many more languages. Pesetsky, et. al. also believe that the argument that quantifiers do not exist is not supported by the facts. More details are in the paper.<p>As far as their culture is concerned, there is evidence from other anthropologists that the Piraha do indeed have creation myths (the rebuttal paper actually includes one on page 44).<p>People jump on stories like these because it makes for a good news story (""Rebel Linguist Takes Down Noam Chomsky"").

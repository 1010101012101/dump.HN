I expect there to be a bit of &quot;sizzle&quot; not &quot;steak&quot; in a title because it has to catch your eye and compete with other titles.<p>I had a chuckle yesterday because there was an HN News story that was briefly on the front page with a title something like &quot;95 year old smashes world 200m record&quot;. About 80% of the posts complained that the title was misleading because it was the world record for his age group. I would have thought that was self evident - did they really expect a 95 year old to break the open WR for 200m?",1451127372

One can dynamically &quot;draw&quot; out structures having controlled variable-height profiles inside the vacuum chamber during the evaporation process by altering the position (and thus speed) of the moving shadow mask.<p>This method is quite different from the &quot;ordinary&quot; metallic vapour deposition process you&#x27;re referring to that uses a simple fixed-position mask, usually photoresist that is baked right onto the silicon wafer.<p>Eg, here is my research paper from 8 yrs ago demonstrating nanoscale-level dynamic stencil deposition using a  nanopore in a suspended silicon nitride membrane shadow mask. We controlled the mask&#x27;s position using a piezo actuator inside the deposition chamber during the evaporation process to 3D print nanowires and other nanostructures with programmable height profiles. Eg, we created nanoramps, and nanowires with one or more &quot;valleys&quot; to simulate quantum wells or metallic grains.\n<a href=""http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/rsi/79/7/10.1063/1.2960573"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/rsi/79/7/10.106...</a>\nArxiv link : <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.1848.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.1848.pdf</a>",1451125682

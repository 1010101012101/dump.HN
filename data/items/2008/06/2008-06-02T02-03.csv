206395,comment,206304,206304,0,0,rtf,,,"I don't know, how about every subject?<p>Multiplication. Long division. Algebra. Geometry. Trig. Calc.<p>I was never very motivated to study math. The problem was, my older brother was very into it(and now is a math grad student, ever-so-slowly getting his thesis together). This set a model that I could not hope to emulate, but it only meant my mom pushed me more, talked to the school to get me into the advanced/accelerated classes I didn't really want to take. She probably would have done some of that without my brother around, but not as much.<p>This led me down the ""please the parents"" line of study, which naturally meant some surreptitious, embarrassed attempts at cheating. This only made me feel worse, of course.<p>In college I started into computer science, thinking that I at least liked the programming. But integral calc sunk me for good, and in a particularly bad quarter that was my low point, I tried taking linear algebra as well as a repeat of calculus, thinking that perhaps the extra pressure would do something good.<p>Of course not. I dropped linear algebra and failed calc again. After that, I decided to declare in economics, restarted calculus with the ""ez-for-econ-majors"" series and sailed through those courses with a solid B average. I struggled through, but passed on the first try, the two intermediate econ courses which started introducing serious mathematical modelling. The remainder of the major was electives, and not difficult ones.<p>I never knew, until after that whole period of my life was over with, exactly what was holding me back. Now I'm pretty sure that it's about motivation and dedication. My brother is fairly normal but can get interested enough in math problems to sacrifice his well-being. The genius researchers of the field sacrifice well-being regularly, without really knowing it, and are typically slightly unhinged socially.<p>As for myself, I tend to run away from a challenging math problem. So, even if I'm forced to tackle it, it will probably take me 10 times as long to solve as it would my brother(not even factoring in his years of experience now). Once I overcome those hurdles particular to a new category of problem I am fine, but I have to take considerable effort to do so.<p>Summing that difference up over a long-term period like that of a college course, the best students can zoom far ahead because of this motivation factor, even if they aren't necessarily the _smartest_. Indeed, many math students reach the upper-division levels on memorization alone and get stuck from there, as proofs take on more and more importance. That's a major failing of current math education in the United States - overdependence on rote techniques. (The former Soviet educational system, OTOH, had probably some of the strongest math education, and much of it has been translated to English - pick up a book from that period and you will probably see a small and dense text that introduces high-level concepts in great, if unforgiving, detail. Very different from the thick drill+practice textbooks I'm used to.)<p>My conclusion: many academic fields can accommodate a half-hearted practice. Math is not one of them. And our society doesn't respect that difference, shoving it under the rug as ""I'm just not good at math.""",1212375563

206393,comment,206261,206273,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>I thought there was a client app that did most of the data management?</i><p>Well, yes.  But it's a command-line application, and all of the communication with my server is via a client-server API, not via a web browser -- maybe this isn't quite what you meant in your original question, but it certainly fits on the ""without a UI"" side of things.<p><i>if I had I desktop application and was a user of tarsnap could I bake backups into my app?</i><p>It would be difficult to bake tarsnap backups into your application directly, but tarsnap's command-line interface is almost exactly the same as tar's -- and I suspect that tar is one of the top 10 most commonly scripted UNIX programs.  So if it would be very easy for your application to run tarsnap as a subprocess.",1212375150

My first semester, I took four consecutive courses in calculus.  By the fourth one, I was extremely burned out on math and barely squeaked by.<p>I ended up taking a couple more math classes before graduating (discrete math and linear algebra), have continued to study math on my own, and have recently been contemplating a master's degree in math, just because I want to learn more.<p>All of that is to say, I'm not sure that the math brick wall is constant, but perhaps sometimes you need to take a break to allow your mind to digest what you've learned so far.",1212375138

You are quite right about that definition.<p>There has been an ongoing discussions over at Haque's HBP site about this for a couple months now, so I was operating under the definition that his discussions were operating under.

Not quite.<p>Huge problems are those problems where everyone is doing things one way, and that way is stupid.  For example, the way food is distributed is a huge problem, because it has inefficiencies that happen all over the world and are multiplied billions of times over.<p>I'm not happy with that.

It seems to be 1) anything that isn't funded by VCs 2) huge in the sense of taking a long time to solve. Or both.<p>Once you do commit to a concrete definition, why do you believe that VCs should be considered sources of funding for the problem? For example if LHC fits your definition of a huge problem, you may want to consider its funding model as an alternative.",1212373664

Almost everything can be attributed to exposure and effort at some point rather than some innate smartness.<p>A lot of advanced math takes some serious concentration to understand.  For some non-practical aspects, I found that I lacked the motivation rather than ability to understand it .  One particular class where I seemed to hit my tolerance was a theoretical linear algebra class.  I could understand the practical applications of most of the topics but some of the theory seemed just out of reach.  The book was extremely dry  and I think the professor may have been taking lessons from Ben Stein.<p>Give me a private tutor, a theoretical linear algebra for dummies book, and a pending disaster for which this is the solution, and I bet the outcome would be a little different.",1212373463

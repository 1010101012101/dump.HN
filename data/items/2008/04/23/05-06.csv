But having witnessed myself and others struggle to figure out ""wait, which way is which according to this map?"" for a little bit before getting our internal compass aligned with the map's orientation, it would be much simpler to literally <i>point your camera at something</i> and have it tell you what's in that direction.  Depending on how precise the tags are, they would also be useful just to provide information about various interesting objects in the area, particularly if you can see tags that everyone puts on real-world objects.",1208930145

171321,comment,170825,171273,0,0,aflag,,,"That would be nice initiative. But his main point seems to be that you just can't give your customer the truth. Even if it's not viable, for some reason, to make sure the situation that happened to your customer never repeats itself again, the blogger seems to say that you better agree with the customer. That's just wrong. You better give a straight answer, like ""we are not capable of teaching that to our workers, you should teach them yourself the next time"".<p>Of course, in that particular situation, giving instruction for the people working at the parking lot <i>shouldn't</i> be a big problem. So I agree that he should have done it, but I stand by his choice of giving a straight answer instead of saying he feels bad for the customer and will change things, but in the end he doesn't.",1208929621

The exchange is voluntary, after-the-fact, and if you make $10B the school doesn't (necessarily) get a percentage.  That's basically a loan: you get school paid for now, and you pay it back over the next several years.<p>One or two fraternities, I'd heard, actually have you sign over some small percentage of your salary (1-2%?) for life.

171316,comment,170542,170888,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Given that the vocabulary (by a loose definition of ""vocabulary"") of any new skill is a significant portion of the barrier to becoming proficient, I would say that making that aspect a solved problem would be a miraculous improvement in learning efficiency.<p>For example, learning a new programming language (once you know how to program in general) is at least 50% vocabulary.  It's learning the keywords and syntax, library functions, etc.  Likewise for most kinds of skills.  Sailing is largely knowing the names, the knots, and the laws (plus practice).  Driving is laws, and a few basic automotive concepts.  Law is lots and lots of cases.  Medicine is lots and lots of anatomy.  All of these things are memorization, and that memorization is a barrier to expertise.<p>Memorization is clearly <i>not</i> the most useless type of learning.  It's core to almost every skill.",1208929374
171315,comment,155360,155360,0,0,brianlash,,,"I'm late to this conversation but thought I'd weigh in anyway because I found myself in a similar predicament recently.  I was able to recruit a talented developer-partner on the grounds that he'd receive 40% of the sale price of the application.  Maybe my experience can help you.<p>When it comes to recruiting, I think the answer lies in speaking candidates' language (if it's a business guy, remind him that startup experience looks great on a resume; for developers, make sure they know you appreciate the importance of their role to the success of your project).  I think it's most important for the latter that they believe they'll do important work and feel appreciated... it's regretable so many of them have had bad experiences with crappy employers, but you can use that history to your advantage by setting yourself apart from it.<p>The rest is details:  Write up a job description using your best Ogilvyian copy (reference copyblogger.com).  Headlines matter.<p>I also suggest you use a triangulation strategy when you talk about compensation.  I approached it by offering candidates their option of 1) $2500, 2) $1500 + 8% equity, or 3) 40% equity.  On its own the 40% arrangement wouldn't have stirred much interest, but set against the backdrop of the other two options it looked like a great opportunity.  I designed it that way deliberately with favorable results.<p>Hope this helps.",1208929260

Ratio of guys to girls in most work places is 3/1.  It is expensive to live, so girls in early 20s choose to live somewhere else.<p>There is also very expensive housing (second after manhatan), and potential of earthquakes,  but compare to Boston and most of the South is much much better.<p>And I agree, transportation is kinda sucky.  I find myself using a car, even within the city.<p>BTW, not everybody works in Southbay or peninsula.  I actually do work in emeryville (east bay), and the commute is about 25-35 mins, depending on traffic.<p>But, also many young startups are choosing SF and not peninsula to start up.

My apologies for bringing up race, but I used to rent an art studio in the Bayview and that was the only place in SF that I've seen block parties. I've lived mainly in white yuppie neighborhoods in various parts of the country and never encountered a block party in any of them. There have only been annual ""street fairs.""

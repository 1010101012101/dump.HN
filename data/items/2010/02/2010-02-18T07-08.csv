Take out an unneeded form element.  Take out the verbose explanations of questions so the form looked less intimidating.  Choose an email subject line that attracted the right group of people for that email.<p>Most developers would think of those as minor changes.  None took more than a couple of hours to code.  But I've seen those changes result in 10-40% lifts to the bottom line.  That's <i>not</i> a minor change to the business as a whole.<p>More importantly the figures that were quoted suggest about 800 conversions/day.  The patience to let tests run 2-4 weeks can result in measuring that level of improvement.  And after you have a few wins of that size, you start a virtuous cycle where every improvement makes it easier to raise traffic volume, which makes it easier to run A/B tests, which makes it easier to find further improvements.",1266478976

In short: you, probably.<p>Yahoo's big groups: struggling societies, blue-collar backbone, remote America. In short: middle America (and also poorer urban folks).<p>Within Yahoo, the general consensus is that our biggest market is middle-aged housewives from the midwest. This is a big group, although as the study points out we actually trend younger than Google -- this is because our media properties, likes games, sports, and IM, attract teenagers, a market Google doesn't really serve.<p>While a certain amount of traffic is driven through partnerships, it's nowhere near big enough to account for Yahoo's enormous volume. Although they're not new or cool, properties like the Yahoo.com frontpage, Yahoo News (bigger than CNN and the NYTimes combined), Sports (bigger than ESPN), Finance (by far the biggest) and Mail (40% of the market) absolutely dominate their respective categories and, despite the general perception of Yahoo as a company in decline, are mostly holding steady or growing slowly in terms of audience.<p>The selection bias amongst tech professionals in their perception of Yahoo is a huge barrier to Yahoo's hiring, acquisition, and new tech launches -- simply put, the tech community doesn't use our products, and as a result, they believe <i>nobody</i> uses our products.<p>It simply isn't true. Yahoo isn't growing as fast as Facebook -- hence being overtaken -- but it's still growing and attracting new users every day, both domestically and worldwide.

You don't want to run a few big tests.<p>Instead run multiple minor tests at the same time.  Make your tests be small changes - an email subject line, the size of a button, the help text you're using, etc.  And test them in parallel to let you answer questions more quickly.<p>This strategy is not perfect because there may be interaction effects between your different tests.  With larger traffic volumes you can address that problem.  With smaller ones you need to hope that interactions are not significant.  Usually interactions are not that significant, so you'll get away with the simple strategy.<p>What sorts of things should you test?  Here are some ideas.  Button size, page layout, help text, adding/removing form questions, email text, email subject lines, landing pages, registration pages, and so on and so forth.  Interestingly the overall aesthetics of your site can be tested but seldom show a result.  You tend to get payoffs from stuff that directly affects user interactions at points where users are not very motivated to continue with your site.<p>If you're going to be at the SXSW conference next month, the CEO of Freshbooks has a panel on A/B testing on Sunday that will give you some great concrete ideas of what has worked for a variety of companies.

You spent a week setting it up, you can let it run for a month.  That would let you detect differences 1/4 of the size of the ones that are significant from your 2 days of data.<p>And besides, if you need a week to set up an A/B test then you don't have a good A/B testing framework for your site.  Solve that problem, then A/B tests should be easy to do.",1266476774

If you have less traffic, testing for drastic, bigger changes will definitely give you statistically significant differences (either positive or negative). In fact, even the bigger sites can choose to include just a fraction of their traffic (say 2%) and then test for dramatically different designs/callouts/etc.",1266476588
1133609,comment,1131435,1132460,0,0,elblanco,,,"I think iii is the most interesting of those. How to succinctly describe formal systems is a very hard topic. The kind of mathematical notation we use in classical mathematics (algebra through calculus) is an <i>amazing</i> achievement developed over centuries (most of it since the 14th century!). But it only describes the existence of a calculation to be performed, not that actual method of calculation (the algorithm).<p>Our ability to represent the methods of that calculation are extremely primitive. I suppose Lambda calculus is pretty close as are most modern programming languages. Upper and lower bound notation (like big-O) isn't bad as a kind of descriptor, but it's very restrictive in what you can do with it. I've seen certain kinds of state notation that's interesting-ish. But nothing approaches the elegance, flexibility (it's easy to abuse in good ways), extensibility, simplicity and efficiency of math notation (though even that system falls down when doing lots of matrix calculations by hand). But it beats the pants off of any other system I've seen for general mathematics.<p>Most of the things that we deal with in CS are so big and complex that even diagramming them by hand would take longer than we'd want and require more paper than we have. In math we have some nice symbols to bundle all that complexity up, like pi, or summation, or limit notation. In CS we lack that. Most of the time we try and get by with toy examples, like graphs with half-a-dozen nodes, or small trees only a couple levels deep with different colored lines or some such -- most of it seems to be diagrams and tables...lots and lots and lots of diagrams and tables. Regular Expressions seemed about as close as we ever got to describing something succinctly. Learning how to manipulate graphs just off of the regexes was a very cool experience.<p>I remember distinctly how frustrated my CS professors were compared to my Mathematics professors when trying to explain some concept on the board. I don't ever recall seeing a nice symbol that represented say, a tree, with some various super or subscripts that succinctly described all of the properties of that tree and the algorithm we were going to be using. Imagine how powerful it would be to write down, with just a few strokes, a short series of symbols that unambiguously defined a red-black tree and a search algorithm that runs in such and such min-time-complexity, max-time-complexity, and average-complexity as just a simple operator! Maybe something as simple as Y(rb) + s(log n, log n, ""search term"") = [s|earch term] or some such! But alas, I'm just falling back on a slightly bruised mathematic formal notation, not really anything new.<p>Given how rudimentary the tools are we have to work with, it's amazing how far we've come in so short a time.",1266476584

If you can show your professor that you know everything he is teaching, I'm sure he will help make it challenging for you. Ie either by giving harder assignments where you'll learn more or he wont take your attendance and let you sit in on some other advanced class which you'll find more challenging.<p>Do NOT leave school. There's no other place where you'll find smart people who are paid money to teach you the stuff that you want. And those grades will make a huge difference in your income and how your viewed when you go in for a job.<p>Ask for help with your problem from the sources available to you and you will get it.

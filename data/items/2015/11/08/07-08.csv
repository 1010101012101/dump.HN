10527898,comment,10526678,10526678,0,0,malandrew,,,"FWIW the restaurants behind these actually do a lot better. Imagine you own a restaurant. You serve lunch and dinner. You kitchen is utilized from 11 to 2 for lunch and from 6 to 10 for dinner. With these apps your kitchen now is utilized before 11 prepping food for delivery for lunch and again from 2 to 6, prepping food for dinner. You&#x27;re now making more on your capital investments and your kitchen staff is getting more hours. The people cooking the food are the same as if you went to a restaurant and the people delivering are the same that would be wait staff. If you didn&#x27;t feel bad for these people before why would you feel bad for them now because there is an app in front?",1446969362

Some post docs are worth $300,000 per year, while the bottom 20% are worth -$100,000 per year.

Cloudflare isn&#x27;t acting as a dumb TCP proxy which would allow that. When it hosts an HTTPS website, it does so by terminating the HTTPS connections itself. Cloudflare has the private key, and can see the content of every request/response.

Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iOS, Windows Mobile, Android, etc.  Most of the time these bugs are patched in a timely fashion due to the fact that the publisher can release a bug fix directly to the end user&#x27;s device.  This applies to everything except most Android devices.<p>When a major bug is discovered in Android, first, Google fixes it and published the code. This is usually done quickly.  Second, the phone manufacturers take that fix and incorporate it into their own Android build process with all their extra layers (HTC Sense, Samsung TouchWiz, etc).  This second step takes anywhere from a few weeks to infinity (aka it never happens).  Third, the carrier takes the manufacturers build and adds their own cruft to it, maybe tests it, and then pushes it out to their customers as an over the air (OTA) update.  This third step takes anywhere from a month to infinity (aka it never happens).<p>Due to the interference of manufacturers and carriers, I would not recommend using Android on anything other than a Nexus device purchased directly from Google or a retail/online store.

My office is actually a house in the same neighborhood. I completely believe in my product.<p>Before this I worked at Microsoft for 4 years. It was a wonderful experience. The people were crazy smart and fun to work with. Best working period of my life. I was on the Visual Basic team. Like any Microsoft product, VB had tens of thousands of bugs that went unfixed. This was the right choice for stockholders, a group that includes pension funds, which literally means widows and orphans number among the stockholders. We knew from experience that most customers won&#x27;t buy a product that consists solely of bug fixes. So the backlog stayed until those bugs were declared not showstoppers--and therefore the product was deemed as having zero bugs.<p>It was the right choice for Microsoft. It was the right choice for the stockholders. It was probably the right choice for customers, because most of them were in the enterprise. Their department budgets are easier to justify when a product update requires lots of new headcount and training expenses. Consultants, ditto.<p>It just wasn&#x27;t the right choice for me.

10527814,comment,10527787,10527787,0,0,tomcam,,,"The simplest way to create a website is just HTML and CSS, right? You can type that shit up on your desktop, post it to a server, and voilà--website! Advantages: fastest possible performance and way less surface area for attacks.<p>Suppose you decide to add a footer to every page. If you&#x27;re not a wiz at sed and command-line scripting you&#x27;ll have a big chore ahead of you. Plus you might forget some pages. Plus logging into FileZilla or using SSH in order to post the files can be dreary and time-consuming.<p>If you&#x27;re putting up a catalog or other site derived from a database, you have a whole other set of problems. Now you really want to automate. You could write this in Symfony or web2py or Django an put it on your server. If people go to yoursite.com/catalog/flashlights it&#x27;s actually running a file called, say, flashlights.php that dynamically queries the database and creates HTML on the fly with a list of the flashlights category in your catalog. Advantage: it&#x27;s always up to date. Disadvantage: Slower (every visit to yoursite.com/catalog/flashlights results in a database hit) and much broader attack surface.<p>BTW that&#x27;s a little bit of a simplification. You can cache the results of the visit to yoursite.com/catalog/flashlights as an HTML file at the cost of added complexity.<p>A dynamic, data-driven site like that can sometimes be intercepted via evil methods such as a browser-issued SQL query or CSS injection (probably not with web2py because it&#x27;s got great security, but you get my point). Dynamically generated sites, which is most of the big ones, are particularly vulnerable because of the database. Database managers are big and complex.<p>OK, so imagine you have a program written in Python or C or Java or whatever on your desktop. It can easily be modified to add footers or render HTML files from a database, then post the pages to your server. Advantage: pre rendered HTML files are fast and way less likely to get hacked. Disadvantage: could be less up to date. The catalog database may be updated and the rendered HTML may lag.<p>If you really want to get fancy you can have the program running on the server. It goes through your database and templates to create each page of the site, but instead of creating dynamic pages that run PHP or Python in order to render a web page, it creates spits out straight HTML (aka &quot;static HTML&quot;) with the contents once a day or whatever. Now a visit to yoursite.com/catalog/flashlights actually resolves to yoursite.com/catalog/flashlights.html.<p>In theory static site generators are easier to understand and get started with. That&#x27;s not always true, but it is true that page renders are invariably faster because it&#x27;s just pure HTML and not database queries are needed.",1446966105

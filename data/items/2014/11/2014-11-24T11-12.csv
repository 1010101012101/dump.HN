The layout is non-responsive and creates massive amounts of scrollbars on &quot;portrait&quot;-monitors, while 90% of the screen is effectively white-space.<p>Completely wasted.

8651966,comment,8651641,8651734,0,0,atirip,,,"IMHO Good Thing is to have set of libraries and not a framework at all. Start with handcrafting all HTML,CSS with interactions you need. You HTML skeleton will depend greatly on what you want to achieve - like when one page changes to other and theres a ajax call between - where you put the wait screen: as separate, on old page, then wait, transit to new at once, then wait and so on. If that is done you know broadly what you need. Example configuration may be React for rendering, cherry picked Model (or State) from Ampersand, Backbone Events Standalone for event bus. Something for History/routes too, can&#x27;t recommend anything specific because my projects did not had one (yes, you can build web-app without back button support). This way if something better comes up, you can switch, if something is abandoned, gets your way, you can switch. Or you can rewrite it in-house fairly easily. I imagine that when you discover that React is too much, too heavy, too bloaty (for example, i&#x27;m not saying, that it is, we are happy React users now), then preserving all API calls and replacing it with few lines of Mustache templates is doable.

8651953,comment,8651599,8651845,0,0,vidarh,,,"I&#x27;m not so sure lack of distractions makes that much difference. I think on my C64 it was frequently the case that we&#x27;d switch games every few minutes. We were easily distracted with or without something specific to trigger it.<p>But these computers were simple enough to &quot;mess with&quot; and get a mental model of the whole. By the time I was 7-8, I started &quot;experimenting&quot; with pulling chips out of sockets (to my parents horror) and seeing what happened if I put them in different places (...). If you even could  have done that on modern machines with almost everything surface mounted, you&#x27;d fry stuff. With those old machines that was usually fairly hard. Amazingly, I never burned out any chips that way. The simplicity encouraged meddling with things in a way that is harder to see younger kids do with most modern computers:<p>PCs are outright dangerous to let a young child dismantle on their own - whether or not you disconnect power (I&#x27;m afraid my C64&#x27;s were more than once opened up while connected..); machines like the Raspberry Pi are simple and safe enough, but there&#x27;s nothing to <i>do</i> inside them. Likewise for tablets and smart phones: If you manage to disconnect the display without breaking anything, you&#x27;re pretty much at the limits.<p>If you try to break into the black box as a child, you&#x27;re faced with an image of something that is way beyond your comprehension.<p>The C64 and similar home computers, on the other hand, had clearly labelled diagrams in their manuals that even a child could understand. You&#x27;d open it up, and you&#x27;d see what the different things were, and you could tinker (at least if you didn&#x27;t tell your parents) and see the effects.<p>It seems like it is harder to become &quot;independent&quot;: Children learn a few &quot;magic incantations&quot; to get to the familiar things, and the knowledge required to bridge the gaps where exploration yields results that encourage further exploration seems higher.  Or maybe that&#x27;s what it looked like to our parents too.<p>A few years older, I soldered wires straight onto the pins of the CPU of my Amiga. You could make a &quot;pause&quot; switch and reset button easily that way - you could solder it onto the bus exposed on the left hand side of the A500&#x27;s too, but I had a hard drive attached there.<p>Speaking of hard drives, considering the article mentions demonstrating floppy drives with the cover off, of course I did that with my 1541 drive for the C64 (and test what happened when moving the IO chips between the 1541 and the C64 - they&#x27;re &quot;almost&quot; the same model; enough so that the C64 at least will run; same for the one from the Amiga - their differences are small enough to be inconsequential for most programs), but also with my first (20MB) hard drive out of necessity: I bought it used, and within 6 months it started having problems starting up. The solution? Open it up, and give the motor a helping hand spinning up the platter - after that it worked fine. The drive survived another two years I think after that.",1416829503

I didn&#x27;t verify that macro.h was included by every file that used assert(). But I&#x27;m assuming it does. So it looks like assert() at least doesn&#x27;t call abort() in their world.

They are not just toys to experiment and play around, they can lead to serious technological advancements. We live in the information age, if it were me I&#x27;d say that the pinnacle of this &quot;information&quot; age would be accessing all kind of information from everywhere. And to do that, you need to actually immerse yourself into it fully.<p>Imagine visiting your friends or parents or relatives in another continent, without having to move from your chair. No, not like Skype or whatnot, actually BEING there with them. VR can give you that (and in the future, it can give you force feedback and tactile feedback too!). You will be able to visit the Coliseum in Rome without moving from your NYC apartment. You will be able to commute to work in milliseconds without having to get up from your bed. People with moving disabilities (like a wheelchair or whatnot) will be able to walk again and interact with people as they never have done before.<p>Furthermore, VR can be used to train people in several jobs, like being a pilot, a surgeon, a firefighter or whatnot. Even put people in situations they have never been before. It can be used by psychologists and doctors to treat patients, diagnose mental problems, study and research some conditions of the mind, etc etc.<p>Last, but not least, AR can provide an additional layer of information on top of our everyday life. Yes, VR gets you stuck in a chair at home and you will never go outside, but when/if you do, there is AR to assist you. You will be able to interact with every terminal around you while walking down the city (or at a park, or whatnot). You will have an overlay of information and knowledge on top of reality that will not only make your life easier, it will AUGMENT it. Nevermind hiring a guide when you want to actually visit a museum, you can just pop on your AR kit and tap into the knowledgebase of every person in the world. Just there, at the tip of your fingers.<p>Anyhow, let&#x27;s be real, AR and VR are damn cool anyway.",1416827438

Or is it possible that with the right team, the right architecture, Angular can actually be a really great framework to use? The common theme for every large Angular project I&#x27;ve worked on is that the teams have leaned towards a more functional design where state is rarely used. This has always seemed to encourage smaller, decoupled modules which don&#x27;t suffer from many of the problems that the author mentions.<p>But hey, it&#x27;s probably the kool-aid.",1416827065

I have a web browser I&#x27;m using to type this reply. It also has 8 other tabs open - more tabs will be added later as I continue on my search for knowledge. I have a Konsole terminal open with IRC sessions to multiple servers and channels open. I have PyCharm loaded. I have a VM running, and more to run later. All vying for my time and energy. A child using this machine would be overwhelmed.<p>Even a Raspberry Pi can distract the user of it in the same manner as my desktop.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s time to reintroduce kids today to the CoCo2&#x27;s, the VIC-20&#x27;s, the C64&#x27;s, the Spectrums, the ZX81&#x27;s and so on. Perhaps getting kids to use single-task-at-a-time systems to learn instead of the distraction-inducing tech. of today, would be a very good idea.<p>When my son was 2.5 years old, I put in front of him an ancient old Compaq laptop running Debian. It had Tuxpaint running on it, and I just put it in front of him and let him go on it. Within a short space of time he was using Tuxpaint like a &quot;pro&quot;, and then he learned how to power the machine up, and type in his login name and password. Sure, you can do this with today&#x27;s systems, but they do make it so easy to provide tons of distractions.",1416826846

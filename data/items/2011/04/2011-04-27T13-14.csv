As iPhone users we wanted a new way to discover apps on the store and benefit from discounts on great apps. We used Free Apps a Day but we are not fan of the idea of installing a new app to get new apps. Also we forgot most of the time to open it and judge that it doesn't deserve to have notifications ON.<p>We thought about text message. How we can open them easily and switch to something else fast. So we put together AppsTxt.com .<p>Starting Monday, you will receive a direct link to download free apps, on which we've negotiated cool deals we have with friend-apps! Until then we would love to gather your feedback on the idea and your suggestions. Of course feel free to register, I guarentee you that we will NEVER spam you.<p>Thank you by advance for your feedback!",1303912562

This claim is related to the fact that she's working on a new analysis method that gives far better resolution of triglycerides versus contaminants (chlorophyll, phospholipids, et cetera) and as a result she's come across a lot of problem cases that the present method can't discern.<p>In short, she's familiar with the state of the art and she's pessimistic that it will ever go anywhere, let alone within the next year.",1303912252

The amount of FPisms that you can bring to an ASP.net app are few and far between. On a low level, C# (at least at that time) had very poor FP support.

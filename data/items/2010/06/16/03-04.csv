1434653,comment,1434509,1434509,0,0,dmfdmf,,,"Start an ""ideas"" folder (write them down or they drift away) and get your degree (from anywhere, not necessarily from Columbia. Once working, most fields do not care about the pedigree of your degree unless you want to be a Supreme Court judge or advisor to the president, etc.). A degree opens doors that are closed without one. And getting one after you move forward and start you career and LIFE (esp the wife and kids) is just not possible for most people.  It seems like an onerous diversion now but in the end you will look back and value the time spent learning and the people you meet in college. While you are getting your degree you can probably pick up consulting work like you did for your parents and continue to practice and learn what is taught in school (and think of more great ideas). When you near the end of school you can break out the ideas folder and see how many are done and how many no longer make any sense and mold the remaining ideas into viable business/action plans. Your friends from college may want to join you too.<p>tl;dr: A lack of degree will limit future options; learning is easy when you are young and harder when you are older; get your degree now, the world will still be there when you are done; write down your ideas.",1276660697

You're physically and mentally tired, you won't produce quality work and you'll begin to dread working on your side project.<p>Here is some simple advice that has worked for me very well in the past, in exactly your situation (and I've gone on to run those side projects successfully and even exit from one via acquisition).<p>__Work on your side projects in the morning__<p>This involves some lifestyle changes, i.e. waking up early.  The process, once mature, involves 3 steps:<p>1) On the commute home after work, think of 1 concrete thing you want to achieve the next morning on your side project.  Relax and watch TV etc whilst going over in your head what you're going to do in terms of execution.<p>2) Go to sleep early (say 11pm) and wake up at 6am.<p>3) Do the stuff you thought about.  Your mind will be fresh, you'll be looking <i>forward</i> to working, and if you can charge through 1 to-do list item per day, that's good, consistent progress.<p>Keeping a strict routine of this you can maintain a very quick pace of product iteration.  Much faster than you'd think, for just a couple of hours a day.  It's all about filling those hours with concrete tasks and being in the right mindset to Get Things Done.<p>Hope that helps.",1276660690

1434647,comment,1434275,1434469,0,0,jerf,,,"That will work for an absolutely rigidly pure sine wave of identical frequency, and even then produces a cancellation moire pattern like this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two-point-interference-ripple-tank.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two-point-interference-rip...</a> , not universal cancellation. Any frequency deviation whatsoever will produce something different. Trying to use this technique to ""cancel"" things that aren't sine waves and aren't even constant frequencies won't have any cancellation effect, it'll simply be two sounds instead of one.<p>(Record yourself saying something. Record yourself saying it again. Flip the phase of one of them and add them to each other. You can do this until the sun goes out, you'll never get a ""cancellation"", you'll just get two voices. A nice effect in some cases, it's one of my favorite things about 60s pop music even if it got overdone to the point of cliche, but not cancellation.)<p>Or, to say it another way, that won't work.<p>It is not possible to universally cancel one wave with another not in the same position. Noise-cancelling headphones work by, with great effort and with some fast processing, creating a small zone where frequencies human ears can hear are dampened to a significant degree where the eardrum is. This comes at the cost of making it louder in places where the ear drum isn't (which we don't care about), and IIRC at the cost of some very high frequency noise well above what we can hear (which we also don't care about). In a way, it's fair to say they barely work; not in the sense that they are poorly manufactured or anything, but that it takes great cleverness to get something that works even as well as they do. There's a reason why they only came to be very recently; it isn't anywhere near as easy as sticking a microphone on the outside, inverting the signal, and playing the inverted signal on a headphone speaker, which could have been done decades ago. That, too, will produce some exciting acoustic effects, but will only cancel a very small and effectively random suite of frequencies, and you won't find it useful in general. Noise cancellation is <i>just shy</i> of impossible, and only works with some heavy caveats, like having the cancellation equipment extremely proximal to the audio receiver (ears in our case).",1276660472

It's much more work on their part than either allowing, or blocking, everything (consider web-surfing like a flow state in programming, where having to decide whether to block an ad is an interruption that breaks flow. It's a tiny mental speed-bump that, when occurring often enough, greatly reduces overall mental velocity.)<p>And besides it being more work, it's also <i>annoying</i>, like you said; choosing to block everything removes the ""annoyance factor"" altogether. If you have a blanket-policy ad-blocker on, you never see the really, really bad ads that animate and have sound and make you hunt through your opened-in-the-background tabs to murder them. People don't like to be annoyed, and anything they can use to prevent themselves from getting annoyed in the first place will automatically be liked, even at the expense of the ability to find information in the future.<p>I'm not saying it's moral, or ideal, or anything like that—I'm just saying that webmasters will have to deal with (and work around) the fact that people <i>like</i> ad-blockers, for the same reason that people like eating fruit: it's a purely parasitic relationship where you take what you want, and the ""victim,"" seemingly static in relation to you, can't do anything about it.",1276659961

1434611,comment,1434509,1434509,0,0,cheald,,,"First off, that's awesome! It's so gratifying to see someone else discover that same spark that made me fall in love with programming. Keep it up - you'll love it.<p>Some suggestions for you:<p>* Find a community based in your interests. You'll find VB and C# communities around the web, and any number of IRC channels (look at irc.freenode.net - most development-oriented projects end up there). Find a channel and idle in it. Soak up tidbits of knowledge. Try to answer others' questions. Just participate in a community of developers, and you'll find yourself being spurred along.<p>* Find an open source project that interests you, and try your hand at contributing. Fix a bug, provide art resources, something to connect you to the project. There are lots and lots of people working on really neat things that could use help, and there's no better way to learn than to do.<p>* Build lots of toys. An apprentice doesn't end up building a cathedral his first year in the trade. Small projects - like your dad's need - are a wonderful way to practice. Each project will expose you to some new concept, and help you learn some new technique.<p>* Don't expect a CS degree to teach you about programming. CS is just that - the science of computers. You'll learn algorithms, compiler design, how processors work, and all sorts of stuff like that, but any actual development experience will be incidental, more likely than not. That's fine, as long as you realize that a CS degree is not a trade degree. It will augment your prowess as a developer, but it will not immediately make you one. That's up to you to cultivate.<p>* Don't expect to support yourself with it financially for a little while yet. I don't want to be discouraging, but once you enter into the business end of development, standards and expectations get much higher, and it can be very crushing if you don't have the tools in your belt yet to deal with them. If you can pick up small jobs here and there, do it, but don't look to make a career out of it with 6 months experience.<p>* Never stop learning. When you find yourself becoming comfortable, find something new to learn. A colleague of mine held the goal of learning and using a new language or technology stack every year. I've adopted that for myself, and it's wonderfully beneficial (this year is Android development). You will keep yourself exposed to new ideas, and continually widen your vision of the field.<p>* Just start running with it. An artist only develops their skill by drawing and drawing and drawing and drawing. A runner only develops endurance by running and running and running. A cook by cooking, a pilot by flying. There is no better teacher than experience. Some ideas to start yourself out might be an address book, an RSS reader, or a music player. Try your hand at a web application. Pick up a scripting language, like Ruby, Python, or Lua (you can use Lua to script .NET apps, so perhaps it's a good fit!). All you have to do is start <i>somewhere</i> and start doing it. You've started that with your dad's project - just keep it up now. You don't get to revolutionize the world on your second project ever, and that's okay. Your second project is a stepping stone to your eventual world-dominance app.<p>Good luck with it!",1276659159

Though I didn't make it clear, what concerns me are not the coarse technologies of life--wheels and pottery and what not--but more fine, non-obvious innovations. Consider concrete: with the dissolution of the Roman political structure the secrets of concrete were lost. It took 13 centuries, until the 1750s, to rediscover its formula. During that time, public works were greatly retarded. Indeed, the Anglo-Saxon (whose buildings rarely had windows for stability purposes) culture produced a rather famous poem we now call The Ruins in which Roman ruins are attributed to the works of giants.<p>What concerns me is not the transmitting of basic machines across the simplification of a society, to use Joseph Tainter's jargon, but, rather, difficult, contextual knowledge. Our knowledge of Mathematics, for example, was preserved by luck: the Byzantine Empire harbored enough learned individuals and archivists until such a time as the Crusades swept through. All of my work simply assumes an industrial, technological civilization with advanced computational capacity. Any textbooks I might produce in the future will have the implicit assumption of contemporary operating systems, compilers and hardware. If, through sheer chance, any of my potential works survived across a collapse they would be useless without further context.

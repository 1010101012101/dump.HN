If it&#x27;s really targeted at following news stories, watching a given page change is not as useful as some sort of tag-based or curated per-topic subscription.<p>One thing I&#x27;d find this useful for would be when you&#x27;re waiting for something to be released - point this at an author&#x27;s website (or a subpage related to a book you&#x27;re looking forward to) to be automatically notified when the page changes. Similarly, I think that Overdrive (e-book and audiobook lending through public libraries) has a page where it lists the libraries carrying a given book. If you&#x27;re hoping that your library starts carrying a given book, you could imagine following a page like that.<p>Another feature suggestion - maybe put in an option for a reminder to check back even if the page hasn&#x27;t changed either on some interval or after some period of time.

7985728,comment,7985252,7985586,13,0,Blahah,,,"Plant geneticist here. For the vast majority of Monsanto-licensed crops grown, the seed itself is the crop (e.g. maize). The farmers aren&#x27;t throwing it away, they sell it as food. For most of the remainder, although the seed isn&#x27;t the crop, the fruit, which contains the seeds, is the crop (e.g. aubergine, cotton). So farmers throwing away seed is unlikely.<p>Additionally, the previous most productive system of farming (and still very popular) was to use first-generation hybrids (the offspring of breeding two different strains together). Due to a phenomenon known as hybrid vigour, first-generation hybrids often have more desirable growth characteristics (like higher yield, bigger seeds, etc.). However, the effect only lasts one generation. Try to plant the second generation seeds and you&#x27;ll get relatively pathetic plants. But the hybrid breeding process is incredibly complex and hard to do at scale, so it&#x27;s worth paying a seed company to do it, even if that means buying the seed every year.<p>The license protection for GMOs serves a similar purpose: developing GM lines is really, really hard and expensive. If Monsanto and other producers couldn&#x27;t sell the seeds each year the technology simply wouldn&#x27;t happen - the licenses allow them to profit despite the massive R&D cost.",1404420779

7985719,comment,7983281,7984529,2,0,ABS,,,"I highly recommend to just get the book [1], it&#x27;s written very well and in layman terms but here&#x27;s an extract taken from a review [2] of the same:<p>&quot;Stout traces the birth of this “fable” to the “oversized effects of a single outdated and widely misunderstood judicial opinion.” Dodge v. Ford Motor Company was a 1919 decision of the Michigan Supreme Court. The opinion’s status as a meaningful legal precedent on the issue of corporate purpose is tenuous at best. Yet, its facts “are familiar to virtually every student who has taken a course in corporate law.” As Stout has observed in the past, “[t]he case is old, it hails from a state court that plays only a marginal role in the corporate law arena, and it involves a conflict between controlling and minority shareholders” more than an issue of corporate purpose generally.[11] The chapter explains quite well that any idea that corporate law, as a positive matter, affirmatively requires companies to maximize shareholder wealth turns out to be spurious. In fact, none of the three sources of corporate law (internal corporate law, state statutes and judicial opinions) expressly require shareholder primacy as most typically describe it. To the contrary, through the routine application of the business judgment rule, courts regularly provide prophylactic protection for the informed and non-conflicted decisions of corporate boards&quot;<p>[1] &quot;The Shareholder Value Myth: How Putting Shareholders First Harms Investors, Corportations, and the Public&quot; by Lynn Stout <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Shareholder-Value-Myth-Shareholders/dp/1605098132"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Shareholder-Value-Myth-Sharehold...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://arizonastatelawjournal.org/book-review-the-shareholder-value-myth-how-putting-shareholders-first-harms-investors-corporations-and-the-public-by-lynn-stout/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arizonastatelawjournal.org/book-review-the-shareholde...</a>",1404420740

We know that terrorist organizations are receptive to this style of attack because they have carried out this style of attack in other countries (Mumbai in 2008 and Kenya in 2013 are obvious examples).  Yet the two have yet to be combined in the US.<p>The only reason why this hasn&#x27;t happened in the US is that, contrary to popular belief, there just simply are not many people interested in doing this sort of thing in the US.

We are using the Doorkeeper OAuth2 gem which uses slightly different tokens and has some different features, though.<p>Couple of things/feature you might want to consider:<p>* You might want to track the expiration time of the tokens if the API provides it. If the token isn&#x27;t expired, potentially skip the verification step.<p>* Potentially you might want to add another HTTP interceptor that catches 401 (Unauthorized) responses. If a response returns a 401, you can prompt the user to re-authenticate and hold all HTTP requests until the user does. Then when there is a new token available, you can replay requests. This, coupled with saving the expiration time, can make page load times faster and still be robust.<p>* I&#x27;d make the HTTP interceptor that adds the Authorization header only add the header if the request URL is going to an API endpoint. The library user should be able to specify a function or regex that takes a URL string and returns true if the URL is an API url (and thus needs an Authorization header).

Specifically, a government (at least from a libertarian view) is any institution which exercises a monopoly on violence in a particular region. The mechanisms by which they maintain and exercise this monopoly serve to classify them.<p>This reduction is just a starting point though. It is to philosophies of government what evolution is to biology: a founding principle that serves as a lens to understand the rest of it. But there is much more to biology than just a knowledge of evolution, and likewise libertarian thinking.<p>Libertarians also, as a rule, follow the non-aggression principle and are not opposed to violence in all cases (e.g. self-defense, defense of others who did not initiate violence themselves, etc) [1]. This is a little less common amongst left-leaning libertarians, however.<p>> <i>&quot;Homesteading is wonderful in a system where land is unlimited, it can be seen as an extension of the moral right to the work of your own hands. But in a system where land is limited, the very act of appropriating does deny the resource to others&quot;</i><p>Any philosophy of government has to deal with the blunt fact that the world is one of finite resources. Libertarians of different stripes have a lot to say about property in various forms; it&#x27;s not something they always agree on. Libertarianism does not have as its direct goal maximizing the efficiency of resource usage, though many would argue that libertarian policies would have that result indirectly. Virtually all would argue that privately owned resources are at least available to others via the market (i.e. for a price), whereas any resource that is publicly monopolized is only available to others if the controlling government decides to share it (which is more likely in democratic societies, but not by their nature, required).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism#Personal_autonomy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism#Personal_autonom...</a>",1404419628

For my case it was paying the bill with a credit card. You can type it into the automated system, but if you insist on tying up a human just to dictate your card number to them, then they charge you the $5.<p>When I talked to the human to explain something on the bill that I wasn&#x27;t understanding, they were helpful and didn&#x27;t charge me the $5, even when we discovered I needed to pay a little more and I paid it through him.<p>This is similar to banks who charge people for doing ATM class transactions with a human teller.

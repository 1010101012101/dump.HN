I don&#x27;t think allowing opinions means you disclaim all responsibility to objectivity. Just because you can&#x27;t achieve objectivity doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t strive for it. A search for truth involves striving to rise above parochial and partial concerns, particularly in reporting on wars or nations in conflict.<p><i>Naturally, their writing will tend to have that bias.</i><p>As editors and journalists, they should strive to rise above it, that&#x27;s their job, not the readers&#x27;. That&#x27;s not to say they shouldn&#x27;t have an opinion, but that it should be informed, clearly stated and not an attempt to distort the truth as they see it or insert their own narrative. Personally I think it&#x27;s time for a new global journalism, without attempts to filter the truth and pick a side amongst often unpalatable narratives presented by national governments.",1381841608

The issue, however, is really one of degree, and that is important for people at the hard edge of poverty. Whether it is going to take 1, 10, or 100 years for the conditions in a given region to improve <i>matters</i> to people who have so little money to live on that they can&#x27;t afford to send their children to school, or pay for proper housing. If there is no money left over for workers to improve their lot because they are living at subsistence level, which is distressingly common, then the development process you describe cannot take place.<p>Distorting the free market in order to temporarily redistribute wealth downwards, with the goal of speeding up the process of improvement, is in my view an ethical action. An example of the kind of distortion that I think could be appropriate is supporting an oversight organisation along the lines of the Forest Stewardship Council. Bodies like that are by no means perfect, and are themselves often subject to market pressures, however they seem to me to be a pretty good balance of economic freedom and social ethics.<p>A slight aside; it strikes me that a not insignificant proportion of the increase in wealth that we enjoy has come not from people being able to afford more of everything, but rather from technological progress in methods of producing things. So for example the desk on which my computer sits is a fairly cheap affair constructed from what looks to me like veneered MDF. I do not have a nice oak writing desk, because those are still very expensive. The same kind of comparison applies to almost everything I own that has a historical counterpart: food, clothing, furniture, writing materials.<p>My point is that my increased &quot;apparent&quot; wealth seems to be driven as much by these technical improvements as by an increase in &quot;actual&quot; wealth (I wouldn&#x27;t dare guess the actual ratio beyond saying that I feel the factors are comparable). Furthermore, I am confident in saying that technological improvement is not predicated on market freedom on the basis that there have, historically, been civilisations who have undergone technological improvement without free markets: the Romans being one example amongst many. I would also point out that we don&#x27;t have enough data to know whether the current burst of technological improvement was dependent in any way on market freedom, because we only really have one data point: this particular rise of standards.<p>To return to your question about an ethical supplier: it kind of depends on your taste. My partner is Indian and I seem to end up getting my clothes on visits there these days, mostly as a result of laziness whilst here. Fabindia is one supplier that seems to put quite a lot of effort into ensuring good conditions in their supply chain, though they don&#x27;t have the range you&#x27;d expect from a western supplier (they do seem to ship internationally though, not sure about stores). There are lots of workers cooperatives in Kerala, where my partner is from, so all the stuff they make must get on to the market somehow! Also, I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re aware but somewhat coincidentally NPR&#x27;s Planet Money are doing a series of podcasts and associated things on t-shirts, and the economics of the global t-shirt trade, that sounds like it&#x27;s going to be quite interesting.<p>Sorry for the long post :-|",1381840355

Till they bleed out of an ulcer, or die at a ridiculously high and young rate from stomach cancer.  If your allergen blood test measures off the charts, and the gastroenterologist does a biopsy and its all inflamed, even if you claim to &quot;feel fine&quot; it would be dumb to keep eating wheat.  With my son it was a little more obvious as wheat products made him explode out both ends, eventually resulting in the two medical tests above.  As advice its along the lines of, if you feel OK, then no need to take your blood pressure meds, or if you feel OK then no need to take your psych meds that day, or if you feel OK then no need to finish your course of antibiotics.  I wouldn&#x27;t really go there, even as satire.<p>Farmers use grains to fatten mammal livestock, about 2/3 the human mammal population in the USA could stand to lose a bit of weight, and wheat is a grain, so cutting grains is a truly great idea for about 2/3 the population regardless of allergy.  I&#x27;m perfectly fine with gluten but I lost some excess weight anyway when we went mostly GF at home.<p>Gluten is not an essential nutrient.  You&#x27;ll be perfectly healthy without it.  Now I suppose some flake out there could propose a diet where you consume zero vitamin C until you&#x27;re admitted into a hospital with scurvy...  Although that kind of flakiness does exist in other situations, its perfectly safe not to eat gluten containing foods.  The only real danger is wasting lots of money on expense artificially GF foods, which I advise against doing other than for social situations, and the danger of losing some weight.<p>One point where I agree totally with you in fact, but not in outlook, is the infantilizing subject.  Infants are going to be infants.  Can&#x27;t be bothered to take chemistry because you&#x27;d like someone else to do your thinking for you, thats called being an infant.  Can&#x27;t be bothered to learn anything about nutrition other than directly or indirectly paid advertisements, thats called infantile behavior.  Babies are going to be babies, thats just what they do.  No point blaming the messenger or the topic, a moron is quite capable of finding another way to do something moronic without anyone&#x27;s encouragement.  So getting nutritional advice from Hollywood stars is just what infants naturally do; after all they learned about vaccines and autism from the same folks.  Normal behavior is not a problem.  That behavior being normal for lazy/dumb people is the problem.",1381839425

Your next point is a good example of why :<p>> Here in Austin, we have 8x4 DOCSIS3 to the building. That’s about 340MBit/s down.<p>Pause here, this is a faulty assumption. Yes, your buildings <i>line</i> is capable of 340Mbit/s down. But your line is (probably) never maxed out like that.<p>For a provider to offer you 340Mb dedicated to your building, they&#x27;d have to pay for a dedicated 340mb to your building. I don&#x27;t know the prices in Austin, but in Urban Michigan, just getting a 200x200mb backhaul connection costs roughly about $2,000 to $2,600/month.<p>If there are ten units in your building, to let your building share 200x200 would mean your ISP would have to have a backhaul cost of $200 to $260 per unit, just on backhaul alone!<p>(That doesn&#x27;t include the cost to have copper in the building, or the cost for the ISP to get that backhaul from their data center to your buildings demark, or the cost to have your traffic routed / shaped nicely, or the cost for a telephone operator to offer you support, ect)<p>I presume your buildings units are residential; if that&#x27;s true, there&#x27;s no way your paying $300 or more per unit for home internet, so your ISP likely can&#x27;t even afford to provide a 200mbit line to your building. They likely have a line <i>capable</i> of 300+, but with service only capable of around 100mbit at the highest.<p>That also assumes you can even get all the units to subscribe to the ISP service. Comcast / Charter / Time Warner / ect can make that assumption because they have a monopoly. But any players smaller than them, can&#x27;t make that assumption. We might only get 20-50% of the units in a building to switch, which (if we&#x27;re still delivering 200mb to the building) doubles the per-unit expenses to about $400/month each.<p>Remember, your not just sharing the line, your also sharing the backhaul (the ISP&#x27;s connection to the internet at large).<p>>This seems absurd to me, to the point of being unbelievable..., connecting an arbitrary business to a fully-connected residential network will always be cheaper than connecting an arbitrary residence to a fully-connected business network.<p>This might in theory be true if you have a government blessed monopoly. (Even then, the margins on business service are much higher and cover the lower margins on residential)<p>But if your ISP is any smaller than Comcast, you probably don&#x27;t have this. So you won&#x27;t get every house in a residential area. Which means you&#x27;ll be paying for a fully-connected residential network, but only collecting revenue on 20-50% of those houses. Which means you&#x27;ll be paying for lines connected to hundreds of homes which you collect zero revenue on. (Remember, each foot of that network is 33cents, regardless if it&#x27;s in use, regardless of whether you&#x27;ve subscribed service on it).<p>Businesses subsidize residential use. The degree to which that happens fluctuates wildly (Comcast for instance, can also use high-margin HBO and TV / pay-per-view / other subscriptions to subsidize their residential costs. &quot;Pure ISPs&quot; cant do that).<p>> Can I run an HTTP server? I have no idea. Can I use 2TB a month? No clue.<p>If you don&#x27;t understand the agreement you signed, call your cable company. They will very clearly tell you &quot;no&quot; and suggest you buy a business class service (which should spell out the extra restrictions you&#x27;ve removed -- or at least, Comcast Business Class does here)<p>> if you think being &quot;clear&quot; and &quot;fair&quot; is standard business practice for ISPs in the United States you need a real reality check.<p>We&#x27;re arguing two different things here. Your saying &quot;my ISP is evil, they use X, Y, Z to do evil, therefore, X, Y, and Z are evil&quot;<p>I get that. I&#x27;m <i>not</i> defending Comcast / AT&T / other shitty ISP&#x27;s. I&#x27;m fully aware that Comcast crazy oversells backhaul in many markets, or is super overzealous on what they allow home users to do. (I live with this reality every day -- Comcast is the only ISP at my home).<p>But those things aren&#x27;t evil because Comcast / AT&T use them for evil. If Comcast hops into an fast car and hits a bunch of pedistrians, that doesn&#x27;t make &quot;fast cars&quot; evil. It makes <i>Comcast</i> evil.<p>Bandwidth caps aren&#x27;t inherently evil, they&#x27;re a useful way for low-volume users to save cash on their connection. Shared connections aren&#x27;t inherently evil, they&#x27;re a useful way for home users to get faster burst speeds that they normally couldn&#x27;t afford.<p>Does Comcast use those restrictions to do evil things? Absolutely. Does Comcast lie about their restrictions, or purposly mislead folks around them. Certainly. Should ISP&#x27;s be infinitely more transparent about their pricing and services? Absolutely! (and some already are).<p>Should we abolish these things just because Comcast uses them for evil? Not at all.",1381839329

But this strikes me as a beautiful truth that rewards careful pondering.<p>A library containing all possible books may contain all the gems of knowledge in the world, but it also contains far more nonsense: Books full of random letters that mean nothing, as well as real books with changes made to them, both unnoticeable and noticeable. Such a library, though containing all information, would not contain any information about which books contain real information and which do not. A single real book, though, while it may contain factual errors, can at least be guaranteed to contain the beliefs and assumptions of its author, which is more than you can say about the infinite library.<p>Look at it this way: an infinite list of strings containing all possible strings (or even a finite list of strings containing all possible strings shorter than a given length) contains less information than a program or essay that I wrote, because the infinite list gives no indication about which strings are ""important"", ""informational"" or ""useful"", while my one essay or program contains concise, easily-extractable information intended for a particular purpose.<p>One more example, just for fun: Imagine I'm a stupid bank robber who keeps all the plans for my heists and the names of my partners in one Word document on my hard drive. If the police arrest me, they have enough information to send me and my partners to jail. However, imagine that I've written a program that makes a million copies of my secret plan and changes the names and locations inside all of the copies to random values. Now, if I get caught, without knowing which document is real and which are fake, the authorities don't have any useful information.",1290127806

The girl's mom, Sarah Sense-Wilson, agreed...<p>The child misunderstood the terminology being used and the parent likely didn't read the book to comprehend the difference. However, on face value we have no way of understanding the full situation. Is this a school with a high-percentage of native students where the terminology, time and time again will be misunderstood?<p>Just because this is the first student to complain and the first parent to be a decent enough (if misguided) parent to actually follow through with their child's complaint, doesn't mean this isn't the first child to be turned off in this school from the terminology.<p>Change 'Savage' to Nigger and you'll offend black students in other areas, perhaps Chink and you'll offend Asian students. It just happens that this book has bad terminology for the students that were reading it that is preventing at least this student from getting to the meaning behind the words.<p>Furthermore, this could all have been avoided by <i>competent teachers</i>.

The killer part is that parties must oppose each other: if party A is for something, party B must find a reason why it's fracked (insert long story about messaging and branding here).

1919962,comment,1918553,1919763,0,0,moe,,,"<i>MySQL has had years to evolve their approach and to fix bugs.</i><p>That sounds nice in theory, but completely ignores the reality of the respective code-bases. Features in MySQL have a tendency to rot rather than mature. It could hardly become more obvious than in the comparison between this version 1 of postgres replication against the ""evolved"" MySQL equivalent.<p>Postgres may have the smaller feature set, it may be the first version, yet I'm still inclined to trust it a lot more than what MySQL has to offer. 
Simply because postgres has a track-record of being rock solid and MySQL, well, not so much.<p>Sure, in theory you can build fancy rings, cascades and even multi-master topologies in MySQL. But what is that worth when even the simplest master/slave mode still randomly and silently desyncs in various, undocumented situations?<p><i>Statement based replication has its faults, but complexity isn't one of them.</i><p>There's a nice quote from Alan Perlis:<p><pre><code>    Fools ignore complexity,
    experts avoid it;
    geniuses remove it.
</code></pre>
Some complexity is inherent to replication. The question remains which parts, if any, they removed and which parts they ignored...<p><i>It's not a joke. There is more documentation.</i><p>Sorry, measuring documentation in terms of quantity sounds like yet another joke to me. As you can tell by my snarky comments I'm responsible for babysitting the odd MySQL cluster in my day-job (and postgres, too, so I have a frame of reference). It is indeed true that for most common problems I'll find the solution not in the official docs but rather on some more or less obscure forum, in broken english, linked from page >3 of the google search results (after 2 pages of outdated and plain wrong information).<p>So, in all fairness, yes, most <i>common</i> problems can eventually be solved that way. But good luck debugging a not so common ring, multi-master or otherwise non-standard scenario that way. Or encoding issues. Or silent truncation. Or hotbackups that are strangely much smaller than they should be. Or the dreaded 'mysql'-database being screwed after restoring a backup to a newer minor-version...<p>Anyways, the way postgres handles this seems more sensible to me. In postgres the overwhelming majority of the ""common"" MySQL-issues simply doesn't exist.",1290127413

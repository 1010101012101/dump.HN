Beyond simple addition, that's the second most common thing I have to calculate (finance related), and going back to excel and trying to remember the formula names is a pain.

417427,comment,416647,417247,0,0,gruseom,,,"While I agree that JS probably can't be treated like a machine language and just ignored, my project has gotten huge value out of the generated-JS approach.<p>I see from another comment that you've used GWT. This may be why our experience differs. Java and Javascript are so far apart (ironic given their names) that to generate one from the other is inevitably going to be complex. We use Parenscript, and the semantics of Lisp and JS are much closer. As a result, I've been consistently surprised by how suitable JS has proven as a target language and how simple the whole approach is.<p>We've even extended Parenscript into a pretty expressive subset of Common Lisp compiling efficiently to Javascript. We never set out to do this - it just spontaneously evolved - and it's a small subset, nowhere near all of CL. But it covers enough that we can write large portions of our app to run both on the server and in the client, which turns out to be valuable sometimes.<p>That being said, we pay close attention to the generated Javascript, so I agree with your suspicion of X-to-JS compilers in that sense. What we do is a semi-abstraction.",1230915380

For all its flaws, JS retains enough of their DNA to have given rise to the wonderful world of web apps and, effectively, take over the world. When you consider how many historical accidents went <i>against</i> this style, I think we're lucky to have JS. And it does seem to have been an accident, given how hard Eich has been trying to turn it in to something else (for ""serious"" programming don't you know).<p>p.s.

417406,comment,417260,417395,0,0,JimmyL,,,"A similar case that comes up every few years has to do with copyrighting the phone book. The publisher contends that while the information contained within it is indeed not copyrightable, the arrangement and ordering of it is, and so you can't just recopy it and republish it for free. The wannabe publisher says that it's free information in no meaningful order, so they can republish it all they want. And then they go to court, and whatever happens happens...<p>Another example (and similar to the one you mention) is Carl Malamud's public.resource.org - he's taking WestLaw's court records, removing the copyrighted bits, and publishing them himself online. The problem then becomes how to cite them, since WestLaw's numbering system is somewhat of a de factor standard.<p>All-in, you're quite right - this is nowhere near as clear as the article thinks it is, and it's certainly not a domain that I'd rely on a non-lawyer's opinion for.",1230914117

It further's Congress' continual confusion between ""cars people will buy"", ""cars good for the environment"", and ""cars automakers are actually making""... that's <i>three</i> distinct categories, and it is wrong to collapse them. (The most frequent collapse is that ""cars people want to buy"" are ""good for the environment"". This is wishful thinking. People will prefr good fuel economy, <i>all else being equal</i>, but they're not going to pay twice as much or give up those little niceties like ""a heater"". Hold the auto companies to this wishful thinking, as Congress wants, and you might as well just finish digging their grave and throw them in.)<p>Watch the switcho-changeo in action: ""Detroit's goal has never been to sell the cars that consumers want to buy; it's been to sell the cars that will yield the highest profits.

Yeah, <i>that's</i> the path to success alright!<p>And why on Earth would the startups <i>want</i> to deal with the unions? Almost by definition of ""union"", they do not. That was just gibberish. They may <i>have</i> to deal with unions (ideally a nice new one, IMHO, UAW 2.0 to go with Car 2.0), and hopefully they learn from how UAW 1.0 badly hurt their host, but <i>wanting</i> to deal with a union is just stupid-talk.

Defining every job down to the n-th degree so theres no flexibility, aka ""work rules"", and creating thousands and thousands of wasted worker-days per day: deadly.)<p>Unions aren't free.

I would be unsurprised to find that a car that meets his specification already exist, but is hidden by the wide range of options and alternatives offered by the various manufacturers (the curse of choice). So what the author is really asking for is for a manufacturer to pair-down their range and only offer one car, in black... While this might be possible for a start-up this is not possible for any of the large car companies. My example would be the Smart car, started with one design, and now has at least three or four different offerings to diversify their customer base.<p>Can anyone provide an example of an industry where choice has been significantly reduced over time?<p>Link to original article: <a href=""http://tbm.thebigmoney.com/articles/judgments/2008/12/29/next-years-model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tbm.thebigmoney.com/articles/judgments/2008/12/29/nex...</a>",1230912054

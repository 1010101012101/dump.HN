I was also on the same page as to having a really amazing design for our app/start (Mugasha.com). I am not a designer myself, I am developer/UI/UX guy although, I have an appreciation for good design ethics. There are two ways to go about it, One is what 280North did and hire these mini-studios. They are great, focused and quite talented. Make sure its a mini one, big ones are not very focused. The second is the path I choose and found a designer in our local are through networking and events and made him a partner. This is tough, I am giving away a quarter of my company to a designer who I trust. I am also making him responsible and take ownership of the design and UI. Its a collaborative effort in the end but the best thing to do would be to hire someone who is good and who you can trust.",1224147466

And post it all on the net.<p>That's just flagrant, and disrespecting society to be honest.<p>Nik had the potential to be a lasting media darling.  In the Aussie IT scene entrepreneurs with charisma are thin on the ground and even with a failed startup under his belt he would have had an enviable reputation.  He probably would have found himself sitting on boards as a non-executive director, or having VCs tripping over themselves to be a part of his next venture.<p>The lesson: be respectful in business.",1224145920

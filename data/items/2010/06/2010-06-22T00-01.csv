I often encounter code with about 60 lines of legalese in the header.

Make sure anybody you show it to knows this stuff.""<p>I thought, awesome.  Why don't my EULAs have a paragraph like that?<p>Rule of law was a good idea.  It's still a good idea.

If you're worried about the price of rent, you could consider living outside of the city. While living in SF is probably more desirable you can live south in places like Mountain view, Palo Alto, Daly City or over in the East Bay like Berkley, Fremont, etc. You'll easily be paying half your rent if you choose to live outside of the city. If you don't bring a car, or sell it when you get here you can still take BART or CalTrain into the city for events and for interviews.<p>Hopefully this helps. :)",1277165690

My initial thought was to target reputable blogging freelancers and make them the initial group. I was also thinking that maybe also allowing open enrollment, but only allowing open enrollment individuals to bid for extremely small projects (under $500, so if the minimum allowable rate is $50hr then 10hr projects) this would allow them to build rank slowly, as well if a member uses them for services they can up them to an invited status. As well I have formulated the idea that a member is forever linked to their invites. If you invite someone to the site and they do good your recommendation rank goes up, if they are bad your recommendation rank goes down. If it gets too low you are no longer allowed to invite people, as it gets higher you are allowed to invite more people. This has no bearing on your abilities rank (which is what gets you gigs). My other thought is new members get feed smaller projects and as their ability rank grows then they are feed larger projects. As well, I think I would go with pure rank not a pure customer satisfaction indicator one bad project can ruin an otherwise good freelancer on the site and lets face it at some point for whatever reason, you are going to run into a bad project. I think the site could make money by being a paid verification service where we would charge a fee to certify that the code is of good quality and we act as PM's to make sure the project is tracking to the schedule.",1277165444

Math is a lot easier to pick up after you know how to program. In fact, if you're a halfway decent programmer, you'll find it's almost a snap.<p>2. They teach math all wrong in school. Way, WAY wrong. If you teach yourself math the right way, you'll learn faster, remember it longer, and it'll be much more valuable to you as a programmer.<p>3. Knowing even a little of the right kinds of math can enable you do write some pretty interesting programs that would otherwise be too hard. In other words, math is something you can pick up a little at a time, whenever you have free time.<p>4. Nobody knows all of math, not even the best mathematicians. The field is constantly expanding, as people invent new formalisms to solve their own problems. And with any given math problem, just like in programming, there's more than one way to do it. You can pick the one you like best.<p>5. Math is... ummm, please don't tell anyone I said this; I'll never get invited to another party as long as I live. But math, well...

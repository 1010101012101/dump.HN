I could never get the 10 songs or so I downloaded and paid for to play on my Windows 98 PC, despite downloading what they recommended (I don't think the version of Windows Media Player they suggested worked on my PC). I still wanted music to play on my Sony CLIE (which couldn't play it either)... and my friend showed me a computer magazine talking about Limewire. It said something about it being safe and legal, as long as you didn't use it illegally. I didn't consider the implications so I downloaded it  and tried it.. and quickly found a bunch of music. I actually owned a lot of it, but not all of it. The point is, I was underinformed and since there wasn't much of a warning in the magazine I considered reputable, I didn't think I was doing anything illegal.<p>When you look at the target audience of a simple magazine like PC Magazine, I see why the RIAA would be alarmed. I'm not saying this should be illegal to publish or that PC Magazine is necessarily at fault, but I don't think the RIAA is too far off-base either.",1290641141

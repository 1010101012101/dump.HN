46363,comment,46024,46293,0,0,geebee,,,"There are so many reasons to give up, and ""I can't program"" is one of them.  ""I'm too old"", ""I'm too inexperienced"" seem to be a couple of popular ones.  <p>There are advantages and disadvantages, and I admire every person who decides to put everything he/she has into it.<p>That said, we don't have to work this one out through logic - we can look out into the world and observe.  Think of the top ten start-ups that IPO'd or were bought last year, and take a look at the bio's who founded them.  The numbers don't look good for founders who can't program.    <p>Thing is, hacking <i>is</i> something you can learn to do.  You can't make yourself younger, or taller, but there's nothing stopping you from downloading ruby (or, if you have a mac, opening a console) and get to it. <p>It does take a while to learn to program - but if it didn't, then it wouldn't be much of an advantage.    <p>If you really don't want to go through it, there are certainly some notable successes for non-programmers.  If you can add a lot of value as a founder and help make a lot of people successful, then go for it.  ",1187987141

The core functionality should be useful.. maybe the site should be accentuating different things than what it is currently.

All of these things have a place in a software startup.  If you're good at all of them, you're golden (because most hackers decidedly aren't).<p>But, at the end of the day, the most expensive and time-consuming thing that software startups need from the outset is software development.  Other than design, there's not a lot of need for other skills before you manage to create a product that people want to have.<p>But I'd echo the sentiment mentioned elsewhere.  Dabble in programming and see if you're enjoy it.  If you don't, focus on your strengths.",1187986197

Regulators could start to treat hobby planes like 747s, as far as the difficulty of selling them and getting them off the ground.<p>It would be wise in the DIY community to show that trying to stop people is a waste of time. Real security solutions require innovation. An example: SAMs are by far still the easiest and cheapest way to take out a plane. But we spend many billions on stopping 7 year olds with safety scissors. <p>I think it's up to innovators to show how to make things really secure, or demonstrate that there is no such thing, and best to avoid the pretense and waste.",1187986098
46351,comment,46024,46345,0,0,rms,,,"In this case the distinction between outsourcing and offshoring gets fuzzy because making the logo was not something that was previously done by Kevin Rose's company, because Kevin Rose's company didn't do any internal logo development or hire any local companies to do logo development. I don't think a correct use of the word offshoring requires crossing an ocean, it seems to be accepted that it just means a different country, even if the word itself doesn't imply this meaning.<p>I'll agree that outsourcing is a more appropriate term, I used the word offshoring in my initial post without thinking because I thought (incorrectly) it was less politically charged than outsourcing. I'm going to agree with SwellJoe and say that there's something inherently xenophobic about the word offshoring.",1187985772

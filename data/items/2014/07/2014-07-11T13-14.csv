Hell, I see the event chain as a not-unlikely consolation prize that &quot;we&quot; defeated an opponent of patent reform at least, even if the patent reform legislation failed.<p>But also, we were so badly defeated on the legislative front, the White House could have wanted to test if they needed to switch positions based on relative political strength, if we couldn&#x27;t stop the nomination.<p>Having just gotten back from DC to talk startup visa implementation, it&#x27;s been underlined to me how much goes on under the surface in that town...",1405087176

We&#x27;re going to publish a detailed report in August with everything in it.<p>To answer one of your questions, the predicted desktop rate is based on an assumption that adblock adoption is driven by word of mouth (we have a basis for this assumption), and a compound growth rate is fitted to raw adblock rate data.<p>It&#x27;s hard to combine the google trends data into the same model, because it&#x27;s just a picture of search volume, not total adblock installations. I think it would be a fair to assume that the growth rate of new installations would match the growth rate of search volume, which means that the growth rate of 65% we&#x27;re seeing this year is higher than it would have been in previous years.<p>Finally, I want to acknowledge that nothing can grow exponentially forever!

8020009,comment,8019513,8019513,1,0,netcan,,,"This is based on adsense partner network earnings, which is a small section of the total online advertising market. I don&#x27;t think you can reach conclusions about online advertising in general (which is all affected by adblocking) from this.<p>Adblock may be playing a role, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what this data shows.<p>Several reasons:<p>_ 1 the centralization of the web. Adsense was built for the long tail web. Today&#x27;s web is much more centralized with more impressions going to fewer, bigger sites. Google themselves play a few roles here. They run some of the big sites sucking up the traffic. Their search results are increasingly directing people to the big sites.<p>Fewer blogs more circles and tweets.<p>The data cited is from Google&#x27;s quarterly results. Taken as a whole the data seems to support this theory.<p><pre><code>  Q1-2014 &#x27;Sites Revenues&#x27; : $10.47 billion, a 21% increase over Q1-2013\n  Q1-2014 &#x27;Partner Revenues&#x27; : $3.40  billion, a 4% increase over Q1-2013\n\n  Q1-2013 &#x27;Sites Revenues&#x27; : $8.64 billion, a 18% increase over Q1-2012\n  Q1-2013 &#x27;Partner Revenues&#x27; : $3.26 billion billion, a 12% increase over Q1-2012\n 4% increase in Network Revenues.  \n</code></pre>\nOverall, the growth in ad revenue actually accelerated from 19% to 22%. The growth just shifted from the partner network to Google&#x27;s own network. Both are similarly affected by adblocking. There isn&#x27;t an overall slowdown.<p>- 2. The market adsense ads are a part of is competitive, much more so than search.<p>For search ads, Google&#x27;s reach, platform quality and ad quality is best by far. There is no competition. For content network ads,  Google&#x27;s inventory (the sites displaying adsense ads) and the platform is nothing special.<p>Competition is growing. Social media (including Google&#x27;s own sites) advertising is the biggest new source of competition. In-app ads are anther. Those &#x27;you might also like&#x27; content recommendation ads you might find on news sites on are another source are another growing segment 9and an important way of picking up that one weird trick for flatter bellies).<p>Facebook  is the real elephant in <i>this</i> room. Facebook ads work. The platform is improving and marketers are learning how to use it.  They have an enormous inventory. They have user data enabling really powerful (or scary, depending on your perspective) targeting. Since so many Facebook users check in multiple times per day, campaigns can target (and report on) daily impressions and such.<p>Facebook ads work in ways other ads don&#x27;t. A lot of ad dollars are flowing into Facebook, some would have gone to adsense.<p>_ 3 &quot;content network&quot; ads on adsense are in the more direct competition for ad dollars with the offline world than most online ads. This is a volatile market segment. Blue chip advertisers can cut 7-8 figure budgets to zero in a bad year (like 2011). On a smaller scale, it&#x27;s still a volatile market<p>I&#x27;m not saying that adblocking doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;m sure it does. But these are two noisy datasets you are looking at. You need to correlate different things to make this point. Maybe earning per 1m pageviews for some site.",1405085516

Further that new job might not require that you move to avoid surveillance.  Also many/most employers don&#x27;t care enough about specifically where all their employees are to do such a thing.  Finally a lot of the employers who do care enough have implemented ID badges.  ID badges don&#x27;t necessarily give you a happy feeling inside since they make it obvious that management doesn&#x27;t trust everyone equally.  But at least the tracking that they do is explicit: you know you&#x27;re getting logged every time you badge through a door.<p>Imagine the outcry if a city implemented a badge ID system that you needed just to travel anywhere.

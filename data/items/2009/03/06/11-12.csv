Then take a look at the first 200 or so users who digg the story - and ban them all.This isn't particularly efficient, because of the rate usocial charges ($314 - 400 votes). But having identified the users, digg could then look for patterns in the ip addresses, or ways the users navigate the site, and use those patterns to identify the rest of the usocial accounts.<p>It surprises me a startup like usocial gets funding in this economy (if they did). Seems like it's an incredibly fragile business model - not only are they relying on a third party, but it's in that third party's best interest to make things as difficult for you as they can...",1236339861

This claim \n   is denied. Nobody gives gigabytes of memory to \n   each qmail-smtpd process, so there is no problem \n   with qmail's assumption that allocated array \n   lengths fit comfortably into 32 bits.

It will put further pressure on the number of patients she can see.  You could employ someone else to transcribe her notes at a salary more reasonable for the work but it is still, or at least should be, an unnecessary overhead.<p>Digital photos are a good idea although frequently details are sometimes difficult to pick out so I would say it's vital that any system makes it trivial to annotate the images.",1236337482

5694175,comment,5693365,5693778,6,0,blinkingled,,,">other operating systems have caught up, while NT was pretty close to its present design even in the early 90s<p>The one thing you will find almost as a theme with Linux design is that there is minimum of ""future"" it. That applies to most of the Linux user space as well. This is a good thing and a bad thing.<p>For example multi-gpu systems with multiple outputs were not taken into consideration when both the Kernel and Xorg parts were designed. They took the most common usecase of single GPU, probably made some assumptions around it and coded something that works for that usecase.<p>Microsoft, on the other hand (almost out of necessity) had to actually design the NT Kernel while making no assumptions - multi GPUs may not have existed when XP was released but none the less MS had to design for the eventual reality when some OEM will stuff 2 GPUs and will have to write drivers for it without Microsoft being able to change the XP kernel design or even implementation in any way. I am sure the same can be said about scalability - when massively multicore CPUs weren't around NT kernel was mostly up for task of supporting them, whereas Linux adopted with lot of scalability related work that followed after the fact. (Remember the early NT vs Linux benchmarks?)<p>Designing for future is bad because it comes with certain baggage and to an extent added upfront costs. It is good for future compatibility, code maturity and obviously saves rewrite efforts - you don't have to rip off all the code and start over and take care not to break existing software etc. There is less code churn in Windows world I am sure than there is in the Linux world where people are constantly adopting to new realities. This creates an environment ripe for new bugs, instability and only with the amount of volunteer effort the cost factor can be lesser than prohibitively expensive.",1368366231

5694113,comment,5688151,5688774,2,0,prirun,,,"I wrote an emulator for a Prime minicomputer (1975-1992 era).  The Prime had built-in instructions for process coordination via semaphores.  So when a process issued a WAIT instruction to wait on an event (semaphore), the microcode scheduler looked through the ready list to find the next eligible process to run.  At the end of the ready list is the ""backstop"" process, the lowest priority process; it is always ready to run.  The backstop process would look through other scheduling queues (just a semaphore with a list of processes waiting on it) for processes that had exhausted their timeslice, give them a new timeslice, and execute the NFYE instruction to put the process on the ready list.  The NFYE instruction would actually switch to the new process, because that process had a higher priority than the backstop process.<p>There was a periodic timer process on the Prime, that ran at the highest priority.  It was used for things like waking up driver processes periodically, in case an IO device was hung and didn't interrupt like it should have, and for waking up processes that were sleeping until a certain time passed (sleep call).<p>I think it was advanced for its time.

Have been a few that come close, but just not jumped out at me.<p>That said I'm still awaiting for something of that form factor with some modern love.<p>That all said if Mr Linux Linus is happy with a chromebook as a dev machince, then they must be doing something right, though a Chrome pixel just for SSH would be fiscal perversion on my budget.",1368363914

And if someone would think, that because they are disallowing media, they have something to hide, while indeed they have! but would you allow your neighbor to come inside your house, and get the truth about any fight you had within your family?",1368363835
5694092,comment,5693740,5693740,3,0,philtar,,,"I work for a telecom regulatory authority of a nearby country. We have the basically the same laws. Let me clarify some misconceptions:<p>- This law applies to companies that provides VOIP services. They're usually not enforced if the VOIP services you provide are not side stepping the main telecom company's systems. i.e No, connected straight to broadvoice. You may use VOIP for an internet PBX system.<p>- This is because the majority of the telecom company's profits are from international calls. In a country where >50% of the population is not nationals, that is a gigantic source of revenue. The single biggest source of profit for the telecom companies. The telecom authority wants to protect the major company because the market is not yet stable. Half of these telecom companies would shut down if they weren't backed by the government.<p>- The Lawful Interception law is nonsense (legally). It may very well be the case but I have no idea about it and neither does anyone else in the regulatory authority (we do hear a lot of rumors about it, though). Maybe the higher ups know what the deal is but for us, this is a non-issue.",1368363797

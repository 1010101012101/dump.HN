Here&#x27;s what works for me:<p>- Fitness: Eat reasonably and stay in good physical condition (I box and run). I enjoy food but eating in moderation is important as you age.<p>- Other interests: I&#x27;ve worked as a professional musician since I was 18, a parallel career. After 20 years of working as a guitarist, I&#x27;ve recently embarked on learning upright bass. it&#x27;s wonderful, and mind opening.<p>- Varied career: I&#x27;ve been very fortunate to have played a lot of different roles, doing all kinds of development, management, etc. It&#x27;s easy to get stuck in a rut and not challenge yourself with new experiences, don&#x27;t let this happen.<p>- Self awareness: I have a natural inclination to work on things I&#x27;m not good at, but have also learned over the years to play to my strengths. This is one of the great advantages of getting older.",1439240398

It seems like concentrating Google&#x27;s ad revenue in a smaller, more efficient business unit is a nod to Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s method of business.<p>I can&#x27;t recall this sort of thing happening in my lifetime, so it will be really interesting to see how this plays out. I also wonder how this would be treated if Google didn&#x27;t have the crazy corporate structure they have now (where public shares are essentially non-equity and non-voting).<p><a href=""http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/the-many-classes-of-google-stock/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/the-many-classe...</a><p>Edit: I am reasonably certain this is a tax and liability optimization strategy. It allows their more risky units to operate with separate liability from their cash cow.<p>Edit 2: I&#x27;m actually surprised the stock value hasn&#x27;t tanked because most of the future potential of Google just got moved outside of the company. How much of Google&#x27;s future value was based on X? I would say a non-trivial amount of the stock price is the anticipation of future profits, which are now no longer a part of the company the stock is intended to index.<p>Edit 3: Disregard Edit 2, I misread the release the second time through and assumed X was not part of the company :).",1439240382

10037179,comment,10030796,10036901,0,0,trsohmers,,,"To broadly cover most of what you brought up, we think our &quot;secret sauce&quot; that both will allow us to actual make a commercially viable processor and allow us to compete is the fact that we are developing some very advanced software in house taking advantage of many new techniques. I can&#x27;t go into  too many details, but we actually think we have developed what is close to the long talked about and &quot;magic&quot; compiler.<p>When it comes to something like the X1 you have to remember NVIDIA loves exaggerating their benchmark results. In reality, it gets around 80% of its theoretical peak, but if you apply it to double precision, it only gets around 40 GFLOPs on Linpack (out of a theoretical 64 DP GFLOPs). Even if you take NVIDIA at face value and say they get full theoretical peak (64 GFLOPs double precision) at 10 watts, that only gets you 6.4 GFLOPs/Watt. One thing that has been completely disregarded in this and my previous posts has been that the GFLOPs numbers we have been saying have been for Linpack and matrix-matrix (Level 3 BLAS) workloads, which are a very small number of real world applications... I would say on average Level 3 BLAS benchmarks get around 90% of theoretical peak on GPU systems, but as soon as you get into other application spaces (Level 1 and Level 2 BLAS, or anything dealing with a lot of memory movement) is where GPUs really start to fall, and only get ~10-20% of theoretical peak. Our architecture is built to actually be able to reach theoretical peak in a &quot;perfect&quot; (which in our case, our hand written FFT kernel), in all 3 BLAS levels. In reality, I would expect us to hit at least 85-90% theoretical peak in all of those floating point domains.<p>As for Altera and FPGAs... they are a royal PITA to program for, and will never be all that efficient. Altera&#x27;s 10 TFLOP/s number is ONLY capable of single precision float, and is based on adding up the theoretical capabilities of all the DSP slices... in reality, you would never be able to hit that with the memory limitations going to all the DSP slices. In small print, Altera even admits their 10 TFLOPs number is BS, as they list the highest FP32 number as 9.2 TFLOPs. Again, that theoretical 80 TFLOPs/Watt (which I would be surprised if it hits 50 in the real world) is only for single precision, in which we are aiming for 128. All the while we are a hell of a lot easier to program for.<p>As for short term competition, we know for a fact that Intel and NVIDIA will not be hitting our efficiency levels in this decade, and in addition we will have a cost advantage. Compared to FPGAs, we have the ability to actually port existing code over without huge performance sacrifices (C to gates or Altera&#x27;s OpenCL work is abysmal to performance) or change your development team/learn how to write RTL (You can write code for our chip in any language that LLVM has a frontend for).<p>As for market, our initial target market we are actively working on is large constellation FFT type workloads... think LTE-advanced and &quot;5G&quot; basestation processing as that&#x27;s where we have our best numbers (25x efficiency over the best DSPs in that space). Beyond that we are looking at the larger &quot;HPC&quot; category, and in the 5+ years out, I hope to be able to expand to more general purpose markets.",1439239694

They are manifested for example in phase transitions, where a quantum system becomes so sensitive to perturbations that a symmetry can be spontaneously broken. Here, we consider the possibility that the time evolution governing quantum dynamics may be similarly subject to an instability, at which its unitarity spontaneously breaks down owing to an extreme sensitivity towards perturbations. We find that indeed such an instability exists, and we explore its immediate consequences. Interpretations of the results both in terms of extreme sensitivity to the influence of environmental degrees of freedom, and in terms of a possible fundamental violation of unitarity are discussed.<p>---snip---<p>Is this suggesting that quantum superpositions have a tendency to spontaneously collapse, or am I misreading it?",1439237820

10036955,comment,10032903,10033863,0,0,beloch,,,"Western culture is obsessed with novelty and originality. In the West, one of the worst things you can say about an artist&#x27;s work is that it&#x27;s a mere reproduction of something that came before.  In Japanese culture, reproduction of classics is held in high esteem.  For this reason, the art of creating most of these weapons and using them is still very much alive.  Western martial arts and arms rapidly fell into obscurity and oblivion once firearms took over.<p>Timing may also be a factor.  Most western martial arts fell into obscurity and then oblivion centuries ago, while many of these obscure Japanese weapons were still in use well into the nineteenth and even twentieth centuries.  Even if Japanese martial techniques had not been valued and maintained, they still would have been in living memory when chambara flicks became popular.  For this reason, their portrayal in film has few rivals in Western cinema.<p>There were a few western martial arts that survived to modern times.  Boxing was one, and fencing was another.  Fencing certainly had it&#x27;s heyday, both on the Shakespeare dominated stage and in the golden age of Hollywood thanks to great fencer/actors like Basil Rathbone, but the style of fencing practised was only appropriate to a select few historical settings.  Fencing is descended from a duelling discipline and isn&#x27;t really appropriate in a battle setting or even a fight between commoners. Films where it is appropriate are made so infrequently that actors rarely study fencing at all, let alone enough to become masters.<p>This is probably why Hollywood embraced Hong Kong fight choreography so enthusiastically in the seventies. It allowed them to fill in the holes left by the death of most Western martial arts with something that was flashy and graceful.  Audiences hungry for more Eastern martial arts have naturally consumed a lot of films made in Hong Kong and Japan, and this probably fuelled their curiosity about Japanese weaponry.  The fact that Hollywood had to import fight choreography probably also gave many the notion that Eastern martial arts were superior to anything in the West, when the truth is that it was simply better maintained, thanks to cultural values and the relatively late dominance of firearms in the East.",1439237247

When firearms became more cost-effective than swords, the state of the art in blades was simply frozen and romanticized.<p>Practically anything you can make out of the right modern commodity steels (1060, 5160 spring, 9260 spring) is as good as or better than historically accurate reproductions using era-appropriate manufacturing.  If you take the leaf spring (5160 spring) from an old car and re-forge it into a sword, you can do better than a katana.  You simply have access to better metal.<p>And likewise, if you stamp out a few hundred identical pinky-sized stainless steel bits and used wire to make lamellar out of them, you&#x27;re probably going to be better armored than the best-equipped knight was before the gunpowder age.  And shinier.<p>Like most military technologies, swords were &quot;perfected&quot; only after they became obsolete.  As such, the best sword ever made is probably one that was made <i>this year</i>, as a movie prop or display piece, and it will never be used in actual combat.  But if you took it back in time to 1000 AD....",1439237194

This means that if you used programs enough you&#x27;d eventually pick up programming skills.<p>I&#x27;d like to make modern GUI stuff work a bit more like that. I&#x27;m imagining a state synchronized pseudo filesystem. Instead of storing files, it stores hierarchical C data types. A folder, with an array of vertexes and faces, inside another folder that contains textures and metadata. They&#x27;re not folders, just nodes, but hopefully you get the idea.<p>You can use your image editor to edit those textures, and the changes would show up in real time in your 3D scene editor. Small applications that do one thing well, because the &quot;file types&quot;(data structures) are standardized enough.<p>Programs subscribe to changes in a file, sometimes over a network, using a state synchronization protocol. Think rethinkDB, but optimized for very fast read/write, not querying data. If you wanted to query the data like that, you&#x27;d have a daemon watch the folder, and index the data. The point is to focus on speed above all else, so you can watch real movies or stream real content in it, and then build your indexing a layer above that.<p>Of course there are a whole lot of problems with that approach, and it&#x27;s well beyond me.

We have here a shining example of why Microsoft is becoming irrelevant.<p>You&#x27;re making the case that Windows ME sucked, Vista sucked, 7 was good, and 8 sucks.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely missing the bigger picture, which is this: nobody cares about operating systems anymore. Everyone, I think, finally gets that the function of the operating system is to get out of the way of the application that the user is running. iOS and Android are perfect examples of this. Everyone who argues about operating systems now talks about contextual menu this, flat button style that, driver update this, without realizing that the typical primary use of a computer these days-- desktop, laptop, tablet, whatever-- has nothing to do with the operating system and everything to do with HTML and JSON.<p>You talk about how a lot of people bought iPads thinking that it would fully replace their PC, and now they&#x27;re disappointed. I would argue that, based upon the rate at which mobile web traffic is increasing, those people are anything but disappointed.<p>I have serious doubts that there will be a Windows 9. There will simply be no market for it. No kid today is asking their parents for a Windows Phone or a Surface. None.

As in, not &quot;aww look how broken and pathetic I am to be all curled up in a ball like this&quot;, but rather, &quot;look at what a complex feat of engineering I am, and look how helpful it is of my body to warn me and signal me when I&#x27;m exposing it to stresses it doesn&#x27;t like very much.&quot;<p>So you might want to look up the terms &quot;cortisol surge&quot; and &quot;adrenal fatigue&quot;.  And also look into that magical chemical known as serotonin, and how it works as a cross-regulator among various cognitive and strictly physical subsystems in your body.  Mind you, I&#x27;ve had no formal medical training, I&#x27;m just saying a bit of self-study and serious research might be helpful here.<p>As to how to prevent them:  that&#x27;s a touch one, because everyone has different trigger thresholds, and (despite what big pharma would dearly like for you to believe) there are no magic bullets.<p>But personally I&#x27;ve found a sustained, low-key meditation practice to have surprisingly positive long-term benefits.  When you strip away the paranormal- and pseudoscientific baggage around it (which are really just that), what it comes down to is (1) basic common sense awareness of how mental and emotional stress works in the body, and in particular, how it correlates with physical stress; (2) how easily we fall into &quot;monkey-mind&quot; patterns of reacting to stressful situations, rather than simply detaching from and (mentally) walking away from them, as it were; and (3) how the same natural tendency of our minds/bodies to learn counterproductive reactive behaviors, can, over time, be used to &quot;unlearn&quot; them, and with surprising efficacy.<p>But in general -- increased awareness of how our minds and bodies aren&#x27;t really separate things, but different manifestations / aspects of the same, unified (and beautiful) thing; couple with a realization of how much potential we really have (despite all of our past mistakes, and all the crummy things other people do to us, or say about us), can really help quite a lot.",1374267371

And from my own experience(YMMV) driving 90-100mph makes you very aware of road waaaay ahead of you, a thought of looking anywhere else(phone, radio) but the road does not even cross my mind,because of how fast I am going and how much more intense of an experience that is.

Blacks marrying whites impacts the sanctity of traditional marriage and will harm children&quot; and on and on and on.<p>There is almost no argument that marriage equality opponents use that wasn&#x27;t also used against that back then.

We&#x27;re all adults here.

They simply are not a 21st century software company anymore. The marketplace perception of Microsoft now is that they are a dinosaur that also makes a gaming console. Period.<p>They may very well have a functional competitor to EC2, but I cannot think of one serious company that is choosing Azure over AWS, or Rackspace, or even Digital Ocean or Heroku. The Azure Case Studies page is an absolute joke, a mockery of what you would expect from a behemoth as Microsoft. The simple fact is that Amazon completely owns the market that Microsoft is trying to break into. (This is especially funny given the years 1992-1996)<p>They may very well have a functional competitor to Google Docs/Drive/Apps/whatever it&#x27;s called now, but again, Google is totally dominating that market (crappy updates to Gmail aside). Microsoft is stuck on the outside looking in, and anyone who is starting a company, given the choice between Office 365 and Google Apps, they aren&#x27;t picking Office anymore.<p>Windows Phone is a joke and I&#x27;m not going to devote any more words to it.<p>Windows 8 isn&#x27;t even worth any discussion.<p>The reality is, is that as kids in college today enter the workforce with their Android or iPhone, and Gmail/Gdrive, and knowledge of AWS, the <i>need</i> for Microsoft (which you have to admit, MS has been coasting on for probably 15-20 years now) is evaporating.

They were relatively well known crime writers (rather than literary critics which is where you might smell a rat) but not people you&#x27;d know if you weren&#x27;t in to crime fiction.<p>The level of reviewing she got is pretty much what you&#x27;d expect from a book published by a major publisher in hardback. Yes they put their weight behind it but they&#x27;d do that in all similar cases - by the time they&#x27;ve paid for a manuscript to be edited and published as a hardback they&#x27;re going to do everything they can to get that book in front of people as they&#x27;ve made a significant investment.<p>You might even argue in this case that they&#x27;d be more likely to go easy - after all there is essentially no risk to them. If it fails all they have to do is leak that it&#x27;s her and it&#x27;ll shift a load so there really is no reason to go against what were presumably Rowling&#x27;s wishes (particularly as she&#x27;s known to be strong willed and not someone you&#x27;d want to piss off if you want to publish her again).<p>What sort of makes your point is that she was being published in hard back at all - a major achievement for a first time writer and if she weren&#x27;t who she were handing that manuscript in she may not have been published at all, but if you make the comparison between this and any other crime hardback, there&#x27;s no evidence they did anything special.<p>The same is true of the sales.<p>The article makes out that 1,500 copies was a failure. Had it been a JK Rowling book that would certainly be true, but for a couple of months sales of a hardback from an unknown crime writer. Typically a debut novel will sell a few thousand copies in hardback and given that it hadn&#x27;t been out that long (a couple of months against a total hardback sales period of maybe a year) isn&#x27;t unreasonable to think this might have hit a pretty solid level. To put it in context the first Harry Potter novel had a first print run of 500 in hardback.<p>TL;DR version: the research may be fine but there&#x27;s little evidence tying what happened with Rowling to it&#x27;s point.",1374266623

One of the goals of courts is to streamline the law so that cases that don&#x27;t have merit can be dismissed quickly and easily. If you follow litigations in the popular press, you&#x27;ll see that a lot of lawsuits get dismissed on &quot;technicalities&quot; (i.e. procedural rules). E.g. the EFF&#x27;s NSA litigation is in danger of getting dismissed for a lack of standing (i.e. dismissal because the plaintiff can&#x27;t show actual injury). Courts create these procedural barriers because getting to the merits (i.e. looking at the facts) of litigation is time-consuming and expensive. Courts also create other barriers. For example, in a shareholder suit, there is something called the business judgment rule: i.e. in the absence of a conflict of interest or something like that, a court will defer to management&#x27;s superior business judgment. Rules like that allow shareholder suits to be evaluated and dismissed based on facts that are easy to prove without having to reach facts that are expensive to investigate and prove.<p>In patent litigation, there is precious little of that. Patent litigations very quickly become a very fact-intensive process of interpreting a complex and voluminous patent, getting expert witness testimony about exactly how the defendants product works, etc. Once a lawyer is sitting down with an engineer looking over code, the clock really gets going.<p>The Supreme Court has been very reluctant to create categorical rules in terms of patentability, and that&#x27;s largely because the Patent Act is written in a way that makes such categorical rules inconsistent with the intent of the law. But the fact is that categorical rules (e.g. no software patents, deference to business judgment) make litigation cheaper, and that&#x27;s an important consideration too.",1374266059

That&#x27;s not just a difference, but a complete opposite.<p>Not really one relevant to much of the legality around marriage. About the only thing it even remotely connects to is the presumption of paternity (the default assignment of <i>legal</i> parental responsibility to the spouse of the biological mother of any child born during the marriage.) And, even then, its not really a problem. There are two different forms of the presumption, and which is adopted varies by jursidiction.<p>Rebuttable: In this model, the concept of rights and responsibility of biological parents as preeminent is maintained, but the spouse is presumptively assigned parental rights and responsibility, but this can be reversed if there is evidence that the spouse is not the parent. Obviously, in the case of same sex marriage, this is resolved simply, as the evidence is readily available to rebut the presumption in all cases.<p>Conclusive: This model is based on the priority of the marital relationship over biological parenthood for raising children, and in jurisdictions adopting this this model the spouse of the biological mother is <i>conclusively</i> assigned parental rights and responsibility with regard to any children born during the marriage. Obviously, there works just fine in same-sex marriage.<p>So, the same-sex-couples cannot reproduce with their spouse thing is a difference, but not one which seems especially problematic with regard to the legalities around marraige.<p>> The reason I&#x27;m against gay marriage is that I don&#x27;t want the definition to change<p>That&#x27;s not much of a reason.<p>Why do you think the current definition of marriage, the result of continuous change over an extended period of time, is so perfect that it should not continue to change?<p>> and I don&#x27;t want my children having gay propaganda pushed on them.<p>What does that have to do with equal marriage one way or the other?

That&#x27;s not just a difference, but a complete opposite.<p>You&#x27;re just stating explicitly the implicit argument I was refuting, but ok:<p>The difference is immaterial for our purposes. The fact that one or both parents in a family do not have a biological link to their children is irrelevant. It&#x27;s a curiosity of genetics that has little-to-nothing to do with how a family functions on a social level, which is the level marriage laws operate on.<p>Are we banning adoptions and step-children now? Society has no reason to outlaw couples that can&#x27;t reproduce together. Homosexuals can adopt, they can use surrogates, they can have children from previous marriages (ended in divorce, or death, etc). As long as we&#x27;re think-of-the-children-ing it would be better all around to let those children grow up in families if possible.<p>More importantly, that&#x27;s not a difference between heterosexual and homosexual couples - it&#x27;s a difference between <i>couples</i>. Many straight people can not or will not reproduce with their spouse either - are we going to ban marriages between infertile people? Force people to have children?<p>The point is this: if you pick at random a married gay couple...and then pick at random a married straight couple....the difference between them will be no greater than the difference that we already tolerate between heterosexual couples. Therefore, you cannot argue that we must ban gay marriage on the basis of preventing some problematic aspect of gay marriage - any &quot;problem&quot; gay marriage is one heterosexual marriage also has. It&#x27;s a largely artificial distinction. If not being able to have children together is SUCH a big deal, then argue against that and let gay couples be banned under that banner.<p>If you&#x27;re going to ban it on the basis that a gay couple is statistically much more likely to have quality X, then quality X must be a VERY serious thing. Infertility is not serious enough to qualify.<p>Note too this situation may change. The science of reproduction is ever evolving and changing.<p>>  These are good reasons in my opinion.<p>> is that I don&#x27;t want the definition to change<p>This is either silly and arbitrary, or begging the question.<p>You don&#x27;t want it to change why?

You&#x27;re not sure, but it grabs your attention. Next, your hands and feet are sweaty and start shaking. This is usually the feeling that overcomes you before getting sick, but you&#x27;ve never had the urge to take off your clothes like you do now. It&#x27;s hot and they&#x27;re keeping you from breathing, holding you down, and constricting you. Your mouth has never filled with saliva this way before. That tingling in your feet and hands have never spread up your body and to your spine. You can&#x27;t swallow. It&#x27;s in your head now. Static starts to take over your vision and hearing, tunneling your perception and fixing it to a point. The only thing that matters now is staying awake. No one is here to help you, so you have to stay awake. Don&#x27;t close your eyes. It feels like you&#x27;re being torn away from your consciousness. Each second multiplies the force that is pulling your mind into this chasm of fear. At this point you are certain that you are dying. Your thoughts fill with worries and regrets, and then pleading and begging. These thoughts only help confirm that something is wrong.<p>The doctor told me I had a panic attack. I was hoping for something a bit more concrete - something that could be fixed. Not a diagnosis that  the knowledge of, worsens that very condition. Now I have this worry that it could happen again at any moment, and like before, I&#x27;ll be by myself when it hits.<p>Have any of you experienced anything like this before? Did you go to the doctor? Has it happened more than once? Have you felt one coming on, then successfully prevented it?

Of course there is some influence from the critics towards the general public (and vice versa, although less I guess) but not enough, hence the critically praised novels that still fail to sell widely.",1374264732

There are many reasons to my answer, here are some:<p>The problem with a US based LLC is that you open up free access to thousands of patent trolls waiting to eat your hard earned money. This isn&#x27;t a problem if you can afford a decent Lawyer for $5000-15000, but for businesses like mine, which are bootstrapped, it&#x27;s totally unaffordable.<p>Well funded startups usually have a separate legal department to resolve these issues, but when you&#x27;re running \na startup totally from your own pocket, it becomes extremely hard and annoying. I was wondering for a solution until a very good friend of mine suggested me something nice.<p>If you set up a company somewhere in India (or some other popular, Start-up friendly developing country), these patent trolls have little access to you in terms of licensing, etc. Usually a patent troll will send you a legal letter threatening you about violation of some kind of absurd technology patent, etc. But, when you start up elsewhere, these become nulled[1]. Meaning, they can&#x27;t touch you. Worse-case scenario, even if someone DID sue you, the lawyers are really cheap in such developing countries. We&#x27;re talking about price ranges of $50-1000. And for $500 bucks you can get some really nice lawyers to get the job done.<p>There&#x27;s also a LOT of start-up friendly exemptions for companies in such developing countries simply because they don&#x27;t have enough of them and they want more people to start up.<p>So, even though these countries are often referred to as &#x27;third worlds&#x27;, they are really good places to start up. If you know of anyone wanting to start up from those countries, you should probably team up with them as their co-founder and that should be good enough.<p>Of course, all this assuming that you aren&#x27;t interested in seeking funding and you want a bootstrapped start up. But then, if you are seeking funding, you&#x27;ll probably have enough cash to afford a $5000 lawyer anyway.<p>One potential issue you may find running a startup from a developing country is the access to decent payment gateways. But then, if you don&#x27;t mind sharing an extra 1% with the gateway provider, you can probably use someone like skrill.",1374264560

Then the big leap of symbolic faith[1] is subtracting a big number from a smaller one to get negative numbers. After this there&#x27;s the idea of counting repeated additions and giving that a shortcut, resulting in multiplication, and the reveral of that gives division. The big mental jump then is dividing a small number by a bigger number, giving fractions.<p>[1] You have to remember that mathematics is basically formalising our limited number intuition into language, so we can manipulate the symbols as we would manipulate real world objects, greatly increasing our capacity to reason about these ideas. &quot;Doing with Images makes Symbols,&quot; to quote Alan Kay.",1374264439

Outsource it (and I&#x27;ll note that the largest reseller of Exchange, Intermedia, doesn&#x27;t sell Office365).<p>The first windows phone I had was Windows Mobile 4.0. The flipphone handsets that came out during 6.0 were good, but every one of their gigantic, flagship, Halo devices, was terrible. HTC had some of the most badass, feature-packed phones ever, and the Operating system killed them. It&#x27;s just a pile of bloat, the same way WinPhone7 and WinPhone8 appear to be. Look at the work they&#x27;ve done with Nokia where they basically paid Nokia billions of dollars in marketing money to attempt to promote WinPho8 and ended up hemmoraging marketshare in the transition from Symbian (Elop&#x27;s &quot;Burning Platform&quot; memo should go down as the worst corporate writing ever, and it&#x27;s not lost on me that he came from $MSFT).<p>I won&#x27;t even dignify the surface with commentary. It was an unmitigated disaster that everyone saw coming.<p>Azure is only large because of promo usage. It&#x27;s not competitive even with Digital Ocean in terms of scale (my personal opinion, I have no facts to back this up except anecdotes I can&#x27;t publish). There&#x27;s a lot of empty instances in Azure land.<p>Microsoft is making a lot of obvious errors. They continue to be unable to remove FUD and the Cruft of age. If they go down this path, the inertia will eventually kill them; it might take 20 years, but Microsoft is already becoming a place that finds it hard to recruit. I would argue that without their ridiculous abuse of the H1B program they would not be able to remain competitive.<p>In short, there&#x27;s a lot of stuff to fix. The bright spot for Microsoft, as always, is licensing, but that&#x27;s an ugly, ugly business.<p>My $.02.",1374264260

My issue with them is that they may well be a self-fulfilling prophecy if I don&#x27;t know what the lower numerical bound for &quot;Frequently&quot; is, be it a number, a percentage, etc. Theoretically, you could use an otherwise statistically unacceptable number of bought togethers to &quot;seed&quot; the frequently bought together criteria, and from then on it simply gets reinforced by subsequent buyers who take that recommendation at face value.\nThe reason this is an &quot;itch&quot; for me is that I have a long wish list on Amazon, using Amazon as I do as a bookmark of sorts for books I want to buy at some undefined point in the future. I&#x27;d want to trust the FBT thing enough to add the other books, other than the one I wanted, to o wish list as well without having to read their profiles, reader reviews and so on.

5983016,comment,5982313,5982313,44,0,beloch,,,"Unfortunately, this article includes pretty much everything <i>but</i> how the NSA taps fiber at the bottom of the ocean.  I&#x27;m actually a bit curious about this myself...<p>If you want to tap a classical signal traveling down a fiber, you want to turn that fiber into a beam splitter. A beam splitter probabilistically reroutes photons from the data stream down a different fiber.  Since a single bit traveling down a fiber optic cable is represented by millions of photons in an identical optical state and fiber-optic lines are lossy, a few won&#x27;t be missed. A 99/1 splitter (i.e. 99% one way, 1% the other) would be pretty hard to detect in a fiber optic line that is subject to fluctuating loss caused by bending, temperature change, etc..<p>The trick, according to this article, is to avoid cutting the fiber and splicing in a beam splitter.  This is because, immediately after the fiber goes dark, the company running it will want to know where the fault is and hook up an OTDR to the line.  In the simplest terms possible, this is a device that sends light down the fiber and looks at what gets reflected back.  Any break in the fiber will reflect light back the way it came. Time how long the round-trip takes and you can pinpoint where the break is and send out a repair crew.  If the operators are fast this can take mere seconds to do. Naturally, the NSA doesn&#x27;t want repair crews finding their tap-in points!<p>So how do you turn a piece of fiber into a beam-splitter without cutting and splicing?  Well, that&#x27;s surprisingly easy.  One way to create a fiber beam splitter is to take two fibers and fusion-combine them.  Basically, you put them right next to each other and heat them up so that they melt together just a little bit.  If you did this to a line in service it would never have to be cut.  This is dead easy to do... to one fiber...  in a lab.  Doing it to a bundle of fibers in the deep sea is challenging!  However, it&#x27;s certainly feasible.  Given that the NSA&#x27;s budget dwarfs the entire scientific research budget of many nations, it&#x27;s reasonable to expect they could get pretty good at it given a couple of decades.<p>They probably aren&#x27;t doing this.  I&#x27;ve done a little in free-space optics, but fiber really isn&#x27;t in my bailiwick.  There are probably other, much easier ways.  However, based on a few minutes of thought I&#x27;m convinced the claims of the article are beyond merely feasible.  I&#x27;d be shocked if the NSA, and <i>every</i> other nation out there with subs, doesn&#x27;t have the same capability.<p>The real trick, of course, is getting the data back home (and processing it).  The article suggests that the Jimmy Carter has the ability to lay fiber lines, presumably to take their purloined bits back to the nearest NSA processing center. The amplifiers spoken of are unlikely to be used to boost the signal that continues on the original fiber back to the people being spied upon, simply because a good method of tapping in should be indistinguishable from fiber loss, plus components like amplifiers spliced into the line are detectable!  No, those amplifiers are likely there to boost the signal going down the NSA&#x27;s pirate lines.  What I don&#x27;t understand is how the NSA keeps their lines from being detected.  Wouldn&#x27;t, for example, Russia patrol it&#x27;s fiber back-bones (while tapping other nations fiber) and cut the NSA&#x27;s lines?  There may very well be an underwater struggle going on day-to-day that we&#x27;re entirely unaware of!",1372837258

No, parts of your brain seamlessly and automatically do all that work for you, even though sometimes it can be complex work requiring your higher cognitive abilities.

This isn&#x27;t about entitlement or whether services are free or paid, or even about Google reader specifically, and it&#x27;s certainly not related to entitled users on HN.<p>From the article:\n<i>That world formed the webs foundations  without that world to build on, Google, Facebook, and Twitter couldnt exist. But theyve now grown so large that everything from that web-native world is now a threat to them, and they want to shut it down. Sunset it. Clean it up. Retire it. Get it out of the way so they can get even bigger and build even bigger proprietary barriers to anyone trying to claim their territory.</i><p>He&#x27;s talking about whether we should accept the ongoing corralling of the web into walled gardens where there is one gatekeeper and landowner, and everyone else producing goods for the public is a sharecropper, and the public can only buy what&#x27;s on offer - take it or leave it. There&#x27;s a real danger in building or living inside the walls of these corporate communities (twitter, Facebook, Google+, whatever Apple&#x27;s equivalent to eWorld is called these days). The tension between large corporations and their users (free or not) is of course as old as the hills, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we should give in to their latest attempts to lock users into one ecosystem that they control.<p>This instinct is why Apple prevents Amazon from selling on its iOS platform, why Amazon wants to be the world marketplace for everything, why Facebook encourages people to put their online lives exclusively behind a FB login, and why Google wants to channel everything through G+ and require an account for any activity on the web. It&#x27;s a natural instinct for corporations, but not one we should accept or buy into.<p>There is something to your last statement, in that this behaviour seems to be tied to the size of a corporation - once it grows to a certain size, priorities inevitably change, the staff changes, and the drive to seek rent from customers and partners becomes overwhelming. So in a sense this is a natural cycle that it&#x27;s difficult or impossible for companies to avoid. That doesn&#x27;t meant that we as customers and developers should acquiesce to the brave new world, and start building our products or lives around services like reader - as many have found out this week, that&#x27;s a bad strategy, because large corporations don&#x27;t really care about the service, or the value to users, all they care about is the lock-in.<p>That means we can happily use these services, but should always remember they may be withdrawn by fiat, and never build a business on them - for example if you build your company dependent on a twitter, FB or G+ login, don&#x27;t be surprised in a few years when they start to charge for the privilege of growing on their land.

If they had, I suspect the vast majority of users - including API users - would have gladly paid for it. Rather, they pulled the plug completely, and the only reason they did that was because they simply did not give a shit. It was an utterly disrespectful thing to do to users who came to rely on the service.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that Reader crushed most of its competition after it came out[1]. It was like a Walmart that opened smack in the middle of a town - none of the smaller shops could compete with it and they closed. In the case of Reader, this was okay with most people, since it was free at the time. But then Google said, &quot;welp, this isn&#x27;t making us any money&quot; and shut it down. Too bad the noteworthy competitors were long gone by then. That&#x27;s the absurdity of this whole thing.<p>To go back to the Walmart example, it&#x27;s like a Walmart that comes into town, forces the smaller shops to close, and then leaves town a few years later. Where will the townspeople do their shopping now?<p>I know it isn&#x27;t a perfect analogy, but I think it is accurate enough to get the point across: <i>if you come out with a free service and end up displacing everyone else in the market, then you have an ethical responsibility to at least try to continue the service in some shape or form.</i> Start charging for it and explain why you are doing it. Some may complain but most will understand and agree to pay since they have come to appreciate it and rely on it. Or serve ads, somehow. But whatever you do, don&#x27;t just shut it down citing lack of profits.

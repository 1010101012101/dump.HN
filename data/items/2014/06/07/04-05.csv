7861326,comment,7859788,7859788,2,0,doobiaus,,,"I&#x27;ve been with C# since the beginning, 1.1, coming from ASP &#x27;classic&#x27;, I absolutely love C# as a language. But... I&#x27;m now working in a Ruby/Linux shop handling some of their legacy app integration and I&#x27;ve come to understand that a lot of the disinterest comes from a complete clash of culture more than anything else. By that I don&#x27;t mean the old &quot;Evil M$&quot; rubbish - for 10 years Microsoft has not understood Open Source culture. Instead of collaborate it was compete compete compete. NHibernate vs Entity Framework, ASP.NET MVC vs fubu/castle, Codeplex instead of GitHub, everything was done to keep people dependent on Microsoft.<p>ALT.NET came and went, but there was never a really strong open source community. That combined with the cross sell policy is a barrier to entry. Everything has been tightly coupled, IIS dependencies in ASP.NET makes Mono a second class citizen, MSSQL dependencies in EF made code first migrations break in MySQL. All designed to sell licenses, books and certification.<p>Talking about productions web apps, at the end of the day it has to be on Windows, even if you want to dev on Mono. If I&#x27;m going to start building a production app you start asking yourself questions about licensing costs too, Server, SQL, VS pro, CALs. Okay so you can get it going for free if you join BizSpark, but then there&#x27;s the waiting etc etc and the niggling fact that eventually you will have to pay. Comparing that to my experience working on Linux is like chalk and cheese. vagrant up -> npm install -> {do work} -> git push heroku master. Frictionless, all for free, with no gatekeepers.<p>With OSS, people don&#x27;t sit around waiting for the mothership to fix issues, because there isn&#x27;t one, they band together and fix it themselves. Additionally, as I&#x27;ve come to realize (flamebait warning) Linux kills Windows on the server. Not by a nose, but like a Red Wedding in ease of use, footprint and resource utilization.<p>You also have to look at the &quot;why C#&quot; specifically. To do RAD web development it is much faster to use something like Rails. C# is more performant? Then use Java or node.js. C# just doesn&#x27;t fill a particular gap.<p>Having said that, it&#x27;s not all doom and goom, I think C# is the #1 choice for mobile development. I think the ASP.NET Titanic is starting to turn. Scott Guthrie seems to get it. The announcements recently with regards to ASP.NET vNext are all heading in the right direction and address a lot of the glaring issues. There is also some great non-MS .NET work being done at places like GitHub and StackExchange. Will it be enough to convince OSS types to start adopting it? I doubt it.",1402117011

White trousers which came half-way up \n   his ankles and a white shirt which was very \n   creased and crumpled. But it was a lovely sunny \n   day and Alan was in a cheerful mood and off \n   we went.\n\n  &quot;Then he thought it would be a good idea to go \n   to the Pleasure Beach at Blackpool. We found a \n   fortune-teller&#x27;s tent and Alan said he&#x27;d like \n   to go in so we waited around for him to come \n   back.\n\n  &quot;And this sunny, cheerful visage had shrunk into \n   a pale, shaking, horror-stricken face. \n   Something had happened. We don&#x27;t know what the \n   fortune-teller said but he obviously was deeply \n   unhappy. I think that was probably the last time \n   we saw him before we heard of his suicide.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nGee, <i>that&#x27;s</i> strange...<p><pre><code>  The inquest decided that Turing had killed himself \n  using cyanide. A partially eaten apple was by his \n  side in bed but as it was never tested it&#x27;s \n  impossible to say if it was laced with poison as \n  has been suggested.\n</code></pre>\nOh really?<p><pre><code>  An alternative interpretation is that he inhaled \n  or ingested cyanide by accident during a chemistry \n  experiment.\n</code></pre>\nSo your telling me... That someone with an analytical mind like Turing&#x27;s... just <i>decided</i> to go waste some money on a fortune teller (because it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re bullshit artists or anything)... while on a sudden, random trip to the sea shore...<p>And then, he emerges with his mood so visibly shattered, that a young girl never forgets the drastic, unexpected shift in personality, not even decades later does she forget this transient event. A short time later, he&#x27;s dead. And it&#x27;s a suspicious suicide.<p>Someone involved in developing machines to attack german Nazi military ciphers, with years of experience conducting efforts under secrecy with high-level government security clearance, while cities across the channel are being annihilated with firebombing, and futuristic ballistic missiles are falling from the sky.<p>This man tells a little girl he&#x27;s going to indulge in a superstitious visit with a &quot;<i>fortune teller</i>&quot;, and the liason blanches him white with fear.<p>That was no fortune teller. He was meeting with some shadowy figure involved in who-knows-what, and was either directly threatened by that person (because of some old-fashioned indignant opinions about his personal life and the respectable nature of his choices, and how they reflect upon his peers) and told that he had crossed an unforgivable line with his indiscretions...<p>...or he was told some truly disturbing news, maybe along the lines that a leak or a mole was discovered, and that his identity and level of participation in the war effort was now known by dangerous enemies, and his personal safety was very seriously compromised.<p>In my opinion, the involvement of cyanide seems to favor a professional murder, not a suicide, not mental illness, not bipolar mood swings induced by horomones, not a hobbyist&#x27;s science experiment gone awry.<p>I feel that it&#x27;s entirely possible, given the realm of secrecy and paranoia that Turing operated within earlier in life, that everyone relaxed just a little too much after the war ended, and some bitter post-war animosity had not fully evaporated, and someone knew him or found out about him, blamed him for their wartime misfortunes, and went after him.",1402116590

All these times nothing was really wrong with the code but I was at the mercy of commercial firms in finding compatible versions, getting licenses and having just basic long term support.  Most other solutions were either expensive or lock-in to a platform, and from experience no better guarantee of longevity of the platform.<p>So I went open source - with a LAMP stack - if I want to run old versions there&#x27;s no problem, maybe with hardware - but that also isn&#x27;t as big a factor.  No worries on selecting client compatibility as it is web based (have had to tweak based on HTML/Browser revisions, but nothing that really broke beyond fixing).  Every component was free (enough) for what I was doing, and it pretty much just worked.  I feel I had wisely steered clear of Filemaker Pro, Access, Cloudbase, Panorama, Visual Basic, or any other platform where I had to plug in a key and/or ask permission in order to install/use it.  I was happy, staff was happy... and still are.  Never looked back since.<p>.Net and other MS technology just reminds me of the struggles of the past added with new licensing schemes and more intricate lock-in.  So I prefer to ignore it.

They all searched directions to/from: Sutter/Stockton, 20th/Valencia, a block from Market/Church, and 4th/Howard - all of those being non-trivial streets in one form or another (<i>especially</i> Market St, really, you&#x27;re asking me for directions to Market St, that&#x27;s like asking me where the Strip is in Vegas). Not to mention I&#x27;m not sure why they keep asking for directions too, since it&#x27;s not like a cab I&#x27;ll never see again overcharging me through my own fault - if I have a problem I will contact Uber and they will fix it (also a good thing!). One guy even asked for instructions, disregarded them, got stuck in traffic without ending the ride early, and made me and my husband late for an appointment that we would have been 5-10m early for if he didn&#x27;t space out - helloooo 1 star rating. Oh, and half the time, I will get drivers with so much cologne on that I feel sick.<p>Say what you will about the terrible state of cabs in SF because it&#x27;s all true and then some, but I think both cabs and Uber have a lot of _different_ problems to work out. A 5 star driver is not someone who has to enter in &quot;Market and Church&quot; in a GPS, it&#x27;s not someone that poured half a bottle of cologne on themselves that morning, and it&#x27;s most definitely not a person that fucks around driving in the direction they were explicitly told not to go in.<p>Some days I am jealous of NYC and London and other cities where I&#x27;ve had excellent experiences with cabs and Uber just adds a small layer of luxury/convenience on top of that if I choose.

I&#x27;m not a statistics expert by any means, but this is one of the first things taught in an intro stats class: observational studies can establish relationships (correlation), but only well designed experiments can establish causation. This is quite obviously an observational study, and a tiny one at that.<p>Furthermore, wouldn&#x27;t the fact that marijuana was legalized in Washington violate the parallel trend assumption that has to hold to use difference in differences when comparing with San Francisco?<p>I understand the powerful incentive for Uber to provide this narrative, and I think anything that encourages people to not drive while intoxicated is a good thing.

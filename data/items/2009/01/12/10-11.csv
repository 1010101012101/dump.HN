And then they should work to get the best situation possible for their people. Instead they are trying to keep their cause alive, and who cares about the casualties. They lost and everyone knows it - but they refuse to allow themself to admit it, and so they kill their own people.<p><i>Sad that humanity is still entralled to degenerate tribalism at the dawn of the 21st century</i><p>What makes you think the 21st century is anything special? Humans haven't changed in the slightest since those ""delusional Bronze and Iron age cult leaders"". (That comment doesn't even make any sense since the bronze age was before, or at the very edge of, recorded history, but whatever.)<p>I checked some of your other comments, and they seemed normal - this one isn't.

There are very valuable discussions on Reddit if you ignore the obvious trolls and jokes.<p>I found Reddit's programming significantly more technical than HN, with most people talking from experience instead of guessing. Compare recent discussions on the same technical story on HN vs. Reddit.<p>Also HN gets to me because it harder to find reasonable arguments with completely opposed views without massive up/down-votes [by the masses backing their side]. Reddit [discussions] [often have] opposed but very insightful comments together and both [have] hundreds of up-votes.<p>The traditional HN bashing of other sites lowers the discussion and actually it's very typical of, er, Digg/Reddit (pun.)",1231756278

I always click links to Wikipedia, New Yorker, Wired, and many other good sources (from experience.)<p>Perhaps a feature could be a Agree/disagree vote for stories to distinguish from up-voting the HN discussion.",1231755795

Intercellular enzymes might operate with the precision of programs, but they float in a forgiving, scalable goo. I want that goo in my software.<p>The most advanced programs we have now are about the equivalent of unicellular organisms. It will be some time before we figure out how to make systems with ""life"" and resilience.<p>Kay also mentions funding, which seems to be a cherished topic on this forum: ""[ARPA]'s like the goose that laid the golden eggs. When you start forcing the process, it kills it. ARPA succeeded because they basically funded people instead of projects. They didn't really care what the people were doing. They figured neat people would do neat things... And, boy, it's really hard to find any funding like that nowadays. """,1231755245

But then what disqualifies this kid's bids as not being part of determining the true cost? He says that he accepted possibly going to jail, and I'm sure he'd rather be in debt for the bid amount instead of jail, so in essence his bids <i>were</i> backed up by a commitment.<p>You know, now that he's got a bit of money and publicity backing him, it'd be kind of funny if he sued and got all of the sales that were completed <i>after</i> he was escorted out invalidated, as he was denied participation, and therefore they are _undervalued_.",1231754975

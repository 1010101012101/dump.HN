7127731,comment,7126754,7126754,9,0,tzs,,,"When I read the headline, and the comments here before reading the article, I was expecting to see tracking data that went from the seller to the buyer with a mysterious stop near the NSA.<p>Then I read the article. The tacking data shows a <i>delivery</i> to a destination near the NSA.<p>Does anyone here seriously think that the mechanism the NSA uses if they want to tamper with a laptop on the way to simply change the <i>destination</i> address to be the NSA? And that no one has noticed this before?<p>If they are intercepting and modifying domestic shipments, the mechanism would be something that is executed AT the shipping carrier facilities or possibly during the final delivery, and would be completely transparent to outside observers, including both the sender and the receiver of the package.<p>Watch the &quot;Modern Marvels&quot; episode on package delivery for a look at how the automated package movement systems work at the major hubs, and you&#x27;ll see how a package could be diverted for special treatment and then re-inserted into the system transparently, with most workers at the facility having no idea something special is going on.<p>The best chance at detecting this from outside would probably be to look at next day delivery orders on items that would be the most time consuming to modify, to see if those are more likely to miss their delivery deadline. The idea is that with such a tight schedule, the chances are higher than an interception will blow the delivery schedule. For items ordered with two day or longer shipment, the delay in modifying the item could be made up by upgrading it to one day delivery in the system when it is re-inserted. That&#x27;s why observing one day delivery items is the best bet.",1390780704

7127725,comment,7126050,7127578,5,0,RivieraKid,,,"> I sincerely believe (as a computational scientist) that a combination of a high-level language for real-time interactive exploration and prototyping with a fast language like C for doing the actual gruntwork, is the best.<p>Converting to C can take a LOT of time, and is an order of magnitude less enjoyable than Julia. What about maintaining the code, making improvements, integrating with other code? And what if the prototyping needs too be fast too? It can become a massive pain in the ass. Why should I undergo that if I can just use Julia?<p>> Attempts to combine the best of C (speed) with the best of scripting languages (easy to do things fast without having to pay attention to what you are doing) in my opinion end up merely joining the worst of both worlds rather than the best of both worlds.<p>I&#x27;ve used both Julia and C and I think it&#x27;s the exact opposite, it combines the best of both worlds.",1390780634

7127721,comment,7126754,7127514,4,0,mikeash,,,"Yes, we are all just guessing.<p>And I think you misunderstand. I am not arguing that it &quot;could not be&quot; the NSA. And I haven&#x27;t see anyone say that. I am simply arguing that it is extremely unlikely.<p>It&#x27;s a guess, yes, but it&#x27;s an informed guess. It&#x27;s a matter of looking at probabilities and seeing what&#x27;s more likely. Shippers screw up all the time. Packages make crazy detours because somebody tossed a box in the wrong truck. A label falls off and a mixup occurs. Somebody typos a tracking number.<p>On the other hand, for this to be the NSA, several unlikely things would have to be true:<p>1. The NSA would need to be intercepting computer equipment destined for certain people and modifying it to spy on them.<p>2. The NSA would need to be targeting the person in question for this program.<p>3. The NSA would need to have set up this program in such a boneheaded way that it shows up on a package tracker. (If I were in charge of this program, I&#x27;d just set it up in FedEx&#x27;s sorting facility in Memphis and then ensure all the relevant equipment uses FedEx. Simple, fast, and no chance of the target finding out.)<p>4. The NSA would need to have set up this program in Alexandria, even though it has little to recommend it for such a thing.<p>Now, we know that #1 is actually true. So that&#x27;s one requirement fulfilled, out of several. But what about the rest?<p>I&#x27;m somewhat skeptical on #2. It&#x27;s possible, but it seems unlikely. Why would the NSA target Tor developers? The security of Tor falls apart in the presence of an adversary that is able to monitor the entire internet, because you can just correlate traffic that enters with traffic that exits. The NSA can presumably monitor enough of the internet to defeat Tor right now. So why bother spying on Tor developers? It&#x27;s <i>possible</i> as a belt-and-suspenders maneuver, but this person just doesn&#x27;t strike me as a likely target.<p>I&#x27;m <i>really</i> skeptical on #3. It&#x27;s about as believable as having the FBI spy on me by parking a van outside my house that says &quot;Flowers By Irene&quot;. It&#x27;s possible, but really unlikely.<p>And #4 doesn&#x27;t make a whole lot of sense to me. Again, possible, but unlikely.<p>So we have one thing that&#x27;s true, and then several other things that are individually unlikely, and combine to be really unlikely. It looks to me that people are committing the basic fallacy of thinking that the truth of #1, since it&#x27;s unlikely, somehow makes the rest more likely too.<p>It comes down to this: is it a screwup by USPS or Amazon or a third-party reseller, or is it the NSA screwing up royally while trying to plant a bug? In the absence of evidence, we are stuck guessing, but we can guess <i>intelligently</i> by realizing that one is vastly more likely than the others.<p>&quot;When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras.&quot;<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean zebras are impossible. But it means you should prefer the more obvious explanation unless there&#x27;s evidence to the contrary.",1390780591

7127715,comment,7126605,7127435,1,0,001sky,,,"This is quite similar to my comment in the last sentence.<p>But more importantly, the broad counterfactual that before WWII, broadly speaking, people were more married and less wealthy.<p>Furthermore its highly plausible that (so-called) breakdown of marriage (in the post-war) is correlated with non-wealth effects, such as the sexual revolution fostered by hormonal birth control and the spread/use of class A drugs (ie: culture, technology). So, in addition to wealth not explaining marriage rates (broadly) at the scale of long- time, in the short term it has competition as an explanatory variable in the micro-analytic sense. Thirdly, and importantly, the relationship of marriage as a utilitarian tool for <gaining> wealth is an altogether diferent layer of abstraction. It may be, for example, that people (in the jane austen era) married into wealth as a tactic of wealth-creation. Or, alternatively, people are for-going marriage (as in the &quot;cant have it all generatinon&quot;) as a means to facilitate of wealth creation (or, even: protection). But these are wholly different effects/causes than the broad relatinships of wealth to marital status. They involve the precise staus of marriage itself. Furthermore, they may or may not have any bearing on the develepment of Children...so far, children haven&#x27;t even been a consideration in the determinants of marriage (ei, access to sex, wealth acquisition, weath protection). The status of children may wholly be an emergent phenomenon (of marriage) or it may actually be linked to the quality of the principals (absent special instituyional support).<p>So, in the big scheme of things, waving around macro stuff is a bit hand-wavey. It&#x27;s quite a bit more important to look at the micro-analytics and actually (a) assess them; and (b) apply them to the context at hand.<p>On that, I think I agree with the author of the linked essay.",1390780543

Both CUDA and C++AMP are good languages for programming heterogeneous machines and nVidia&#x27;s Thrust and Microsoft&#x27;s PPL are both excellent libraries to write efficient and reusable code. These language extensions are also strongly typed and come with really good tools. My advice is: learn any of them instead.<p>Why not OpenCL? AMD&#x27;s Bolt library is the live proof that OpenCL is fxxxxx up beyond all repair. It is not meant for humans to write, nor for machines to understand.<p>Kernels are just character strings!!! This is just so wrong! Forget about using functors and lambdas as kernels, and forget about mixing kernels with templates. You will be better off using Python and PyOpenCL (which is great) that using C and C++. In C++ generating kernels is really hard, and generating kernels from expression templates is insanely hard.<p>Furthermore, this also means that the language is not typed at all!! Forgetting a semicolon in C results in a runtime error! Do you want syntax highlighting? Write your kernels in separate files! This is even worse than the way people used to write functors far away from the call site in C++03, at least they were in the same file!<p>As stated above my advice is don&#x27;t learn it. Let it die. Your time is better spent learning CUDA/C++AMP and their libraries. The design rules for OpenCL have been &quot;let&#x27;s not learn anything from OpenGL&quot; + &quot;we need something, this is something, let&#x27;s standarize this&quot;. This of course has resulted in an hilarious language that came after CUDA and was worse in every possible way.",1390779811

It shows an attitude about laws as being just suggestions that you can also compare against your morality.  I certainly agree on many points, for example people who do things on a small scale that are technically illegal (e.g. sodomy where it was illegal, etc).  The context and morality does matter.<p>But in this particular case, the laws exist for quite an important and good reason.  Do you know why?  It seems to be for the exact case that&#x27;s happening here.  Ignoring the laws shielding the public, because you don&#x27;t see anything unethical in it, seems, well, akin to ignoring fraud laws because you don&#x27;t see anything wrong with committing fraud.<p>For example, why shouldn&#x27;t I be able to print money (on an inkjet printer) - it might be technically illegal, but is it immoral?  It&#x27;s immoral because you make money from people accepting something that is worthless, and devalues people&#x27;s faith in the real thing.<p>Pump and dump schemes have a similar effect on real investment markets, and are illegal for this reason.",1390779108

He wasn&#x27;t the janitor or some clueless field agent.<p>• Did Snowden expose operational shortcomings?  Absolutely.  A lot of the programs that have been publicly revealed through his leaks have been running for over a decade without ever seeing the light of day, though.  That tells me these &quot;pervasive operational shortcomings&quot; aren&#x27;t very pervasive.  (If they were, the NSA would be absolute shit at their mission.)<p>• I don&#x27;t think Andrea is a &quot;high value target,&quot; or at least high value enough to risk compromising whatever method they might use to bug her keyboard.  I don&#x27;t say this to belittle her or her work in any way — she seems to be a skilled programmer/hacker/infosec person.  And that&#x27;s exactly why this whole &quot;the NSA is bugging her keyboard&quot; theory doesn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>Let&#x27;s assume for the sake of argument that the NSA had planned to bug her keyboard, and that keyboard is now sitting in an NSA (or contractor) facility in/near Alexandria, Virginia, waiting for some modification to be made before shipping it back out.  But, oops, they screwed up and forgot to fake the USPS tracking information.  They know she knows because she tweeted about it.  She&#x27;s also tweeted that she can never trust the keyboard if/when it shows up.  Why would they ship her a bugged keyboard at this point?  If/when the keyboard shows up, she&#x27;s probably going to take it apart and share anything interesting she finds with the world.  There will be hard evidence.<p>Even if they hadn&#x27;t bungled the tracking information in our hypothetical argument, they&#x27;re risking exposure of the exact methods they use to bug a machine for not much potential gain.  (Remember, Andrea&#x27;s a skilled hacker/programmer.  There&#x27;s a very good chance she&#x27;ll figure out what&#x27;s going on and tell the world if she has any inkling that her laptop&#x27;s been tampered with.)<p>• The keyboard she ordered fits a ThinkPad T60/T61/T400/T500 (and the equivalent &quot;R&quot; models, plus a few others).  Internally, the keyboard and TrackPoint speak PS/2.  While they could log keystrokes to an on-board chip and transmit keystrokes via radio, there aren&#x27;t any especially interesting things the NSA can do to her laptop via a modified keyboard.  They certainly won&#x27;t be rooting it that way.<p>• I said that I don&#x27;t think Andrea is a &quot;high value target,&quot; despite her work on Tor, because everything about Tor is open.  Anyone can download the code and see exactly how it works.  The protocol is well-known.  There&#x27;s no curtain to peek behind and gain strategic information about Tor&#x27;s workings.<p>So while I don&#x27;t reject the argument that the NSA is trying to bug her laptop as impossible, I think it&#x27;s exceedingly improbable.  My money&#x27;s still on &quot;seller screwed up the tracking number.&quot;<p><i>I also like the part where the NSA is guarded by the Catch-22 &quot;it wasn&#x27;t them, because if it was, you&#x27;d never know&quot;, such that that there&#x27;s no scenario in which you could be convinced that the NSA did anything.</i><p>The flip side of this argument, which everyone here seems to be clutching onto and running with, is that if the NSA is capable of it, they&#x27;re doing it at every available opportunity, even when it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to.",1390779072

Anyone selling will put their orders below that wall, and as you slowly move the wall downwards people will sell into the market in the expectation that they can buy again once you&#x27;ve pushed the price lower than where they sold.<p>This relies on the large wall not being an attractive offer for someone who has the purchasing power to obliterate it, which is where it occasionally fails. Generally, if the market starts to move against it with any force, it&#x27;s pulled or moved further back behind other orders.<p>Another way this can be used is by putting up a wall on the opposite side of your real order to drive demand - i.e. in the scenario above, you might be trying to buy at 220. If you put up a huge wall at 224, people will be more willing to fill your order at 220 than if the orderbook was much thinner.<p>It seems this is called spoofing in the financial world.",1390778471

This is often accompanied by banging on about the importance of what are really just clerical operations.<p>PARC, like any office of a large organisation, was invariably subject to revisionist history, office politics and all sorts of other nonsense, but attempting to deny the fact they did produce the direction for our last 30 years (and possibly into the near future) is ludicrous, much as a similar rant against Bell Labs would be  misguided.<p>Most specifically he glosses over the fact that the nature of applications in the environments at PARC had far blurrier lines around the edges than say iOS apps do. They had things like OLE, which the web is clearly trending to recreate in the form of web components because though implementations have sucked the idea itself makes sense to people.<p>Paying close attention to the ideas from PARC you can see that the real philosophical difference is Nelson is closer to the idea of an all ruling single document format - whereas the vision PARC believed in was an all ruling single code format.

I don&#x27;t have any of these here with me right now but this has happened to me with a number of relatively common models from HP and Dell, when installing XP over Vista (can&#x27;t recall if Win 7 was available at the time). The company had not moved their support package images to Vista, for compatibility and security reasons - telecom company with funky email servers and a policy of installing as old and boring software as possible.<p>There simply was no support. The solution HP, Dell and MS would give is to &quot;get on with the times and migrate&quot; which wasn&#x27;t possible at the time. Alternatively, buy another computer with specific XP support. Complaints were met with a &quot;RTF EULA&quot; where it stated that no support was guaranteed for other OS than the preinstalled one.<p>The solution was to buy new laptops with WinXP support (ended up costing more, since the company specifically needed serial ports and not many machines had them + WinXP support, limiting choice).<p>Ubuntu installed flawlessly with absolutely every feature the hardware supported.(This happened when we basically had to either find some new usage for the machines or throw them away). Much quicker than XP too, and objectively simpler as it would choose reasonable defaults instead of asking esoteric questions, making us call phone numbers or insisting in us registering anything. The single thing XP has on Ubuntu or Mint regarding installation, is that you often don&#x27;t have to do it yourself. In some respects it&#x27;s worse with newer MS systems as their DRM has &quot;intensified&quot; and OEMs ship more resilient bloatware/rootkits.<p>Small division within biggish company, so the process was followed by some of us, including me although I wasn&#x27;t in IT.",1390777314

Now that engines are more reliable, the regulations are significantly more relaxed, sometimes allowing 330 minutes to a diversion airport.<p>The point is, regulations are not set in stone.  Companies can advance the state of the art, and ask the government to regulate less strictly.<p>As it stands now, self-driving cars are a research project, so we&#x27;d expect them to be regulated very strictly.  As testing shows them to be safe, then we can relax the regulations.

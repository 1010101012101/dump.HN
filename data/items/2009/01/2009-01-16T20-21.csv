So I wrote up a short blog post with my findings and my concern for the future utility of the site if this trend continued. (This was before the front page was littered with dick and fart jokes).<p>So I took my little blog post and did what any geek would do: I submitted it to Digg!<p>What followed was a rash of insults and attempts to hack my blog (one successful attempt). It was then that I realized (in general) the types of people frequenting the site, and knew the honeymoon wouldn't last long.<p>When I came to HN I saw something right away that concerned me. There was this guy named 'nickb' whose submissions dominated the front page. ""Oh noes, here we go again"" I thought, ""He must have started the site or something.""<p>I still don't know who nickb is but I realized after time that his submissions tend to rock hard tasty abs, and thats why he gets upmodded so often. Sure, pg's articles hit #1 every time, but thats because they're interesting, not because of his celebrity.<p>This little anecdote explains one reason I like HN over Digg (and probably Reddit). I think it explains it better than the pic on Flickr, but I may be biased. =]",1232139469

437231,comment,436575,437014,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""If, as you say, naturopaths are just practicing scientific medicine but using plants rather than chemicals, all they are doing is adding a new source of errors to traditional medicine.""<p>The theory is that when plants have powerful drugs in them, they usually also have other mechanisms to prevent those drugs from being toxic. The idea being that eating the whole plant is often less harmful than taking a massive dose of one specific chemical. For example, people die every year by OD'ing on Red Bull or caffeine pills, but hardly anyone ever dies by drinking too much green tea. Why? Green tea has lots of acid and other stuff that'll make you throw up long before you can drink enough to kill yourself.<p>There are many other things that traditional doctors won't tell you take because they are illegal. For example, coca tea is far less likely to have nasty side effects than the altitude pills your doctor prescribes you, but your doctor isn't allowed to prescribe you coca tea because it's illegal.<p>And of course most doctors also accept bribes from the pharmaceutical industry. Every few months we see huge articles in the NY Times to this effect. Think of how many times your traditional doctor has advised you to take a plant-- probably never. Because plants aren't patentable and the pharma industry isn't there giving your doctor free trips to hawaii if he tells you to smoke weed for your bone cancer instead of taking some dangerous chemical compound.<p>Of course the dosages are a lot more variable than if you just got a pill, but that's why you go back to your naturopathic doctor every week or so instead of just taking a fixed dosage and going back if it gets worse. The whole idea is that the medicine is based around what makes you feel better, not what works for the average person as compared to a placebo.",1232138513

437211,comment,436989,437118,0,0,jm4,,,"I'd say it's a ways off considering how many years they've spent trying to shoot down much larger missiles with lasers. A missile moves much faster than a bird, but the small size of a bird is going to make it extremely difficult. There's also the issue of how to deal with a flock of birds. This, of course, is assuming you've figured out how to cost-effectively equip hundreds of passenger jets with lasers and the necessary tracking systems given the space constraints. I understand power is also an issue when shooting down missiles. I'm not sure how significantly this requirement is reduced when shooting down birds.<p>There's also the issue of using a weapon over heavily populated areas and at low altitude. Shooting down a missile will probably take place at high altitude. It's also possible, or even likely, that it will take place over a sparsely populated area or war zone. It could even be over an ocean. The laser might even be fired upwards. If you're shooting down birds from a plane there's a good chance you're going to be firing a laser outward or downward. What if you miss and start blasting holes through nearby buildings?<p>Bird strikes tend to be a problem most often during takeoff and landing-- usually at either end of the runway. Planes gain altitude so quickly that it's rarely a problem outside of a couple short windows as the plane is approaching or leaving the runway area. I remember reading about an airport with an especially bad bird problem that had success using dogs to keep birds away from the runways.<p>I think there is a simple solution to this. It might even be possible to put plants or grass around the runway that birds don't like. What about something with thorns that will be difficult for a bird to perch on?

In 1921 Terman and his colleagues began a longitudinal study of 1,528 gifted youth with IQs greater than 140 who were approximately 12 years old. Over a period of approximately 40 years, the researchers laid the groundwork for our understanding of giftedness and paved the way for efforts to identify and nurture giftedness in school. Terman died in 1959 but the study will continue until 2020, to encompass the entire lives of his original 1528 gifted youth. Results of the study have been published in several volumes</i><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=KQ4rLiAbHQQC&pg=PA41&vq=terman&dq=terman&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1_1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=KQ4rLiAbHQQC&pg=PA41&#3...</a><p><i>Intelligence is an important determinant of lifetime achivement. The classical study demonstrating this association was carried out by Lewis Terman and his colleagues. The study began around 1920 by intelligence testing a large number of children in California. From this sample they selected 1,528 (857 boys and 671 girls) with IQs of 135 and above. The minimum IQ of 135 represents approximately the top one percent of the population. The average IQ of the total sample was 151 (Terman, 1925).<p>These children were followed up thirty-five years after their initial identification when they were in their early forties. By this time, the authors of the follow-up concluded that ""the superior child, with few exceptions, becomes the able adult, superior in nearly every respect to the generality"" (Terman and Oden, 1959, p. 143).<p>Terman and his associated found that 70 percent of their sample had graduated from college; two fifths of the men and three fifths of the women had gone through graduate school. Of the men, 86 percent were in the two highest socioeconomic categories of professions and management. None of these individuals were in the lowest socioeconomic category of unskilled workers, as compared with 13 percent of the male population at that time. Seventy of the men were listed in</i> American Men of Science, <i>and three had been elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Thirty-one were listed in</i> Who's Who in America. <i>Between them, they had produced nearly 2000 scientific papers, some 60 books in the sciences, 230 patents, and 33 novels. Fourteen percent of the men did not fulfill the promise of their high IQs and failed to obtain socioeconomic class one or two occupations. These men were almost all impaired by psychiatric problems or lack of motivation.<p>Among the women, most of them became housewives and mothers and consequently did not have such visible achievements. Nevertheless, seven women were listed in</i> American Men of Science <i>and two in</i> Who's Who in America. <i>Between them they had produced 32 scholarly books, 5 novels, more than 200 scientific papers, and 5 patents.</i>",1232137223

It seems that migrations give you a pretty good level of softness in your data models when you need it. Of course, I think a lot of Rails apps do end up with much of their logic in the M part of MVC. And understandably, some folks are not very comfortable with that.<p>Can anyone speak from experience on this? Talking about mature Rails apps now. Are Rails migrations a help or hindrance in terms of 'app aging'?",1232136823

Instead, each person’s mind contains a panoply of instincts, strategies, intuitions, emotions, memories and habits, which vie for supremacy.</i><p>I can't express how badly I want this meme to take hold! I've wondered for years why anyone can believe that humans are rational agents in the face of the existence of the huge marketing apparatus present in advanced economies. I mean, if we really are rational decision-making agents, why does a manufacturer pay someone to come up with a jingle? To engineer a fad via guerrilla marketing? To create brand impressions by slapping a logo on a race car or sports stadium? All of these techniques, and all of the other successful marketing techniques out there, survive precisely because humans can be persuaded to spend money irrationally.<p>""So what?,"" you say? Well, that great artifice, ""Classical Free Market Theory,"" rests on the foundation of rational agents making locally optimal solutions with imperfect information. It seems to me to predict, for example, that there's no profit to be made anywhere in a steady state condition. The rational masses, so the theory goes, will always seek the cheapest goods that meet the need, regardless of brand recognition, sexy women placed next to sports cars, or celebrity endorsement. In this case, every competitive scenario results in goods being produced at cost.<p>Thankfully (I think), this is not the case, and there is a way to wealth that is left open. Namely, a successful entrepreneur needs to be present when people are making non-rational decisions with their money. This is not to say that these are bad decisions, or that the entrepreneur needs to be unscrupulous. It's just an acknowledgment of the fact that rational decision-making in a quasi-equilibirum economic scenario results in zero profit margin.",1232136223

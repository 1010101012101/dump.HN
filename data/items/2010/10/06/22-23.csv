Perhaps I could raise my rates, but I think I lose money more by a) not properly estimating timelines and b) becoming idle while waiting for client feedback/help/etc.  As I said, I'm only 6 mo. into it, so I'm still learning how to better handle these things.  I'm finding that when I go into a client's office to code, they are more inclined to provide me the resources they need and I feel ok billing them for the hours, even if they've left me idly waiting for their input.",1286405852

How sensitive is this? If I have a name I can find a phone number through this magic book called the white pages.

Phone calls similarly are not hard to report and get blocked.<p>I use my google contacts as my phone's contacts with exchange ActiveSync and linking to Facebook and Linked is great - it allows me to create email groups very easily and always have to hand an email address or a phone number on my phone or on a desktop endpoint.

Firefox is the only browser that allows this via the gfx.color_management.mode switch. This is important because not all page graphics are images and there's no way to tag a CSS element, for example.",1286402873

I personally just get swamped and neglect sending out updates.<p>Many times candidates are also applying for several roles and may not follow up on their own. I think the worst blunder is when a candidate desires feedback and gets only silence. Note that people, in general, hate delivering bad news ""You were too weak on core Java / bad breath"" and so avoid the conversation.<p>The recruiters in the field for several years (5+) sometimes place a candidate 2-3 x in new positions. Recruiters keep up with the rock-star talent, which is always in high demand.<p>It gets difficult to remember who does / is what if they are middle/average when burning through 200 profiles a day or 50 calls / day.

I am primarily a web programmer, but most of the projects I work on have or already had excellent designers work on them, which makes my portfolio projects that much more appealing.<p>However, I find your work-acquisition strategy a little shallow. The best thing I can recommend is to spend a decent amount of time crafting your message (even if its as simple as ""I make websites for small businesses""). Consistency and clarity is key here over specialization.<p>Once you have a clear consistent message tell everyone, especially non-technical folks. As the article said, its a numbers game. By doing this, I have found clients through friends of friends who talked about me, twitter, and my mom even picked up a project for me at her book club.<p>If you can manage your own projects, I would branch out from just working with firms that already hire/manage designers/devs (freelance or not). There's an endless supply of businesses that hire contractors without having technical managers and then end up extremely unhappy (at the least). If you're competent, a good communicator and transparent with the client, you'll easily wow them over and over again. Further, these clients will pay consulting rates (min $100/hr) rather than designer/developer rates ($50-$75/hr).",1286402571

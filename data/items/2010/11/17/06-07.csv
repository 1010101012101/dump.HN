Wordpress's choice of PHP meant that installation was easy, theming/modification was easy, and it would work on your crappy shared host with FTP access.

We floated the issue on various places in LinkedIn (the places are frequented globally). We got a good response, but I wanted to start with a local effort first. There was no India specific place where I could have floated the idea to get the feedback. Did that at Hacker News India & got the validation results. I think its a great place for people, not only to validate their idea inside India, but also to show-case their India-specific effort to Indian audience.

Being thrust into the limelight to be mocked and laughed at is a really great opportunity to take one on the chin and own up to your mistakes, and then to turn that around into positive press about how you screwed up and how you're fixing it moving forward. Cook's Source has visibility easily several orders of magnitude greater than it did before this whole debacle, and all you need is to convert a small number of those to your product to make some mighty tasty lemonade out of those lemons.<p>Instead, the editor took the opportunity to further expose the traits that caused the uproar in the first place - self-importance, arrogance, and ignorance. The ""apology"" is no more than a half-hearted attempt at deflection and a misplaced plea for pity. It will both fail to deflect the bad press, and will not garner any pity.<p>This is an excellent lesson in how to not handle customer relationships, management of negative press, and fixing your mistakes. Entrepreneurs, take note - look at what Cook's Source did, and don't do that. Always assume you are at fault first. When you are at fault, go the extra mile to make it right.

1913171,comment,1912530,1912530,0,0,blahedo,,,"""Make it possible for programmers to write in English and you will find the programmers cannot write in English.""<p>I teach computer science and have a particular fondness for introductory CS.  The reason Stephen Wolfram is wrong, wrong, wrong about this is that people that have never been taught programming can't express themselves precisely enough in their native language, either; and even among those of us that have been programming for decades, when we express ourselves in natural language we <i>can</i> be very precise but it takes a lot more work and becomes a lot more unwieldy than just writing out our instructions in [pseudo]code.<p>CS educators have been wishing for a long time that ""intro to CS"" didn't equate to ""intro to programming"".  And it doesn't have to, not quite, but the reason it always seems to revert there is that the prerequisite for <i>every other thing in CS</i> is, not programming itself, but a certain precision of thought that is easiest to teach just by teaching students to program.  In a programming language.  Because if you try to make them write out instructions in a natural language, and you notice that they aren't being precise and therefore deliberately misinterpret that instruction, they just think you're being a dick about it.  They sometimes even think this if you honestly misinterpret them.  (This is true even in a non-CS context.)<p>Saying that we will soon be ""generating code from natural language"" is, at best, misleading.  It implies that people who couldn't learn a programming language will be able to program, which is quite untrue---I promise that with the possible rare exception of a few pathological edge cases, when people can't learn to program, the language is the least of their problems.  And for those of us that <i>can</i> and <i>do</i> learn programming languages, all but the simplest sorts of programs will probably be easier to write in a programming language (which was designed for that sort of thing) than in a natural language (which was not).<p>(And holding up Mathematica as an exemplar is particularly egregious; it is so loaded with syntax that ""just works"" that you need to either have a deep familiarity with traditional mathematical notation or else a degree-level CS background in programming language theory if you want to have a good shot at learning the language in anything more than a pattern-matching fill-in-the-blank way.)",1289975409

I usually tell people it's ""...mostly garbage-collected,"" which tries to convey the flavor of a choice between fine-grained systems-level control and instantiate-and-forget application-level control.<p>To be fair to the author, I'm going to assume that the most esoteric (read: non-C-like) language he knows is probably Python, because he doesn't compare it to anything besides Python, C, C++, or Java. I also assume he left out Java because by ""compiled languages"" he meant ""compiled to native code without relying on a runtime which is external to the compiled application."" He's still missing a whole swath of compiled languages, but there is a point of view from which his comment makes sense, i.e. native-code compilation of C-like systems or applications languages.<p>(""...you will find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view."")",1289975384

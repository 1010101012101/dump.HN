1885527,comment,1884685,1885458,0,0,danudey,,,"I can't give any benchmarks, but I was doing a compile (openssh) the other day, and I noticed something peculiar.<p>I started the ./configure, and it blasted through 40 or 50 checks almost instantly, then stopped. Suddenly, it started taking about 3-5 seconds for each check (i.e. 'check for blarg in -lfoo'). For the rest of the compile, it was like I'd gone back in time ten years; incredibly slow. Checking top, it showed the %steal at 99.5-100% - the host system was scheduling almost no CPU at all to my machine.<p>Playing around, I found that you basically get a specific allotment of CPU cycles per a certain amount of time, and once you run out you don't get any more for a while (other than the bare minimum to keep the server working). This makes it great for 'bursty' load cases, but after you burst burst, they cut you off, so it's terrible if you suddenly get a sustained burst of traffic.<p>It's so bad that I spun up a clone of the machine, compiled SSH there, and then spun it down afterwards, which turned out to take easily half the time as compiling it on the micro instance itself.<p>So: great for personal blogs; terrible for suddenly getting traffic to your personal blogs.",1289282145

We have 6 virtual servers with them. They are cheap and perform well, their control panel is great and they have tons of great pre-configured OS installs. However downtime can sometimes be an issue. Usually it's not major, e.g. a server will just be unavailable for say 30 seconds or maybe a few minutes, but this happens probably an average of once or twice a month for each of our servers so it can get annoying. Like I said though the outages are usually minor. There's only been one that I remember that was major, and lasted several hours. We've been using VPS.net for about 8 months and overall are very happy with them. Not sure I'd recommend them for your setup but we only use them for a custom built CDN and for that it works very well.",1289281995

1885517,comment,1885448,1885448,0,0,gaelian,,,"I guess it depends how private the data needs to be. My view is that for stuff that's even vaguely sensitive, it would be nuts not to use TLS/SSL for data in motion. But you also need to think about whether it's acceptable for the data to reside with whoever will be on the receiving end.<p>At my day job, the intranet is hosted internally on servers within the premises, but this is more for historical reasons than security concerns. There are a number of other file servers etc. that are kept in-house for historical reasons and because they contain sensitive information. satellite offices are connected to the main office by a VPN.<p>Our public websites are hosted external to the office network on a VPS. I tend to be a little obsessive about making sure that all possibly sensitive traffic that goes between our local network and our VPS is encrypted (admin interface over https, SSH sessions, FTPS etc.) and because there's really nothing on the public websites that shouldn't be public anyway, I'm happy to trust the hosting provider with that data.<p>We're thinking of giving Yammer a go for adding to internal communications and I will of course be recommending that we use TLS/SSL with Yammer should the idea go ahead. There's so many of these hosted services these days, it would seem like shame to dismiss them all just because they're hosted and you need to travel across the Internet to get to them. I prefer to look at things on more of a case by case basis and weigh the pros and cons.<p>To oversimplify a complex issue: encrypt data in motion across untrusted networks, make sure you trust where the data is ending up (whether you're encrypting it at rest as well or not). Or host it internally and make sure your own network is secure and reliable.<p>So in my experience from the places I've worked, I guess you could say it's usually a little from column A and a little from column B. Larger organisations seem to be warming to the idea of taking advantage of the cloud more and more these days when previously they would more likely opt to host stuff in-house.",1289281842

1885468,comment,1884956,1885227,0,0,derefr,,,"I think the real point here—the one that half the article was spent in making—is that Lisp (the grammar that uses lots of parentheses) <i>isn't the same as</i> Lisp (the concept).<p>Lisp (the concept) isn't a <i>language</i> at all, as far as we use the term to describe something that humans can use to communicate information serially. Lisp is actually a <i>model</i> for representing a transformation of an AST <i>as</i> an AST—no more, and no less. To communicate a Lisp transformation model, we must <i>encode</i> it as a stream of characters—and that stream, if we don't do anything to <i>make</i> it readable, becomes the ""degenerate case"" of programming languages: pure S-expression syntax.<p>However, there's no need for Lisp and S-expressions to go hand-in-hand. For decades we've known that programming languages have UX considerations every bit as important as those of the programs made with them. Lisp precedes that realization, but even when Lisp was first invented, S-expressions were never intended to be its primary encoding (search ""M-expressions"".) It just turned out that Lisp was such a powerful model that it was immediately put to use before a nicer syntax could be wrapped around it. (Also, its core user-base were <i>mathematicians</i>, who already had the isomorphic Lambda-calculus notation to think in terms of, so the learning curve wasn't evident to them.)<p>The point I'm getting at, here, is that any programming language <i>syntax</i> can have Lisp-transformation-model <i>semantics</i>. As long as `read` and `eval` are separate functions of your compiler+runtime, and the AST that normally travels between the two can be manipulated by your own code, <i>you have a Lisp</i>.<p>That's what people mean when they say that ""the parentheses don't matter.""",1289280508

Outsourcing/offshoring was all the rage and it was tempting for a mid-sized web company to think, ""you know, our processes are starting to break down now that releasing buggy code causes a lot more problems, but it's going to take months to build a QA team... let's offshore it!""<p>It's not trivial.  If your software development process can be described as, ""some business guy writes an e-mail with four sentences and a developer works with him to implement the feature"" or ""production and dev environments are never in sync, but devs double as sysadmins and have access to production so they just modify configuration as necessary,"" then offshoring/outsourcing QA is doomed to fail.  You need things like detailed specs and a consistent QA environment.  I had projects that took 4 days to develop but 2 months to QA because every ""bug"" was either a) actually an intended feature or b) some inconsistency with my dev and their QA environment.

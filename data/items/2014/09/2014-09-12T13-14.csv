It thereby follows that it it not ok to not have a channel of communication. This implies that emails who are sent to the support address must have the option to be responded to - if they are important enough. Because if they are all just never answered, this is the same as not having a communication channel in the first place.<p>My guess is that it has to be a ranking based on importance. Of course it is necessary to answer each one, like &quot;How do I find the google website&quot;. But it might be that - in germany - things like having an account closed people relied upon in good faith and than not responding to inquiries why is problematic, given that this can high and monetary personal consequences (violation of customer protection laws, to which all of this is referring - and yes, this is not fully dependent on whether they pay. Imagine important document stored only there - maybe created there, so it is not totally not understandable not having a backup already - and then lost, thus causing a million dollar company to fail. I&#x27;m exaggerating, but stuff like that).<p>Further, having an available contact channel is necessary to be able to submit legal documents, though I expect that Google has another avenue for that already.",1410530338

If you&#x27;re forced to do support, set tiers of support based on the tiers of your plan. Free users get basic support with a 5-7 day SLA. Paid users get far better. However, if it&#x27;s advertised to me as being $50 and I am using it for free, I&#x27;m not a customer. I&#x27;m not using it as advertised.<p>Would this change the business model of a lot of start ups? You bet it would. But it would change it for the better in the customer&#x27;s eyes. Maybe the &quot;free tier&quot; becomes the free trial, time-limited. Maybe paid users will no longer subsidize the paid users. Maybe companies will think through their business model a little more and not offer free service for just long enough to get embedded in someone&#x27;s life then realize they have to shut down for lack of money.<p>I would love to see a shift from &quot;user&quot; to &quot;customer&quot;.

Still, I&#x27;m not following you:<p>I&#x27;m not getting your answer to the question of why\nthe sudden knowledge of the child conceived, say, before the marriage, broke up the (long) marriage?  My answer is that either (1) evidence of adultery or (2) (as you claim is argued in this thread, no adultery so) lack of open communications, that is, lack of that part of <i>intimate love</i>.  To me, answer (2) looks tough to believe.  That is, why break up love, home, and marriage over a <i>love child</i> conceived before the marriage, especially given the chance that the man was unaware of the pregnancy?  Since you also don&#x27;t like answer (1), adultery, I&#x27;m left without knowing what your explanation is.<p>My personal preferences aside, if adultery is the only believable answer, then it looks like someone regarded adultery as a really serious problem, enough to break up love, home, and marriage, and, thus, evidence of strong respect for (my) <i>traditional family values</i>.<p>And, you lost me on a second point:  It seems that you are saying that the <i>important glue</i> of a romantic relationship, with marriage or not, is having children and not really just sexual intercourse.  In that case, given that the marriage did have children, why use sexual intercourse, with children or not, from adultery or not, as a reason to break up the marriage?<p>I&#x27;ll try to be more clear:  A <i>traditional</i> view of much of the <i>meaning</i> of sexual intercourse is the implied <i>bonding</i> and, thus, <i>joining</i> of two lives.  It&#x27;s mostly the promise of long term love, bonding, joining, security, etc. that makes sexual intercourse attractive and important.  In this way, sexual intercourse becomes important in the marriage, even without children yet or ever.  But in part you seem to be saying (1) what is important about sexual intercourse in the marriage is any resulting conceptions yet (2) are saying that loss of love and home, beyond considerations of children, is a tragedy.  So, it seems that with (1) you are saying that sexual intercourse without children is not very important but with (2) you are saying that loss of that part of love is important.  You seem to be saying that Bob and Martha can have a great marriage with three great children, still are <i>swingers</i> and have semi-public sexual intercourse with a crowd of strangers or casual friends, yet break up their marriage once there is knowledge of a <i>love child</i> conceived before the marriage.  I can understand traditional values and even swingers, but I can&#x27;t understand how such parts of those two can be combined in one marriage.",1410528057

Rather, it taught me that the adage that a grand jury will indict a ham sandwich is an understatement. A better description would be that the prosecution can show a grand jury a shit sandwich and they will indict it as ham without looking up from their newspapers. The notion that the Supreme Court relies upon — that the grand jury has a &quot;historical role of protecting individuals from unjust persecution&quot; — is not a polite fiction. A polite fiction would have some grounding in reality.

Answering myself that it only does if Google hits a homerun based on:<p>+ Vendor/plat-form lock-in.<p>+ Data mining startups&#x27; traffic.<p>+ Access to startups&#x27; code and data.<p>+ Ability to pull the plug.<p>For Vendor/Platform lock-in this could be virtual, ie the burden of switching the code base for administrative tasks to Amazon or Azure or some other provider could be prohibitive.

That really could be, Apple has spent much time and money getting consumers excited about these events and, perhaps, squandered some of this excitement.<p>I am also not a big fan of choice.

I just kind of chuckled to myself. I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve heard that but it started back in the 80s. I&#x27;ve learned to never think I can predict what people will do when it comes to Apple products. When the iPad came out I kind of shrugged and thought it wouldn&#x27;t do as well as they thought. Within 6 months I was in NYC working on iPad apps and the thing was selling like ice water on a hot summer day.<p>Something I learned in poker: Don&#x27;t project your own thoughts onto others if you want to predict their actions.

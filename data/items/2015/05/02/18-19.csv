9478110,comment,9477124,9477972,0,0,nopinsight,,,"Part of your comment may be partially true, but the truth is likely much deeper and subtler. I&#x27;d say much of it is a bit Western bias. Abstractions come in different flavors and are tied to worldview. Most people in the West (except learners of Asian traditions) also have problems understanding concepts like Tao, Buddhism&#x27;s Nirvana, Confucius&#x27; filial piety even when they know the words for them. A similar thing may happen in China which compelled the comment of yours.<p>(My native language is Thai, which is somewhat related to Chinese, and both share many characteristics. I also know a bit of Chinese and Japanese. I think a lot about languages in my job, NLU research)<p>English might have an advantage representing Western-style abstraction, not because of its inherent linguistic nature, but the culture surrounding its uses. China, Thailand, and many other countries in Asia just started its industrialization recently and one can argue that they have not gone through a European-style Enlightenment. Many of the Western abstract concepts in Chinese and Thai are imported, rather than invented, and thus have shallower roots and limited penetration in societies. Less educated and traditionally educated people might not wholly understand them even if they have heard them mentioned in passing in a documentary or foreign news. Neologisms are invented to represent these concepts, often fairly easily since compound words are in common use in both; but for most people to deeply understand them is a different issue.<p><i>So my question is what groups of monolingual population in China do you interact with and draw conclusions from?</i> If they are not the new elites who had much education in Western tradition and worldview, their issues with Western abstract concepts may not really be of linguistic nature, but related to worldview.<p>Note on representing emotions:\nThai and Chinese use tones for meaning, but they have particle words for emotions and social cues. These are more expressive in writing compared to English. Spoken voice usually comes with emotional tones (pitch and loudness vary in these languages too) so people can almost always tell the emotions if the speaker does not hide them. So I disagree with your point about emotional expressiveness.",1430593038

(F--K YEAH!)<p>We can&#x27;t be using any of those sissy languages made in Switzerland!<p>The real tragedy is that [Turbo] Pascal / Modula / Oberon / Eiffel never got any traction.  We could have been ahead of where we are now for low / medium low level languages DECADES ago.<p>E.g. - Turbo Pascal:<p>* Checks array boundaries, but you can cobble up pointer arithmetic if you really need to squeeze something (it looks funny, as it <i>should</i>, but it converts into the same assembly code as ptr += size ; <i>ptr)<p></i> references (&quot;var&quot; params) used safely as non-optional values in most cases, using pointers for parameters that are truly optional.<p>* much stricter type checking and type range restriction allowed - most of which is only paid for at compile time, rather than run time.<p>* faster compiles, allowing quicker test cycles.<p>I suppose Ada fits in this group as well, but it was expensive in the late 80s.<p>Modern GC languages do well for long running application server programs, but they don&#x27;t make good &quot;transient&quot; utility programs.

But it&#x27;s not too late for the Rust crowd to blow it.  Rust may have too much cruft at version 1.0 for C programmers.<p>Things that worry me about Rust:<p>* Too much mandatory metaprogramming.  Basic things such as I/O require generics, and even lambdas.   Rust&#x27;s cruft level in this area picks up where C++ with Boost left off.<p>* Error handling is too verbose.  Wrapping things in &quot;Result<>&quot; and &quot;Some<>&quot;, then unwrapping them with &quot;match&quot; is wordy. Wrapping that in generics makes it shorter but hides what&#x27;s happening.<p>* The type system and type inference are very complex, and type errors induced from another module can be hard to diagnose.<p>* Too much language churn.  Supposedly &quot;stable&quot; modules still keep changing.  I&#x27;m surprised when I recompile a program after a few weeks and it still works.  This needs to settle down very soon.<p>* Resource Allocation is Initialization. Initialization isn&#x27;t that bad, but what do you do about an error discovered in a destructor?  Destructors are always troublesome, and Rust doesn&#x27;t seem to have that area under control. A &quot;with&quot; clause approach would have been cleaner. The recent discovery of a soundness problem in Rust destructors is being handled in a way that bears watching.  First, the actual issue reporting the problem was closed without a fix.[1] The discussion was &quot;moved to an RFC&quot; so as not to block the release of Rust 1.0.[2] Related issues are now being discussed to death. A good discussion of the issue is at [3].<p>While Rust avoids complex run-time abstractions, it has very complex compile-time abstractions. Rust has all the cool abstraction ideas - closures, generics, templates, type inference, RAII, functional programming, etc. This may be too much for the C crowd. The basic libraries use all these features, so you can&#x27;t restrict their use on a project.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24456"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24456</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1066"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1066</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2015/04/29/on-reference-counting-and-leaks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2015/04/29/on-r...</a>",1430592321

Occasionally opening items in a new background tab.<p>Probably that&#x27;s where this UI works best, for apps where the person is going to look at many thousands of items, and no ranking exists that can do a decent job, for the particular user&#x27;s needs other than at a rough level. Women&#x27;s fashion shopping (e.g. pinterest and shopping clones of pinterest) seem to be an ideal example of that.<p>By the way, fashion is an interesting example of being anti-ranking. If something gets too popular, it suddenly becomes unfasionable again by the rules of fashion.",1430592295

This does not determine their salary, it&#x27;s market data for us, and the future part also makes sure that Automattic is a place that can meet their long-term goals and expectations, or if not that&#x27;s discussed up front.<p>I&#x27;ve had this conversation about 400 times at this point, while people can sometimes be sensitive around compensation, it&#x27;s like discussing a health issue with your doctor -- I&#x27;ve seen and heard it all and it&#x27;s part of a normal days work for me. It&#x27;s sometimes the source of a nice surprise, as we&#x27;ve had people who&#x27;ve doubled or trebled their salary when joining Automattic which always brightens my day. We&#x27;ve also had people take a small or substantial cut when joining, which isn&#x27;t ideal, but we determine salaries as I said above, not based on what they say they previously made, and it&#x27;s good information for the company to have because hopefully one day as our business or their contribution to it grows it&#x27;d be great to have them at or above what the market said they could make someplace else. I can only think of only once someone has not joined because of compensation, an engineer at Yahoo who had compensation 3-4x beyond what seemed fair in the market commensurate with his skills or experience.<p>The OP advice of not saying salary might be appropriate at other companies, I&#x27;m not privy to their compensation practices, but it is not correct at Automattic. A few folks in this thread suggested lying, which I would disagree with in any circumstance, much better not to answer -- lying in response to a factual question demonstrates low integrity and most employers, including us, would not want to work with that person.<p>Automattic is one of too few companies that tries to treat people who <i>live</i> in different countries the same, which is an important distinction from treating people who <i>are from</i> different countries and now live and work in the US the same, which of course every company is legally required to do (though there are still some serious issues around pay equality and even gender, to start). Many companies explicitly try to have offices and hire people in countries where the cost of living and wages are lower to save money; our thought is that the internet makes that obsolete and over time enlightened companies will pay people what they&#x27;re worth regardless of where they live.<p>There have been about 5 times someone hasn&#x27;t wanted to share, every time because they think making a low amount in the past (at a non-profit, in a country where wages are low) will lower their offer, which it doesn&#x27;t and I try to re-assure. One case comes to mind in 2012 of someone who had attended Stanford but moved back to India because didn&#x27;t have a visa, and was worried their geography would mean they were paid less, in which case I would have said to not worry about the fact that you&#x27;re in India because that doesn&#x27;t matter to Automattic -- if I gave the impression that it mattered whether you were Indian (or any other background) I apologize. We did end up hiring this person and at a similar salary to someone in the Bay Area doing a similar role, though there were some complications with them wanting to be paid to a US bank account, in USD (we try to pay people in the currency of where they live so they&#x27;re sheltered from forex shifts), and travel to work in the US, which our attorneys advised us would create issues in absence of a work visa, which the person didn&#x27;t have. They ended up only being with the company 9 months, the last few on a performance plan, but that was based on work after they had joined, not anything to do with the interview or compensation process, just sometimes there isn&#x27;t a mutual fit. (Over the past 10 years we&#x27;ve had about 60 people be let go or leave, it&#x27;s definitely not personal.)<p>Not sure if that was the same person as nodelessness, but if so I feel very bad you thought any of that had to do with you being Indian, and I&#x27;m happy to chat or discuss more to clear it up. I also hope the information and context above helps any one who is considering working at Automattic know that we&#x27;ll do our darndest to create a comfortable and fair environment for everyone.",1430591670

It certainly works like I describe at some companies.<p>> Hiring is complex, there are many legal implications of the interview process, I had to correct one of my employees just yesterday because he said the word &quot;young&quot;, this is a big no no in the UK, we can&#x27;t look for a &quot;young person&quot;. I had to clarify and expand that he meant this is an entry level position designed for people looking to get exposure to certain technologies in an environment that will foster their ambitions and provide opportunities for growth as we expand. Fun this stuff isn&#x27;t it, few developers want to learn these rules.<p>So your dev said something ageist and you taught them how to rebrand it? I&#x27;m really not seeing how this supports your point. If HR screening is just a way to cover your ass because your staff are bigots, I&#x27;m even more happy to be screened out by your HR department.<p>> As firms get larger, responsibilities get divided into lines that are more immutable, sadly this will mean the person doing the first stage of the hiring probably knows nothing about computer science, but may well have an excellent understanding of team psychology and HR laws.<p>What this boils down to is &quot;this is the way it&#x27;s done, so this is the way it should be done&quot;.<p>If you hired developers that embraced diversity in practice rather than in appearance, you wouldn&#x27;t have to have such an understanding of HR laws. It sounds like you&#x27;re so caught up in solving this legal problem that you don&#x27;t realize you have an <i>actual</i> problem.<p>To address your concern about demonstrating that you didn&#x27;t receive any transpeople&#x27;s applications: I&#x27;m not saying you shouldn&#x27;t keep records of who applies. I&#x27;m sure you can figure out a way to keep records of who applies without having HR decide which applicants are considered.<p>> When I read a comment like your last one, I find it slightly saddening, it reminds me of being in Hong Kong last month, a friend of mine wouldn&#x27;t even try the pickled ducks tongue, I&#x27;ve no idea why, he eats pate, but outright refused to even take a bite. I fear you are talking out of complete ignorance.<p>On the contrary, I&#x27;ve worked at firms like the ones you&#x27;ve described, and that&#x27;s exactly why I despise your way of thinking. I&#x27;ve experienced plenty of it and it&#x27;s toxic.<p>> There are some teams in the big corporate firms that I&#x27;d rather quit (and have done!) than join, but there are also ones where I&#x27;ve worked with some of the best developers, mathematicians and scientists I&#x27;ve ever met, that&#x27;s a fairly high bar. One in particular had a &#x27;cap&#x27; of £250k per year for a developer, to give you an idea the average price is £60k. This big finance firm realised the value the right developers have, the money was symbolic, we had budget for anything we could remotely justify (PCIe SSDs when they were unheard of etc) we had very good levels of autonomy too, with a relaxed working environment, even if other people on other floors were wearing suits. I&#x27;ve also worked for a &#x27;brogrammer startup&#x27; that I ended up quitting swiftly as they were breaking the law. I wouldn&#x27;t project my experiences out to the whole set, only keep in mind that there are interesting opportunities everywhere, understand their barriers and obviously tailor my CV to fit each application.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that there are great devs on dysfunctional teams. There are even non-dysfunctional teams at large firms (<p>> It is foolish to write them all off, and frankly portrays that element of dismissing something you don&#x27;t understand, which I find to be very poor trait for an engineer.<p>Why is it that you assume I don&#x27;t understand it?

Since YouTube isn&#x27;t in the same business as Netflix (VOD), it&#x27;s hard to use that as a cap on its valuation.)<p>The author&#x27;s valuation of YouTube today is probably still inflated by a large multiple.

The problem is too difficult to be solved even by automated static analysis, testing and fuzzing.<p>The reason those safe languages aren&#x27;t used pretty much always boils down to either a) legacy or b) performance. Rust solves the latter, but the former is nigh intractable.<p>Simply expecting programmers to be better or more careful is not a viable solution. The aviation industry knows this - problems can almost always be attributed to a systemic cause, not the one-off mistake of an individual. Problems are fixed by making those mistakes <i>impossible</i>, not by reminding people not to do that, crossing your fingers and hoping for the best.<p>This attitude is spreading to other industries - primarily healthcare[1].

One argument is that, often, the child may not be given a choice whether to be implanted. There are long-term considerations: the CI destroys any residual hearing and the capability for hearing aids to work so you can&#x27;t &quot;roll back&quot; after the surgery, you can&#x27;t do MRIs ever again, you are supposed to avoid high pressure/high impact activities (scuba diving, tackle football, etc) -- although many deaf people with CIs that disregard this advice. It&#x27;s also a big commitment that requires years of auditory training to master, especially if you received the implant after the language development phase of childhood -- maybe 5 or 6 years of age.<p>It does seem the CI&#x27;s effectiveness is inversely proportional to age of implantation, especially if you are going from zero hearing (with hearing aids) to a CI overnight. The younger you are, your brain has a chance to develop into the CI as it would with normal ears, and those kids are often functionally hearing. Which is totally fine with me, by the way.<p>Source: Deaf, use sign language, have a CI, although I don&#x27;t wear it anymore.

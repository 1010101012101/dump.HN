Usually trips around the Bay Area (it's amazing what's there within an hour's driving distance), dining, cooking (it's actually more expensive then dining out, but well worth it in terms of using exactly the ingredients that you want), movies.<p>Coding. Right now I am an airport (waiting for a flight) implementing something (a CS concept) I've implemented at work in Java, in OCaml just to refresh my knowledge of OCaml (and my understanding of what I actually did). I'll write toys just for fun of it, for myself. It's okay to re-invent the wheel if you have to, do it for enjoyment.<p>Reading. Can be technical, can be non-fiction, can be fiction. Presently I am reading Richard Rhodes' Dark Sun and Benjamin Pierce's Types and Programming Languages.<p>Keep in mind that your brain is a lot like a heap of a run-time with generational garbage collection or a log-structured file system / database. Occasionally, the throughput at which you can write and read information from it goes down as it moves the bytes around and deletes the un-needed stuff. If you never let it do that, you'll run out of space / your knowledge will become incredibly fragmented.<p>It's important that if <i>if you don't feel like being productive</i> (read: your NewGen is full) you <i>shouldn't force yourself to be</i>. Go for a walk, watch a movie, work out, go out and eat (even if by yourself). I wonder how much money companies lose due to the rule or convention that one should work in a single contiguous chunk during the day (sitting comatose at their screen, when they should be taking a nap or going on a walk).",1286150285

But don't I understand why the phrase ""fractional reserve banking"" is used to describe the problem.<p>The term ""fractional reserve"" refers to what percent of total deposits the bank is required by the government to keep on hand.  0% reserve banking is not less risky than fractional reserve.  And 100% reserve banking is clearly just putting paper in a vault so you're renting vault space in such a system.<p>So maybe people should stop using this term when they complain about banking.  Their real problem is with government insurance and demand deposits.<p>The speaker asserts that this system could not exist without the FDIC but clearly it did exist before the FDIC.<p>I'm against government insurance too, but these kinds of unsubstantiated statements provide people with reasons to dismiss the sound things being said.",1286150198

If you decide to go into one of these areas, you can learn this later.<p>- More advanced books on linear algebra usually emphasize the abstract study of vector spaces and linear transformations. This is fine, but you also need to learn about matrix algebra (some of which is in that Horn & Johnson book) and basic matrix calculus, since in statistics, you'll frequently be manipulating matrix equations. The vector space stuff generally does not help with this, and this material isn't in standard linear algebra books. (Similarly, you should learn the basics of numerical linear algebra and optimization -- convex optimization in particular shows up a lot in statistics.)<p>- People have different opinions on books like Rudin, but you need to learn to read material like this if you're going into an area like probability. It's also more or less a de facto standard, so it is worth reading partly for that reason as well. So read Rudin/Royden (or equivalent, there are a small handful of others), but supplement them with other books if you need (e.g. 'The Way of Analysis' is the complete opposite of Rudin in writing style). It helps to read a few different books on the same topic simultaneously, anyway.<p>- Two books on measure-theoretic probability theory that are more readable than many of the usual suspects are ""Probability with Martingales"" by Williams and ""A User's Guide to Measure-Theoretic Probability"" by Pollard. There is also a nice book called ""Probability through Problems"" that develops the theory through a series of exercises.",1286149829

The whole point of the program was to provide income for old people the last few years of their lives, not to allow them to live for 30 years after retirement.<p>On your last point, you're simply making that up.  Assuming you live long enough to reach retirement age, you will get benefits.  The idea that you won't get benefits is based on absurd projections that wrongly assume the retirement age will never change.  That's simply not going to happen, benefits/age will simply be adjusted to compensate and keep the program for those within a few years of the average lifespan, as it was intended.<p>You've fallen for political scare tactics of those opposed to the very idea of social security because they're opposed to all government assistance and anything even slightly socialist.  Benefits simply have to be adjusted so payouts don't exceed payins and we're not using debt to support people.  For the boomer generation, that sucks, because they're huge and gen X isn't.

1753984,comment,1753711,1753711,0,0,lukesandberg,,,"One of the reasons TI calculators are so popular in schools is because TI works a lot with textbook producers.  I worked for a company developing math books for a large publisher and we had a lot of contact with TI.  they gave us tons of calculators, gave us pre-releases of new calculators and various other accessories.  Thus we wrote our textbook targeting the TI calculators.  This is why many textbooks come with TI specific instructions and come with software that only works with TI calculators.<p>This is probably the reason that many schools mandate these calculators, they're written into the curriculum by default.  so it only natural to require them.",1286148686

Now web applications are becoming extremely popular, but they are still held back. If I wanted to make open source graphing software, I would be an idiot to design it as a web application. Nobody wants to pay to run a public server and users don't like typing in 127.0.0.1:8000 if it is run locally.<p>I think that web browsers could address this issue by creating a button to list local web apps (they would be more than extensions). These apps could simply register themselves in a text file (and the browser would ask the user to authorize these 'installs'). Think of all the great open source software that would go from depending on different platform APIs to simply writing javascript/html/css and letting the browser become the potential crux we know it can be.<p>I am a bit of a lurker here (this is a temp account), and I know this idea is probably phrased horribly, but I just thought I'd throw it out there.

All foreign income not repatriated to singapore (i.e, it goes in a bank account in HK instead of singapore) is tax free.  Panama corporations do have any tax in all income not derived from Panama. Labuan (in Malaysia) has an other low tax structure.<p>To avoid UK (and Canadian) residents doing a run around on their tax system with these corporations, any corporation who's 'top management' is majority run by residents in the UK (or in the UK) is taxed as if it is a UK corporation.  Since your going to be away from the UK, you can remove your UK resident status (you have to do this properly, they can get you with things like still being registered to the NHS or having a residence in the UK still that isn't purely investment property, etc, etc).  Once you loose your UK residence (you still stay as a UK citizen forever, your just not resident) your corporation will not have that tax status in the UK, and you do not have to pay taxes to the UK for your worldwide personal income.  I don't know how it works when you move around in the EU, it can be different.<p>You can then travel the world as a resident of nowhere and be mostly tax free, with the majority of your income staying in your corporation, and drawing a living expenses income from the corporation.  How you want to structure that income (being a corporate expense or personal income), and report it to the country your currently in depends on you and what your doing.  It being an online business of you and your laptop, practically you'll not get any problems from working online on whatever tourist visa your using, since it's virtually undetectable and you don't really have to interact with their economy locally.  Especially if it is only for one or two visa stays and a developing country.  How you deal with that is up to you.<p>If you are going to plan which countries your going to, getting a tourist visa before you leave at an embassy in the UK will be useful, since you can get extra long visa stays vs the stamps you get arriving in the airport.  For example you could get a triple entry tourist visa from thailand for free which would get you 3x2month stays in thailand.  Your not going to get that from a embassy anywhere near thailand, but somewhere far like the UK would be a lot more likely.<p>For health insurance you can try to get an annual international travel insurance policy if you want to be covered.<p>I am not a lawyer and you should do your own research, but I hope this helps.",1286147194

Redis in memory data structures take up to 10x as much space as the on disk structures, so writing them to disk verbatim wastes a lot of bandwidth.<p>So apparently using memory mapped files wouldn't work for Redis. But what if you used data structures that do have good locality and are optimized for space usage? Has this been tried? I think it is an interesting approach and has the potential to outperform Redis' approach, especially for bigger databases. If your data structures use say 2x as much space as Redis' on disk structures, then you would still be able to fit much more data in memory than Redis because you don't lose half your memory as described in the OP, plus the data structures are more compact.",1286147013

Evidently, a bass was reported as stolen, and a complete description of the instrument was provided to police. Surveillance footage showed him leaving the conservatory carrying a bass, and that was sufficient to obtain a search warrant for his home. Never mind that he&#x27;s a bassist, and the footage showed him carrying his own instrument. There can clearly be only one bass in existence, and the one on the surveillance tape must be it.<p>Upon searching his apartment, the police found not one, but <i>two</i> double basses in his possession. Never mind that he had documentation to show that they both belonged to him, and never mind that neither one fit the description of the instrument that had been stolen. There can clearly be only one bass in existence, and these ... two ... basses, somehow, are ... it? I dunno, these aren&#x27;t the same maker, and they don&#x27;t have the same identifying marks, but hey, they have four strings! The one that&#x27;s missing has four strings! Good enough, he must have just hidden the stolen bass under a rug or something. (They&#x27;re easy to hide, right?) Let&#x27;s just make an arrest and go home.<p>So they arrested him, and (again, despite having conclusive proof that neither was the instrument in question) seized both basses, along with his cell phone, and held him on $100,000 bail.<p>Astonishingly, charges were ultimately dropped for lack of evidence.<p>This was in San Francisco -- about as un-podunk, un-middle-America, and un-Republican as you can get without showing a passport. Lazy police work is everywhere. It has nothing to do with politics or ignorance, and it doesn&#x27;t really even have to do particularly with the war on drugs (although that certainly gives the police more opportunities to brandish their laziness publicly).

Just to clarify, I didn&#x27;t say the Democrat party was the only one perpetuating the notion of victimhood.  Other organizations do as well, but the Democrat party are the biggest, in my opinion.  Here&#x27;s why I feel that way:<p>The Democrats like to hoist around this big banner of Civil Rights and claim that it was them who brought equality to America in 1964, but this is a lie.  The Democrats set civil rights back by almost 100 years.  During the Reconstruction era, it was Republicans (Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner, in particular) who steamrolled Democrat president Andrew Johnson and got huge civil rights bills and the 14th Amendment passed over Johnson&#x27;s veto.  These Republicans granted the freedmen citizenship and the right to vote, much to the chagrin of the Democratic party.  They also outlawed segregation, made it illegal to deny public services and amenities to the freedmen, and attempted to pay restitution to the freedmen in the form of 40 acres of land and enough money to build a house.  The Democrats blocked that from happening though.  Basically, the freed slaves were given every civil right that black people enjoy today back in the 1800s, but when the Republicans lost power in Congress, the Democrats took it all away.<p>Some like to distance themselves from this history and claim that during the early 20th Century that the Democrats and Republicans switched roles, but this is also an attempt to rewrite the facts.  In truth, Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, did sign the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but the Democrats didn&#x27;t want it, and it was only because of the Republicans in Congress that the act passed and became law.  Ever since then, especially right before an election, you&#x27;ll notice that it is the Democrats who race-bait and try to get everyone all stirred up again.  It is Democrats who preach the false narrative that Republicans hate black people.  In other words, they are using, as they always have, racial prejudices, or at least the illusion of such, to get votes.  I was born in the 1960s, and I&#x27;ve seen a lot of Democrat candidates promise the moon to black voters, but I&#x27;ve never really seen them deliver.  The state of equality between blacks and whites has largely gone unchanged.  In my opinion, The Democrat party uses and abuses black people to get power.<p>Please don&#x27;t misunderstand.  I know that Republicans have screwed things up too, and I know that there are segments of the nation where racial prejudices are still thriving.  I&#x27;m simply giving my reasoning for calling out the Democrat party in my original post.  If you&#x27;d like to discuss that further, or point out where I&#x27;m wrong, I&#x27;d be happy to have that discussion.  The entire purpose of my original post was to open up a dialogue and offer some things to think about.",1451378624

It would be an instance of the logical fallacy Argument to Moderation (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderation</a>). You frame the &quot;race problem in America&quot; as a problem &quot;with the culture and values of both white people and black people&quot; as if some intrinsic qualities of white and black cultures lead them to conflict. Does some cultural trait lead black people to subject themselves to ongoing discrimination in every step of the justice system. Does some value held sacred by white Americans lead them to segregate their children from those of blacks?<p>The problem of race in America is not symmetrical. The relationship between whites and blacks is not like that of rival nations who might simply set aside their differences and compromise. Blacks are literally victims of hundreds of years of white oppression, oppression which continues to this day in subtle but pervasive forms. Witness, for example, the failure to indict Tamir Rice&#x27;s killer, today.<p>Systematic housing and banking discrimination throughout most of the last hundred years has held back blacks as white families accumulated wealth through the remarkably effective mechanism of home ownership. Relegated to inner-city ghettoes,  black children today attend schools funded by property taxes levied on crumbling infrastructure, while their white counterparts enjoy educations funded by the largesse of wealthy suburbs.<p>The wealth disparity means that black parents must spend more energy just to provide the essentials, and cannot provide the same guidance and resources to their children that their white counterparts take for granted.<p>A justice system stacked against the poor further exasperates these economic injustices, and racist laws, policies, police, and administrators conspire to incarcerate black men far out of proportion to their culpability for crimes. As a result, black children too often lack the support of fathers altogether.<p>Acknowledging these grievances to blacks does not do blacks any disservice, as if they are inherently lazy, shiftless people looking for an excuse to give up. But to deny these inequities is to deny struggling blacks the respect their efforts deserve. The deck is stacked against them, making every achievement that much more impressive.<p>If we must reduce the issue to two sides, the other side is simply white indifference. It is not a malicious hateful racism, which exists but only in the margins of society. The other side of the race coin is just blissful white ignorance and indifference, such as showcased in this thread.<p>What folly it is to self-righteously exhort the oppressed to stop making excuses and meet their oppressors half-way! The way forward is to overcome the unending indifference and bottomless ignorance of far too many whites. The impetus is on us as whites to make reparations, to make blacks whole to whatever extent possible, and to ensure, if nothing else, that blacks enjoy full equality of justice and opportunity going forward.",1451378268

However, canning the H1-B program is only one way to reduce supply.

I think the sentiment that he&#x27;s a perma-bear that just happened to get lucky is very unlikely. First, Michael Burry manufactured the credit swap trade that he is known for. What I mean by that is that Burry didn&#x27;t trade options regularly. Rather, somewhat like Elon Musk, he reasoned from first principles. Burry started from the fact that certain housing markets were deteriorating and loan standards had been massively relaxed. Then figured out exactly what loans were in which CDO&#x27;s and which tranches would be impacted by bad loans. Then he went out and bought credit default swaps against those specific tranches. There was very little luck involved.<p>In addition to that, prior to the credit default swaps trade, Burry had been running Scion very successfully using a value strategy (wikipedia quotes Michael Lewis as follows <i>in his first full year, 2001, the S&P 500 fell 11.88 percent. Scion was up 55 percent. The next year, the S&P 500 fell again, by 22.1 percent, and yet Scion was up again: 16 percent. The next year, 2003, the stock market finally turned around and rose 28.69 percent, but Mike Burry beat it again—his investments rose by 50 percent.</i> That is amazing performance.<p>Burry really is worth listening to. I went back and read his Scion Capital letters and IMO he actually is a genius wrt investing. I don&#x27;t know quite how to express it other than its got the same feel as Warren Buffett&#x27;s letters. He doesn&#x27;t get swayed by fear or greed, he&#x27;s just incredibly logical.",1451376298

There is no algorithm that would not get developed, no software that would not get written, if there was a lack of patent protection.  I cannot imagine any person or company choosing <i>not</i> to build something simply because they it could not be patented and therefore could be &quot;stolen&quot;.<p>So from that perspective, at the very least software patents are unnecessary and provide no real benefit in terms of providing an incentive to innovate.  Maybe that&#x27;s a &quot;tough claim&quot; as well, but that&#x27;s just the way I see it from both personal experience and from watching the industry in general, and, frankly, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;d take some pretty strong evidence to convince me otherwise.<p>So if we -- bear with me on this -- take that as correct, then it becomes pretty brain-dead simple to assert that software patents are a huge net negative on innovation, creating a drain on time, brainpower, and money, to name a few things.<p>I&#x27;ve been on the receiving end of a patent-troll suit, and it was a huge waste of time for me (and my colleagues), as well as a huge waste of money for my company to pay for lawyers to deal with and settle the matter.  And for what?  Some greedy rent-seeking bastards to line their pockets for doing nothing that benefits anyone but them.",1451376227

Why eschew &quot;white priviledge,&quot; then turn around and say, &quot;The only way you can succeed is if we, the majority, give you success?&quot; It is a lie!</i><p>I don&#x27;t think people have been saying &quot;The only way you can succeed is if we, the majority, give you success&quot; at all, certainly not the &quot;only&quot; part.  Of course people know that success is possible without it, and inferring that the other side said that is very dishonest.  Getting help is not dehumanizing at all, unlike what you say.  I have seen various alterations of this sentiment spruiked by politicians to remove aid from people.  I am pretty sure that the people receiving aid would not say that it dehumanizes them.<p>Disadvantage and advantage is compounding in almost all real life areas (social competence being a stand out one), which is why people worry about schooling for their young children and other such things that may give them advantage from a young age.  The correct sort of aid could have a very large positive effect over time, unlike not giving aid.",1451376116

So I didn&#x27;t play with a DSP. However, in lab 6 you program a driver for an ethernet controller which I suspect must be similar to programming a sound card. Typically, you put your data somewhere in the memory, and then you give the address to the controller and launch some operation that the controller will do for you do for you (fetching your data using DMA).

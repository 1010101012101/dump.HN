Except of course tagging commits with branches is not unnecessary, because that's the only way a user might make sense of ancestors of a merge commit...<p>Unless you like manually tracking parents of a commit, and trying to guess which branch is which based on commit messages. Fun!<p>I've seen many workarounds to this clear deficiency, the simplest of which is simply putting the branch name at the start of the commit title. Of course that usually cuts the space available for the <i>actual</i> commit title down from ~60 characters to 20-40, depending on how verbosely you call your branches.",1365454785

This option can dramatically reduce the time to restore a large database to a server running on a multi-processor machine.<p>Each job is one process or one thread, depending on the operating system, and uses a separate connection to the server.<p>The optimal value for this option depends on the hardware setup of the server, of the client, and of the network. Factors include the number of CPU cores and the disk setup. A good place to start is the number of CPU cores on the server, but values larger than that can also lead to faster restore times in many cases. Of course, values that are too high will lead to decreasing performance because of thrashing.<p>Only the custom archive format is supported with this option. The input file must be a regular file (not, for example, a pipe). This option is ignored when emitting a script rather than connecting directly to a database server.

Even PBS has about 10 minutes of ads and ""sponsorship ads"" per hour.<p>My superficial opinion is BBC shows transmit at an IQ around 100 or local population average, compared to USA TV around an IQ of 60 or so.  I believe this discrepancy is demanded by advertisers wanting the eyeballs to be more gullible, a more easily duped audience.  So aside from imports being ""too long"" for US viewers, imports assume the viewers actually graduated high school, etc, which is another impedance mismatch.  Its hilarious comparing shows that jumped the pond, like scrapheap challenge/junkyard wars.

Using a DSL like XSLT for XML transformation is a <i>lot</i> more productive than in Java.<p>""Quite simply, each language is good for its specific task, but can't (easily) do anything else.""<p>Correct, let XSLT do what XSLT does (transform XML), and fill in the rest with Java.  I've been paying attention to XProc for a long time and seems to be good fit for what <i>it</i> does, (manage series of XML transformations).<p>""All I need to do is use that XSLT directory listing function... that function that doesn't exist.""<p>Well, that's true.  I'm surprised that somebody extolling the virtues of Haskell would miss this point, but XSLT is supposed to be a pure-functional language.  You should't make side-effect/non-deterministic calls during a transformation.  Furthermore, since he discovered the ability to write to multiple output documents in XSLT 2.0, I'm surprised that he didn't think of multiple <i>input</i> documents.<p>The answer here would be to use java to produce all of the necessary input before the xslt/xproc pipeline.  Create a temporary DOM filled with just a directory listing, you can configure Saxon to select on arbitrary documents that you create, and do it all in memory.  Xproc is meant to make transformations composable in case you don't explicitly know everything beforehand, like if there's dynamically generated file content that gets populated from earlier transformations, but I think it's less useful than XSLT.<p>""Contrast this with the DOM model from Java.""<p>Well, an API discussion on Java/DOM is a different matter entirely.<p>""Ant and XSLT are not designed for modularity.""<p>Yes, they are.  They are modular with respect to their domain models.<p>If the point was ""Well, a client mandated the use of Java, but it wasn't so bad because I was able to do everything in XSLT and XPROC"", it would have been interesting.  Furthermore, one might have said, ""If XSLT was a DSL written as an embedded API in a friendly language with extensible syntax like haskell, ruby or scala, it would have cut out the middle man"".<p>To claim, however, that languages that aren't general purpose are dangerous becuase, well, they aren't general, is bit of a stretch.",1365454212

So you're most likely to see the phase transition begin when an existing network is almost about to go bankrupt so there's not as much to loose, or perhaps right after a bankruptcy.

It's already <i>extremely expensive</i> to hire someone on an H1B visa, despite what myths may have been spread, due to legal and logistical expenses.<p>There is an abuse I have however heard of (sorry no citation): obtaining H1B visas for employees you never intend to bring to the US. This is due to how difficult it is to get work visas to the US, so you end up with an H1B ""just in case"" you need them to travel.<p>The right to switch jobs is another tricky one. The remit of an H1B is to place a foreign worker in a <i>job role</i> which has been demonstrated to be difficult to fill with a citizen. It does not replace an individual <i>job</i>. You can switch jobs with an H1B so long as the other job is the same job role (very much the same job responsibilities). This seems ok to begin with, but after several years it turns into a shackle because it's difficult for H1B workers, who by their nature are specialists, to switch to another job with the same specialist role. Combine that with the huge amount of time it can take to convert to a green card (5-10 years for some countries), and they're stuck in a job for most of a decade in an era where job hopping is common.",1365453731

That immediately ensures that (a) H1B's are used for all professions where high skills are needed, without a need to enumerate them in laws; and (b) H1B's are used to import skills instead of cheap labor, as for less-skilled jobs it would be cheaper to hire locally.",1365453729

It seems the target market of this app is geared towards Web->iOS devs, but that seems like a smaller slice than something like ""Bootstrap for iOS"" should be made to do. Bootstrap is great because it makes web development so much easier through native uses. It doesn't add another language paradigm to make web development easier - it does it inherently.<p>1) If you're gonna' call it ""Bootstrap for iOS"", have the analogy end there. The site is way, way, way too much like Bootstrap already. Brand it better.<p>2) Good native code should be inherent! Nobody should have to learn CSS to make better iOS apps! A beginner should have a framework for her/him that allows something easy like [view fadeIn] and it work. Then, if they want a little more control something like [view fadeInOverTime:seconds]. Adding a shadow should be as easy as [view addShadow] or [view addShadowWithCornerRadius:radius]. Rounding corners is already extremely easy using QuartzCore, but let's make it even more intuitive for people. [view roundCorners] and then [view roundCornersWithRadius:radius]. The whole point is to make development exponentially easier for anybody to come in and start making useful, beautiful things.<p>I'm working on a class to include that does all of point #2 plus a ton more - and seeing this post will probably be the catalyst to releasing it this weekend. I have a huge plan in the works for making extremely easy to use UI elements as well, but I think open sourcing this in chunks, then releasing the whole thing as an example on how they all work together is gonna' be the route I go.

Well, at <i>some</i> point people will decide that the price is ridiculous, because it's all based on speculation -- suppose it's $10,000 / bitcoin.

Her delivery was stilted, probably because she was either very nervous and/or hadn't practiced her presentation nearly often enough to sound natural.  On top of that, the talk was way too long.  It could have been easily cut in half, at the very least.<p>In a Boing Boing article[1] (which also, incidentally, calls her presentation a ""tour-de-force""), her points were summarized in these quotes:<p><pre><code>  Hard-to-parse protocols require complex parsers. Complex, buggy\n  parsers become weird machines for exploits to run on. Help stop weird\n  machines today: Make your protocol context-free or regular!\n\n  Protocols and file formats that are Turing-complete input languages\n  are the worst offenders, because for them, recognizing valid or\n  expected inputs is UNDECIDABLE: no amount of programming or testing\n  will get it right.\n\n  A Turing-complete input language destroys security for generations of\n  users.  Avoid Turing-complete input languages!\n</code></pre>\nOk.  I got that.  Seems reasonable enough.  It didn't take me 40 minutes read that, and it shouldn't take 40 minutes to present basically the same thing.  Maybe half that if you thought you really had to fight hard to make your case.<p>A more concise presentation containing just the important/interesting bits would have been less painful to watch and probably a lot easier to prepare for.<p>That said, the Q&A period at the end was good.  She seemed a lot more comfortable there, and there was a lot more interesting and informative content there than in the presentation proper.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://boingboing.net/2011/12/28/linguistics-turing-completene.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boingboing.net/2011/12/28/linguistics-turing-complete...</a>",1365453307

5514370,comment,5513031,5513031,2,0,Kapura,,,"The fundamental flaw is not with bitcoin, but with people. At the beginning of march, I told all of my friends that Bitcoin was worth more than it was selling for, for many of the reasons listed in the post. It's essentially inflation proof; supply of bitcoin is not going to outstrip demand. I reasoned, then, that long term, the value is likely to go up. This is great if you're planning on spending any bitcoins as currency on silkroad or any of the numerous other websites that now accept some sort of payment in bitcoin: if you know you're going to want to buy in the future, it makes sense (generally) to buy into them now. This creates a broader base of unique users, giving more validity to the currency.<p>However, people see that the value of something is going up, they think ""IT WILL ONLY GO UP"" and then buy them with no intent to use them for a 'real' transaction. That's the problem identified in the post. But hey, guess what: Bubbles pop. At some point, the value of bitcoin will drop, and many of these speculators will sell off. This will devalue the currency for the people who wanted to use it for legitimate transactions, but sometimes you bite the bear, and sometimes the bear bites you.<p>The important thing to remember is that this currency is not inherently worthless. The housing bubble was catalysed by complex financial packages that disguised the fact that they were garbage assets. The Dutch tulip craze[1] was about fucking flowers. They were being purchased by people who had no desire to plant and grow the flowers. But Bitcoin is different. As long as people will still accept and trade in bitcoin, Bitcoin will never be as susceptible to collapse as other historical bubbles.<p>Further, with bitcoin, all news is good news. Any press that gets more people interested in bitcoin is good for the bitcoin economy in general. There will, of course, be some speculators who jump on hoping for a big payout. But there will be some people who look and see the inherent value of a decentralised currency and begin to accept bitcoin.<p>A lot of people can peg their bitcoin prices to more stable currencies: 4chan pass sells for $20 usd, but you can pay in bitcoin. I'm under the impression that Silkroad vendors do something similar. This means that, regardless of the current price of bitcoin, it's still useful for its intended goal.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania</a>",1365453196

I believe that, there is potential for the Bitcoin economy to run into the problem of a limited money supply & the Bitcoin-hoarding because; there will not be enough currency. Since a long-run inelastic and fixed supply currency is not useful for a real world economy, the result will be a recession and due to the limited money supply it will evolve into a depression.

The ubiquity and deployability seem to me to be largely due to the internet which is one of the comments that Kay makes.  People confuse the workings of the internet with the workings of the web.  Right now we send documents that are interpreted, but there is nothing to say we can't send objects which are ""interpreted"" (or JITed more likely).

You can already see the complexity of things like javascript and css increasing as the web attempts to offer applications, not just documents, and doing this by having a committee standardize high-level behaviour like layout seems to be a poor approach in the long run.<p>Most of the talk is focused on thinking in the long-term as well as working to decrease the complexity of the software edifices we are currently creating, before they become too large to improve in any revolutionary way.<p>Who knows, maybe the next web will be built on top of the web, the way the web was built on top of the internet.

5514286,comment,5513545,5513962,9,0,jonnathanson,,,"Mostly correct, but what's at stake here isn't the cable fees so much as the local/affiliate fees. Those are still a decent business for companies like NewsCorp (and others), but let's face it: local affiliate television is dying on the vine, one way or the other. It faces a fundamental challenge much more significant than the one posed by Aereo.<p>The entire premise behind affiliate television is that local station owners can license the rights to national programming, and then exercise a quasi-monopoly over distribution of that content to local markets. (If I'm the FOX affiliate in NYC, for instance, I pay FOX for the rights to its shows, and I have exclusive rights to air those shows in NYC).<p>This business model was threatened the minute the internet took hold, really, because the very idea of local exclusivity is anachronistic now. It's one of the two horse-and-buggy concepts of the 21st century content distribution business (the other being time-bound content viewership). It is threatened much more extensively by Netflix, by YouTube, by Hulu, by Microsoft, by iTunes, etc., than by any one startup. It is threatened by virtue of its irrelevancy in the modern, globally connected era.<p>The idea of moving television networks to paid subscription models has been bandied about for at least a decade now. IIRC, it was NBC who first proposed this idea in the early 2000s. Indeed, this may come to pass at some point: not because of the likes of Aereo, but because broadcast television starts to make less and less business sense as time goes on (whereas content ownership and distributorship is still viable). Eventually, we'll probably have nothing <i>but</i> content shops, who distribute their wares across all channels -- perhaps offering different tiers of the products at different prices in different channels, and/or extracting licensing fees to different distributors.<p>As a consumer, expect a generally upward trend in content pricing in the long run (i.e., free to paid). It'll just depend on <i>whom</i> you're paying. Advertising-subsizided, free content will still exist to the extent that distribution channels like YouTube continue to thrive.",1365452453

As part of the attempt to rebuild the country a consensus was formed that the British state would step in and help people - hence the NHS, hence free school milk (as rickets was a very common disease). The unions had too much power for much of that time, but British industry also had terrible management practices so I would put both ""sides"" as bad as each other.<p>But while Thatcher shook things up and modernised many parts of the economy, she did it in an extremely divisive and many would say callous way - by devastating communities (especially in the north of England), destroying British manufacturing and putting unemployment up to 3 million (with millions more on disability, to make the jobless figures look better).<p>And these are legacies that still live on today - where I grew up there are still houses with barbed wire between neighbours who have lived there for years - as a result of the miner's strike. The north is still significantly poorer than the south, with much higher unemployment. The current government has just pushed through an extremely painful reform of disability allowance that appears to be punishing the genuinely disabled as much as the ""skivers"". And in Scotland she is so despised that you can't even say her name in public after shutting down much of the country's industry and taking North Sea oil revenue down south.<p>For the most part, nowadays, the question isn't whether the reforms were needed, but whether they had to be done so painfully and whether the benefits of those reforms were shared fairly.

Currently, Bitcoin can be considered elastic (to some extent) although it’s subject to future diminishing elasticity meaning that, in the long run there will be a finite supply of Bitcoins and an inelastic supply (after all there are only 21M of them).<p>However, a long-run inelastic and fixed supply currency is not useful for a real world economy because, currencies are supposed to be used as a medium of exchange to facilitate transactions which, allows the multiplier effect kick in and increase the economies wealth. Whereas due to the deflationary spiral you're incentivised to hoard Bitcoins & let them appreciate in value instead which is the opposite effect of what a currency is meant to do.",1365452408

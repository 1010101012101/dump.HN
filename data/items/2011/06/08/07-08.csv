The first two are unrelated to dynamic/static typing, the latter is incorrect or badly phrased. You don't get ""type independence"" in dynamic typed languages, the types are still there.\nThirdly, he greatly exagerates the complexity of templates (thousands of incorrect syntax options for smart pointers, all you have is a hammer, etc)<p>It's a classic case of fishing for arguments to support an idea.",1307517315

Very often, beyond basic principles, what we are being taught in school is failing us in real life by being too general, too generic, and too broad to solve the problems we face. Given this, and given the lengths to which one must dig by oneself to solve a problem, a self reflecting geek tends to look back and see that his education has not been of much help. This is more so among information technology professionals and maybe among some in fundamental research.<p>This doesn't make education unnecessary, just that there needs to be a way of making it more relevant to people, problems and choices.",1307517116

They are, without discussion, the experts on their own software.<p>Nobody in the course got to 'hello world' before 2PM, the instructors constantly bickered between each other what tools the students should be using, and further discussion was limited to 'check our kitchen sink app for more demo code'. Everyone on the course<p>This is because having knowledge of a topic, and being able to teach others, are separate skills. Both are required, however academics - people who spend their live in academia and are used to learning things for the purpose of learning, whereas most others are goal oriented - tend to lack the latter skill, despite their expertise in the former.<p>This is not anti intellectualism.

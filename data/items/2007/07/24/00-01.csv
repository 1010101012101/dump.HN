A couple I would like to address.<p>""god damn, that guy has a lot of pictures of himself in that article""<p>Yes, yes I do.  Read my blog and you'll discover that I'm a <i>total</i> narcissist.  It's all part of the blog theme.<p>""Is this really true, when you take into account startups that fight tooth and nail and still don't succeed? Is it better to start with the confidence, money, and connections of other people and then ride the wave of their support, or is it better to start with nothing other than your own belief in yourself and then fight tooth and nail until you get the confidence, money, and connections of others?""<p>Good point.  My point then is that you need all of the above.  If you have connections, capital and a good idea - then sorry, you're a carbon copy of thousands of other tech entrepreneurs.  What separates you from them?  Anyone can always get more capital if you poke around a bit.  Anyone can get more connections if you spend more time schmoozing.  What you can't simply ""get"" is an emotional attachment to whatever you are doing.  That's something that has to be there from the beginning, I think.  That is what I learned from this experience.<p>""Problem 1: trying to build 3 apps while doing consulting work (no focus)""<p>Definitely.  I absolutely agree.  However, we were in no position to argue (much) and as I said in the post, the relationship we had with the supposed investor was flawed.<p>""Problem 2: the author was a dick to his only employee (wtf? why?)""<p>Ken wasn't an employee.  He was being paid the same as me and provided similar functions, although I naturally took on more of a leadership role, being the more experienced.  I'm a dick anyway, but yes, I was hard on Ken because I expected him to help me as much as possible not to fuck up the opportunity I thought we had.  But when you are ready to launch and you find that there are lots of basic errors in the HTML or front end code because advice you've given over and over hasn't been taken in, it's hard to remain cool and collected, especially if it's with a mate.<p>If anything, being in that situation taught me that I am not fit to be a boss and not fit to team lead.  I am much better working alone, and my individual work speaks for itself.  That is why I am now leaning towards solo consulting as the focus of my career.\n",1185237204

I feel like ---especially here at YC news--- the attitude is always ""charge full strength ahead! Work 80 hours a week and just release something as soon as possible!""<p>The problem with this tactic is that when you need reserves  to seize some unforeseen opportunity, you don't have any. For a startup, ""reserves"" could be something as simple as extra cash, employees not already committed to an 80 hour crunch, or your own health and morale.",1185237041

36229,comment,36117,36117,0,0,bcater,,,"I once worked on a small software project with two other people, and because the requirements and restrictions were so rigid, we didn't have to do much more than work out a UI - the system itself was pretty straightforward to implement. Thus, we figured out what each of us had done before or had a good working knowledge of and started coding. <p>Currently, I'm working on a much larger project with one other person. Our strategy so far is to try something, figure out why it didn't work, and then try something different. It reminds me of what one of my former math teachers told me: ""Whatever you do, don't just stare at the problem. Do something, even if you know it's wrong.""",1185235701
36228,comment,36197,36197,0,0,ed,,,"I'm reposting my argument from the blog comments:<p><p>""Given the screenshot you posted, I wouldn't really buy into your conclusions because you never really adjusted your designs to fit the varying widths. I think I can agree that have a landing page take up 100% of the available width is a bad thing, but it's not because the user is spending time turning their head to read content (that's a pretty poor argument); rather it's because users like to see visual boundaries -- where the content of the site begins and ends. Your widened versions appear to do a poor job of managing the space and as a result look more amateur than the thinner, more condensed versions. There are multiple problems that I can spot right away with your widescreen version -- for example, the user preferred width of a column of text is 3.5"", and the right-hand utilities section of the header appears to be disconnected from the rest of the page. Problems such as those, stemming from the design of the page (independent of its width) are probably more than enough to explain the difference in bounce rates.<p>""Furthermore, are you arguing that the decision made by CNN, Digg, CNet (et al.) to switch to a native 1024x768 design was wrong? I think the conservative argument you make in your post is quite backward -- online store owners would do better to expand their site designs and provide an enhanced experience for customers.""",1185235586

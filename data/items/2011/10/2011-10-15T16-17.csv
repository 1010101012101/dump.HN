I would rather have someone make sure (for free) that the app that I download isn't buggy, or crash-y, or other stuff. In practice, I've never missed something on the App Store (iPad 2 that I bought a few months ago) although I miss a lot of stuff on the Android Market (Nexus One that I own since a few years now). I got an Android before I got an iOS device going by such arguments from the couch. But I'm glad I can choose my phone, and it's going to be iPhone 4S when it launches here.

3115138,comment,3114977,3114977,7,0,swombat,,,"To me, the main shortcomings, at the moment, as a UK customer, are the male voice (seriously... I want the nicer american female voice... it subconsciously annoys me to think of ""Siri"" as a British male) and, perhaps more importantly, the fact that Siri won't connect to Yell/GMaps/etc in the UK yet, so I can't emerge out of the tube and ask ""How do I get to 123 Some Street?"" and be presented with a map. I'm not quite sure why that doesn't work in the UK - surely, the interfaces to Google Maps and even Yell don't differ by country.<p>Despite those, it is already very useful. I'm using the timer all the time (""Set a timer for 3 minutes"", ""Wake me up in 20 minutes"", ""Wake me up at 7am tomorrow""), and the weather (""What's the weather like tomorrow?""), and using it to set meetings (""Add event 'drinks with Enrico' at 6pm on Friday"").<p>The real killer, imho, will be the integration with services. The voice recognition seems good enough, the ""parsing what you mean"" could be improved but is good enough. What makes or breaks Siri is the integration with services. The timer/reminders/calendar integration is extremely smooth and so it is great and a huge help. Bits that aren't integrated (e.g. Twitter) or less well integrated (e.g. sending SMS's), less so.<p>All in all, a great start, and useful from day one, though, like all new Apple products, there's plenty of room for improvement. I'm waiting to see where they take it - unlike some other companies, Apple do have a reputation for relentlessly pushing forward after releasing an initial, ""it doesn't do much but it does it well"" device.",1318697320

If it is already much better than using the normal touch interface in many cases, the technology will evolve a lot in some way.

Next phone you buy you'll not care if it has or not that feature (unless somebody else or newer iPhones will be able to improve it a lot), and the technology will hardly evolve.<p>I don't still know as I don't have an iPhone 4s, and stories  I read still can't tell me if it is going to be used a lot or not.

Minimise that crap, get it off your plate entirely if possible.  These people would never consider a book that they wrote or an app that they made as being real income, even if it eclipsed their other income, because it was fundamentally done out of a sense of fun rather than work.<p>If you don't think of work in those terms, your argument is true.

Saving 80% would mean saving $80,000 per year, and living on $20,000 per year.  After 5 years you would have saved $400,000.  3% of $400,000 is $12,000, which is only about half of what you need to equal what you'd lived on for the past 5 years.  You'd need a 5% return in order to make $20,000 per year from $400,000.<p>And this doesn't even take taxes in to account.  Good luck saving 80% of your net when taxes alone eat away more than 20% of your net.  You're also going to wind up paying taxes on the 5% return, effectively requiring maybe a 6% return (or probably significantly more, considering how much you lost in income taxes in the first place).",1318695915

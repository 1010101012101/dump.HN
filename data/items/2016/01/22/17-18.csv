I&#x27;m glad it was written, because I&#x27;ve seen nothing but hype for Unikernels on Hacker News (and in ACM, etc.) for the last 2 years.  It&#x27;s great to see the other side of the story.<p>The biggest problem with Unikernels like Mirage is the single language constraint (mentioned in the article).  I actually love OCaml, but it&#x27;s only suitable for very specific things... e.g. I need to run linear algebra in production.  I&#x27;m not going to rewrite everything in OCaml.  That&#x27;s a nonstarter.<p>An I entirely agree with the point that Unikernel simplicity is mostly a result of their immaturity.  A kernel like seL4 is also simple, because like unikernels, it doesn&#x27;t have that many features.<p>If you want secure foundations, something like seL4 might be better to start from than Unikernels.  We should be looking at the fundamental architectural characteristics, which I think this post does a great job on.<p>It seems to me that unikernels are fundamentally MORE complex than containers with the Linux kernel.

Complete social collapse, as has happened many times throughout history, can have a really bad effect on technological innovation. Focusing specifically on the Roman empire (because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m more familiar with), here are three off the top of my head:<p>* The various methods to making various different kinds of concrete have been lost and rediscovered several times [0]. Early concrete-like materials were used as far back as 6500BC by the Nabataeans. In both Roman and Egyptian times it was re-discovered that adding volcanic ash to the mix allowed it to set underwater. The Roman methods for making concrete were lost again following the collapse of the Western empire and were not rediscovered in Europe until the 1400s.<p>* Roman roads were extremely well engineered [1], to the point that some are still around today. While this wasn&#x27;t &quot;lost&quot; per se (we could always go dig up a Roman road and see how it was made), the Roman road system in Europe deteriorated because of lack of resources and skills to maintain them. [2]<p>* The Romans made extensive use of plumbing [3], but much of that was again lost in Europe after the fall of the Western empire. The Roman Empire had indoor plumbing, meaning a system of aqueducts and pipes that terminated in homes (at least of wealthy people) and at public wells and fountains for people to use. [4] Lead pipe was used (okay, so maybe that part wasn&#x27;t so great), and there were sewer systems [5]. Even the word &quot;plumbing&quot; derives from the Latin word <i>plumbum</i> for lead. Following the fall of the Roman Empire, plumbing development virtually ceased for centuries except for isolated cases of plumbing installed in palaces and castles.<p>These three things are so integral to the modern world we probably don&#x27;t even think about them much, just assume they were always there. But not too long ago (at least on the scale of human civilization), they weren&#x27;t.<p>TL;DR the Romans were awesome engineers.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete#History"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete#History</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_roads#Construction_and_engineering"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_roads#Construction_and_e...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_road_transport"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_road_transport</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation_in_ancient_Rome"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation_in_ancient_Rome</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_water_supply_and_sanitation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_water_supply_and_sa...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_water#Pipe_materials"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_water#Pipe_materials</a>",1453484748

Amazon and Linode just rebooted a bunch of machines because of a Xen vulnerability.  Could something like Xen be more secure than the Linux kernel?  Maybe.  That&#x27;s a good question, and one I haven&#x27;t seen the answer to.<p>I actually doubt it because emulating hardware is probably full of more &quot;C tricks&quot; than kernel code, but I&#x27;m not an expert here.  Another complication is that when you use a hypervisor, you always have Linux <i>in addition</i>.  You generally use its drivers for the real hardware.  It would seem that Linux + hypervisor is less secure than Linux alone.  But there are probably some mitigating factors.<p>2) &quot;And to the degree that unikernels don’t contain much code, it seems more by infancy (and, for the moment, irrelevancy) than by design.&quot;<p>I agree that unikernels are smaller at the moment mostly because they don&#x27;t have a lot of features.  (Writing in a memory safe language helps, but it also hurts!

The DS does a really, really, really good job at letting players choose when and where they play.  Games start up instantly, pausing and resuming is seamless.  I don&#x27;t know how much work developers need to do to support suspend/resume, but I&#x27;ve never seen it not work.<p>In my experience on Android, very few games deal well with getting killed in the background.  Yes, this is different than what happens in the DS, but the user experience should be the same.  From what I can tell, there is more burden on an Android developer to deliver a seamless resume experience than there is on the DS.<p>Because of that, you can&#x27;t trust that your game state will be preserved if you do something as simple as lock your phone while your game is running.  If you resume, will your game be where you left off?  Who knows.  Add on functionality that requires online access, and you end up with a platform where people prefer games that load quicker and where you can finish a session in the time it takes to stand in line, if only for the simple reason that anything more complicated usually ends in frustration.",1453484464

Scheduling one process over another would be no more expensive than jumping from one green (userspace) thread to another on regular OSes, which would be a <i>huge</i> change compared to current OSes, but isn&#x27;t quite a unikernel, at least under the provided definition.<p>Along similar lines, I could imagine a lightweight strace that has basically the overhead of something like LD_PRELOAD (i.e., much lower overhead than traditional strace, which has to stop the process, schedule the tracer, and copy memory from the tracee to the tracer, all of which is slow if you care about process isolation). And as soon as you add lightweight processes, you get tcpdump and netstat and all that other fun stuff.<p>On another note, I&#x27;m curious if hypervisors are inherently easier <i>to secure</i> (not currently more secure in practice) than kernels.

A hypervisor offers very low-level abstractions: one or more virtual CPUs, a fixed amount of RAM, one or more virtual block devices, and one or more virtual network interfaces. An operating system, by contrast, typically offers much higher-level abstractions: one or more processes (each of which may have multiple threads), a pool of memory from which the processes can dynamically allocate what they need, a filesystem, and a network protocol stack. These higher-level abstractions are quite mature, so one argument against unikernels is that it is grossly inefficient for each application to bring its own impoverished versions of them. Instead, if applications can run in secure containers on bare metal, as in FreeBSD jails or Illumos zones, then they can efficiently share resources, particularly RAM and storage, under a single OS kernel.",1453484022

This is actually not a weekend project, I tried for it to be, but I failed. It actually took me 5 days to have it as it is right now. So I’m still profoundly skeptic on how to realize a 48 hrs side project with the look and feel and quality I would be satisfied with.<p>Here is how I spent most of the time. I worked between 8 and 14 hrs a day (I’m on vacation)\n- Searching and choosing a keepandplay.com domain - 2 hrs.<p>- Keepandplay backend - 1 day<p>- Logo design 6 hrs. I created 18 different prototypes<p>- Frontend design - 3 days. Even though this site looks really simple, designing it was really hard for me. Sometimes I found myself spending more time on design than on code. I basically took screenshots from similar sites (youtube, courser, onreplaytv, soundcloud, vimeo, vine, itunes, vevo) put them on an Omnigraffle page and compared all of them. Keepandplay is a combination of Soundcloud, Vine and OnreplayTV.<p>- Dealing with not required but necessary settings - 6 hrs<p>+ It’s hard to believe, but developing a “simple” (48 hrs) website has a lot of stuff going on:<p><pre><code>	    - Responsive design from 320x480 to 1920x1080, not forgetting portrait and landscape\n\n	    - Favicons - which sometimes requires different logo design since the image is not big\n\n	    - Setting some analytics tracker. i.e. register, generate code…\n\n	    - Register site on Google SEO site\n</code></pre>\nNow it’s already really late over here… I’m glad I’m finished now and I hope you guys like the outcome.

You use the (excellent) Erlang tooling to connect to it, and interrogate it/trace it/profile it/observe it/etc. The Erlang runtime <i>is</i> an OS, in every sense of the word; running Erlang on Linux is truly just <i>redundant</i>, since you&#x27;ve already got all the OS you need. That&#x27;s what justifies making an Erlang app a unikernel.<p>But that&#x27;s an argument coming from the perspective of someone tasked with maintaining persistent long-running instances. When you&#x27;re in that sort of situation, you <i>need</i> the sort of things an OS provides. And that&#x27;s actually rather rare.<p>The true &quot;good fit&quot; use-case of Unikernels is in immutable infrastructure. You <i>don&#x27;t</i> debug a unikernel, mostly; you just kill and replace it (you &quot;let it crash&quot;, in Erlang terms.) Unikernels are a formalization of the (already prevalent) use-case where you launch some ephemeral VMs or containers as a static, mostly-internally-stateless &quot;release slug&quot; of your application tier, and then roll out an upgrade by starting up new &quot;slugs&quot; and terminating old ones. You can&#x27;t really &quot;debug&quot; those (except via instrumentation compiled into your app, ala NewRelic.) They&#x27;re black boxes. A unikernel just statically links the whole black box together.<p>Keep in mind, &quot;debugging&quot; is two things: development-time debugging and production-time debugging. It&#x27;s only the latter that unikernels are fundamentally bad at. For dev-time debugging, both MirageOS and Erlang-on-Xen come with ways to compile your app as an OS process rather than as a VM image. When you are trying to <i>integration-test</i> your app, you integration-test the process version of it. When you&#x27;re trying to <i>smoke-test</i> your app, you can still use the process version—or you can launch (an instrumented copy of) the VM image. Either way, it&#x27;s no harder than dev-time debugging of a regular non-unikernel app.",1453483577

The Mongols were able to plunder the surrounding lands.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a bit of an oversimplification. China was much closer to the Mongols&#x27; logistical base. By the 1240s, as the Horde pushed into Central Europe, they were experiencing rebellions in Asia that threatened their supply lines. So extended sieges were not feasible.<p>It&#x27;s telling that the limit of their incursions pretty closely adheres to the boundary of stone fortification diffusion in Central Europe at that time. Polish and Russian nobles still favored wood fortifications, though Western Europeans had brought back defensive masonry techniques from the Crusades and rapidly developed stone castle infrastructure in their home regions. Stone fortifications increased the time required for a siege and increased the cost in men and material, even with the Mongols&#x27; relatively effective siege tactics. The Mongols could not afford to conduct such sieges so far from their logistical base on the steppes, especially not while maintaining control of their often fractious conquests in Central Asia and Russia.<p>So it&#x27;s a confluence of factors that limited the Mongol advance, including the relatively challenging terrain of Central European mountains and forests and the increasing frequency of heavily fortified stone-walled fortifications as they pushed farther west.<p>That said, outside the particular example of the 13th century Mongols, the effectiveness of steppe light cavalry against fortified European cities is at best questionable. The Avars and Hungarians were defeated by western nations once they attempted to push into fortified territory, despite the lack of stone fortifications in 9th and 10th century Europe. And, as you say, it was the incorporation of Chinese siege tactics that permitted the Mongols to succeed against fortified cities, not their prowess as light cavalry archers.",1453483490

It is also a Government sponsored project and probably wasn&#x27;t cheap. The point still stands that compositing a book was far more labor intensive with chinese characters than with any alphabet. You need a few dozen types for an alphabet and at least 100 times more fore Chinese. An alphabet makes it considerably cheaper and not reserved to a tiny elite with 64 copies. That&#x27;s the main point. Common people couldn&#x27;t afford it.<p>There is no doubt possible that using an alphabet greatly helped the dissemination of knowledge. Between 1455 and 1500 there were over 30,000 distinct incunables edited in europe. Not 30,000 copies. More than 30,000 different books. [1] \nGutenberg&#x27;s press went viral [2] and vastly more widespread than what was seen in Asia.<p>In the 15th century Korea adopted Hangul, the Korean alphabet.  \n&quot;A potential solution to the linguistic and cultural bottleneck that held back movable type in Korea for 200 years appeared in the early 15th century—a generation before Gutenberg would begin working on his own movable-type invention in Europe—when Sejong the Great devised a simplified alphabet of 24 characters (hangul) for use by the common people, which could have made the typecasting and compositing process more feasible. Adoption of the new alphabet was stifled by Korea&#x27;s cultural elite, who were &quot;appalled at the idea of losing hanja, the badge of their elitism.&quot;<p>&quot;It was effective enough at disseminating information among the uneducated that Yeonsangun, the paranoid tenth king, forbade the study or use of Hangul and banned Hangul documents in 1504,and King Jungjong abolished the Ministry of Eonmun (governmental institution related to Hangul research) in 1506.<p>The late 16th century, however, saw a revival of Hangul&quot; [3]<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incunabula_Short_Title_Catalogue"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incunabula_Short_Title_Catalog...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_spread_of_the_printing_press"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_spread_of_the_printing_...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type#Metal_movable_type_in_Korea"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type#Metal_movable_typ...</a> & <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul#History"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul#History</a>",1453483284

Early on, the author has a lot to say against other teaching approaches that present Quantum Physics as fundamentally mysterious (&quot;No one really understands it anyway, just use these equations&quot;) or leave out the Many-Worlds interpretation:<p>>I am not going to tell you that quantum mechanics is weird, bizarre, confusing, or alien.  QM is counterintuitive, but that is a problem with your intuitions, not a problem with quantum mechanics. [...] It is always best to think of reality as perfectly normal.<p>>Dragging a modern-day student through all this [initially teaching the subject in the order it was discovered] may be a historically realistic approach to the subject matter, but it also ensures the historically realistic outcome of total bewilderment.  Talking to aspiring young physicists about &quot;wave/particle duality&quot; is like starting chemistry students on the Four Elements. [...] The universe is not wavering between using particles and waves, unable to make up its mind.  It&#x27;s only human intuitions about QM that swap back and forth.",1453482989

10954009,comment,10952848,10953075,0,0,OliverJones,,,"Ethics is a slippery subject. Different people have different ethical stances, so if I were to say &quot;that&#x27;s unethical&quot; to you, you&#x27;d be likely to misunderstand me.<p>One common ethical stance is utilitarianism. This stance purports to optimize collective welfare. I don&#x27;t know any NSA people, but it seems likely that they share a utilitarian approach to ethical decision making, and they define happiness as security from evildoers. (I&#x27;m speculating about their stance, not claiming it to be my stance.) Selfish interest is part of utilitarianism.<p>For example, if you have a utilitarian stance you might choose to refrain from having sex with strangers to protect your health and theirs.<p>Another ethical stance is deontology. In this stance you refrain from having sex with strangers because it&#x27;s externally defined as wrong. For example, &quot;Do not commit adultery&quot; shows up in one common collection of externally defined rules. If you say to someone, &quot;that&#x27;s illegal&quot; you&#x27;re speaking from a deontological stance.<p>A third stance is altruism. When operating in that stance, people value the welfare of others above their own welfare. Many who donate blood do so from an altruistic stance.<p>Real people have a combination of actual stances. And for most of us, our real, operative stances are often not quite aligned with what we say our stances are. That&#x27;s just reality. Almost nobody completely walks their talk on this stuff.<p>An engineer who works through the night to repair a critical defect probably has a combination of ethical attitudes. Trying to make users happy is altruism. It may also be deontological -- they&#x27;re violating their quality agreements. It may also be selfish and utilitarian: losing face, losing revenue and getting fired are to be avoided. All that is fine.<p>Life is harder when different people have contradictory stances. The life and death of Aaron Swartz is a tragic example of that.<p>Immanuel Kant proposed the &quot;categorical imperative&quot;. (Oversimplifying) he suggests that we should live and behave ourselves the way we WISH everybody would live and behave. Professional codes of ethics attempt to employ the idea of the categorical imperative to create a shared ethical stance.<p>Codes of ethics are helpful precisely because of the slipperiness of ethics. Good codes of ethics offer a common language. And they serve to convert various ethical stances into deontological stances--written external collections of rules to follow. They make it easier for us to predict each others&#x27; ethical behavior.<p>So, a plea: when questions of ethics are up for grabs, let&#x27;s be explicit about our own ethical stances and generous when trying to interpret other peoples&#x27; stances.",1453482786

But from my perspective this looks like a costly design mistake. Looseness is the key to being able to scale down, and strictness is its antithesis. Rust just doesn&#x27;t offer a forgiving mode that approaches the kind of ergonomy you get from a less strict, garbage-collected language.<p>I think Nim made a better, more flexible choice, in offering a kind of graduated safety — you can restrict functions (for immutability, memory safety, exception handling, etc.), but the default is wide open. In my experience, this correlates to the top-down structure of programs: You want the foundation (runtime, stdlib etc.) to be as hardened as possible, because you can afford to spend lots of time on it, since it&#x27;s the most used code that needs to be the most stable over a longer period of time.

Genghis was far from the best Mongol general but he personally achieved some impressive victories by attacking from the rear of his opponent after going over mountains or by luring his opponents up onto mountains after him.<p>But really both light and heavy cavalry were important parts of the regular Mongol forces as well as the hordes of arrow-fodder they would levy from captured cities.  And while the Mongols didn&#x27;t start out with much in the way of a siege train they had the world&#x27;s best siege engineers by the time they finally finished off the Jin dynasty.<p>The hot, wet environment of India was a big barrier to their expansion as was their navel weakness.  But Europe benefited mostly by being so far away and from the fact that the Mongols hadn&#x27;t finished off the Song by the time the empire started to fragment.<p>Sources: A number of things over the years but I recently finished <i>Genghis Khan: His Conquests, His Empire, His Legacy</i>.",1453482171

Both T-Mobile and AT&T have been fine with me, forgiving the price gouging that occurs with all providers.  The prospect of switching to Sprint is not a big deal for me.  I just make the payment to someone else and I get to keep my phone number.  Meh.<p>However, I will say that I would like to be on Verizon for the simple fact that almost everyone I know is on Verizon and I could get by with a 25 minute/month plan.  :)",1241696825

597745,comment,597563,597563,0,0,demallien,,,"Good grief.  If I read one more article based on 'X multitasks better than the iPhone', I think I am going to scream.<p>None of the iPhone competitors pack much more under the bonnet than the iPhone, at least when talking about Mb and MHz.  The iPhone already has trouble just running a computationally intensive task (such as a 3D game) with the background system tasks running.  It also has problems with battery life as these apps go through the juice. Hands up everyone that has put the iPhone in sleep mode whilst there is a 3rd party app running, which decides to not actually stop running?  You go back and find that you have barely any battery left.  How often do you think that is going to happen to people when they are running <i>multiple</i> apps?<p>I have not seen anywhere any indication whatsoever that Palm has solved these limitations.  If a user truly does decide to run several apps in the background, we have every reason to believe that they will have a dog of an experience, in terms of responsiveness of the system, and battery life.  Unless, as I have already said, Palm has found a way to build a system that is an order of magnitude more lightweight than iPhone OS, and nobody seems to be saying that.",1241694257

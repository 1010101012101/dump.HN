My guess is that the average Roomba owner doesn't have a PC with a serial port, and probably wouldn't want to acquire an uncommon connector and wire up a serial converter cable, and then run some program on their PC to dump the firmware image in to the Roomba.  The osmo dongle makes the process near foolproof for soccer moms and grandmothers and so on.",1262696157

I see no reason to believe understanding how the lump of meat inside my head works would require an upheaval in scientific knowledge.

1032276,comment,1031654,1031654,0,0,10ren,,,"This reminds me of a ""finder's fee"", where you pay someone for recommending your product. It's similar, because the recommender has an incentive to promote your product, regardless of whether it is appropriate for the buyer or not. I know these kinds of arrangements are common, and they form a nicely logical model - but I don't like the moral hazard.<p>It also reminds me of advertising-supported media (free to air TV, newspapers, magazines, and of course... google's internet), in that there are two parties who may collude to the detriment of the consumer. So, you have ""advertorial"", that appears to be impartial, but isn't; and advertiser-friendly news stories and angles. Have you noticed how the Simpsons and Futurama depict drinking alcohol? Have you ever thought ""I wouldn't mind a drink"" while watching? Advertiser-friendly. Even Sponge-bob square-pants features burgers prominently.

There's some fantastic technical comments, good business comments, but then a lot of pessimism/contrarianism/snark/etc on some more general topics.<p>If I may, humbly, let me say that I think this is something that kind of sucks for someone so bright. You're obviously a very very smart dude, but what does the 10-20% of contrarian/snark really add?<p>I don't know, maybe I'm making much ado about nothing, but I get an inkling here that you've got smart-person-and-like-to-show-it going on. Y'know how I see it? I used to do that shit <i>a lot</i>. When I realized how often I used to do it, I cut it out, because it was crippling. Even a small percent of no-value-add critique/snark coming from me made me a hell of a lot less likable despite 80-90% of what I was saying being somewhat valuable stuff.<p>It doesn't mean I don't think the critique/snark/etc, I just try to kill it before hitting the ""post"" button online. I still write a lot of those comments, just try to realize it and eliminate it reasonably soon. If I must critique, I try to insist on adding some value while doing it. It doesn't always work, but I reckon I get a lot more mileage out of conversing now after doing that. Kind of a hard slog to eliminate that old habit, but it's very much been worth it.",1262693923

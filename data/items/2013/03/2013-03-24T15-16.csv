The argument was that children should be protected from dangerous driving, which is basically indisputable. Those opposed pointed out that no children had ever been injured in the county's school zones, raising concerns that the measure was designed purely for revenue, when other intersections probably needed better enforcement.<p>Now, I don't know, maybe the County Commissioner had a kid approaching school age, and saw someone speed on that road, and made some hasty, biased risk calculations. I don't know if the chance for ""tickets in school zones"" money drove the push.<p>But I feel like we are generally terrible at catching the ""opportunity costs"" of legislation. If W. Va. wants to stop people from killing each other on the roadways, maybe it shouldn't be looking at Google Glass, but looking to add structural improvements to its most dangerous intersections, on-ramps, and exit-ramps. It could prevent deaths next year without making anything else illegal.<p>Since a legislature can only solve so many problems in a year, fixing the imagined ""google glass"" problem actually means other problems go unsolved. Because of that, even if they were solving a real problem, it could still reflect a failure of governance.<p>The investment analogy would be that it's not enough to just get some return on investment, your measuring stick is whether or not you make a better return than you could have for equivalent risk. Mere profit is sometimes a waste of capital. Legislation that saves one or two lives over the course of the next 20 years, but squanders the opportunity to save hundreds more, should be seen as essentially responsible for the difference in deaths.<p>I don't think we've really solved this problem for public action though in any state, not to mention the national level.<p>I'd be interested if anyone has a solution. So far all I've got is ""only let actuaries vote,"" but that might not be the utopian paradise I imagine...",1364140775

Possibly above the 75th percentile and certainly above the 90th, it swings the other way, and hard.<p>First, when you're really good, you tend to get into conflict with intermediate players to whom you're a threat rather than an asset. Your company might benefit abstractly from you being good, but ""The Company"" doesn't write your performance reviews. Maybe your boss gives you shitty work so you don't develop and become a threat. Possibly, mediocre colleagues tear you down. At the 80th percentile, you'll almost never be fired for low performance but there's little overperformance risk. At the 95th, you can be a fucking lighting rod for resentment in a nasty, dysfunctional environment and, let's be honest, most work environments are pretty broken.<p>Second, there are all the risks you have to take to <i>get</i> good.

Now, of course, the difference has mostly been arbitraged away, but it took decades to get to this point.<p>At the time, people gave many reasons sexism couldn't possibly exist in finance; naturally, more men went into finance because women just <i>didn't like</i> finance, and more men had senior positions because simply <i>didn't want</i> senior positions, and so on and so forth (oddly enough, those same reasons are given today, in discussions of sexism in CS and engineering).<p>In 1987, Townsend-Greenspan shut down, after thirty successful years, because Greenspan became chairman of the Fed. Now, twenty-six years later, the gender gap among MBAs is much smaller than it used to be, but it hasn't disappeared. I hope it doesn't take fifty-six years from the founding of Etsy for someone to be able to make a comment like this about programmers.<p>I'm afraid it might be a while, though. In discussions about the topic here on HN, the top comment is often something along the lines of how there obviously isn't any sexism in the field, or if there is any, it's rare, and certainly not a systematic problem, and how it's simply impossible that the highly skewed male:female ratio in the field is due to sexism. That's usually followed by a paragraph on how any attempts to address the issue are an insidious cause of reverse sexism.<p>The top comment in the previous thread on this topic was a comment about how everything Etsy is doing applies equally to all people, not just women, despite a large body of research indicating that, on average, women are treated differently in the workplace [1], and how some simple changes can neutralize many serious problems [2].<p>[1] Perhaps someone else can supply a reference to a well-known study that I can't seem to look up. When men react with anger, or act authoritatively, that's seen neutrally or positively, but when women do the same, it's seen negatively.<p>[2] <a href=""http://papers.nber.org/papers/w18511"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.nber.org/papers/w18511</a>",1364139499

If a 60-year-old is doing good, productive work, enjoys it, and wishes to continue it, why should he or she retire?<p>Your argument, at least in the broader sense, seems to rely on the fallacy that there are a fixed number of jobs, and an older worker who chooses to continue working is ""taking the place"" of someone younger.<p>In more restricted contexts, such as academia, this <i>is</i> more or less true, and the tenure system does allow for older professors to stop pulling their weight if they choose. (Most of them don't do so.)<p>But are you prepared to demand of older, productive workers that they quit simply because you would like to take their place?

Between stars there is not all that much velocity, so time is a relatively stable concept.  Sure it'll wander a few percent but nothing nearly as drastic as having no sense of 'now'.<p>Don't forget that when you bring relativistic speeds into the mix <i>you can't agree on distances either</i>.

This includes the functions you might have forgotten about.<p>Now lets look at how this would explicitly work in your example of dancing enemies. In a pure functional language, your game logic is probably something along the lines of GameState a = State GameWorld a, with GameWorld a type describing the state of your world.<p>To add the dancing koopa troopa logic, you'd merely need to modify the GameState object and include (MusicTrack, MusicTime) as a field. There would be very little messing around with type signatures - the function advanceEnemyState: () -> GameState EnemyState is already expected to vary based on the world.",1311487969

2798767,comment,2797016,2797471,1,0,epidemian,,,"> > OO languages (i.e. imperative)\n>\n> Why can't an OO language be functional?<p>Yes, I think you are totally right. As I see it, OO is about data and behaviour encapsulation, and object polymorphism. There is no reason why objects need to carry mutable state. But, they often do, and I think most authors do put OOP in the procedural/imperative side of programming.<p>Of course come cool hybrid languages do mix concepts from OOP and functional programming in order to have more expressive power. But most of them still map pretty closely to the Von Neumann model: a set of statements executed one after the other that alter the program's state, and hence are imperative too.<p>A functional program does not map it's computation to this Von Neuman model, which pretty much represents how computers work, but to an abstract model, usually based on mathematical concepts.<p>Therefore,<p><pre><code>  even = filter(nats[1:100], i -> i % 2 == 0)\n</code></pre>\nwould be functional or not depending on the underlying execution model. A functional programing language would guarantee that the function passed to `filter` is side-effect-free, so it can be free to make the computation of the result in parallel or lazily or whatnot. An imperative language would be required to execute the passed function for each element of the sequence in a defined order, as that function might very well not be side-effect-free.<p>But, in the end, I think that all that is a very absolutist approach to what is functional and what is not. Trying to draw that line is usually quite futile, as it really depends on very strict definitions, and, well, everybody agreeing on those definitions. I just wanted to clarify my point a little bit (though I probably failed)<p>> On the other hand, these concepts and expressions are used with so many different meanings and in so many different contexts, that it's no surprise that different people understand them differently. Maybe it's better to just talk in code...<p>Totaly agreed. Probably a more ""fuzzy"" definition of ""functional"", thus allowing one to say that some construct ""more functional"" than an other one, is more pragmatic. I also would say that<p><pre><code>  even = filter(nats[1:100], i -> i % 2 == 0)\n</code></pre>\nis much ""more functional"", or declarative, than<p><pre><code>  even = []\n  for i = 1 to 100\n    if i % 2 == 0\n      even.append(i)\n</code></pre>\nAnd I would even say that Python's list comprehensions are even more declarative, even though it is an imperative language too:<p><pre><code>  even = [i for i in range(0,100) if i % 2 == 0]\n</code></pre>\nCode FTW!",1311487898

All the illegal immigrants currently in detention are released, since we don't have the money to put them on a plane, and we cannot actually simply leave them in a cell without electricity, sanitation, or food to see what happens.\n  - All of our troops stationed abroad quickly run out of electricity or fuel.

Even if it's true, it doesn't warrant the implication that Spotify doesn't provide a value-based service, or that it's bait-and-switch, or that they have malicious intent, or that it can't be a supplement to buying music a traditional way.<p>To look at it another way. I have, in my current library of music, listened to over 400 albums in the last 3 years. I'm not ashamed to admit that I've not paid for all of them. The heavily listened to favorites, I have, but not all. Even if Spotify quadrupled in cost... it would still be small compared to (400 * $5) or (400 * $10).

Disclaimer: not trying to start a discussion on languages, or lang war.<p>I'm not sure why you'd want to disclaim trying to start a discussion on languages; it seems like a good thing.<p>The sentence I wrote was originally intended just to describe TeX, but it seemed to me in retrospect that it applied almost as well to Lisp.  Although the design philosophies of the two languages are completely different, both are intended to be the foundations for lots of little languages; Knuth has said that he was always surprised that people were happy to settle so quickly on TeX and LaTeX, rather than creating and selecting among many more specialised dialects.  (Of course, a quick glance at CTAN shows that it is folly to think that everyone who uses TeX or LaTeX does the same thing with it!)<p>I posted some more examples of highly customisable little languages at <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1535807"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1535807</a>, but I should mention that I haven't used them.",1281632363

Open a twitter and facebook company account. Invite all your friends and colleagues. 
Follow interesting people (blogger and tech leader). Most importantly: don't spam, but engage in conversations.<p>. Blog -
Obviously, you need a blog. Don't make it a boring marketing blog. Keep a personal voice. Talk about your experience building the product/company. Share advices.<p>. YouTube -
Upload screencasts of your product<p>. Conferences -
That's the best place to meet bloggers. Hang around with your company (funny) t-shirt, hat, something that attract the attention of the people. That's a good ice-breaker to start talking to people.<p>. Startup Competitions -  
That's the best way to go to techcrunch or important blogs. Participate in startup competition. You don't need to win; just with the participation you'll see the name of your company in the major blogs.<p>All these thing won't probably be enough to be featured on the NYT, but they will certainly spread out the name of your company/product. At least, it worked quite well in my case.",1281632181

There's lots of rules about it and it's perfectly reasonable to do in many situations. For instance, securitized risk is held off balance sheet because it effectively isn't an asset, liability or risk to the company that securitized it anymore. (That's the whole point of securitizing risk.) It is in general not true that ""nobody can see them"", since stuff like this generally has to be declared in financial reports. Yeah, you can't see it... if you're a lazy investor who just reads the quarterly financial statements and thinks that constitutes responsible investing.<p>There are some companies that try to cook the books and game the rules. Surprise. Whenever there are rules people will try to game them.

When you have only one baby, (so there's not an older brother causing problems), you can get a lot of work done sitting next to the baby's crib.  Type type type, hand him a bottle if he wants, or change him if he wants, or pacifier him if he wants, and then it's type type type again.<p>As they get older, the sleep becomes less and less, and you're so grateful when it comes that you tip toe around the house, hoping not to wake them up.  From that point on, you will get less and less work done in the day time, as they sleep less and less in the day time.  At that point, I started going to bed with him at 8:00PM or so, and waking at 2:00AM and then working away till it was time to go to my day job.  It was the only time I could get any peace and quiet to focus.<p>One of our problems has been that our house is too open, so when the baby is sleeping in the swing or the boppy, the whole house needs to shut down.  They spend 8 hours a night in their crib, which I assume you have in a bedroom, so they hate the crib.  For daytime naps, they often refuse the crib (at least mine do), so you're stuck with them sleeping somewhere else that may not be as private from the rest of the house as you would like.

And I don't exactly sit around comparing tax returns with my friends and acquaintances.  But, I certainly get the impression that I'm making more as a FTE than most contractors around here.  (To be fair, I'm also making more than most salaried employees as well.)  The guys I know who contract never seem to have as much work as they want.  They're always juggling a couple gigs to make ends meet.  Their wives are constantly bugging them to just get a ""real job"" so they can pay the bills.  So, I think the idea that you could quit your job and just step into contracting and double your pay is misleading.",1281629133

Bloomberg reports Cisco Misses Estimates on Sluggish Corporate Spending. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reports Cisco Profit Jumps 79%.</i><p>Sounds like a great opportunity to go long Cisco, right? It's trading down 9% on the missed estimates news while in reality, having your profits up 79% and same-quarter sales up 20% over last year, especially in this economy, is not a bad thing.<p>But wait, here is a later post from another equally respected blog:<p><i>The book cooking continues. CISCO comes out with ""great"" earnings but hidden in there is the fact that they're writing their own financing - and holding it off-book. Better hope $21 holds, because if it doesn't it's a LONG way down.</i><p>Wait a second - so those supposedly realized profits are really just an I-owe-you note from Cisco to itself? Ok then.<p>Here is my point. <i>Almost every company out there is hiding assets and liabilities off balance sheet where nobody can see them.</i> It's fun to talk about complex economic theories but come on, the biggest reason the average investor can't get performance out of the stock market is the book cooking. Had the banking industry not held all that subprime risk off their books, the market would <i>not</i> have seen all that volatility, and we <i>would</i> have seen real Dow growth.<p>As things stand, value investors short of a team of private investigator-style analysts simply cannot afford to trust their own judgement. When the SEC stops focusing on Martha Stuart's insider trading and start going after the real issues, the stock market will recover, democratization or not.",1281629109

1598413,comment,1596499,1598312,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"TeX starts with a collection of macros called Plain.TeX that get written out in 'binary' so that they load quickly.  'The TeXBook' essentially assumes Plain.TeX.<p>As I recall, for LaTeX, there were some tweaks to Plain.TeX, and I don't understand the tweaks.  There is a chance from the tweaks that some of the scope of names in TeX and LaTeX are different.<p>But, for scope of names, essentially as in a 'namespace', or as in name scoping in, say, PL/I or Algol or OOP languages, TeX has that done nicely at least for just one macro at a time.  So, if bring in a macro, then need not worry about names within the macro conflicting with names outside the macro.  Among the macros I wrote are some for dynamic allocation of storage of the various types within a macro.<p>For more, long names are permitted so that could use those to identify a 'package' or 'namespace' of many macros that call each other.<p>For more, I'd have to get out 'The TeXBook' and read again!  The bad news for me is, I wrote the macros a long time ago so do not remember all the details.  Indeed, what I wrote for verbatim was darned tricky, and I'd need two hours just to understand the crucial points in those.<p>But 'The TeXBook' is plenty readable.  For some questions, can write some little tracing and printing macros (I did) and use the TIFO method, try it and find out.<p>Broadly, though, it does appear to me that Knuth was mostly thinking about one author with mostly their own macros and was not thinking about some world wide 'distributed' document and software development with a world wide name 'registration hierarchy', etc.  In particular, if I were to send you some of my work with TeX, what could I send?  My TeX input file?  Darn, that assumes my full macro collection, and I wouldn't want to bother you with that.  So, send you a DVI file?  That assumes that you have the same font collection I do, and just what that is is not always so clear.  So, net, the easiest thing to send is just a PDF file that has the font definitions inside the file.  Broadly, then 'group' work was not a big design priority.<p>I have a friend, a good mathematician, who won't touch TeX and keeps running it down.  Some of his criticisms are valid.  E.g., look at 'The TeXBook':  Essentially just one color.  On each page, usually just one column.  No page to page cross references.  Not much in graphics except where the pictures are on their own pages, e.g., at the beginnings of the chapters.  Positioning pictures to be close to corresponding text is a pain (unless there are some fancy macros I don't know about).  Just how to get running headers and footers more than just simple single lines a bit tricky to understand.  Something of a pain unless just use the Computer Modern fonts and the AMS symbols and a few more, e.g., the Euler fonts good for more math symbols.<p>The glory, then, is in what TeX does with mathematical expressions, and there it's just terrific:  Just type in stuff, and immediately or soon it looks great.  And surprisingly complicated expressions still look great just 'in line' instead of in 'display mode'.  I do wish there were more sizes of brackets, etc.!<p>In my career in math, by far, I mean FAR, FAR^10, the most difficult problem, WAY more difficult than anything else, was JUST getting the math typing done.  The math itself, for my Ph.D. dissertation, my published papers, my technical papers, was always MUCH easier than just the typing.  The typing for the math was HELL.  TeX solved that problem -- now I can do some math, type it in, and have something looks good right away.  My main complaint is just that the Computer Modern fonts look WAY too light in PDF.<p>If someone wants to do another TeX, fine with me.  In the meanwhile, for me, TeX makes high quality word whacking a solved problem so that I get to concentrated on other things.",1281628930

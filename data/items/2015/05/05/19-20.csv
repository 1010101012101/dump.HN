I was going birdwatching that morning, and was up around 5am because the walk to the lagoon was a good 45 minutes from where I lived, and early morning is great for birding. I had a pair of binoculars, a field guide, and a lunch in my backpack.<p>Two obviously bored deputies stopped me, talked to me for about 60 minutes, checked my backpack and generally couldn&#x27;t believe a kid would be out on his own free will at that early a time.<p>No probable cause, I wasn&#x27;t trespassing (walked the entire way on the sidewalk), but stopped because I was out of the ordinary.

About fake IDs, I have heard that a lot in the US. In France, I don&#x27;t know but who am I to tell, I was born there and I just live there.\nYou can buy alcohol when you are 18 and it is easy to get anyway so young people\ndon&#x27;t care so there is less binge drinking than in the US. Forbidding something\nis always the best incitation.<p>I am French, lives in a mixed ethnic suburb south of Paris and knows well Paris, lived in silicon valley for three years too. In Paris, I don&#x27;t know such a thing as non French speaking neighbourhood, meaning a place where you could speak French without the vast majority of people capable of answering you in perfect non accented French. There are places that you could call ethnic with a majority of (French) people of non european descent.  I don&#x27;t know about any nogozone contrary to the map presented by Fox. The original map was probably about something, but it&#x27;s your guess. Places where housing is substandard, probably.<p>If you are a girl, expect cat calls from young boys. People lets their dog shit everywhere (that has been  worse in the past). If you go in touristic places, watch your wallet and count your change. Touristic places are for tourists so you will find your\nMac Donalds and Star Bucks. Prêt à porter with sky high price, too. Boring. Expensive.\nLike any town, there are places whee there are all sort of traffics. News at eleven. Stay away. Unlike many towns in the US, the regular police is not militarized. In fact, municipal polices are not allowed to carry guns. Better to be white or be a tourist with the police if you don&#x27;t want you id often asked for, but beating to death are very rare.<p>There may place where cops don&#x27;t go but that may have to do with real estate speculation and future gentrification. Forty years ago, Near Gare Montparnasse, they did let rot a whole area, so they could cheaply expropriate lower middle class people. The police station was 100 meters away. When construction started they dumped the squatters. I know for a fact, I rented a place as a student then. Now, you can buy a nice flat here with people like you, if you have the money.<p>But please don&#x27;t listen on @cnn or @fox the crap from jewish supremacists like @pamelageller or @rabbischmulley who don&#x27;t know anything about France, and probably never set foot there. Better for @pamelageller, because by French standards, she looks like a hooker.\nContrary to what @rabbischmulley said, there was no progrom avoided by police but a street fight initiated by jewish supremacists. This was provoked in a street with a synagogue but the rabbi of the said synagogue said it was never a target. French press\nwas not so forthcoming with the truth. \nContrary to what @pamelaGeller says, France is not surrounded by ennemies (supposedly arabs). Does she know that France is in Europe and only 10% of its population is originally from Maghreb.<p>Criminality wise,  Paris is a very average town, except for disenfranchised population of arabic origin who have taken twice the street with French people against Israel exaction in Gaza.<p>I am fed up of the press that takes France in hostage because Israel chooses to systemically violates international laws and at the same time wants to portrays jews as victims and arabs as terrorists.\nAfter the terrorist attack against the kasher store, there was a lot of incidents\nagainst arabs. Usually not reported, excepted when a comic strike like a girl whose robe\nwas too long and was deemed ostentasiously religious. Every incident involved a jew\nis reported. Police takes them very seriously. Too much maybe, some (very few) of them\nhave proven to be fake. A major incident is immediately deformed by people like\n@pamelageller and @rabbischmuley. Apparently, @cnn is not even capable to run google\ntranslate on a random french paper to confront them.<p>Recently a &quot;grand Paris&quot; project has been voted. If you see the map, almost a whole departement (county) has been left out except from the transportation for Charles de Gaulle Airport. Also, Minister of education accepts unqualified teachers for the same departement. That&#x27;s a sad choice, and 20 years down the roads, we will blame the victims. We had institutions that worked and are slowly dismantling them.<p>As tourist, you can eat cheap and good in ethnic places. In touristic places, usually neither.<p>Unlike some americans and their stars and stripes, French people don&#x27;t have a French flag on their windows. They know about their past in the colonies. But breeding racist in the name of security works pretty well here too. When the rich need people redirect their frustration. nothing beats an internal enemy. And it&#x27;s cheaper than to wage war outside.\nNot much left of the &quot;Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité&quot;. People don&#x27;t know about Ayn Rand here. She is winning anyway.\nBut when I hear about France on the american media, I have no fucking idea of what fantasmed country they are talking about.",1430855718

I was hoping that I&#x27;d be talking with folks doing interesting things or helping fledging developers on a solid path. You do get that (and it is wonderful when it happens), however most of what it seems to be is `do my homework for me`, `fix my old jquery site`, and stackoverflow type questions answered in realtime. Overall, it has been a positive experience but just not exactly what I expected. I believe in what they are doing and expect things to improve over time if the brand can be grown.<p>Lastly, there does seem to be a mindset of `I want a stellar developer to talk with but don&#x27;t truly value their time` (e.g. the $10 for 15 minutes of their time you mentioned). Not always the case, but it is definitely not common to see freelancing type rates. So, you end up donating your time, which isn&#x27;t always possible to do from a fiscal standpoint.",1430855514

9494538,comment,9493093,9494132,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"No it doesn&#x27;t. There are certainly some weird coincidences that are worthy of further investigation. But in any dramatic news event that touches the lives of a lot of people, there tend to be some weird coincidences. Many of them turn out to mean nothing at all. While one shouldn&#x27;t dismiss things on that basis - because the fact that something seems highly improbable may <i>well</i> mean it is worthy of further scrutiny - one shouldn&#x27;t uncritically accept them as fact on the mere basis of their improbability.<p>Look at the Germanwings plane crash that happened recently. At first a <i>lot</i> of people were convinced that the action had been carried out by radical Islamists, because such people have a track record of that sort of activity and terrorism in general in recent years.When it turned out to be a white German guy, some people were sure that he was a recent convert to Islam or something - which was a possibility worthy of consideration but not of certitude. When it further turned out that he was a neurotic and depressed guy going through anxiety about his eyesight and the impact that it might have on his career, a few of the people who really really believed int he Islamic terrorist idea started talking about how it was a big cover-up. It&#x27;s possible they&#x27;re right, but it&#x27;s much more likely that they&#x27;re just imagining it.<p>I agree that it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> that this is a false flag operation. The French security services have crossed the line into unethical behavior on previous occasions. There&#x27;s also a high degree of xenophobia in French culture for various socioeconomic reasons, and in difficult economic times (like now) it&#x27;s certainly more politically convenient to whip up anxiety about wicked foreigners than to take up the politically unpalatable task of structural reform. Thus, the motivation to carry out false flag operations certainly exist.<p>But motivation isn&#x27;t evidence. Otherwise you could take my bank statements and say &#x27;oh, you had a mediocre economic situation lately, I guess you had motivation to rob that bank last week, didn&#x27;t you? <i>Didn&#x27;t you?!</i>&#x27; And so on. It&#x27;s good to be skeptical and examine inconsistencies or oddities in the way news stories are reported. But reasoning from the existence of such things to a firm conclusion about what happened can be just as misleading as unquestioning acceptance of claims by authority figures. For one thing, it depends on the false premise that people in authority never make stupid mistakes, so that if they say something which later turns out not to be true, it must be because they were lying. In fact, people in authority are just as prone to jumping to conclusions, making mistakes, forgetting things, and saying whatever bullshit they think people want to hear as everyone else. So while they sometimes do lie, you should at least consider the possibility of simple incompetence first.<p>Don&#x27;t fall into the trap of swapping one kind of credulity for another.",1430855495

If I know it will prefer existing to not existing, I predict it will seek the resources to continue existing.

9494457,comment,9492049,9492049,0,0,exelius,,,"This highlights a number of problems with our public education system in general. I think the problems with the SAT highlighted in the article are reacting to these problems, not the other way around as the author seems to suggest.<p>* There is no standardized high school curriculum across schools, and even when curriculum is standardized, it is taught unevenly. It&#x27;s hard to have a college entrance exam that covers a significant amount of content as a result, because it puts kids from poor areas at a huge disadvantage in even getting in to college. It&#x27;s also very hard to identify which students are from good schools and which are from bad ones, so adjusting test scores to compensate isn&#x27;t a solution.<p>* Teacher-student ratios in public schools do not lend themselves to the kind of one-on-one work it takes to become a good writer. Unless we&#x27;re prepared to say &quot;you have a better chance getting in to college because you went to a suburban school district&quot;, this can&#x27;t be a huge part of the test. Writing ability as a high school senior is largely correlated to the amount of attention you got from your English teacher. If you&#x27;re a good student in a bad school, you probably get very little attention because you&#x27;re not acting up.<p>* There&#x27;s already too much &quot;teach to the test&quot; as it is. Making the SAT yet another test where students have to cram and memorize content is not the solution.<p>There are plenty of standardized tests that cover content. The problem is that they are far too basic for college entrance purposes. Turning the SAT into a content-focused test does not solve a problem that colleges have; many colleges are not looking for the best students, but for a racially-diverse selection of the most teachable students. What schools should do (and many already do) is require students from lower quality schools to take a semester of remedial classes free of charge to get them up to speed with whatever the base assumption of prior knowledge is at that school.",1430854590

If yes, you make that hire your de facto Director of Security and have them own the security ramping up process for your company. This includes doing penetration tests and assessments on your entire infrastructure, instituting policies for everything from audits to incident response, being the security arm of your software architecture going forward, and educating the rest of the development team about how to find the most common issues in their own code. This person will also facilitate the reviews of everyone&#x27;s code before it hits production, recruiting a team of security engineers if/when you&#x27;re big enough, and so on.<p>If you&#x27;re not able to hire that person yet, you have to do it yourself. This involves hiring an outside consultancy and a responsible disclosure program. It also means you&#x27;ll have to get training for your development team to learn basic security for their own software until you can afford a full-time security engineer. Outside consultancies are more expensive in the long run, and not as comprehensive as in-house unless you can afford to have them go at everything on retainer (most companies will only pay for them to audit big feature releases, and ignore technical debt and small/medium pushes to production).<p>Let&#x27;s say you have to do this yourself and don&#x27;t quite have the money for a consultancy or a security engineer yet. You&#x27;ll want to get acquainted with all the common security errors in web and mobile applications. Read <i>The Web Application Hacker&#x27;s Handbook.</i> It should be the only book you need, unless you want to specialize in infosec. As a developer, this will help you find almost all the problems you&#x27;re likely to commit in modern web development.<p>Next, make a responsible disclosure program. Don&#x27;t offer money just yet, because you aren&#x27;t necessarily expert enough to assess real security reports from invalid ones that are just looking for easy money.<p>2. When - as often as your software development life cycle allows you to. You implement regular, consistent, rigorous methodologies like peer-reviewing source code and ensure that every piece of code is checked before being pushed to production. Likewise, every feature release is checked before being pushed to production. Every time code is scheduled to hit production, you do a security audit.<p>You also do thorough audits of your technical debt, i.e. everything that was released >6 months ago and is still maintained in your infrastructure. This is to be done monthly, if you have an internal team, less frequently if not.<p>Again, if you don&#x27;t have full-time staff to focus exclusively on security, you&#x27;ll be paying someone else to do it, and you&#x27;ll want to prioritize feature releases.<p>I&#x27;m on the AppSec team at Accuvant LABS.

Show them how to be self reliant in terms of finding answers for themselves (important for any development career).  Address the commonly neglected area of interpersonal networking and personal branding (I can&#x27;t believe I just used that phrase with a straight face, but there it is).<p>But it seems like it was geared toward people who already had a handle on programming.  This, along with inflated marketing promises (welcome to the business world) is where things collapsed.<p>These are fixable problems.  First, time should be split between instruction on concrete beginner level topics and the project.  Preferably relevant to the task they will be tackling in the project itself.  The instructor should be very well versed in the technologies at least so far as the previously solved project the students build is concerned.  The project itself and the steps needed to accomplish the project should be very well understood.  The instructor should have a step by step guide from start to finish.  This would take doing the project from scratch a few times using the notes from the previous one as a guide.  That guide shouldn&#x27;t be shared with the developers but it should serve as a reference to get them unstuck after beating their head against Google and Stack Overflow.<p>And, of course, you shouldn&#x27;t make promises of employment that you can&#x27;t keep.<p>Now, those seem to be very core problems but I do see the logic behind a lot of the rest.  Exercise is important to work into your routine.  Networking is important.  Learning to solve your own problems is important.  Working with others is important.  Doing promo photoshoots and locking your laptop?  Not so much.<p>I can see why this person would want their money back and if I were Coding House I&#x27;d pay it, but I don&#x27;t think everything is as damning as this letter makes out.

These things happen from time to time and must be planned for properly (insure/self-insure and don&#x27;t freak out), or you risk emotional and financial bankruptcy. This takes some doing. My dad can handle this risk and he is a very happy and successful farmer. I can&#x27;t. I&#x27;m a very happy programmer.",1430853448

Also if this gets implemented then good luck for the future when Marie Le Pen&#x27;s far right government gains further power in this economy (and they will because France is doing too little too late to recover from the mess they&#x27;re in).<p>Also the standardization body (ETSI) which does a lot of the global technical specs (3gpp) for mobile and M2M is keeping quiet on the topic of building privacy into the standards. I have brought up the lack of privacy focus in several work groups but somehow this is not a topic that gets addressed at all. Mentioned chairmen are of course deeply ingrained in the telco industry which again is in bed with government.

We&#x27;ve had one complaint in five years, and that was because someone had a security system which thought our system&#x27;s behavior resembled some known attack.<p>About once a month, we check back with each site to see if their name or address changed.  We look at no more than 20 pages per site (if we haven&#x27;t found the business address looking in the obvious places, a human wouldn&#x27;t have either). So the traffic is very low.  Most scraper-oriented sites hit sites a lot harder than that, enough to be annoying.<p>We&#x27;ve seen some scraper blocking. We launch up to 3 HTTP requests to the same site in parallel. A few sites used to refuse to respond if they receive more than three HTTP requests in 10 seconds. That seems to have stopped, though; with some major browsers now using look-ahead fetching, that&#x27;s become normal browser behavior. More sites are using &quot;robots.txt&quot; to block all robots other than Google, but it&#x27;s under 1% of the several million web sites we examine.  We&#x27;re not seeing problems from using our own user-agent string.<p>So I&#x27;d suggest 1) obey &quot;robots.txt&quot;, 2) use your own user agent string that clearly identifies you, and 3) don&#x27;t hit sites very often.

There is a huge swathe of programming that can get by day-to-day using nothing more than arrays and hashtables.  And, all else being equal, in my experience this work is consistently done much better by people who can understand and reason through what is going on in a slightly more complex data structure, or describe the function of a recursive algorithm, etc.   Completely avoidable design errors are often made by people ignorant of why what they were doing was algorithmically silly or using inappropriate data structures.  This is often all so avoidable.<p>I was very explicit that I don&#x27;t think you should give &quot;brain teasers&quot; and expect people to &quot;perform&quot; them in an interview.

And I&#x27;m not going to ask anyone to implement one from scratch on a board, but I might show you an implementation and ask you what your thoughts on testing and corner cases to analyse would be.<p>These are perfectly applicable questions (perhaps excepting entry level), and vastly more relevant than how a TLB works, which was my point.

The dog circled my property, and then barked at the fence, so the cops kicked my gate down and searched my back yard.

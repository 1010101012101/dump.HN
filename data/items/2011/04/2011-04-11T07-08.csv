If the numbers of applications rumoured are right and you got about 1800, and each form takes on average 2 people-days to complete then as a community we put in 10 years effort just to apply. That's 10 years that for the majority of us could've been put to better use into our companies/ideas instead so it would be nice if we could just get a little back in return to help us be better next time round.<p>If you really want to differentiate yourself from the pack (and I think you probably do) then do something that no-one else does. Give feedback. For the sake of a few people days extra effort your end it would come back to you a hundred times over in other ways.<p>I'm sure you have a process for sorting the wheat from the chaff but here's what I would do if I were wearing your shoes:<p><pre><code>   1. First pass have two buckets - MAYBEs and NOs. For all the NOs have someone writing down one sentence of why they're a no and include in their rejection letter (via a mail merge off a CSV)
   2. Second pass go through the MAYBEs. For all the NOs this time round answer two questions:
               1. What went well (with their application)?
               2. Even better if (their application had/said/was/included ...)?
</code></pre>
Two/three bullet points for each question would be amazing for us and you'd probably find yourself repeating. You will also probably find it will help generate content for your general feedback document and guides.<p>Hope my feedback is seen as just that rather than criticism. I love you guys but feedback is an essential part of the learning process and one that I just can't help asking for whenever I see an opportunity!",1302508561

I've seen quite a few visual environments where at the end of the day (once you've learned the language) it was faster to switch to text mode. Visual programming was great for learning the language though.<p>The main problem visual programming encounters is the sheer number of options you have when you are entering code in text form.<p>Just consider that on almost any new line in code you can type in control structure, variable declaration, assignment, function/method call etc. And it is almost always faster to type ""if"" or ""for"" than to click through some decision tree to get to your required command.<p>In touchqode we try to overcome this limitation using prefix tree when showing code suggestions - e.g. when you have methods showTime(), showDate() and showLocation() you can type ""s"", press ""tab"" and you see longest common prefixes of methods starting ""s"" - so you would see ""show"". Then you can click it and see the actual method names.<p>Needless to say - templates for structured commands (e.g. ""if"") are probably necessary for programming on mobile devices.<p>I have few experimental features for touch programming in my mind, so I hope I'll get to implementing them sooner than later. If anyone has interesting ideas I'll be glad to discuss them.",1302508152

In mathematics it's not that uncommon to find self-taught people, though it still isn't the norm. But overall not many people do it. Why will people do so now? Just because the material can be accessed without going to a library? Given that it takes some effort to work your way through a 4-year physics program, was the effort of going to the library to pick up Griffiths/Feynman/Landau really the main bottleneck?<p>I can definitely buy some change on the margins and in poorer countries (people who had no access to a library), but I'm confused why the internet will mean that people who for decades have not been teaching themselves physics, despite the books being available, will now do so.",1302507281

I think quality startups will want to reach a certain level (prototype, proof of concept) and then money will find them. The blanket offer for investment without knowing the startups or prior relationships is a bit too good to be true?",1302505595

To me iOS seems utterly stagnant and my Android phone surpassed my iPhone in every way from the second I got it.<p>Not trying to provoke a flamewar or anything, just wondering if there is something I'm missing here and on what basis this argument is made.",1302505582

In Germany, universities and therefore higher education is free. You just enroll, take classes, pay your rent and after a couple of years, you are done and usually have a degree that is very competitive around the world.<p>But every student knows that there are areas that lead to high-paying jobs such as engineering, while in other areas such as history, communications, philosophy, languages, you will have trouble finding a job, not even speaking of a high-paying job. Still, people are usually more or less aware of the fact that they might end up having an average-income job.<p>In the US, higher education is a financial investment where people expect a financial return. In Germany, higher education is mostly an investment of time and people are much more aware of the possible outcomes. We don't have a bubble here.",1302505337

Trying out solar, wind, raising animals, growing with intensive raised beds, etc. But I don't think they expect to be completely self-sufficient, in the short-term anyway. I think they're fairly realistic that their entire community isn't set up that way at this point (good points about what it takes to supply solar, wind, etc). Tim, the farm's owner, is also trying experiments in more sustainable city living (for more, I did a video on his small town green highrise going up in Chapel Hill, NC <a href=""http://faircompanies.com/videos/view/a-small-town-green-high-rise/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faircompanies.com/videos/view/a-small-town-green-high...</a>",1259269113

Afterwards I started working with a doctor to try and find a ritalin replacement that didn't include the daily emotional roller coaster that came with Ritalin.<p>After 7 or 8 meds I found that Provigil (Modafinil) is flipping awesome.  It has no side effects, and is milder but more consistent than Ritalin. I don't get hyper-focused like with ritalin, which is great because it doesn't make me get hyper-focused on the wrong task. I can easily coax my brain back on task when distracted now.",1259268278

963073,comment,962928,962928,0,0,pg,,,"The argument here is in effect that no vernacular variant of any language could possibly embody a mistake.  Which is true  for some definitions of mistake, and false for others.<p>The problem with the definitions that make it true is that there's a slippery slope from dialects to idiolects.  How many people have to speak a dialect for it to count as a dialect?  You can't have any threshold, or you get weird consequences in hypothetical cases, like all the speakers of a dialect dying off except one.  So if you decide that no vernacular can embody mistakes, you're bound to conclude that nothing any individual does can be a mistake, so long as they do it consistently.",1259266997

In the same style, when walking to a cliff and switching hats (to get to the green one) you enthusiastically run into the cliff the moment you equip the pink hat.<p>- having two different jump buttons with the green hat is confusing. It's also not consistent with the pink hat. The pink hat makes you run even if you don't press c, but the green hat doesn't ""upgrade"" your normal jump with x.<p>- I haven't been able to figure out what the yellow (music?) hat is for.<p>- I only discovered by accident that you can use the dead bodies of the bigger enemies as plateau.<p>- touching the spikes with a toe kills you instantly. Not very forgiving.<p>- it took me a few levels to figure out that you have to walk _past_ a door to trigger it, that standing in front of it and hitting some keys doesn't work.<p>- having to switch quickly to the right hat can be frustrating. Especially if you see enemies approaching from both sides and you accidentally cycle past the blue hat.<p>- I got stuck on the level where you have to scare one of the big guys into a cliff with the red hat. I can stand on the body, but I can't make the jump to the exit because the avatar either hits his head on the ceiling or doesn't jump far enough. I suspect there's some kind of floating ability I missed. Hrm.<p>Nice game though. Congrats!",1265066457

1093754,comment,1091814,1093480,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> I'm arguing, simply, that the RIAAs lawsuits are chock full of injustice: a flawed core conceit (that IP addresses can identify individuals), lawbreaking (unlicensed PIs) and piles of collateral damage (file-sharing grandmothers?).<p>The problem I have with this argument is that, despite all the legal chicanery, the chances are that most people the RIAA are going after really <i>did</i> do it. I understand the desire not to punish the innocent, and the reaction of the public when such stories make the headlines, but don't forget the other perspective: big media companies may adopt naive policies in an attempt to reduce piracy, but the guys running them are staring at 10 people, knowing that 9 of them are ripping them off, and listening to lawyers telling them they can't have any money back because no-one can prove to some practically unachievable degree of certainty who the 10th is.<p>> It's that I see no evidence that the public is particularly motivated by injustice to seek change.<p>This is a big problem with a lot of legal issues relating to modern technology and the new abilities it gives us. The implications of fundamental shifts like having the Internet or being able to store and analyse vast quantities of data probably won't be fully understood even by interested parties or expert observers for several years.<p>The average guy on the street will probably never appreciate some of the subtleties in any given area of law, even if it does affect him, because unfortunately people don't always think things through and research the facts before forming opinions. For example, how many people in any given copyright debate on a geek-friendly forum will ignore the fact that big business is mostly owned by institutional investors who run things like pension funds?<p>Mass copyright infringement is not a ""victimless crime"", and it doesn't just hurt ""those big studios who were ripping us off for years"". It hurts people's savings accounts, and pension funds, because when profits are reduced at the big media companies, the values of the investments goes down. At this point, someone traditionally trots out the old ""illegal copy != lost sale"" argument, again invoking something that while true some of the time is clearly not true of a lot of illegal ripping. And so the argument continues, with the critics using individual cases that appeal to emotional responses, wilfully ignoring the big picture because it's ""just greedy businesses taking the hit, not real people"".<p>This is why it is important for laws to be made by people who <i>have</i> spent the time to look at the facts, think through the implications, and then adopt a policy that is consistent with principles the general public support when fully aware of the implications. But it is then incumbent on those who make the laws to justify them on demand to a sceptical public, and right now this is where the copyright brigade are failing miserably.",1265065885

This is possible in any dynamic language that has functions as first-class variables such as Python.

    Here's an overview of the download process:
    
    A. The big brown button first checks to see if
    your machine has Digital Editions already.
           If not, it will ask you if you want to
           install it.
           If you have an older version, it will ask
           if it can update your version.
    
    B. The first time Digital Editions is opened, it
    will ask you to ""Authorize"" your computer. It
    wants you to associate your machine with an Adobe
    ID. If you don't have an Adobe ID, you can choose
    the small ""get an Adobe ID online"" link to set one
    up. (It's free.) Some people already have Adobe
    IDs, from using Photoshop or other Adobe products.
    
    Here's why to authorize: If you authorize your
    computer with an Adobe ID, you will be able to
    open the same book file on up to five other
    computers or devices authorized to the same Adobe
    ID. If you choose ""Don't Authorize,"" your book
    file will only be able to live on the first
    machine it opens on; it can't be moved elsewhere.
    
    C. The last step is book delivery--there's a very
    small file, called URLLink.acsm, that needs to be
    downloaded to your computer. When it opens in
    Digital Editions, it will launch your electronic
    book.</code></pre>",1265065315

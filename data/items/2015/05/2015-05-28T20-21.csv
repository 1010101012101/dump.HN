It’s a deeply flawed programming methodology, and I wasted a good five years of my programming life thinking that it was useful, and I’ll never get that back. If I had been able to tell 18-year-old me to stick with compression-oriented programming, I probably would be a much better programmer today and I would have made decent code in my 18 to 23-years old period instead of the garbage OOP code that I ended up making.

9621118,comment,9617268,9620878,0,0,duaneb,,,"> How come every recorded or reconstructed earlier version of every language spoken today is more complex than the contemporary version?<p>This is a) not true, b) the transition to writing has a large effect on the language, not the contact with the western world, and c) I suspect you meant &quot;analytic&quot;/&quot;syntactic&quot; rather than &quot;simple&quot;/&quot;complex&quot;. Neither is strictly more complex than the other, although syntactic languages typically require memorizing more forms.<p>A few notes. First, analytic languages seem simpler but require just as much understanding of how the words interact; this learning is not typically reflected in terms of memorization. Second, there is no obvious complexity gradient at ALL—even in languages that appear to drop &quot;features&quot;, it&#x27;s typically because of absorption and/or emergence of other features. For example, look at english—some parts are very &quot;simple&quot;, but the language as a whole is about as complex as it gets and is NOT easy to learn. In contrast, a highly syntactic language (e.g. most early PIE languages—polyphonic greek, sanskrit, classical latin) seems more complex because so much memorization is necessary to use features together, but the lack of irregularities through loan words compensate.<p>In addition, it&#x27;s far easier to learn complex forms by listening rather than writing. IMHO syntactic languages get a bad rep because of this.",1432846523

It&#x27;s clear that consensus has issues at scale, but a more fair analysis might include some settings and constraints where modern consensus-based decision making also does pretty well.<p>For instance, with large, disparate groups of people intending to accomplish something ambitious, things are bound to get hairy no matter what process you use, and all things considered, the consensus process is probably not helping much or the best choice to use. The article is full of examples of this.<p>On the other hand, for small-ish groups of people, who aren&#x27;t trying to pull off any major new projects, but are instead more interested in maintaining some sort of infrastructure and taking on smaller tasks, my experience has been that formal consensus is pretty great.  You might argue that almost any process works with a small group of people... if that&#x27;s your experience, well, maybe you spend time with less ornery and headstrong people than I do.<p>Living with people is a great example of where consensus can work really well. For small-ish groups, where everyone has to (literally) live with the decision, and especially with the other people who made it, my experience was that the formal consensus process was a pretty great way to ensure that no one felt left out, harbored silent resentment, etc.<p>When we used a consensus-based process to run a collectively-owned co-op where fourteen or so of us lived, it was pretty great.  It didn&#x27;t necessarily lead to more optimal decisions (though it often did), but it did lead to me realizing that theoretical optimality isn&#x27;t nearly as important to most people as feeling that their voice is being heard, and feeling included in the process.<p>Obvious caveats of good faith etc apply, but in practice, it was rarely an issue.",1432846266

Same for error handling. At least 2 people on the record, including Rob Pike said no new feature will be added to the language.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean you should stop asking for them, but it ultimately means that people wanting generics and other features in Go should consider a fork<p>Forks are ALWAYS healthy, the nodejs/iojs story is yet another proof of it. The thing people wanted (iojs) has won over the original project, which forced nodejs merge iojs back.<p>Like many I personally think Go isn&#x27;t striking the right balance between minimalism and features. People who are against generics are in favor of trading compile time type checking(which is always safe) for run time type assertions(which can fail). But they refuse to acknowledge that fact. That&#x27;s what make their argument against generics wrong and will ultimately damage any potential growth for the language.They are basically working against their own interests.",1432845976

But part of the crushing burden of poverty is that it prevents you from making good investments.

No one really knows, and that&#x27;s why this is such a big debate. So many people realize that this is one of the most pressing issues of the 21st century. How are we going to develop a compromise or solution that handles automation-related jobs loss and inequality.

There has also been some work done in economics on agency issues in corporations (looting by managers, in particular, especially focused on the savings and loan crisis in the US in the late &#x27;80&#x27;s or early &#x27;90&#x27;s).<p>Sociologists and criminologists have done a little work on different kinds of collective organization, but no one has attempted any kind of grand cover of all the different ideas and structures humans have employed to solve the problem of getting stuff done in groups of more than a few close friends and family, which includes but is not limited to:<p>1) military organizations  
2) churches and monastaries  
3) town corporations  
4) craft guilds

The disasters of the total state in the 20th century were essentially possible because no one could prove they wouldn&#x27;t work, and while we are somewhat better off in that regard today there is still an enormous amount of work to be done, to the extent that I think the problem really needs its own field of study, rather than being scattered across economics, business, politics, sociology and history.<p>[1] It manages to be both accurate and carricature because the real thing is as genuinely grotesque as what you describe.

What was just &quot;rural poverty&quot; (of course, half the country was still rural) in 1925 became more widespread by 1927-28 (noticeable slipping demand for consumer products) and finally was recognized as a Great Depression after it tanked the stock market in 1929-32.<p>We have, in 2015, a <i>lot</i> of ill-managed prosperity.

Science&#x27;s core value is empiricism, NOT rationalism. Empiricism and rationalism are at odds with one another and make incompatible claims.<p>>I&#x27;m just the same; I don&#x27;t pretend to have a deep and detailed understanding of quantum physics, but I accept it as true because I believe at least that an internally consistent external world exists and a global conspiracy of physicists doesn&#x27;t. If you quizzed me, at some level of detail I&#x27;d have to start guessing. My incorrect guesses shouldn&#x27;t be mistaken for intentional rejection of established theories.<p>This is one of the weakest epistemic arguments I&#x27;ve ever heard. But also very honest.<p>You&#x27;re basically saying that your central ontological conviction is that a group of humans called physicists are the ontological authorities, but you can&#x27;t actually tell us what ontology it is that those authorities advocate, but whatever it is, you&#x27;re sure they&#x27;re right and their opponents are wrong.<p>This is a brutally honest admission: most fans of science have no idea what science is actually saying and couldn&#x27;t survive a brief cross-examination of their &quot;scientific&quot; worldview. They would keep getting tripped up and go back to &quot;I agree with what Joe says, and even though I can&#x27;t explain what it is that Joe says, I am sure he is right and you are wrong, and I&#x27;m sure that Joe would have great arguments to defeat you with.&quot;<p>Of course, this is an illogical argument and completely fails. If you can&#x27;t describe the position of the authority (PoA) that you trust in, then you can&#x27;t compare the position of the authority (PoA) to the position of others (PoO).<p>If you don&#x27;t know PoA, then you don&#x27;t know that PoO is not equal to PoA. You can&#x27;t, on your own, determine if PoA == PoO or if PoA != PoO. Since you can&#x27;t make this comparison, you can&#x27;t make any argument at all and can&#x27;t make any meaningful statements about PoO. You can&#x27;t even claim that someone&#x27;s argument conflicts with your authority&#x27;s argument, because it&#x27;s impossible to know that PoA != PoO when you don&#x27;t know what PoA is.<p>The only epistemic position you are left with is to robotically repeat the profession of the faith:<p><i>&quot;There is no truth but physics and physicists are that truth&#x27;s prophets.&quot;</i><p>Most self-proclaimed atheists are in the same boat as you, but far less aware of their ignorance of their own doctrines.<p>Most atheists totally fail to articulate an internally consistent scientism, and also fail to articulate a scientism that is compatible with the scientism that physicists articulate.<p>Again and again they fall back on <i>&quot;the prophet is right, but I don&#x27;t know what he is right about.&quot;</i><p>Their ontology and epistemology is a &quot;I&#x27;ll believe what they&#x27;re believing&quot; kind of finger-pointing.<p>So now you see why philosophers like me think &quot;New Atheists&quot; are anti-intellectuals--and why we have criticized New Atheists of having the same religious ignorance and fervor that is common among Christians.

The second is dealing with recursive data-structures or algorithms.

        ...

            let values = unsafe { ::std::mem::transmute::<&Vec<Value>, &&#x27;a Vec<Value>>(&values) };

We grew up knowing which cops to stay far, far away from, and to never let yourself get into police custody. You just didn&#x27;t hear about it then because people didn&#x27;t have cameraphones and the Internet.<p>A friend of a friend was pulled through a screen door and beaten until she miscarried by her ex-boyfriend cop, he was moved to the nex town over. An artist college student was shot dead by a cop who saw the building door open and went inside and just executed him (he was literally on the phone when it happened so we know it was unprovoked.) A person in my church was arrested for domestic abuse, his family had a fire sale in the family business to get the money to bail him out, and the police STOLE 10,000 dollars from them in a civil forfeiture when they pulled over his brother on the way to the jail with the cash, so he stayed in jail and their business went under. They were all white.<p>This shit has been happening for DECADES and the irony of people whining that this happens because nobody cares about blacks is that NOBODY IN THE MEDIA GAVE A SHIT until recently when it could be framed as a racial issue.",1432844861

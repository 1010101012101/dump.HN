Doubly so in code where there's no ""right"" output to test for: as in the case of any non-optimal optimization function.<p>I agree in principle, but your example is off.  Optimization is testable, and even provable.  If your optimizers doesn't rely on ad-hoc techniques, you can also usually give an estimate of how far away your solution is from the true optimum.",1317740373

And, I think that (unintentionally?) pg and the YC partners have modeled a lot of YC around an Ivy League model.<p>The question that I'm interested in with Hackers & Founders, is how do we teach thousands of engineers how to build great products, and once doing that, how to you help them build great startups, and then how to you help those founders turn around and be serial entrepreneurs.<p>Tons of VC's that I talk to tend to turn up their nose at our community, and proceed to tell me, ""Send me your Rock Stars"".<p>My question to them, is... ""Where do rock star entrepreneurs come from?  Do they descend from heaven on a cloud like Mark Zuckerberg?

No clue.<p>I'm really interested in having H&F, and all the grass roots startup communities that we partner with around the globe be a support system to failing entrepreneurs.

Turns out that no vendors care to test with any other vendors. Turns out that everything is in some state of brokeness and the only sane solution is to limit complexity and variety and focus on x amount of technologies that we have time to test and make work.<p>This is why you get a PC without admin rights, set to autoupdate, with our default image, our security policies, and our unpopular defaults (IE9 in my case) but with an option for chrome for those who request it.<p>I have no idea how home users get by.  I hear about their problems and its sounds like a nightmare of poorly written default (your average home laptop is a minefield of OEM junk and a malware magnet).  I suspect this is why Apple is doing so well. They abstract away the complexity and actually make their products compatible with their OS and other offerings! Toss in the fact that OSX isn't as targetted by malware, and I can see the allure. On the corporate side, linux is the same deal. We all are comfortable with the command line tools we learned in high school/college/whenever and they haven't changed. Its like an old friend.

How about the <i>users</i>? I don't buy the ""it will stall innovation"" argument. Having Linux be free didn't stall innovation, quite the opposite. I'd even say without it being free, we wouldn't be where we are now in regards to innovation. Large companies would still be in control. I know many companies depending on Linux, Firefox, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, Flash, Apache, BIND, OpenOffice, irssi, Postfix; and the many innovations these free products provided and facilitated. If I think about the projects that weren't out to make money, but to do something good, the value of free software becomes even greater.<p>But at the base of it all: For some of us technology is still more about solutions and making life better, rather than just money.

There are certainly stupider things we spend 8% of the federal budget on.<p>And in any case, one purpose is to be a replacement for the current piecemeal programs we have, which aren't cheap to begin with. Food stamps + Section 8 + EITC currently costs about $150 billion per year, plus some additional amount in bureaucracy and litigation due to complex rules, plus some additional economic damage caused by market distortion due to the fact that food stamps + section 8 aren't normal cash (EITC is better for that). That leaves maybe $100-150b, some of which is probably also redundant with existing welfare programs (I just picked three big ones), or about 3-4% of the federal budget.<p>If you want to keep it budget-neutral, how about an across-the-board 3-4% cut to all other budget categories in return? Or, we could just, as you point out, remove the temporary ""overseas contingency operations"" (Iraq/Afghanistan wars) supplement to the regular DoD budget, which is $125b in 2012, returning the DoD to its baseline budget. If I had a line-item veto pen I could pretty easily come up with another few hundred billion in savings if you'd like (cut agriculture subsidies, cut Medicare Part D, transition TSA/air-traffic-control to being fully user-fee-funded, do another round of domestic military-base closures through a BRAC-like process, etc., etc.). :)",1317739453

Touring and new media are things artists have control over to a much larger extent and that's where artists should be focused.<p>If a good independent label wants to pick you up, like say Bella Union or Merge or Sub Pop (still) or the like then go for it, it might help. Or it might not. For some it's a big deal, but mostly in terms of promotion and profile, better tours. The good labels, like Bella Union, get very involved in that side of it, others not so much. Even then those lucky acts that are on good labels are still primarily touring bands, and downloads and sales and royalties are a small percentage of their income, unless something really breaks on radio, and that my friend is <i>whole other ballgame</i> and extremely rare from the average artists' perspective. Better to hope to get on a TV show or film, raise your profile some and get better tours.<p>Also, most of the time those higher-profile independent labels came along and were interested because those acts already had something going, some sales, regional numbers or whatnot that made the label relationship more like a partnership.<p>It helps to go into it from a position of strength, where you know you can walk away. And if you can walk away, you might not even need the Independent label. Mostly you need good management and good promotion to get better tour numbers going, build into a position of strength and really think about what means of income are available to you in an age where access to distribution channels (the primary former attraction of labels) are now available to virtually everyone.",1317739447

Doesn't have to say that it has to be the front end service that talks to the end user web browser. The OP of the ""cancer"" article made up that shit. I can bind the listener of a node service to an UNIX Domain Socket and talk HTTP over that socket with a front end web server, instead of plain TCP (reduces the IPC latency). It is IPC between distinct components. It delegates the dynamic page generation to another service. It is a text interface, although sometimes, well, most of the times, the binary protocols outperform the text based protocols therefore the theory is crap. Isn't this ""UNIX way"" enough for some people? Forget the part that says: any IPC adds extra latency to the request - response paradigm aka the opposite of the stuff a web stack should do.<p>Can you tell me at least one example from the myriad xGI protocols for interfacing a web server with an application server that actually brings any benefit over having plain HTTP/1.1 and a reverse proxy? Does it help to have yet another protocol for doing basically the same task: IPC between a couple of servers? Any xGI client (aka web server) is basically a reverse proxy for an IPC protocol. Does it say somewhere, carved in stone, that this protocol must be other than HTTP? I think that most people that spend the time engineering yet another xGI solution simply don't see the forest for the trees.<p>PS: nobody stops anybody to drop a scgi.js or fastcgi.js module for node.js if that keeps people warm at night.

Many of us long term Perl programmers know well the dangers of TIMTOWTDI.

This has come specifically out of the Moose community and basically pushes to try and spread consistent best practices throughout the community.<p>I think the issue you encounter is a combination of isolation (the more involved you are in the community, the more you are exposed to best-practices and idiomatic Perl) and the quality of some of the older Perl documentation and books. In some of these older documents there was an emphasis put on ""cleverness through TIMTOWTDI"" which really had a damaging effect on some people (read: the people whose code you have inherited).<p>Perl is an extremely flexible language, which in the right hands can be very powerful.

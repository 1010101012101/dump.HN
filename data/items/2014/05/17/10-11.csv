That lets you keep the one-time password&#x27;s validity time short since you know when the subscriber sees the one-time password. The other is that it&#x27;s straightforward to require an interactive step, e.g. &quot;press 7 to get a code&quot;.<p>The interactive step makes an attack based on SMS forwarding harder. The short timeout makes an attack based on having limited access to a victim&#x27;s phone harder.<p>Not sure if the security improvements are worth the useability problems---people aren&#x27;t familiar with USSD and, because it&#x27;s not used as often, mobile terminal software for it is likely to be buggier.",1400324052

It makes white label handsets that operators can customize for local markets.</i><p>Technically this isn&#x27;t the case; MTK don&#x27;t make handsets themselves, they&#x27;re fabless and only provide reference designs based on their chipsets. It&#x27;s the innumerable Chinese OEMs that use these reference designs to make handsets. (See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek#.282013-present.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek#.282013-present.29</a> for a non-exhaustive list of smartphones that contain them.) Because it&#x27;s a reference design, most of them have very similar features, since OEMs don&#x27;t have to expend much effort to add features themselves. In fact I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s unusual to <i>not</i> have e.g. dual-SIM, expandable storage, FM radio, or removable battery in a MTK smartphone; they&#x27;re pretty much standard. The variation between models is mostly in ROM/RAM, camera and screen sizes, and case styling (there are models with small screens but the fastest SoC, for example.) Also, the MT6589 platform does <i>not</i> have 4G, it&#x27;s 3G.<p>MTK is certainly relatively unknown in North America but in Asia the situation is very different - you&#x27;ll find far more mention and phones using them, hardware-level repair/modding information is common, and they also cost significantly less than the flagships from Samsung, LG, and the other big companies.<p>Edit: looks like Wired covered this a year ago: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2013/02/mediatek/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2013/02/mediatek/</a><p>(I bought a generic 5&quot; MT6589 smartphone in China and have been quite satisfied with it.)",1400322509

The scale could make up for the difference.<p>Besides that, I think the ad market for such regions should not be understated. Especially in emerging economies, lots of companies will be competing for mindshare, both national and international.<p>Also, with respect to the Apple comment of the grandparent: I think that Apple has to do something at some point. Because it&#x27;s not only that there are good budget smartphones now, but you can also get excellent cutting edge smartphones around $300-400, such as the Nexus 5 and the Moto X.<p>An anecdote: but I was an iPhone user for 5 years, but when replacing my iPhone 4, the Nexus 4 was so much cheaper (299 Euro) than a new iPhone. And I don&#x27;t feel I lost any functionality. In fact, I can do a lot of things I couldn&#x27;t do before (attaching files from the e-mail app, forward notifications to desktop per PushBullet, assign different notification LED colors to different apps, etc.)",1400321376

7759741,comment,7759565,7759565,1,0,gajomi,,,"So I have seen many of these kinds of graphs and associated complaints that come with them. Much of the criticism revolves around the usefulness of ``popularity&#x27;&#x27; as a proxy for other things that we actually care about in programming languages having to do with their immediate usefulness to us. These are all good to discuss, but I think there is a more pressing issue, having to do with the granularity of the sample. I work in an area of scientific computing, and have 1-2 languages at any given time that I work with often, and have familiarity with 3-4 more. However, I have friends that work in slightly different areas of scientific computing that have a different set of languages. Integrating information from these people, I have a rough set of the languages used in my local neighborhood. And I will say there is actually quite a bit of diversity in the neighborhood, even though its all within scientific computing. So who is to say what lies in the realm of friend of a friend of a friend? I don&#x27;t have a feel for this distribution.<p>This is where I think integrating these kinds of graphs with a filtration over distances on some network would be highly useful. It is not clear which network(s) would be the best, but there are some clear advantages to going with induced link through github collaborations. What I am suggesting might be more helpful for niche domains than it would be for the ``median&#x27;&#x27; programmer (if such a thing exists), but who knows, maybe there is some usefulness there too?",1400321051

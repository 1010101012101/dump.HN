Someone should do a redesign like that guy did for the NSA slides[1].  I think the color palette is taking all of the spotlight away from the key technical updates.  Even though the updates are features that Android and WinMo users have had for a while, many iOS users are only getting these for the first time.  This is a first cut and there is still three months to clean it up.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://fr.slideshare.net/EmilandDC/dear-nsa-let-me-take-care-ou"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fr.slideshare.net/EmilandDC/dear-nsa-let-me-take-care...</a>",1370977166

Assume China cuts off shipping lanes in the Pacific.  They position their naval fleets in some aggressive formation over major lines (likely blockading Taiwan or something).  Assumedly, they have to sink a ship or at least fire shots and take one captive.  The U.S. and Japan respond by moving their forces into aggressive positions threatening China.  The situation either A. ends when China or the U.S. back down or B. accelerates into military conflict. The conflict is either small, likely involving only SEALs, drone/tactical strikes, or another group of special forces, or full scale, involving (initially) a Pacific strike group fleet.  The only logical progression of a full scale military conflict between two nuclear powers is nuclear warfare, at which point it won&#x27;t matter how big either standing army is.

Much of software has been moving to the cloud in recent years and most new devices can only work with cloud data.  You can&#x27;t even log into a chromebook, surface, android tablet, or iPad without registering with some online service and giving them your personal details.<p>If you want to write some software on these devices you have to use the device like a thin-client and be at the mercy of your internet connection and some cloud service (like online IDEs).  The platforms, for the most part, don&#x27;t allow much local work to be done.<p>They do all allow JavaScript and have some form of network connection and persistent storage.  By implementing git in pure javascript we&#x27;ll be able to build tools that work completely offline, peer-to-peer or, if desired, with cloud based systems.

We don’t even know how flawed our mental model is, let alone what our counter-surveillance actions actually achieve. As an example, the Tor network has only 3000 nodes, of which 1000 are exit nodes. Over a 24hr time period a connection will use approximately 10% of those exit nodes (under the default settings). If I were a gambling man, I’d wager money that there are at least 100 malicious Tor exit nodes doing passive monitoring. A nation state could double the number of Tor exit nodes for less than the cost of a smart bomb. A nation state can compromise enough ISPs to have monitoring capability over the majority of Tor entrance and exit nodes.<p>Other solutions are just as fragile, if not more so.<p>Basically, all I am trying to say is that the surveillance capability of the adversary (if you pick a nationstate for an adversary) exceeds the evasion capability of the existing public tools.

I am in the former group. (Now, obviously, there is a spectrum between the two ends but that&#x27;s besides the point)<p>For me, and the runners I train with, it&#x27;s not so much about the races but rather the experience of running itself.  When I run, I am in one of two states: Either intense concentration (if it&#x27;s a hard workout) or in a nice flow where my mind wanders and is occupied by interesting thoughts.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had the cliched &quot;Runner&#x27;s High&quot;, but perhaps this is it. I always end up feeling less stressed and more relaxed.  So this is probably why I run.<p>Those that don&#x27;t enjoy running probably don&#x27;t get this out of the act. It&#x27;s probably mind-numbingly boring, which is why many people are forced to listen to music.  The few times I&#x27;ve been injured and forced to use indoor cardiac equipment (like an elliptical), I&#x27;ve experience this sort of boredom.<p>Now, as to why the author was not informed of such delicate topics and &quot;runners&#x27; trot&quot;, I can only chalk it up to runners not wanting to bore &quot;normal&quot; people with details of their personal activities.  I can tell you that among runners, we&#x27;re more than candid about such topics, and most runners can remember fairly exacting details of races they&#x27;ve run.  They probably choose not to share such details with outsiders so that they don&#x27;t bore or annoy them to death with something they might not be interested in.  (As the author pointed out in the second paragraph - how they &quot;hate people who are constantly posting about running over on Facebook&quot;)<p>As for preventing it, nothing&#x27;s foolproof. Know when you usually have to &quot;go&quot;, and structure you runs accordingly. Try to keep a log of what you&#x27;ve eaten and draw inferences from that.

On the vast majority of consumer sound systems and consumer ears, as you point out, compressing that further into a 128kbs MP3 isn&#x27;t noticeable. For me it personally is, but on most music say 192VBR MP3 isn&#x27;t.<p>Currently at the end of the line all audio is going to be squished, at best, to 44k 16bit sampling. Most audio production and engineering is going to be taking place at quality levels than what the final CD master is, however.\n/During/ production working with higher quality sources such as a higher sample rate, higher bit rate FLAC sample means that you can &#x27;do more&#x27; with it before you start running into the walls of unintended artifacts and distortions. Think of all audio processing as a destructive process - the more you have to begin with the more you can do before the destruction becomes noticeable.<p>Intentionally ignoring all debates on aesthetics, obviously in many artistic circumstances the artifacts and distortions are desired - but when they are you can easily achieve them in an /intentional/ way. Avoiding them is the challenge.<p>And there are certain contexts in which it is more noticeable: high quality club sound-systems, custom home and car audio systems, etc. My vehicle&#x27;s sound system has a very easily audible difference between a 128KBS MP3 and an uncompressed 44k 16bit CD for most music, and in that context you are damn sure I want the uncompressed experience. So having an /option/ for high quality lossless formats such as FLAC available universally helps to serve such niche markets.<p>tldr; if you are in camp that can&#x27;t tell the difference, you shouldn&#x27;t download the higher quality larger files. They aren&#x27;t for you. Other camps do exist, however.<p>edit edit: And this all ignores the annoying &#x27;loudness war&#x27; trend in modern audio engineering to use compressors to flatten out all dynamic range anyway.

The rockets at the beginning pose an insurmountable challenge for most codecs. Last I checked, MP3 at any bitrate couldn&#x27;t do it, and Ogg Vorbis fell down unless you went up to at least -q7, which is a rather high bitrate (~224kbps).",1370973659

START TLS goes a long way, but providing the same signals about message authenticity to people who IMAP from gmail as who use the web UI would be nice.<p>A non-google-trusting way to do PGP with a better UI/UX would also be a nice feature for gmail.  Just indicating &quot;encrypted&quot; at the message-list view or something.  I have PGP working quite nicely in mutt, but a lot of people seem to prefer webmail.<p>2. I&#x27;d actually prefer a world where signals intelligence, outside extremely tactical intelligence, were impossible through technical means.  I think we&#x27;ll be there at some point, just because the cost of protection is dropping.<p>(confidentiality and message integrity <i>should</i> be feasible for any reasonable government defender at this point.  traffic analysis/direction finding/etc. burns bandwidth and latency budgets, so that might be harder, but you can do arbitrarily well.)<p>The US (government and citizens/private industry) probably has more to gain from universally strong COMSEC vs. effective USG SIGINT.",1370973631

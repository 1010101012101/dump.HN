2087542,comment,2086830,2087175,0,0,jinushaun,,,"The problem with the hidden menu in Android is that Google set a precedent of bad UX by hiding <i>primary tasks</i> in the menu. It's ok to put secondary tasks in a context menu, but primary tasks should be visible at the top level. Desktops have the same problem with putting too much functionality in the right click context menu. <p>It's like making a painting app where the only way to paint is to select the brush and colors from a context menu. Or making a web browsers where the only way to navigate back and forth or change the address is via a context menu. Or a tabbed text editor where the only way to switch files is via a context menu. You don't have to be an Apple fanboi to agree that that is just bad UX. People who disagree are probably developers and developers should not be designing UX. That's why open source programs have notoriously bad UX.<p>Fortunately, Google recognizes this problem and is fixing this I newer versions of their apps. For example, you can now finally locate yourself in the Map app without going to the menu.",1294635570

This is especially true for strategy games like starcraft that make heavy use of the CPU.<p>As time moves on, I do imagine the ability to run x86 operating systems / applications will be worth a lot as well. Yes, there may be virtualization as a option but I am not optimistic in the performance of such a feature.<p>Back to your question.

Even in 3-4 years, the amount of developers familiar with x86 and the sheer amount of software already available for it will trump the offerings of ARM.",1294635435

Back then Intel was pushing raw performance disregarding power consumption, then they hit the heat dissipation wall, AMD snuck in from behind and punished them in a major way with Athlon-64. Intel regrouped with Core* series, won back the market share, pushed AMD back into oblivion, and relaxed about the whole thing. Now they are doing the same thing - prioritizing performance at the cost of power drain, and this time it will be ARM who will punish them. It's not clear how long it will take Intel to change their ways this time. The last time they still had Pentium 3 / Pentium M group of engineers to lean on, and that they did rather well.

There is no traffic shaping, but there is one write at the beginning that fills the kernel buffer without blocking.  (Why does this get ""bigger and bigger every year""?  Because people are setting it bigger.  By default, the tcp write buffer is something like 4k.  I have mine set to ~512k.)<p>If you want to accurately measure your bandwidth, try iperf.

56471,comment,56331,56331,0,0,gduffy,,,"To shed some light on our strategy for Xobni Insight:<p>What we've really been working on is a general platform for aggregating communication data (and on your machine, not ours!). The current features you see in Xobni are just a few ideas implemented on top of our platform. We will do more.<p>We say it's beta for a reason (this is not going to be gmail-esque ""it's always beta""), because we plan to add many fixes/features/platforms as we learn more about the needs of our (hopefully) growing user base. We really appreciate feedback, whether it is a problem report (support@xobni.com) or a new feature idea (beta@xobni.com). <p>Thanks for sticking with us everyone!",1190145345

In fact, I love swearing so much I even swear at my own grandmother. But it was funny. <p>The tone and voice of the author doesn't carry well. It's not funny. It's not satirical. Just a guy swearing about doom and gloom. Uncov, Flocksucks, and even Valleywag, this is not. ",1190145329

However, everyone I've interacted with uses web Outlook, not the installed client, myself included. Am I right that Insight does not work on the web version?<p>If so I might actually consider installing Outlook on my laptop just to get it, which is saying something. I would much rather not have to guess which page Ivanov is in my entire past history of alphabetized-by-sender messages. ",1190145317

56467,comment,56336,56336,0,0,vegashacker,,,"Nice work!  Regarding your application to YC, I'd guess that if this were a past project, and now you were doing something that wasn't this, YC would accept you in a heartbeat.  You guys could even be one of the ""leave the 'what will you make?' field blank"" groups, and get accepted.<p>But, YC already funded a <i>very</i> similar company.  I wonder if they would have reservations about funding a competitor.  Perhaps not, given that Zenter has  been acquired, but I don't know.<p>I was going to say that another issue is going head-to-head against Google.  But I now  don't think that's so much of a problem.  Yahoo and Microsoft are going to need their own versions of Powerpoint, and I think they'd totally snap this up.",1190144934

56462,comment,56394,56440,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"You're sharing value in something that can't possibly be defined yet. There is no market rate for that, that's my point. Web Designers don't get ""x"" value, because some designers might be as valuable as the founders, might actually be the founders or might just be a contract job. You've got a scale from 0% to 100% right there. <p>The only thing you can really do is equate the risk/value proposition in a way that seems fair for the amount of risk they are putting in. Are they working without pay? Are they doing this part time? Are they making suggestions that are helping you to decide the direction of the company? All of these are variables that you need to weigh.<p>Offering a piece of your company is a not normally a form of primary employee compensation. If you are looking at the designer as simply an employee, you'd be better off paying them, otherwise, you should IMO, not consider your designer as simply an employee.<p>Does that make more sense?",1190143947

If this becomes popular, microsoft could conceivably buy it.<p>I've just been using it for a bit, and there's one thing I find disconcerting. Let's say I click on ""Joe Blow"", and then I see ""Conversations with Joe (150)"". Okay, so I look at these ""conversations""...now, maybe other companies are different, but as soon as you get more than a few people in an office, the bulk of the emails have 20 people in the To: [] section. Thus, if Jane Doe sends 20 people an email, among whom was me and Joe Blow, then all of a sudden there's a ""Conversation"" between me and Joe.<p>Not the case.<p>Because of that, the tool seems to add quite a bit of noise. Maybe make an option for ""Types of conversation"", ""From Joe to me"", and ""From Me to Joe"".",1190143755

56458,comment,55974,56325,0,0,Goladus,,,"That sounds pretty close to what I'm going for, actually.  The solution is, of course, to define a set of building blocks that is orthogonal but easy to use, so that clever artisans will be able to combine in many different ways.  (like the 25 different blades, with 25 different handles, etc from the article).  My ideas are a little different, but mostly in the details and what sort of controls I'm hoping to give the artisans.<p>",1190143563

56456,comment,56336,56414,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This one is missing quite a bit of the graphic stuff that Zenter had (but seems to have lost for Google Presentations).  Rotations of text and images and browsing of Flickr and Google Images for images with drag and drop.  Font handling in Zenter was also awesome to behold.  It tried to replicate some of the really hard stuff in PowerPoint, that this one doesn't (yet).<p>Looks very slick, though.  Definitely a contender, particularly if Google Presentations doesn't bring in all of that functionality that we were seeing in Zenter before it got sucked up by Google.  The design is nice and clean, too, which is a plus.",1190143523

Thanks to you I finally understand the reason a decent salt matters, and I'll be sure to ditch SHA1 for bcrypt when I get home. You can rest assured I'm not trying to design my own password system (for anything public)... I was just wondering, are there other systems that do authentication without actually sending the password over the wire besides the supposedly-hard-to-implement Stanford one that may or may not be patented?

56454,comment,56245,56281,0,0,kcl,,,"He is obviously lying. This is not even a debatable point.<p>It's called spin. A representative of the business is giving a half-credible excuse for reverting to a process that will be unpopular but that will also generate more revenue. Politicians don't change their stances on abortion because of changes of heart...they do it because it will net more votes<p>For whatever reason it's taboo for a press release to say ""we're taking this course of action because it's more profitable"", unless you're talking to stockholders and not users, because 1. all business actions are taken with profitability, short term or long, in mind, so it goes without saying 2. you would piss off your users who care only what you give to them and rarely at all whether you're making money or not",1190143480

56450,comment,56407,56407,0,0,Jd,,,"Speaking from someone who attended one, it is very easy to go to an Ivy League school and not excel simply because you (and everyone else there) are assumed to excel because you attend one.  <p>As a point of a comparison take China.   China's most acclaimed school Peking University is fiendishly difficult to get into but gives a ridiculously easy education once you are there.  Still, Peking U grads are able to go most places they want.  Schools with a science/math/engineering focus seem to do better at maintaining a higher standard, but their students frequently come out looking like they just popped out of a cookie-cutter - not even a hint of an independent idea. <p>A fuller exploration question is of course more complicated than this, and would have to address at least the following questions:  Why did the core curriculum of the West die?  Could it be replaced with a broad and rigorous humanities education or are broad and rigorous contradictory?  If not, how can they productively be combined?\n",1190143064
56449,comment,56331,56331,0,0,tdedecko,,,"Thanks Xobni. I always felt outlook was broken. I hated using it. The search is terrible and finding email address and phone numbers is a pain. Being that I am forced to use outlook at work, I was really excited to try out Xobni. I installed it as soon as I could download it.<p>I found the search amazing and email address information was very helpful. For example phone numbers are easier to find now.<p>Though, the social features seem elaborate, unnecessary and bulky. I am not interested in that right now. Maybe I'll find it useful later on.<p>Overall, great product. fast, effective, and useful. Keep up the good work!",1190142509

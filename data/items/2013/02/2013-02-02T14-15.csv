5156090,comment,5155908,5155908,22,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"Requiring absolute certainty as a subjective being yields an incomprehensible, absurd universe. The scientific method is based on testing models, i.e. systems of measures, against each other.<p>I volunteer at two institutions: (1) as a reading tutor at a Harlem charter school and (2) as a mathematics tutor for disadvantaged youth in Lower Manhattan. At 1 the administrators regularly assess students' reading levels. The process is highly subjective but allows for individuals' effectiveness to be tracked, as well as tutors' and methods'. At 2 the administration is more ad hoc, giving each tutor more freedom but having no system for measuring progress. 1 has a good idea about what works and a programme with demonstrable effectiveness. 2 is a more challenging environment as every problem calls for starting from square one. I set my own measurement criteria but due to a small, variable sample they have low statistical power.<p>In both cases the measurement is subjective. Strictly codifying the measure and then lording over it would be unproductive. But having a measure and optimising processes to the measure creates a feedback loop. Simultaneously remaining vigilant of exceptions, e.g. a child who could read complicated words so long as they don't contain 'q', creates a meta-loop that optimises the measure-process system. Together one has a system that evolves, that learns.<p>""<i>We see that cars are safer for men than women because the crash-test dummies are men.</i>""<p>Crash dummies have made cars safer for women.

5156087,comment,5152435,5155683,3,0,electronvolt,,,"//1. As you say, the introductory classes are enormous. For the math classes this means less feedback on your assignments. What this also means is that you have other undergrads grading your work. If that doesn't terrify you, then it should.//<p>As someone who is an undergraduate TA (for computer science), this doesn't terrify me any more than overworked and underpaid graduate students grading assignments, or overworked research faculty who don't have any incentive to grade well.  My anecdotal experience has been that it's generally the top 1-3% of undergrads who end up TAing or grading (in CS, at UVa; mileage elsewhere may vary), and those who do take it pretty seriously (here, at least, we're paid and it's a job).  Most of the people I've TA'd with (and myself) take at least one graduate course and actually know the material better than most graduate students (since we've taken the course and universally done very well in it).  UVa also rotates graduate TAs out after a year (to research or other things), whereas undergraduate TAs can stay on the same course for two or three years, which offers much more continuity for the professor and fewer TAs who are completely lost.  I might be biased (see also: I get paid to do exactly what terrifies you), but I think that if the undergraduates aren't just unpaid volunteers, you get better results than using graduate students for the same things.  Unpaid volunteers are much worse: you don't have to pay much, but paying someone for something makes it a job, which switches people's headspace from 'I can drop this' to 'This is my job, and I will do it well'.",1359816785

No explaining to employers why they suddenly decided to pack up and leave during a large cheating scandal. Just a forced vacation.<p>I'm also pretty appalled that students supplied the same answer down to typological errors. When the scandal first broke out, it sounded much more mundane - that there was little guidance, and that students asked their TAs for help. At least then, it's possible to rationalize the situation by saying that students genuinely did not believe they were doing something wrong.

A lot of the rules adults try to impose that are perfectly reasonable to anyone with enough empathy seem completely arbitrary to a 4 year old. So, ""don't yell because that distracts/bothers me"" is an ""arbitrary"" rule coming from a ""cranky"" dad. ""I put a script in the machine that will shut down the screen if you yell too loud"" gets translated into ""I don't want you to yell"", which is, again, an ""arbitrary"" rule kids don't care about.<p>On the other hand, ""computer doesn't like loud sounds"" is a perfectly ""reasonable"" rule, because the computer is ""in charge"" of letting you play the game. You disturb the computer, the computer reacts. And you can't argue with it or try to manipulate it. Crying at it or throwing a temper tantrum won't do any good. It has no mouth, so you can't have a conversation with it. In short, you have to follow its rules.<p>If you want to avoid having the kids jump to the ""logical"" conclusion that the machine is a person, you can formulate it differently: instead of saying ""the computer doesn't <i>like</i> loud sounds"", you can say ""the computer is a machine that doesn't work well when there's a lot of yelling"".<p>Then again, someone else already pointed out that kids believe that an old, fat man can come down their chimney and leave gifts in a matter of minutes -- and do so for every kid in the freaking world -- without suffering any psychological scars from an ""untruthful"" method of influencing their behavior (because Santa brings gifts only to kids who are ""good""), so I don't see what the big deal is with going through a short period of believing the machine is a person.",1359813925

You have a Function add object that has methods bindWith1(x) and bindWith2(y) both returning a function of one argument.<p>With add they do the same but with say divide they do different things (both useful).",1359813867

5155966,comment,5155820,5155887,4,0,rwmj,,,"In a traditionally compiled language, currying doesn't provide varargs: the compiler still has to know how many parameters a function takes before it can be called.  You cannot write `printf ""%d"" 1' expecting that at runtime printf is going to parse the string and read further arguments, because the compiler wouldn't know when printf can be called.<p>OCaml famously (or notoriously) hacks this knowledge into the compiler, so the compiler knows about format strings and parses them.  This is nicely typesafe, but means you cannot use varargs in your own functions, and there are odd restrictions on the format string.  (You can use the camlp4 preprocessor, or lists-as-parameters, to get around this).",1359813853

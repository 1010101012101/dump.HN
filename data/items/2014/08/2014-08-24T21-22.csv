For the first 24 hours after Hurricane Ivan it was completely focused on: Are our employees safe; do they have water/food; what medical aid is needed; how can we get blankets and cots into our office so our employees have a place to sleep tonight? All the roads are washed out, there was no real in/out of town for a week, no power to our main DC for 3.  Having redundancy in Chicago and Virginia didn&#x27;t really mean shit when we couldn&#x27;t get key people to those data centers to run them full steam.<p>The end result was a high reliance on contract employees at the fail-overs, and a real appreciation for the human element.",1408917491

Seen in that perspective, a sucky type system is good enough because it&#x27;s use isn&#x27;t to verify program correctness. Personally, I think a standardized format for describing types in docstrings would be 100x better but that&#x27;s not the way the Python core devs have choosen.<p>Another argument in favor of types is that it will enable Python to optimize code better. But since Python isn&#x27;t built for static typing, the CPython bytecode interpreter has no facilities for exploiting the extra information. And even if it had, the V8 Javascript VM proves that you dont need static types to generate optimized code.",1408917207

I&#x27;ve put a lot of time and effort into developing ECMAScript (JavaScript) 3 patterns that overcome various limitations, and have got accustomed to the idea of deploying ECMAScript 3. In terms of providing an API, getters and setters will be very useful. It will be good to have out-of-the-box JavaScript functionality that does not require extra code to use, like various methods I use to overcome the ECMAScript 3 limitations.<p>Does anyone have an estimate for when ECMAScript 6 will be widely deployed across browsers, almost ubiquitous? I would say now it&#x27;s safe to use SVG in many situations on the web that would not have been OK a few years ago, I&#x27;m curious about when the tipping point will be with ECMAScript 6.<p>Anecdotally, recently my customers have been a lot less interested in supporting older versions of IE, and I have used SVG in a couple of situations, and that would not have been OK a few years back. I have not been closely following the developments of ECMAScript 6, it has seemed like it will be a while until it&#x27;s widely deployed. The only things I have found practical use for are typed arrays, and I have been using them in node specific code rather than in code that I expect to run across browsers.<p>Though I am interested in the latest developments in JavaScript, my focus will still be on what can be done with the JavaScript available in almost every browser. I am also interested in making use of getters and setters in my code but being able to compile it to ECMAScript 3, I may be able to do some relatively simple text replacement rather than having to parse and compile an abstract syntax tree.",1408916938

So, yes, because they are imperfect and optional, you don&#x27;t catch every type error, and you need to add type hints / casts that in a perfect system wouldn&#x27;t be necessary.<p>Is this kind of flawed type system worth it? Hell yes.

And that&#x27;s just the programming stuff.  I had to create a very intelligent algorithm to handle the computer player AI.<p>Prior to taking on such a monumental project, I had over 20 years of experience with x86 assembly, C/C++/C#, desktop application development experience using MFC and .Net, firmware development for ARM processors, device driver development on windows, simulator development for an engineering shop, manufacturing operations and testing software with database backend, reverse engineering of cell phones for forensic analysis, software development management, and the director of software engineering for a medical device company.<p>What are you most intersted in?

But it looks like there&#x27;s a tension between individual satisfaction, and collective quality.  I&#x27;m not sure this tension has to be.<p>Reddit implements different solutions, and so far it frustrate that HN doesn&#x27;t try some of them:<p><i>Markdown support.</i>  HN only has star-based emphasis and naked links.  Many comments would look cleaner if they could take advantage of at least citations and lists.<p><i>Inbox.</i>  Presently, I have to scroll down my &quot;threads&quot; panel to see if anyone has replied to me.  New messages are not even highlighted, so it&#x27;s easy to miss them.  This, I think, is the biggest long-term conversation killer.<p><i>Inline replies.</i>  Presently, when you reply to an HN comment, you are kicked to a page where you only see the comment you&#x27;re replying to.  Leaving the current page is a hassle, and may discourage some type of comments —probably not the type you&#x27;d want to encourage here, though.<p><i>No damn &quot;unknown or expired link&quot;.</i>  It&#x27;s frustrating to have that one every time I type a long comment.  Instead, I&#x27;d rather have some ninja-edit detector.<p>---<p>Maybe you want to limit such back-and-forth threads, possibly because of their average low quality, but Reddit have mechanisms to deal with that:<p><i>Hidden stuff is collapsed.</i>  Here in HN, hidden stuff is written in very light grey.  Still, it takes up screen space…  In Reddit, hidden stuff is just reduced to a single line, on which you can click to expand the hidden stuff.<p><i>Hide entire threads.</i>  When a comment is downvoted below some threshold, <i>the whole thread</i> is hidden by default.  One has to click to recover it.<p><i>Charge Karma for replying in a junk thread.</i>  That&#x27;s a LessWrong exclusive:  when you reply in a thread that&#x27;s supposed to be hidden because of too much downvotes on a particular comment, your karma instantly goes down by 5 points.  Just so people <i>really</i> think before they reply to trolls.  (Those who replied before the downvotes occured are not affected.)<p><i>Hide long-winded threads.</i>  When a Reddit thread gets too long, the later replies get cut regardless of their quality.  One has to click to see the end, so they don&#x27;t get very public.  I like this feature: you can do back-and-forth, but the other users don&#x27;t have to suffer this little private flamewar.<p><i>Hide lesser-quality threads in stuffed comment pages.</i>  Sometimes, a real popular pages gets over 500 comments.  For those, Reddit hides even some comments and thread that didn&#x27;t get any downvote.  The idea is to highlight the higher-quality comments.<p>---<p>Now there are some features I like in HN that you probably want to keep:<p><i>Hiding Karma scores.</i>  I&#x27;m not sure why, but my average went up the very day this came up.  It&#x27;s probably not neutral.  But most importantly, it seems to be a deliberate and tested feature.  You probably know more than I do about that.<p><i>No downvoting thy replies.</i>  It&#x27;s frustrating in Reddit when your reply is downvoted by just one point: you never know if it&#x27;s the parent&#x27;s author being a jerk, or if it comes from someone else, who is presumably more impartial.  HN removes that doubt, so I find it easier to stay civilized.<p><i>Dead comments.</i>  The distinction between massive downvote and death seems to be working here.  Not being able to reply to dead comments <i>at all</i> is probably valuable.<p>---<p>That&#x27;s about it.  Now you have even more work to do. :-)  Now I don&#x27;t expect all the proposed changes would be a good thing.  But I think most of them are worth testing.",1409392652

8246026,comment,8245758,8245934,4,0,dalke,,,"That&#x27;s a post hoc justification. By that logic, Americans traveling overseas should pay extra taxes for that bit of &quot;insurance&quot; coverage. There are about 30 million overseas tourists per year (see <a href=""http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0778210.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0778210.html</a> ); according to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigration_from_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigration_from_the_United_Stat...</a> there are about 5 million US citizens living overseas. (I&#x27;ve excluded Canada and Mexico from both of those populations.)<p>Assuming overseas tourists travel for only a week, this suggests they should pay an extra 2% in taxes, because they are about 10% of the overall cost. (I suspect it&#x27;s higher, since tourists often need rush jobs, like an emergency passport replacement, or information about local hospitals, that residents don&#x27;t need.)<p>I notice, though, that this isn&#x27;t the case, which tells me that the underlying logic is at best incomplete.<p>In addition, taxation is a pure headache when combined with jus sanguinis. The Forbes article pointed out the backlog in Canada. This is because a lot of US citizens moved to Canada and had children there. By US law, these children are also US citizens, even if they&#x27;ve never entered the US nor consider themselves such; nor even ever plan to leave Canada.<p>They are still supposed to file taxes to the US, report information about their bank account holdings, etc. In addition, &#x27;foreign financial institutions banks, brokers, pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, mutual funds, trusts&#x27; etc. are required &#x27;to report to the IRS holdings of their clients who are U.S. persons.&#x27; These can be a large headache, and may even limit some financial options as certain foreign financial institutions now refuse to accept US citizens.<p>Hence, the US has put obligations and restrictions on them that they don&#x27;t want, and must pay money to actively remove.",1409391994

That means, unless you explicitly mark a section of code as &quot;unsafe&quot;, it isn&#x27;t possible to have segfaults, have buffer overflows, use memory after freeing it, etc. A very significant amount of software bugs - famously, Heartbleed, but also a <i>huge</i> proportion of other security bugs in everything from servers to web browsers - can&#x27;t happen under Rust code. The point is to have a much more <i>secure</i> programming language, as in resistant to attacks, while still being as fast and as usable as other C-style languages.<p>The reason Mozilla are developing this is for Servo, a new browser engine which should be far safer than existing ones - although it&#x27;s also useful for pretty much any other code, as it wipes out entire classes of bugs with not much effort. If you write in a C-like language today, you could pick up most of Rust (lifetimes included) in a couple of days of playing with it.",1409390605

There is nothing lightweight about it. (The technical reason is because they call into kernel functions to perform their magic.)<p>The actual logic of saving/restoring registers and the stack frame requires about 5-15 instructions per platform, and is very easy to write in assembly. And for the platforms you don&#x27;t do this for, there&#x27;s a non-standard trick to modifying jmpbuf which works on x86/amd64, ppc32/64, arm, mips, sparc, etc. These techniques are literally <i>hundreds</i> of times faster.<p>Try libco instead.

And if you benchmark libco against all of the other stack-backed coroutine libraries, I&#x27;m sure you will be stunned at just how bad ucontext really is.

Now, they have no real reason to go outside of the solar system any time soon, but self sufficiency is a hop skip and a jump to growth and there are plenty of useful materials in the Ort cloud if you can self sustain on say fusion instead of just solar energy.<p>And thus a long slow boat to the stars starts off as simple resource extraction.  Sure, long term we might only be looking for gas giants as a ready supply of fuel vs planets to live on but there are other paths to the stars than a one shot moon landing style.",1409389325

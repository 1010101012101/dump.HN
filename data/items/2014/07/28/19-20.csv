See the recent improvements in Eclipse for an example.<p>I also find the comparison with C++ pointless, boring and–to be honest–ridiculous, as well as the remark about &quot;less bad&quot; syntax.",1406577598

We gave grades for how safe things were, how good the schools were, multiple heatmaps, assessor data, census data, nearby amenities -- a buffet of data. And sure, people who also fit in the mold of trivia collectors thought this was amazing.<p>But the more we talked to people, the more we found out that they really didn&#x27;t use this data, even when they said they appreciated it. We had really overshot the market -- users almost never delved into the statistics, yet took our grades as absolute authority. What people wanted first of all was just insight about whether it was a &quot;nice place&quot; or not, a maddeningly vague concept.<p>Ultimately, we trashed countless tables and statistics and scaled it back to one number. Yes, one 0-99 number that shows you, well, how &quot;nice&quot; a place is to live. We were so afraid of generalizing things like this because everyone is different and has different priorities and so on. But trying to make things custom for everyone is a losing game, and it turned out &quot;is it nice?&quot; is something everyone already knew intuitively.<p>So insanely, we went from having 50 extra data points on a home for sale to having one &quot;superscore&quot;. But a funny thing happened, which is it became much more successful in the site&#x27;s actual mission, to help people understand a home&#x27;s neighborhood without having to visit in person. And now we&#x27;re providing an insight that is compact enough that we can put it everywhere and people can digest it instantly.<p>So although we would ultimately like to give people a more data-conscious mindset, the tool and the user need to agree on that commitment. So we&#x27;re accommodating the user&#x27;s actual mental model while we work towards expanding it.<p>PS: We have our scoring model working nationwide, but as you have seen from the Zillow thread, it&#x27;s hard to get nationwide home listings.

When your station WXYZ holds a fundraiser, you donate to them, not to NPR. WXYZ pays NPR on a sliding scale. A station with 1 million listeners pays roughly 10x what a station with 100k listeners pay. NPR is actually barred from accepting donations directly, again &quot;bypass&quot;. (NPR can take big one-time gifts, like the Joan Kroc $250M).<p>Stations pay the biggest dollars for the big &quot;tent pole&quot; shows (Morning Edition/All Things Considered) and this supports many other program and functions. In the FM world, stations have basically had exclusive distribution right. Digital changes that, of course, and creates the &quot;bypass&quot; I mentioned below.

That is the conclusion of numerous top security experts, not just some pundits with an agenda.<p>It&#x27;s entirely the notion that it <i>could only have been</i> state sponsored that I have trouble with. While there may be no organization with resources comparable to the US government to throw at cyber security in general, there are certainly organizations which can throw large resources at any given particular problem.<p>Of course, other organizations that might have had the resources to create Stuxnet wouldn&#x27;t have had the motive or the relevant context (knowledge of details of Iran&#x27;s nuclear enrichment program) to do so. In that regard I don&#x27;t doubt in the slightest that it <i>was</i> state sponsored malware, but I think it&#x27;s dangerous to claim that anything <i>could only have been</i> state sponsored, as it accords a level of resourcing to the state that likely also applies to, e.g., organized crime or exceptionally large corporations who might not have our best interests at heart (not that I think the state always does either, mind you).<p>That said, my original question was genuine. I didn&#x27;t follow Stuxnet after the initial speculation that it looked like a state sponsored project, and thus I didn&#x27;t know whether we&#x27;d been officially caught or whether it was still (extremely well founded) speculation.",1406576875
8098948,comment,8096483,8097225,1,0,lsc,,,"Huh.  I went from a bmw 3 series, to a motorcycle, to a nissan maxima with unrepaired body damage to a minivan, and just recently got a motorcycle again.<p>I haven&#x27;t gotten a ticket in anything but the 3 series... but I don&#x27;t think that is entirely perception.  I drove a lot faster in the 3 series than I did in any other vehicle;  The thing feels as stable at 90 as the maxima or the minivan feels at 70.    (Now, I don&#x27;t know how much &quot;feel&quot; has to do with safety, if anything.   But my gut was comfortable going a lot faster in the 3-series than in anything else.)<p>But... yeah, my experience was that people expected a lot more aggression out of me in the 3 series.   Wait a microsecond after the light turns green?  that&#x27;s a honk and the finger.  In the minivan, from what I&#x27;ve seen, the expectation is that you are a slow driver that is distracted by kids.  People go around, but they aren&#x27;t <i>angry</i> at you like they are when you are in a bmw.<p>Then I had a Suzuki SV650.   Now, sometimes people didn&#x27;t see me, and once someone practically ran it over when I parked too close to a car, but the overall experience was reasonable.  People were even mostly tolerant of, you know, going too slow in turns and stuff.<p>I probably got the widest berth in the maxima.    It was like that old Saturday night live commercial where they were selling a luxury car that looked like garbage on the outside so that it wouldn&#x27;t get stolen.   The inside was all leather and heated seats.   But on the outside, the paint was degraded, and the rear passenger door was caved in.   It also had a bunch of smaller scars from my brothers learning how to drive, and because I&#x27;m terrible at parking.   But yeah, the car was big and said &quot;watch out, I might not have very good insurance&quot;  so people kind of got out of my way.<p>Really, the most aggression I have ever experienced was on the motorcycle.    I recently got myself another motorcycle (after being minivan-only for several years.   This one is an older oilhead; a &#x27;96 R850R)  -  and the other day?  An old lady actually got out of her car and started yelling at me because she felt that I took a parking spot she was waiting for.   I was... speechless.

For example, some manufacturers of vacuum cleaners easily charge in upwards of $20 for a small plastic piece that you wouldn&#x27;t expect to pay more than $8 for. So, if on-demand 3D printing services could compete with that niche, it&#x27;s something I could see being of use for aftermarket repair or replacement. Poorly designed plastic switches no bigger than your thumb shouldn&#x27;t be more expensive than hose attachments.<p>The only thing to worry about is the manufacturers&#x27; response: I don&#x27;t know how much money they make from replacement parts, but if it&#x27;s anything other than a minor revenue stream, I&#x27;d imagine they might issue legal threats or takedown notices.

Especially from the mobile site, it&#x27;s very common that I see something in the moment between opening the app and my timeline updating, and never being able to see the update again.<p>Facebook is already making the decision as to whether to show you a post or not, and they make that decision based on what they think you will want to see and what you will engage with, all of which is fuzzy and subjective. They already manipulate things you see to encourage engagement; for example, if their algorithm shows that your engagement is dropping and you&#x27;re about to leave, they&#x27;ll show other people your profile and say &#x27;do you know this person?&#x27;, because someone adding you as a friend boosts your engagement.<p>So if you think that showing you posts which are happy or sad is manipulative, be aware that Facebook is already filtering your potential-friends list and showing you people solely to boost engagement (either yours or theirs). Looked at another way, this means that it&#x27;s possible their algorithm isn&#x27;t currently showing you people you might know because it&#x27;s not as beneficial for them to make that connection for you <i>yet</i>.<p>So the purpose of Facebook&#x27;s site is to get people to interact and generate behaviour, and now they&#x27;re experimenting with that; which posts do we show? which do we hide? They haven&#x27;t shown them all for ages, so this is just a tweak to their algorithm that they were testing.<p>What&#x27;s really interesting here is how this could actually be used for good.

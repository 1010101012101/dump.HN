4353467,comment,4353087,4353349,1,0,epistasis,,,"People did gawk at the amazing creation and throw money at Facebook needlessly, and that's the problem. In a way, Facebook has been able to do a bit of market segmentation, and take the initial money from those that thought that it had the most value, without having to listen to the dissenting voices that think it's worth less. Typically, markets prevent such a great information disparity.<p>Before IPO, nobody knows for sure what the real valuation of Facebook is. They have their own personal valuation, but the eventual price on the market is going to be a reflection of the combined valuations, it's an average of sorts of everbody's belief about Facebook's ability to make money over the time scale that each particular investor cares about. You can make a price-demand curve out of it; pre-IPO I wouldn't have bought Facebook at any price, some people thought $15 per share, some people $20, some people $38, and some would have bought no matter what.<p>Facebook was unique in being able to take advantage of this market uncertainty, namely each investor's uncertainty about what everybody else thinks. They shielded the overoptimistic from the pessimists' views, or the overoptimistic didn't bother to acknowledge that there would be pessimists, and Facebook took the optimists' money first. In doing so they got the most capital for giving away the least possible. (This shwredness probably bodes well for their ability to make money in the future.)<p>Usually tech stocks go the other way because the company doing the IPO has very little leverage to set their own price; investment banks are the gatekeepers and won't let anyone through unless their customers unless they and their most-favored-customers make a bundle on the initial sale. Facebook was able to flip that dynamic around and make sure that <i>they themselves</i> made a bundle while all the investment banks' customers lost out. It takes both leverage with the investment banks and knowledge of the demand curve in order to pull something like that off.<p>If the overoptimistic end up being right on the long enough timescale, they'll get their money back. But for the moment there are too many pessimists about the future potential of Facebook for a $38 buyer to be able to get what they deem a fair value.<p>Buy low, sell high, simply means being optimistic when others are overly pessimistic, and being pessimistic when others are overly optimistic. There's a bit of predicting what the objective financials of a company are, but it's far more about realizing the psychology of everybody else with money to trade. It's not just Silicon Valley engineers that are overoptimistic...",1344391119

Of course these were on paper instead of digitally, but I think some of the same perspectives apply.<p>Double entry accounting always balances because it takes the viewpoint of a business with no intrinsic value, where debt owed to business and assets owned by the business (debits, lit. ""thing owed"") equals debts owed by the business (credits, ""thing entrusted to someone else"", either to creditors or to stockholders).  Because everything is recorded from the counterparty's perspective and the business has no perspective, the system is robust.  I further wonder if this isn't a natural development from medieval tally sticks to track debt.<p>But one thing that occurred to me is that it is hard to engineer this sort of system.  Double entry accounting systems were probably an organic development based on the opening up of literacy outside the Church in the later Middle Ages. Pacioli only wrote about a system already in use.  He did not invent it.  It seems to me that over the next hundred years or so we can expect to see our approaches to computing evolve in a similar manner.  The big challenge is that unlike building on tally sticks, we don;t have clear examples of how to do this with the computing problems of today.",1344387789

And one of the fundamental purposes of the scene is to eliminate duplicates - one valid release per movie/TV show episode.<p>If you want to spend your time reading scene notices and follow along with the endless pissing contests between the different release groups, that's fine. But if you just want to consume the content, like I do, it's pretty hard to find a better all-encompassing, no-bullshit source than the scene.

I know I am missing out on a lot of great content and it pisses me off...until I get my bill, which is a fraction of what I was paying before. Also, the convenience of my current setup is unmatchable.<p>The thing is, like you said, the technology has changed. I want shows on my current setup. I am willing to pay more for more content. One thing I thought was very interesting is Apple removing TV show rentals. I never purchase movies or TV shows. I like to rent them, watch them once and I usually don't want to watch them again. If I do, I will rent it again.<p>Why can't content providers understand this? Netflix and Hulu need to start creating their own content, which I know they are both working towards.<p>One semi-related note: AMC is ending Breaking Bad next season because of Madmen sucking up the budget - Netflix and Hulu: go buy that show!

There are far fewer use cases for it. At the end fo the day you probably need to get data back out of it.<p>* The vast majority of cloud hosting and hosting providers in general's bandwidth is outbound. People download from the web. These hosting companies provide a lot of the web's main infrastructure. You're probably looking at a ratio of 20:1 or 30:1 here.<p>* Linode doesn't pay for uploads and downloads with it's carriers / ISPs. It pays for circuits capable of synchronous upload and download speeds. Using the ratios above, if they, for example, have 300Mbps of traffic outbound, then they have a lot of spare inbound capacity.<p>* Abuse here is difficult. Downloading movies, music etc. are consumed at home. It's difficult to imagine so many usage scenarios where huge data volumes would be consumed so easily on a linode server without having to be downloaded again. Maybe someone can come up with some creative suggestions here though? :)<p>* Bandwidth allocation and contention is very different within a hosting providers access network than an ISPs access network. ISP last miles, local DSLAMs, AP's etc. are huge points of contention. Inside the data center, I imagine most hosting providers ""last mile"" are 100Mb or Gig/E here straight to the servers with gig or 10gig/e uplinks from access switches.<p>The basic crux really is though, they have shedloads of free inbound bandwidth and why not give it away for another USP.",1314920331

2952233,story,,,1,2,__throwaway__,"Ask HN: Going Through a Crisis/Burnout - Advice",,"Hi all.<p>I am going through quite a tough time of it lately, and would really appreciate some help + advice from hn, if that doesn't sound ridiculously vain and entitled. I am posting via a throw-away here, but am a moderate, if low-key, contributor to hn.<p>Some disclaimers: Forgive the life story aspect of this post. Just need to get it all out. Also apologies for the unrelenting sense of entitlement throughout. I am expressing how I feel, really feel, and that inevitably makes it sound as if I am not grateful for my first-world privilege. I am.<p>Background - feel free to skip...<p>Firstly, some background. I grew up in a family pretty much totally committed to a bordering-on-cult, but not really (a milder form - perhaps you could call it a sect?), whose tenets included the idea that we each have a 'natural talent' ordained by God and to go against it meant never really being able to find happiness/success.<p>'Thankfully' there is a person in this organisation whose 'responsibility' it is to (conveniently based on a letter you send them outlining interests/areas of academic success) dictate what your talent actually is. I was told to pursue a particular discipline in engineering, one in which I had no interest whatsoever. Thus began a very unhappy 5 years in which not only was I really unable to motivate myself to pursue the degree, but my family also fell apart due to my brother's repeated attempts to kill himself (thankfully all unsuccessful). I even failed exams one year, and suffered a lot of humiliation (professors telling me what a terrible student I was, etc.) and a complete undermining of confidence in my own intellect. I still managed to get a 2:1 from a good uni, but the experience has had a very serious effect on my ability to study anything, or even to hold my concentration long enough to get to any depth of understanding of a given subject.<p>So to programming - I have loved + programmed computers since I was 9 years old. I even contributed code to a relative's software firm when I was 15, though I did really little overall as a teen, certainly compared to many hn-ers. After uni, I decided I wanted to follow what I wanted to do, and worked an internal line-of-business job at one firm as a one-man team, then moved to another (my current job) where I've been for 4 years.<p>/Background<p>The situation now is that I feel quite desperate and despairing - I began feeling so passionate about programming but that has slowly been replaced with feeling utterly worn out + frankly terribly bored by it. I have had several overly-ambitious non-starter side-projects which I've screwed up, and busted so many interviews in such terribly crap ways that I've kind of lost count there too. I've spent 4 years at a place I am terribly unhappy at, and yet I can't pass a goddamn interview. I can't stand LoB/internal software anymore, and wonder whether it gets better anywhere else.<p>A large part of my anxiety at the moment is that I feel as if software engineering is all so much cargo cult bullshit. After reading articles on readability and quality of empirical evidence for readability tips, and certainly after reading a number of people's perhaps more cynical views in the community I have come to feel as if I simply cannot judge what is good or bad code, or at least that what I feel is good/bad is just bias. It's freezing me up and I find it utterly impossible to deal with the uncertainty of it all, something which attracted me to programming in the first place.<p>Another issue is feeling that the work can only be boring - it is impossible to motivate to work hard in spare time when you feel like you can't be passionate about something, and the idea that the 'reality' is that the thing is definitely boring, no matter where you work, is a horrific thought.<p>Another concern is that it's 'too late', 'too much competition', etc. and goddamn that grates at age 30. I am even considering a career change.<p>I suffer from depression, clinically diagnosed, so it's hard to know where that ends and 'real' concerns begin, but all-in-all I feel really down at the moment, and would appreciate people's help and advice.",1314919590

But this article points out that it is not easy to get every one to write and maintain good Scala in a team for that same reason. If a team attempted Haskell they would have a true pass/fail test and be less likely to end up in limbo.<p>Maybe that is Haskell's best point: It is hard to write bad Haskell. I have seen it- code littered with IO, poorly named variables/functions, and passing large amounts of arguments and configuration state. But that is very rare and re-factoring even that is usually at least very safe and sometimes straightforward. So it is difficult for a novice to do a lot of damage.

My first account was with HSBC, I waltzed in filled the forms out. Walked out. My friend I travelled with came with me, got a different case manager ... took over 4 weeks and eventually moved to Ireland before his account was even opened.<p>The differing service you can get from one bank is amazing. Just take this example from a trip I took a few months ago.<p>I went to Thailand with 3 mates from the UK, all Llyods customers. One had a friend as his bank manager who OK'ed his for use in Thailand. He had no trouble at all.<p>Second guy OK'd his but he withdrew 20,000 baht in one transaction and his account was locked as he wasn't told there was a threshold. He had to ring help desk to unlock his account, it was fine after that.<p>Third guy didn't realise he had to OK the account, every time he used an ATM his account was locked. He would ring help desk every few days to unlock his account. It seemed he could only draw down 10,000 baht a week, if he tried a second transaction a few days later it would lock again.<p>No matter what he asked for they just unlocked his account and promised it would lock again. But we where there for a month, and he was always on the phone to the bank.",1314918680

It's just a sequence from a simple perspective to a more complex perspective, and actually ends saying that it's better if you are willing to expand your view, exactly like you are saying. :)<p>~<p>On the second part of your comment, well, you are talking about ""web designer"" specifically, and with a very specific definition of it as well. If that's your definition, then yes, he <i>have</i> to do that.

For us, there's the problem that many of our customers have no idea whether ""5GB"" or ""10GB"" or what-have-you is enough for them. We're willing to offer enough capacity that we're betting that they won't ever have a problem with it, and the shorthand for that is ""unlimited"". We're also gambling that if we do have one or a few customers that abuse the unlimitedness to such an extent that we have to talk to them about it, that we can have a reasonable conversation with them.<p>I think reasonableness is a big part of claims like this. Would a reasonable person expect to be able to download the internet into Linode? I don't think so, even though they're saying that it's unlimited.<p>If someone can think of a better way to tell most customers ""don't worry about resources"" without annoying a select few, I'm all ears.",1314918446

As long as Linode's total inbound is less than total outbound (which is very likely due to their focus on hosting rather than backup), it is free to them and thus they can make it free to their customers.

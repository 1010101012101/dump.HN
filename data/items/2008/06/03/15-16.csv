208012,comment,207247,207982,0,0,Tichy,,,"I can't really defend Twitter's architecture, I am simply interested in the best way to implement something like that as well - but not as a centralized service.<p>Just a note: email does polling, too. Most email clients poll the server on a regular basis. But that is usually every 5 minutes or less? Twitter has just limited polling to 30 times per minute for external clients, if I remember correctly.<p>I haven't thought too deeply about it, but I wonder if a mixture between polling and pushing could work. Either it could be decided on the nature of the client if it should push or poll (ie how many subscribers does it have, how active is it), or clients could connect and say ""please push for the next 20 minutes"" or just send keep-alives. If client alive, push, otherwise let him poll? I doubt that polling could be eliminated completely. If an email server is offline for an extended period of time, the message never arrives. Mabye that is acceptable, though.",1212508697
208011,comment,207857,207953,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Yep, assuming the byte sequence is guaranteed to be valid UTF-8 in any case. But if there's a chance that it isn't, then it's probably coming from disk, network, etc., so the IO will outweigh the extra validation anyway.<p>Back-iterating works pretty well, too.<p>Indexed code point access is the only thing that has a real penalty, as it is always O(n) in time unless you add an O(n) memory position table with O(n) preprocessing time and O(1) runtime lookup. However, code point access only gives you so much anyway, as combining code points mean you can have more than one code point per character. You have that same problem with UTF-32.",1212508655

I would add two more to the list that I wish I knew at 22...\n1)  Don't buy a house.  Yes it may be a good investment.  Yes owning/living in your own house does provide a lot of personal satisfaction.  But it can really tie you down.  Aside from housing market woes, you become invested in a house and can become incredibly attached to it.  It makes it difficult to just up and sell it in order to travel.  Even if you can travel for $1000 a month, that doesn't work if you have mortgage/bills/upkeep on a house back home.\n2) Don't get pets unless you are willing to be tied down or have a built in plan for having the animal taken care of while you are gone.

There are a lot of complications (in the UK at least) for share holders and their tax liabilities. A good lawyer needs to structure the company in such a way as to make it as simple as possible.<p>There are overheads. Host territories require 1 or more people to be employed within the host state for full incorporation. The more dodgy the place, the more reliable people cost. If you get it wrong they walk away with all your money and the host country doesn't really care.<p>To be fair the the poker company PKR.com incorporated in Guernsey (small island of the cost of france) and AFAIK it's all gone well for them so it can work. The thing is they see millions of dollars a day going through their account so it's worth it. They are a very legit Poker company and DO pay taxes in Guernsey but none to the UK government which are at a higher rate.<p>You definitely need a specialist lawyer. It's a moving goal post as countries change laws to try to stop this sort of thing. As goal posts move lawyers costs add up.

207982,comment,207247,207917,0,0,smanek,,,"For starters, I don't buy your premise that most mail doesn't go to dozens of recipients - I don't have data to back this up but I'd bet that between mailing lists, spam, etc., the vast majority of email (by volume) is sent to multiple recipient.<p>And yes, it is true that SMTP doesn't use polling. But that is <i>because</i> polling for messages doesn't scale very well - a smart 15 year old could tell you that. I don't how twitter's architecture works, but if it polls all a user's subscriptions each time that user logs in then I say that was a bad architecture decision.<p>It would be pretty straightforward to emulate subscriptions with a 'mailing list' type solution. The simple fact of the matter is that Twitter chose a poor architecture. If they simply used an inbox/mailing list type solution all their problems would be non-existent and twitter would scale, near linearly, as you increased the number of servers.<p>Yes, it would be grossly inefficient HD space wise - but who cares? Normalization (seems to be) what got them in this mess. And disk space is cheap enough that it doesn't really matter.<p>Assume Twitter had a million active users (they don't), and that they each sent 5 Tweets/day on average (users don't), and that each user was subscribed by 5 Users on average (they aren't). That means about 5GB of Tweets are made a day. Using an inbox type scheme (with absolutely no normalization - which is unlikely) that would only require about 25GB of storage a day. Given reasonable cluster costs (and assuming data is 4x redundantly stored on the cluster), that would require well under a $100K/year in storage expansion (to store all tweets forever). Using semi-intelligent caching and partial normalization I think it would be pretty easy to cut those storage requirements in half w/o breaking a sweat.<p>I say again Twitter's problems are trivial - they just seem to have (initially) made a lot of poor design choices, and are now living with the consequences.",1212507269

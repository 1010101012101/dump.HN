For some positions this is a good thing when you have control over the outcome and you're confident you're upto par.

If someone is hiring you to do something, they're taking the risk of you not delivering enough value, but they're also entitled to whatever rewards they can get from your work, which can be several times what they're paying you. Basically the author wants to take all the risk, and if he doesn't have a substantial bonus, very little of the rewards.<p>Well, of course anyone can live to make other people profit more, but it's a bit strange to tell everyone to live like that.",1366804775

When you exercise the option, buy stock at $0.01, and sell it at $10 milliseconds later, that is a short term capital gain.  If you exercise them years before selling them, you have long term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.  You increase your after-tax payout by (say) 10%, with the risk that your payout will be $0.  Or less than the cost to exercise your shares.

Basically there was this porn trolling outfit who would buy low budget porno and go hunting for infringers.  Mostly, they would get people to settle for $X,000, but when people fought back, things got weird.<p>When defense lawyers investigated the people behind this, we started seeing crazy allegations about how the forensic evidence was handled by one of the guy's brothers.

And headquartered, for the most part, in a tax haven with weird laws relating to trusts.  I'm not sure how many places allow trusts for the benefit of the children of a man who has no children, for example.  There were also allegations that certain defendants settled by agreeing to have a lawyer chosen by the plaintiff lose their case for them.  And there were serious questions about the copyright transfers, not to mention a man who claims to have had his identity stolen so that he could be listed as the owner of one of the shell companies.<p>All this crazy has prompted several judges to look into it.  It has also prompted the porn trolls to start pleading the 5th.  And dismissing cases, including one where they had already won a default judgment.

Then again, that may have to do with extreme costs of living and mediocre quality of life pushing a lot of people out as they get into their family-building years. But my observation has been that age discrimination <i>starts</i> in the late 20s, although it doesn't become a show-stopper (only an annoyance) till much later.<p>It's not about absolute age. It's about harsh age grading. If you're 37 and VP/Eng, you're fine. If you haven't held a management position by that age, it starts to raise questions (even if you have no desire to manage). Hell, even at 26 you're out of the running for analyst-level positions in banking; you better have something that shows you're associate-level (a graduate degree or strong technical accomplishments).<p>I'm 29 and already experiencing age discrimination. I'm losing callbacks because I have ""too many jobs"" (which is basically a legal, back-door age discrimination although it's about the cynicism and ""disruptive"" expertise that come with ""job hopping"", not chronological years). Now, any place that has that attitude is a shitty place to work, but sometimes shitty jobs are useful and it's a loss (not a major one, but it affects leverage and financial planning) not to have them as options.",1366803456

This land was created in order to increase the amount of farm land available, so that the country could increase its food production and better sustain itself.<p>All towns in this area are 'planned cities'. 1 larger one (Emmeloord) in the middle, and a bunch of smaller towns at equal distances around it. The goal for these towns was never prestige or some 'national symbol'; the goal was food, for which you need farmers. Farmers need towns for groceries, schools, and so on, so towns would come.<p>Emmeloord itself was designed as a 'modern town' with straight roads and whatnot. The other towns were designed as if they had organically grown (church in the middle, expand from there). The town names were made up by linguists to sound like they could've been 'real' historically-evolved place names. All of it was intended to be practical and feel familiar.<p>In my personal opinion, much of it turned out quite well. Emmeloord itself would've been better of without the 'modern' city plan IMO, but there's many other cities (or large suburbs) much like it because of the urbanization wave in the 60s.<p>The area is not especiallly known or celebrated by the Dutch. It is what it is: a dull rural area with a dull central town. Which was exactly the idea.",1366803444

Dirty secret about coding. You're typically at your best doing 3-5 hours per day of actual programming. If you're doing 6-8 hours, split that with a workout. The other working time should be spent on design, exchange of ideas, and learning new stuff.<p>If you use a high-productivity language like Clojure or Haskell and work on a green field, you'll find that you <i>can't</i> program for 12 hours straight, because there's no fat in the development process. Your brain starts to hurt after 8-9 hours. Personally, I can get useful work done for about 11 hours per day (I seem to average 65-70 hours per week, including writing which has taken a lot of my time recently, no matter what my mode of employment) but there is no way I'd be able to write code for 77 hours per week. Maybe 55 if I really had to push.<p><i>If you're not willing to pay $150k for a great developer that's going to get shit done, you're fucked already.</i><p>My first programming job paid just over half of that (well, with a sizeable bonus, but 3x higher than the ""top of range"")  and I got shit done. Cost-of-living is also a factor. I would probably build in Austin or Boston (it annoys me that those cities' names rhyme because they happen to be the top 2 candidates for the 2018 tech hub, as I see it) where the brains-to-dollars ratio is more favorable than New York's.

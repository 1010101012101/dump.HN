Believe me, I tried looking elsewhere. It wasn't much cheaper. The solution I ended up with was moving into a tenement in LES with the girlfriend, who had a lease dating back five years. That was the 'cheap' way to go.<p>2) I'll quote the managing director on my desk: you need about 500K a year to live normally in Manhattan with a family. That's like 10 families in the flyover states.<p>4) At least in 2005, if you tried using CL to find an apartment in NY, you'd find it completely taken over by broker spam. As Craig Newmark himself mentioned in a recent interview, de-spamifying the New York CL rentals listings was one of his biggest challenges. I can't imagine it's much different now, although I'd love to see otherwise.<p>6) Dude, Starbucks isn't a cafe'. The fact you're even counting them proves my point about New Yorkers.<p>7c) Actually, New York delis can't sell wine by law, probably as a kickback to the liquor store owners. So good luck finding that bottle of Sonoma at 2am on Friday. I never did.<p>8) Yeah, and try getting to those big box stores from Manhattan. It starts with a subway ride to midtown to rent a car from one of the agencies next to the Queen's Midtown tunnel....<p>9) Eh, actually they did talk to me, once I dropped the G-bomb, which is kind of the point of the post. I wasn't a startup geek when I was in NYC.<p>That might be enough for one reply....",1280872781

But those things are an intrinsic part of having a fully centralized system. Somebody not in the favored central government is going to want to be in the favored central government clique, and in the absence of other mechanisms to keep them in check (like letting the market decide who wins or even having both win), it's going to turn to violence.

I don't have an issue with the coach of a team that in fact does generate millions getting a high salary.  Arguably the US should have a club system similar to Euro soccer for football and basketball, or the  NBA should start to pay higher than pennies for its minor league and the NFL should start a minor league limited to 18-22 year olds to groom players (NFL football is too rough for 18 year olds' bodies).<p>I think the coach of a football program making a huge sum is different from the administrator of a college - for one thing, elite football coaching talent is in short supply.  The supply of executives who can lead a university is not.  Last I checked there are plenty of executives cooling their heels golfing etc.<p>However I could be convinced to hold football/basketball coaching salaries way down as part of a movement to de-professionalize college athletics by sending the coaches who are really using college athletics as a way to huge salaries to the pros.  The way it operates now is simply absurd, especially given that elite level players receive none of the spoils of filling stadiums during the prime athletic years of their lives.<p>Back directly on topic, the problem with administrators making huge multiples of professors is it is attracting the wrong kind of people, i.e. profit maximizers who figure out how to funnel increasingly large sums of money into their own pockets.

You have intelligent people that have learned how to ""excel"" well, who fit the bill of the subject of the NY Times article.  They get through with a decent GPA, party hard, and get a corporate job.  You have intelligent people that thrive in the learning environment that college affords, and they gain a lot out of it.  Their work ethic takes them places, and some develop that work ethic in college. I'm one of the latter, so call me biased towards it.  Then there are the hard working, intelligent people who feel caged from the curriculum.  These are the people who question the value.<p>The problem with the people that already have the strong work ethic and intelligence is that they assume that everyone is like those peers in the first group that simply go through the motions, and its not a question of whether they should have went to school but how they approached it.  These are the loudest voices against the higher ed system.<p>It's undoubtedly a broken system, but inherent value exists for some.

I was really surprised with how odd vim-latex felt.  \nIn my experience, most of these language-specific vim plugins stay pretty light, enhancing built-in vim behavior to perform in the expected way given a particular language's peculiarities.  Instead, it tries to build up this complex system of macros and shortcuts that added a really thick layer on top of actually writing LaTeX (a process that I actually quite enjoy).

That means the chief has more wives because he has more status and resources.  Half the men die because they are feeble or in adventures.  Men select for fertility, hence beauty and youth.  I suppose all this worked pretty well in a tribal society, but we now have a serious imbalance as a civilization.  As I said above, men in jails and unchecked aggression and greed in our leaders.<p>It is now up to the women to do a little directed social evolution to get us a more equitable civilization.

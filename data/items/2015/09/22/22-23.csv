You&#x27;re already sitting on the receiving end of bullying with an existential threat, so there&#x27;s a strategic choice (talk/don&#x27;t talk) with risk on either side.<p>As a founder who has taken on a legal threat from a big-corp before, know that bigger companies are in the habit of being bullies like this, because they get away with it far more than they should, and they might not even realize how stupid it is.  Big-corp&#x27;s lawyers are simply incentivized to rack up billable hours, legit or not.<p>But when you can make it clear to big-corp&#x27;s strategic decision makers that there&#x27;s far less upside than they expect (including that they have practically zero chance of winning anything), and far more downside (including that they will really look like idiots in front of their customers, their employees, future strategic partners, etc), big-corp usually calls off its lawyers and moves on to the next person on their hit-list.  They&#x27;re usually rational enough not to pursue negative-ROI activities for very long simply for vengeance.  If the threat of going public isn&#x27;t enough to make them back down, it&#x27;s ugly, but you&#x27;ve got to follow through.",1442962714

It&#x27;s something I also have never heard of until reading this post.<p>I&#x27;m personally bothered by the entire tipping culture in the US.  Once used to acknowledge that someone has gone above and beyond, now it is just used by businesses as a means to pay below minimum wage (which is too low already).  The fact that it is also percentage based this means a person working at a restaurant with higher prices likely makes more money just because I&#x27;m charged more for the food.  This doesn&#x27;t seem fair to those workers who are wait staffing at a more affordable restaurant.  I can tip above standard percentages at those restaurants, but this isn&#x27;t going to translate to the whole.<p>It is also well known that other discriminatory issues factor in to tips (age, gender, race, attractiveness, etc...)<p>Bottom line, tipping should be thrown out as an expectation and should have zero impact on wait staff wages.  Restaurants should be forced to pay at or above minimum wage and menu prices can be adjusted accordingly.  As dependent as today&#x27;s society is on the food service industry, maybe it is about time they unionize and start striking at the local and/or national levels until some laws are changed to treat them fairly.",1442962683

10262264,comment,10258475,10259356,0,0,hunter2_,,,"There&#x27;s quite an easy solution to using a Groupon without compromising your experience: don&#x27;t disclose that you&#x27;re using it until you&#x27;re completely served. I strive to hand it to the server during the final bus, so that they don&#x27;t have to print the bill twice. If I&#x27;m slipped the bill unexpectedly early, I put down the Groupon with my payment to similarly avoid an extra round trip (and I mention that it&#x27;s there, not let the server discover it at the POS station).<p>Most, but not all, Groupon deals have fine print prohibiting this by stipulating that the Groupon be disclosed on arrival or while making a reservation. I disregard this because I would much rather give the restaurant the opportunity to not honor the discount (I will pay in full including tip, and use the Groupon properly on a return visit) in exchange for uncompromised service.<p>I have never had restaurant staff so much as hint any sort of disapproval when I slip them the Groupon late, let alone reject it. Not even close. I think it&#x27;s because they <i>get it</i> - it makes sense to do this.<p>(The above applies only to full-menu fixed-discount deals such as &quot;$50 to spend on food and drinks&quot;. Obviously I cannot and do not use this method when the deal involves anything along the lines of a prix fixe menu, because in those cases one must be treated differently upon arrival.)<p>I tip based on the pre-discounted bill and generally the service is great enough (thanks to this technique) to hit the 18-20% mark. If I disclosed the Groupon earlier and received subpar service as a result, I&#x27;d give an appropriately low tip.",1442962660

Even a different NoSQL db would probably have been a more popular/respected choice, at this point.<p>And, though I know this has been said before, it bears repeating: most developers who deal with data on a regular basis are best advised to go ahead and get comfortable with SQL. So far, it is BY FAR the best solution to the great majority of data-storage-and-retrieval use cases.

Screen is amazing (although dim in bright sunlight), and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with memory (right now, with 3 web browsers and a text editor open, I am using 5gb out of the 8gb total). The processor is very fast, although the integrated graphics card is slow (whether this matters or not depends on what you are doing...

10262220,comment,10261792,10261792,0,0,geofft,,,"This is confounding two separate issues: using the system call interface instead of the platform C library, and static vs. dynamic linking. It&#x27;s an easy thing to confound, because (as the author states) on many platforms, including not only Solaris but also OS X, the only interface to the libc <i>is</i> dynamic linking. But you can certainly dynamically link to libc.so without dynamically linking to anything else, and without using dynamic linking within your own language community. (Rust takes roughly this approach.)<p>There&#x27;s one more subtler problem with the &quot;defined to exist on POSIX&quot; thing: strictly speaking, what&#x27;s defined to exist is a C-language interface. Some interfaces may be defined to use macros, and some platforms may make things work when compiled through the C compiler but not through the dynamic-linker interface. One example that I&#x27;ve run into recently, when binding things in Rust, is the cmsg API, which is primarily defined in terms of macros to walk a heterogeneous array, and has to be reimplemented in Rust (with platform-specific code): <a href=""https://github.com/carllerche/nix-rust/pull/179"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/carllerche/nix-rust/pull/179</a>. Another example is Android, which before 5.0 (Lollipop) exposed a handful of signal-handling functions as inline functions in a C-language header file, so they were not actually dynamically linkable: <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/a8dbb92b"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/a8dbb92b</a>. In both of these cases I would have loved to just #include the C header, but cross-language, that wasn&#x27;t an option.<p>It does seem that cgo has some ability to just #include the C header, as demonstrated here. I&#x27;d be curious to know if it&#x27;s powerful enough to handle these two cases.<p>(Also, the author is totally right in saying that this doesn&#x27;t belong inline in random application code. If you find yourself writing code like this, it <i>should</i> end up in an abstraction library so that porters have a single place to look, and any application calling `tcsetattr` gains the portability benefits.)",1442961853

It was wishful thinking. On desktop things worked wonderfully, but unfortunately there is no getting around what was also true 8-years ago - browsers are just not able to support the fine tune detail required to stuff UI (animation, interactions and all)into an app on your device. Something that reacts well to a no-keyboard, thumb-based UI. Something as simple as focusing in and out of an input box still makes the keyboard and your UI go nuts.<p>After all this time I get the sense that the level of detail required to create a beautifully functioning app, and a browser&#x27;s ability to render a wide range of HTML, will never find a balance.<p>I think things haven&#x27;t improved as much as I&#x27;d would have hoped because of the security measures a browser must enforce in order to restrict a developer from hacking a user&#x27;s experience negatively.

And because you are not in her field and not her audience, you don&#x27;t realize what she actually means by the all-caps &quot;THIS&quot;. She&#x27;s not talking about design in principle.<p><i>&quot;Are we having a debate or a therapy session?&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;Designers will do anything to convince themselves we are not in a service industry.

Most designers in today&#x27;s consumerist culture work on things that are morally empty, have little to do with making the world a better place. So they make themselves feel better by convincing themselves that they are in fact saving the world through design. I have a college friend who studies art and is very counter culture. But because of the limited job market, she works in the marketing department at Avon. I know that inside she hates it.<p>The internet technology analogy would be how most people who work on ad supported websites, especially those who work on the ad tech itself, in their gut feel wrong about pushing ads on people, but then put a positive spin on it by telling themselves, their coworkers and friends that it enables people who can&#x27;t afford their content or service to use it for free. Cognitive dissonance. I know this personally as long ago I led teams that worked on the systems that inserted ads in the Disney, ESPN and ABC websites and into their internet and iPad video streams. Not a single person was proud of their job, though it was plain as day everyone tried their best to pretend to be. &quot;daily affirmations&quot;<p>She calls out the dishonesty of taking advantage of privilege while critiquing the injustice and unfairness of the world:<p><i>&quot;…on our way to yoga…&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;We drink fancy coffee and eat free gummy bears and free catered dinners meanwhile the median cost of rent in SF is $4,300 dollars.

Design can’t even change the design industry. Let’s talk about something meaningful and actionable like why we have six dudes and one lady on stage.

Keep in mind that he runs Whole Foods as a company, not as a series of co-ops (as such stores are usually operated). Wouldn't it stand to reason that he's in favor of doing as much good as is financially sustainable? His main criticism is that the public option <i>isn't</i> financially sustainable. ""We can't afford this, it will do more harm than good, and the individual consumer can be empowered to make a difference themselves""? That seems quite compatible with what Whole Foods is.<p>I get how it's bad PR on Mackey's part. But it's an unfair expectation on the part of the boycotters.",1251266061

786645,comment,785477,786353,0,0,philwelch,,,"The difference is that these companies <i>actually contribute money</i> towards something. I don't buy Rockstar either. I don't buy Sony because they put rootkits on CD's. Writing a well-reasoned editorial that I disagree with doesn't rise to that level.<p>If Whole Foods contributed their profits to fund anti-health-reform PACs I guess that would be comparable, <i>but they don't</i>. They pay $1 in salary to a CEO who wrote one editorial in one newspaper expressing his personal opinions and experiences. That's akin to getting ticked off at something Paul Graham wrote and refusing to do business with any YCombinator-funded startups.<p>Actually it's even worse, since I'm pretty sure Paul Graham makes more money from YCombinator's investments than Mackey makes from Whole Foods at this point. And, unlike Mackey, Paul Graham's made some recent political contributions, so the money he makes from YCombinator actually goes to ""the bad guys"" (depending on your perspective) while Mackey's money either stays with him or goes to charity.<p>(OpenSecrets.org lets you search for political contributions. John Mackey's made some political contributions, but not since 2000 and even then, only to fringe nutjobs, which is the most harmless type of political contribution possible.)<p>The problem with politics is that people feel too strongly without thinking strongly enough.  It should not be blood-boilingly offensive for someone to express the contrary viewpoint about most political issues.",1251265475

Why?  In my experience, I have learned how to think and design my ideas to the point where others can best understand their positive potentcy.  I have applied what Ive learned in various aspects of business, into a functioning web startup as well.  The most negativity that I have ever seen from my having an MBA, is being told by a potential employer, that I am overqualified for a position.  And I honestly cannot complain about that.  Would much rather be overqualified than underqualified.  And thats just what my MBA has done for me.  Made me qualified.  Qualified to work in the position that I want, qualified to run my own startup, and qualified to write this post.  And its not just the piece of paper I received that qualifies me.  Its what I learned and experienced during my education.",1251265107

Software development is not a field comprised of well-defined problems and stable environments.  You simply can not bring scientific or mathematical rigor to a field where A) software can encompass any conceivable idea or concept that exists in the entirety of human knowledge, and B) specifications for every single project are different, and can almost never be firmly agreed upon before work begins even with the foremost world experts involved.<p>Imagine trying to develop engineering practices if there were infinite different realities each with their own bizarrely unique laws of physics.  What about building a medical knowledge database if every generation of humans was built from a completely new DNA sequence.<p>Without some groundbreaking advancements like true AI there is not much hope of the situation for huge projects improving across the board.

786629,comment,785477,786247,0,0,philwelch,,,"Do you think it would be okay for an employer to fire his employees for engaging in political activism for causes the employer does not support? For instance, if one of my employees holds a position of authority in a labor union, and in that position, publicly endorses a congressional candidate whom I oppose, should I be able to fire that employee?<p>Your analogy actually exposes the major problem here: rather than being a fellow member of society acting in good faith who simply endorses a different solution than you do, you cast Mr. Mackey as a ""soldier"" for an ""agenda"" who deserves ""retribution"" because he (implication: intentionally) is trying to ""negatively affect"" people. You allow absolutely no room for someone to disagree in good faith: the minute someone expresses a criticism of a political position you believe in, that person is ""the enemy"" and deserves ""retribution"". I adopt what I consider a more enlightened view: that people who disagree with me may just be right, that they are acting in good faith, that their criticisms deserve an answer, and that they are fellow members of the community.<p>Your mindset is that of a civil war between pigheaded zealots, mine is that of a peaceful and free society of civil, fair-minded people. You try to destroy people you disagree with without listening to them. I listen to them and carefully consider their views. Most of all, you presume that all of your opinions are right <i>above all criticism, question, or suggestion of alternatives</i>. I carefully consider every criticism of, and alternative to, my views because I have changed my mind in the past and anticipate having cause to change my mind in the future.<p>People who are incapable of considering the possibility they might be wrong aren't suited for a democracy. They're suited for a religious war. That's what this ""boycott"" against Mackey is, that's what the ""boycott"" against the Dixie Chicks was, and that's what politics in this country has degraded to.

I would feel irresponsible not doing some basic filtering and maybe some targeted filtering depending based on real world usage. I don't buy the morale argument at all because I always hear a lot of resentment along the lines of ""oh he's on facebook all day"" as a common put down of unproductive employees.

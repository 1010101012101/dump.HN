959112,comment,957615,959089,0,0,sheena,,,"True.  I didn't mean that some markets don't support price discrimination, just that customers' perception of it -- if they know it's going on -- is terrible.  With airline tickets, people see prices fluctuating over time: lots of bumps but also some apparent connection between the time/effort involved with buying early and a generally better price.  Customers seem to be more infuriated if they can easily tell that someone else is getting a better price on the same exact seat at the same exact time.  Given the fluctuations and the <i>expectation</i> of fluctuations in airline pricing, there's not much direct comparison going on among airline ticket consumers.",1259067082

The article is about an allegedly easily configurable conference call product, but the title imples some sort of cool, smart code that programmers would be interested in. Surely, the code backing the application is not three lines long but more like measured in tens of thousands.<p>This is not very different from posting an article with the title ""How to solve the halting problem in one line of code"" and then have<p><pre><code>  SuperLibrary.SolveHaltingProblem()
</code></pre>
as the code. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure Twilio is a great product and that it is very easily configurable or usable, but I think the title is simply misleading. Sorry for the rant but this is getting more and more epidemic on HN.",1259066927

I'm still wet behind the ears as an ""entrepreneur"" and thought there might be someone here who knew of this and/or had some personal experience with them.<p>One thing that confuses me: when does multilevel marketing become something to avoid? For instance, we recently had contact with whitedotbox.com who have partnered with Yahoo! to offer a pay-per-click search box that can drive revenue for charity and third-sector organisations. This seems all well and good, but it's highly tiered and has affiliate/referal incentives built in. What is the line between a ""pyramid scheme"" (so to speak) to be avoided, and a method to build in growth?<p>Might just be being very naive so feel free to kick me into gear ;)",1259065549

Not having to learn a new syntax and api for iPhone might have been handy... and then I would have avoided having to jump through the code-signing hoops that tend to break when you upgrade software versions.<p>So.. that's quite a bit of overhead for an app which only uses the geo-location feature of the hardware.<p>I do enjoy the Mac platform, XCode etc.  I'm not apple bashing here, but making a comparison.",1259065057

959092,comment,958613,958683,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"Yes.<p>There's a few metrics the airlines care about, the most important is leaving the gate on time. But once you're on the plane they can make you sit there for however long it is to sit on the tarmac.<p>When I was flying constantly for a month, almost all my flights were on time. FlightCaster did predict 2 flights that were to be delayed despite the planes pushing off on time. We just sat on the tarmac, upwards of an hour, before finally taking off.<p>By the same token, FlightCaster didn't predict the three other flights I was on that was delayed.<p>Either way, the use case is kind of limited. Even if the prediction is true and given enough warning ahead of time I have no means, and in most cases no need, to switch flights. For business travelers that have the expense accounts to make this work, this is a great tool.",1259064939

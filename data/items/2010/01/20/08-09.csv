1064398,comment,1063485,1064349,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> maybe one of you could show at least one example of a ""competent"" nation conquering disfunctional ones before building your complete world view on it.<p>Countries with a mix of a stable economy, advanced technology, and organized military regularly conquered their neighbors that didn't have those things. Countries with the tech/military but not the stable economy (USSR, for instance) could have a brief go at it, but inevitably came down upon themselves.<p>What sort of examples were you looking for? Nations with the combination advanced technology relative to their neighbors and a well organized military have done a lot of conquering throughout history, and those with stable economies held onto their new possessions. There's so many examples I wouldn't know where to start. Rome and all of its possessions would be a decent place, or one of the many functional or dysfunctional Russian Empires, or the Unification of Japan under the Oda, Toyotomi, and Tokugawa daimyos, or Manifest Destiny in the United States...<p>Those are just a few to come to mind with the economy/tech/military edges, but there's quite literally hundreds, from little tiny islands taking over other little tiny islands in Oceania to the various international powers/empires. Maybe the question is with the word competent? You do need a healthy economy, advanced technology, and stable military, which in turn requires some sort of decent courts, checks and balances on military rule, some science and production happening, and so on. Complicated question - could probably go on more if you clarified a bit.",1263977934

And while it's mostly a functional system (AFAIK, the US health system is horrible), it kind of bothers me that I pay lots of taxes without getting a return.<p>> <i>AFAIK, a good birth in a private hospital is around $1500, so he probably should have gone this way from the beginning.</i><p>Well, my wife is having complications ... we first went to a private clinic, and the doctor consulting us just shook his head with no advice for us, other than ""wait and see what happens"" ... and in a private clinic, it's more like $2000 for a normal birth ... and I've heard of a case when the doctor demanded a bribe anyway.<p>So to get proper treatment in this case ... we've had to go to the hospital in Giulesti, which has some of the best doctors available.<p>Now, of course, the doctor we ended up with (Puia Sorin in case you are interested :)), which is renowned for ""delivering babies"" :) ... treats his patients equally, the only problem being that he's too busy to take on new patients (fortunately, there are still some decent people left).",1263977710

1064386,comment,1064198,1064367,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This is both simpler, and more complicated than you'd think.<p>It is simpler, because there are a number of really good services that will accept mail on your behalf. I chose St. Brendan's Isle, and I pay less than $20 per month for all of my names (I get mail to both Joe and Ronald) and my business name. They scan the covers of all non-junk mail, and I can then request scans of the contents of the mail or physical forwarding (for a small per-piece fee). The fact that they'll simply recycle any junk mail I get, automatically, makes me wish I'd <i>always</i> used a service like this. I hate junk mail and I hate paper, so having everything shredded or digitized and never having paper except for what I explicitly ask for, is miraculous.<p>And it's more complicated than you'd think because the postal service requires a notarized form, along with multiple forms of ID (and those forms of ID beyond drivers license are strange, and I only had one of them, so it was a close call) in order to permit someone to open your mail. So you have to file a form for every name and business name that receives mail at the forwarding service.<p>My primary line of defense is to simply not get mail. I've switched to paperless statements from my bank and credit cards, I already had all of my other services setup with automatic withdrawal and such (and have canceled a lot of them).  Even so, California still sends me crap all the time about payroll taxes and such.<p>There will be other issues. I need to read up on operating in California now that our address is in Florida. Jamie is still in California, and will remain a CA resident (while I'll be claiming Florida as my home this year, for no state income tax and lower vehicle registration fees). I don't know what we'll do about our various taxes for the business.  We're a Delaware corporation, so that stays the same...but how we interact with California might change. I'll figure it out soon.<p>Another complication is that my new address is in a town I've never visited and in a state I haven't been to since I was a kid. I'll have to visit Florida at some point to register my RV and get my FL drivers license and voter registration. I should go visit the Wufoos, anyway, so this isn't a major hardship. But, it feels a little weird telling people my address and using it for billing address and such.",1263977444

1064360,comment,1061550,1062983,0,0,charlesr,,,"""Programming is a left-brain endeavor, designing utilizes the right side of the brain.""<p>Sorry, that's a myth. Both engage both sides of the brain. Most of what we do involves both sides of the brain. There are plenty of books around busting the myth that 'some people are left brain and some people are right brained'. Programming involves much of what is associated with 'right brain thinking': leaps of intuition, random thoughts, synthesis, looking at the bigger picture. While 'designing' (by which I take you to mean 'aesthetic design'?) involves much of what is associated with 'left brain thinking': analytical, objective, rational, logic.<p>What many folk do not realise is that 'design' is mostly something technical that can be learned. It's a set of rules, guidelines, processes and techniques that can be taught and practised. It's not some magical, right-brain, talent you're born with, it is something that is learned, practised and honed.<p>Sass is, in my experience, no harder to learn than HTML or CSS. Much easier, in fact if you already know CSS. It's nowhere near as complex as, say, Javascript or PHP, which most web designers seem to be able to handle to some degree. If a web designer (as in someone who specialises in HTML, CSS, graphic design, typography, IA) finds it too hard or complex, they either need to practice more, or find another career, because they're going to be redundant pretty soon as CSS and HTML get more complex with the transition to HTML5 and CSS3.",1263976042

I would guess that Eric Schmidt's involvement as a member of Apple's boar of directors and Google's involvement providing services for the iPhone starting in 2007, presumably as one of the first outside parties to see it, are the real problem here. Google must have realized how far ahead Apple was. They looked at the other companies in that space and figured Apple was a company they were ideologically compatible with. They were happy to offer search/maps on a product they could see was going to be a game changer. As a result they may have signed some non-competes to get on the iPhone early, or at least fear that Eric Schmidt's past involvement at Apple is a major legal risk and are playing it safe. It <i>is</i> a bit evil to be on the board of directors of one company, have a partnership with them, and turn around and use all the same technologies in your own product a year later. I imagine there are some sunsets on whatever arrangement Apple & Google have or Google, out of their own sense of fairness, is simply not pushing the issue yet.

Amazon has a somewhat better chance of pulling that off since they don't have to ignite a fraud clusterfuck by giving out cash to get users like Paypal did. More importantly, their users have much less incentive to cashout since they know that <i>the store of all stores</i> will take it.<p>But the interest they could make on the float is nothing compared to the tithes they pay to the credit card companies, especially with the damn rewards cards. Just getting their prime customers to sign up for EFT, for normal Amazon purchases, has got to be worth a fuckton of money to them.",1263975172

(which is not the case). The guy is an official TSA blogger. And I sense more exasperation in his entry, than mocking. Also ""harassed"" is a little harsh. The Airport security screening system is far from perfect. But the actual agents at the airport have no choice but to screen a person, when there is a match, or a near match on someone's name. They have been told to err on the side of caution (after the Underwear bomber security breach).<p>I request the person who posted this entry to edit the title and make it less sensational.",1263975004

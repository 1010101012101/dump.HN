Thousands, who might have been otherwise neutral or supportive of our cause, but not if we visibly and purposefully strive to kill their source of income.<p>Propaganda is something we aren't the best at, but Hollywood most definitely is.

It is possible that this background would convince a recruiter that advice which is against your interests is still a good idea, because if he adopts advice which will predictably results in employees underpricing themselves, his conversion rate from interviews to paychecks will improve, possibly dramatically.  If his placements are routinely leaving $10k on the table, that only costs him $3k per placement, which might on a subconscious level either a) not be motivational or b) might be a totally rational decision because of the increased volume of placements he gets by advising people to take any reasonable deal.<p>My father is a real estate agent, and real estate agents have demonstrable blind spots (seriously, academic literature exists on this) for negotiation when negotiating for clients versus when selling their own homes.

That's really interesting. I was actually going to give this a try because of Robert Pirsig, who wrote <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>. Here's how he did it:<p><i>In a 1974 interview with National Public Radio, Pirsig stated that the book took him four years to write. During two of these years, Pirsig continued working at his job of writing computer manuals. This caused him to fall into an unorthodox schedule, waking up very early and writing Zen from 2 a.m. until 6 a.m., then eating and going to his day job.</i> [1]<p>Funny he also writes technical literature (computer manuals versus technical magazine editor).<p>> <i>the early hours are definitely some of my most creative time</i><p>This is something I've noticed too. When writing (usually essays, but sometimes code), I'm almost always more productive very late night/early morning.

You mentioned above about the goal of increasing comment quality that ""There's a lot we already do about it, and probably other techniques that are yet undiscovered. This is somewhat uncharted territory."" I'll renew a suggestion here that I think would be helpful.<p>I've been a moderator one place or another online since 1993, and I've seen a lot of online discussion forums attempt to acculturate newbies to civil, thoughtful discussion. One of the most helpful practices that I have observed over the years is making sure that people who use factual assertions to back a position in a discussion are accountable for where one would look up the facts to verify them and ensure they are not made up. (A HUGE percentage of all real-world discourse about controversial issues is based on made-up factual premises.) With that in mind, I'm trying to encourage a culture here of asking people for sources when they make a factual assertion, and providing sources in a first comment when there sources on the issue. (I try to stud most of my comments with links to sources to exemplify this.) So any time any of us see a comment that is dumb, an essential thing to do is to ask the person who made the dumb comment what the basis for the comment is. (""Do you have a source for that?"" or the more abrupt ""[citation needed]"" as occasion demands, or ""What about [detail of assertion]?"" if that is better for raising the quality of the discussion.) Another thing to do is to share the growing online literature about evaluating sources, such as my very favorite link for Hacker News discussions,<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>and links about constructive online participation.<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html</a><p>A lot of stupid comments (and, alas, I have a particular user's example in mind) result from the convenience of reading blogs rather than reading serious scholarly literature. And the paywalls around serious scholarly articles only exacerbate this problem. So I routinely upvote any comment that points to a reliable source, and especially comments that teach other HN participants how to find and access reliable sources.<p>In general, promoting an information-based culture here will have two effects that will help reduce the problem of dumb comments: (1) it will raise the karma and visibility of the better comments that include good information from reliable sources (or that ask for that as follow-ups to worse comments), and (2) it will be off-putting to people inclined to make it up when they are put to their proof for the things they say.",1327295779

Finished it then spent one month ""on bench"" waiting to get staffed on a project (all paid time).

I look for color inspiration on sites like cssmania.com and dribbble.com. I've used Adobe Kuler a few times. For design, gedit or EditPad Pro. The designs are from scratch but inspiration comes from the sites I mentioned. Sometimes I do rough mockups in Photoshop before I start writing the layout.",1327295175
3499162,comment,3497769,3498367,1,0,firemanx,,,"I can't speak to overall strategy, as that's above my pay grade, but I can say that I HAVE worked in that area and I think everybody here is really interested in getting into that.<p>At my last startup, we had a prototype going at my house where we had a specialized smart meter with relays attached to the hot water heater, and an internet enabled thermostat.  We could monitor, control and schedule peak load over the course of the day pretty easily.  It was pretty labor intensive to set everything up (it was mainly the tapping of the mains and running the relays to the hot water heater), but actually worked well based on some simple schedules. I estimated that I saved about 15 to 20% of my power bill once it was in place.<p>The great thing about all of this, is that like most internet applications, the benefits become more pronounced and easier to achieve at scale.  The more you can feed into a system, from both the supply side and the demand side, the better you can get at predicting and controlling the nature of the grid.  And that transitions into some pretty serious effects on the economics of the situation, without really needing any major technology breakthroughs.",1327295132

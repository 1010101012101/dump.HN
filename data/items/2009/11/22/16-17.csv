In a perfect market, profit margins represent value perceived.<p>If your product will save me 10$ but costs you 2$ to produce, charging 5$ is beneficial to both of us.</i><p>Except that in a maximally competitive market, someone else would quickly come along and offer to sell you an equivalent product for $4, and then someone else comes along, etc. Competition always pushes prices towards the cost of production.<p>Of course, cost of production varies as well. In an idealized sense, the cost to produce a product is proportional to the amount produced (due to scarcity), whereas everyone in the market has some price limit below which they would want to buy the product. At a given price point, if the cost of producing an additional unit is below the highest price limit among people who wouldn't buy the product otherwise, it's a net gain for me to make the product and sell it to the person with that limit. Of course, at any price point, there's some people who want the product but not enough to pay that price, and some people who would happily pay more; but that's just the system working as intended.<p>The end result (in theory) is that every product eventually settles at a price point reflecting optimal resource allocation to production, plus some small profit margin to make the time spent on the transaction worthwhile.<p>In practice, it's... a bit more complicated.",1258908191

955874,story,,,1,0,gfodor,"Video processing in the cloud from your iPhone with Videomatic",,"I thought HN might be interested in my iPhone app, Videomatic. It lets you dub in sound effects, music, and add full-length video effects to videos on the iPhone 3GS. It's built entirely on the cloud using GAE and EC2 -- the system costs $0.00 to run when no users are using the app and scales up appropriately based upon usage. This ""0 cost for 0 usage"" dynamic makes it literally stress-free for me to run as a hobby.<p>I think this app showcases the potential for cloud-based processing from mobile phones. Often, cloud computing is thought of as a data-centric idea, giving remote access to data available universally. While it is, I think there are a class of apps such as Videomatic that see the cloud as a massive CPU. The philosophy of the app is to take advantage of the mobile phone (touch screen, mobile camera) where it shines, and use the cloud for the CPU-bound processing tasks.<p>Of course, simpler video effects could be done on the phone directly. But, for full length effects and audio mixing such as this, the cloud based approach seems more convenient and scalable. As I get fancier and add more effects, such as frame-level transformations and Photoshop-like filters, it would have been more and more tough for the 3GS CPU to process the video in a practial amount of time. Videomatic does it asynchronously on the cloud with push notifications, so you can use your phone while the video is being composed.<p>Would love to hear ideas and feedback on this, and any ideas for what cool things this approach could offer for future effects based upon the fact it is not processed on the phone. The app is free with 3 effects (slow motion, fast forward, and reverse) and there are currently 3 effects that can be purchased for $1 each from within the app. All of them let you dub in 100+ sound effects and a few dozen music loops. As the app grows, I'll be adding more fancier effects. Thanks!<p>http://www.vidmint.com/videomatic",1258907933

I learned that unless you are trading at least a million dollars a trade it's very unlikely that you will make money.<p>The reason for this is that the large companies won't talk to you unless you're trading at those volumes since they charge pretty high transaction fees. The smaller companies that will talk to you all have accounts with the larger companies and make money by increasing the spread between the bid and ask price they receive from the large companies. The expected return on a trade is usually somewhere in the region of 1-10 pips (where a pip is one ten thousandth of a dollar), with 10 pips being a really good return and 3-4 being more realistic. The smaller companies usually increase the spread by up to 3 pips in each direction on the price they get from the larger company which swallows up your return.<p>While millions of dollars per trade might sound like a lot the leverage in this market is also very high at 50-100 times meaning that with your 10k you could trade 500k-1M though on a sum that low you might get less leverage. However if you lose money on a trade you could eat substantially into your capital. So if your $1M trade goes against you by 10 pips you'd lose 1k.<p>I'm not ruling out making money on that market, but I'd say it's very unlikely unless you have a lot more money to start with.

955862,comment,955653,955789,0,0,Mz,,,"I lived for 4 1/2 years in an apartment that had to be gutted and inspected by some environmental office or other prior to me moving in.  Anytime I took a hot shower or boiled water on the stove, brown goo ran down the walls that smelled like cigarette tar.  While living there, I ended up bedridden for about 3 1/2 months and spent about a year at death's door.  I had a long history of respiratory and other health issues which had been largely blown off by doctors for most of my life.  This crisis led to a cutting edge diagnosis of ""atypical cystic fibrosis"" (relatively mild compared to the traditional diagnosis, but still potentially deadly).<p>While living there, I was frequently in the ER.  I went through a couple of periods where I ended up in the ER very routinely, within about 48 hours of coming off of antibiotics.  Doctors told me point blank that ""people like you don't get well"".  I had managed my condition without a diagnosis for many years (I was nearly 36 when I was diagnosed) so, in frustration with getting no real support from doctors, I began doing my own research and trying to improve on what I was already doing.<p>Eventually, I found that when I could feel a crisis coming on and was clearly deteriorating, washing all the curtains and throw rugs and so forth sometimes was effective in keeping me out of the ER.  Eventually I concluded that if I did more washing proactively instead of waiting for a crisis, maybe I could avoid those crises altogether.  This led to a period of some months where I spent all day Saturday, every Saturday in a laundromat washing about 20 loads of laundry. Yes, my health improved.  But I felt like I had no life and was simply a slave to my possessions.  I also began to be outraged at the idea that I had spent more money in just a few weeks on washing a throw rug than it would cost to replace it.  I began cavalierly throwing out throw rugs and replacing them fairly frequently.  Then I decided throw rugs were non-essential items and one could live without them.  So were curtains.  I began tossing out such belongings rather then spend all my time, energy and money trying to keep them clean enough to keep me out of the ER.<p>This led to me concluding that if all this washing could help keep me out of the ER, maybe it wasn't just my genes making me sick. Maybe it was also my possessions.  I can't change my genes but I can change my relationship to my material possessions.  I soon became determined to toss out anything in the apartment that was making me sick.  Ultimately, I concluded that everything that had ever been in that apartment needed to go.  I methodically threw it all out over the course of several years.<p>I initially had fantasies that I would get rid of the contaminated items and then get new things which were more spartan and low maintenance.  I figured my lifestyle would look fairly conventional but with a clean, modern decor.  That was not to be.  To this day, I own very little.  We (my sons and I -- the oldest of whom has the same diagnosis) have had repeated experiences proving to us how negatively papers impact our welfare.  So we just don't go there.<p>I think this principle generalizes more than most people would like to believe.  At one point, I snuck into an empty cubicle at work and removed 3 linear feet of papers left there (covered in dust and essentially rotting in place).  I trashed some and redistributed others back to the supply room.  Within 2 days of that, I stopped needing to keep Dayquil in my desk at work.  But also within 2 days of that, two individuals who shared a wall with the cubicle I cleaned out stopped being ill with a chronic cough and respiratory infections, in spite of the fact that they had been steadily deteriorating and their doctors didn't know why.",1258907153

When everyone customizes their online environment and interacts with a tight nit group of friends, the polite conversation goes down and everyone is back to sharing lolcat images and inane chatter about their day. Then, any advertising that appears in one's ""personal"" space will either need to conform to one's tastes, or risk looking like a billboard in someone's living room.<p>A cozy friendly environment would be LinkedIN's undoing, so they need to force a cold, uniform corporate image throughout.<p>FWIW, if I am appraising[1] a site for CPM, along with traffic data, overall CTR and demographic data, I would also look at the image of the site. A high-end magazine-y website with staff graphic designers, quality content, and general ""posh"" atmosphere will get higher CPM than an spartan, community-den of a website that's entirely UGC driven. Advertisers prefer sites with strict editorial control with minimal UGC, both for brand-safety and also for improved perception of advertising (not only are ads taken for granted in print publishing, but they also constitute a good portion of the <i>content</i>; when people buy magazines to see ads and keep up with trends, the advertisers can count on being seen and their brands recognized, even if there is no immediate conversion, it's the brand-awareness that counts.)<p>--<p>[1]Boutique niche ad-networks need to manually vet websites; if you think your CPM is computer generated, you are either wrong or using crap like adsense (or a bottom-feeder, 2nd-tier network with lousy inventory; web hosting ads on your finance blog ;-)",1258906404

Lifespan of a pro brass instrument is less than a decade - the sound really does drop off.

Most pros replace their brass every 3-5 years, if not less.<p>Picking up a brand new brass instrument for a top player and playing it perfectly is totally logical.

955839,comment,955702,955702,0,0,copernicus,,,"In general, machine learning would probably not be a great approach to day trading. There are several problems:<p>1) Limited market data: As an individual, you have limited access to market data. At best, you probably have real time top of book data but without paying for it, you almost certainly aren't getting a real time depth feed. Going off of only last trade data gives you even less to work with. In most cases free quotes are delayed making them worthless to day traders (although not longer term investors).<p>2) Limitations of market data: Even if you have a lot of historical data with a full order book, that is still of limited utility for simulations. The problem is that everything you do affects the market so any trade you simulate needs to be doing small enough quantity to not make your simulation unreasonable. How to deal with simulating market-affecting trades is a complex problem and the only way to truly know is to run your trades in the market.<p>3) For day trading, there is a lot of profit to be captured simply from the microstructure of the market (its moves back and forth, etc.). To capture much of this it helps to be fast but you won't be able to colo boxes at an exchange with only 10K.<p>Machine learning seems more suited to longer term investments and trading on a slower platform than making a quick profit arbing or scalping. You may want to consider this rather than day trading since not only does day trading require much larger amounts of capital, but its also extremely risky.<p>Also, if you plan to trade equities, enjoy all of the ridiculous SEC regulation (order marking, etc.).",1258906146

Then one day she accidentally dragged the main toolbar offscreen, and was no longer able to open, save, or print...<p>- Corollary to above -- she avoids menus, since they appear to her as a hierarchical wall of text full of jargon.

Now all you need is some sort of messaging layer such that different clients can talk to your server. Preferably implemented in different programming language and with clustering capabilities. You could of course create such a messaging framework all by yourself, but that is a lot of hard work.<p>A simple solution is to just implement your database as a ZeroMQ server and pick a message protocol (fe JSON).

The current overtime procedure of extra time + penalties is the best of many mediocre options, and I suspect future innovations will lead to better procedures.<p>When you look at the reality of match congestion in top level clubs, you have situations where you may have to play 3-4 matches a week at times, when 1-2 matches a week is the most a player can reasonably recover from. As a result of that, clubs already have to prioritize which competitions they care about--a club simultaneously competes for a league, more than one domestic cup, and maybe even an international cup or two, so ""less important"" competitions like the English League Cup and even, in recent years, the English FA Cup aren't taken seriously by some top clubs.

When we go from 40 hours to 60, productivity rises temporarily, then falls.  The fifth crunch time week is even less productive than a standard 40 hour week.  After 2 months, the benefits of the first week are cancelled out.  Finally, when we go back to 40 hours a week, productivity plummets, then rises to it's standard level.<p>But the most interesting thing is that long term <i>perceived</i> productivity is higher at 60 hours a week than at 40.  Because of that, it is very difficult to realize that overtime is a mistake (emergencies aside).<p>I would also understand that not all people are alike.  Some may be most productive at 35 hours a week.  Some may be most productive at 50.  But 60 hours sound like much.  Maybe you could try to work even less for a month and see the results?

1455311,comment,1454704,1454704,0,0,gruseom,,,"Wow, I have to pipe up here. The commenters so far are completely missing the point of this article. The author is making two observations, both of which are quite correct in my experience. First, the mainstream MS developer universe -- the overwhelming majority of it -- is parochial. People learn new things when MS release some new technology and not before. (I'm talking about the smart ones here. The mediocre ones don't bother learning.) Back when I was an MS programmer, the place to learn new things was MSDN Magazine. There is very little interest in looking outside the village gates; in fact it tags you as a little weird. This phenomenon is so well-established that I'm surprised anyone would deny it. I've commented about it on HN many times myself.<p>The second and main point is that since this large programmer population receives its knowledge almost exclusively from MS, it's a really good thing that MS have started teaching functional programming. It's probably the best chance FP has ever had to break into the mainstream. Even if it takes over just a corner of the MS world, that corner is probably larger than the rest of FP put together. This is a really good thing, and it massively kicks the ass of the crap that MS used to feed their ""Elvises"" and probably still do.<p>I'll add a third point. We know why this is happening. It's because a little less than 15 years ago, MS changed their direction, acquired some top-notch people (starting with Hejlsberg), and started moving in a direction more informed by CS and PL theory. This process is slow, but good. One can finally see it yield real fruit in the form of F# and the recent enhancements to C#. People like Meijer are having a very real influence. Come to think of it, that's probably why people like Meijer went to MS to begin with.",1277309519

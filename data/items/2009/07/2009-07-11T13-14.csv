It's profoundly disrespectful -- a debating tactic to avoid confronting the opinions of those with whom you disagree, or listening to their arguments.<p>I can understand how someone could reasonably believe that there <i>are</i> things that we intelligent beings could never control (the spinning of a galaxy or something), but it seems really odd on a tech-oriented site to find those who not only don't agree that we could control natural phenomena on this one little rock, but who don't believe that any argument worth listening to could exist, such that they're calling for the <i>education</i> of those who disagree, rather than the convincing of those people.",1247320436

699162,comment,698518,698684,0,0,alan-crowe,,,"Think about the Great War, that is World War One. It was for a while a war of attrition with Britain and France trying to bleed Germany white. It was truly terrible in a way that modern terrorism can never hope to be. So terrorists try to terrify even though they fall far short of being truly terrible. They are attempting a mindfuck, one that is mostly smoke and mirrors, with only 0.01% of the blood and gore of WWI.<p>The bathos of becoming unfunny practical jokers would destroy a terrorist movement. The terrorist must conduct himself so that, in the eyes of his victims, he is a fierce warrior who, when captured, has claims to the status of prisoner of war or political prisoner. If his victims are not frightened but are very annoyed then they will turn on him, sedate him heavily and lock him in the ward for the mentally retarded who are violent.<p>Bruce Schneier finds fault with the authorities saying that they defend us against 'movie plot' threats. I don't accept this criticism. Terrorist are constrained to operate within a socially constructed mythos that is mostly owned by their victims. Terrorists have to conduct attacks that have Hollywood's stamp of approval as 'terrorism'. Hollywood has no latitude on where it places its stamp of approval; it goes on visceral, primal dread, not left luggage.",1247319912

699157,comment,698929,699023,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Typically ""frequency"" means the same thing: something that is repeated over time. I'll mention a specific economic example I've seen (sorry, can't recall exactly where) to illustrate.<p>Economists wanted to explain a productivity gap between male and female employees at some employer. So after looking at the Fourier transform of timeseries of sick days, they noticed that men's sick days behaved like a bump function near 0. Essentially, if you are sick today, this increases the odds of him being sick tomorrow.<p>On the other hand, the Fourier transform of women's sick days had spikes at f=1/28 days as well as the bump at 0. This means if a woman is sick today, the odds are increased that she will be sick n x 28 days from now (n an integer).<p>That's what the Fourier transform does: if your signal has a component which repeats over time, the Fourier transform will find it.",1247319527

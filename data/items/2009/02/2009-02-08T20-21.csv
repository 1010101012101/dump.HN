472467,comment,472327,472362,0,0,Jebdm,,,"I think he was just trying to explain the difference which we intuitively see between the two kinds languages he lists, because it's not obvious what exactly the difference is.<p>One of these groups he calls the ""puzzle languages"" and the others are ""not puzzle languages"".  Puzzle languages are usually clearly oriented toward one particular way of doing things; trying to use a different way sometimes works, but is usually fairly fragile and almost always out of place.  This can be intentional or unintentional; Haskell's purity is an example of intentional limits, while the ugliness of using function pointers in C is an example of an unintentional (perhaps?) one.  Converting from the original solution to a cleaner one is the ""puzzle"".  The advantage of this is that, if you learn to use the constructs in the way the language ""wants"" you to, your code will be nicer and you will be able to be more productive.<p>On the other hand, the not-puzzle languages don't limit you as much.  There is little stigma associated with doing things in any particular way, and often the methods considered ""dirty"" in puzzle languages are the easiest or accepted way.  There is often a ""cleaner"" method of doing things, but the language and the language's culture don't try to push you towards it.  This can make the non-puzzle languages somewhat easier to work with, because they don't push more complex abstractions on you, but as a result they lose some of the expressiveness which forcing abstractions can give.<p>I'd disagree with him for making such a strict distinction between the two.  It's a bit of a spectrum, based on the degree to which the languages try to restrict you.  For instance, one (debatable) ordering of some languages is Javascript, Perl, Python, Java, Assembly, Haskell.  Note that these distinctions don't necessarily convey the existence of high-level abstractions within the languages; it only conveys the degree to which they attempt to force you into whatever abstractions they have.  (In fact, it seems that the less puzzle-y languages tend to support a wider variety of abstractions.)<p>I don't think the idea of puzzle-yness captures the distinction quite like he wanted it to, but it nonetheless is an interesting idea.",1234126500

If it's not meaningless to ask what a dollar 50 years ago was worth in present terms, then it isn't meaningless to ask about further back.  E.g. the answer would appear not to be a trillion, or a trillionth.<p>However, while this seems to be the view of most economists, I think it's meaningless to ask even what the value of a dollar 50 years ago was, because we are so much richer now.  A dollar now can buy you computing power that would have been unthinkable then, cures for diseases that were then incurable, and so on.

One of the sites got back to me and said they have a huge backlog of apps to review, but they could guarantee mine a review for $50. Furthermore, if the review wasn't positive, they said they wouldn't publish it and they'd give me my money back.<p>First of all, is this standard practice in the App world? I had seen reports that this is common on domain registrar / hosting review sites but had no idea iPhone app review sites were working on payola also.<p>Second of all, is this a worthwhile investment? This is my first app and as an independent developer I don't have an advertising budget to speak of, but positive reviews seem to be really valuable for gaining exposure, and this site ranks high on Google searches (this was actually one of the selling points they mentioned). Maybe $50 is a small amount compared to how much traffic this might bring? On the other hand, I don't want to do business with a site that is dishonest to its readers, and there are other review sites out there that may run a review without asking for cash in return.<p>Thanks in advance for your advice!",1234123916

I changed it to ""a biblical literalist.""</i><p>Whether it was intentional or not, your [2] paragraph there seems to reveal part of your own identity with the scientific community, primarily because of the way it was phrased.  It reads as if the scientist is completely and entirely committed to the rational, while cleverly mentioning that those identifying with religion clearly toss the evidence out of the window.<p>Of course the literalist does this because his world-view does not permit it, but this sophistry ignores the larger picture that both the scientist and the literalist hold equally irrational worldviews -- one in scientific naturalism and one in the Bible + scientific empiricism.<p>Both world-views are far from grounded in complete rationality and both world-views function on powerful assumptions that hardly qualify either individual as completely rational, a distinct difference from how your paragraph depicts the two individuals.  I think robg states it best here:

Was that intentional, or was it a little bit of personal identity peeking through in your writing?<p>This is not my attempt to ""read into"" your writing, but given this context of personal identity (which we know both consciously and subconsciously shapes everything we do), I was interested to know if your writing here was shaped by your own identity.  I'm pretty confident it was, given that you're definitely not trying to deceive anyone here, but you are certainly providing a slanted view on reality.",1234123903

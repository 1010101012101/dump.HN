Now we only need to create such laws that pollution is greatly diminished.<p>This will naturally lead to creation of lots of ecological niches for new startups, that will find the most efficient means to achieve these reductions. Naturally government funded long term research will also play a part in finding good solutions.<p>The end customer will naturally pay for these changes. For example, it is cheaper to run transport ships with residue heavy fuel oil, the use of which has been banned almost everywhere else already. If we want to prevent that, we make laws that make it illegal. Then the ships will use some other, naturally more expensive fuel. The transport costs will go up and whatever you buy that was imported costs more, or whatever you export potentially pays less.",1387803516

To extend the range the polynomial must have more terms, so the “accurate” version doesn’t run in constant time.

The complete analysis is complex and I don’t have enough time to do it.<p>The recursive functions runs in linear time only for small numbers. It uses only integer arithmetic that is faster.

I get the feeling that the first language of &#x27;Jack&#x27; is probably highly idiomatic and frequently uses allusion and/or euphamisms.  Also using the threat of the government power, rather than direct force (mafia et alia who more frequently carry out blackmail), while simultaneously engaging in clearly illegal behaviour.  I would suspect this means this person&#x27;s origins would be a country with high levels of government corruption and/or dictatorship.  All together I would hedge that this person came from China (linguistical match, corruption match, huge population, national interest in Bitcoin), Vietnam, or maybe Laos or Cambodia.  Obviously this is all conjecture of the highest order.",1387800632

Legal, in that I&#x27;d like to see enough pushback to demonstrate widespread belief in the fundamental <i>wrongness</i> of mass surveillance, and technical, in the form of systems to enforce the inability to tap communications at any point other than the two endpoints.  I&#x27;d like to see our networks and communication protocols designed to make it impossible to spy on traffic between two parties without either the consent and cooperation of one party or an ongoing security breach of the physical systems of one party.

They throw a lot of stuff against the wall that is original, and some of it does stick. The Galaxy Note was ridiculed by everybody but turned out to be a hit. The large size and stylus turn out to be a big selling features to people you wouldn&#x27;t expect (eg: small women seem to love galaxy notes - because they were never able to fit a phone in their pocket in the first place, and many are used to carrying around a paper diary that is almost the same size anyway). They certainly copy a lot of stuff from Apple (and others) where they think that&#x27;s the right path, but it&#x27;s unfair to say they add nothing new.<p>> I&#x27;m an Apple shareholder, and I am not worried about Samsung<p>I&#x27;d go so far as to say that your kind of viewpoint might well be dominant inside Apple itself, and the &quot;blind spot&quot; it creates might be a major reason why Apple has struggled to compete against Samsung.",1374979458

It does type inference, which means you don&#x27;t have to explicitly type everything to get type checking help. You can do as little or as much type checking as you would like. Regular unadorned JavaScript code is TypeScript code and will compile. The compiler will tell you when not all code paths return a value, when the wrong type is passed to a function, when a return value is the wrong type, etc...

I&#x27;m usually so overloaded by the mind expanding experience I just had, that&#x27;s the last thing I wanna do. I won&#x27;t do them more often that once a week, and I&#x27;m a highly addictive personality. actually, I&#x27;ve noticed that I tend to not want to drink alcohol, or ... well really anything addicting, and watched all addictive behavior reduce every time. I just want to create. I now neither need mushrooms anymore. the changes seem to be permanently enlightening.<p>I&#x27;ve not tried LSD (cause I can&#x27;t get it here), but I know that Jobs was a huge proponent of it. from what I can gather, the concept is similar.<p>I think, if you are somewhat grounded individual, I believe your experience will be something of exaggerated connection with nature, other humans, and your own creative ideas. perhaps it&#x27;s a bit illusory, but I have never seen a detrimental side-effect to redefining your connection with your immediate world with that sort of illusory connection.<p>you cannot overdose on mushrooms. I also found I am less inclined to simplistic forms of thoughtless hedonism, focusing a bit more on the bigger picture. I find that creativity and novelty are forefront in my mind for at least a few days afterwards, if not permanently.<p>compare that with alcohol, and I think you may rethink your next few mindless sloshers.<p>@neilk, I believe that the negative-positive experiences are actually the best.

Further, I think the idea of mass data collection is monstrous however there is nothing I, nor you can really do about that except perhaps hiding as much of our data as we can (via encryption). Even if our data is encrypted in the end if they want your data they can get your data.<p>The thing I find interesting about this article is the idea that eventually the internet could be closed off only to a few nation states. I disagree this would ever happen because Pandora&#x27;s box has been opened and some communication will always be allowed via wireless connections, hidden cables, or some other method. Obviously, the average user might be affected, but just like the soviet union fell so would what ever country decided to block off their nation.<p>People don&#x27;t care about surveillance for the most part, as someone already commented: &quot;I&#x27;ve talked to two people about this issue.

If they&#x27;re catching terrorists...&quot;&quot; They do however care if you disconnect their internet, and if any country was to do that in the end it would fail. The point being, the article stated that nation states of internet would develop and my reasoning points to that not happening (at least based off what i&#x27;ve seen). In my honest opinion, the internet has always been a place to communicate, but about as secure with my data as a friend you never quite trust with your secrets. What scares me is not the internet surveillance or my government hunting down (in my opinion) an innocent man. What horrifies me the most is that no matter what we do the surveillance will only become more intense (as the price of computing/computers gets lower) and there is no going back. 50 years from now, what am I going to be faced with and will I be able to continue to just ignore these B.S. laws we have, or if I unlock my cell phone will I really go to jail for 10 years?<p>That&#x27;s what thoughts keep me up at night, not the idea of my data being collected at mass online (although I would stop it if there was any way I could), but the idea that even offline walking down the street or in my own home I may be required to follow the laws which are outright ridiculous.",1374978129

TOP was published in 1987. Galfond was 2 years old at that time.<p>Galfond simply took a concept that already existed and popularized it.

The structure of the game is the same now as it was in the 80s, and the 50s, and 20s, and so on.<p>The vast majority of modern strategy content is a restatement or application of the content from two canonical texts: the aforementioned <i>Theory of Poker</i>, and Chen&#x27;s <i>Mathematics of Poker</i>.

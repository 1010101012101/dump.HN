All we are saying is that economics and free markets will eventually take care of the problem, and will result in much lesser useful content being created for people to consume. If one thinks that lesser content is better and the only ones allowed to publish content are big budget companies like Google who can afford to pay Adblock developers to be in the whitelist, then so be it.",1390053586

Or maybe they really generate actual useful content. If we&#x27;re discussing anecdotal data points everyone has a different view on a website&#x27;s utility.<p>Personally I believe if the reader base of a site is genuine and not heavily dependent on one-hit readers, they shouldn&#x27;t rely on an ad-driven model. At least, not solely. Call it guilt-tripping, donation driving, paywalling, microtransactions, anything you will. As long as it&#x27;s not the ad networks actually asking for dosh.

But as soon as you get a sizeable codebase, you have zillions of functions just waiting to explode your call stack in ways you could never expect.<p>Exceptions do not &quot;explode your call stack&quot;, and any function can fail in ways both documented and undocumented. Consistent use of exceptions that derive from a small and well-chosen set of base classes means that callers can choose where and how to respond to categories of errors, instead of being forced to litter all code with error handling conditionals. I have worked on large applications that made the transition to using exceptions, and when combined with strict RAII and other best practices, the effect is absolutely to make code easier to understand and much more robust.",1390052825

Maintainability is all about good documentation, neat code, sensible peer-reviewed code, a good dose of manual testing and a healthy injection of personal responsibility in seeing the project be the best it can be for your users.<p>I test my work manually on a bunch of test devices and computers I own. It doesn&#x27;t take long and I get to see any browser specific display glitches that automation tools wouldn&#x27;t pick up. It&#x27;s a no-brainer, and you LEARN about the nature of browsers by testing manually.<p>I hate bootstrap, don&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;ve made big website templates with lots of traffic, and smaller components and other things. I don&#x27;t want bootstrap in the mix thanks. Whenever I have to maintain a project which someone else started with bootstrap, I sigh and dive into the ridiculous use of simulated rows and columns, and the crappy CSS overrides meant to give us flexibility, but actually giving us not much at all.<p>So how do other developers like my work when they have to maintain it? Well, I leave them something SIMPLE and well documented to decipher, so they can get straight to work doing the maintenance and getting on with business. No learning curves of countless toolsets and pre-processing junk. Just the basics. I&#x27;ve had no complaints.<p>Frontend is very much concerned with visual elements and interaction. I don&#x27;t know much about server side except for what I find behind the projects I work on and fetch with AJAX or other means... such and such data feeds, this or that outputs etc. I&#x27;m more interested in user interfaces and how a web app or webpage &quot;feels&quot;. I know exactly what to do when something doesn&#x27;t feel snappy, or a graphic flashes or renders poorly on load. I know what to do because I haven&#x27;t sold my soul to a framework that promised me the world, but delivered mediocrity.<p>Each to their own.",1390052728

Face it, if you&#x27;re using Adblock you&#x27;re on a default allow model and any previously spotless network can be compromised at any time since it only takes one malformed payload to get through the cracks to infect a user. It&#x27;s the same situation the AV vendors face. The only realistic option (whether the ad vendors like it or not) for a blocklist is to craft the regex to be as sweeping as possible.<p>On the other end of things the ad firms need to self-police themselves at a vastly increased level than what is happening now, preferrably under some sort of umbrella organization.

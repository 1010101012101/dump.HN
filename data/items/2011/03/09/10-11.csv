Two representative quotes are:<p>> Android is and has always been the choice for people and companies that don’t have the option of getting an iPhone.<p>>  iOS is, in fact, being used as a platform by Apple and independent developers, while Android is fulfilling the role that the simpler phone OSs used to<p>Speaking for myself (anecdotes != data, etc.) I bought my first Android phone because it was the most advanced phone at the time with a physical keyboard, and had great integration with Gmail. My organisation has a fairly even split between iPhone and Android, and there are a lot of non-geeks with Android phones. So such a general, sweeping statement dismissing Android as ""for people who can't have iPhones"" is incorrect and mildly amusing.<p>I agree with the author's point that most non-geeks do not care about the OS a phone is running, but the second quote above makes me think he/she has their iBlinkers on. Android phones range from cheap and cheerful to feature-packed shiny-fests. There are some Android devices that are less advanced than the iPhone, and some that are more advanced.<p>This, in my opinion, is Android's key strength - the wide variety of handsets means Android is engaging in asymmetric warfare with iPhone.<p>I hate the divisive nature of articles like this - it smacks of ""my toy is better than your toy"", although I suppose my response is little better than ""no, my toy is better than your toy, but let's agree to disagree"".",1299666048

2304465,comment,2302964,2304274,0,0,athom,,,"Thanks, but I got a little update: it won't work on strings.<p>The help says as much, in fact. Actually, what it says is, ""Returns the sum of a sequence of numbers (NOT strings),"" which I think is meant to imply it won't parse numbers out of strings, but in theory, sum should be able to concatenate strings as easily as it does lists, with the right start argument. Instead:<p><pre><code>  >>> sum([['room315'], ['room2']], [])\n  ['room315', 'room2']\n</code></pre>\nbut:<p><pre><code>  >>> sum(['room315', 'room2'], '')\n  TypeError: sum() can't sum strings [use ''.join(seq) instead]\n</code></pre>\nSay, what???<p>I'm not sure, but I think sum is specifically watching for strings, and throwing a TypeError if it finds one. Otherwise, if it's simply using the + operator internally, as its list-handling behabior seems to imply, it should mash strings together just as happily! Oh, well. The join function <i>is</i> the right one for that job. It just seems a bit of wasted effort, to me.",1299665467

Post a bunch (1000-5000) of cheap multiple-choice HITs.\n2. Allow no more than 10 hits per worker.\n3. Each hit to get 3 responses from different workers.\n4. Review answers, compile the list of ""good"" workers, blacklist the ""bad"" ones.\n5.

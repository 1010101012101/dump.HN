There are too many opportunities for police to stop motorists, which they use to pivot and further impinge upon peoples&#x27; freedom. It is a common tactic for police to stop motorists for any of a number of reasons such as this reason as a tactic to initiate a search of their vehicle, and record the identities of driver and passengers. I am glad that cars are equipped with seat belts, and of course it is wise to use them; but I disagree that the state has much or any legitimacy in stopping a motorist who was causing no negative effect on other motorists simply because their seat belt was not visible. At its worst (and commonly) the seat belt requirement is abused by greedy entities to drum up extra revenue to which they would otherwise not be entitled.",1431467769

It can be hard to see them (particularly when you&#x27;re young and haven&#x27;t had a lot of practice interacting with people), but the more you get out and make socially awkward mistakes, the more you can form a mental model of what&#x27;s likely to be offensive and what&#x27;s safe.<p>I agree that it&#x27;s not worth constantly worrying about what other people think of you, but it turns out that&#x27;s not usually what other people are expecting anyways.  Rather, it&#x27;s just that when you make a mistake, apologize, try not to make it again, and move on.  Everybody makes mistakes - I&#x27;ve seen some folks I consider very socially adept make pretty embarrassing gaffes.

Its a bit of a science experiment so don&#x27;t get discouraged if the first medication you try doesn&#x27;t work very well. I also recommend that you ask to try a set of them to determine what is the most effective for you. I have taken them all until I found the one that worked the best for me.  Starting with Adderall, then Ritalin, and finally Vyvanse.  At this point I take one 70mg Vyvanse capsule a day.  While Adderall and Vyvanse are quite similar, the major difference is that Vyvanse is not a stimulant until it is metabolized by the liver.  For me this results in a smoother transition on and off, with the duration lasting 10 hours or so.  Adderall didn&#x27;t last nearly as long (8 hours or less) and I became a bit of a jerk as it wore off.  (They don&#x27;t call it &quot;Madderall&quot; for nothing).<p>I want to emphasize though that none of these medications will cure you.  If you want to see the biggest change, then combine the medication, exercise, quality sleep, and a good diet.  Last, learn all that you can about ADHD, how it effects your relationships with others (you would be surprised), along with how other people with ADHD go about getting things done in spite of the disorder.",1431467642

The thing is, pixels aren&#x27;t square. In fact, when we played it on the SNES, it was rendered very differently, it was interlaced, scanlines were distinct, and each pixel was a bit of a blob.<p>Because of this, an image like Yoshi looked just fine, because we weren&#x27;t looking at a blocky grid of squares.  The brighter colored glowed around the darker colors, the darkness between the scanlines caused your brain to interpolate the lines.  We got a nicer looking image.<p>When you blow it up to 500% on a crisp LCD panel it doesn&#x27;t look the same.  What used to be smooth lines are now stair steps. And just the same way that he complains about Auro being blurred or stretched, when you display pixel art designed for a CRT on an OLED display at 600% nearest neighbor scaling, it doesn&#x27;t work.<p>I like the symbolic style of pixel art. But we don&#x27;t have the same limitations.  When people made great art for the NES, it&#x27;s because that&#x27;s what they had to work with.  We have more to work with.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to represent things in a symbolic, simplistic or minimalistic style.  It&#x27;s another thing to feign technological disadvantage.",1431467460

Windows UX was never a paragon of design clarity so adding sparsity to accommodate for touch is nothing new in the world of Windows which has seen other transgressions far worse.

2. The big media companies are not willing to consider releasing content without DRM
3. Nobody likes maintaining plugins or the lower video quality they entail
4. Apple, Google and Microsoft made it clear that they were going to solve #3 by implementing whatever Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, etc. need to
5. The W3C and Mozilla accepted #4 and used what power they do have to push the process into a public forum. Mozilla has been particularly active to increase user awareness and make it more obvious when your actions are being restricted at a content owner&#x27;s bequest.<p>There was no step where someone waves a magic wand and Hollywood stops demanding DRM.<p>With or without a W3C spec, most desktop users and nearly all mobile users were going to have a browser with DRM playback features.

9535065,comment,9534921,9534921,0,0,dalke,,,"Perhaps, but unlikely. There are many levels of &quot;know no math.&quot; I used to tutor math at a university. There were some people who had difficulty with pre-algebra, as in &quot;simplify 4 + 5x + 2 + 3x&quot;. If you don&#x27;t know how to add two things together, then that&#x27;s different than someone who can do grade school arithmetic, but that latter is certainly more than &quot;no math.&quot;<p>What do you mean by &quot;calc&quot;? It&#x27;s a broad category with several centuries of formalization behind it. Basic concepts of summation leading to integration, like what Euclid did in ancient Greece, or differentiation as the slope of a line, can be learned after a college algebra course. But at that point the calculus is pretty hand-wavy. A more serious understanding depends on more rigorous formalisms, like epsilon-delta proofs.<p>So I would go there by trying to figure out if there&#x27;s a specific goal in mind, or a bare minimum of what counts as sufficient understanding. I would also figure out if &quot;one year&quot; means 5 minutes per day on average, or 6 hours per day.<p>There are also any number of books that teach calculus to the mathematically inexperience. However, I have no experience with them.",1431466373

9535052,comment,9534310,9534942,0,0,drzaiusapelord,,,"To be fair, this is also incredibly exhausting. Most peoples&#x27; reactions to things are arbitrary at best and constant worrying about how they will take something is just way too much BS to put into my day. I bought pretty deeply into this philosophy once and it just made me neurotic and quiet at a time of my life where those things very much hurt me.<p>I think being selectively kind makes a lot more sense. I&#x27;m kind to children and animals and my loved ones. People at work, retail staff, etc should be prepared to not have their emotions constantly validated and deal with disagreement and other things that are unpleasant.<p>I&#x27;m not one of those &quot;grow a thick skin, jerk&quot; types, but there&#x27;s this cheap sentiment I see about how everyone needs to be more kind and compassionate, and when its not phoned in, it usually ends up as a way to take advantage of others. Its easy for celebrity millionaire Kurt Vonnegut to write about compassion and be quoted by tumblerinas  and its totally another thing for some kid no one gives a shit about trying to make his way in the world try to live it.<p>I find high-concept philosophies are often the playthings of the well-off and comfortable. If you&#x27;re fighting for your living, its not a luxury most of us can have.  Sadly, this often justifies hostility, but I think there&#x27;s a sane middle-ground here, but curt statements like &quot;be kind&quot; just seems so classist and off-putting to me. Like a soccer mom telling me how wonderful the Maharishi is or how relaxing doing 4 hours of Yoga is (no, she doesnt work, her husband does) and after I got off a long shift and dealt with a lot of shit and a crappy commute.<p>Cheap sentiment just doesn&#x27;t resolve the fundamental issue facing humanity today and probably until our final extinction event: we are all competing for the very same resources and competition can sometimes be ugly. It doesn&#x27;t need to be truly awful and we shouldn&#x27;t be encouraged to be overly negative and vindictive, but conflict and disagreement happens on a certain level and pretending we can kindly make it go away is just being unrealistic about our fundamental economic beings. Kindness is often taken advantage of as one party feels obligated to engage in it moreso than the other. This is a fairly large problem in gender politics where we raise women to be kind and then they find themselves at a disadvantage to men in the workplace who don&#x27;t have these values.<p>Considering everyone here is visiting a hard-nosed libertarian-leaning entrepreneur forum about becoming wealthy quickly, but the second something pseudo-spiritual gets posted suddenly we&#x27;re all Siddhartha under the Bodhi tree. We&#x27;re not. If anything, the personality types here are very, very far from any sort of selfless ideal. Patting ourselves on the back because our six-figure salaries let us rise above the struggle doesn&#x27;t mean the struggle doesn&#x27;t exist and that struggle means acting in a rational, usually unkind way. High class pseudo-spirituality is such a hilariously hypocritical thing its a running gag on HBO&#x27;s Silicon Valley, yet here we are Gavin Belson&#x27;ing it up. At least I&#x27;m honest with myself to say that, no, I&#x27;m not &quot;kind&quot; by these standards and that I will argue and fight with you when I feel its appropriate and more importantly -- I will not feel bad about it afterwards.<p>Sadly, most of the replies to my comment are fairly unkind responses telling me how much of a horrible person I am, especially to retail staff even though I gave no concrete examples of how I act.  How ironic. If anyone is truly interested, I meditate daily and follow Buddhist ideals. I just refuse to go to the yogi-like extremes of insincere self-love in an attempt to con my way out of the struggle of Samsara.  Accepting the reality of who I am is real mindfulness and liberating, and that person is not this uber-kind enlightened being who is &#x27;above it all&#x27; and I doubt anyone here reading this is either. If anything, if we&#x27;re buying into cheap manufactured sentiment that just happens to be self-complimentary, I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re fairly far from that ideal. The same way we point at the nasty evangelicals will hearts full of hate who pat each other on the back for being so pious. Lets not go that route, as tempting as it is. All the technology is showing you this message was made by sweatshop-style labor.  We&#x27;re just not kind.",1431466255

9535004,comment,9534880,9534880,0,0,mindcrime,,,"This strikes me as false dichotomy.  &quot;Startups&quot; and &quot;enterprise software&quot; aren&#x27;t two different things.  There are, for example, startups who are vendors <i>of</i> &quot;enterprise software&quot;.<p>That said, to the extent that I kinda get what you&#x27;re asking, I&#x27;d say that software typically classified as &quot;enterprise&quot; tends to excel at certain things:<p>1. Stability.  Now this ideal isn&#x27;t held up as much as it used to be, but for the most part, high quality enterprise systems are designed to never go down, or if they do go down, they have failover mechanisms or some other means of making sure that transactions don&#x27;t get lost, etc.  There&#x27;s definitely a dichotomy here in terms of pushing for the opposite of &quot;move fast and break stuff&quot; in that &quot;breaking stuff&quot; is not supposed to happen and people are willing to sacrifice some nearness to the bleeding edge, in order to not break systems that the business depends on.<p>2. Integration. Many &quot;enterprise&quot; systems live in complex environments that have accreted all sorts of cruft and complexity over the decades, possibly as a result of mergers and acquisitions, regime change, etc.  As a result an &quot;enterprise&quot; system often has to be able to &quot;talk to&quot; a HUGE array of disparate systems with many protocols, formats and interfaces.<p>3. Flexibility.  Rule #1 is &quot;business requirements change&quot;.  And when the requirements change, the software has to change.  This is why &quot;enterprise&quot; systems have things like the oft-derided &quot;incredibly dense XML configuration files that allow the system to be reconfigured to do something completely different&quot; or have embedded programming languages built right into the system, or have radically denormalized database schemas, etc.  It&#x27;s all about making it possibly to mold the system to fit the new requirements without having to rewrite it from scratch.<p>Of course, as you can imagine, when you combine those factors, you can get some pretty complex, impenetrable and obtuse stuff as a result.  This is largely why &quot;enterprise sofware&quot; gets a bad name.  But really, it&#x27;s all about trying to write software to deal with the messy complexity of the real world.<p>Anyway, what can a startup learn from that?  Well, I think all three of the factors mentioned above are actually important for <i>any</i> software company / service.  It&#x27;s just a question of how much you weight each one.  In theory, if you&#x27;re building a &quot;cat sharing photo social network site&quot;, then maybe you don&#x27;t need the same degree of stability as if you&#x27;re building the order processing system for Amazon.com.  But if your site is down too often, your users will gravitate to some other site.  You can probably work out how the other factors have to be analyzed in similar fashion.",1431465856

It&#x27;s completely under the control of Adobe.</i><p>Perhaps, but I&#x27;m not sure how any of this is different to the various media extension proposals/standards we&#x27;re starting to see more recently.<p>And at least before, if you wanted to serve video from your web site, all you had to do was get one of the numerous Flash video players and prepare one version of your videos that would work in that player on almost any device.<p><i>As Apple explained countless times, it is not because of &quot;arrogance&quot; that they did not support Flash.</i><p>Please forgive me if I don&#x27;t take their word for it. The thing is, Flash has run -- and reasonably well -- on numerous other mobile devices, even some from quite a few years ago, so I don&#x27;t really buy the performance arguments. Even if they had been true for early generations of smartphones and tablets, the performance of these types of device was always expected to increase significantly over time, as indeed it has.<p>If the performance would still be a problem on today&#x27;s iOS devices then presumably Apple&#x27;s users would opt for other implementations instead, but as far as I&#x27;m aware, Apple still have an effective monopoly on distribution of software that runs on iOS devices, and they can and do block anything they don&#x27;t like for sometimes not entirely clear (or, some might argue, entirely fair) reasons. So no-one was ever allowed to decide whether Flash running on a modern iPhone or iPad would have been OK, because that option was removed from the table, and we were left with devices that have bugs and/or non-standard behaviours in basic functionality.<p><i>Flash was also a massive security and stability headache: as Apple loved to point out, it was the single largest source of application crashes on OS X.</i><p>Leaving aside the disturbing implications of Apple actually having a reliable data set on which to base such a claim, <i>browsers</i> are a constant security and stability headache. Take a look at the release notes for Chrome or Firefox, and see how often that little update every few weeks includes at least one critical security update, and how often they have glitches so bad they have to push an out-of-band update instead of waiting just a few weeks. As I said before, there seems little reason to expect better results just because someone shifts things like video rendering and DRM technologies to a slightly different bit of low-level, native, closed source, patent-encumbered, even-the-browser-devs-don&#x27;t-see-it code written in an error-prone language by the same kinds of development team that wrote the plug-ins.",1431465607

You&#x27;d like for someone else, a la the manufacturer, to provide a guarantee that you can be lazy and not take precautions so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about a $1300 radio controlled vehicle that flies doesn&#x27;t hurt someone else?<p>I only mention the general cost because - there&#x27;s not that much margin in these things to achieve what you want.  Nobody will spend $2300 on a Phantom if that additional $1000 is for upgrades to safety and ignorance factors.<p>There are many things that didn&#x27;t start out with any guarantees of implied safety - and many things that are assumed safe, when not operated safely, are inherently very risky / unsafe.<p>Finally, there are easily many tens of thousands of hobby grade drones out there - flying daily, operating (for the most part) safely (again partially dependent on operator).  How many deaths have occurred to date?<p>Something that really bothers me is that when I first started flying the general reaction I had was of excitement - although I was generally no less cautious.  The RC craft I flew drew interest and excitement from bystanders and it was generally a good experience.  Now, I am overly cautious when flying anywhere near public areas.  I&#x27;ve received comments about how I should &quot;go somewhere else&quot;, even when I was flying in an area where there were no people, but someone decided to seek me out since they saw the craft from remote.  And I&#x27;ve generally just tried to stay out of places I know would be potential hazards if there was a malfunction where I lost control.<p>Do I still fly in &quot;tight&quot; locations?  Yes - I do.  I&#x27;ve flown my neighborhood to assess storm damage for my neighbors knowing that there are people - but in those situations I always fly with prop guards and try to fly over houses, not over sidewalks or roads.  And then there&#x27;s the artistic side - I like taking shots of architecture and some of those situations require thoughtful planning or waiting for an area to clear.<p>I can&#x27;t help other people&#x27;s ignorance and I will say that you flying untethered with no experience is not something DJI or I should have to worry about - that&#x27;s your choice and risk to weigh.  If I was your neighbor I&#x27;d have a frank conversation with you about your actual skills and ability to ascertain risk.<p>In my opinion golf is far more risky than flying &quot;drones&quot; (I prefer RC quad-copter, but to each their own).

9534852,comment,9533678,9534506,0,0,fgsfdsfgsfds,,,"A fundamental difference between Japanese and Western animation is their approach to motion. Western animation emphasized fluid motion, attempting to stick to the maximum framerate (24 FPS) allowed by the film medium as much as possible. This could produce striking results, but tended to limit artists to more simpler, slower, more deliberate stretch and squash movements that would make sense when interpolated across key frames. It was also very expensive to produce, which is part of why western studios have mostly abandoned traditional animation, and why the ones that still do 2D often use Flash to cheaply &quot;tween&quot; between keyframes to get fluid motion for the minimum amount of effort.<p>Japanese animation, on the other hand, plays fast and loose with the rules. Very little is animated at the full 24 FPS, drifting around 12 to 8 to 6 FPS (called animating on twos, threes, or fours) for typical scenes. This allows for the user&#x27;s attention to be captured by backgrounds and stills in expository scenes, and encourages a different style of exaggerated movement that emphasizes the &#x27;&#x27;feeling&#x27;&#x27; of the movement over brute force motion quality. It also allows the budget to be conserved for the most important scenes, sakuga (&quot;moments in a show or movie when the quality of the animation improves drastically, typically for the sake of making a dramatic point or enlivening the action.&quot;) So called &quot;key animators&quot; work exclusively on these parts of an animation, and here, their skills in creating expressive motions shine when given the time and resources to completely bring a dramatic scene to life.<p>As the game, comic, and animation artforms grew alongside one another, early games took direct influence from styles of animation native to their creators. The concept of sakuga fit Japanese games well, which would often sparingly animate unimportant &quot;cannon fodder&quot; enemies for the sake of saving budget and development time for elaborate boss monsters. In contrast, I was always struck by the fluidity of motion in Western games produced by groups like The Bitmap Brothers for the platforms like the Amiga, yet unimpressed by the gameplay underneath. It seemed almost as if these groups would spend so much time lavishly animating their characters, that they would forget they were making a game.<p>Another important consideration is that more frames can work against an action game. Every frame of a sword swing, for instance, is another 16th of a second delay between the player&#x27;s button press and the intended action occurring. A 1 or 2 frame anime-style sword swish fits perfectly into this mold, allowing for responsive control and an expression of energy. Whereas many Western games I played would lavishly animate the beginning of a jump, or thrust or swing of a sword, compromising the feel of responsiveness for the sake of the artist&#x27;s ego.<p>So if you notice the lack of frames in a modern &quot;pixel art&quot; game, then while the artists might have been lazy (the typical &quot;pixelated platformer&quot; drawn at a lower resolution than an Atari, with more colors than a SNES game), perhaps they instead were copying older Japanese artists without understanding the <i>reasoning</i> behind their animation choices. Or perhaps you just don&#x27;t appreciate this style of animation.",1431464644

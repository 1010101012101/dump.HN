2544316,comment,2544071,2544151,4,0,dspillett,,,"The Chromebook only has a 16Gb drive, so it'll be something similar to the little SSDs found in a number of netbooks two years ago. These suffer from very poor write performance (and not great bulk read performance) but are perfectly adequate for the sort of IO load a Chromebook will impart.<p>Maybe they are using better models (things will have moved on in the last two years) but they'll probably still be cheaper than a spinning-disk drive. Comparing a 160Gb spinning-disk to a high-spec 128Gb SSD would show a considerably price difference against the SSD, but these are smaller, slower, units. Two years ago the 8Gb SSD Acer netbook I bought was cheaper than the platter based drives (1200Gb IIRC), I expect the same to be the case here.",1305287908
2544315,comment,2544110,2544110,4,0,nagrom,,,"I am someone doing post-doctoral research, looking for an academic position and working in a university environment. I've seen students come in to the university at undergraduate level, students come into the post-graduate program and leave with PhDs. I've also worked in high schools, helping educate kids about physics, and taken students from high schools into the university for 'work-experience' placements.<p>It strikes me that Nature's second idea is what is actually happening right now; people are getting PhDs and leaving to do anything else (mostly banking and medical physics in my field). It's part of an overall trend: our undergraduate syllabus needs to cover a lot of the stuff I was taught in high school 15 years ago. Our post-graduates come into our research group with an expectation of spoon-feeding. Our PhD students have the kind of 'awakening' experiences that were maybe associated with a good undergraduate program back in the 60s and 70s. As more people come into education, the experience (but not necessarily the knowledge) is watered down and so a post-graduate degree is necessary to turn out the kind of well-rounded, hard-working, self-starting individual that might have been found exiting an undergraduate program 40 years ago.<p>Thus a post-doctoral research position becomes essential if one wants to find an academic position - very, very few people get a permanent position without doing at least one post-doc.<p>This may be a good trade-off for the greater numbers with a better education, but it seems that society's expectations are still to catch up.",1305287894

2544313,comment,2543977,2543977,55,0,telemachos,,,">> <i>If it seems hard or even impossible to defend the American way on the merits, that's probably because it emerged from aesthetic, not logical, considerations. According to Rosemary Feal, executive director of the MLA, it was instituted in the early days of the Republic in order ""to improve the appearance of the text. A comma or period that follows a closing quotation mark appears to hang off by itself and creates a gap in the line (since the space over the mark combines with the following word space)."" I don't doubt Feal, but the appearance argument doesn't carry much heft today; more to the point is that we are simply accustomed to the style.</i><p>This is the real story here I think: people invented the rule to suit their preferences, but over time we've forgotten the rule's origin and now treat it like a holy truth. (Or worse yet a matter of ""grammar""! Run, run - you've made a grammatical mistake!)  You are likely to discover this over and over again if you study the background of many rules that (some) writing teachers insist on and that people like Lynn Truss use as an excuse to foam at the mouth.<p>Here are some of my least-favorite myths, in no particular order:<p>+ You should never end a sentence with a preposition. (Sheer bullshit: English uses countless phrasal verbs ('throw away') and in many other cases avoiding the final preposition produces stuffy nonsense.)<p>+ You should never split an infinitive. (A completely made-up rule, based on mistakenly trying to apply Latin rules to a Germanic language.)<p>+ The word 'hopefully' can only mean 'in a hopeful spirit' and therefore you shouldn't say, ""Hopefully, we'll arive before lunch tomorrow."" (Sheer bullshit again: 'hopefully' there functions as an adverb modifying the entire clause 'we'll arrive before lunch tomorrow'. The sentence as a whole clearly and obviously means ""It is to be hoped that..."" or less formally ""We hope that..."" This use of 'hopefully' is no different than 'fortunately', 'sadly', 'happily' or 'luckily' in countless sentences.)<p>+ Don't start sentences with 'but' or 'and' or 'however'. (Just goofy.)<p>+ Never use the passive voice. (Overdoing it at the least: Yes, a lot of beauraucratic and other bad writing uses the passive in excess, but the passive is not <i>per se</i> evil or always wrong.)",1305287876
2544312,comment,2544041,2544041,2,0,latch,,,"There are two main reasons to choose NoSQL.<p>The first, aimed at every developer/application out there, is that some NoSQL solutions (document stores being the most obvious to me) have less friction with OO languages. In other words, they are simply more productive to work with. Embedded types, arrays as first class objects, and schemaless design all help you write simpler infrastructure code that takes less time to write, test and maintain.<p>The second reason is that some NoSQL solutions provide specialized features/capabilities. For example, what you can do with an [Ordered] Set in Redis simple isn't possible with relational databases of moderate (say 100K rows) size. You either have to lower your requirements (not real time), or increase your hardware. There are various examples...Solr does better indexing, Hadoop does better data processing....MongoDB does good logging and geospatial stuff.<p>The right way to look at it, imo, is to see RDBMS as specialized systems. Most people should almost always opt for a more productive general purpose solution upfront (say MongoDB), and then only turn on a specialized supplementary system (say Hadoop, or PostgreSQL) when they have those specialized needs.<p>Choose SQL for the right reasons.",1305287812

The Church has virtually no consensus outside the Nicene Creed (and even then that's simply a definition of the Church others will argue for a more liberal or more conservative definition). Christianity is, at the centre, about personal action.<p>I see what you're getting at, I think. The person of Jesus Christ is like an anchorage point for peoples lives that gives them a certain locus. Computers, though I think we're probably talking about the Web really, do something similar - the Web is like a secret society for everyone who can access it.<p>>Those without the ambition will, as always follow the crowd.<p>Which crowd? Like the Church there are focuses of people, lots of them. Unlike IRL one can choose to be allied to almost any group one wishes without geographical restrictions. Online one makes a positive affirmation as to which group one wishes to be allied to. You don't have to, for example, keep visiting a site and taking part in their memes and affirming their groupthink you choose to.<p>IMO you need more than just ambition, you also need opportunity. To some extent you may be able to make opportunities and this is probably vastly easier if you're wealthy, already well connected, etc., just as in the past.",1305287177

My career was just getting started so it was my pleasure to volunteer my time -- 8 to 10 hours a day. I was responsible for the Napster Ground Zero effort, which I started and managed. I was an administrator there -- not just only a chat moderator volunteer on the Napster service (although I did have the chat moderator access level as well). The Napster Ground Zero service was insanely popular and allowed napster users to have a persistent identity online, beyond just the chat service. I received a written recommendation from a Napster cofounder and created some great relationships, which was great at that early time in my career. I appreciate every moment of that experience. On a side note, it was great to connect with them again in person at the Napster 10-year reunion last year (can you believe it's already been over 10 years now?). Shawn Fanning throws amazing parties.<p>As for AllAdvantage, I was a security consultant there. This was a paid position. I was involved directly with the company (and have maintained contact with some of the people there over the years, including the CEO). The software I created, first of its kind called MyAdvantage, got their attention. I was asked to be a security consultant for them to hunt down other software and to help protect their Viewbar software. I agreed and helped with the onslaught of the waves of similar software to my original. Sadly, their business model was fundamentally flawed, but that's an entirely different story.<p>Great times back then. Heady days of the last dot-com boom.",1305285349

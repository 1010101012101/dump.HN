They prefer clicks over impressions, which leads to a lose-lose.<p>They could improve the situation by doing the opposite of what they do at the moment.<p>And Apple with its iAds is not much better, they would profit if more websites would cease to provide a mobile version and provide an iAs funded iOS app in their walled garden app store.",1434027593

9699377,comment,9697036,9698849,0,0,300bps,,,"Essentially, a lot of investors bought bonds at tremendously low interest rates because they believed an extended period of deflation could happen.  What appears to be happening instead is inflation of the money supply.<p>If you buy a bond that yields 1.00% and inflation is negative 1.00% (i.e. deflation) then your real yield is positive 2.00%.  On the other hand if inflation is positive 1.00% then your real yield is 0.00%.<p>As data is coming out is showing that inflation is occurring and not deflation, investors are selling their low yield bonds.  This lowers the market price of the bonds and since a bond&#x27;s yield moves inversely to its market price, it raises the yield.<p>EDIT:  mild inflation is really what you want with our monetary system, not deflation.  So this is not a bad thing for the economy per se but some investors that bought low yield bonds will lose money or opportunity as interest rates rise.",1434027582

better than that in time - an improved version with linear space complexity was
presented by Hirschberg in 75 - but that doesn&#x27;t mean execution times can&#x27;t be
improved. Today there are various variations of the same family of algorithms
with ever improving execution times. Some adapt the algorithm to massively
parallel setups with hundreds of GPUs, others use speculative execution, some
use approximations, and so forth.",1434026796

There are more gigs, more songs available than ever before, bands are being treated with more respect, and are more in control of their careers and destinies.<p>“I see them continuing as a constellation of enterprises: some big, some small, most small but all of them with a more immediate response from their audience and a greater chance to succeed.

Part of the strength comes from the excellent tooling the Go community created. Each tool is orthogonal to each other and they are pluggable and reusable. So vim-go for example uses these tools to create wrappers around it and blend it like it&#x27;s a part of Vim itself. It&#x27;s not a IDE of course, however it feels like that.<p>I think the most important thing here is providing a orthogonal tools and well defined boundaries between them (which the Go tools have achieved already). Once that is established, more greater and better tools can be created upon on it.<p>I look for other language plugins from time to time and each time I see the same thing. The language which the plugin is build on itself doesn&#x27;t have the sense of &quot;orthogonality&quot;. So it makes it difficult to create plugin and support it. Once the underlying language and the community get the sense for it, the tool(in our case the Vim plugin and ecosystem) will improve itself too.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/fatih/vim-go"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fatih/vim-go</a>",1434026649

Github charges you for private repositories while bitbucket offers them for free. But with bitbucket you are limited to only 5 collaborators - so it&#x27;s not really useful for anything but personal repo hosting. I teach classes on occasion (obviously more than 5 students) and I pre-provision repos on my own source code hosting service but I also allow the students to get a free private repo from github (they are free if you say you are using it for a class).<p>> And that even if its not, we should host a copy of repos on bitbucket too, because competition is good?<p>It&#x27;s very unlikely and rare that github would go down or be shutdown but due to google code shutting down I&#x27;ve learned that - it&#x27;s not a good idea to keep your project (code) in a central location. You can mirror it - but if you aren&#x27;t running the service yourself be ready to jump ship to either shutdown or changing of features. Github did remove downloads at one point but reintroduced them as releases.<p>More and more employers are (incorrectly) using github as a CV for developers. So I think github will be the primary source code hosting service for awhile until people realize that a user&#x27;s github profile is not a proper CV.",1434025235

Letting it sit around in cash is not a wise idea because oftentimes, rising interest rates come hand in hand with inflation. Your best bet is to buy something of &quot;real&quot; value, be it gold, real estate, or stocks. In my opinion, this could explain the growing divergence between stocks and bonds.

9699111,comment,9697058,9698051,0,0,Sideloader,,,"You talk about our ancestors and their descendents fighting to create democracies out of feudalism and I broadly agree with that notion (assuming you mean during the historical period beginning with the American and French revolutions and ending after the Second World War).<p>Looking at the western world today it seems obvious that the rights and liberties our ancestors fought to achieve and uphold are not something we should be taking for granted. Indeed, in 2015 there is compelling evidence that liberal democracy and its star progeny - a stable and prosperous middle-class - are seriously wounded. You even list some of the factors contributing to the current state of affairs in other posts in this thread.<p>However if I came across as fatalistic that certainly wasn&#x27;t my intention. Yes, democracy is wounded and under attack but that does not mean a return to feudalism is inevitable. I did say that a return to some sort of feudal order seems likely <i>if</i> current trends continue unopposed. Even pacified westerners have a breaking point. The growing movement to keep the free and open internet from being subjugated by governments and corporations in the name of a global surveillance society shows that people are not going to sit idly by and let the powers that be strip away their hard won rights and liberties. Ditto the ongoing campaign for a liveable wage and police accountability.<p>That said it would be a fatal mistake to underestimate the addictive nature of power  and the effect it has on those who possess it. The &quot;global elite&quot; will not wake up one morning and decide to share the spoils of legislated inequality.<p>As political scientist Henry Farrell, referencing British academic Colin Crouch&#x27;s 2009 book <i>Post-Democracy</i>, wrote: <i>&quot;At some point shortly after the end of the Second World War, democracy reached its apex in countries such as Britain and the US. According to Crouch, it has been declining ever since. Places such as Italy had more ambiguous histories of rise and decline, while others still, including Spain, Portugal and Greece, began the ascent much later, having only emerged from dictatorship in the 1970s. Nevertheless, all of these countries have reached the downward slope of the arc. The formal structures of democracy remain intact. People still vote. Political parties vie with each other in elections, and circulate in and out of government. Yet these acts of apparent choice have had their meaning hollowed out. The real decisions are taken elsewhere. We have become squatters in the ruins of the great democratic societies of the past.&quot;</i> (<a href=""http://aeon.co/magazine/society/henry-farrell-post-democracy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aeon.co/magazine/society/henry-farrell-post-democracy...</a>)<p>It remains to be seen whether democracy will persevere or if this brief (so far) respite from feudalism will remain an historical anomaly. The choices we make going forward will have a huge impact here. If we decide to keep our heads buried in the sand and continue telling ourselves that everything is just fine despite evidence to the contrary, <i>that</i> would be immensely disrespectful to every person that has risked life and well-being to create or protect the rights and liberties we too easily take for granted...even as they are being systematically dismantled all around us.",1434024552

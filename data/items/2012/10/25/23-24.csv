A single cheat client can cause great havoc within a game instance. Even if the individual device can be banned, another actor can take it's place. Legitimate clients will get frustrated quickly on a prolonged attack. And <i>that</i> is where the real damage is.",1351209581

I am building my current company in Austin because I see here what the Valley was in 2002-2004. Growing fast, retooling itself as a startup hub, and building real businesses with real revenue.<p>Developers are (somewhat) easier to hire here. Salaries and cost of living are lower. No state income tax saves you some good money, too (matters more once you get acquired and/or start pulling down a larger salary.)<p>Weather is less great, but you do have seasons here, which I can appreciate, having lived in California most of my adult life.<p>Funding is available, though not quite as easy to get as in the Bay Area. However, I will say, once you figure out who the investors are in Austin, they <i>love</i> to invest in local companies with traction and revenue. And there are venture funds here, as well. In addition to local funds, 500 Startups makes several trips through Austin a year and funds the most promising startups here.<p>Plus, Austin is a fun city that has a lot of fresh, young energy. Thriving culture, bike- and scooter-friendly, and did I mention you can actually afford to buy a house here? I suppose that's more important for us ""old fogies"" who are already in our 30's. ;) Oh, yeah, and you can drink beer at the movies thanks to Alamo Drafthouse. Also, if you're a foodie, Austin is epic.

A year after YC, they were still figuring out their idea. They lived with the Wepay guys and one day the Wepays had a party for their investors. By that point the Lockitrons were working on a product to lock your door with an iPhone. They were able to impress one of the investors with their prototype, and he asked to have 40 installed in some startup offices he owned. The founders were psyched, but the commercial locks they needed to use cost $500 a pop. They didn't have $20,000 to fulfill an order that big. So they went around to the local locksmiths and scrapyards, buying broken locks for about $10 each. They fixed them themselves and were able to deliver on that order.</i>",1351207772

Anyway, we certainly did use it to manage daemon processes, although not deliberately; we had a daemon that communicated with external software about system events, and running shell scripts was part of that.  We didn't necessarily anticipate folks running 'service httpd start' in those shell scripts, but it was not an inherently unreasonable thing to do.<p>And this isn't ""arbitrary use cases""; this is an explicitly supported function that is completely contrary to good practice and sane behavior and, to boot, has the ability to arbitrarily kill programs for impenetrable reasons and block for significant periods of time (<i>the</i> central sin of event driver programming).  You can't tell me that if you saw something like this in a random crypto library you wouldn't immediately tell everybody to stop using it; why should EM's developers get a pass for their, yes, <i>incompetently written</i> popen?

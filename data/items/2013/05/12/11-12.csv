5693925,comment,5693365,5693778,8,0,slacka,,,"> In the time since that comment was written (just under 5 years), Linux replaced most graphics drivers with ones based on in-kernel modesetting and the DRI2 interface. This was done without breaking applications. So, the assertion that changing the video driver model would be disruptive is kind of disproven by reality.<p>mjg59, I could not disagree more. Without working drivers what good are working apps? I can run my Radeon x1900 under Windows 7/8 with Windows Vista drivers. Runs StarCraft2 and newer FPS games just fine.<p>The Linux kernel devs are so determined to break binary compatibility, I haven't been able to run with ATI's proprietary binary drivers for years. While AMD was a good open source citizen and released the specs, the open source drivers for my card are useless for anything other than 2D. That's about as disruptive as it gets.",1368359093

At the same time it has to be engaging and still look solvable i.e. the player must always have the feeling that ""next time I'll do it!"" or he will just stop playing.<p>One of the last bosses in Zelda is an interesting example. It starts as a dragon with three heads. One which is only killable by fire, the other by ice, the last one is invincible but tries to bite you. When the outer heads are dead the third head transforms to a fast moving snake which you have to hit at a specific point to damage. Each time you hit it it gets faster. Now, if you die something interesting happens: The next snake will start slower i.e. easier, so players should be able to kill more parts of it. This repeats itself every time you die. I noticed this when my mother (who loves Nintendo games, but isn't a really good player) died 20 times or so at the snake. Every time it was a bit slower and every time she was like ""Well I did manage to kill one more part. THIS time I kill it!"" and ran in again.

5693870,comment,5690812,5692819,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"Not grandparent, but let me try.<p>ML (Ocaml, I should say, because that's my experience) is like a functional C. As a production language, I'd recommend it highly. It has excellent garbage collection. It generates blazingly fast native code.<p>I can't speak either way about Haskell's use in production. I'm sure that many people have made it work. I just don't know how hard it is in practice.<p>Haskell is lazy, for one, which makes it hard to reason about performance. You can have production memory leaks that are a bitch to debug. It also has a much more powerful, but also more complex type system. Explicit functors (Ocaml) are replaced by implicit type classes, which make the language more attractive (I'll grant that) but also make it easier to hang yourself by the monads.<p>Haskell's still a great language, and there are a million things that recommend it. However, I don't see it as occupying the same space as the ML family. The main similarity is that both use Hindley-Milner type inference, but there are a lot of differences, too.<p>Finally, Haskell is pure (except in the IO Monad, and a couple others) while Ocaml's not. You have stateful arrays and ref cells in Ocaml, and use them all the time when you're writing high-performance production code. In Haskell, any IO is to be done ""in the IO monad"" (which means, ""in the context of evaluating an IO a"", the latter being a thunk that does IO and returns an a.)",1368357037

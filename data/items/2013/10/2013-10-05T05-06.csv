6499605,comment,6499431,6499523,3,0,pandaman,,,"People are not used to roundabouts in America. I lived in place where a whole residential area (i.e. very light traffic, low speed limit, school zones) used roundabouts instead of stop signs. Almost every other time I&#x27;ve seen another car on a roundabout it&#x27;s been making a left turn by driving clockwise (in America people normally drive on the right side of the road so you need to drive counterclockwise). On a more lively roundabout that was on my way to a freeway I had to be very careful as a significant number of merging cars believed they have a right of way. If there had been a way from my home that did not have a roundabout I&#x27;d rather use that because roundabouts were really scary.",1380952773

They were part of my driving test to get my license as a teenager.<p>My take on them is that they probably do make traffic flow faster, but I was always a bit scared to enter them whilst driving as almost no one seemed to understand the rules. i.e. If you&#x27;re taking the first exit of the rotary, you should be in the right hand lane, if your not, you should be in the left hand lane. As a result there was a lot of awkward lane changing by people whilst at high turn angles, which was messy, mostly folks in the right hand lane of the rotary going multiple exits and ultimately cutting off someone in the left hand rotary lane on the way to a single lane exit.",1380952487

Most people seem to get <i>some</i> enjoyment from what they do for work, or at least can find satisfaction in it at the end of the day. With a basic income, a person can worry less about making ends meet and more about doing what they want to do. In the short term, that might mean slacking off (and inflation)but in the long term it seems like people would start being generally productive again, and much happier for it. A sizable chunk of people will just keep doing what theyre doing.<p>There is little worse than creating jobsI equate that with creating inefficiency. (Creating <i>careers</i> is another story.) But the more things we can automate, the more humans can live leisurely, thoughtful, happy lives.

Of course, I&#x27;m young and single but by no means frugal. (I find that the little costs involved in worrying about my expenses easily outweigh the money saved.) So this is quite an income.<p>One of the main questions about something like this is about who would do boring, low-paid work with this sort of basic income. What I would really hope is that people would still do many of those jobs, but for far fewer hours--largely as a way to get money for incidental expenses and luxuries beyond the basic income. One problem I find with most jobs is that it&#x27;s much easier to get more pay than less hours, even if I really want the latter. There is a large drop-off between full-time and part-time work.[1]<p>Beyond a certain level, I would value having more free time far more than making more money. Unfortunately, mostly for social reasons, it&#x27;s hard to express this preference. A basic income could make this much easier to do.<p>While I suspect this might not pass, I think it would be very valuable for the entire world. One of the unfortunate realities in politics is that it is really hard to run experiments; small countries like Switzerland can act as a test subject for the entire world. Or perhaps like a tech early adopter for modern policies.<p>Either way, this passing would be very interesting.<p>[1]: For me, this is not quite as simple.

6499532,comment,6497478,6498351,2,0,nshepperd,,,"Assume a Tesla vehicle has a constant risk of catching fire per mile. That is, we have a exponential distribution `P(catch fire after t miles | hazard rate) = P(t|a) = a exp(-at)` where `a` is the hazard rate (average fires per mile). Furthermore we&#x27;ll assume an exponential prior on `a`: `P(a) = w exp(-wa)`. `w` is a parameter that expresses how much prior knowledge we have of `a`. In the limit `w=0` we know nothing at all, except that it&#x27;s nonnegative.<p>Our data is the fact that we went 100 million miles before a fire, after which exactly one fire happened, so we want to find the distribution `P(a|t = 100 million)` which tell us everything we want to know about `a`.<p>Then use Bayes&#x27; theorem: `P(a|t) = P(t|a) P(a) / P(t) = aw exp(-a(t+w)) / P(t)`. The normalization factor `P(t)` involves an integral over `P(t|a) P(a) da` from 0 to , which wolfram alpha tells me evaluates as w / (t+w)^2.<p>So our posterior probability is `P(a|t) = a (w+t)^2 exp(-a(t+w))`, but we can take the limit `w -> 0` at this point for a fully uninformative prior: `P(a|t) = a t^2 exp(-at)`.<p>So we can just set `t=100e6 miles`, and now calculate things like the expectation of the distribution: `E[a] = 2/t = 2e-8 per mile`. Or the probability that the hazard rate is less than other cars, which is the integral from 0 to 1/(20 million miles): `P(a < b) = 1 - exp(-bt) (bt + 1) = 0.96`.",1380951011

As it is sometimes typical on HN, the poster with a message outside the &quot;go team&quot; cargo-cult mentality wasn&#x27;t very welcome.  I happen to think he had a very interesting point.  And that point translates well into this thread.<p>Why don&#x27;t we see practical applications of all of these robotics experiments?  The answer is very simple really:  Most of them are relatively pointless and add very little to the robotics knowledge-base that will be needed to really move robotics forward into real-world applied robots.<p>Think of something like robotics vacuum cleaners.  Nothing whatsoever innovative about any of them.  It&#x27;s a wheeled platform that has been in use in hobby and research robotics since, well, forever.  The &#x27;70&#x27;s and &#x27;80&#x27;s were full of robots with this basic platform.  What changed?  Electronics got better, batteries smaller, microprocessors more capable, manufacturing more efficient.  What was retained and reused from prior research?  Probably not much.<p>I started in college with the goal of becoming a robotics engineer.  An EE with specialization in robotics.  It didn&#x27;t take long for me to realize that the field wasn&#x27;t as interesting and exciting as I made it out to be in my mind.  The R2D2&#x27;s and C3-PO&#x27;s were nowhere to be found and were easily decades away from becoming reality.  If I wanted to be in robotics I would end-up making industrial manipulators or things with motors that we would all pretend were robots.  That&#x27;s a pet peeve of mine.  Battlebots had nothing whatsoever to do with robotics.  It was about a bunch of remote controlled machines.  Not robots.<p>I digress.  The point is that I was really excited about the field until I realized what I wanted to do would have to wait 50 or 100 years.  I wanted to work on Commander Data, not a mindless pick-and-place machine.<p>And so I begun to dissect things and think about what it would take to get there.  Do we learn anything by making humanoid-looking little robots out of RC servos?  I built a couple.  It&#x27;s an utter waste of time.  Nothing whatsoever of value other than to pretend we built a humanoid.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a great hobby and lots of fun for the kids to learn, but it is far, far away from anything even remotely useful.<p>In my opinion these are the areas that need a quantum leap in development before robots like Wildcat can become useful and relevant outside the lab:<p>ARTIFICIAL MUSCLES<p>This is huge.  Motors, gears, springs, pistons and bladders just don&#x27;t cut it.  We need a step change in the performance and capabilities of what we use to do the job of biological muscles.  Machines like Wildcat can&#x27;t operate for days at a time.  They use internal combustion engines to power pumps and hydraulic or pneumatic end-effectors to actuate joints.  This is lousy.  Very little can be learned from trying to operate such machines.  You end-up with things like Asimo that walk like they are taking a dump because it is nearly impossible to implement true dynamic gaits because we either can&#x27;t implement enough degrees of freedom or joint actuation simply isn&#x27;t up to par.<p>Artificial muscles that perform well and are energy efficient would revolutionize the field.<p>ENERGY STORAGE<p>Thankfully this is something robotics shares with electric cars.  We need to do much better than current LiPo cells allow in terms of volumetric power density (at the very least).<p>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE + CONTROL SYSTEMS<p>This is a field that has seen advances but is nowhere near where it needs to be.  I can teach a five year old kid how to sort and fold a pile of clothes without much effort (other than maintaining his or her attention).  It would be very hard to do the same with the AI we have mastered to date.  I am talking about having a couple of robot arms and a camera presented with a random pile of clothes and having those clothes sorted and properly folded as a human would.  No special mechanics, suction mechanisms or anything like that.<p>PROCESSING / NEURAL COMPUTING<p>The AI+CONTROL field ultimately needs far more advanced and energy efficient processing architectures than are commonly available today.  Stuffing a robot with a powerful Linux PC provides nowhere near the processing bandwidth needed to perform at a level comparable to a human child.  I am not sure what form this step improvement in computing will take, but we need it.<p>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES / DEVELOPMENT AND SIMULATION TOOLS<p>We are in the dark ages.  We need a serious paradigm shift in the way we program computers if we are ever going to even approach something that can compare to the fictional C3-PO or Commander Data ideas.<p>If you want to contribute to robotics your time and efforts would be far better spent on the above (I am sure there are other areas I have not listed) rather than making little remote-controlled gyro-actuated cubes that link to each other via magnets.  I don&#x27;t know what can be learned from that other than making remote-controlled gyro-actuated little cubes that link together via magnets.  Cool toy.  Useless for the advancement of robotics.  It&#x27;s almost like spending a lot of time playing chess:  You become better at playing chess, a narrow skill, and virtually nothing you do can be translated or reused for other tasks outside of chess.  Grandmasters are not genius thinkers, they are simply great chess players and that&#x27;s it.  Master little cubes with gyros and that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ve mastered.<p>I have two German Shepherd dogs.  I have trained both of them to search for objects I hide anywhere in the house.  I show them the object, I let them smell it and then hide the object while they wait in a &quot;sit-stay&quot; well out of sight.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll hide the object deep in a drawer inside a closet in an upstairs bedroom while they wait in the garage with the door closed.  These dogs are amazing to watch.  They always find what I showed them.  Every so often they need a little help (and they ask for it), most of the time they do it on their own.  Think about all that is required for an animal to do this spanning a range of capabilities from cognition, perception, sensing, navigation, planning, communications and more.<p>There is no way a bunch of little blocks or a gasoline-hydraulic-powered machine is helping us advance towards even something as simple, in terms of biological beings, as finding an hidden object using smell.  A better place to spend money and resources is in the areas I highlighted above and others I did not mention.  Once you &quot;ace&quot; the above, the process of designing and fabricating a mechanical frame with the required capabilities should be an almost academic exercise for any engineer with a moderate range of experience in the electromechanical fields.<p>Not to minimize Boston Dynamic, but I really think a lot of what they and others are doing is simply burning tax money for no good reason.  Well, there is a good reason.  The government folks who shovel out the money are easily impressed by this stuff.  Nothing really advances but it is impressive as hell.  Who knows how much money was burned on the GE walker in the 1960&#x27;s [1].  I don&#x27;t know of anything that came out of that project and is in use today.  If I gave any reasonably capable team of engineers a few million dollars to play --without a requirement to actually deliver something that works in the real world-- they could build similarly capable machines.  There&#x27;s nothing special about these systems other than they are impressive to the untrained eye.<p>General Electric built quadrupeds in 1968 [1]. The only reason they didn&#x27;t perform like the Boston Dynamics rigs is that they did not have access to better computing platforms, sensors and electronics.  There is nothing in the Boston Dynamics machines in terms of mechanics or hydraulics that was not available or could not be implemented in 1968.  Just look at the video [2] (got to love the sound effects).  This machine, all by itself, proves my point about the futility of some of this research.  They all put the cart in front of the horse.  The GE machine needed better effectors, sensors, energy storage, AI and control.  The machine shows the amazing mechanical complexity that was attainable in 1968.  Remember, no Solidworks, no microprocessors, no FPGA&#x27;s, no Linux, just a dude pulling levers.  Amazing stuff.<p>We are simply focusing on and throwing money at the wrong things.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6495440"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6495440</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/Image.Archive/other.robots/Mosher.GE.walking.truck.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/Image.Archive...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMGCFLEYakM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMGCFLEYakM</a><p>EDIT:<p>Just came across this, which is really cool (1957):<p><a href=""http://cyberneticzoo.com/?p=8392"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cyberneticzoo.com/?p=8392</a>",1380950016

The trick here is that all appropriations bills are automatically considered to also be confidence votes.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about Australia, but in Canada it goes one step further: any bill, introduced by the ruling party, that represents their core party agenda, is also automatically a confidence vote. So, for example, if a party wins an election on a platform of banning gay marriage, and the subsequent bill fails to pass, the government is dissolved.<p>This can have some positive effects - it tends to make party platforms more moderate and the legislation itself less extreme. This only works in multi-party systems though, since in a two-party system the majority will simply never lose a confidence vote.",1380949963

It would be neat to see a demo of it at least.<p>Thinking about it, while not implemented for the whole experience, are there any apps that do this?<p>To some extent Safari on OS X does this now (since what version, I&#x27;m not sure). While you can zoom in and around a page, you can also zoom out when the page is at 100% and get a view of all the open tabs. iPad with its multitasking control is similar (swipe up with 4 fingers to see all tasks, tap on one to switch to it). A photo app would, as demonstrated, be an appropriate use, same with the calendar. Instead of having to hit buttons to move up the hierarchy allow the users to pinch-to-zoom instead.",1380949606

Those being furloughed seem to be in the industrial/manufacturing sectors. These are people making the aircraft, ground vehicles or components for them. Future furloughs will hit those whose contracts were to get funding this fiscal year (appropriations can span multiple years, so it&#x27;s possible a contract is funded despite this, but many may not be funded until after this current budget is passed). And companies will likely use this as an excuse to save some money by furloughing more employees than just the ones on affected projects. And in turn I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they try to change the terms of their existing contracts to stretch out deadlines, even contracts that shouldn&#x27;t have been effected. Hooray! More money down the drain.",1380949204

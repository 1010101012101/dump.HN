If the founders have done such a great job raising money in the past (30 million, was it?), why not raise some more money now, and invest 20 grand in each of the young startups that they accept into the program?

One may be nitpicking, but 'where to get the data' is not part of the business logic: it's pure application logic, dependent on your solution of the problem. In that sense, his argument is wrong. The other reason definitely isn't nitpicking: you can solve the problem by adding a layer between your DAO's and the databases, that handles the 'where to get the data' question. So yes, it requires some programming, but it is still transparant to the business logic.

I hope someone with more knowledge vis a vis the US student loan system chimes in, but I'll add where I can.<p>To begin with, in the US, it's important to distinguish federal loans from those issued by the private sector. The former are issued by the government, the latter by private institutions (banks, et al).<p>Federal loans : The IBR (income based repayment) plan was recently introduced [1]. It appears similar to the UK plan, except the implementation details are different (15% of income over 25 years). There are of course eligibility requirements that (shock of shocks) are not always crystal clear [4]<p>Private loans : nothing whatsoever AFAIK, nor much planned future legislation<p>Lastly, it's important to note that <i>both</i> public and private US student loans are <i>notoriously</i> difficult to have discharged, including in the event of bankruptcy. The bar is set high enough to almost be considered de-facto impossible [5] (opinion).<p>This, IMO, makes the astronomically high figure presented here all the more alarming. An affordable education <i>is</i> possible in this country, but we haven't been good at educating the public in this regard (ironically, I guess).<p>For a general breakdown on the differences between federal & private loans, see the linked chart [6]. While I guess I should have known this already, I was surprised to note that some privately issued loans come bundled with pre-payment penalties.<p>[1] <a href=""http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-based"" rel=""nofollow"">http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans/income...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income-Based_Repayment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income-Based_Repayment</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-02-12/business/sns-201302121830--tms--savingsgctnzy-a20130212-20130212_1_student-loans-private-lenders-sallie-mae"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-02-12/business/sns-2...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/your-money/student-loans/explaining-new-federal-student-loan-rules.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/your-money/student-loans/e...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/01/business/shedding-student-loans-in-bankruptcy-is-an-uphill-battle.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/01/business/shedding-student-...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/loans/federal-vs-private"" rel=""nofollow"">http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/loans/federal-vs-private</a>",1362218352

If you think about it, a Google search result is actually many things; it has results from various sources, such as the web, images, videos, news, social signals from G+, etc. All of those are different services that are aggregated to build your result page.<p>Since all of those queries are fired at the same time, the only metric that matters at the end is the wall time, not the CPU time used during the query.<p>I also seriously doubt that the servers that handle the Google front page can only do one query at a time; at the very least, they're multithreaded, but probably concurrent. It probably works as below:<p>1. Parse query\n2. Send query to backend servers\n3. Wait until all backends replied or at most 250ms (or some other timeout)\n4.

If my math is right, that makes for 2,455 applicants.""<p>I'm afraid you're missing the point. The point is that those who want to study art will study art. In addition many don't just study ""art"" in the traditional sense of making paintings. They study some applicability of art whether it's design, architecture, etc. Why? Well the same reason more people become programmers and not computer scientists, or engineers and not theoretical physicists. Theory only appeals to some people<p>""But how much math did they take by the time they make it through high school math? Maybe 9, 10, or even 12 years of math. Which is probably an order of magnitude more than they have years of art""<p>Again, I'm going to have to ask you to be specific with your definition of the ""creative arts"" because it seems your gripe is that we are teaching kids math instead of drawing in school; to which of course the appropriate response is school is for learning, not for doodling. Just like you should have a certain level of reading capacity, you should also have a certain level of reasoning capacity. This is the bare minimum one should have. So if your gripe is about the amount of math taught, well, I hope you take that same gripe with history, literature, geography, and even PE. Furthermore, art classes are offered as electives and are free to be utilized by students who want to take them.<p>""Of those, I'd say Nursing and the more sciencey fields like Biology, Computer science, Psychology, and maybe some Political science need math. The others not so much. Of course, out of these, Computer science is the most math-heavy.\nIncidentally, according to this[5], Stanford's most popular major now is Computer Science""<p>Seriously, what point are you trying to make? It seems more like you're disgruntled that math is relevant to more spheres of life than art - however it is that you are defining that. Furthermore, noting the dearth of CS grads at Stanford is like noting the dearth of engineers at MIT (or blackjack players ;) ). What do you think the school is famous for? In any case, the author of the essay's point has nothing to do with who is studying what because if it were he'd be complaining about social science, humanities, and business majors. His essay is about the demise of creativity - however he defines that. Furthermore, as a relation to my first post, noting that one should learn science before one has an opinion about it, it seems it would be beneficial if you followed that. Just because one reads a ""science"" subject does not mean they will learn math, especially not Biology and Psychology. As a matter of fact, many CS grads get away with only calc 1. And to be clear, until you get past calc 4, you're not really doing ""math"", just numeric manipulation - which itself isn't trivial.<p>To be clear: it's not about how many areas of life find math beneficial. As a matter of fact, that is the point. Despite the overwhelming potential for analytics to transform the world, despite the new knowledge to be gained STEM has not been culturally relevant till now. Now is when it is most painfully obvious that he who understands the world holds the power. It used to be he who holds the purse strings, but thanks to the litany of these technologies that we're talking about, it's becoming less so (though not fast enough). The important questions in the world are/have been/ are being asked, and not many of them involve ""self-expression"". Knowledge of Science and Math add a whole new dimension to our exploration of the world and people are just taking notice. That is the point. The journey that STEM has made from esoterica to becoming a full participant in the cultural discussion. The idea that we can even consider STEM a cultural activity. Smashing that barrier that keeps people assuming that STEM people are these little weird people with their irrelevant subjects and threats to human existence and starting to see it as a part of the human experience like any other. That's what I'm talking about. That's what the author of the essay doesn't get. That's why I keep volunteering to teach kids math and physics on my own dime. So of course, arrogantly determining, from an old world view of the subject, that STEM is a mechanistic chore best left for uncreative robots is not only very annoying but very unproductive. I'm sure you're very passionate about art, and in a perfect world, we would all have the things we love be recognized both culturally and economically. But antagonizing an entire field just because one's field isn't getting the limelight is not a productive way to go.",1362217548

5309057,comment,5308280,5309016,1,0,Sataysfied,,,"Thanks for your suggestions. We did Satays because it was a family recipe and customers loved our food back when I first started out as a solo guy selling on the streets. From there I expanded the menu around this. I do not know much about cooking to be honest and I think what we have, customers currently love. While I realize we could tangent off to other foods, thats not really our business or goal. We want to grow our current business to reach more customers. Those that have tried us have in the past re-ordered (but this was all through the catering agencies). We are now working to go direct.<p>Our goal is not to become another catering agency. Our goal is to grow our business to cater to as many companies that will have us. I think its important to focus at what we're good at and I firmly believe in this model.<p>We have considered selling Satays frozen and ship it but that isn't easy and there is a lot of issues around this. We can't ship cooked food due to lots of regulations and laws. Its an incredibly difficult path as we have considered in the past (before the current pivot) to be the Omaha Steaks of Satays or be in stores like Costco. I have explored both extensively and landed to the conclusion that the business we are doing now was the best for our future.<p>We have had a few press coverage in the past to be honest but I don't know how much that has helped us as a whole. Especially since we have pivoted but I will reach out to them again soon.<p>We did do festivals and events before and it was very hit or miss and the total revenue was actually less than what we were doing now.<p>No race tracks nearby that I can think of. I am definitely going to do a meetup as well as reach out to current meetups soon. Not sure if there are many movie productions that are around here but we are definitely open to any business that would love catering.<p>Our menu is tiny so we don't have an overly complex menu at the moment. We started on the street with just Satays and expanded the menu there before pivoting twice to the current model. Our customers have definitely been satisfied with our food, it really is more about reaching out I believe.<p>I greatly appreciate you taking out the time to offer suggestions and will look at the other stuff mentioned. I am willing to try anything at this point and will think it over for future implementation if we survive long enough. Above all, I appreciate your kind words. Thank you.",1362216926

Don't forget that a lot of I/O is very fast nowadays: if you're reading 100's of MB from the disk a second, you can't spend much time on the CPU processing each byte before the CPU becomes the bottle - you have on the order of 10-100 of clock cycles a byte, no more. Simple things like decoding utf-8 and checksumming can take a significant portion of this time, and that's before you're parsing anything.  (Hence stuff like protocol buffers...)<p>If you're trying to make a fast program you obviously avoid too much expensive I/O.  You can't avoid some latency, but you can often avoid a lot, and cache a lot, and place the rest closer to the consumer.<p>When you say I/O dominated, are you sure you don't mean: interactive website?  Because I think the real saving grace there is that's it's OK for websites to be very slow - from the perspective of a CPU.  It's not that the I/O <i>needs</i> to take a lot of time, it's that you have 100ms (and that's before ajax and relatives, which can hide even more latency), and you just don't need a lot of optimization to get into that restriction.  And once you have, the difference between 100ms and 1ns just doesn't matter nearly as much; so sure, <i>then</i> you start to accept very inefficient I/O setups even though much more efficient ones could be readily available.",1362216678

By a rough comparison it was on the order of 10000 times faster in C++ than the preexisting matlab implementation.  The cause was that the performance bottleneck was <i>not</i> in large matrix operations; instead, there were lots of iterative updates until convergence; this meant small vectors; a C++ template-based matrix library such as Eigen ends up inlining almost all of it into one no-allocation dense bit of math the traditional optimizer can milk for every last bit.<p>And it's not just about static/dynamic language differences here: practically, JIT might even do better by specializing the algorithm for a particular dimensionality, whereas that's impractical in C++ since you don't know the dimensionality until runtime.<p>Now, sometimes you can reduce your algorithm to some large-scale eigenvalue decomposition or whatever, and then numpy or similar might provide reasonable performance.  But it's <i>not</i> a very general solution because performance on small structures is terrible (and iterative simple updates are common in many algorithms).  JITted code relying on some underlying native library (like numpy) could never extract reasonable performance from this type of code; it would be forced to make many, many function calls in the innermost loop.",1362216033

I've had the experience of loosing a business after years of hard work and know exactly how painful it can be.  I want to try to help you with ideas but, again, please understand that, while I understand business, I do not understand the food business.  Here it goes.  In no particular order:<p>How would you sell your competitor's product?<p>Think about that.  If I wanted to hire you to sell my food product for me, how would you kick ass and take names?<p>List your top ten competitors (not just ethnic food).  What are their advantages over your business?<p>Why do you have to sell ethnic food?  Does anyone deliver burgers where you operate.  I mean, GOOD burgers?  How hard would it be to launch an experiment to sell an absolutely fucking-great would-kill-for-it ""asian burger"" for $10?<p>Can you sell other provider's food for them?  Why don't YOU become the catering service?  You might do far better this way than making your own food.  Are there other good ethnic food providers that you could market?  A supermarket does well because they have something to please everyone.  If I don't want your kind of food there's nothing you can do to make me buy it.  If, however, you offer me five different kinds of food choices you might actually have a sale every day of the week.<p>Can you package some food and sell it to roving food trucks (frozen, refrigerated, whatever)?<p>Call your local TV station.  Find out who you have to lather-up to get on TV with your exciting super-hip ethnic food offerings.  Be ridiculously upbeat.  Create hype.  Give them a reason to put you on TV.<p>Call every wedding and party planner you can find.  Maybe you can land a job that way.  I still think that if you are in the food business it might be wiser to not be in a super-narrow ethnic corner but rather be able to offer a wide range of choices.<p>Here in Santa Monica there's a regular event where a number of streets are closed from car traffic and food vendors put-up canopies and sell their stuff.  Anything like that going on where you are?<p>Any race tracks of any kind near you?  You could do lots of business if you could get a space at a good event.  Swap meets are the same.<p>Do you have the means to get a mobile food truck?  I don't know that business at all but I used to know someone who made good money with one.<p>Start an ethnic food meetup of some sort.  Charge $15 all you can eat (or whatever makes sense).  Get some music.  Make it fun.  Make it an event somewhere.<p>Any local camping areas?  Crazy idea, but maybe you can print some flyers ""we'll deliver your lunch to your campsite on Saturday"".<p>Talk to tour bus operators.  Maybe they have some ideas on how you could market your food to their customers.  Offer them a cut.<p>See if you can find any movie productions that need catering.<p>Contact Home Depot or Lowes.  I see guys with hot-dog stands right outside their doors there all the time.  Not a clue what it might take to be able to do something like that.<p>Offer a program through which you'll cook and deliver someone's lunch for the entire week.  Some might love the convenience of having five pre-packed meals in their refrigerator that they can just microwave at work and have something special that tastes good.<p>From watching the Gordon Ramsey shows I remember that, more often than not, he'd come in and grossly simplify the menus.  I don't have the experience to evaluate your menu.  Maybe you can get some help from a local culinary school?<p>He also did a lot of testing on the streets in some cases.  Cook-up a variety of samples for food you offer now and a few new ideas and go pass them out for free on the street. Ask for feedback.  You might discover that people aren't really in love with your food. For control I would have some tasty off-the-shelf microwave something to hand out as well.<p>I realize you probably need immediate income right now and might not have a lot of time or room for experiments.  This is a tough spot to be. Do your best to be creative and try a few out of the ordinary things.  You might just discover a gem.<p>Above all, don't be afraid of failure.  I know that while you are going through it the whole experience can be overwhelming both emotionally and physically.  Commit to the idea that if you fail to recover you will take a few steps back, critically analyze why you failed and come back stronger.  Maybe you need to take job for a while.  Do it.  If entrepreneurship were easy everyone would be doing it.  It isn't.  You are unique.  Don't give up.",1362215547

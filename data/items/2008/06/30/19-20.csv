That surely doesn't come across as the main point of the article, as it is only mentioned in a short 3 sentence paragraph that mostly consists of links to other articles.<p>I felt the article was a bit content-free. The main point I got out of it was that Ruby isn't elegant like Scheme or Smalltalk. This is the same sort of thing that has been repeated ad nauseum since the dawn of internet discussion. If Ruby is too gauche, Scheme and Smalltalk already exist and provide actual implementations of this strange symmetrical, consistent, mathemagical ""elegance"" that certain programmers get a boner over.

The inconsistency, crypticness, ability to make incomprehensible one-liners that actually did something useful - I truly felt like a wizard. Perl golf was a big hobby of mine. Unfortunately as soon as Java became the next big thing, Perl became totally not cool. To be honest, Perl was never ""cool"" anyway. The good Perl guys were all old systems administratiors who still posted ""rants"" to alt.kibology and only had sex when dressed in giant furry chipmunk suits.

I imagine there are many cases in which the different semantics are used intentionally.<p>This is really not a huge issue, b/c anyone who has worked with Ruby enough knows about it. It's mainly that the difference doesn't really make logical sense -- why would a ""proc"" behave differently from a ""lambda""? Also note that:<p><pre><code>  lamba { foo } \n</code></pre>\nmeans exactly the same as<p><pre><code>  proc { foo }\n</code></pre>\nwhich is different than:<p><pre><code>  Proc.new { foo }\n</code></pre>\nThis sort of smells, but it wouldn't if there were a new keyword to represent the way Proc.new behaves... then everyone would flex their Ruby muscles by writing confusing hacks that utilized the behavior of StrongReturnProc.new ... :)",1214852959

It's to be able to defend yourself against patent lawsuits. If you're sued, you can counter sue for infringing some stupid worthless patent in the pool, because any real implementation of anything infringes on <i>some</i> patent. With enough patents in the pool, counter-suit becomes a viable defense. Not also that this is why it won't work against patent trolls - they don't actually do anything of substance, and therefore aren't vulnerable to counter-suit.",1214852748

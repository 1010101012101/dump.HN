You sensed a “but” there?</i><p>Mark 1 against the author. The presumption that I would sense a &quot;but&quot; there makes you an asshole. Quit projecting onto other people. Beyond that, what &quot;but&quot; would there even be? I can&#x27;t even imagine a &quot;...but&quot; statement that would connect in a sensible manner to the previous statements. But what? But you don&#x27;t like icecream!? What exception is a person who &quot;sensed a but&quot; there supposed to expect?<p><i>>As I waded through that trainwreck of thread (I don&#x27;t recommend actually reading this, you will end up a worse person for it) a few thoughts struck me:</i><p>Mark 2 for the author being an asshole. The presumption that you are absolutely right with no ability to be wrong - so people should simply take you at your all-knowing word instead of investigate for themselves. A respectable person would say &quot;Take a look, make your own conclusions. All the evidence is right there in front of you.&quot; while an asshole would say &quot;judge them how I judge them because I&#x27;m right, don&#x27;t bother looking.&quot;<p><i>>we are seeing this deluded concept of freedom of speech butt heads with doing what is right.</i><p>The consistently loaded terminology to form a bias in the reader is quite annoying to read.<p>Free speech means that people have the right to say things you don&#x27;t agree with. In the letter of the law, it&#x27;s merely a guarantee you won&#x27;t be imprisoned for anything you say (with very few exceptions related to national security and local jurisdictions against hate speech and threats against another person). Regardless, when most people say freedom of speech they <i>actually</i> mean freedom of expression. Typically as defined by Article 19 of the ICCPR [0]. That includes opinions that the author might find distasteful.<p><i>>nor does it mean that anyone has to give you a platform from which you can spout your hate</i><p>Twitter is a public platform where anyone can spout their hate until Twitter decides to close their account. As a public platform, people are free to publicly criticize anyone using it as a platform. What the author should mean to say is that nobody is required to give the person an <i>audience</i>.<p>Personally, I agree with @meh - with the exception of working with a child molester. Knowledge of a crime and not reporting it would get me in trouble with the law. Furthermore, let&#x27;s make this example a bit less hyperbolic and more realistic.<p>&quot;Would you accept code and work with someone you know is a 3rd wave feminist?&quot;<p>The answer is, of course, yes. While I don&#x27;t agree with a majority of their views for various reasons - that doesn&#x27;t matter. If their code is up to scratch and they are contributing to the project, their personal beliefs <i>do not matter</i>.<p>In a hyperbolic statement:<p>&quot;Would you accept code and work with someone you know drinks alcohol?&quot;<p>Well I&#x27;d be shit out of luck if I didn&#x27;t. Nearly every single programmer I know drinks. I&#x27;m as rare as naturally occurring astatine. Luckily I&#x27;m able to put these sorts of differences behind me, because in the context of coding, they are unimportant. If I were running for President and my selected Vice was a self-declared Communist, these belief differences might matter a bit more.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/</a>",1435168756

But you need a higher-level architecture that controls everything in the app and that&#x27;s where MVP comes in.<p>There&#x27;s no framework per-se in GWT because MVP is so easy to implement.<p>View v = new ViewImpl(); // usually View is an interface or you can mock it...<p>Service s = new ServiceImpl(); // usually Service is an interface, or you can mock it...<p>Presenter p = new Presenter(service, view, models);<p>// in constructor<p>v.addListener(new Listener(){ public void execute(){ p.processData(); };});<p>p.getData(); // potentially calls service ajax request<p>p.persist(); // calls s.persist(model);<p>p.processData(); // potentially called by the event listener from the view, say user press a button<p>The idea of MVP is to be able to write unit-test (against the Presenter) that does not touch the widget level but able to cover everything else. Attaching a listener to ensure a code will be executed is considered &quot;configuration&quot;.<p>This MVP style differs to the one mentioned in the Ezra blog where the model calls Repository/Service. This MVP styles makes it explicit for Presenter to orchestrate the  Model, View, and Service interaction. No two way binding or implicit stuff.",1435168691

9773287,comment,9771493,9773187,0,0,narrator,,,"In the Vostok data the temperature falls first and then the CO2 falls.  If the CO2 released amplified the increased warming trend then why would the temperature suddenly reverse absent a CO2 drop?<p>BTW, I am really really disappointed in the quality of all the replies.  It&#x27;s mostly ad hominem and hand-waving.  This is the one reply that&#x27;s not but it doesn&#x27;t explain the behavior of the drop in temperature.<p>Thus to sum it up:<p>Increased temperature causes gas to become less soluble in the ocean, thus leading to increased CO2.  Decreased temperature causes CO2 to become more soluble in the ocean thus leading to decreased CO2.  This data shows then that CO2 increases are not enough to cause warming all by themselves or to prevent cooling all by themselves.<p>Obviously a very large amount of CO2 in the atmosphere will lead to warming (e.g Venus&#x27;s atmosphere is 96% CO2) but we&#x27;re many orders of magnitude off from that (0.04% CO2).<p>So we are left with what I like to call a Listerine argument:  Listerine has been selling more over the past century, Listerine prevents tooth decay, thus Listerine is the cause of the improvement in dental health over the past century.

This statement does not tell the whole story. The initial changes in temperature during this period are explained by changes in the Earth’s orbit around the sun, which affects the amount of seasonal sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface. In the case of warming, the lag between temperature and CO2 is explained as follows: as ocean temperatures rise, oceans release CO2 into the atmosphere. In turn, this release amplifies the warming trend, leading to yet more CO2 being released. In other words, increasing CO2 levels become both the cause and effect of further warming. This positive feedback is necessary to trigger the shifts between glacials and interglacials as the effect of orbital changes is too weak to cause such variation.",1435167865

I don&#x27;t know of any bright concise formulation of that stuff, and I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;d do it. I am fairly sure, though, that 5 pages could get the job done well enough to connect to spectroscopic observations.<p>Note also in the original story it was intended to be given to Einstein and Planck, deeply knowledgeable in classical physics, so it&#x27;d be natural to use analogies that would be more meaningful to them than to the typical CS/EE-oriented HN reader.

We already have many different rules and obligations for citizens and I don&#x27;t see this as a problem. Our currently problematic means of allowing naturalization is much more of an issue.<p>I do think that basic income needs to introduced gradually and needs to be paired with reductions in the minimum wage.<p>This reduction in the bottom range of wages will make more jobs economically viable (Since they have to produce less value to make a profit beyond the cost of the wages). It makes immigration less attractive to people earning the bottom range of wages without leaving our working poor in the lurch. This combined with the provision of basic income to citizens makes citizens more able to compete for low income jobs since they are being subsidized.",1435167631

Correlation of variables would be an issue if we were just looking at data to infer an explanation. Physicists have known the effects of radiative forcing of CO2 and methane because it has been observed in laboratory settings, and that knowledge has been extrapolated to models of the entire world.<p>The equation of &quot;heat in, heat out&quot; corresponds exactly as predicted.

There are some 25 constants in the standard model apparently that describe  the world around us to enormous precision. This is so little information that of course the trivial &#x27;overfitting by encoding observations directly&#x27; will fail, but we could still be overfitting by having an excess number of variables: perhaps there&#x27;s really some mechanism in neutrino physics that explains neutrino oscillation without needing some constants to describe how it really happens. This might in turn boost tremendously our predictive precision for neutrino oscillation to match the precision of the other more fundamental variables in the model, for example. But I think you&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s so little data that we have some strong information theoretic guarantees that at least the model will have predictive power matching the precision of previous measurements.",1435165711

9772968,comment,9770322,9771880,0,0,heavenlyhash,,,"Lots of people -- in that list, even -- started with XMPP based systems.  They all move away.  At first, I also thought this was an open and shut case of interest in lock-in.  Now, I&#x27;m not going to say that isn&#x27;t true, but it&#x27;s also worth considering that XMPP... just isn&#x27;t that good.<p>Having recently started working on a chat client that was intended to speak first-and-foremost XMPP, I have to admit: XMPP is... it&#x27;s decades out of date and missing a number of absolutely critical, central ideas that are essential to making stuff work.  I can&#x27;t honestly fault anyone who started with XMPP and then rapidly started looking to get off.<p>Examples:<p>- unique message IDs? Absent. XEPs kind of provide; but I can&#x27;t tell you which of the three or for relevant ones are the most relevant (AMP IDs from XEP 0079? Stream Management from XEP 0198? Acking from XEP 0184? Something from Carbons or MAM in 0313 or 0280? You know, if you wanted some light reading...).<p>- multi device? Oh. My. God. It&#x27;s bananas. The spec behavior is that whenever a client sends a message, the server is supposed to consider that one the most alive, and then route all future messages exclusively to that one. So you send a message on your phone? Yeah, your desktop is just going to silently stop receiving messages.<p>- there&#x27;s a concept of &quot;message carbons&quot; to deal with this. This involves re-sending all your messages back to the server after you receive them, with special instructions to send them back again to your other clients. The amount of redundantly redundant XML involved is eyewatering.<p>Combine that multidevice behavior (messages can get randomly routed anywhere at any time) with the wild-west nature of message delivery acks, and you can see how ridiculously difficult this makes the basic idea of &quot;all clients should see the same picture&quot;.<p>Overall, the XEP process, conceptually, is a great example of open extensibility. The trouble is, so much of this stuff is core to sane message delivery semantics that it really, practically speaking, causes huge problems when it&#x27;s all considered &quot;extensions&quot;. Stuff like message IDs fundamentally shouldn&#x27;t be an extension because it&#x27;s just too critical that all minimum-viable clients agree. You just can&#x27;t build higher level stuff without that. XEPs are great. A community process for extensions should exist. It just needs to exist for extensions, not subsume the total set of realistic minimum viable features.<p>I want an open chat protocol.<p>I thought XMPP might be the one. Then I actually looked at it. Tried to write something with it.<p>XMPP is not prepared to be the one, in any sense at all except for legacy support. I have all the respect in the world for all the folks who put effort into trying to make an open chat standard, but... honestly, we need a stronger foundation than this.<p>(N.b. These complaints are a shameless repost from another not-very-old thread about chat where XMPP was also raised: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9718784"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9718784</a> .)<p>I&#x27;ve since looked at matrix.org ... and I&#x27;m <i>really</i> impressed.  The standard is completely reasonable.  It&#x27;s the first federated chat standard I&#x27;ve seen proposed that actually has loose timing systems that&#x27;s both available during a partition and can reach consistency afterward (messages list their last-seen messages, and so act like vector clocks, an accepted good solution to problems in CAP territory).  You could actually take two systems with clock skew and have them reach a single, reconciled view of the world, even after netsplits.  And practically speaking... man, go look at their list of clients.  Despite being a relatively young project, matrix has clients on every major platform -- as far as I can tell, this is better platform coverage than XMPP, and better feature parity within those clients since critical things like message IDs are actually baked into the spec.  I really suggest giving matrix a look.  There&#x27;s a lot going right over there.",1435165648

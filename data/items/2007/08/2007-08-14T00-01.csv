What's wrong with being inspired by an example that runs counter to that perception?<p>It's pretty harsh to say that the poster is intolerant of older people because he expects fewer of them to have the startup mentality. At the very worst, it's just naive.",1187052691

(with a few outliers?)<p>In other words: Don't let the facts get in the way of a good opinion! :-)<p>I get you, and believe me I agree, but as entrepreneurs, it's always good to keep two things front and centre: <p>1. We live as part of a much larger world.
2. Our perceptions often lie to us.<p>If I'm the only one preaching that, so be it. Perhaps it helps one lucky person someday.",1187052344

42117,comment,42067,42067,0,0,pg,,,"Maybe the reason is that the enterprise market is downstream.  They're not the trendsetters.  If you get all the individual users using Macs, eventually big cos will have to switch.  Just as happened with desktop computers, in fact. <p>So maybe Apple ignores this market because they know they'll get it automatically (but only when) they're the default for individual users.",1187050381

First, the invite email was extremely vague - ""a new search engine that organizes information around people""?  I thought it might be a new human-assisted search site (something which has been in the news a bit lately), but wasn't sure.  Second, clicking the invite list brings you to a very basic sign-up page with no information.  As I went through the sign-up process, I really wasn't sure what I was actually getting myself into, but since I'm pretty trusting I just went ahead anyway. Once I finally got to the site, I still didn't know what it was, but I recognized that it was some sort of search engine, so I typed in a search for a bookstore I like and got one result - a person who said they liked something or other which happened to use the same word as the bookstore's name.  In the end, I really wouldn't have known what was going on at Spock if my friend didn't send me a link to an article about the site which nicely explained what it was.  It's actually a pretty interesting idea, and I can see that the site would work better once more people sign up. Still, Spock needs to work on their user experience, especially on their sign up process.  
(Additionally, although far less important, they need to work on their icon: their little person favicon looks exactly like the calvin klein logo.)",1187049900

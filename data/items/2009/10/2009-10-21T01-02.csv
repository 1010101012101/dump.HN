However ideally all the disks in an array would be from different lots.<p>Or, I believe that on some RAID controllers it is possible to add a third disk to a RAID1 pair, which means you could build the new disk before removing either of the old ones, thus there is never a single point of failure even during the disk replacement operation.",1256090385

Whereas if k is a loss, then both 2k and 2k + 1 are wins.  So part a) is really easy, because we can just repeatedly halve the numbers to figure out what the values should be, and part b) is also easy, because our proportion of wins to losses in the limit is described by a simple markov chain.<p>[edit: another minute's thought... actually, the obvious implication of the above is that every odd number is a win, and therefore losses are only those numbers with odd numbers of 2s in their prime factorizations]<p>In any case, I don't see why these questions belong on Hacker News.

It's already been discussed at length, so I'll just say I'm not convinced it's in Oracle's best interest to try to kill off InnoDB in order to decrease consumer options for MySQL. I guess we'll see what they do if the EC approves.<p>But the market for 'commercial services' around MySQL is doing just fine -- Percona and MontyDB being the most obvious (more here: <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/329626/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/329626/</a>).

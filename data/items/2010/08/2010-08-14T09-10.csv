<i>""Well, part of the point is (or will be) that most people on the Internet creates content. Like you just did when you wrote your comment. I guess this will be clearer when the API stuff gets going.""</i><p>While I do feel pretty unmotivated to explain what I mean,  I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt.<p>One of the more highlighted features of the Internet is that the line between customer and consumer has been blurred. Today you can create what was previously only known as a TV channels or newspapers in the form of video sharing or blogs. Even when traditional media publishes something, you can follow-up with your own view. Because of this and social media trends, <i>almost every Internet user is also a creator</i>. The upcoming Flattr API will let sites with user created content have their users flattr each other and take part of the revenue of those flattrs.",1281779670

1603197,comment,1601247,1601453,0,0,kelnos,,,"So wait, you're saying that you admire Oracle because they're evil and greedy and admit it, and that you admire Google much less because they have a ""don't be evil"" slogan but sometimes make missteps?<p>That sounds a bit shortsighted to me.  I suppose it's ok to find Oracle's forthright greed <i>refreshing</i>, but... <i>admirable</i>?  I find it awful.<p>I never thought of ""don't be evil"" as an end-all be-all promise to always do the right thing, no matter what.  It's a guiding principle, one that has to take the back seat in the face of more practical considerations sometimes.  We may not agree with all of those ""sometimes,"" but that doesn't make those decisions automatically wrong.  Google isn't perfect, but at least it seems like they <i>try</i> to have a social conscience.<p>Or maybe they've just done a good job of brainwashing me into thinking they do.",1281779066

1603183,comment,1602975,1603099,0,0,elliottkember,,,"I used to fly slope-soaring gliders back in Auckland, and I can't recommend it enough. A slope soarer is a little indestructible foam-and-tape plane that you hurl off a mountain - the wind against the slope provides lift, and you're off. The basic kit was about NZ$300 including the radio - you had to glue it together, sand it and tape it, which no time at all compared to balsa. Aerial combat was the best. Plus, running up and down hills all day got me quite fit.",1281777533

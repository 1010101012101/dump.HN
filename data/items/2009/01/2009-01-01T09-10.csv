416351,comment,415399,416297,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I have wondered why that back catalog isn't much larger. You would think it would be trivial for them to slap every game they made on there, plus license entire catalogs from other companies, given that they're just roms.<p>Their online gameplay was half-baked from the start. The day I got my Wii (2 days after it launched) I also bought Madden, only to end up pissed when I realized there was no online connectivity. It took forever for that stuff to actually work, though I will say that now that it's there, and unlike Xbox it's free, it's pretty nice.",1230803658

My use case is probably different from your larger corporate or workgroup users since I want to use it with clients and prospects so pay per whiteboard or some other scheme that doesn't have me buying the 100 user model would be worth a discusion. But it's handy and it feels like a white board (once I get used to drawing with a mouse). Happy to see you turn pro.",1230803543

The Stanley Cup finals are pretty much the only time I'll find myself looking for somewhere to watch live TV.<p>I don't even bother with Netflix. You can download any new releases, often before you can find the DVDs (especially during Oscar season, when all of those screeners end up leaked) and full seasons of any TV shows. You do usually miss out on the commentary though if you're into that.",1230803536

416347,comment,415933,416108,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I agree things are speeding up, but think it's largely because Microsoft is now realizing that they need to keep IE up to date and standards compliant. They still have 70%market share, and it's not shrinking fast, so the onus is entirely on them. IE7 is kind of a sucky browser but a step in the right direction in terms of compliance, and IE 8 will be much better.",1230803294

They are useful for transforming head-recursive code into tail-recursive code.<p>Granted, accumulators can't really improve code that traverses trees. But for code that traverses lists, like zip... accumulators can be useful. Also, the added complexity isn't too bad.",1230802815

However, I think you really need to focus on making the purchase page more structured towards helping the buyer make a proper decision. Right now it's a sea of text and a row of prices. I'm inclined to ignore the text and choose the lowest price, even if it's not in my best interest.<p>This post at 37 Signals is a great reference for you: <a href=""http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1496-design-decisions-the-new-highrise-signup-chart"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1496-design-decisions-the...</a>",1230801402

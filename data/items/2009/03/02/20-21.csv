Obviously somebody posted the article, so it means something to somebody. After a while, I'm going to stop reading all these college vs. no college articles. So will everyone else, I imagine. Nature will take it's toll.<p>I trust my fellow posters to come on here with an open mind. That's not out of any kindness on my part -- it's simply a practical matter.

Obviously both of us feel that there is some information that is being exchanged that is worthwhile about some tangential part of this topic.<p>I think I come at this from the standpoint of having to work with people all day long that have strong opinions about technology. If I had an option of simply ignoring subjects that my clients found difficult to come to grips with, my work would be a lot easier. And nothing would get done.<p>Yes. There are some topics that people tend to talk past each other. Those are the most important ones to talk about. What? You want to spend your time on things nobody feels strongly about? <i>As long as the chat is productive</i>, bring it on. If it's not productive, downvote it, ignore it, and move on. Just like anything else that's not worthy of your or my time.<p>EDIT: I don't want to look like I'm changing my opinion, so what I mean is that there are some topics that people tend to associate directly with their judgment and self-worth. Religion is one of those. Politics is another. But gee, it can be anything. This emotional entanglement is just a part of human nature and is part of real-world conversations.",1236027351

In the model society near the end the banker loans Dagny a car and says that it isn't free he's charging her for it. As he shows Dagny around he explains how they charge each other for everything. Even husbands and wives pay each other one way or another. I wouldn't want to live in a society like that. Making personal or even business relationships primarily about money causes all sorts of problems. People need to be paid fairly, but focusing too much on money destroys intrinsic motivation. I'll fix my parents computer for free because I want to help them, but I wouldn't do the same thing just for money. Even trying to keep track of how many favors I've done for my friends would cause too many problems.

You know what you are getting.<p>When you hear a 30 second song clip or see a movie trailer, you get a selectively packaged subset of the full product. I have heard many clips and seen many trailers that are simply awesome, and then the actual song or movie ends up being terrible.<p>So the analogy would be better if you got to hear the song once for free, and then had to buy to own, which is kind of between the two extremes now (leech it or buy it unheard). Radio (traditional or internet-based) does a decent job of this now, but only for singles. There is still no way to try a whole album before buying unless you catch it on the headphones in Best Buy.<p>The trouble with movies is that generally you don't watch them many times. I can't really speak for everyone there, but I know I would be much more willing to pay for movies if I could get a good 720p copy of it for say $10-15. The reason I don't buy movies now is that I don't want a pile of DVDs in my tiny apartment. I could buy them, rip them, then resell them, but as I understand it, this is just as illegal as downloading them to begin with. So to summarize, give us some format options besides just a DVD that costs $23.",1236026694

More important, do you speak Chinese?<p>I've spent a lot of time in Southeast Asia, but only a couple months in China. One thing that struck me there was that it's one of the few places where you really can't get by in English alone. I mean sure, you can feed yourself and find places to sleep, but it's really tough to get to know the people because pretty much nobody speaks any English at all. I met some Chinese-speaking Americans along the way, and it was simply amazing to see what I'd been missing out on.<p>Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, etc. are much easier places to get by as an English speaker. They figured out long ago that nobody is going to learn Laotian, so they'd better start labeling things in English. China never had that problem, so it's still a bit painful to travel in unless you know the language.<p>So yeah, if you know what you're getting into, then I bet you're going to have a great time.

500547,comment,500156,500156,0,0,russell,,,"Paul makes some very good points. He advocates exception handling at the level of the unit of work.  The problem is what is the unit of work?  As an example, I was setting up a new Jboss installation and deployment of an application that I am only getting familiar with. Catalina threw an exception about something in the configuration, but didn't log anything. Finally, JBoss caught the exception and just logged that the deployment had failed.  The piece of code that found the problem could have told me what was wrong.<p>Paul says that checked exception are a horrible mistake, because they cause premature catching of exceptions, because ignoring the exception means that the programmer has to change the signature of his method.  I find swallowed exceptions all over the place in reading code.  And methods in the Sun libraries exacerbate the problem by throwing multiple checked exceptions that have to be swallowed.  So to keep method signatures at a reasonable length, more swallowed exceptions.  Generic exceptions with error codes, like SQLException, would make more sense.<p>Given the reality of Java Exception handling, I favor catching the exception at the point where a reasonable error message can be composed and logged., Then throwing an unchecked exception to be caught at the level of the unit of work.<p>Finally, Paul says always use finally to clean up your mess.",1236024757

I have already taken classes in C, Unix and Java.<p>For me, it has been great to be able to take classes that I am actually interested in instead of just the ones that involve the least work like many of my friends have (CS is the only department with that many specialized classes).<p>I wasn't forced to choose a specialization, if I was, I probably would not have chosen CS at the time. I chose different classes freshman year and started to gravitate towards CS as a sophomore. There was no commitment so I could have stopped CS and focused on something else if it turned out that I didn't like it.",1236024570

They believe that we should work to improve the material conditions of the world's least-well-off humans.<p>Ayn believes these people are evil. However, talking to them, I do not believe these people are evil. I believe they are good people.<p>Their instincts are human. It is human nature to be made sad by the suffering of others.<p>Alleviating the suffering of others is one of many things that human value. However, holding this as your highest moral value can lead you to do things that others dislike. For example, you may be motivated to pass laws that take the property from one person and give it to another that needs it more.<p>Now, humans ALSO value property rights, and some notion of property rights seems just to most people. I am sure you place some value on property rights.<p>These two instincts drive people to take actions that contradict each other. It is the nature of humanity.<p>Now, the true believer will insist that there is one right answer and no real contradiction, but their arguments get flimsy and tired after awhile.<p>I was never ""dissuaded"" from Objectivism. Rather, I grew away from it over time. I guess I got tired of looking up the answers to tough questions in a book, instead of puzzling them out for myself. Also, the logic just gets thin and unconvincing over time, as when Ayn tries to prove that one moral axiom is better than another. You can't do it. They are axioms. You can't say that a person is wrong for feeling sad at other people's misfortunes (well, Ayn can). It is just a fact.",1236024474

I really don't know why programmers don't get it: nobody cares about the technology, they only care what you can do for them.<p>I'm building my first webapp. I'm an embedded software developer: what I know about HTML, CSS & web programming could fit into a thimble. But it's enough to build the app I want to do. The thing is, if I were to bounce the idea off a few programmers I'd immediately hit with resistance: ""so and so is already doing it,"" ""no, you need to add this..."" ""why would anyone use that when they could use Excel..."" etc.<p>My idea isn't groundbreaking or innovative. I'm just taking a common task that many non-technical people need to do and simplifying it. And hopefully I can make it easy enough to use that they will part with enough of their hard-earned dollars each month to make it worth my time.",1236024387

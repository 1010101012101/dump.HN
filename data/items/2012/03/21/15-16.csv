3734943,comment,3733979,3734367,2,0,w0utert,,,"One thing you didn't mention in your article, but which I think is a relevant and interesting observation to make, is that 'your code =/= your identity' works both ways.<p>It's not just that you should not project messy code onto someone's personality/identity, but you also cannot reliably do the inverse. I know people who are meticulously organized in everything they do in real life, who hate to be around a mess, who always want schedules, predictability and stability in their daily life, who optimize their daily routines to perfection. Yet they write lousy code, take shortcuts, do not think the problems they solve through enough, etc. Likewise, I know people who are chaotic in every way, who don't adhere to many of the things almost everyone else considers to be the norm, who have little to no self-discipline for mundane tasks, who are non-conformist by choice, and who are often perfectly aware of these shortcomings. Incidentally, I count myself into this group. Despite all this, I consider the code I write to be very thorough, organized, maintainable, proven to be very resilient to bugs, efficient, etc. The process that gets me there may not be the prettiest, thought-out, elegant process you could imagine, my workspace may be cluttered with 10 terminals, my temp dirs maybe full of old cruft, and so on, but still, I consider the products of my work to have all the qualities I seem to lack in real life.<p>So apparently, personality really doesn't say much (if anything) about the quality of the software you write. It's a profession that is so far from our daily lives that you cannot project one onto the other or vice versa, exactly like you already wrote.",1332345505

Using your MLK/slavery example, why are you apologizing?  You are apologizing because you empathize with the black/white person you offended with your statement.  You cannot do so if you still hold slavery to be good; if you maintain your belief in slavery as you say this not-apology statement, then you are placating or mollifying or appeasing.<p><pre><code>    >We need to make sure we are not \n    >trying to tell people how to think. \n</code></pre>\nYou follow this with suggesting something like Socratic-methodizing them, which is basically a mechanism to get people to think your way.<p><pre><code>    >it's not okay for a mob to dictate to you \n    >what your policies should be\n</code></pre>\nMaybe it's not ""ok"" (whatever that might mean), but it's reality: see law, ethics, morals, common values, cliques, villages, associations,  ""shunning"" or any other ""mob"" defined construct/action...

3734938,comment,3728316,3731345,2,0,lambda,,,"> Please show me a study which demonstrates caffeine's neurotoxicity in humans if you're going to make a claim like that. I can only find ones exploring neurotoxicity in rats and at some pretty high doses.<p>> Nicotine has only been found to be neurotoxic in adolescents or in extremely high doses. At the normal rate of consumption, it acts as an anti-oxidant and has a protective effect on the brain.<p>That's exactly my point. Just because something is a neurotoxin for some animals, or at extremely high doses, does not mean that it's actually dangerous. I wasn't trying to make caffeine or nicotine sound dangerous; I was pointing out that looking at some research, seeing ""neurotoxic"", and being scared is a bad way of approaching science.<p>Obviously, there are dangers in alcohol consumption. Alcohol has a fairly narrow range between the effective dose (the dose at which you start noticing any effects), and a dangerous dose. There are the obvious cognitive impairments while you are drinking, and some slight longer term impairment (that is much worse for heavy drinkers, and even worse for people who were heavy drinkers and then quit). But there are also advantages. There are some physical advantages to alcohol consumption, related to heart disease. There are the obvious social advantages, which many people cite as the reason they drink. And looking at all-cause mortality, the advantages appear to outweigh the disadvantages, at least for moderate drinkers.<p>> What if people who choose to drink in moderation just happen to be more likely to do everything else in moderation too? What if people who choose to abstain are more likely to fall into extremes and affect their life span that way? What if someone who moderates everything else and chooses not to drink is healthier than the moderate drinkers?<p>There is also this study: <a href=""http://while-science-sleeps.com/pdf/628.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://while-science-sleeps.com/pdf/628.pdf</a> which discusses the weaknesses in previous studies, and attempts to correct for them. They look at a quite wide range of potential factors that might be correlated with abstention and increase mortality. The findings are somewhat surprising: in this study, even heavy drinkers had a lower mortality rate than teetotalers. And these effect were still present, though diminished, even once they controlled by many compounding factors.<p>It does admit that:<p>> In fact, in tests of potential covariates, we found among these older adults that at baseline, abstainers were significantly more likely to have had prior drinking problems, to be obese, and to smoke cigarettes than moderate drinkers and significantly higher than moderate drinkers on health problems, depressive symptoms, and avoidance coping. Moreover, at baseline, abstainers were signicantly lower than moderate drinkers on SES, physical activity, number of close friends, and quality of friend support and signicantly less likely to be married than moderate drinkers. Moreover, all of these covariates signicantly predicted mortality.<p>However, it goes on to state:<p>> Controlling for age and gender, all eleven additional covariates, and the gender-marital status and gender-avoidance coping interactions in the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis reduced the 20-year mortality risk for abstainers compared to moderate drinkers. After including all covariates, the relative mortality risk for abstainers compared to moderate drinkers dropped by close to one-third and approached that of heavy drinkers. However, even after adjusting for all covariates, abstainers and heavy drinkers continued to show increased mortality risks of 49 and 42%, respectively, compared to moderate drinkers. After adjusting for all covariates, the relative risk for light drinkers compared to moderate drinkers was no longer significant.<p>Now, this study was for older adults (who were 55 to 65 at the beginning of the 20 year study). It discusses in some detail the weaknesses that it has, such as the possibility that it has selected for people who have survived higher levels of drinking. However, it did a very good job of controlling for a lot of compounding factors; and it still found that people who drank had lower mortality rates than people who abstained.",1332345438

There is the history of women being objectified to promote and sell things, and the better part of society has decided that this history is in poor taste and is something to rise above, especially for a professionally affiliated event. There is no comparable history for men, and any event objectifying them as a promotion would clearly be seen as being tongue in cheek - the kind of joke the backpedaling event organizers here would like to be seen as having made, but one that cannot be made honestly in such a straightforward way because of the asymmetry of the social treatment of women and men historically.

But I'm hoping more manufacturers will start using metal or some very solid material in their phones, because it will be hard for me to use something that feels significantly weaker and cheap.<p>That being said, the Legend is the worst HTC phone from that period, software wise. It's one of the most locked down phones ever. It took me like 7 hours to get to root it and install a custom ROM on it, because I had to jump over a ton of hoops to be able to do it and the process was very complicated. It only took about an hour to root and put a custom ROM on an LG Optimus One, considering these both times are the first time I've ever rooted a phone.",1332344777

3734874,comment,3734127,3734127,5,0,bobbydavid,,,"There are a couple forces at work here.<p>First, the tech/hacker world tends to be male-dominated, which creates a male-oriented culture, which reciprocally draws more men, and the cycle continues. We want to break that cycle, and a good way to do that is to snap at the heels of people (like Sqoot) who are slow to get with the program. Overall, this sort of admonishment improves the community. I'm glad it's happening.<p>Second, anyone who has first-hand seen or experienced being subjected to this type of offensive comments will almost certainly have an emotional interest in the matter. It feels pretty good to watch someone burn at the stake, especially when day in and day out you watch others get away with making similar comments. Just scroll through the comments on Sqoot's apology and you'll find some pretty visceral remarks.<p>The problem is, it may feel good but it doesn't help. Here's why: As blatantly offensive as the original comment was, it wasn't written with the intent of bashing women -- it was just plain insensitive. Grossly insensitive and very hurtful? Yes. But there's an important difference between being insensitive and being malicious.<p>Why does it matter? Because if you truly have the goal of improving the community, insensitive/ignorant behavior needs to be met with <i>education</i>. Otherwise, all we get is an ""Us vs. Them"" mentality, which leads me to the third force at work here: defensiveness.<p>Sqoot's initial apology, along with many of the comments on this new one, reek of defensiveness. It's easy to see why: those people are most likely just as oblivious as Sqoot, and they see themselves in Sqoot's behavior. Don't alienate those people and don't put them on the defensive by being overly harsh on Sqoot. That pushes people away from the conversation -- the very people who most need to be educated.<p>There needs to be a clear distinction between Sqoot's words (not tolerated) and Sqoot's mistake (mistakes must be tolerated).",1332344675

And now I see what you're saying regarding inequality: that prior to redistribution, inequality is more or less universal. To use your phrase, well, duh. Remember that the point of my original comment was that Europe's more progressive tax structure addresses the problem of income inequality, where the less progressive tax structure of the US does not. You responded by saying the US tax structure is more progressive. Then you cited an article which explicitly argues my point, that other nations more effectively address income inequality with progressive taxation than does the US.<p><i>And, I've never said that Europe has a fairer tax policy.</i><p>You said (and repeated again here) that the US has a more progressive tax system, that the wealthy pay a greater share of taxes here than almost anywhere else in the world. I took that to be a criticism, that you believe progressive taxation is unfair. If so, then a country like Germany (which according to you puts <i>less</i> of a tax burden on the wealthy) is fairer overall than the US. I understand that you're trying to avoid <i>saying</i> they're fairer, but that's the inescapable conclusion of your argument that US taxes are more progressive.<p><i>[Y]ou didn't bother to look for the second number, the tax revenue share.</i><p>I didn't bother to look for it because it was already there in your source and I assumed it was a pretty solid number, since it's based on tax records. Judging the share of income seems a much more likely source of error since it requires more estimation.<p>Now you've got me wondering how accurate that tax number is, too. Your source put the share of taxes at 45.1% in the mid-2000s. Yet the same source puts the 2009 number at 70%. Do you really believe that the share almost doubled in four years? It's a lot more likely that you're misinterpreting the numbers, or the source is simply wrong. This chart from the conservative Heritage Foundation is more consistent: <a href=""http://www.heritage.org/budgetchartbook/top10-percent-income-earners"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heritage.org/budgetchartbook/top10-percent-income...</a> .<p>I found a reference for German taxes that puts their top 10%'s share at 60% in 2005 (<a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=germany+top+10%25+share+of+taxes&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CD0QFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de%2Finstitute%2Ffinanzen%2Fcorneo%2Fdp%2FBCS_EffectTaxRate_2011-06-20.pdf&ei=EfJpT9HEFfGCsgKn-7GyDw&usg=AFQjCNGTzjv8l2MV1uoCh_-3txMiEwEWpA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=germany+top+1...</a>). The same source indicates that the top 10% in Germany earned 33% of the gross income, 29% net.<p>So taking 60%/33% you get a ratio of 1.82, significantly higher than your US value of 1.63.

It brings order of events to a pattern which for the most part is designed to be unordered. I have developed two patterns to deal with modifying messages when the need arises and I am still not sure which I like better.<p>The first is I clone the message and pass a mutable and immutable copy of the data, this seems to work ok but you still have to ensure order of events, so if the message passing pattern guarantees first in first out, I just make sure the registration sequence of modifying listeners are registered first. It is not bullet proof but it has worked for my needs.<p>The second pattern I have used is a concept of a preprocessor routine, kind of a method that does all the modification before the message event is fired, so I wire the data to the preprocessor and then the preprocessor fires off the message event after it has made it's modification.",1332344092

The best you can get beyond a certain level of intelligence is improvements based on either subject level experience (intuition in the mathematical fields) or conscious changes that you do on a day to day basis. Unfortunately, this kind of requires that one is open to not being so dickish about the validity and absolute cleverness of one's solutions and be open to learning new stuff. Sad to say this but I agree with your assertion that both engineers and companies that hire them suffer under the delusion that intelligence is correlated with trivia know how.

3734692,comment,3734127,3734577,8,0,ianterrell,,,"I think the argument that it was a joke is hard to swallow. It doesn't even approach humor to me. A commenter on the apology got it right:<p>> From the original press release it sounded like you were just trying to throw a party with ""hot waitresses serving drinks""<p>I'm not rmc and I won't answer for him, but I'll answer your queries from my own point of view.<p>Do I believe that they're sexist because of that one statement? Yes, I do, absolutely, but: does that imply that I think that ""they look down on women, and think they shouldn't be working in the industry?"" No, I don't believe their sexism is of that sort.<p>I think that most sexism in the US today is significantly more subtle than an outright looking down on women. In this case, its subtlety makes it all the more pernicious: it's harder to spot (even in one's self), it's harder to call out, it's easier to excuse. Saying women are trash will make you into a pariah, and no one will patronize your business. But what does a much smaller objectification of women, like this case, do? It has a chilling effect and it normalizes similar behavior; it contributes to the culture of sexism.<p>Are statements (""jokes"") with such negative effects acceptable? It's hard to argue that they are, and so it seems to me that the argument in defense must be that the statement doesn't have those effects. And I think from the backlash, well written comments on the apology, etc--I think that's a steep hill to climb.<p>As for them personally: I don't think it should be judged that they're bad people. Maybe they are, maybe they aren't. I don't know. Are they sexist? I said they were, absolutely, because their behavior was, which they're culpable for. So they're sexist even if only partially and unconsciously. I'll give them that benefit of the doubt, so it's an offense, but it's a forgivable offense. There's a lot of sexism around. I've been guilty of sexist behavior in the past, and I'm sure I'll be guilty of it in the future.<p>That's what happens when it's ingrained in culture and remains normal behavior. And <i>that's</i> what happens when statements like this are allowed to slide. We do things without knowing their full weight, meaning, and impact. And then we learn, and we adjust. And most importantly, through adjusting our behavior we introspect to the causes, and so learn more about ourselves and our world, and what makes it all tick, so that we can eliminate that which doesn't live up to our ideals.",1332342345

It integrates into the Visual Studio 2005/2008/2010 environment and allows you to detect errors in C/C++/C++11 programs. Regarding its advantages, we can note usability, detailed documentation, on-the-fly analysis and the best diagnostics of 64-bit errors.<p>-= The reason for the secret =-<p>Unfortunately, being one of the PVS-Studio's creators, I'm sad about the number of the distribution package's downloads from the site. They are very few. I see the reason: people are accustomed to thinking that it's not so easy for a programmer to try a commercial analyzer. You have to deal with the commercial manager at first and only then you might be allowed to get the demo version. I think many people even don't try to visit the Download page waiting to see a huge fill-in form or a message kind of ""if you want to try, write to us"".<p>We don't approve this method. We believe that a person should be able to easily try and purchase a software product. Our opinion completely coincides with the one of Alex Payne who has written the article ""How Not To Sell Software in 2012"": http://al3x.net/2012/02/29/how-not-to-sell-software-in-2012.html.<p>-= The secret =-<p>The secret thing about PVS-Studio is that nobody knows that you can easily try and purchase it. Moreover, PVS-Studio can be used for free at first. The version you download from the site is completely full-function!<p>The demo version's restrictions will only occur when you have fixed 100 errors in your program using our tool. If your project is small or contains just a few errors, you will be able to use PVS-Studio without purchasing a license. But if you have fixed 100 errors in your program with PVS-Studio, it's fair that you buy a license to go on eliminating both old and fresh errors.<p>Download and try PVS-Studio: http://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio-download/",1332342237

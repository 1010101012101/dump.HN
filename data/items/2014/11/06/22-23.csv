Most &quot;miles&quot; in cars are commuter miles... getting to work, getting to the store, getting home again.<p>Motorcycles on the other hand are generally not commuter vehicles, and riders tend to be self-selected for high risk.  From people obsessed with speed, to motorcycle gangs who were no gear, to the weekend rider who has very little experience...  It even applies to route selection, the trip to the store is well understood, but if you want to have a nice ride on the weekend, you will probably go far off your normal path.  Different vehicle type, less miles logged, unfamiliar territory and often inappropriate gear do lead a high risk of injury.<p>Riding on a motorcycle is risky business, but so is riding a pedal bike in a city.  It can be done practically and reasonably, I even used it as my primary form of travel for a little over a year... but it requires proper gear, a full understanding of the bike (and your place on the road), how avoiding an accident differs on a bike from a car.<p>It will never be as safe as a car, but in the hands of a conscientious intelligent rider, it isn&#x27;t the death trap it is often saddled with... it is a calculated risk, like many others people take...",1415314589

From there they then traveled north to Melbourne, then headed west.  Apparently they had engine trouble and had to stop in Perth as well.  From there the proceeded to stop in Durban and Montevideo before returning to Virginia.  It was a long trip...<p>The kicker is that he had the foresight to buy film cameras (one color, one BW) before this and filmed a bunch of stuff.  A couple years ago, while preparing for a move, my grandmother found a box with reels and reels of footage, unlabeled and not in any particular order.  She took it to a film processing shop, and together with people there, they pieced together a probable timeline and spliced together ~90 minutes of interesting footage out of heap and digitized it.  So now I have a DVD with some pretty cool footage of that trip.  Elephants, albatross, icebergs, heavy machinery down in Antarctica... that must have been an amazing trip for a guy who grew up in small-town Illinois.<p>My family still has the coat and rucksack he was issued, with his name on it and a pretty cool seal/patch.<p>After that, my grandfather went on to do a bunch of other kickass things, like found a couple engineering startups in Boston in the 60s, with varying success: flip a couple, get screwed by some shady folks... the works.<p>Partly because of his story, I&#x27;m heading down to Antarctica early next year, though not on anything quite so cool: just taking a two-week cruise, but I&#x27;m excited to be retracing his steps in a way.",1415314444

8570299,comment,8567721,8570045,0,0,zanny,,,"> I patch both your boot loader and your kernel with a rootkit. This should be laughably easy for the level of adversary we&#x27;re talking about.<p>Well, you won&#x27;t be getting the kernel, its on the drives. It would have to be in a separate partition so you can start it before mounting the sensitive filesystems, and you may have a key that the bootloader uses on it, but in either case if you are not present and a sever goes offline you basically have to do the following:<p>Verify the ROMs integrity in that first stage - before you put in the key for your actually sensitive data. That means you need open firmware or some mechanism to hash the ROM that is installed, you need to have a means to read it in its entirety, and then you need to hash it.<p>I say open firmware because you need to be able to guarantee the FBI couldn&#x27;t embed a backdoor firmware. If you can get open spec / openfirmware mainboards and verify their authenticity only then can you be safe.<p>Then you verify the kernel, which is much easier because you can compile it yourself, maybe even pad it with some random and scramble the ELF tables in some custom orientation.<p>And then you need to worry about how you input the key - if its by USB, you can backdoor the USB and network controllers and keylog in hardware depending on the vendor and model of the mainboard. Over the network, just the NIC is in question, because any secret sharing over ethernet better be over a secure connection.<p>But that should be it. It is a fine line at best, and a bottomless pit at worse, but there are ways to try to be hardware secure.",1415314074

You&#x27;ve jumped from there to cell phones.<p>The access is blanket given warrants like the FISA verizon one, and there&#x27;s nothing to stop targeted surveillance like that which we know goes on on gmail/skype/etc accounts when requested. To be clear, I&#x27;m not suggesting that cell phones or this device are all constantly recording what we do and transmitting direct to the NSA right now, but that they could in a targeted manner be used to do so if someone became of interest, and that this Amazon device would be a particularly powerful bug given the great microphones, constant power and fixed location in a home.<p>Re cell phones, I don&#x27;t think it would be very hard to present a blank screen and wake up only on significant audio to record/broadcast on a hacked phone. I&#x27;m sure a paranoid user would eventually notice, but the capability is certainly there - probably that sort of thing is very rare and sophisticated, it&#x27;s not something I worry about personally, but I do think it is quite possible.

From the perspective of someone who is from Mexico, I can attest that at least the general consensus is that the cartels derive the majority of their power from their interactions with the US market: most of their money from selling drugs north of the border, most of their strength from buying weapons from US sellers. They have some more local sources of income (extortion, protection rackets, kidnapping, theft) but in cash terms all of those pale compared with the drug business. As for weapons? They definitely don&#x27;t have any local manufacturing capabilities and I doubt they have any suppliers not from the U.S. at the moment.<p>At this point, legalization won&#x27;t be the full solution for the problems with the Mexican cartels, but it&#x27;s probably the single best thing that can be done to combat the issue. More effective than armed intervention, faster and more reliable than any current attempts to boost the Mexican rural economy (lack of jobs and very low earnings from normal crops is part of what allows drug cartels to recruit enforcers easily and convince farmers to grow pot instead of wheat) and definitely easier to implement than any anti-corruption measure targeting the Mexican institutions (which have corruption as a very endemic historical problem and rooted in ways that most anglo-saxon countries cannot fully imagine).<p>Edit: That said, this is an interesting counterpoint: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/opinion/global/mexicos-deadly-power-vacuum.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/opinion/global/mexicos-dea...</a> by a very respected subject expert (Dr. Buscaglia), arguing that larger and wealthier criminal organizations than the Mexican cartels exist in other countries, and that the main reason for the cartel-related violence in Mexico and not say in Russia, China or the U.S. is the relative weakness of the state and the job-generating economy.",1415313722

I&#x27;ve raised this development there, as it may spur the discussion forward.<p>Goldilocks is one of the potential curves on the table there. There&#x27;s potential enthusiasm for recommending two curves: one strong, fast curve with ≈128-bit workfactor (quite likely Curve25519 in my opinion) and one super-strength curve, at least 192-bit workfactor (possible candidates include MS Research &quot;NUMS&quot; P384/P512, Curve41417, Ed448-Goldilocks, and E-521). The option of generating entirely new Brainpool-style random curves isn&#x27;t off the table either, and some have been asking for that, but I&#x27;m <i>really</i> not sold: the software performance of random curves is absolutely dreadful, the implementation can be the kind of hairball we want to avoid, those asking seem to be asking because they&#x27;re heavily committed to hardware with aged generic (RSA-targeted) hardware multipliers with anti-side-channel blinding that is no longer great and doesn&#x27;t work right over special primes - and besides, if we wanted Brainpool, we could just use Brainpool. (Brainpool is indeed in this GnuPG release if you want it.)<p>If I was not performance-sensitive and wanted the highest level of security I could reasonably get from curves, maybe I&#x27;d choose E-521, which has impressive rigidity, being independently discovered and confirmed by multiple research teams, and good performance for its class due to being a Mersenne prime. But you do pay quite a bit of performance to go from the ≈224-bit to the ≈250-bit+ range, and it&#x27;s not clear to me that&#x27;s particularly meaningful in all cases. (Of course, maybe PGP <i>is</i> one of those cases, and performance isn&#x27;t usually a big deal there unless it&#x27;s <i>really</i> bad.)<p>Regarding SPHINCS, 41KB signatures are remarkable for what they are, but not practically ideal for OpenPGP, especially with the way the keyservers are now, but you know, I could maybe live with it. I could see it start to get ugly for keys with a lot of verifying counter-signatures on them, however.<p>Do remember OpenPGP <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> bring everything to the table: for example, forward security. And MUAs have a reputation for <i>awful</i> UX regarding it - operator error is extraordinarily frequent. But it seems to at least be Pretty Good in practice. Thanks Werner & team!",1415312825

This is a genuine question.<p>I feel like in any case, there are some things that should just not be done in C. For example, the base64 encoder/decoder that gpg uses for ASCII-armoring should not be written in C; in general any parser should not be written in C; there&#x27;s no reason for the code that interfaces with the user (for example, checking a password given to gpg-agent) to be written in C. You could write these in OCaml, use the FFI to natively link them into a single executable, and you&#x27;d have safety for string handling while retaining fine-grained control of the hardware during crypto.<p>However, I&#x27;m skeptical that you literally cannot use OCaml to implement crypto that&#x27;s secure against timing attacks. You can always fall back to C for primitive operations, and you can control the garbage collector enough that gc pauses wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.<p>IMO, the most compelling reason not to do this is that for all its fatal flaws, C is the most widely-used systems programming language, and so it has the largest share of experts ready to review code. But this doesn&#x27;t seem like a good enough reason, given the severity of memory corruption bugs.",1415311400

We have learned a tremendous amount from the feedback we have been getting and I am happy with the performance of the campaign (we have a conversion rate of 20 percent). However, we have reached the point where we are not not learning anything new from this process and it is consuming resources that we would prefer to spend on product development.<p>What would you do in this situation? Stop engaging new users who sign up or simply provide lower-quality feedback? (People send us their Excel spreadsheets to learn if they are good candidates for conversion to apps -- which is what the product does -- and analyzing these spreadsheets is time-consuming.)<p>I would like to think that engaging with users this early has the added benefit of creating solid beta testers down the road when our prototype is ready, but I am concerned about not being able to devote more time to product development.

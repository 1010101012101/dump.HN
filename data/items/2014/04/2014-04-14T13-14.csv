You have to think of them as two different data types, and so when you want to use a value presented as one of the types as the other type, you don&#x27;t have to &quot;sanitize&quot; it, even calling it &quot;escaping&quot; is confusing - you have to _convert_ it.

7586135,comment,7581865,7585262,1,0,tel,,,"The non-nullable types are trivially implemented in Haskell. From what I can tell the flow control analysis you&#x27;re talking about is just type inference (another thing well tackled in ML-like languages).<p>Indeed, everything you&#x27;ve written can be fairly trivially implemented in Haskell, though inference and annotation would feel different. The real challenge comes in when you&#x27;ve got an arbitrary &quot;test&quot; expression which must be satisfied by the statics of your language.<p>For instance, your original example had ensure blocks<p><pre><code>    ensure { x.left > 10 && x.right < 30 }\n</code></pre>\nthe problem is that it&#x27;s very difficult for the compiler to take constraints like these and propagate them through increasingly complex transformations <i>without</i> just representing the entire language at the type level.<p>Which is exactly the path taken by &quot;DT&quot; languages like Agda, Coq, Idris, ATS. The upshot is that you get arbitrarily powerful static queries. The downside is that your type system is exactly as complex as your language itself and you have to shuffle around proofs of various invariants being held because it&#x27;s an NP-complete search problem for the compiler to find them for itself.<p>I highly recommend trying out Coq if this kind of stuff interests you. I recommend Coq over Agda/Idris because you&#x27;re going to be learning new syntax anyway and Coq has better literature out there:<p><pre><code>    http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/\n    http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/</code></pre>",1397483811

Many games, older Unreals included, had a separation between &quot;code&quot; and &quot;scripting&quot;, where stuff like animations, weapon firing, etc. was written in scripts, in the belief that this would be easier to update as required vs. C or C++ code.<p>Doom 3 and previous Unreal engines had scripting languages; even the first moddable FPS engine, Quake, had a &#x27;scripting language&#x27; of sorts -- Quake C, a sort of subset of C. id software turned back to pure code with the Quake 4 engine, however, recognizing the mistake that introducing the overhead of script-vs-code, and the limitations of scripts, outweighs any gains from being &quot;easier to edit&quot;.",1397483753

For example, bind parameters for databases, or proper escaping functions.<p>If you think about it as sanitizing input it means you tend to misplace your attention to detail and only consider the entry to your application.  A single input is often used to do multiple things through a program so you cannot properly handle sanitization at input.<p>The real push should be for proper output encoding, not input sanitization.",1397483752

I&#x27;m not sure how the walled gardens fit into my story/observation. I don&#x27;t like  walled gardens, but I think it is tangental. I mean it in the context of a person buying a gadget (ipods and/or ipads make a good example)<p>The other hardware companies will tweak a product to be have the biggest screen, RAM or HDD (whatever feature retailers are highlighting ) at some price-point and they&#x27;ll do it at the expense of the battery  or some feature shoppers are not looking at as closely right now. They&#x27;ll create a product just tailored to buying managers&#x27; checklists. Apple don&#x27;t do this. They won&#x27;t compete on price or checklist features.<p>I don&#x27;t want to idealize them too much, but I think Apple do a lot less of the above than most. They generally win by making some something people will want enough to pay for with their own money at a price that gives Apple their fat profit margin. Sometimes it&#x27;s by &quot;inventing&quot; a category like the last big string of big wins.  But, for a long time people have been buying Apple laptops at a premium price. No major category invention just consistently good quality of software and hardware.<p>I hope I&#x27;m not drinking kool-aid. I&#x27;m not even mush of an Apple consumer (more of a windows avoider) but I think they do keep and artistic integrity like a Jazz band that chooses not to make a trendy pop record. Mot people prefer (by definition) poppier music. But, from a certain perspective there is a greeter victory in making a popular Jazz song than a popular pop song, if you&#x27;re a jazz band.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the optimal strategy for being successful (though it obviously serves Apple) but I think that&#x27;s the kind of competition that improves a market.<p>Back to FF. I really appreciate them. They won by being awesome and making using the web better. Faster, prettier. They had tabs. They had awesome plugins like firebug that helped developers and helped a lot of non developers understand how the web worked.  They had lots of plugins that showed people they could customize their web experience. They proved that OSS could be awesome for users.<p>My perspective is that of a fan.  From that perspective, I&#x27;d like to see FF succeed or fail by trying to be the best browser. If that conflicts with being a more popular browser or more profitable one, I&#x27;d like them to choose &quot;best browser.&quot; If they are handicapped because Chrome has better access to users, I still want them to compete on being the best. I would rather see them die trying then surviving because they figured out a way to get more ad revenue at the expense of user experience. That&#x27;s obviously different to the investor/owner/employee perspective.<p>As for support, I don&#x27;t think they can raise the kind of money from donations they can make in advertising.

7585999,comment,7585403,7585403,7,0,Zigurd,,,"Software projects and project management tools have always been a dangerous combination. Project management tools were originally made for creating big, expensive physical objects. These projects merited hiring professional project managers, and the nature of the projects left little room for ambiguity: Either 27 floors of steel are up, or not. In this world every measurement of task completion is represented by a physical object.<p>Contrast this with software development: If you use the same tools as people who build skyscrapers, you are locked-in to a largely &quot;waterfall&quot; model of development. That&#x27;s way out of fashion for good reason. The plan is rigid and subject to misreported completion. Projects die with 80% of every task complete but with few of them actually finished, done, put to bed.<p>But if you use &quot;swim lane&quot; style tools, the plan&#x27;s malleability is an invitation to make frequent changes.<p>The best I have been able to come up with is:<p>1. Use a traditional resource-loaded CPM chart to find places where the project is resource bound, find milestones that can be used to funnel multiple task completions to a choke point that must be completed before subsequent tasks are started, and get a best-estimate for total project completion. This is for planning only, not tracking.<p>2. Use a &quot;swim lane&quot; style task manager to run tactical resource allocation and keep decisions about resources fluid enough to not be bound to a rigid waterfall process.<p>3. Keep a versioned spreadsheet (Google Sheets is ideal for this) that tracks added and (ha!) deleted tasks and their resource and time estimates.<p>4. Use milestones as gates that must be crossed before earlier parts of the project can be confirmed as completed. If the milestone is not complete, the project is in a state of day-for-day slippage.<p>This keeps a project nimble, not to say &quot;agile,&quot; it provides adequate discipline before you find yourself at the end of the project schedule and are surprised it didn&#x27;t all come together in the last week, and it gives me the documentation needed to take to a client when change requests add up and a re-estimation is needed.",1397482311

I&#x27;m not sure of the structure they have over in the UK but I&#x27;m quite sure it&#x27;s the same type of thing, considering that land over there is much more valuable.<p>Here in the US you&#x27;ll find a vast majority of the land used for self-storage is owned by either investment firms specializing in commercial/self-storage real estate, MLP&#x27;s (Master Limited Partnerships), or REIT&#x27;s (Real Estate Investment Trusts). There are a lot of nuances to it, but essentially these are tax vehicles that buy up a bunch of not particularly sexy land, but in an industrious location that has long term potential. The issue then becomes what to do with the land while you sit on it, and the answer to that is self-storage. Self-storage warehouses are incredibly cheap to build and operate, often times the largest cost is insurance (although that&#x27;s not saying much nowadays). Many MLP&#x27;s/REIT&#x27;s either own their own self-storage company, own a controlling share in one, or at least own a good percentage of one, or the self-storage company in and of itself is an investment firm wrapped in a thin veneer of self-storage. Thus, on top of the rent you can get a nice cut of the storage profits. It&#x27;s a fantastic racket if you can get momentum, after a certain point the money essentially prints itself and you still have control of a massive chunk of land to boot. The self-storage business is also very predictable, and highly tuned, so the investment returns on both the land and the storage business are very conducive to long term wealth building.",1397481741

When designing a scheme, whether a low-level cipher or a higher-level protocol, only a small fraction of the time is spent on the initial design itself. That is not to say that a scheme is designed and promptly finalized; analysis results feed back into the design process, of course. But the analysis is generally by far the most time-consuming task.<p>Additionally, sane people do not use building blocks that they don&#x27;t trust. If you need a block cipher you use AES (which is partially backed by security proofs) instead of designing your own (unless you have very specific requirements). This saves immense time in both design and analysis. Same with modes (Feistel structure, Sponges, HMAC, etc). Proofs play a big role here, although it is important to understand what they say, instead of blindingly assume they mean whatever you use them for is secure.<p>You are right that implementation is generally left as an afterthought.

If there is no need for braking, just lateral grip which isn&#x27;t going to be much on a poor snowy road, anyhow. \nThe rear tires have to work doubly as hard in this scenario as well - they have to maintain lateral grip while accelerating (or simply putting power down enough to maintain speed).<p>A true AWD (or 4x4) would be able to use the acceleration and lateral grip, meaning, the tire can be accelerating and turning.  This takes the load off the rear wheels for putting down engine power. Thus, to move at the same speed, the rear tires only have to use much less of their available grip for acceleration and can concentrate on lateral grip (not fishtailing/oversteer situation as above RWD would).

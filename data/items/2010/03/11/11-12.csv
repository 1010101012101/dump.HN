For these reasons, I think University is more valuable than the paper you get at the end.",1268308759

Reading lots and lots will not make you a better speaker.<p>My advice would be, if you want to become a better speaker, to seek out English-language programming available internationally (sadly, that may limit you to CNN International, but better than nothing), and focus on things like intonation, and the flow of discussion. Two things you won't learn from reading articles.<p>Of course, the alternative is to spend 20+ years in an English-speaking country, then you'll probably have better pronunciation and diction ;)",1268308589

That price is usually pretty low (good for the angel, bad for the entrepreneur), often lower than what it would've been if you'd just priced the angel round from the start.  This is because in this situation the assumption is that you've tried to raise money from VCs and failed, implying the company has some problems that will prevent it from scaling.<p>In other words, if you seriously don't think you'll need to raise from institutional VCs, the standard convertible debt terms aren't for you.",1268308254

I know you have alt-text there, but it just seems an odd thing to do now-a-days. Also, when I send links to people to recommend they have a look, I often copy-paste the blurb to explain it. I can't do that easily with this.<p>- Soundkey is too new a concept to just add it to a design as ""soundkey: XXXXX"" - not everyone is curious enough to find out what a soundkey is.\nEncourage users or designers to place it closer to the difficult words.\nA hint would make it clear that help is available ""How to pronounce my name: go to soundkey.com/XXXXX"" - in other words, promote the help first, and soundkey second.\nOver time, I see this has the potential to become a generic (as in hoover)<p>- Provide an easy to copy link, much like how URL shorteners present you with the entire link to copy. Currently, I have to see the key, remember or copy it, browse to your site, then enter it (...into the <i>little</i> box at the top right of soundkey)\nWhat I'd prefer to do is copy and paste the URI that takes me straight to that soundkey. Every thought, click, key press makes people a step less likely to use Soundkey.<p>- I'd swap positions of ""Tell it like it is"" and ""Soundkeys in action"" - the business card image tells me straight away what you do, without having to read the description. In fact, highlight the addition of the soundkey on the 2nd card. Just imagine that users are completely lazy - they don't want to read the text, they don't want to play 'spot the difference' between the two cards.<p>Honestly, great idea, and keep us posted on your progress.",1268308133

So, now, you need to define value.<p>I cannot think of any consistent definition of value, applied to the entire 'natural world,' that would make humans and trees worth the same.<p>And there is no reason that this value needs to be 'intrinsic.'

An acquaintance of mine, upon seeing my desk strewn with various wires and components, immediately asked ""Wow, are you making a bomb or something?"" - how crazy is that?

In other words, after you write the code, you spend at least as much time wondering what the system is actually doing, even if the code is nearly all correct.<p>Starting about three years ago, I started telling folks you not only had to write code that runs correctly, you also must provide some kind of support to see whether code is running correctly. Even if there are no bugs, some emergent effect at runtime will puzzle you, and a long time can be consumed by tracing the cause and effect back to appropriate roots. When you work on a team with several other folks, after the first agonizing bug shows up, you can spend a lot of time proving your part of the system does exactly what expected, and didn't play a role in the observed chaos.<p>Lately I seem to spend most of my time in forensic system analysis as a local coroner for other folks' code fatalities. I never had an ambition to be a code coroner.<p>It would be enormously helpful if a language -- and not just one particular development environment -- had explicit support for generating evidence of what and how a system actually got from one point to another.""",1242830750

618614,comment,618459,618568,0,0,splat,,,"One of the problems with present-day technology is that the capability of wiping out the human species is a possibility, even if vanishingly small.  It's hard to refute the argument that ""The value associated with the destruction of the human race is minus infinity, so the expected value of doing anything that has a nonzero probability of destroying the human race is also minus infinity.""<p>But we seem to be comfortable with this existential threat on some level given that we switched on the LHC and we have thousands of nukes ready to destroy every major city on the face of the earth within hours.<p>It all comes down to costs and benefits.  If we try to minimize this existential threat by building some sort of infrastructure so that biohackers can conduct their experiments with oversight we're going to lose something.  In this case, we'd be losing research that qualified scientists could be doing instead of babysitting people who, on average, probably have no idea what they're doing.<p>Plus, institutionalizing the process seems to me to defeat the purpose of biohacking--using unconventional techniques to solve problems.  In the facilities you describe, I'm not sure the biohackers would have the freedom to perform the experiments they want.  True, it would significantly reduce the odds of a catastrophic virus leaking to the general population, but it would also reduce the odds that someone discovers some ""miracle cure.""  (Of course, the odds of this happening either way are pretty small, but I'd reckon that the odds of something good coming out of these garage experiments is at least an order of magnitude greater than the odds of anything bad happening.)",1242830534

618583,comment,618295,618401,0,0,markessien,,,"I don't think that non-obvious and ""good developers"" should be joined together in one sentence. It's possible to do a lot of macro magic, it's possible to do a lot of function manipulation, but this is not good development. This is efficient development when you are working with projects or systems that require that sort of thing (maybe large dataset manipulation or embedded systems), but in my opinion, doing those things is bad programming.<p>The reason is simple: They are difficult to understand. Code is communication, and there are two listeners - and when you are pushing function pointers around using macros, the human is going to have huge problems understanding what you are trying to achieve.<p>So I don't think exploiting particular features of a language to extreme levels when it is unneccesary makes you a good programmer in that language - I actually think it makes you worse.<p>It's like writing a book - you have a certain vocabulary at your disposal, and you can say almost anything you want with that vocabulary. There are different levels of obscurity in the words you use you can reach - you gain in expressiveness, but you narrow your audience. When you write a book for molecular biologists, then the particular terms you use should not be the same as when you write a biology textbook.<p>That's why I think that one can be a good C programmer without going much deeper than the C subset commonly used in C++.<p>This is part of my general philosophy in programming - clarity, simplicity and structure first, efficiency second.

While he's not so concerned that these would be used directly in future promotion decisions, he does have some other concerns.<p>* He worries that the decision making process of the business could be short-circuited (perhaps only sub-consciously) to allow easier dismissal or acceptance of some suggestions or proposals based on the categorization of the person behind it, rather than on its own merits.<p>* Both of us having been raised in the households of psychologists are inclined to believe that personality inventories such as this are pseudoscientific.

After the 9-11 attacks, all the coverage coming from US media was very patriotic and in a sense very biased where the coverage coming from abroad was more critical and factual. Even if an article reports only facts, it can still be biased depending on which facts are reported or how the article is framed.<p>I would say that the main problems with journalism these days are the reliance on pundits, commentators, the public and partisan organizations instead of analysts, good journalists and factually based editorials.

The low-level details of C++ are mostly the same as C's, unless you want to write a shared library in C++ and thus need to extern the C++ symbols, or need to worry about the details of the object-system implementation like vtables, or need to mess with streams and layer them over some communication medium.<p>What makes C++ fucking hard is the syntax explosion that feels like cleaning up a New Year's Eve confetti with your bare sweaty hands, the template voodoo, and the design patterns that they have tacked on the language to make it more palatable to Satan.<p>To make it worse, the language is both broad and deep. You can't learn C++ by reading the standard. You have to dip into the culture of one of the big vendors, or schools of programming, to find out what subset of the language is to your liking. Are you writing Bjarne's C++ or GoF's or Alexandrescu's? or perhaps you would prefer to old HP/STL/Meyer C++ to the new kitchen-sink BOOST C++?<p>Contrast this to Common Lisp, which is a very broad but relatively shallow language; you can read the first few sections of every chapter of the manual and come off a good Lisper, go back and dig deeper and you only get better. OO, functional and procedural Lisp looks relatively the same. If you don't understand a construct, you look up the documentation of the symbol, see its evaluation model and presto. C++? You don't see what's being implemented because higher-level designs are being kludged and modeled with dickish, brittle and contrived tools -- they have no way out of this, as the language insists on C pseudo-similarity and refuses to adopt any kind of clean macro system; they're running out of syntax and CPP is unforgiving. Understanding C++ code then becomes a matter of psychological profiling of the author and even scholarly exegesis and deconstruction (""What did he intend to say?"", etc.) requiring a level of empathy hard to muster when you're, in fact, wishing ill and misfortune on the bastard who forced you to look at this mess.",1242828672

There are no single words that are more powerful or more significant than others - and all languages merely contain a collection of 'favoured words of a flavour', which as a whole don't really represent a greater or lesser degree of effort in regards to learning to use them.  The thesis is this: All words are equally difficult or hard to learn and use.<p>Thus the effort required to use Assembly is equal to the effort required to use C or Python, with more or less equal boundaries in terms of the number of words and terms you will learn for any particular language.  You can take two days to learn nothing but one language, and another two days to learn nothing but another language; the degree to which the progress of both of these periods is 'equal' is driven not by the words or language features themselves, but instead by <i>your personal interest</i>.<p>The average assembly programmer has to construct a taxonomy as equal in terms of effort as that of a Python programmer.<p>Now, bare with me here, because while I truly believe that 'all languages are flat', it is also a 'truism' that ""personal interest drives the peaks in the effort curve"".<p>That is to say, if you're not interested in Assembly, but you are interested in Python, it is your interest - not language features - that will be what drives the peaks and shallows in terms of the 'effort graph' in learning either Python or Assembly.  This is not a function of the <i>language</i>, but instead of personal interest.  I don't believe there are, for example ""stupid people who can never learn Assembly and therefore must learn Python while there are 'more intelligent' people who easily become more proficient in Assembly"" .. instead it is: ""this person could learn either language, but their personal interest inclines them towards one over the other"".<p>All languages are equal.

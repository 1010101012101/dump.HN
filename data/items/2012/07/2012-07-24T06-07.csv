This contrasts with programming where you simply usefully can't work on many problems unless you're in good enough shape to keep the necessary state in your head.<p>And an incidental note about your dad.  Driving involves a lot of complex visual recognition and situational awareness of a constantly changing environment.

4284634,comment,4283878,4284243,2,0,zalew,,,"If I undestood well what you are trying to say, your comment about jquery and css is a bit worrying, because it implies you think jquery is a visual effects library, while it's much more than that and by avoiding it you are probably just missing the point of using it. DOM manipulation fax exceeds stuff that is considered a cool effect you can replicate with css3. Maybe you just worded it badly, but even if, it still doesn't look good.<p>The above can be one reason why you probably missed <i>some</i> internships, but nothing is lost. If you want to progress you should refocus a bit on acquiring more general knowledge about, well, how sausage is made, and from there take a path towards the stuff you really want to do. I'm not implying you don't know any of this, just saying that ""My strongest suits are CSS3, HTML, JS"" isn't a great selling point for a hire, and from my personal experience with people I had to work with on projects, coders that market themselves as 'html/css guys' aren't really that great at actually helping me build websites. Why, you ask? Because working strictly on decorating front-end doesn't give you the experience of how products are developped in the long term, and it really narrows your point of view on about what you should expect to happen in the process (I'd have some horror stories to share, but that's not the point right now). Second, if I asked you why you used mongo or redis, and why you don't know sql, would you know how to answer so I don't think you just grabbed the latest tech of the week popularity contest winner? Maybe you would, but you should get my point by now - your description of the stuff you can do is weak.<p>You will have more success when you'll be able to convince with certain truthfulness that you know the basics of how web software works, how certain technologies interact with each other, that you have experience with tools, and that you'll be a helpful pair of hands willing to learn and not an obstacle - selling as a css magician just doesn't do that. To get experience, you probably need that awesome internship, but to get that internship, you have to convince your employee that you have done your homework.<p>Before you are a rails-sinatra-ruby-mongo-redis-jquery programmer who prefers tech A over tech B because X and Y, you are a programmer. Are you? If yes, tell it. If not, start working on being one.<p>> My current internship is working exclusively with these<p>Tell them you'd like to expand your experience.

We utilize this model in most of our international operations as it conforms with the local market practice. Using this payment model, merchant partners are not paid until the customer redeems the Groupon that has been purchased. If a customer does not redeem the Groupon under this payment model, we retain all of the gross billings for the Groupon purchase. The redemption model generally improves our overall cash flow because we do not pay our merchant partners until the customer redeems the Groupon.<p>> Fixed payment model - Under our fixed merchant partner payment model, we pay our merchant partners in installments over a period of generally sixty days",1343112876

But the reason could be the level of pressure and the anxiety involved.<p>On manual jobs I can work more than 8 hours a day with a good productivity and without feeling tired. In software development I can't. Probably this depends on the pressure. If you are in a manual jobs with higher productivity pressure (like assemble <n> units a day where the average is less than that) will have a similar effect.<p>Also I find a difference between people who have an expertise in a more specific software development field (SQL databases) than on people who jump to different problems/languages/technologies in different computer fields all the time.

<i>I dont currently have an app in the Mac App Store, so its hard for me to estimate sales, but Id bet the Mac version isnt generating much more revenue, even at the higher $9.99 price point.</i><p>I do. You really can't take iOS App Store sales trends and extrapolate them to the Mac App Store, the markets are quite different.<p>1. Sparrow is first and foremost a Mac app, and its target demographic is (or was) Mac users. The iOS version is supplementary. Without the ability to do push on iOS they wouldn't have been able to deliver as great of a user experience on iOS anyway. I would bet that the vast majority of their sales actually come from the Mac version.<p>2. Mac apps don't drop out of visibility nearly as quickly as they do on the iOS App Store. Part of this is because it takes a LOT more effort to produce a quality Mac app compared to an iOS app.<p>3. The Mac version of Sparrow has been pretty consistently in the Top 50 Grossing on the Mac App Store since launch[1]. I would be surprised if they weren't averaging at least $1000-1500/day on sales of the Mac app alone, with <i>much higher</i> spikes when they hit the Top 10 Grossing.<p>That said, I will agree that whatever they were making was probably not sustainable for a team of 5, especially compared to the $25M that Google was offering.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.appannie.com/app/mac/sparrow/ranking/history/#view=grossing-ranks&start_date=2011-01-01&end_date=2012-07-20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appannie.com/app/mac/sparrow/ranking/history/#vie...</a>",1343112023

And I think almost everyone wants to see endangered species protected. Yet I can't help but feel there is something quite pretentious about all this. We sit here cheering on the destruction of these traps, when in all likely-hood there are people who depend on them for sustenance. And really it's rather disingenuous to call the people setting these traps ""poachers"". Normally when you think of poachers you think of thuggish killers only in it for a profit. But even in this article, which to me appears quite biased, they admit that the traps are set by local bush-meat hunters. What they do might technically be illegal (though those laws likely only exist because of Western pressure), but to them it's just a way of life. I know Diane Fossey had trouble with the locals when she first showed up and started dismantling traps. I seem to remember from an Adam Curtis documentary that they even killed a couple gorillas just to spite her. But I don't think they have a complete disregard for the natural world that surrounds them. They just hold their own survival/advancement in higher regard. And who are we to really judge that, given that most Western affluence came at the expense of vast ecological destruction.<p>And imagine what it must be like for these people to see some foreigners come in and spend tons of money and energy on saving gorillas and basically treat you as the enemy. I'd probably be thinking, why the hell aren't they helping me instead, is my life worth less than a gorillas to them?<p>I don't have any great answers to all this. Like everything there is a lot of gray area to this story. But hopefully while we cheer on the survival of the gorillas, we should also spare a thought for the survival of the local humans as well.

4284555,comment,4284304,4284489,5,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"I actually agree, at least partially.<p>When I was young and in larval stage, I would work very, very long hours on my hobby projects.  Today, I think of myself as having a programmer's virtues of laziness, impatience, and hubris, I despise all-nighters (even for hobby projects), and I place a lot of value on leisure activities and time with friends and family.  My passions have changed, even though I like having the time to work on my hobby and business projects (I've got two at the moment).<p>But then again, my skill level has increased far more than my desired work hours have decreased.  When I started, I could barely use the Delphi graphical debugger, often dealt with null pointer errors from bad object-destruction or initialization practices, crashed my machine from copying data to the wrong location in memory half the time, reinvented the wheel most of the time, knew no math above high-school level (I was in middle school, after all!), knew only three similar imperative programming languages (QBasic, Delphi, and C++), and only knew how to use Windows ME.  ""Version control"" was not even in my personal vocabulary, and I only knew the build system that came with my IDE.<p><i>Today</i>, I know more programming languages than I can remember to list, I run all three major desktop OS's and program for them when desirable and necessary, I know enough calculus and linear algebra to make my way as a computer scientist and real programmer, either use garbage collection or practice strong memory discipline, almost never follow bad pointers, and do most of my debugging with System.err.println and command-line debuggers.  I have used git, Mercurial, Subversion, and CVS, the former two professionally, and I've had the misfortune to use not only CMake, ant, SBT, and Python install/packaging scripts for build systems but autotools and manually-written Makefiles as well.<p>My desired hours of work have shrunk linearly, but my skill, knowledge-base, and sheer experience have grown polynomially if not exponentially.  I don't just hit things with sticks anymore, I know <i>where</i> to hit things with sticks.  Just who the hell does the world think I am?<p><i>But all that said</i>, many employers most likely deal with a lot of larval-stage college grads and amateurs who remain <i>un</i>productive enough to require long working hours well into their careers.  There's also a <i>gigantic</i> signaling issue here, because not even 10 or 15 years in the field <i>actually</i> indicates that you're this kind of experienced, intuitive, get-it-done-quick-and-slope-off-down-the-pub hacker, nor that you're an ""A player"" for any specific field of problem.<p>So if I'm a hiring manager who wants to run a company full of lazy people (that is, ""lazy"" in the sense of short hours or even a reduced workweek), how do I find the programmers with the <i>sheer skill</i> to <i>not</i> require late-night debugging binges at least occasionally?",1343110312

850051,comment,848878,849725,0,0,wlievens,,,"A bug is a defect. A defect is a deviation from the intended meaning of the program. To automatically detect that, you will need a formal specification of the meaning of the program.<p>It's the automated programming paradox. You can't automate programming because you have to tell the automaton what to program... which is called programming.",1254214579

JWZ is a central point of control for DNA Lounge, I assume; PG is a close to a central point of control for YC news; Linus is a central point of control for Linux kernel enhancements</i><p>But the point is, JWZ is not a central point of control for all nightclubs, PG is not a central point of control for <i>my</i> startup, and Linus is not the central point of control for every Free operating system.<p>Apple controls devices that you own whether or not you want Apple to have that control.  If I want to pay a friend to write an application for me, I have to get Apple's permission.  This is a different kind of control than ""if I want pg to give me free money, I have to convince pg to do so"".  Apple is injecting itself between parties that do not want Apple in the middle.

Twitter meetups happen at least monthly, and there are also mobile tech meetups, social media meetups, The Hive for entrepreneurial talks and the like, and regular meetups for [programming language of your choice]. Sydney has a lot of similar things happening, but I'm not as familiar with the scene as I'm not there.<p>In terms of startup scenes we have a long way to go to match the US. Sydney and Melbourne have a friendly rivalry going -- Sydney likes to think they're more Silicon Valley-like, and Melbourne beg to differ ;) Both have good, albeit small, groups of enthusiastic hackers trying to create a tighter-knit startup culture.<p>This Melbourne meetup is one of the things we're doing here to try and bring everyone together and get more of a community happening.<p>One of the other things everyone mentions is how much harder it is to get VC funding in Aus, which is one of the reasons the startup culture is a little stifled.",1254214356

Then write an FFI for the one function and call it from $FAV_LANG. But only because I don't do shell pipes.",1254214240

But in the end, the guy we hired IS a frigtard. The only difference to Joels description is, that he usually comes with a cup of tea into my office, not coffee. But the focus on useless, time consuming, elaborate bs is remarkable.<p>Just a side remark. And my fault of course.",1254213757

It sometimes seems like the few staff members are pretty spread thin when it comes to actually taking bags.<p>On the other hand, I normally travel with only carry on bags.  There's often little to no line at the ""no baggage"" check ins, which makes it a much faster choice for getting through the airport.<p>Can anyone else confirm/deny these observations?",1254212413

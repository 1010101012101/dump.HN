229984,comment,229732,229732,0,0,ajross,,,"I think some of the meta-point might be a bit strained here.  It's true that there's a <i>lot</i> of bloated software out there.  And the example at the top, Acobat Reader, is one of the worst.  It's a dog, and really easy to improve on.  I've never heard of the ""Foxit"" product, but the poppler-based Evince reader on my Ubuntu box is similarly ""snappy"", even on huge documents (scanned-in D&D sourcebooks, for example -- yes, I'm a geek) where Adobe really crawls.<p>That said, there's a ton of common GUI software out there that really does deliver a pretty quick UI experience.  Firefox 3 comes to mind as a good example here (especially given how hard it is to make some web content ""snappy"").  Likewise many of the smaller utilities on a modern Linux desktop are nice and quick.<p>Basically, the problem is real, but not as widespread as the article posits.  A quick and clean desktop experience on modern hardware is both possible and available if you're willing to look for it.<p>But yeah, Acrobat is awful.",1214589107

The insertion and other costs differ between the two as well, though. A hash table would be clearly best in a case where the approx. final table size needed is known ahead of time, most data is inserted upfront, and characteristics of the data are known (for tuning the hashing function).<p>Also, good point about string comparisons getting longer among close nodes.<p>Personally, I think skiplists are most interesting because they rely on randomness to make the underlying structure efficient.

In the new poll, about four out of five Americans (79%) correctly respond that the earth revolves around the sun, while 18% say it is the other way around. These results are comparable to those found in Germany when a similar question was asked there in 1996; in response to that poll, 74% of Germans gave the correct answer, while 16% thought the sun revolved around the earth, and 10% said they didn't know. When the question was asked in Great Britain that same year, 67% answered correctly, 19% answered incorrectly, and 14% didn't know.</i><p><a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/3742/New-Poll-Gauges-Americans-General-Knowledge-Levels.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/3742/New-Poll-Gauges-Americans-Ge...</a>",1214589030

I've wanted to write something like it ever since I held my first ""business"" role, as a product manager moving from a lead dev role.<p>I cannot possibly stress enough #11 on this list --- ""blow your own horn"". Software development is more meritocratic than almost anything else you can do in technology. Devs track each other by commits and by improvements to codebases. Some devs are loud, but even when they are, their seniority and expertise usually manifests itself in strong opinions, not outright bragging.<p>The business world does not operate this way. If you assume that people will notice and appreciate your accomplishments, you will get your lunch eaten. Worse still, if you call the classic geek play of being loud and authoritative as a way of expressing your accomplishments, without being explicit about why you're qualified to do that, you will alienate and offend people.<p>Here's a freebie from my list:<p>Don't write long email messages. Don't ever write documents in the form of email messages. Businesspeople use email differently than you do. They've never been on mailing lists. They never read Usenet. If you have something to say that needs to be remembered, put it in a Word document, ""brand"" the document (""The $XXX Plan""), and send that instead.

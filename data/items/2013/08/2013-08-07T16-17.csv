R is absolutely a real language in every sense of the term. R, and its precursor SPlus, both have a very lispy feel. If you should ever try scheme after learning R, the biggest superficial difference you&#x27;ll find is that the parentheses move:<p>function(x1, x2) becomes (function x1 x2)<p>R has a number of warts as a language (e.g. how it deals with copying objects in memory, amongst others), however it&#x27;s just as &quot;real&quot; as Python, which also has its warts.<p>I do like the direction Julia&#x27;s heading, even if I&#x27;d prefer to see something like Clojure/Incanter, or better still, something like Racket be the next baton holder.",1375894783

All I said was that corporations are not interested in the well being of the average person; which they&#x27;re not. The average person only matter so far as a potential source of income - and it&#x27;s been proven time and time again that you don&#x27;t need to respect your customers to earn their business (Sony are a great example of this - just look at the number of times they&#x27;ve screwed over their customers and yet how little impact it&#x27;s made on their business). This doesn&#x27;t make corporations &#x27;evil&#x27;, it just makes their priorities different (and anyone with even the slightest idea of how businesses work shouldn&#x27;t need to be told that the priority of a business differs from the priority of an individual)<p>Hence my point; that since the priority of businesses are not that of the people, businesses shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to influence law.<p>As for the government being &#x27;evil&#x27;, I&#x27;d probably say they&#x27;re more a mixture of business men making decisions that are most profitable for themselves (normally an acceptable trait, but in this instance we&#x27;re back at the conflict of interests argument) and the less intelligent officials who honestly believe anyone they don&#x27;t understand is a dangerous threat to the United States - so they go completely overboard in their mission to protect the nation against Linux system administrators, other religions and kids who post memes on social networks. Heaven forbid they ever meet an 18 year old social network addict Muslim who works as a sysadmin; I bet some officials would probably have a heart attack.",1375894631

As a hobby, I help friends buy/negotiate cars, so I&#x27;ve had experience with several dealerships. Here&#x27;s my list from memory:<p>Chrysler/Jeep/Dodge: Horrendous. I have never found a dealership I like in this chain.<p>Nissan: Hit or miss. One dealership was fantastic (San Diego) and one I went to was the awful &quot;hard sell&quot; place.<p>Mazda: Every one I&#x27;ve been to has been good save for one (unfortunately, that one is the closest to where I now live in Austin, TX.) If you live in Austin and want a Mazda, go to the dealership on the south side. They will literally throw you the keys and let you test-drive any of their cars.<p>Acura: Good overall, though have not been impressed with the salespeople themselves.<p>BMW/Mini, Lexus, Mercedes/Smart, Porsche: Have always had good experiences with these dealerships. One caveat: My fiance has a BMW and we bought it certified used, and it didn&#x27;t come with a manual. A year later, despite multiple requests, we still don&#x27;t have a manual. The sales experience was good, however.<p>Of all of the above, Lexus has been the most consistently awesome. I&#x27;ve been to 4 different dealerships and all were extremely pleasant.<p>Of note: Two dealerships have offered me jobs as a car saleswoman after I negotiated with them for friends.",1375894611

People lament the lack of JITing in UIWebView or that JS is inherently slow or whatever but if you&#x27;re targeting mobile, there&#x27;s usually only one thing that matters:<p>Can your JS rendering code consistently execute within 16ms?<p>JS (even without JIT) is certainly fast enough to do this if you offload anything intensive to workers (in fact, I recommend that you put your whole app except for the real time aspects in a worker if possible) and schedule long running tasks over several requestAnimationFrames.<p>Usually the only issue is that GC pauses can cause hiccups > 16ms and you&#x27;re in no control of that. This has traditionally been seen as a deal-breaker.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m excited about Asm.js (and LLJS) -- even on generic JS runtimes, it&#x27;s my understanding they don&#x27;t generate garbage, and can execute without GC pauses.

Just like when playing a rift game, you feel as though you&#x27;re physically present in the world, and it&#x27;s incredible. The thing they&#x27;re missing is the ability to move your head around in the video -- it&#x27;s a little bit disorienting to have to look where the recorder looked.<p>I&#x27;m aware of a few ways to marry traditional video entertainment and videogames with rift support (there may be more):<p>1 - 360 degree video with free head movement
2 - Extremely linear, story-driven games without cut-scenes
3 - Re-living movies or TV shows by being placed within them (a la in Ready Player One)<p>We&#x27;re very close to having 2, and 3 is very similar to that but it&#x27;s in the distance still. 1 is something we&#x27;re not really doing yet, but I think it&#x27;ll be a pretty big deal when it hits. Videogame replays and streaming are already a big deal, and they&#x27;re growing fast. Being placed within them and given the ability to look around will be <i>fantastic</i>.",1375894146

I&#x27;m sure there are quite a few people out there who  could really benefit from a short-range commuter, but never have a need to drive a car beyond the range of an electric car. For people like that, a Leaf would make perfect sense as their only car.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t do it, you wouldn&#x27;t do it, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that <i>nobody</i> would do it.<p>For people who do want to drive long distances, but not frequently, it could still be a good way to go. Cars are pretty easy to rent, whether from a place like Zipcar or a more traditional rental company like Enterprise. If you drive long distances rarely, it could easily be a win to buy something like a Leaf, then rent on the rare occasions you need more.<p>I find that people often try to imagine every possible eventuality when buying a car, and want to buy something that&#x27;s capable of it all, no matter how rare these things are required. Well, they say, this car is perfect for our daily needs, but when the sister and parents come to visit once every two years, they won&#x27;t fit, so we need something bigger.

    only guardian of true liberty.
  * Knowledge will forever govern ignorance, and a people 
    who mean to be their own governors, must arm 
    themselves with the power knowledge gives.
  * Learned institutions ought to be favorite objects with 
    every free people. They throw that light over the 
    public mind which is the best security against crafty 
    and dangerous encroachments on the public liberty.

Thomas Jefferson:<p><pre><code>  * Every government degenerates when trusted to the 
    rulers of the people alone. The people themselves, 
    therefore, are its only safe depositories. And to 
    render them safe, their minds must be improved to a 
    certain degree.
  * Above all things I hope the education of the common 
    people will be attended to ; convinced that on their 
    good sense we may rely with the most security for the 
    preservation of a due degree of liberty.
  * I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of 
    the society, but the people themselves: and if we 
    think them not enlightened enough to exercise their 
    controul with a wholsome discretion, the remedy is, 
    not to take it from them, but to inform their 
    discretion by education. this is the true corrective

The communications and deprecation of python-cloudfiles was poorly handled. The crux of what happened is that python-cloudfiles was a part time project and ultimately superseded by the python-swiftclient work in OpenStack.<p>We have requirements that for an SDK / tool to be officially supported, we have dedicated full time headcount to support and maintain the package(s) - the decision was made to proceed with Pyrax which leverages python-swiftclient and other openstack tools under the covers as the official Python SDK for Rackspace.<p>This was not made clear to the users, or the community by any parties involved, and for that I apologize. We&#x27;re continually working on better upstream communication/collaboration and this series of events (you&#x27;re not the first to give us this feedback) has made us take a very hard look internally on how this is all managed and communicated.<p>The good news is that Ed - our current Pyrax SDK maintainer is full time and dedicated to working with you and others on  pyrax - this means the Python 2.6 support will be taken care of.<p>Tangentially: Yes - python-novaclient and python-swiftclient from OpenStack will work on Rackspace Cloud - you can actually look at the Pyrax source to see that it uses these under the covers. Rackspace runs OpenStack with as few differences as possible so OpenStack tools should work great on Rackspace.<p>So, in short: I apologize.

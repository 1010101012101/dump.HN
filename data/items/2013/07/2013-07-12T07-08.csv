The combination of introducing new thought and speech crimes, while recording everything everybody says and writes, brings us squarely into an unchartered new era of despotism. No doubt this case figures prominently in the handful of statistics of &quot;prevented terrorism attacks&quot;, used to justify the NSA activities.
There is a danger here of a vicious downward spiral, whereby such cases are energetically pursued because they are interpreted as successes of the surveillance, used to boost the surveillance and thus to create even more such cases.",1373615940

I&#x27;m a web developer, and have only be doing it for about a year, so maybe I can&#x27;t even call myself a &quot;web developer&quot; with a straight face. Anyway, JavaScript was the first language I learned and what introduced me to the world of programming. As someone who wants to be able to rapid prototype and show friends the ideas I have, JavaScript is <i></i>perfect<i></i>. I remember when I was first introduced to jQuery, I was so excited to keep on learning more and more. The amount of flexibility JavaScript gives you to build flexible, dynamic websites is outstanding. JavaScript seems to be going through a renaissance right now in which frameworks pop up every other day to help you accomplish all kinds of tasks.<p>At the same time, I don&#x27;t think some developers give front-end engineers enough credit. Backbone and other similar MVCs can be very difficult to master, and I give credit to those who do. It&#x27;s serious, but very quickly rewarding, work.",1373615656

It&#x27;s great for grasping OOP concepts, algorithms, data structures, design patterns, and other problem-solving approaches that you can carry on to implement in other languages. I did some work in enterprise systems and Android during my first year.<p>Then I had to study Objective-C to make iOS apps, but I also picked up some things about C and I&#x27;m actually reading the K&R book now to know more. I think that C is a great language to learn after Java because it gives you an insight of what the Java syntax hides from you, but does anyway in the compiler level.<p>The thing now is that I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do next once I&#x27;m done with C.

There are multiple headers for IP packets; network equipment only needs to use the first of these (the IP header) for normal operation, but use of the second header (TCP, UDP etc.) is normally considered to be shallow packet inspection (usually called Stateful Packet Inspection) despite this definition.<p>There are multiple ways to acquire packets for deep packet inspection. Using port mirroring (sometimes called Span Port) is a very common way, as well as optical splitter.
Deep Packet Inspection (and filtering) enables advanced network management, user service, and security functions as well as internet data mining, eavesdropping, and internet censorship. Although DPI technology has been used for Internet management for many years, some advocates of net neutrality fear that the technology may be used anticompetitively or to reduce the openness of the Internet.<p>DPI is currently being used by the enterprise, service providers, and governments in a wide range of applications.</i><p><a href=""http://www.adax.com/products/dpi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adax.com/products/dpi.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.infonetics.com/pr/2013/2H12-Service-Provider-DPI-Products-Market-Highlights.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infonetics.com/pr/2013/2H12-Service-Provider-DPI-...</a><p>With DPI encrypted comms can be routed to storage, from there the encrypted data can be  sent to the supercomputers for further analysis.

Understanding something other people dont should allow you to gain an economic advantage somehow; there should be sort of arbitrage opportunities to profit from the knowledge differential. For example, many people think having a four-year college degree adds x amount of value because the average college graduate earns y more dollars over their lifetime than the average non-college graduate, and this means that everyone should go to college. But if you understand that a large part of x actually comes from the inherent value in being intelligent, and a large part of the reason students of top universities make better workers is that they were really smart even in high school, not necessarily because a university education is worth what students are paying, perhaps instead of hiring only from top universities, you can hire students straight out of high school based on their SAT scores (yes, the SAT measures intelligence) and train them yourself? Universities use a multitude of signals when deciding who to admit (test scores, essays, reference letters, extracurriculars), so in addition to trying to determine intelligence, theyre also trying to determine other character traits, but The Bell Curve (at least I think this is where I read it) presents some data related to job hiring that shows intelligence is the trait thats most measurable and provides the most predictive power.",1373612417

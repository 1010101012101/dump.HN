The less of either the people have, the less they want."" -- Charlotte Observer, 1897<p>There is very much a reason that it is the law that children must go to school until 16: we want to enforce a certain amount of education on them, otherwise they'll think they never need it.<p>The difference between me and my sister is a nice anecdote.  I love to learn; I read books out the wazoo, etc.  My sister, on the other hand, hates it.  For the longest time, my parents had to watch her do her homework, or she wouldn't do it.<p>The thing that eventually got my sister to do her homework by herself?  Getting it through her teenage head that if she reliably does her homework, my parents won't be on her case every 5 seconds.  She's now learning, not because of intrinsic love of it, but because of extrinsic reward: independence from my parents.",1195102779

Also, when I delete a message from the inbox, it doesn't actually delete the freakin message, it just removes it from the inbox. Arggggg.",1195102564

Yes, the clue to the puzzle is in the source code; I think that's where they were going with ""embedded"".

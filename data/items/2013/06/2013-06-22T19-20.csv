I think there have even been some published articles about various govt. agencies developing (or looking to develop) technology for this kind of manipulation.  I don&#x27;t have a citation handy, but if I can scare up one of the articles I think I&#x27;m remembering, I&#x27;ll post it.<p>Edit:  Here you go, they they definitely have the technology, but - as you might expect - they claim it isn&#x27;t used on Americans.

I understand the ramifications of the Fourteenth Amendment, and how the bill of rights was filtered through the 14th to see what still applied to &quot;subjects of congress&quot; (hint: only the 2nd amendment comes out unscathed due to DC v Heller). I&#x27;ve read (and used) the Canadian Ownership and Control Determination Act [1], and understand how it allows someone to actually own people (actual slavery). I&#x27;ve filed UCC-1 Liens against people and had sheriffs seize debtor&#x27;s property or put people in jail for not paying (debt slavery). These are not signs of a free society. these are signs of fascism and tyranny.<p>I hope you&#x27;ll forgive my worldview for being different than yours, but perhaps we can find some common ground: We both want to live in a free society.\nWe both want a populace to show courage.\nwe think it&#x27;s quite sad that people died in previous wars to give us the right to protest.\nWe both think the government has already won (the people are the government), and there&#x27;s nothing we can do about that.\nWe both think is necessary that people should continue to fight to keep things that way, with courage.<p>I bet we agree on many more things, actually.<p>[1] <a href=""http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-20/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-20/</a>",1371931105

5924932,comment,5923930,5923930,8,0,benjamincburns,,,"This annoys me. Articles like this co-opt a term (technical interviews) and redefine it against a subset of things that qualify as being that term (brainteaser/quiz heavy technical interviews).<p>There is simply no way to reliably hire skilled people without at least attempting to assess their skills. For technical people this means technical interviews. And an interview process that includes a trial project... is <i>still</i> a technical interview.<p>This is distracting from the real issue. Most companies are really bad at scaling their interview policies/processes. Quiz/Brainteaser interviews are born from an effort to standardize evaluations across multiple interviewers and multiple candidates. So rather than focusing on developing an interview process that&#x27;s focused on finding people that are a good fit, you&#x27;re focusing on developing an interview process that&#x27;s first easy for anyone on your side of the table to execute. Structure and process are good when they benefit the prior case, and stifling when they benefit the latter. In the end you wind up with a very expensive and completely repeatable noise generator that&#x27;s of no benefit to anyone.",1371930956

5924927,comment,5924706,5924798,1,0,georgemcbay,,,"Yes, this is feasible and Flash did this (optionally).<p>Flash supported this as a trade-off via the cacheAsBitmap attribute on elements.  Basically you&#x27;d set that to true if you knew the sprite was just going to be translated around in x/y and not scaled or rotated.  It wasn&#x27;t on as the default for new sprites because this mode would actually bite you in the ass if the sprite was going to scale/rotate nearly each frame because the cost of recreating the &quot;cached&quot; version would then be added to the render time without actually ever being useful.<p>So it is a good idea in practical usage to make this an optional feature, though I think Flash could have been smarter about it (like soft-default to caching and only override that once it sees a scale or rotate taking place).",1371930854

That does not mean widespread protests are a bad idea per se, but that if none of the protests actually have mass, they are going to be ignored by both officials and your fellow citizens as a temporary annoyance for which they will hold little sympathy.<p>This statement sounds a little defeatist and gives an excuse for not participating in demonstrations (since the required <i>massive</i> scale is likely not reached, one might be better of not going).<p>Actually demonstrations, even if they do not effect immediate change, will still have a number of positive outcomes. First, they will likely be reported on in the news (at least that would be the case in Germany), raising awareness. Second, demonstrators will meet like minded individuals with whom they can network and form strategies. Third, demonstrators will realize that they are not isolated and feel more empowered as a result. Last, it will at least remind the public and politicians that some people do care about this.<p>Is any of this enough to affect change? Likely not. But it is a first step and if we can&#x27;t even go demonstrate against this then we might as well stop caring. The possibility that demonstrations will not have the immediate effect we desire should not stop us.",1371930098

But if we can&#x27;t use legality to determine morality and morality in general is considered subjective then what are we supposed to do, flip a coin?<p>Obviously the answer is that we collectively have to define &quot;wrong&quot; based on logic, evidence and history. (The alternatives of basing it on &quot;might makes right&quot; or &quot;loudest voice wins&quot; may be popular but, at the risk of creating a cycle, that isn&#x27;t right.)<p>So we need to have a debate. We need to see the evidence. How many terrorists have been foiled with this surveillance? How many could have been caught some other way and what would that have required? What are the risks to the public of allowing the government to accumulate this information? How does the one weigh against the other?<p>The problem is that we can&#x27;t have the debate so long as they insist on keeping the evidence a secret.

They are content to have their communications slurped up because they can still send that email and make that phone call.<p>It&#x27;s not until they&#x27;re staring at a public fountain from which they are not able to drink because it has a stupid printed sign above it that says &quot;Whites Only&quot; that the public will accept that things have gone horribly wrong.<p>I think demonstrations would be excellent to see, but not if they&#x27;re anything like the Occupy movement, which the wider public opposed against their own self interest. It is very difficult to get the public&#x27;s attention when they do not <i>feel</i> the effects. The public is rather shitty at evaluating and appreciating things in the abstract. Demonstrations that are massive and concentrated would have a much more significant impact. Think of the Civil Rights March on Washington. That level of mass and concentration. Doubling it would be even better.<p>And yet, even that basic right to protest has been severely weakened by the fact that one must get a <i>permit</i> to protest in many of the locations that would be tactically good choices. This is madness. The 4th is not the only Amendment that the People have allowed to be weakened over the last two centuries.<p>Americans have become very lazy where protecting their rights are concerned, because the vast majority of Americans do not participate in protecting those rights when they are violated against minority factions.",1371928146

5924749,comment,5921005,5922492,3,0,rayiner,,,"I&#x27;m not pedantic because I think what is technically legal is more important than &quot;what nearly every person in this democratic republic holds&quot; to be true. I&#x27;m pedantic precisely because there is no such democratic consensus. The people don&#x27;t broadly believe what the NSA is doing is wrong. Your friends might think the way you do, but the vast majority of my friends are okay with what the government is doing, my parents are okay with it, my wife is okay with it. They are wary of the information being abused, but they stop short of thinking that the government cannot be trusted to have that information at all in its prosecution of terrorism. I&#x27;d have to go out of my way to personally find someone who strenuously objects to the NSA program, as it exists today.<p>So when you can&#x27;t resort to an appeal to the democratic consensus, you have to resort to pedantic legal arguments: the fact that the people don&#x27;t care doesn&#x27;t change what is and is not unconstitutional. And that brings you to an analysis of: what <i>is</i> the spirit of the 4th amendment, both in light of the text and in light of history? Was it intended to protect your house and home, or was it intended to be a broad protection of the amorphous concept of &quot;privacy&quot;?<p>The third way is by far the worse, but it&#x27;s the one you&#x27;re stuck with if you reject pedantic legalism. If the majority doesn&#x27;t agree with your viewpoint, and you can&#x27;t find clear support for your viewpoint in the text or history of the laws, you&#x27;re stuck arguing that your viewpoint should prevail based on an appeal to transcendent principles. And that puts you in the same boat as people who think the U.S. was founded as a &quot;Christian nation&quot; and that the Bible should inform our laws. That is to say, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you&#x27;re wrong, but rather that you&#x27;re fighting from weak ground. While viewpoints based on an appeal to transcendent principles do sometimes prevail, it&#x27;s almost always based on a hard-fought campaign to first establish a democratic consensus.",1371927789

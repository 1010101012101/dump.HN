5960305,comment,5958244,5959472,2,0,adventured,,,"America isn&#x27;t a Capitalist nation and hasn&#x27;t been for decades.<p>America is between a mixed economy and Socialism, with the world&#x27;s largest welfare system, and &#x27;social safety net.&#x27; 3/4 of the massive Federal budget goes to social welfare programs. From 1930 to perhaps the early 1980s, the US was a mixed economy.<p>Every aspect of the US economy is completely under regulation and Federal control. The number of Federal regulations has doubled since 1975. There are now over 170,000 pages of Federal regulations in total, governing every aspect of ... well, everything. Obama&#x27;s Administration alone added over 11,000 new regulations in just his first two years in office. America is the ultimate regulation state (aka the opposite of a low regulation free market).<p>America is heavily taxed, and has a total government system that eats 40% of the economy, and at $6.4 trillion is larger than the economy of Japan. Those facts alone disqualify the US as being Capitalistic.<p>It&#x27;s quite easy to demonstrate that America is in fact not Capitalistic any longer. A very short historical comparison of the economic structures (spending, taxes, welfare, regulations, etc) of the US economy in, say, 1820, 1890, 1910, 1930, 1975, 2013 - more than demonstrates the progression from highly unregulated Capitalism toward Socialism.<p>Capitalism requires an unregulated free market based economy. America is almost as far away from that as you can get before becoming a full blown Socialist nation. Even worse, America&#x27;s variation of Socialism is going to be Fascism, and is rapidly trending that direction.",1372453027

5960292,comment,5959496,5959496,1,0,anusinha,,,"This webpage by the FDA [1] is also a simple and easy resource about generic drugs.<p>The basic fact about generic drugs is that they have to contain the same active compound(s) and they have to match the bioavailability (active compound presence in the blood or other targeted region). If the generic drug fits this and is FDA-approved, then it can be sold.<p>The composition of a pill is complex. There is the active compound, but there are also many other compounds that are needed to make the pill into a discrete structural unit, instead of a fine white-ish powder, the native form of many organic molecules. See [2] for a common example. The composition of these ingredients can vary dramatically between the brand name drug and generics. I know somebody who is allergic to a number of generic drugs, but is fine with the brand name drug. This is presumably due to different fillers used to make the pill.<p>In some cases, the fillers used in the generic are very similar to those used in the brand-name drug. However, in many cases, they are different and it is incorrect to say that they are identical. However, in the majority of cases, it really does not matter, and Americans are probably wasting billions a year. But in some cases, buying the brand-name is necessary.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/understandinggenericdrugs/ucm167991.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusi...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannitol"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannitol</a><p>It is worth nothing that some cancer patients can become sensitized to Mannitol and become allergic to it.

5960269,comment,5959773,5959975,9,0,prospero,,,"CSP is message-oriented, Lamina is more stream-oriented.  One implication of this is that in Lamina multiple threads can traverse the stream topology without any contention, but in core.async this isn&#x27;t possible.  Another is that the topology is explicitly described in Lamina, but it&#x27;s implicit in core.async.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m not clear if any of these differences are important to most people&#x27;s use cases.  I suspect that Lamina channels can behave like a core.async channel without much trouble, so it wouldn&#x27;t bother me much if core.async became the primary interface for these sorts of things.

5960261,comment,5950428,5955949,1,0,VandyILL,,,"Thanks for the great input, especially the chargeback question. It seems like it should be at the top of the list but this is something I honestly didn&#x27;t think of (although I was aware of general potential for fraud I wasn&#x27;t dipping too heavily in the specifics).<p>I don&#x27;t see how the company would be able to establish credibility without having some sort of chargeback policy, but right now I haven&#x27;t done enough research to discuss a coherent and effective anti-fraud policy.  I think it would definitely be a large upfront cost or burden.  A shitty way to handle it off the top of my head would be to just issue more currency to reimburse people, but this makes the system as a whole look less credible and would also gradually weaken the currency.  It may just be a way of spreading the cost of a warranty over the population of users just like insurance, but at least doing it according to that method would be terrible PR / image.<p>For the merchant fee, I think it could actually be less.  Paypal/square etc. are just conduits to transmit standard currency from one institution to another.  In this case, since the currency is always transmitted via the same institution I believe the compan could charge less.  It wouldn&#x27;t have to make as much from an individual transaction because the company has a monopoly over all future transaction.  The exit fee on currency can also be though of as a deferred transaction fee - ie, if a company is breaking the currency out of it&#x27;s self contained loop, then they suffer a penalty fee.<p>The fees may add up, but hopefully less so than using something like paypal.  That being said it would probably be less than cash.<p>However, this is still more effective than directly investing in a pro-environment ETF because your committing your disposable income to the ETF & securing commitments from sellers etc. that they will continue committing the money to the ETF.  It&#x27;s utilizing a resource that you could not previously invest because you needed the liquidity/actual purchasing power to buy goods.  I think the bigger threat of high fees adding up is that if it trades at a discount then you aren&#x27;t using your money effectively.  But then again if a company does vary its price based on what currency you use & doesn&#x27;t accept it at face value then they are also expressing that they do not care about your values / participation in the system the currency is trying to fund.  -- Compare to Berkshare, a complementary currency in the US -- if a company required Berkshare customers to pay more than they would signal that they don&#x27;t really care about keeping wealth in the local economy.<p>Thanks for the resources, the legal issues are the area that I&#x27;m spending most of my time on, but nothing is simple in this area as that post says.  I looked through the posts but haven&#x27;t clicked on any of the links within the post you referenced.  It&#x27;d definitely on my to do list.  Now, I never planned on flagrantly ignoring laws, but sometimes because of the adversarial nature in this country you have to actually do something and cause a conflict before you get any interpretation on whether something is legal.  Regulatory agencies are supposed to be more proactive with guidance etc. but that&#x27;s not always the case.<p>Also, despite my own research I have not taken any bar exams yet and may even delay taking one based on where this idea is come November/December.  Thus I will definitely need to talk to some lawyers before advancing the idea.  Further, even if I was a licensed attorney already I would still likely seek outside advice.<p>Oddly, I&#x27;m actually working literally next to some financial crimes enforcement attorneys this summer but haven&#x27;t brought up any issues with them yet.  Didn&#x27;t occur to me until recently to talk to them about this idea.  Probably because I&#x27;m pretty confident they mostly focus on counterfitting.<p>By funding do you mean intitial funding or how the company is going to make money / sustain itself?<p>Originally I thought it would be possible to run the company based off a share of the gains from the investments, like a mutual fund management fee.  For various legal reasons this turned out to be fairly complex, but I&#x27;ve gone back to the drawing board and this idea may work.<p>In reality though the company would be funded primarily by the transaction fees although there is the potential for other sources of income but those are slightly farther down the road before they become viable & need at least some circulation of the currency to work.<p>For organization of the company I&#x27;m trying to figure out how the currency is supposed to function before I figure out how to structure the company to facilitate it.  Slightly chicken before the egg dillemma, but I think figuring out what the currency is supposed to accomplish and how it is supposed to function comes first.<p>I think one of the biggest concerns is that there may have to be a subsidiary in the company to split the finances.  Ie. there is one part of the company that handles all the money that can be recalled by the users -- the money that is invested in the ETF etcs.  The second part of the company would be the company that actually manages the exchanges & facilitation of everything.  This is similar to how Kiva is structured - they have a separate subsidiary that manages all the finances for their operations & keep all the money they manage for the loans compeletely separate, even if the money isn&#x27;t currently invested in the loan.  This dichotomy would likely be necessary for the company/currency to have any credibility.<p>If it goes the route of being something like just swapping equity in kiva-like microloans, then yeah, I see it as a nonprofit.  But realistically, if the company is going to develop products consumers actually want to use as a payment mechanism then the company will likely have to be a for profit company to keep up with other competitors in the bitcoin / traditional payment / traditional money transmitter space.<p>Unfortunately because of the regulatory issues it would likely need some funding from VCs in order to scale.  That in addition to actually setting up the trading account / system etc may need some funding just for other financial actors to take it seriously.  That being said a way to scale this idea without a lot of funding may be to just start it as a &quot;amazon coins&quot; type deal for a small group of participating environmentally friendly / socially responsible companies.  Meanwhile instead of any of the pariticpating companies holding onto the deposits in the &quot;coins&quot;/gift card the desposits just remain with an environmentally friendly bank.  I assume the regulatory path in addition to the expected costs could be estimated by looking at the initial steps Greendot went through when establishing there payment systems, but have a restriction on parcipating merchants.  Of course at some point the company would diverge from this path as it starts to switch from a closed circuit glorified credit card into a currency that any merchant can opt to accept.<p>Also, I think there is room for profits to pitch to VCs.  The payment space has tons of competitors and is a huge market.  However in the financial world there&#x27;s a lot of protest / disatisfaction but few real world alternatives (it&#x27;s just a matter of how/who you pitch it to - ie. an environmentalist, someone who hates fiat currency, someone who hates the idea that their purchasing power is tied to the economy as a whole & wants to opt out & have his money tied to a specific sector that thinks long term... & so on).  The potential market for this is anyone that bitches about the economy or politics but still wants to spend money.<p>As for the demo/prototype I agree.  Over the next 6 months with my limited coding skills I could probably built a crappy mock app that really just looks a little like a starbucks payment app, but wouldn&#x27;t survive a second in the real world.  It would absolutely suck in comparison to every other app on the market & wouldn&#x27;t really sell the idea because the whole idea is how the money is managed on the other side of the app.<p>There are API&#x27;s from Ameritrade & other brokers that could facilitate all the trading the company needs to do, but chances are they wouldn&#x27;t sign off on letting someone work off their system just to build a mvp to pitch to investors.  They&#x27;d probably want more credibility / financie behind it.  Could also just lie about what I want to use the account / API for, but that&#x27;s just something I&#x27;m not willing to do & burns too many important bridges & is just plain stupid.  Plus with credibility / trust being such an important element to this it would be an even more moronic way to start.<p>Thanks again for continuing this discussion.",1372452325

Surely you can understand why basing opinions and worldviews on pure anecdote is problematic, yes?<p>>>None of us are equal in any way, and none of us ever will be. You might as well decry the fact that some people are taller, or have an eye color that you prefer, or keep a head full of hair into old age. In a just (my definition of that word, not necessarily yours) society, we are equal in one respect alone: equal before the law.<p>Nobody argues that everyone is equal in terms of physical and personal characteristics. What is important however is for everyone to have equal <i>opportunity</i>. If you come from a well-off family who pays for your college, you are an order of magnitude better off than someone who had to take student loans. While you were studying for your classes and partying (or otherwise networking) in your spare time, they were working several minimum wage jobs. Similarly, after college, your job prospects will be better, not only because of higher grades (due to having had more time to study) but also parental connections, which may have landed you internships during summer breaks or full-time jobs after graduation.<p>If we move beyond anecdotes and look at the data, we see that it supports my argument. Do a Google search for social mobility in the USA and you will see that those who come from poor families are much less likely to proceed to middle class or higher throughout their lifetime. This is not because they are shorter or dumber or start balding at an early age, but because they did not have the same opportunities and therefore could not make as big of a jump as people who had better means.",1372451180

Flying was new and sexy and constantly changing. And you didn&#x27;t need to be a &quot;professional pilot&quot; to get in on it; all you needed to do was to find someone with a plane and convince him to let you take the stick.<p>So kids who fell in love with the romance of the skies would hang around their local airfield, running errands and doing odd jobs, basically whatever it took to ingratiate themselves with the people who used it. Because any of those people could be their gateway to their own flying career.<p>Eventually flying stopped being sexy, though. The seemingly infinite possibilities of the early days of flight got reined in by cost and regulations and simple physics. Educational and career paths for pilots settled into a few profitable grooves. Flying became safe, cheap, routine. And the airport kids disappeared.<p>They disappeared because <i>kids want to be where the action is.</i> And the action isn&#x27;t in mature industries. It&#x27;s in the new, because the old is already hemmed in with grown-ups&#x27; restrictions, which slow down the pace of change. Those restrictions are usually put in place for good reasons -- lots of inexperienced pilots back in ye olden days got themselves killed by pushing their machines or their bodies too hard -- but the kids don&#x27;t see that. All they see is that it&#x27;s safe, which means it&#x27;s boring.<p>You and I (I&#x27;m a couple years older than you, but not much) were the airport kids of the Web. We gravitated to it because it was, as you say, a blank slate. You didn&#x27;t need a degree or a certification or to even necessarily know what the hell you were doing. All you needed to do was find a computer lab somewhere that was hooked up to the Internet, and be willing to learn.<p>That low barrier to entry meant that we made a lot of dumb, pointless, sometimes even dangerous things. (I came within an inch of getting drummed out of my university in the mid-90s for helping build a site where students could rate their professors; the professors came after me with torches and pitchforks because the results were accessible outside the campus network.) But it&#x27;s also what made it exciting. Exciting places are dangerous by definition. But to a kid, the part about it being exciting is a lot more interesting than the part about it being dangerous.<p>Eventually the Web matured, of course. Now it&#x27;s Critical Infrastructure, which means it&#x27;s important enough to be hemmed in with those grown-up rules and regulations. It became indispensible, and therefore boring.<p>So now there are lots of online-technology majors, but not so many airport kids. The airport kids are somewhere else, waiting for the next Wild West.

The activation object of a function contains all the variables that the function has access to, and it is part of a functions scope chain.<p>This means the inner function (the closure) has access (a reference) to the outer functions scope chain, including the global object. And even after the outer function has returned, the closure still has access to the outer functions variables.<p>Therefore, the activation object of the outer function cannot be destroyed (for garbage collection) after it has returned, because the closure still references its variables.<p>When the outer function returns, its own scope chain for execution (its execution object) is destroyed, but its activation object is still referenced by the closure, so its variables will not be destroyed until the closure is destroyed.<p>The execution context of a function is associated with the functions activation object, but while the execution object is used for its own execution and is destroyed when it returns, its activation object is referenced by closuresits inner functions. <p>Now, as to the specific example in question:\nThe reason the str variable is never destroyed is because it is referenced buy the logIt function because the logIt function&#x27;s execution object references the entire scope chain of the run function, and the logIt function is never destroyed, so the str variable remains in memory.<p>As the original author (OP) suggested, be sure to dereference any local variable in the outer function that the closure is using, once the closure is done with it or once the outer function is done with it.<p>Also, simply setting the logIt function to null (when it completes executionreturns) will allow the str variable and the entire scope of chain of both the logIt and the containing run function to be destroyed and ready for garbage collection.<p>For a detailed explanation of closures in JavaScript, see &quot;Understand JavaScript Closures With Ease&quot;:\n<a href=""http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-closures-with-ease/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-closures-w...</a>",1372450422

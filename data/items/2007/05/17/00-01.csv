If implemented correctly, it might not even take much time.<p>The majority of applications were probably rejected for the same few reasons: talent, quality of app, quality of demo, hard to monetize, lack potential market, etc.  Only in a minority of cases would YC have to actually write a sentence explaining why the app was rejected.

22639,comment,22629,22629,0,0,whacked_new,,,"There seemed to be a big disappointment because of the spamming. The spamming resulted from the big hype, so reasonably it will subside after the initial phase and there will probably be more interesting things coming out of the site.<p>In conjunction, look at justin.tv. The hype has subsided and how is it doing now? I can't say, not the target market, never paid attention. Similarly I'm not in the target market for Truemors, but comparing these two I would say that justin.tv's interestingness correlates to the hype and for Truemors the opposite.<p>So Guy has a point, and the critics who jumped quickly to deride the thing probably have too short of attention spans, or write to appeal to audiences with short attention spans.<p>ok enough whacked lameness from me over the past howevermany hours.",1179361794

I mean, we've hit the limit on speed for CPU until some magical graphite stuff comes out, so we've moved to multiple cores. Multiple cores are great for programs that can utilize them, but as I understand it, it's generally considered difficult to write truly parallel code in a language like C or C++.<p>(source, my crazy Comp Systems & Organizations teacher, plus it kinda makes sense). I suppose it doesn't answer your question about ""super parallelable"" but I would assume that any compiler that generates code for simultaneous execution based on a language that lets you write such code would simply be adapted to the new ""super parallel"" level.<p>The problem comes down to the fact that you can just throw a regular program at a compiler and expect it to magically become parallelized.",1272365912

It's not.  The human brain has 100 billion neurons, and 100 trillion synapses (wikipedia) - but it is the connections between them that make it do what it does. The possible connections are just mind boggling.  Let's say you build hardware with those numbers (utterly non-trivial) - how does it connect together?  How to we get it to structure in a way that those networks do anything?  You can't expect it to wire itself into anything useful.<p>We have no idea how the brain does anything of significance (merging of senses into a coherent whole; memory; consciousness etc).  We can't even define consciousness let alone understand how it comes about. We can't 'program' a neural network of any complexity.  Even things that we take utterly for granted like object recognition is immensely complicated, let alone things that we know are 'difficult' like sentience.  We can't expect this stuff to magically appear from a large neural network; nor can we program it (as we don't understand it); nor can we train it as we don't know what intermediate steps to train for.<p>Then, what are the inputs into it (and how are those interpreted by the hardware), and how do we get any output out of it?  Let's say you solve both the hardware and the wiring problem  - so you have a perfect replica human brain in a jar - how do you tell it what to do? How do you get any sense out of it?<p>We're fumbling in the dark here.  To think those fumbles will achieve intelligence in any form in the foreseeable future is unfortunately fantasy.",1272365083

It ignores the hours of work per week, experience, danger, and a host of other factors.

All of this leads to a dangerous vicious cycle, which kills a lot of startups.<p>It seems to me that the lean startup promotes a mindset of marginal incrementalism and has failed to acknowledge some of the dangers of such a mindset. To be clear, I firmly believe that the benefits of the lean startup model and its recent popularity far outweigh the costs.

1297780,comment,1296892,1297214,0,0,cschwarm,,,"> The open question is why anyone would buy software for Linux.<p>Well, I'd be interested in one of the following apps: a desktop wiki, an email client, a contact management app, a feed reader, a music player, a scalable image editor, a layout app, a recording app, a guitar effect app, a GIT client, and probably some more.<p>Of course, for each of these, there's some free app somewhere. But each of these free ones have something I don't like.<p>I admit, my willingness-to-pay is quite low. That's partially due to some free apps being available. The better reason, however, is that installing proprietary apps sucks under Linux. I also fear, the regular distro updates will break apps I've payed for.<p>In other words: If there's a way to conveniently download an app from a store or homepage, and to get security and ""distro upgrade"" updates (maybe, by registering the app automatically with APT during installation), my willingness-to-pay would be quite a bit higher!<p>> The key differentiating factor for _most_ people who use it is that it's free (as in beer).<p>How do you know? Any empirical studies I'm not aware of? Or just the Biased Sample fallacy?<p>> It's hard to see how you can ask people to pay for software now in the hope that it will eventually be good.<p>Dunno.

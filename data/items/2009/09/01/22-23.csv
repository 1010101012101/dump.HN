The one tiny inconvenient fact in the whole whinefest which is the newspaper industry today is that those runaway news paper costs everyone complains about are mostly due to debt service and not to ""quality journalism."" The debt was used to: (i) acquisitions and/or (ii) pay the owners nice dividends.<p>See there used to be a business model where newspapers would simply make acquisitions until there is a single paper in each city and then hike up ad prices and make a lot of money. This does not work anymore, because with the internet you can never entirely capture an advertising market. So now the papers are stuck with the enourmous debt of acquisitions and without the monopoly profits they were expecting.<p>Big f-ing deal. They made an incorrect business decision and now they are suffering the consequences. I don't know why I should be worried about that.<p>If somebody is worried about journalism, someone should start a news website with none/little debt and they should be able to make enough money for quality journalism and a tidy profit. Advertising online is valuable and one can get good money for ads on sites people really like to read. One may argue that this is already happening today.",1251845966

The problem is that strictly online providers were able to provide comparable information in a more convenient medium years before anyone in newspapers saw the light.<p>Of course, that doesn't mean it's too late to embrace online as the medium of choice for journalism companies.",1251842620

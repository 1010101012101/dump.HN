8230549,comment,8227721,8229373,4,0,kasey_junk,,,"So I have several responses to that.<p>- Lots and lots of large systems are decomposed across different languages based on the advantages they have.  Some parts of the system may be extremely latency sensitive and therefore can&#x27;t afford GC based languages, other parts may need to interact with existing enterprise systems and therefore are best written in Java or the .NET stack.  A very common split is amongst quantitative developers who prefer languages like python vs other developers that prefer something else.  So basically yes, there are times that I&#x27;ve worked on systems that were designed from the ground up to use different languages (or should have been).  That said, of course you want to make sure you aren&#x27;t adding complexity for it&#x27;s own sake and a unified language is usually better.<p>- A very common use of service architectures is not green field development.  It is in migrating from legacy systems or augmenting them.  Lots of large web based systems were originally written as monoliths on the LAMP stack or as Perl/CGI.  As they grow it becomes obvious that scaling will require different technology choices, but it is almost always a mistake to do a full rewrite.  In those cases, language agnosticism can be a real boon as you can ramp up in languages that are more popular at the time of need (or in languages that allow you to attract good developers).",1409104550

He asked mathematicians for help hammering out details, but 1) everyone does this and 2) mathematical rigor and abstraction wasn&#x27;t nearly as well-established back then as it is now, and was difficult to grasp for many physicists and even mathematicians.

8230524,comment,8224684,8227515,1,0,kasey_junk,,,"So there are 2 major problems with that definition.<p>1) It&#x27;s factually untrue.  Currencies have both the value of their materials and the art imposed on them.  Now it is true, that the primary driver of their price is not that &quot;inherent&quot; value.  The primary driver of their price is that they work as stores for value, as a medium of exchange, and that they are fundamentally tied to the governance regime they are associated with.  But there are lots of commodities that have the same characteristics.  Gold&#x27;s price is much more dependent on people&#x27;s perception of it as a value store than on it&#x27;s usefulness as an input to industrial production or as an artistic element and energy credits are commodities existent only within the governance regime that created them.<p>2) Even if you don&#x27;t buy that loosened definition of commodity in general, in the context of an exchange currencies are universally considered commodities because they have several important characteristics 1) there are both spot & derivative markets for them 2) They are completely fungible, dollars made in Philly are identical to ones made in San Fran 3) It is easy (trivial even) to create standardized contracts around their delivery.",1409103883

8230513,comment,8226139,8230264,1,0,Chris_Newton,,,"I think it’s a stretch to call a tool like npm, which currently offers 90,000+ packages, a “small, bespoke, use-case-specific” solution. I’m also fairly sure most people publishing their code via npm’s index aren’t spending “thousands of hours” resolving conflicts with other packages by hand; certainly no-one is manually checking over 4 billion pairwise combinations of those packages to make sure they don’t conflict.<p>And yet npm remains a useful tool, and mostly it does what it should do: download a bunch of files and stick them somewhere on my disk. The same could be said for gem, pip, Bower, and no doubt many other similar tools. They just all do it a bit differently, which leads to a huge amount of duplicated effort for both the writers/maintainers and the users of these packages.<p>I’m not arguing for magic or for orders of magnitude more work to be done. I’m just arguing for the work that is mostly being done already to be co-ordinated and consolidated through standardisation. To some extent I’m also arguing for operating systems that include robust tools to navigate the modern software landscape as standard, mainly because installing things with tools like apt has an unfortunate way of assuming there should be one global copy of everything, which is frequently not the case for either development libraries or end user software on modern systems, and because if the OS doesn’t provide good universal package management tools then someone else will immediately invent new tools to fill the gaps and now we are back to having overlapping tools and redundancy again.",1409103659

Most smart peers of mine are fast thinkers and I&#x27;ll usually lose to them on puzzles and tricky math problems when it is a matter of speed, but then I&#x27;ll solve problems that these same people give up on and claim too difficult if I can sit in a quiet room with my fists on my head.<p>I have a suspicion that fast thinking involves a developed ability to filter out (quickly) what seem like dead end avenues -- so the fast thinker can hone in on the promising avenues and get to a local maxima solution faster. But for some problems -- especially ones that require very non-traditional paths to solutions -- this filter fails and prunes away avenues that actually lead to a solution to that &quot;impossible&quot; problem or global maxima solution.<p>I realized a long time ago the danger in pruning away the &quot;obvious&quot; dead ends, so I think my slow thinking comes from a refusal to categorize anything as a dead end until it is provably so -- because of a worry I&#x27;ll prune away the solution. A bunch of avenues will present and I&#x27;ll need to <i>consciously</i> sort through them. So my filter is slow and requires me to retreat to that quiet room to go sort through all the possibilities. But then I&#x27;ll come up with gold.<p>I have a <i>theory</i> that I&#x27;ll put out here... that slow and fast thinking are <i>developed</i> tendencies not innate qualities. In my experience most of the smart people I know <i>are</i> fast thinkers. Which makes sense if this is developed, because there&#x27;s an ego reward involved -- especially in our educational systems -- for developing that way. And the only reward for slow thinking is solving a hard problem, but as a kid in school, where&#x27;s the external reward in that? And how often is the opportunity for solving really hard problems given? Basically what I&#x27;m saying is that I&#x27;d like to see more slow thinkers in the world. (I&#x27;m not kidding.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.unmuseum.org/einstein.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unmuseum.org/einstein.htm</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/the-questioning-mind-newton-darwin-einstein/505"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/the-questioning-mind-n...</a>",1409102146

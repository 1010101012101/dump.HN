How would it even be possible for an employee to know that the founders have taken (and will continue to take) responsible steps with their funding rounds?<p>Part of the issue at question is whether it&#x27;s worth it for employees to bet on founders having done (and continuing to do) the right things with regards to investment. So when assessing the risk/reward of equity over cash, an employee now has to not only examine the marketability of a company&#x27;s product and sales, but also whether they can trust the founders, board, or whoever to be responsible with equity dilution and valuations.<p>Given the huge variety of unknowns (and <i>very</i> high risk of dilution or lack of a liquidity event), as a non-startup-employed observer I have to say I&#x27;m very confused as to why startup employees take effective pay cuts for stocks.",1450893343

That&#x27;s why things like ColorForth and APL exist; to a tiny fraction of people and problem sets they&#x27;re intuitive, to the rest obtuse.

It&#x27;s just that they need to do due diligence on par with or better than an investor to avoid getting taken advantage of.<p>I&#x27;ve turned down more startup jobs than I can count.  When I interview at a startup, I thoroughly research their market, their competitors, their product, and their business model.  I ask questions about how they came up with the idea, and how they know other people want it, and what questions they asked when they did their market research, and how the idea has evolved in response to new information.  How did the team meet?  What&#x27;s the company culture like, and what do they value?  I ask about financials - are they profitable?  What&#x27;s their runway?  What&#x27;s their revenue and revenue growth rate?  Is it recurring revenue or revenue for one-off contracts?  What&#x27;s their churn rate?  I ask about funding - who is their VC?  How many rounds have they taken, what&#x27;s the preference overhang, how many more do they anticipate taking?  (And then in my head, I&#x27;m running over the financials to see if this squares with their growth & revenue plans.)<p>If they&#x27;re cagey about this, I walk.  Some companies are, and that&#x27;s their right, and I&#x27;m not going to work for them.  Others are very impressed that I&#x27;m doing this level of due diligence, because it shows that I view my time there as an investment, and will invest the same level of diligence and effort into the job itself.<p>Equity compensation itself is not the problem.  Equity itself is great for employees - they have an information advantage over every other shareholder of the company (including the VCs), and if they&#x27;re an early hire, they can have a meaningful effect on the value of that equity.  But to take advantage of this, they need to do due diligence <i>as if they were an investor</i> - they are, after all, they&#x27;re investing their time, which is far more valuable than a VC&#x27;s money.  Equity is much more highly levered than salary - its value depends on how events play out, not just on what you&#x27;ve agreed beforehand - and so you should make sure you have enough information to make a reasonable guess at its value before accepting it.",1450893229

If your options agreement allows you to early exercise you can avoid all of the tax penalty and remove the golden handcuffs if you exercise immediately (before you have realized a gain) and file your 83-b with the IRS.  If it doesn&#x27;t allow early exercise you probably don&#x27;t want anything to do with it.<p>> I recommend joining young companies that are willing to pay you a lot of cash for your exceptional ability and experience (execution is critical at this stage across the entire company from engineering to sales) and maybe take it easy on the option grants.

Common shares are <i>not</i> worthless.  In general, just ask any founder who&#x27;s had a successful exit.  Founder shares (unless purchased along side financial investors for hard cash) are always common shares; if your straw man were correct, then there would be no wealthy founders.<p>2. Liquidation preference is a negotiated term which <i>does</i> have a rational basis for existing.  Whenever you&#x27;re putting in a larger proportion of the company&#x27;s cash than the ownership you&#x27;re buying, it is crucial to have protection against someone essentially liquidating the company for the cash.  Say investor X is putting in $8 into a company that has $2 in the bank, but X is only buying 10% of the company.  If the company is liquidated for that $10 tomorrow, X gets back $1 and the common stockholders get $9.  (There are other protections against a perverse liquidation incentive, too, but this is the economic one.)<p>3. The &quot;real protection&quot; from dilution is raising reasonable tranches of capital at a monotonically increasing series of valuations, which valuations actually correspond to a clearing price between bid and ask.  Three key items here: &quot;reasonable tranche,&quot; &quot;monotonically increasing,&quot; and &quot;clearing price.&quot;<p>a. Reasonable tranche: raise reasonable sized rounds, because huge rounds create weirdness (lopsided power, outsized compensatory &quot;asks&quot; by investors, etc.).<p>b. Monotonically increasing: needless to say, down rounds are the big dilution problems.  Sometimes they happen because life isn&#x27;t perfect and problems come up.  Sometimes they happen because the company screwed up and raised too much at too high a valuation previously.<p>c. Clearing price: if the company and investor actually agree on the &quot;true&quot; valuation then it&#x27;s easy.  If they still try to force a deal where the company wants a crazy &quot;optical&quot; valuation that the investor doesn&#x27;t really see, then you&#x27;ll get layering-on of sweeteners to make the effective valuation much much lower than the notional, but all kinds of terrible side effects may accrue.",1450892698

They will make their choice, but for the overwhelming majority of Africans the choice is not between being a hunter-gather society once again and destroying wildlife. That&#x27;s a fantasy.<p>There are much more important (and realistic) choices to make, such as how many children to have, how to beat corruption, how to skip some of the more polluting sorts of development models, how to finance modern infrastructure that enables a modern economy, not just one based purely and digging up commodities until boom turns to bust.<p>The way to avoid destruction of wildlife is to have to have good policies, good education, good infrastructure and modern industries like IT, telecoms, finance, pharma or entertainment.<p>In order to go back to hunter-gatherer societies, the first thing you&#x27;d have to do is kill 95% of the population.

It’s not granular enough,” says Ian Williams, chief of the CDC’s outbreak response and prevention branch. He notes that “traceability from the farm to the point of service” should be improved throughout the food industry. In recent years, the agency has been able to find the contaminated ingredients in fewer than half of all multistate outbreaks.<p>To me this suggests a very simple solution. Legislate that each ingredient parcel must come with an audit trail. Assign to each parcel a reference number - a UUID or hash - that can be used to trace back its entire life and history. The solution seems so obvious that there are probably significant obstacles against doing so that I am not aware of. If such a system is implemented, then the next time a contamination breaks out, the source can be quickly identified and eliminated, then apologies can be made, and business can resume as normal.<p>>> The spread of norovirus in Simi Valley and Boston was caused by breaches of protocol, Ells says<p>Eliminating contamination entirely is a highly desirable goal, but outbreaks will likely continue occur regardless of anti-contamination measures.

And the decade afterwards of getting $3,000/year that I could claim against my taxes.<p>The only reason I&#x27;m not still claiming my $3,000 a year is that we had some gains that could be offset by those losses in 2007 and 2008.

Legal risks abound if they mislead and existential risks abound if they demoralize the company. It would be especially problematic when the company has started the IPO process as Good had.<p>Then there is the greed factor that comes in on everyone&#x27;s part.

At that time, the origin server was hosted by Typhon in France. I remember that after having enabled CloudFlare, the latency was significantly increased. I haven&#x27;t kept the specific timings, but to give you an idea, the response time was like 100 ms without CloudFlare and 500 ms through CloudFlare.<p>That said, it was a long time ago and I can guess things have changed a lot since. So I did a new test today. The origin server is hosted by DigitalOcean in Amsterdam. The median response time from my machine is around 100 ms. After enabling CloudFlare, I cannot see a significant difference in response time. The median response time, and the distribution of response time, looks very similar.<p>I guess that during the last few years you have expanded your network and your connections with the major hosting providers (Amazon, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.). Maybe it explains the difference between today&#x27;s test and 3 years ago?<p>In general, is it useful and/or recommended to use CloudFlare in front a fully dynamic service, for example a HTTP-JSON API, with no static content (no images, no stylesheets, no scripts), and thus no need for the CDN feature?",1450891633

Landing a rocket without relying on atmosphere is valuable/important. Gluing those two things together is much less so - like being the first person to climb Everest <i>and</i> swim across the Channel.<p>Honestly the F9 landing isn&#x27;t much of a &quot;first&quot; - landing a rocket vertically has been done, and landing the main engines of an orbital launch vehicle so that they can be reused has also been done. What makes it exciting is a) the technical difficulty b) the potential for making things there&#x27;s actual commercial demand for (satellite launches) much cheaper - and in both those regards Blue Origin&#x27;s landing isn&#x27;t comparable.<p>I suspect the main region for the popularity is that SpaceX has done a lot of community engagement, webcasts and all the rest of it, while Blue Origin has done everything in secret. But I&#x27;m fine with that - if it encourages companies to be more open then that&#x27;s all for the good.",1450891091

Basically, spend the time learning from them and spending time understanding problems they have (not Dr Phil style of course, but everyday crap).  People hacking (for learning) in a sense.<p>But assuming you don&#x27;t need/like that then here are another few ideas:<p>1. Learn the basics of how to architect a small distributed system that is fault tolerant, resilient and reliable.  You can&#x27;t learn it all in 11 days, but man you can make a big dent and it is to me one of the most fun and challenging problems to solve.  And there is still so much to learn.  You can build and test little systems in AWS for nearly nothing using t2 instances.<p>2. Do as iqonik suggested, find a simple need some group of people have and solve it with an MVP and start marketing and playing with it.  If it goes nowhere but you solved an interesting problem for even a small group of people you will still feel good and have had some fun.<p>3. Write an Android app.  From the looks of it you haven&#x27;t done that but it seems basically up your overall skill set and something you could have fun with.

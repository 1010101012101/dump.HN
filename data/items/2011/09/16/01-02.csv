People vote on what they want to do and then companies could see the customer interest and fill the order.<p>He had a mechanism in place that would have a group buying percentage rating, and naturally lower profit per sale for the person filling the order.<p>The first thing I said to him was, customers don't know what they are buying... they are gambling that companies supply something good.<p>From a companies point of this is a great mechanism to drop stock that isn't selling... which for most people would be stock people don't want... I doubt there would be many $99 Touch Pads, and mostly as seen on TV products...<p>He refused to acknowledge his system could be abused in this manner I suggested and the customer experience could end up quite bad (received products below the quality they expected).<p>I asked for some sort of spec, or numbers, or anything around what he wanted and I was presented with ""I've told you everything, and you have the designs"". The designs where ball point pen sketches he left on a piece of paper we found in a cafe where we had our first meeting.<p>I got a tad concerned at this point and pushed him for some other questions around his funding and sales men.<p>No sales staff, and he was taking out a loan to develop the work. At this point I said I wasn't interested as I got concerned that when money didn't start rolling in I might not get paid.<p>He got really angry with me after I declined and I felt a wave of relief as I assume he would have been the sort of client who would never have been wrong, and would have probably tried some stupid law suit blaming me for bad business decisions.",1316138241

Even if you hate trademarks and have no intention of registering yourself, some other Johnny-come-lately could register a name you've worked hard to give meaning to and then deny you its use. Prior use is an even less effective defense with trademarks than with patents, and international trademark issues are too nightmarish to talk about.<p>Take it from someone who has actually had to change a project name after two years. You want a name that's pronouncable, barely memorable, but nothing to do with any real words that others might contend for. There's a reason for all those crappy nonsense-word names.

We don't do strict contracting, but we do license our iOS software platform and provide custom development work for the apps.<p>Both for our own products, and partner products, we like to begin beta testing apps at quite an embarrassing, early stage in the process. We also basically refuse to spec anything but the most basic features of the app, until we hear from users.<p>In almost every case, the partner agrees to this structure, but then when it comes down to it, they see what we want to release to beta (50-100 users), and then they push back and try and get us to implement features they think are important, or fix bugs they believe matter. They are somewhat incredulous when we push back and decline to bill them hours.<p>It always works out in the end. When the partner starts hearing the incredibly valuable things users say when they test the apps, they immediately understand the value, and it's smooth sailing from there.<p>But trying to get a company to release crappy, buggy, unfinished software to 100 of their real customers seems to always take some doing.<p>We've never had an issue getting paid, and we always require money up front. I did have to struggle once to get 10% of a contract, but I honestly believe it was just accidentally FUBARed.",1316134972

Why don't you just approach these things as if there's no real business there?<p>I may be jaded about this because so many of our bids are competitive, and even a simple bid takes a couple hours to put together. We win most of them, but you get used to sinking time into deals that don't pan out and build it into the process.",1316134949

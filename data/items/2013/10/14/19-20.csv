The idea is to use a relatively small amount of water but at very high pressure provided by the depth of the mine -- the high potential difference makes generation more efficient and reduces capital costs. If this thing turns out to be profitable, this will probably be done to all sufficiently deep mine shafts and other deep enough holes.<p>PDF: <a href=""http://laguna.ethz.ch/indico/getFile.py/access?contribId=2&sessionId=7&resId=0&materialId=slides&confId=12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://laguna.ethz.ch/indico/getFile.py/access?contribId=2&s...</a>",1381780660

Which means we&#x27;ve all inherited an extraordinary privilege - courtesy of the immense efforts of countless others and countless invested wealth - that I would argue is drastically beyond anything Gates had the benefit of despite his family. What have you done with it? (rhetorical)<p>The privilege we&#x27;re all enjoying right now - all of this easily accessible, relatively cheap, amazing technology - is beyond anything being born to a successful Seattle lawyer is worth. Why aren&#x27;t we all millionaires N times over? If you understand that point, then you understand why Gates deserves credit for his wealth.<p>His mother didn&#x27;t make the deal with IBM (in fact Ballmer was arguably most instrumental in the nuanced legal structure that gave Microsoft its position), and his mother didn&#x27;t execute and build software for 30 years against tremendous odds and competition either. Is your theory that Bill Gates should be penalized for being born into a family and situation that was not of his own choosing? Such that you pretend his wealth wasn&#x27;t of his own creation and is null and void, because his father was a lawyer (remind me again what making $100k a year as a lawyer in 1970 has to do with your son generating a $100 billion fortune in 2000, seems to me there are a lot of extraordinary steps required to get from one to the other no matter how good your first step is, whether you&#x27;re Steve Jobs or Bill Gates).<p>There are 9 million millionaires in the US currently, and this country has been rich for a long time now. Why aren&#x27;t we drowning in Bill Gates clones? The answer is obvious.<p>Any idea how many successful lawyer sons didn&#x27;t generate $100 billion in wealth the last 40 years? All of them but one. Gates is one in a million even by that narrow-down.<p>I&#x27;d counter argue that Buffett would have been successful regardless of his father being a Congressman (it&#x27;s absurd to think that a one term trip to DC is what made Buffett what he is). Indeed, using Buffett as an example is the absolute worst thing you could do: the market doesn&#x27;t care if your daddy was a Congressman, it was his massive results that spoke volumes, got people to invest with him over time, and made him rich. Some of his shareholders held for decades. It was his understanding of how to make money, and his ability to sell that vision, that scored his first investments. Even doctors don&#x27;t like to lose $100k to some idiot kid, no matter who their father is (his father wasn&#x27;t that important, and his grandfather&#x27;s stores weren&#x27;t that wildly successful).<p>Or did you think people were buying Berkshire at $100 because his daddy was a a borderline irrelevant Congressman for one term?",1381780233

This provides some interesting context about how those numbers can be so different.<p>1) There&#x27;s only one union employee with a base salary (graph union vs base pay) over $100k, and only 3 non-computer/telco union jobs with a salary above $90k.<p>2) There are a few folks with huge overtime (earning up to an additional 1.5x their salary in overtime). A quarter of the union employees are adding over 20% to their salary from overtime. Nearly 7% are adding over 50%. A total of 21 people are making more from OT than base pay. The big overtime users are mostly making between $50k and 65k a year in base salary, with a few making $80k+.<p>3) As a side-note: The biggest overtime payments go mostly to senior operations foreworkers (usually making $80k+) and train operators (usually making $60-75k). As a percentage of salary, those two titles are some of the leaders, but also joined by system service workers (described on several sites as basically a janitor and making $50-60k).",1381780215

A destination.  And that&#x27;s a common definition I think.<p>His use of system seems to still have goals, they are just smaller and easily achieved.  They also seem to be more related to triggers or starting points.  For example, &quot;go to the gym&quot; not &quot;workout&quot; or &quot;do X reps.&quot;<p>He also provides a relief valve in this case (not <i>having</i> to work out once he gets there if he doesn&#x27;t feel up to it), so that the pressure of the expected follow through to &quot;going to the gym&quot; is relieved and thus not a deterrent.<p>So if I were to apply this to walking, it could be something like &quot;put on walking shoes, exercise clothes, and go outside, everyday.&quot;<p>Or for better food: &quot;Go to the store, buy some veggies I like,&quot; and maybe add on &quot;go through prep work for cooking them.&quot;  The relief valve could be that &quot;I don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to cook and eat this for dinner, but i do have to buy and prep.&quot;",1381780136

These are easiest to give reasonable approximations of normal psychologies to. Or at least a good surface description of their behavior seems to be enough for people to fill in the mind of the character.<p>- A completely artificial character, but constructed on a profile so as to seem real. A bit like how modern artists start drawing characters from a basic frame to give a realistic movement or position, then fill in the details. This I think is harder in literature since you really have to build a detailed profile of the character as a model so that they provide a consistent and believable behavior. But I think this is also limited by what the author understands about people&#x27;s psychology and behavior. If the author can&#x27;t figure what motivates a certain kind of behavior, then they can&#x27;t really build the psych model of the character and you end up with weird, unmotivated characters without agency. Lots of the more painful Literary Fiction I had to suffer through in school is like this. I think this is also dangerous for readers as it conditions them to expect real people to think and behave like this.<p>- A flat archetype or stereotype for a character the author needs in the story but doesn&#x27;t know well enough to write about well. So they become part of the background fabric of the story, providing part of the framework for the better defined characters to work within, but never really coming into their own. Even main characters suffer from this.<p>> And the not-so-good children in Renaissance paintings doesn&#x27;t affect the quality of Mona Lisa at all.<p>It&#x27;s funny you brought up the Mona Lisa, a painting with an expression so strange there&#x27;s little agreement about what emotion it&#x27;s conveying at all.",1381779911

It includes a very useful breakdown of the Linux kernel CSPRNG starting on page 17. The attacks the paper describes start on page 22. The front part of the paper is dominated by a discussion of the theoretical modeling of CSPRNGs, in part because the theoretical foundations for CSPRNGs and their interactions with applications are not well documented.<p>The most important bit of information you probably want to know about this paper is that it is modeling the security of a CSPRNG when its entropy inputs are entirely controlled by attackers. For instance, one of the attacks involves tricking the entropy estimator into believing it&#x27;s seeding itself with high-quality random data when that data in fact has no entropy.<p>This is not a realistic attack scenario for the vast majority (maybe all) of applications.<p>Having said that, the Linux kernel CSPRNG doesn&#x27;t (as far as I know) have a particularly well formalized design.

And even though I normally lean towards free market related views when it comes to regulation and government, I think a high inheritance tax would be justified in western countries. With it universities & infrastructure could be funded and possibly enable more people to get a university degree.<p>My underlying reasoning: Every new generation is a giant possiblity for mankind. Now who do we want to command the most resources? If we had kings, it would be the kings heir, no matter if he is clever or not. Thats bad obviously. If we have capitalism without a high inheritance tax, we might have people like Paris Hilton commanding massive fortunes even though some poor kids might have done a lot better with it if they had a chance of acquiring wealth in the first place.<p>By having a high inheritance tax one would avoid unbelievable fortunes being handed down to people that are not qualified at all.<p>Another aspect is obviously that the state needs to motivate people to work better than their peers. If - like in communism - it doesn&#x27;t matter anymore if I work harder than my peers, so I don&#x27;t work hard. Assuming that most people work for personal gain, wealth, and so that they children have it better than themselves, you need to leave them their wealth during their lifetime and enable them to hand down some part of their income to their kids, and not give all back to the public. If they would have to give everything to the public, the really bright people might stop working at 35 when they accumulated enough wealth for themselves, knowing their children won&#x27;t benefit from it anyways.<p>Good article.",1381779039

Along with that, include a regulation that force said buildings to fit in with the neighbhorhood look. UWS and the West Village here in NYC have great examples of extremely tall buildings that are not Jetson&#x27;s-style eyesores.<p>Also put in place a regulation that says existing building that can be built higher (while keeping the existing external facade) should be. Where this isn&#x27;t possible, knock it down and replace it with a building that keeps the old facade.<p>Change the zoning restrictions and regulations to allow the above, and supply will go up, prices will (eventually) come down, and the neighbhorhood looks will remain similar. Everyone gets some of what they want, and the place stays diverse, vibrant, and does not force local workers to deal with punishing commutes just so they can do their jobs.<p>The above applies just as much to NYC or any other large city that is holding back this kind of development.

Just over 1 kW of sunlight falls per square meter, so I will round up and say that there are 8 GW falling on the plant total.<p><i>So 280 MW of production is 3.5% efficient of peak irradiance.</i><p>BUT average irradiance is smaller than peak:<p><a href=""http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1961-1990/redbook/atlas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1961-1990/redbook...</a><p>It looks like 5 kWh/m2 for Arizona, so that&#x27;s 38.85 GW per day irradiance on 7.77 sq km.  Assuming the plant can put out its maximum capacity for the 18 hours it runs each day, that&#x27;s 280 times 18 = 5 GW per day.<p><i>So it&#x27;s operating at almost 13% efficiency of average irradiance.</i><p>That is very good, considering that they are able to store heat much more cheaply and environmentally friendly than storing electricity in batteries.<p>The most important thing of all is that it doesn&#x27;t have to wait for innovations in photovoltaics.  Anyone can buy land, set up parabolic mirrors, and tinker with forgotten heat engines like Stirling cycle engines or Tesla turbine engines that easily achieve 30, 40, 50% efficiency and approach the Carnot limit.  Conversion of motion to electricity is a solved problem at 95% efficiency.<p>Oh and these plants can be supplemented by biomass, say biodiesel from algae or fuel pellets made of hemp.  If that&#x27;s too granola for the fossil fuel industry, they can also use natural gas.<p>In fact if you study this long enough, you find that there are only two real hurdles: energy storage and connection to the grid (made difficult because of resistance from established utilities).  Generation turns out to be relatively inexpensive because there&#x27;s a sea of free energy all around us.  To put it in perspective, Grand Coulee dam puts out less power than the irradiance falling on the solar plant.  It&#x27;s just more efficient at converting the motion of falling water to electricity:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_hydroelectric_power_stations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_hydroelectric_p...</a><p>It puts out 6.8 times 24 = 163 GW/day.  That&#x27;s 33 of these solar plants.  So every 100 sq miles (260 sq km) of desert is equal to the 324 sq km of area flooded by Grand Coulee.<p>Solar thermal is the hydroelectric of the future and uses less land, which will only improve going forward.  IMHO this will someday dwarf wind and nearly eliminate intermittency issues.",1381778005

How many food recalls have already happened this year?  Compare that with other years..  These recalls are not from better testing and transparency because these recalls are for food already in the market and sickening people.",1381777352

Back in the messrs koch and dinkins eras, NYC was a dump,  by and large.<p>San Jose takes crime seriously and it&#x27;s constantly up there among the safest large cities in the US.<p>One can only wish The EB will take crime more seriously.  SF is slowly taking crime more seriously.  Maybe the EB can lear from SJ and SF a bit.<p>Undoubtedly some people will raise the issue of profiling criminal behavior[1].  If I had to choose between simmering street violence and occasional police excess (where one can seek redress), I&#x27;d choose the latter.  Not sure why the EB is so anti-police so much as to spite their own safety.  The good of being better policed vastly outweighs, to me, the occasional bad cop.  But to each their own.<p>One phenomenon I don&#x27;t understand so well.  In NYC I&#x27;d see people dress us as (wannabe) mobsters (acquire their style), but they were no mobsters, tho maybe they idolized them in some way --they would complain that they&#x27;d get flack from the police.  Maybe if they didn&#x27;t try to pretend to be toughs the police wouldn&#x27;t think they were toughs.  I can see some similarities in the &#x27;anarchists&#x27; in the EB.",1381777341

If anyone is curious Krugle has the highest click thru with Koders and Google coming in at about the same.

Also, the monetization value of regular visitors that typically do not click on ads is near $0.<p>I think there may be some miscommunication.<p>Voluntary tipping improves the monetization of typically hard to monetize regular visitors.  I'm suggesting that there are other things you can do to improve the tipping rate/amount from these regular visitors; one of them being to remove advertising from a site for a visitor when they tip past some threshold or something.",1204259550

It's a deformity on the programming language tree of life, encasing all those terrible procedural habits and style into another layer of complexity. You have to say everything three or four times.

Not so good.<p>Anyhow, why didn't these fellows get sued for producing hardware so similar to Sinclair?:<p>The Jupiter ACE was a British home computer of the 1980s, marketed by a company named Jupiter Cantab and named after the early British computer, the ACE. The company was formed by Richard Altwasser and Steven Vickers, who had been on the design team for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. ... The Jupiter ACE somewhat resembled a ZX81 in a white case, with black rubber keys like the Spectrum. ... The font of the character set was identical to that of the Spectrum ... the editor was like the Sinclair editor rather than the original Forth editor. ... Several words were borrowed from Sinclair BASIC. -- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_ACE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_ACE</a>",1204258747

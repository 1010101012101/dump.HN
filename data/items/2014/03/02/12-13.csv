I want to be able to insert comments. And I want to be able to describe it as &quot;JSON, but you can use comments&quot;, so people will be able to understand it immediately and edit the files.

The blub idea, furthermore, is about the &quot;expression problem&quot;, and it&#x27;s condescending to people by assuming that that&#x27;s all that matters.<p>People chose to write something in C, C++, Assembly, Lisp, Haskell whatever for lots of reasons, and the success of that undertaking involves a lot more reason than &quot;expression&quot;. Things like community, libraries, toolsets, hireability, existing codebase, documentation, speed, heck, even familiarity, play a role as much, or even more, important than the mere &quot;expression&quot; capability of the language.<p>And, statistically speaking, the oh-so-expression language people don&#x27;t have much to show for it, whereas the blub C/C++ people have tens of thousands of indispensable programs used by billions. Sure, they are much less, but at one point they were much more (Lisp existed before C/C++), and they also had nice funding going on until the mid-eighties, with not much to show for it. 3-4 C people in AT&T laid the foundation for most of what we use today.

7328837,comment,7327933,7328419,1,0,dasil003,,,"Although I&#x27;m not religious, I am agnostic.  Why?  Because no one can credibly say they know a damn thing about the metaphysical.  To me, hardcore atheists are almost as bad as religious fundamentalists in their own way.  Basically, both groups of people believe something which they feel everyone else needs to accept or else they&#x27;re wrong and are evil.  And in both cases the thing they are so self-assured about is essentially unknowable.<p>To me, religion is a branch of philosophy.  There are a lot of useful ideas developed there over the centuries.  Atheists often talk about the evil created religion, but evil will use whatever tool is available—we sit in this forum worshiping startups, yet capitalism has done just as much evil as religion (or at least, it&#x27;s on its way to).  The other thing atheist fundamentalists do (as peterforde does above) is set up a strawman to be argued from a scientific perspective.  If you say that god is a bearded man sitting in the sky then of course it sounds ridiculous, but that&#x27;s ignoring the fact that it&#x27;s a millenia-old imagery created for pre-scientific people.  As much as we get angry over evolution-deniers and creationists, it&#x27;s equally ridiculous to cherry-pick some age old metaphor, state as a falsifiable hypothesis and then demonstrate its ridiculousness on scientific grounds.<p>Atheists often claim rationality on their side, but how rational is it to invoke religious beliefs in a thread about sexist asshole talk?  It&#x27;s an utter non-sequitur and what it demonstrates is an irrational axe to grind.",1393761859

Anyone who knows me knows that I am a big fan of nifty tricks that solve the problem. When I first heard about the Facebook effort I was assuming they were writing a JIT based on LLVM V8 or something along those lines. Writing a good JIT is hard. Doing static code analysis and generating compilable C++ from it is indeed a nifty trick. It's not ""just"" a nifty trick, it is a cool trick that takes advantage of a number of characteristics of PHP. The main one being that you can't overload PHP functions. strlen() is always strlen, for example. In Python, this would be harder because you can overload everything.<p>> I also noted that most sites on the Web have a lot of lower hanging fruit that would provide a much bigger performance improvement, if fixed, than doubling the speed of the PHP execution phase. The ReadWriteWeb site, for example, needs 160 separate HTTP requests and 41 distinct DNS lookups to load the front page. And once you get beyond the frontend inefficiencies you usually find Database issues, inefficient system call issues and general architecture problems that again aren't solved by speeding up PHP execution.",1265316811

1101574,comment,1101015,1101428,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Yeah, I was thinking more along the lines of Systems Hungarian.<p>After thinking about it more, I think I've decided over the years that problems like variable type should be handled in the architecture, not the variable names. If encoding your variable types in your variable names is doing you any good, then either your functions are getting a lot longer than they really ought to be, or you've got more globals than you should, or you aren't correctly handling objects.<p>I think this is true even for Apps Hungarian. It looks like Joel's article [1] is one of the most-cited resources on Apps Hungarian, and the specific example he uses is for signaling safe versus unsafe strings in a web application. He comes up with a somewhat convoluted example of why you might want to keep an ""unsafe"" string around, but I don't buy it. Every single input in a web application (for one example) should be vetted before any processing on the input takes place. You might not want to HTML-encode a string going to your credit card interface, but you certainly do want to validate it.<p>This is actually even more the case in things like traditional C/C++ applications, because the code bases get so much larger than the average web application. By the time you get to inner functions, they shouldn't need to care whether the input is correct or not; it should have already been handled elsewhere.<p>The one exception to this -- in my case anyway -- is in resolving variable scope. If I'm starting to use too many globals, it's hard to ignore lots of ""gSomething"" all over the place. That's a signal to me that it's time to re-think what I'm doing. Likewise with the loop counters. Prepending ""x"" to local variables just reduces name collisions with other functions and objects and whatnot.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html</a>",1265316712

She was afraid to touch the electronic thermostat... even though it only had two buttons and just displayed the set temp and the current temp. She was deathly afraid that she would 'break' it.<p>{edit} On the other hand, you also have people that constantly break things as a result of their own actions, and refuse to change. My friend's sister would be constantly corrupting her external hard drive because she would just yank the plug to remove her laptop from her desk. My friend would fix things and <i>repeatedly</i> tell her <i>not</i> to do that, but it would always happen again.<p>People are <i>all</i> over the spectrum. There are people that are just downright afraid of new things, and there are people that just take everything for granted (not caring what the consequences of their actions are).",1265314008

These detectors have a sweet spot which is a few orders of magnitude below the energy measured here. So there is always the question of how well you can extrapolate.<p>You'll notice there is no uncertainty quoted on the energy. It would not be unreasonable to expect that uncertainty is at least 1 order of magnitude in each direction. Probably more.<p>While that might seem like a lot, it's also important to know that the relevant measurement is not the particle's energy, but actually the number of particles above a certain energy.

I don't usually comment on my own articles on HN, but this comment was one of the more negative ones I've seen here.<p>A lot of us here on Hacker News (formerly Startup News) are working on startups. One of the biggest challenges facing startups is finding the determination to work hard during the long initial period where you might see very few fruits from your labors. Personally, I like to read pg's ""How Not to Die"" frequently (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html</a>). It was in this light that I wrote the article. I submitted it to HN and apparently it struck a chord with a lot of readers here, and they upvoted it.<p>Not every article on HN is going to appeal to every reader. Perhaps you're not working on a startup, so this article doesn't really apply to you. Maybe my next one will.

The idea is that a huge proportion of the environmental footprint people have comes from their homes, transportation, work, and materials. If a collection of green entrepreneurs, scientists, and engineers are then living together under that one roof, then they can use that home as a prototype for the new technologies, products, methodologies, and ways of thinking and living for a future green society. From there, we can spin them out into the world, through journalism or as actual products.<p>----<p>The main problem with such incubators is that the big ideas are a tiny part of the game.

The single repository means that you can dig in to find & fix problems in any Google product, regardless of your position in the org chart.  And if someone invents a feature that you want to use, you can just grab it, like the appearance of Wonder Wheel on YouTube.<p>Google has a strong ethos of ""If it's broke, fix it"", regardless of the org chart or assigned responsibilities.  It's usually mentioned to you as a Noogler, but what really reinforces it is the reaction you get when you actually fix something broken.  In a lot of companies, there'd be a bunch of ""Who <i>is</i> this guy and why is he mucking with our code?"" recriminations (if you can even get access to the code).  In Google there's a ""thanks for doing this"" and sometimes a peer bonus.<p>Code reviews help a lot, somewhat paradoxically.  When all code is reviewed, you lose the fear that you'll break somebody else's code with your fix.  You make your fix, send it off, and if there're problems they'll have you fix them in the review.  If it conflicts with the overall goals of the project, they'll just deny your patch.<p>In a system without code reviews, chances are that you'll break something by contributing to a project that you don't really know about.  And once enough people have broken things, the company institutes code ownership policies that mean you <i>can't</i> fix things in other products.<p>There's also 20% time, as someone else mentioned.  And the combination of free meals and pretty fluid inter-project mobility.  It's likely that your teammates have worked on other projects before, with people who are now in wildly different areas of the company.<p>Finally, there's just the difference in growth rates between the two companies.  Everybody at Google has more work than they can reasonably do.  If somebody else does the work, it just means you can go home early this week, and there'll be plenty of other things to accomplish next week.  If you spend 3 months writing a dialog box in Windows, though, and somebody makes that feature obsolete...well, that rather sucks.",1265313662

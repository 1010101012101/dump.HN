Facebook is currently a bit of a side focus for us right now, so we are looking for someone to become our lead Facebook developer and drive this forward.<p>As our lead Facebook Developer, you would attend all FbFund incubator meetings and sessions for us, and would get the full benefits of being a FbFund finalist, including any publicity that comes from our future Facebook efforts.<p>We need someone to start ASAP, and commit to working with us full time at least through the summer (hopefully longer if things work out).  Pay will be crappy, the equity comp will be decent, and the opportunity we think is awesome—probably the only way to get into the 09 FbFund incubator at this point.  We are based in Berkeley, and may be moving to SF in the near future.<p>We don’t have any formal requirements, but in addition to doing Facebook app development, we will also want you to spend a lot of your time doing JavaScript intensive UI.  So please be able to show us you are pretty slick at doing cool AJAX development.<p>Send an email to chris@life360.com or give us a call at 415 462 0002 x706.<p>If anyone on this board has any other suggestions on where to find good FB developers, please let us know in the comments!",1243118365

623887,comment,623710,623710,0,0,crhulls,,,"The advice people are giving you is way too complex. Here is the simple answer: Don't worry about taxes in this case.<p>1) An 83b is irrelevant for this problem (you aren't vesting over time, thus there is no chance of a large increase in the share price before you get your grant)<p>2) You <i>aren't</i> getting $2000 a month in stock.  You are getting what he is saying is a fair equivalent of $2000 a month.  You might have to report a couple bucks a month in income to the IRS, but it will be negligible because the real value of anything he gives you will be basically zero on paper<p>3) You pay taxes on the market rate of anything you get..keep that in mind.<p>4) If you really don't want to worry, don't get a stock or options grant, just ""purchase"" your shares from the company.  At a fraction of a cent each, the shares are essentially free, so just write the guy a check.  Since you bought them you won't be taxed until you have a gain.",1243117949

623884,comment,623710,623810,0,0,tptacek,,,"I agree with your skepticism about the deal, but not because of taxes. Handling the taxes in a situation like this is a pain in the ass.<p>The odds of any startup succeeding in any business climate (let alone ours) is low. As employee #1 in the company, you'd want that $2k to be getting a founder's multiple. I don't know what that number is, but my mind jumps to 5-10x. So each time you're getting $2k worth of stock, you want it backed with a story that in 2 years makes you $10-$20k.<p>The question in this post doesn't contain any numbers (revenue, projections, go-to-market, funding plans), which makes me think that conversation hasn't happened yet with the founder. So what I think is, taking this deal is basically shoveling $2k/mo into a black hole.<p>I've been in this exact situation twice. I accepted the deal both times. The first time I came out about $20k behind where I would have been with straight salary. The second time, my ""investment"" made a little better than 25x, which set me up for my own first startup. So it's not like I think this is a rip-off; I just think you're leaving too much up to chance.<p>Finally, I don't like how Denny is wording this response. $60k/yr is a healthy pre-revenue startup paycheck. It's not rockstar comp, but it's not a rip-off either. If you're getting solid W2 wages, I think it's hard to say that the business ""owes"" you anything outside of what you can negotiate.",1243117688

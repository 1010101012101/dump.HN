Of course, we were working with a small sample (about 100 invites), all of whom were personal / culled contacts.  We used the ""beta"" label in the old fashioned sense, which I guess is now more appropriate to call an alpha.<p>I would suggest that rather than comparing to other groups, you really focus on that as your baseline metric.  Look at it as a time-series, not inter-company.  So you have 7% and 15%; what can you do to raise the 7% to 15?  Realize that it'll always be more difficult to get people to return to signup, versus when you have their attention on your page, so I would expect on-page signups to be higher.<p>What's your product?

From looking at your site and watching your video, I can't tell whether you intend to sell my list of clips to advertisers, connect it to my name and make it available in a data dump, or any one of 100 other things I have no interest in you doing.<p>As for your web page, why make such a user-unfriendly thing as a log-in screen your main page? Why not include the video on the main page so I don't have to click 3 or 4 times to start finding out what the heck your service even is.<p>That said, I think you get it, and that's refreshing. For me, Google Notebook and Evernote are too linear. Zoho Notebook is too complicated. No one else has really sparked my interest.<p>The two main features I want in an online notebook are the ability to grab anything from anywhere with minimal effort and the ability to organize things freely. These you deliver quite well.<p>There are a few features I would definitely consider.<p>1. Inline notes. If a note is really short, it would nice to be able to just stick it on the page as plain text, instead of having to double click to open it. This would add a lot to the ability to freely organize things because you could use notes as headers, separators, whatever.<p>2. Inline pictures. Since there's a little preview of the picture anyway, why not let me clear away the title and URL and just show the picture. Then, if you're doing that, why not let me resize it. Again, this goes to letting me freely drag stuff around however I want it. It would also let me use a picture as a background or header or just about anything else.<p>3. Sharing at least read access to a project with someone else. This is pretty big. The reason I started looking into online notebooks in the first place was to plan vacations with my fiancee. I can share login details, and that's fine, but eventually, I'm going to want to share a view of a project with someone I don't trust with my login.<p>And one little minor thing. Double-clicking an open folder should close it.<p>I also think it might be cool if you could arrange things inside folders just like you can on the main project page. At the very least, reordering would be nice.<p>Just so we're clear after all that: My overall impression is very, very positive.",1275598489

Basically all he is doing is checking that clojure's map function works. When your unit test says the same thing as the thing you are testing, I think it's pretty obvious you've failed somewhere.<p>The most important thing to test here is that the accumulate-forces (and by extension calculate-forces-on-all) function gives the right values, that is what you need to be testing. There are even several ways to do that without just plugging in magic numbers - for example you can generate random inputs and verify that the vector sum of all forces is 0 (I think this would be correct because gravity acts on two objects equal and opposite). You can verify the higher level functions by checking that momentum and energy are conserved.",1275598440

Some people probably exaggerate their experience and some people I've seen end up in manager/""architect"" roles that don't require actual coding and seem to forget how.<p>Also, when you're hiring, you're getting a skewed picture of the overall programming population.  Suppose (to make the math easy) that there are 100,000 programmers in the world, 90% of which are employed.  So that leaves 10,000 programmers in the candidate pool.  Most of the top 20% of those will be able to get a job from a referral and not go through a ""normal"" hiring process, so if you're screening resumes you're now down to the next 80%.  But that's the bottom 80% <i>of the 10% that's looking for a job</i>.  Of those, some are competent people between jobs or looking for a change, but a lot of them are just in the bottom 10% of the overall skill level, are basically unhirable, and are semi-permanently on the job market because of that.<p>To make another simplification, if you and I both screen 100 resumes in the same area, there's a reasonable chance that the 10 best candidates we see are different since they go off the market so quickly, but that the 10 worst candidates we see are the same, since they stay on the market.  And unfortunately, some of those totally unhirable people have good-looking resumes.",1275597591

When the ""Facebook has security and privacy issues, and might be evil"" meme gets around, people start looking for more weaknesses and quickly find them. From my limited experience in startups, none would be immune to such scrutiny.<p>Facebook is at a very challenging point right now: they need strong short-term PR, very fast patching up of issues as they arise, cleaning out the tech debt they acquired in their youth, and most importantly, battling off the fierce competitors of all stripes and colors: from Google to Twitter to foursquare. Will they be able to do it? Based mostly on their ability to capture as large a market as they did and their fast attention to issues as they arise, I think so: as long as they don't piss off their users enough for them to leave en masse (and they haven't - most of their users don't care about the privacy issues we go crazy over), they just need to hold on and keep doing more or less what they've been doing.",1275597363

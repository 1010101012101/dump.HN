Note that this administration&#x27;s Department of Justice previously circulated a similar memo with regard to states that had legalized marijuana for medical purposes, and US Attorneys in those states subsequently undertook enforcement actions (both criminal charges and forfeiture actions) against state-legal dispensaries, and their landlords, in those states -- note that this <i>includes</i> the current US Attorney in Colorado, who prosecuted state-legal dispensaries when that state had legalized marijuana only for medical purposes.<p>And note that the guidance <i>expressly</i> includes it remaining a priority to prosecute marijuana offenses to the extent that prosecution is useful to prevent drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use, or where officials feel that they are being marketed (not merely <i>sold</i>) to minors, among other cases. This, even within the wording of the guidance, provides a pretty broad opening for prosecuting state-legal activities.",1382554685

We always say humans who don&#x27;t finish their prescription are allowing some of the most resistant strains to survive, when taking the full prescription would generally finish off everything (even the moderately resistant strains) preventing selection. Farm animals that never <i>stop</i> taking antibiotics never provide that window of opportunity for unresistant strains to take hold and then undergo selection due to antibiotic regimes that are ended too soon.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ve got the wrong idea here, but is this particularly different from, say, a petri dish full of sulfuric acid, and a petri dish that periodically has some acid introduced for a short period of time?

Culturally, it&#x27;s not very well accepted now, but that will change.

They most certainly have mechanisms that are engaged actively in order to increase chances of survival. Horizontal gene transfer (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer</a>) allows bacteria to evolve in means other than traditional reproduction.<p>To add to my pedantic argument, it&#x27;s not a conscious desire of theirs, but I&#x27;d argue that the basic things that humans do to survive (eat, drink, sleep, and have sex) are not conscious desires either. I&#x27;d argue that sexual reproduction is a mechanism that directly represents the biological success of greater genetic diversity and sharing of genes between organisms. We desire sex, and we desire sex with the best genetic candidates, and it&#x27;s all a biological process encoded into our DNA that represents our desire for survival, so in that sense, bacteria desire survival as well.<p>And what does desire even mean? Does desire require consciousness and the ability to choose?

6600786,comment,6598435,6598435,1,0,tzs,,,"This could be a bit more subtle than it might first appear. Most countries have in their copyright something that allows an entity that has a lawfully made and lawfully obtained physical object that they obtained from someone else to resell that particular object without violating copyright.<p>This is why used bookstores can exist legally.<p>This is also why when you buy a Samsung TV from Best Buy, and want the GPL code, you have to ask Samsung rather than Best Buy. Best Buy did distribute the TV (and thus the binary software contained therein) to you, but since that distribution did not require permission of the copyright owner Best Buy has no GPL obligation.<p>Note that this works for Best Buy because they are essentially receiving copies of the software and then just passing those copies through to their customers, in a one to one manner. If Best Buy were modifying the code in the TV, of if they were copying the code into other TVs (say copying the code from a high end TV model to a lower end model to enable premium features), then they would no longer be operating in a one to one pass through fashion, and would need permission of the copyright owner--and then WOULD have GPL obligations and you would turn to Best Buy for the code to your television.<p>Now suppose some OEM makes a generic TV platform. It consists of the guts of the TV (display, power supply, electronics, and firmware), ready to be put in to a case. A company like Kogan or Best Buy that wants a house brand TV can buy the guts from the OEM, put it into a case they have someone else make for them that has their name on it, and sell it as their own.<p>Suppose also that the firmware consists of a minimal Linux system, configured to automatically start a shell running as user &#x27;tv&#x27; after boot, and the startup scripts for the &#x27;tv&#x27; user start a minimal X server, and then run ~/tvapp, which just puts up a minimal TV GUI that lets you change channels and adjust the volume.<p>The company buying these and rebranding them (who I shall call &quot;the store&quot;) as their own writes their own version of tvapp that puts up a full featured GUI that allows for control of all the TV features (or they license a full featured tvapp from someone else and just replace the graphics and modify the text so it looks like it is theirs).<p>If the OEM that made the generic TV guts was careful, all modifications the store makes consist of just replacing ~/tvapp. They do not do anything that would create a derivative work of any of the open source code that the OEM used, and that code is just passed through from the OEM to the consumer one to one with no copying, and the net result is that the store does not end up with any obligation to provide anyone with copies of the source to the open source code in their TV.<p>Applying this to the present case, the big question then is just what is Kogan doing to produce their branded phones and tablets and TVs? Are they dealing with an OEM like the hypothetical one I described above, and just adding user mode applications to a generic system that is being treated as a black box? If so, then they in fact not be violating any licenses, and it would be the OEM that people need to turn to for their copies of the source.<p>On the other hand, if they were doing something like getting generic devices from one OEM, and taking firmware that got from a contractor, and installing copies of that firmware into the OEM devices, and the contractor used open source in that firmware, then Kogan would be responsible for providing the source code. In this case, they are making copies, not just passing on copies they received one for one to their customers.<p>Based on a quick (and perhaps imperfect) read of the article, I was not able to tell which of the above best describes what Kogan is doing. Do we know?",1382554174

Those are subjective terms. You can draw your own conclusions from the study<p>> The real question is, what if you don&#x27;t compare WebP to JPEG, but instead, compare it to APNG, then how does the calculus come out?<p>I don&#x27;t know off the top of my head. I agree that this should be studied.<p>What I&#x27;m quibbling with is the notion that we should just rush to adopt large proposals like WebP if they&#x27;re a marginal improvement in <i>any</i> area. Like I said, on the Web we are stuck with mistakes forever if they gain traction. Maybe the story would have been different if WebP had been just the WebP-lossless-animated portion. (I don&#x27;t call the shots, except in Servo, but I would <i>personally</i> have no issues with adopting WebP-lossless-animated.) But WebP is tied together with the lossy compression that seems to have issues relative to JPEG. &quot;Two steps forward, one step back&quot; is less attractive than &quot;two steps forward&quot;.<p>Google says WebP versus PNG is 28%, so I would expect the results for WebP-animated versus APNG to be similar.

The implementation of the full JOBS Act has been on the horizon for over a year and I think it has a lot of potential to do good.<p>That said, I&#x27;m nervous about overzealous regulations. There are a few ways this can create severe enough adverse selection that healthy, high-caliber companies will avoid raising from the unaccredited crowd.<p>I&#x27;m still reading the details in the 585 page PDF of proposed rules but some concerns come to mind:<p><pre><code>    - Capping the whole round to $1m
    - Forcing unnecessary financial disclosures
    - Inability to use a single purpose fund for aggregating small investors (forcing every unaccredited to be a direct investor)
</code></pre>
I believe these are all feel-good but destructive rules that will poison the unaccredited crowdinvesting ecosystem. At Wefunder we&#x27;ve learned a lot about what it takes to get high caliber startups to use our platform and I&#x27;m pretty confident that those three things can each be deal breakers.<p>If you&#x27;re a part of the startup ecosystem I encourage you to pay attention to this law, get informed, and give the SEC your feedback.

E.g. an antibiotic might disrupt a single process of the bacteria that is beneficial (for them) but that have a multitude of similar alternatives that are different enough for the antibiotic to fail. Compare that to even just being able to strongly enough attach to the skin to not be flushed away by sheer force from  a wash.<p>There are many reasons that tends to be given for being careful about stronger measures: 1) it is not necessary. It&#x27;s a matter of being cautious - by using the least effective means that is effective enough, we exert the minimum pressure necessary, leaving us with a larger arsenal of (to us) gentle alternatives to step up to. 2) the stronger methods, the more we kill off beneficial or neutral bacteria too, and by doing so we may make conditions better for bacteria that are nasty for us if we happen to pick them up.
3) we reduce our immune systems exposure to relatively harmless amounts of bacteria and some believe this may be sufficient to actually reduce our overall immune defence.<p>As DanBC pointed out in response to one of my other comments, there&#x27;s also the issue of physical damage. While we can bring the heavy artillery and effectively kill anything that lives on our skin, we can as collateral damage cause damage to our skin that creates additional places to hide - effectively a worse variation of washing away good/neutral baceteria - not only may we be removing the competition, but we may be opening cracks and folds that&#x27;ll be excellent hiding places.",1382551998

Its not like government PR would not love to bring proof of the dangers of leaks.<p>The reason why no actually body has been found, is that the included names was mistakes made by the people in the field who mistakably put some in the low security reports. Normally, such names are only added to high level security reports, which mean that the number of names in the low level reports where quite few/limited, and possible already evacuated long before the reports were made public.<p>High level security reports was sorted out by Wikileaks/leaker before publishing.",1372373987

Anyone else see this?<p>The team Red Ride came in 1st place at the Seattle event. For full disclosure, I worked on a different team that I thought could win. When we learned that Red Ride bested us, I congratulated them, accepted a friendly defeat, and genuinely was thankful to be part of the event. Last weekend I learned that one of the group members worked for SW. Curious, I started digging and discovered that 4 of the 6 Red Ride team members currently work for SW.

5955243,comment,5954690,5954690,1,0,erlkonig,,,"Austin is hot, over 100F for a long time in the summer, snowless 4 years out of 5.  It has a deliberately bad highway system leading to a three-hour rush hour from 4 PM to 7 PM on weekdays.  Granted, anyone from Los Angeles would probably laugh at this plaint, since even in rush hour, one will still make it home at some point here.  There&#x27;s a little light rail,  and an unimpressive but functional bus system. Be warned that bicycling in Austin can be challenging in some areas.  Austin&#x27;s surrounded by bible-belt, republican Texas, but - in part due to the large university-derived community - has a diverse and surprisingly democratic/unaffiliated contingent in the city itself, including fringe religions and spiritualism (Wicca, etc), and a wealth of musicians, artists, and digerati.  (We&#x27;ve likened it to West Berlin surrounded by East Germany before 1994) Restaurants are legion, we have Frys Electronics, Alamo Draughthouse (cinema + dining + local attitude) and lots of 3D cinemas, maker shops, etc.  Consumer ISPs here are Time Warner, Uverse, etc, although getting both a static IP and good customer service from them is a faint dream, and Austin is not a mecca of cheap Internet, sadly, although offered speeds are pretty good.  ISP options are a little wider along IH35, including Grande and possibly others. Google networking is coming in 2014.  There are a lot of good options here for server colocation.  Houses are easily available under the $200k mark for ~2k sqft in some fairly nice areas farther from the city center, with property taxes perhaps being around[ $4k/y on such - however, prices scale up substantially in some areas, especially deeper in town.  There&#x27;s a sales tax just over 8%, but no state income tax.  There are a number of nice outdoor areas, some scenic views in the western, hillier side, parks, a (smallish) river through town, Lake Travis nearby (both are typified by rather murky green water), and so forth, although more popular in summer with those who can take the heat.  The downtown area has scads of live music performers and dancing available.  We have an active local faultline, the Balcones Fault, but the most notable earthquake on hit a 3.0 in Irving, TX, and Austinites aren&#x27;t aware of any local earthquake activity.  Burning Man isn&#x27;t here, but we do have a Burning Flipside event popular with much of the same crowd.<p>Austin is rife with startups :-)",1372373881

Austin is much sleepier the rest of the year and even during southby you may have noticed that stuff pretty much closes down at 2am<p>- The Austin tech scene is mostly B2B startups, consultant shops, bigger more established tech (think IBM and Dell), the newer shiner (for lack of a better way to put it) companies mostly have smaller encampments here. (i.e Facebook has an office in one of the towers downtown. Apple has a fairly sizeable campus north of town and they are expanding but not much there yet.)<p>- Second checkout these quoras answers they say alot about it.<p><a href=""http://www.quora.com/Why-wont-Austin-TX-become-the-next-Silicon-Valley/answer/Shon-Bayer?srid=X0&share=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Why-wont-Austin-TX-become-the-next-Sili...</a><p><a href=""http://www.quora.com/How-does-Austin-compare-to-Silicon-Valley-as-a-place-to-live-and-work-(in-tech)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/How-does-Austin-compare-to-Silicon-Vall...</a><p>- O and meetups in Austin...<p>Another thing about Austin is you will meet some genuinely smart people who are good and passonate about what they do... and you&#x27;ll also run into the types who are &quot;looking for a technical founder&quot; alot too.<p>It sucks that you&#x27;ll find alot of those at the meetups for more well known languages or frameworks. You&#x27;ll have to dig deep into more esoteric or cutting edge topics if you really want to meet good technical people here and not just people looking for someone to do it for them.<p>Also just about all of the meetup groups have an online presence just google &quot;[you favor subject] austin meetup&quot;<p>i.e. Austin on Rails is a good one<p><a href=""http://austinonrails.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://austinonrails.org/</a><p>- You&#x27;ll definitely also want to look up Capital factory<p><a href=""http://capitalfactory.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://capitalfactory.com/</a><p>There are a metric ton of startups there.<p>They also have showcases and host a big portion of one of my two favorite Austin events. The Startup Crawl. As matter of fact if you can swing it figure out when the next one of those is and come then. You&#x27;ll meet a bunch of people in the scene that way... its another big party event much like sxsw but it is much more local so you&#x27;ll get a flavor of the people actually here.",1372373017

Furthermore, this argument is well regarded by many smart people, who find that it is applicable in many places.  That doesn&#x27;t make it right, but it does mean when you assert something that conflicts with the argument, you better either acknowledge that you reject the widely-regarded argument, or explain why the argument doesn&#x27;t apply in this case.<p>Now, you assert Z is justified, which a lot of people say looks a lot like X.  In fact, Z = X + delta_X.  Furthermore, it is agreed by everyone that Y does not hold in this case.  So some people say, &quot;Z is effectively X, and Y doesn&#x27;t hold, so Z is unjustified.&quot; You say, &quot;but Z != X.  Therefore this argument breaks down.  Here&#x27;s my new argument for justification&quot;.  But someone replies &quot;but delta_X is small, and I claim that it doesn&#x27;t change the outcome of the original argument&quot;.<p>You can&#x27;t respond &quot;But Z is not the same thing as X, so we should use completely different arguments to judge justified-ness.&quot;  You either need to claim that delta_X is large enough to break the original argument, or acknowledge that you disagree with that argument.<p>I believe you&#x27;re misinterpreted me to be saying &quot;Snowden&#x27;s actions are trying to be civil disobedience, but they don&#x27;t have all the qualities of justified civil disobedience, therefore it&#x27;s unjustified&quot;.

I&#x27;d be a bit embarrassed to tell my friends but it was very useful.<p>-Working at a company, as an employee, I slowly got the trust and respect of my colleagues. Not having co-workers must be one of the hardest parts of freelancing. Even if I&#x27;m not happy with my performance on a task, I know my boss knows I&#x27;m usually effective, and that does help me remember that too. Maybe if you worked in a group with other freelancers instead of alone, it would be easier?<p>-I got into a very good relationship. That means that my work is only part of what I care about, so if it&#x27;s going badly, then it&#x27;s not all of me.<p>More generally, if you are struggling a bit, there are probably things in your life that would legitimately cause anyone stress.<p>Maybe you are taking on full stack projects, but are only comfortable with (front)(back) end work. Maybe your under pressure from your family to make money. Maybe you are having trouble learning the business side of things, while coding at the same time.<p>Either way, if you can work out what those are, and avoid them, it&#x27;ll give you more energy to deal with everything else.<p>Sometimes though, you need make a big change, sacrifice something. I didn&#x27;t carry on in academia after the masters where I struggled, and went back to programming instead. It seemed like I was giving up on my future at the time, but it&#x27;s very easy to come up with a new vision of your future. It&#x27;s much harder to struggle towards one from a bad place. Could it be worth being an employee for a bit, then going back to freelancing when you are more confident? Or going back to school for a bit (there is always funding)?<p>Those would be pretty radical - you&#x27;ve built a business, and you&#x27;d lose a lot of it by putting it on pause.

I&#x27;ve spent a bit of time in SF over the years, and love it there, but just can&#x27;t imagine <i>living</i> there.<p>* Heat: It&#x27;s hot in the summer.  Really hot.  Over 100 most days.  After some time, you just accept it and move on with life.  You stay inside.  You live later in the evening when it&#x27;s dark and cooler.  The flip side of this is that for 8 months out of the year, the weather is pretty incredible :)<p>* Startups:  There are lots of startups here.  But you&#x27;ll find that Austin tends to not focus as much on the consumer oriented startups.  So many of them you&#x27;ll never really have heard of.  Some success stories are Spiceworks, Indeed, HomeAway, BazaarVoice, and Mass Relevance.  There are also lots of agencies based here that are always looking to hire.  There&#x27;s also a big VC here (Austin Ventures) and an incubator that&#x27;s had some success (Capital Factory).<p>* Tech Community: The Javascript and Ruby/Rails communities are very active.  Each hosts a conference each year that are well attended and respected.  Again, SXSW is here each March which is also pretty incredible.<p>* City: Austin is awesome.  Live Music, Lakes, Pools, Great Food, SXSW, ACL, F1... I could go on... seriously, it&#x27;s pretty sweet.<p>* Restaurants: Yes.  Awesome.  In the last 5 years, it&#x27;s really exploded.  I&#x27;m constantly amazed by the amount of great food that&#x27;s available now.  A lot of it stems from the rise of trailers a few years back.  The best ones have gone on to open brick and morder locations.  Notable standouts: Uchi, Barley Swine, Perla&#x27;s, Franklin BBQ, Homeslice Pizza, La Condessa, Sway, Torchy&#x27;s Tacos.  So much good food.  And if you&#x27;re willing to drive an hour outside of Austin, there are probably 50 <i>authentic</i> Texas BBQ places in the surrounding area.  Also beer.  A few incredible breweries have started over the last few years.<p>* $$: Definitely cheaper to live here than SF or NY :)",1372371749

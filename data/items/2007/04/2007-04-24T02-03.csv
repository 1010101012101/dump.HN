I think my favorite is when he cited ""Dr. Gary Larson's"" definitive paper on static type systems.<p><a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/10/egomania-itself.html"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/10/egomania-itself.html</a>

Travel and visit friends/family scattered across the globe. Then I think I'd end up doing some kind of startup hackery like Joe Kraus or PG.

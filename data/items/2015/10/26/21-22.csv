10454738,comment,10453336,10453336,0,0,roymurdock,,,"Deflation is a largely misunderstood bogeyman in economics. Ultimately, central banks are scared of deflation because they lose power over conventional stimulus tools once the interest rates, and consequently inflation, reach zero, or move into negative territory due to market forces outside of the central bank&#x27;s control.<p>Why does the Fed see a 2% yearly inflation target as good?<p><i>The Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve&#x27;s statutory mandate. Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.</i><p>Very vague and hand-wavey, but basically just saying that they like to have a 2% cushion between expected inflation and the traditional 0% floor, beyond which lies the spooooooky land of deflation. This 2% gives them room to raise and lower the federal funds rate (short term interest rate) to their heart&#x27;s content without setting off any deflationary fire alarms in the economy. If you&#x27;re really interested, here&#x27;s a good overview from Bernanke (2003) on how and why the practice got started in the 1970s. [2]<p>Ok, let&#x27;s see what our favorite Austrian economist, Friedrich von Hayek has to say about inflation targeting: &quot;any form of inflation, even mild inflations, ultimately produce the recurring depressions and unemployment which have been a justified grievance against the free enterprise system and must be prevented if a free society is to survive.&quot; [1]<p>He argues that inflation distorts signals such as price and profit. This leads to the misallocation of resources to firms that look good on paper, but that could actually be failing to produce meaningful and sustainable economic returns:<p><i>The initial general stimulus which an increase of the quantity of money provides is chiefly due to the fact that prices and therefore profits turn out to be higher than expected. Every venture succeeds, including even some which ought to fail. But this can last only so long as the continuous rise of prices is not generally expected. Once people learn to count on it, even a continued rise of prices at the same rate will no longer exert the stimulus that it gave at first.</i><p>One might argue that we are seeing QE inflation, not in the direct economy, but in the investment market - property, stocks, bonds, anything traded not for short-term consumption, but for capital gains. I don&#x27;t have the data, so I don&#x27;t know.<p>Ultimately, it doesn&#x27;t matter if we have small amounts of inflation or deflation, or if we have no change in the money supply at all. <i>Expectations</i> are what matters - if the markets know that inflation will be 10% next year with 100% certainty, they will plan accordingly and prices/wages will rise accordingly (not perfectly as there will be some friction/lag, but better than if nobody knows what to expect inflation-wise). The problem occurs when nobody knows what the hell is going on in the market, and they keep waiting for the Fed to raise interest rates to get back to 2%, but are losing faith because the Fed has kept rates at 0% for 6 years (!) now. It&#x27;s all about unexpected shocks and how quickly the economy can adjust to new information.<p>Deflation is not to be feared if it is expected, announced, and executed by a central bank. It <i>is</i> to be feared when the central bank is fighting valiantly to bring about a favorable economic background in which they can raise interest rates without slowing down the recovery/growth of the economy. That&#x27;s when you know they&#x27;ve lost control, that everything is not ok in the financial markets, and when panic takes over.<p>[1] <a href=""https://mises.org/library/denationalisation-money-argument-refined"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mises.org/library/denationalisation-money-argument-r...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/Boarddocs/speeches/2003/20030325/default.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/Boarddocs/speeches/2003/200303...</a>",1445896305

It is an absolute theory that claims to apply everywhere.<p>I&#x27;ve been saying this theory is bunk for years, so it&#x27;s nice to finally see the view start to surface in mainstream publications. You only have to review the data to discover that there&#x27;s no empirical link between deflation and depression. For instance, take this paper, written by economists at the Minneapolis Fed:<p><a href=""https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr331.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr331.pdf</a><p>Abstract:<p><i>Are deflation and depression empirically linked? No, concludes a broad historical study of inflation and real output growth rates. Deflation and depression do seem to have been linked during the 1930s. But in the rest of the data for 17 countries and more than 100 years, there is virtually no evidence of such a link.</i><p>But you don&#x27;t really need data to convince yourself that the 2%-inflation-is-best theory is nonsense. Basic common sense should be good enough. The entire thing rests on the assumption that there&#x27;s a class of investments that people would refuse to invest in if left to their own devices, but which suddenly become attractive only if their savings are shrivelled by a few percent a year.

I understood it&#x27;s international standard practice to consider worst-case events from historical record spanning thousands of years in nuclear plant risk analysis, and it is known that almost as strong earthquakes hit Japan in 1933 (M=8.5) and 869 (M=8.6), for example. A plant by a different company just 100 km north of Dai-ichi was built for a 13-meter tsunami, so there was little consistency in what preparations the tsunami analysis actually induced, and the regulator seems to have been indifferent to these disparities. Further, there were for some reason no mandatory &quot;safety margins&quot; in tsunami level precautions to offset modelling inaccuracies, unlike in precautions for the earthquake ground shock – eventhough computational models for tsunami levels were and remain much less accurate than the ground shock models.<p>Although by 2000s the shortcomings of tsunami analysis like the one done for Dai-ichi were already well-known, a methodologically-flawed further analysis by TEPCO in 2010 failed to introduce any new recommendations – against the published opinions of their own scientists. The cost of relocating the diesel generators higher up in the building would have been just in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, rather than millions.",1445896148

Since then, I have started working on a similar effort to address the issue of API credentials on developer machines. I looked into using STS too, but the issue I kept coming back to was that if a malicious third party (MTP) obtains the developer&#x27;s machine and it is turned on and logged in (ie, ignore HDD encryption and assume they got the credential somehow), then the MTP can use the same workflow as the engineer to obtain access to the production system, right?<p>I suppose we need to clearly define the attack vector that we are trying to prevent. If we define the attack vector to be a MTP using developer credentials to obtain access to the production environment for any amount of time, then does aws-vault address that use-case?<p>If the long lived credentials on the developer box only have permission to request short lived creds from STS which have greater permissions, then I understand how that is certainly better than the MTP having long lived creds with greater permissions. But, how much better is it really? If the creds have IAM permissions, then the MTP could use the temporary creds to lock everyone else out except the root account.<p>I suppose the article is trying to make the point that the short lived credentials need to have appropriate permissions for the task which the developer needs to complete on a regular basis? Even so, someone somewhere needs to have creds which can modify IAM so that we can manage users, right?<p>I feel like I am talking myself into a rabbit hole here. Can anyone pull me out? I think/hope that I am missing something obvious and I&#x27;m hoping that the answer is &quot;we&#x27;re not solving everything, but we are reducing the attack surface&quot;.<p>Thoughts?",1445896101

That doesn&#x27;t mean the Chilean people are in any way lesser than the Koreans, but that they need to invest in what produces real value in 21st century - brains.<p>There is really not much to be gained for Israel by colonizing areas of Palestine, except better security (which is an economic bonus in itself). What I do wonder though - if Israel is magically relocated to an island nation, say in the middle of a trade route like Singapore, what would they be really capable of, unhindered by defensive considerations.",1445894893

They think the only signalling channel available to human beings is prices.<p>This model of capitalism only produces the best outcome if the people making decisions can observe the costs of the outcomes of their decisions.<p>Let&#x27;s say a super powerful alien has planted a bomb on the earth that will destroy the whole planet.  It then tells the whole of humanity that certain actions they take will count down the bomb, but the bomb only updates it&#x27;s counter once every hundred years. The bomb has a quite large counter, so it not really known when doomsday is.<p>The world&#x27;s scientists, even politicians, authenticate and acknowledge the alien&#x27;s message. However, since the true date of doomsday can&#x27;t be determined, and the connection between actions and the bomb don&#x27;t update the clock for 100 years, it is hard to convince anyone to change their economic activity.<p>That is, it is hard to PRICE-IN the new information about the bomb even though the knowledge is available. Thus, even when concrete knowledge is available, people will make time-preference decisions to defer the pricing until later generations when it reaches a crisis rather than amortizing it over time. This is perfectly rational, but it also leads to globally non-optimal solutions.<p>I consider myself a libertarian and fully believe that capitalism is the best system for free people to optimally allocate resources given a set of constraints.<p>When I don&#x27;t believe is that the only way these constraints should be imposed is by purely &quot;natural&quot; means. Like if a fire or asteroid strike destroyed a critical natural resource, the price would rise and Austrians would say the new price is a fine and natural response to the new constraint. But if the government were to impose a tax on the resource to raise it&#x27;s price similarly in order to limit it&#x27;s use, somehow that&#x27;s not ok.<p>Capitalism has unfactored costs because property rights can&#x27;t be applied everywhere, or the coordination cost of some property rights are too high.  Ergo, these cause distortions in the market.  Thus, I favor a mixed economy. A mostly capitalistic society that acts through collaboration to reign in egregious externalities. (BTW, those just don&#x27;t include environmental externalities, but also externalities that come from human costs, for example, the costs of inequality, poverty, illiteracy, etc)<p>That so many people find even minimal social welfare or regulation disagreeable I find rather confusing.  I mean, if you agree that you should pay for the use of property, and that usage fees should be paid for usage of common infrastructure of property, then why throw a hissy fit over say, gas or carbon taxes? Isn&#x27;t your car spewing exhaust an initialization of force against me since I have to breath it? Shouldn&#x27;t you have to pay a usage free to dump into the atmosphere which you don&#x27;t own? How can it be justified that there should be no regulation of this when tort is impossible against the individual actors?",1445894890

And why do so with such unhelpful criticisms? And do you think the team that built this had anything but a huge net loss in opportunity cost? $11k is an above average software engineer&#x27;s monthly take home. This was built in at least a few months with several engineers.<p>If the UI is laughably bad, surely it should be easy to list out some constructive criticisms rather than disparaging insults? I will offer some:<p>1. One defense of the default UI is that in bl.ocks.org, most examples are shown with the visualization on top and the code on the bottom. Maybe they were trying to offer a similar experience, but I agree it doesn&#x27;t make sense as the code will almost always be longer in height than the output it creates. Side by side should be the default view, and the code should be on the left, output on the right.<p>2. The inability to resize the code view when in side by side mode (clicking on the ying yang), is also frustrating.<p>3. The home / about / gallery menu in the top left feels incomplete. It needs styling and a proper home. It feels like it was just stitched on.<p>4. Having the video seems like an okay idea but I think most people are used to in browser editors at this point and don&#x27;t need a video explanation. The UI should speak for itself in this regard. You could have some instructions commented out in the editor for how to get started, but that&#x27;s it.<p>5. Borrow from others: jsbin, codepen, jsfiddle...<p>Overall, I think this could be a really helpful tool and this is a strong prototype. The UI needs some work but the core functionality works well, and I like that I don&#x27;t have to rerun the code to see the output.",1445894594

Even General LeMay thought he was unstable and aggressive, and LeMay himself was the guy who oversaw the war against the Japanese Home Islands.  When the guy who burned the best part of a million people alive with firebombings and then nuked the remains thinks you&#x27;re a bit of a loose cannon, well...<p>He is often viewed as the likely inspiration for Gen. Buck Turgidson in the film Dr. Strangelove.  A quote from Power, when the RAND Corporation raised the proposal of a counterforce strike instead of striking at Soviet cities:<p><pre><code>  &quot;Restraint? Why are you so concerned with saving their lives? The whole idea\n  is to kill the bastards. At the end of the war if there are two Americans \n  and one Russian left alive, we win!&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIn the words of Gen. Horace Wade, a subordinate who served under Gen Powers:<p><pre><code>  I used to worry about General Power. I used to worry that General Power \n  was not stable. I used to worry about the fact that he had control over\n  so many weapons and weapon systems and could, under certain conditions,\n  launch the force. Back in the days before we had real positive control \n  [i.e., PAL locks], SAC had the power to do a lot of things, and it\n  was in his hands, and he knew it.\n</code></pre>\nSAC pushed back very strongly against this intrusion.  The first Permissive Action Links were installed in 1959 and the bulk of them in 1962, but the 8-digit security codes were set to &quot;0000 0000&quot; until around 1977, because SAC was afraid that they would be unable to fire the weapons if needed.<p>It&#x27;s a goddamn miracle we didn&#x27;t go over the edge, either accidentally or with those guys at the controls.  In one case, a B-52 crashed in North Carolina in 1961.  The bomb went through its full arming sequence, being stopped only by a single low-voltage switch.  That switch later became known for being unreliable and failing to interrupt its signal properly.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_Goldsboro_B-52_crash"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_Goldsboro_B-52_crash</a><p>The Russians had some close calls of their own, notably when the sun glinted off the clouds and tripped their launch warnings during ABLE ARCHER 83.",1445894337

Just make sure it does not cancel out his own inputs.<p>He is the center of his life. He has knowledge he cannot convey to you. That knowledge influences his decisions. Just because he cannot articulate it does not mean it is unimportant.<p>So, let&#x27;s take a simple example: He dislikes a particular shirt. Perhaps it is his only wool shirt and perhaps he has a mild, unrecognized wool allergy. He can tell you he doesn&#x27;t like the shirt and doesn&#x27;t want to wear it. He cannot tell you why in a way that is defensible if you require him to justify his choice.<p>Expose him to good things and lots of options. But try to let him pick and choose. Try to resist the temptation to decide what he should or should not like.<p>I used to think video games were drivel, brain rot, no good would come of it. My mother kept sending them, my sons kept playing them. My sons now want to make video games and I have been won over. That occurred because I left some space for them to make decisions about their own lives and some room for the possibility that I did not know everything and was not always right.<p>The innate intelligence of small children gets overlooked, ignored and dismissed simply because they aren&#x27;t as educated and articulate as the adults, so they cannot defend their preferences. Assume his preferences exist for a reason. Don&#x27;t automatically dismiss them just because you are better than he is at articulating why you think something is or is not a good choice.<p>I hope that makes more sense. Happy parenting and best of luck.",1445893246

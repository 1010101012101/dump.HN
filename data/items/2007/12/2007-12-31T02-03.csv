The author, Terry Tao, is a mathematician at UCLA, and won both a Fields Medal and the MacArthur ""genius"" grant in 2006.  He went to the International Mathematics Olympiad when he was 10 years old.  He specializes in number theory, harmonic analysis, combinatorics, and making people like me feel stupid.",1199069633

93798,comment,93683,93733,0,0,mhartl,,,"It is possible!  Negative temperatures are perfectly well-defined (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_temperature"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_temperature</a>).  In fact, they are <i>higher</i> than positive temperatures.  There is a discontinuity in the traditional temperature system at 0, and the <i>highest</i> possible temperature is 0-, i.e., zero approached from the left.  The lowest temperature (the traditional ""absolute zero"") is 0+.<p>Perhaps a more sensible system is one that uses \beta = -1/kT to measure temperature, where k is Boltzmann's constant.  This temperature scale runs from -infinity to +infinity, with no discontinuities.<p>-2147483648 is still probably a bug, though.  :-)",1199068852

But schooling should definitely be reformed, and people are right to criticize it.<p>The anecdote about your personal experience is, of course, irrelevant. It <i>seemed</i> to help you, but we don't know if it did or not compared to alternatives you did not experience.<p>I agree that being able to deal with bullshit is a marketable skill. But surely it is not a path everyone should take. And it is a way of life we should wish to become less common and less useful.",1199066901

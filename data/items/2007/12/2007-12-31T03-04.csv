They recently covered the Hexayurt Project, however, and I was not impressed - a bunch of braying jackals who hadn't RTFA screaming their ignorance in public. So even Mefi is on the decline, apparently, at least in the comments. The front page is still pretty decent.<p>But that, really, is the key: you need to stop adding posters when the site is cool and hip, to draw out the period in which the site is providing early-adopter content.<p>Moderation systems won't do it: they get swamped by bad moderators over time, witness slashdot's meta-moderation corrective.<p>Good luck.",1199073065

93809,comment,93537,93754,0,0,vitaminj,,,"Yes agree completely. I've long been in favour of bringing back the apprenticeship system for professionals (in conjunction with tertiary education) - well at least for engineering.<p>In Australia, we used to have this - as an engineering cadet, you worked for a company while going to uni as well. Not only can you directly apply what you learn at work, but there is also a motivational factor for learning (seeing as you have a practical context for the theory). <p>A personal anecdote - I remember learning about generators and power transformers and thinking what the hell do these things even look like? It wasn't until I graduated that I actually saw them in action. I still feel that if I was actually working on them then, I'd certainly have had more incentive / motivation to learn. As it was, I had to go back and re-learn everything on the job. I've spoken to many other engineers and graduates since, and most have agreed and had similar experiences.<p>Universities were traditionally a feeder system for research and academia (and learning for the sake of learning), but these days it has become a prerequisite for industry. Clearly there is some misalignment between the needs of industry and academia.",1199071815

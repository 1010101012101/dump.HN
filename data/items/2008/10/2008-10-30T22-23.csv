It's people like you who fuck things up for the rest of us. You're a shitty piece of scum. And yes, I think my saying that on HN is appropriate: you're pushing known lies on the rest of us. (Comparing Obama to Hitler? Honestly? That is, if you did indeed link to the correct comment, which I'll repost and debunk below.)<p><i>American turning it self into a third world country,</i>
I'd suggest you look up what exactly a third-world country is.<p><i>By Electing a man ""Barack Obama"" who straight out supporting KNowN Terrorist, this is just a Fact now</i>
No he hasn't.<p><i>Los Angeles Times has a video of Barack obama supporting a torrorist and toasting him, on Video</i>
Not quite, no.<p><i>To many facts there, THe left wing like Pelosi and many other Or trying to stop this tape from getting out, </i>
No, they haven't. If you mean Bill Ayers, Obama has addressed this matter specifically. He's hiding nothing.<p><i>If it was Hillary or JOhn McCain, you can rest assure this tape would already be out, But more facts MSM is suppressing this video,</i>
The video that has been on every news network? MSNBC had a story specifically about this.<p><i>Like so many third world Dictators in other country, Who control the Media, CNN, MSnbc , los angeles times, New york times, So many other Medias </i>
Yet... when people write good things about McCain, that's considered free speech? What?<p><i>WHo trying to elect a Man who supports Terrorist,
Barack Obama,</i>
Still no.<p><i>No one calling Barack a terrorist, but he sure does support them, </i>
No he doesn't.<p><i>His Track record is sure proving this, ,, Rev Wright, Ayers, Rezko Barack Obama sure love surrounding his self with Crminals,</i>
Despite the Ayers claims being thoroughly debunked? Or the Rezko incident being entirely minimal? Or do you mean Wright, who Obama not only denounced but whom - in my opinion - actually made a good set of points in his speech?<p><i>Hitler started out this way, Going after the simple Young crowd, to elect them,,then after he is elected its to late, the country in turmoil, and lost, History has proven this, </i>
Every politician uses the same tactics. Lincoln did this. Washington did this. Sometimes people elected in times of crisis do good things.<p><i>Why do you think Barack Obama created his own Seal,</i>
You mean the seal of Ohio, which looks like an O?<p><i>Why do you think he is trying to make this country a Socialist country,</i>
By supporting the same progressive taxes McCain is on the record as supporting?<p><i>ALL the signs are there, Bias Media, criminal as friend,</i>
Huh. Sounds a lot like McCain and Fox.<p><i>the man has no real agenda</i>
The man with a 200-page documented agenda? Or McCain, whose entire site is becoming an Anti-Obama site with nothing Pro-McCain on record?<p><i>and for the simple fact, Barack Obama has his Own News Station, to get the lies out there,, THat News Station is Msnbc, Followed by CNN, the 2 most bias News media stations,</i>
Hmm.

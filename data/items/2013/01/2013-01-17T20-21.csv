5075148,comment,5074503,5075001,1,0,knwang,,,"Typically there are 3 use cases for email services - transactional emails, campaign emails and receiving emails. You have the most options with it comes to sending transactional emails. But pay attention to some of the lower priced providers because they only help you to ""send"" emails, but not putting much effort that the emails are actually delivered - it is hard engineering with all the email provider's spam rules etc. The ones I recommend in this area are Mailgun and Postmark. Both have good reputation doing this well.<p>Then you have inbounding emails, which is newer and less providers do that. Both Mailgun and Postmark have it, and there are some newer players like cloudmailin, which I haven't used.<p>On the campaigning side, the biggest player is MailChimp with good reputation. I have used their service, but it feels like it's mostly built for marketers - Nice UI, a lot of templating choices, and your workflow is mostly in the browser. If that's your use case, they should serve you well.<p>As for as I know, Mailgun is the only email provider that has all 3, plus Mailing Lists and Storage (you can create mail boxes.. or basically build your own version of GMail on top of Mailgun).. For Tealeaf Academy (<a href=""http://www.gotealeaf.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gotealeaf.com</a>), we use delivering, receiving, mailing lists and campaigning, so Mailgun is what we picked. It also has a ""closer to the metal"" feel with their lower level APIs, which we like a lot.<p>I'd also recommend Postmark, if your app focuses on delivering and receiving transactional emails, and their pricing makes sense to you - I have seen some of their developer's posts and they know this stuff very well too.<p>I'd avoid some of the cheaper options, especially on transactional email delivery - it's a big deal (sending people receipts, notify credit card expiration, resetting password etc) and you want to stick with people who know how to do this.. don't cheap out",1358456168

Because when the maximum penalty after a trial is a 30 day misdemeanor, you hire a lawyer and pay them two months of your salary and you make your case, because that's about the point past where spending more money to defend the case is no longer worth it against the possibility of losing.<p>But when the maximum penalty is a 30 year felony, or even a 10 year felony, you spend every dime you have, because the penalties are <i>that</i> high. And then, because criminals are so consistently charged with enormous penalties like that, which makes them consistently go all out on their defenses, the prosecutors go to Congress and say ""we don't have enough resources to fight these people who have these high priced defense attorneys"" and they get multimillion dollar budgets for individual cases.<p>Which brings on the arms race. So now you're not just spending every dime <i>you</i> have, you're spending every dime your parents have, every dime your friends have to prove that you didn't do it, every cent you can borrow from a bank or a loan shark, because the alternative is even worse. And the more defendants spend, the more prosecutors get to outspend them, because ""we can't have criminals with more resources than prosecutors.""<p>Scale back the stakes and you scale back the resources needed to fight over them.",1358455630

It would have saved me a few years of misery.<p>I'm not here to be your friend. My post is laying out reality for you whether you appreciate that or not. The simple fact of the matter is that the person doing the interviews is interviewing many more people than you are attending interviews. As I said - Know your role.<p>Keep in mind that all the people over 35 have probably faced the same situations you will face in your first 5 years of employment <i>numerous times</i>. That means that although they don't have all the answers, they do have the benefit of having actually lived through several outcomes. This counts. A lot. You do not have this perspective. Understand this and you will go far. Refuse to accept it and you'll likely make the same mistakes they did.<p><i>Knowing some people doesn't make you a badass. You are a nothing who knows some people. Big deal.</i><p>I don't see where I said that at all. I said knowing people (assuming knowing also means ""receiving respect from"") opens doors. Not knowing people keeps these doors inaccessible to you. Don't bitch at me, this is simply the way the world works. If you haven't figured that out yet, you're in for a world of issues.<p><i>Anyone who wants to work with nice, cooperative people will avoid any shop which represents itself in this absolutely toxic way</i><p>And anyone that wants to work period will understand that utopia is a myth. I'm not seeing my generation under-employed and serving lattes at Startbucks because filing is ""beneath them"" or ""the company asks riddles at the interview"". You aren't in a position to dictate your terms (yet). More importantly, <i>you'll never get to such a position if you don't understand this now!</i><p>There are times in life to be humble and deal with stupid riddles, bureaucracy, stupid policies and yes, even the asshole boss. When you are young and starting out is probably the textbook example. You can bitch and moan about how the world is awful and life isn't fair or call people that don't support your worldview assholes, as children do, or you can understand that you are once again at the bottom and work a little bit harder, a little bit longer, producing a little bit better results than your peers, and move up the chain a little.<p>Your choice, not mine. As I said, I'm in a different world now. I can (and have) walked away from things I don't like, been poached by other companies, and don't remember the last time I actually responded to a job ad.

5074962,comment,5073487,5074565,11,0,jerf,,,"I'm learning Go to evaluate whether I want to try to use it at work. After using Erlang, Python's gevent, and Haskell, each quite substantially for concurrency (though to varying degrees, Erlang the most), I'm finding Go's concurrency constructs to be by far the most dangerous of the four. It's not even close. Go is the only one with synchronization on the message sending, and I'm trying to keep an open mind on the utility of that, but so far it mostly seems to have the effect of turning valid code in any other system into a deadlock in Go, for the purpose of avoiding putative problems in asynchronous sending that just don't seem to happen in practice in the other environments.<p>(By open mind, I mean that I acknowledge that I have years of being steeped in an asynchronous message passing environment and that I may need to unlearn some things and learn others. I'm a polyglot programmer, so this isn't my first time for that, either. There are some some useful things that Go's channel style is easier to work with than Erlang's style. Still, right now I'm cautiously negative on the net utility of that, even so.)<p>I've deadlocked Erlang twice in many years. It didn't make it to production either time. I deadlocked Go twice in the first two days, and several times since. (And Go terminates the entire process upon deadlock.) And what really concerns me in terms of recommending it for work is that while I instantly understood how I deadlocked Go, it was only because of the fact that I'm fairly experienced now in reasoning with these sorts of advanced concurrency constructs. Many of my coworkers would have been stuck for hours.<p>It's not out of the running yet, considering many of its positive qualities and the competition it is up against, but the Unambiguous Win I was hoping for is not emerging. (Many of these issues may be avoidable with style; for instance, one can write goroutines that manage resources in a fairly Erlang-y style and which are services that have a continuous receive-reply loop, and those are safe enough. But I'd really rather have more compiler support here rather than depending on convention; that's how we got to the realization that conventional threads are a bad idea in the first place.)",1358454233

I say this very literally, that I rather be homeless in San Francisco than live anywhere around it. Its an amazing city that has given me a lot (and taken a lot in a fair trade). The most amazing aspect of this city, in my opinion, is that its where all the American 'rejects' end up in. In those years the start up scene was different than today and not everybody around you was in a start up. But most of those who were not native and not in a start up were those that didn't quite fit in in their home state and though they'd find acceptance in San Francisco. Most of them did. Its probably one of the most tolerant city in the States where most people there have a passport and are well travelled. Yes its expensive, but you do get what you pay for.

For example, here is one of the most relevant parts:<p>""We need to take stuff thats out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. <i>We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks</i>.""<p>Now here's the funny thing: The first two arguably aren't illegal or infringing. If something is out of copyright then you can copy it. If you interpret buying a secret database as actually buying the distribution rights to it, neither is that. And if you read it in that context, you can imagine circumstances in which the same could be done to journals in specific circumstances, e.g. as a call for academics or their universities to retain their copyright so that they could do so with authorization, or with the subset of journals that charge for access but still allow liberal redistribution by those who have paid, etc. On the other hand, he's talking about civil disobedience, which implies lawbreaking. It's a conflicted piece.<p>So you have that, and then you have the fact that he was known to do work on text processing that may require a large corpus of articles for a database, which provides a rational alternative justification for downloading the articles other than to post them to file sharing networks -- or perhaps he intended to do that and also post that subset of the articles downloaded which could legally be posted, either because they're in the public domain or were appropriately licensed.<p>The point is we don't know, and the prosecution has the burden to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. So even if you think it's more likely than not that he would have posted them all to Pirate Bay, do you think so beyond a reasonable doubt?

It's more like disaster preparation. Save as much as possible, live as far below your means as you can handle, keep your skills valuable. Keep your money diversified and expect your returns to just about keep up with the real and honest cost of living increases until the world economy feels like taking a dramatic shift for the better. We're still ""unwinding"" from all the previous crises so I don't foresee that happening anytime soon.",1358453054

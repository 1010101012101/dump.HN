Touches like this are what elevate software from merely functional to great.<p>Maniacal attention to detail is what separates the great from the merely good enough.  Examples?

The old ""if this concerns you, you're done - ship it"" doesn't really cover what's going on here. <p>If this was the most attractive potential feature from an ROI perspective, you're not just done, you sold the company years ago and you're sitting on the beach sipping cocktails, thinking up crazy side projects with the sole purpose of reassuring yourself how pitiful the burn rate is compared to the interest on your vast piles of cash.

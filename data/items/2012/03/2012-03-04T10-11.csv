In all other respects the language is very, very concerned with being able to drill down to the native features of each platform and achieve as native an experience as possible given the constraints of a garbage-collecting, dynamic/static mixed, classy OO language design.",1330858287

3662513,comment,3662350,3662350,8,0,suresk,,,"The post was a little disjointed, but there were two things I wanted to comment on:<p>1) Just build stuff.<p>I think this, by itself, is pretty good advice. I've built a lot of websites and apps, and while I haven't gained a lot of notoriety or huge financial success from them, they have all been huge educational experiences for me, and are a big part of the reason I have such a good job (and good opportunities) right now.<p>I'll keep building stuff because I find it intrinsically rewarding and educational, and because I figure the more stuff I build, the better the chance that one of them will turn into something bigger.<p>2) Don't get a CS degree.<p>I cringe when I see stuff like that. This was me a little over a decade ago when I was planning for college. I had the grades and test scores to study CS at Stanford, MIT, or any other well-respected school and for a variety of reasons (that don't make much sense to the 29 year old version of me) chose to study Finance at a few state universities instead.<p>Finance was interesting, and I got to do an internship at a VC fund as a result of it, but ultimately, not studying CS has been a major regret of mine. I feel like I'm a pretty competent and successful software developer now, but I can't help but wonder how many more opportunities would have been available to me had I gone the CS route (or at least Physics, Math, or Engineering) instead.<p>It certainly is worth thinking about whether you really want to go the CS route, but don't write it off because you feel like you can simply learn it all along the way.",1330857972

She had a medical condition which required surgery, but due to her age, she was not eligible in France, so she had to come to the US for her surgery.

Even with object files (or source) they'd have to pay to register as an iOS developer.<p>I suspect the majority of developers using the LGPL don't realise, or perhaps even agree, with this intent, so you're probably unlikely to be sued, but it's what the license demands.",1330857462

There are a lot of people who can't form abstractions or pay enough attention to detail to be able to program. People either get it (and can become great at it) or they don't (they will fail their programming classes and/or give up).

At what point can one assume that a 'handshake deal' has taken place, and is that point really the same for both parties?  e.g Is it literally a handshake and the words ""We're going ahead with this!""  Or could it be more vague where one party thinks there's a deal but the other's not so sure.<p>You've said that deals exist to fall through and that ""The key to closing deals is never to stop pursuing alternatives ... don't believe it till you get the check.""

The deal might <i>still</i> fall through but the intent to close is more explicit.<p>Aside: Mark says <i>""... so I thought they should take the deal""</i>, which implied to me that <i>not</i> taking the deal was still a valid option. i.e. no handshake.<p>[1] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html</a>)",1330856980

Certainly in the UK, it's pretty easy to send an SMS with any name (text or number) you want in place of the phone number. And I suspect that most people aren't that tech-smart to realise that a text claiming to be from T-Mobile isn't actually from them.",1330855863

Apparently, several government labs are working on a small, portable thorium reactor that would be great for this type of thing.  The SSTAR[2] (small, sealed, transportable, autonomous reactor) system will produce 10 to 100 megawatts electric and can be safely transported on ship or by a heavy-haul transport truck.

It doesn't have to be in any particular form.<p>Online portfolios, open source, blogs, etc. can work very well - but they're just modes of expression. Some people take to them very well and use them very effectively, and that's great. But not everyone needs to have a coding blog. It's just one arrow in the quiver, and you should focus your time and attention wherever it will give optimal results <i>for you.</i>",1330855645

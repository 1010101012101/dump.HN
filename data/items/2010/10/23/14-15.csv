If things went wrong in this situation at worse he'd have a car in a worse state and the man in the pickup could have died if the barrier made him topple over. The probability of the pick-up  going into traffic again (which would make the car in front collide with the barrier, which could be fatal) was really small... hell uuid duplicate probability small at that.",1287845987

Searching was slow, but printing was even slower. I installed a print spooler so I could get more done and not stress. The higher ups were impressed with my productivity and wanted me to quit school and go full-time, which I declined. Some full time peers were jealous, realized what I did and complained to the IT department. I was let go for installing unauthorized software when the real issue was setting a higher bar for performance.",1287845749

1823590,comment,1822847,1822847,0,0,burningion,,,"Free College Hack:<p>In high school, I had a rough time with family stuff and my grades started to slack. I knew that getting a scholarship would be crucial if I wanted to go to college in the future. However, my grades simply weren't going to cut it for the Florida Lottery Bright Futures scholarship. I needed a 3.5+ GPA, a 1250+ SAT score, and 60 hours of community service in order to get their best 100% scholarship.<p>At the rate I was going, my GPA wouldn't be near that.<p>So I did some research, and I found out that the Bright Futures Scholarship was also applicable to home schooled students. Intrigued, I researched a bit into what made up a home schooled student's GPA.<p>I found a legal loophole here. One of the ways that the State of Florida graded home schooled students was by letting them talk to a psychologist. The psychologist said you were performing at a grade level, and you graduated. Grades were simply ""made up"".<p>So I dropped out of high school end of sophomore year, and created my own home schooled program. Which basically consisted of building a boat, programming, and volunteering at ECHO (echonet.org)<p>In dropping out, I basically had two years to practice taking the SAT's in order to get above a 1270. I scored a 1280 and got a 100% free ride into any State school.<p>But by the time I'd spent 2 years out of the educational system, I'd decided a year of living in the rain forest would be better than partying at school. So I turned down the scholarship and moved to the Panamanian rain forest instead.",1287845618

1823578,comment,1822376,1823400,0,0,rwmj,,,"Thanks for replying.<p>The 64 bit issue is definitely not the ""same for all languages"".  Programs get slightly bigger, but don't double in size as happens for Python programs.  Most Linux 64 bit C programs will be using 32 bit 'int'.  Python consumes 24 bytes to store any single int on 64 bit.<p>Code generators: I mean ones which anyone uses.<p>Lack of type safety: it may well be ""by design"", but it's a dumb design which causes lots of problems.  Search Bugzilla for Python tracebacks and you'll see hundreds of bugs caused by lack of basic compile-time type checks.  It's <i>easy</i> for a compiler to check that a function you're calling requires 3 arguments of type foo, bar and baz, and not doing that simply causes lots of errors.<p>The whitespace issue is also real: if/else changes its meaning completely if you're not hyper-careful about how you apply patches (especially when you have to make manual fixes to patches to get them to apply).",1287845285

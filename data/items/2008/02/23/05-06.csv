That way, your employees will have to own up to any wasted time instead of find ways to circumvent it. It's also a good accountability program for your employees.<p>This idea just came to mind. Do you guys think something like this would work?<p>As far as your original question goes, I don't know of anything off the top of my head, but you could always get a sort of parental guardian box the plugs in between your router and your internet connection. Those usually have a block by site function built into them, as well as password protecting certain sites (you know, if you want to bypass your own security to get to HN or whatever).",1203745533

121861,comment,121649,121820,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Actually I think it makes more sense if you don't report pledges as a monetary amount (at least not directly). It feels a bit like a rip off when the real amount is inevitably lower and any potential users is going to be trying to do the conversion rates for any figure they see. A user report might say you got 100 pledges and $5 this week.<p>Already a lot of people are worried about people tipping and absconding - I think you should redefine the way people think about your tips: its a way of showing your appreciation which you can convert into real money at convenient times. Don't fight the people who want to show appreciation and not pony up the cash, and don't fight with bloggers to see the pledge amounts as real dollar amounts when they won't be.",1203743901

7036851,comment,7036205,7036205,3,0,jrub,,,"Buying likes (beyond a certain point) anymore is largely an outdated methodology. Once you&#x27;ve got a significant number of likes for your Page on Facebook (which is kind of a case-by-case number, depending on your brand, business, demographic, etc) you don&#x27;t need to focus as much as building an audience.<p>Facebook has released a wealth of tools via their advertising platform in the last 12 months that make serving ads to the users you want to reach a much easier prospect. You don&#x27;t need a super-large 2 million user base Page in order to get the word about your product out. Granted, you do have to pay for distribution now, instead of a few years ago when it was free, but the tools that are available (ad units, targeting, etc) are vastly better than what was available 2-3 years ago.<p>So, the article is correct in it&#x27;s denouncing the value of a &quot;like&quot; on FB, but that value was always due to drop. Having more fans early on in the days of Pages was the main indicator of the success that a brand was having on FB. Those days are long gone, and [FB] marketers have to be more intelligent and deliberate about their strategies, and they have to be willing to put their money where their mouth is.",1389365967

So if I got it right, the difference between branch based and trunk based style is how long you let your branches to develop, both in time and commits. The one extreme is a branch for the whole release and the other is a &quot;branch&quot; for just a one commit. Feature branches would be something in between.<p>Now the problem with long branches and painful merges sounds like a communication problem between the <i>master</i> and the <i>branch</i>, just at the level of the code. We know that at the level of people timely and terse communication is key to a successful project. So the same would kinda make sense at the code level too.",1389365895

7036812,comment,7035110,7035448,3,0,adelevie,,,"> Look at Penn State for a prime example of toxic &quot;athletics are everything&quot; college football culture.<p>> Look at the numerous recruitment scandals in which players or players&#x27; families were offered money or perks in exchange for matriculation.<p>I graduated from Penn State in 2011--the year before the Sandusky scandal broke. It was easily the darkest time for my school, and I don&#x27;t know a single person who wasn&#x27;t feeling a mix of horror, shame, and disgust at what went on. While the connection between the football program and Sandusky&#x27;s actions (a retired coach since 1998) leaves room for disagreement amongst reasonable people, Penn State is one of the few schools that handles student athleticism properly. Recruiting scandals, perks from boosters, and lackluster academic achievement from student athletes are problems that Penn State solves as well as any school out there.<p>The New America Foundation ranks top-25-BCS-ranked football programs by academic achievement of their players. Anytime Penn State&#x27;s football team was ranked in the top 25 in the BCS, they have also ranked highly (usually #1) in New America&#x27;s &quot;Academic Bowl&quot;.[1]<p>I&#x27;d also like to point out the fascinating example set by John Urschel. He finished his math undergrad degree in three years with a 4.0 GPA[2]. He then finished his math masters degree the following year, again with a 4.0 GPA[3]. He has written academic research articles[4]. He writes software[5]. He teaches an undergrad math course[6]. He&#x27;s also a graduating offensive lineman with a real shot at the NFL. He&#x27;s weighing that prospect against the option of pursuing a Ph.D[7].<p>[1] <a href""http://higheredwatch.newamerica.net/blogposts/2012/the_2012_academic_bowl_championship_series-7517"" rel""nofollo"">http://higheredwatch.newamerica.net/blogposts/2012/the_2012_...</a>, <a href""http://higheredwatch.newamerica.net/blogposts/2009/third_annual_academic_bowl_championship_series_rankings-2525"" rel""nofollo"">http://higheredwatch.newamerica.net/blogposts/2009/third_ann...</a>, <a href""http://www.newamerica.net/blog/higher-ed-watch/2008/second-annual-academic-bcs-rankings-890"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.newamerica.net/blog/higher-ed-watch/2008/second-a...</a><p>[2] <a href""http://www.personal.psu.edu/jcu5018/cv.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.personal.psu.edu/jcu5018/cv.html</a><p>[3] Id.<p>[4] Id.<p>[5] <a href""http://www.personal.psu.edu/jcu5018/publications.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.personal.psu.edu/jcu5018/publications.html</a><p>[6] <a href""http://www.personal.psu.edu/jcu5018/cv.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.personal.psu.edu/jcu5018/cv.html</a><p>[7] <a href""http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/sportsman/news/20131204/john-urschel-my-sportsman"" rel""nofollo"">http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/sportsman/news/20131204/joh...</a>",1389365510

7036657,comment,7035030,7035673,33,0,bhauer,,,"Thank you for the reality-check.  I really do appreciate it and hope anyone reading my words reads yours as counterpoint.<p>I had tried to be fair-handed with my judgment of the Seiki but I admit that my desire for large form-factor displays coupled with Seiki delivering one that I can actually afford clouds my judgment some.  I want high-quality large displays and the incumbent manufacturers have left me in the cold for a decade.<p>Not that it matters, but one area where I spoil myself is in monitors.  I spend what I can afford (and then some, admittedly) on monitors in lieu of other luxuries.  I own five 30&quot; monitors, three of which are Dell U3011s.  I love those monitors.  As you point out, they ship from the factory with great color, a matte screen, and of course inputs that don&#x27;t disappoint.<p>But on the flip-side, the 30&quot; &quot;professional&quot; LCD monitor as exemplified by the Dell U3011 and U3014 has not decreased in price substantially since I picked up my first Dell 3007WFP, what was it, eight years ago?<p>Maybe it&#x27;s telling that I have not yet replaced one of my home Dell monitors with a Seiki.  But when my wife&#x27;s Dell 30&quot; died, we decided to give the Seiki a try.  As I&#x27;ve said, the Seiki has several downsides.  The 30Hz lag is foremost.  It&#x27;s noticeable and frustrating.  But the screen size and delight of having so many pixels in a single display is so compelling.  Also, after applying the Seiki firmware update, the backlight can be adjusted, allowing for better calibration.<p>It&#x27;s not a perfect monitor.  It&#x27;s not even a <i>great</i> monitor.  It&#x27;s a good monitor and it does the thing I value most: give me pixels with which to see and interact with information quickly.  As a programmer on a budget, it&#x27;s my favorite monitor currently available.  I really hope that competition heats up and better monitors are on the horizon.  I will bite at opportunities to get large, high-DPI, high-quality, high-speed displays.<p>But for now, I personally would not buy the Dell 30&quot; unless they severely cut the price.

Professional football did not start in the US until many years later.

Things have spiraled out of control from there. Many schools now face very serious pressure from alumni and other donors who demand athletic success. Recruiting top high school athletes is an extremely shady business, as both schools and athletes have a lot at stake.<p>Harvard, Yale, and the other Ivy League schools today do not do this to the extent that some others do and have policies against awarding scholarships based on athletics-- they are small and elite institutions that can&#x27;t get away with admitting students who literally cannot read.

So the finite supply is not a concern at even $1m/coin.<p>2) Global acceptance will have an important part in making it go mainstream. Right now, online/office vendors have started accepting bitcoins but thats too little, just like how paypal was in its initial days and compared to this, very very less business are accepting other crypto currencies. I know a lot of business who plan to start accepting crypto currencies soon and all of them mean bitcoin. So, why would other crypto currencies go mainstream when you can&#x27;t actually use them around the Internet?<p>3) No one would mind buying bitcoins at a higher price, eliminating the need for other crypto currencies.

I can&#x27;t keep this all in my head, and this is where having a large screen produces <i>noticeable</i> productivity improvements and speed improvements to problem solving.<p>It is not a matter of not being able to jump around the code instantly from my keyboard — I can do that easily. It is knowing and remembering <i>where</i> to go and <i>what</i> I&#x27;m supposed to be working on. It is trying to maintain context while handling the many hundreds of errors that come about due to the necessary integration, API and architectural changes.<p>When I have a large screen I can afford to maintain a long list of files in a column on the left, I can see more large files at once. This allows me to constantly refresh my memory. I can glance at the data in front of me to determine what symbol I need to jump to next. I often mentally blank out when dealing with this level of scale — that &quot;what was I about to edit?&quot; feeling. When I am only on my laptop screen I have to start pulling up code, tracing a path back through it to redevelop context. When I have a large screen I can (usually) rebuild this context by glancing at the existing information.<p>(Note that this is not a messy project, I have spent a long time and given very careful thought to its design. It is just large and necessarily complex because of what it has to do. A bigger screen makes it faster to develop large scale interactions in such a project.)<p>> <i>Was that necessary?</i><p>I&#x27;m sorry about that. It wasn&#x27;t.<p>> <i>What&#x27;s even better about the command line is that you can pipe input and output between applications.</i><p>I have nothing against the command line — I use it all the time. I just like to take the most efficient path when working and <i>sometimes</i> that is not the command line. But that is tangential to the large screen point above.<p>> <i>I do. I lack the sensory to monitor more than a couple metrics at once. I prefer profiling data that can be captured and analyzed later.</i><p>I had meant to ask if you analyse your profiling data on the command line. Do you?",1389363125

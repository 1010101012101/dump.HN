I mean, if you are a young single person, so you pay a grand for a studio rather than $500 in some flyover state.   or $600 for a room rather than $300.   Not really a big deal when your salary starts at $80K/year.<p>As you get older and want to buy a house and have a family?  Eh, during the bubble, it was a problem.   Five hundred grand for a 1bdroom condo?  crazy.   But these days?  rents might be high, but you can get a small 3bdroom house for $300-$350K in a very safe area.   By that point in your life, an Engineer's salary is going to be at least 1/3rd of that, which seems like a pretty reasonable ratio of salary to house.<p>I mean, yeah, if you can take a 20% paycut to live in a flyover state where you can get something giant and nice for $100K, that might look like a good deal on the face of it, but the thing is, here in the valley?  there is a multitude of employers to choose from.  If you are in idaho and your employer shuts down or you want to quit?  likely you are going to have to move.

3241287,comment,3239815,3240901,4,0,pnathan,,,"Thank you for your kind words.<p>Well, some people are lazy. There's no getting around that. Some people would rather take bong hits or play video games than turn in homework. I don't understand those people. Especially when (as some people have told me) they've done the homework.<p>I think usually in 'lazy' cases the laziness is because they don't care about the bad grade or the lack of learning. The canonical stereotype is the frat boy with his parents paying his way. Stereotype's priorities are not aligned with seeking a degree. They are aligned with parties or making sure parents are happy. So they have no 'skin in the game', and they are not 'in it to win it'.<p>I didn't run into very many really and truly lazy people. Most people who didn't turn stuff in (that I talked to - please note the qualifier) simply didn't have priorities aligned with getting the degree with decent grades. Priorities in these cases might be ""getting drunk"", ""arguing with girlfriend"", ""got sick"", ""other class had test"".<p>My personal opinion is that Universities in the US are both training and education. We set our sights on education - we the academy - but our clients are often asking for training. I heard a slew of griping by the engineers (EE, ME) in a more theory-based linear algebra course. ""Give me numbers so I can stick them in my calculator and crunch them"" was the usual desire. When people's priorities are not aligned with learning what you are teaching, you get some poor behavior. My priority was ""take hard classes, learn what they teach, suck up the weaker grade"". So I sucked it up. I also have a bent for wanting to understand principles, which fits in well in academia.<p>I think the academy needs to contemplate the idea of ""white collar training"" and take that as potentially realistic option. Something like a three-year bachelor's degree. I am not sure. I think some CS students could use another year past the four just for code-mashing.<p>One college I heard about has two options for incoming students. Four year BSCS, or five year MSCS. The extra year adds theory.",1321407523

Starting a company is awkward, working in something without payment or having immediate profits is a waste of time or foolish. But that is changing with the crisis, everything goes now.<p>Getting people can be a bit difficult, most candidates I have interviewed had little experience (if at all), with free software technologies we use and demonstrated little will to learn (education tends to be centered on specific technologies), most don't work well unsupervised, thus our remote working experiment failed, they don't use modern development tools such as version control, bug tracking and project management software, etc. That is a generalization, of course there is brilliant people here too, but way more difficult to find, hopefully if a startup community concentrates in a place the skillful workforce will also concentrate there.<p>Government paperwork has always been abundant, complicated and time sink.<p>Taxes are not well leveled, either you are of low class (you have a small shop ""changarro/tiendita"") and pay a low tax, or you are middle class, a professional, you do consulting and give out receipts, your tax is relatively low and simple (you may require an accountant to make sure you don't fall into an obscure tax law and have problems), or finally you are the rich class, you are a corporation, you pay high federal taxes, state taxes, enterprise taxes (IETU), and retain value added tax (IVA, the equivalent of sale tax or VAT), only this bracket you will be able to give out invoices (invoices are centrally controlled by the government), which is a requirement when your clients are companies.<p>Most startups (incorporated) and companies will fall in the top bracket, even if you don't make millions, in other countries you are most likely to pay taxes based on your yearly income.<p>Financing is thought, the problem is government financing which is very prone to corruption, which means all those stimulus mostly go to friends, family and the corporate backers of those in the government (some politicians promise those stimulus to their backers beforehand in campaigns).<p>Finally, lets not get started with crime and violence, I live in a very peaceful part of the country but I have still received 2 or 3 calls arguing that they have a family member kidnapped, asking for money, a friend of mine even got a visit of an extortionist asking for ""piso"" money.<p>I can understand well why Julio is leaving, I was tempted too to apply to Startup Chile and start a new, but Mexico also has its key areas that are unexploited on technology and will be great business in the near future.",1321407294

It's easier to know why something succeed looking backwards.

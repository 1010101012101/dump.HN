You can take that ability you gained back to your home crag and demonstrate for yourself that it's real by polishing off projects that you'd been working on for years.  Then you can watch it fade away over the course of maybe half a year as you slip back into climbing with your old crowd.",1298586784

The glossy pictures give Grandma the impression that the UIs will merge and everything will be better <i>because of the new interface changes.</i><p>The substance behind this hype are the improvements toward ubiquitous computing.  No single improvement is revolutionary.  Auto Save and Versions means less worry about losing work.  Google Spreadsheets has these.  Resume is similar to Session Manager for Firefox.  It is useful for single computers now, but will be even more handy when we move around between computers and resume from anywhere.  AirDrop and even iPad File Sharing over WebDAV on Lion Server are efforts to integrate services like Dropbox into the core of the OS.<p>Management of these menial tasks and concerns fades to the background.  Google is artful in bringing such improvements to their web apps, and Apple is beautifully skilled at integrating new functionality and paradigms into their devices and OS platforms.<p>So we have saving, versioning (of sorts), resuming, and sharing.

We write software for a living ourselves, so producing an in-house bug tracker or CRM system or project dashboard takes a matter of hours, maybe a few days if we add more power to it later. It's only worth outsourcing the tools if the relatively small amount of time it saves us outweighs the many downsides: time lost to set up and maintain an external system, monthly cash cost to use it, having to fit our process around their tool instead of the other way around, interoperability issues if tools have related purposes but data is locked in, relying on external infrastructure for access, etc. etc.<p>That is only going to happen if the outsourced service offers a silky smooth set-up process, a tool that can be readily adjusted to our exact needs and still present a streamlined UI to match, immediate and convenient access to all the underlying data, and very low pricing, among other things. That's a pretty tall order, and frankly, none of the services we looked at seemed to be anywhere close.<p>We do use external software to run things like mail and web servers, but it's standard stuff running on our own boxes.<p>We are also looking at external services for tasks that are much more difficult/expensive to implement ourselves, such as payment processing and off-site back-up.<p>But for basic business admin, things like bug tracking, project planning, CRM and the like, we concluded that it wasn't even worth looking at the freebie software projects that do it. In the time it would take to properly evaluate a few of them and determine whether they could meet our needs, plus the time to customise them to do so, we could have just written exactly what we wanted from scratch.",1298586529

2260096,story,,,15,4,mixmax,"Ask HN: Funding for friends that are planning a manned space mission",,"Copenhagen suborbitals (www.copenhagensuborbitals.com)is a private, open source organisation whose mission is to launch human beings into space on privately built rockets and spacecrafts. The project is funded entirely by  donations and sponsors. The project is around two years old and things are progressing as planned. There have been numerous successful booster tests, and the first planned unmanned testflight is scheduled for this summer off the coast of Denmark. Last summer there was an unsuccsssful launchattempt where, believe it or not, the mission was jeopardized by a hairdryer that didn't work.<p>Amazingly they're doing this on a miniscule budget . As it is right now these guys are working fulltime and not getting a dime for their efforts. Their budget for the first half of 2011 is $51.000.<p>I've recently been involved in starting a support organisation for Copenhagen suborbitals, since their economy is extremely tight. The goal is to secure funding for their endeavour and help them with whatever they may need in the form of equipment, management, press, etc. A project as crazy and amazing as this deserves some support, both financially and otherwise. Since we started this support organisation we've gotten 257 members that each pay $20 a month. All of these members are Danish.<p>The question is: How do we raise more funding for these guys and their amazing project?<p>questions we're thinking about:<p>- Would other nationalities consider becoming a member of the support organisation and pay $20 a month? (In the unlikely event you really want to support this right now my e-mail is in my profile :-))<p>- Would it be possible for us to get one-time donations from individuals? Either high-worth people or just normal people that think this is cool.<p>- Should we try to run some kind of international campaign to get users? Since this  is all very low budget an international campaign will be a creditcard enabled website and posts on reddit and HN :-)<p>- Would there be a market for well-paid speaking arrangements where these guys come in and talk about how to build a spacerocket on a budget? (here's a talk one of the guys did on TEDx in Copenhagen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua9oGxNNGd0)<p>- Would a kickstarter project work?<p>- Any other ideas for how to raise money for this?<p>FAQ:<p><i>Launching a human being into space is difficult and expensive, can these guys really pull it off?</i> - I'm personally convinced that they will. They've built the worlds largest private submarine as a hobby project (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC3_Nautilus, http://www.uc3nautilus.dk/), have had several successful booster tests (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-RT8QfVYc4) and other tests (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_W_g878EdY) so it seems obvious that they know what they're doing.<p><i>How exactly will they do it?</i> - They're building a small rocket (64 cm. in diameter, 3.5 meter high, weight 300 kilos) that has a half sitting half standing space at the top for the astronaut. The top of the rocket will have a plexiglass dome so the astronaut has an excellent view. The rocket will propel the astronaut past the barrier to space (100 km) and then parachutes will bring the astronaut safely back to earth.<p><i>Isn't this dangerous</i> - Yes.<p><i>Where will the money from the support organization go?</i> - All money raised is transferred to Copenhagen suborbitals, except for small amounts used for webhosting, etc. Noone in the support organization is paid.",1298586273

When cold calling around a 5% success rate is quite good, so if you called 100 agencies and got 5 meetings you'd be going well.<p>Also how big were the agencies you were targeting? And were they the ""digital"" agency or the ""above the line"" agency? You'll have more luck with agencies that already do trade promotions through SMS, Web and other ""tech"" solutions.<p>So maybe ""ad agency"" is the wrong word - you want marketing agencies and probably more specifically the ones calling themselves ""digital marketing"".<p>(warning: I'm from Australia, terminology may be different ... )<p>For example: a few years ago I got on the phone to sell some SMS services. I wanted to sell to real estate agencies, so I started calling them and asking to speak to the person in charge of marketing. I called around 20 RE agencies and got one actually talking for long enough that they said ""We use WORLD FAMOUS AD AGENCY for all our SMS and MMS"". So then I called WORLD FAMOUSE AD AGENCY (which is a global marketing/ad agency with both above and below the line services) and spoke to them, and they were <i>sort of</i> interested, like didn't blow me off immediately but as you said, kind of ""run around"", but one thing is they weren't interested in SMS, they were interested in MMS.<p>I called my SMS provider and asked if they could do MMS, they said no, but I should call LARGE SMS PROVIDER IN AUSTRALIA. So I called them and asked about MMS for WORLD FAMOUS AD AGENCY, but LARGE SMS PROVIDER actually gave me the full story: that WORLD FAMOUS AD AGENCY uses UNHEARD OF DIGITAL MARKETING AGENCY who use TINY TECHNICAL GATEWAY PROVIDER who use LARGE SMS PROVIDER. This was just an off-hand comment, so I called UNHEARD OF MARKETING AGENCY and pitched MMS to them at a price point I thought would be undercutting the competition.<p>I got a meeting with them, but they realised that I wasn't doing the MMS - I was using the same guys that the guys they use now were currently using - basically because I wasn't presenting technology I had created but technology they had already seen. We had a good laugh about it and I got some web/hosting work out of them.<p>Now I didn't end up selling them the MMS, or SMS but this was the level of marketing agency that would talk to a small, independent operator, and also that really explored every new available technology such as Bluetooth, SMS, MMS, Web, trade promotions etc. rather than huge ad agencies that are directly talking to the big brands. They generally hold a relationship with the big ad agency, then the big ad agency has the relationship with the brand.<p>Short story: just start smaller down the food chain. You'll find that big agencies are rarely doing all the work themselves - at some point it's always just a lonely dweeb sitting at home coding in his underpants.",1298585319

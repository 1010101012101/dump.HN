An example: some people look for misspelled items being auctioned (an auction where the item being auctioned is not spelled right, attracts a lot fewer bidders), buy them low, and sell them high at another auction. Looks like a truly classic arb! Of course, there's still the risk that the item one has just bought will attract no bidders...<p>In exchange-traded financial instruments, arbitrage is now incredibly more difficult than what it was 100 years ago. Computers and communications killed most of the arbs. But it's still possible to find arbs in structured products :-)<p>And, although sports betting sites are shady, I would bet there are quasi-arbitrage opportunities to be found in online sports-bettings these days...",1263096007

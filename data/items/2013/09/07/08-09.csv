And Nginx just working with 4 instances and serving just as much, with a reduced average latency of page load, justified the move.<p>And I sort of felt sad doing this.

6344433,comment,6340636,6340919,2,0,cpncrunch,,,"Not sure why cheery was downvoted - it was a legitimate question. Seems like he/she&#x27;s been hellbanned for no apparent reason.<p>Anyway, to answer your question I haven&#x27;t invented anything particularly groundbreaking, just still I need to do my job. Things like 3d collision detection, line-of-sight detection, etc.<p>As a more concrete example, in the days before broadband I had a problem with transmitting the positions of multiple players in a multi-user game environment. Say you have hundreds of users on dial-up, some with 10ms ping time and others with 100ms. The 10ms users will be able to transmit their position 100 times a second, but the 100ms users can only transmit 10 times a second (assuming they wait for a reply). It doesn&#x27;t make sense to transmit 100 movement updates to the slow clients, as you&#x27;ll just overload their connection with unnecessary data. So what is the best solution? The algorithm I came up with is this:<p>- server maintains &quot;last position&quot; coords plus timestamp for each client\n- whenever server receives a position update from a client x, it sends the positions of any clients who have sent updates since client x last sent an update<p>Not groundbreaking, but it took quite a lot of thought to come up with it. The beauty is that it only transmits the data that is needed - the fast clients get fast updates (but without sending any duplicated data), and the slow clients get slow updates. It&#x27;s simple, elegant and efficient, which is the best type of algorithm.<p>PS, I don&#x27;t work in the games industry or with 3d graphics - all that stuff was really just my hobby. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve had to come up with some algorithms for the stuff that pays the rent (which is also pretty interesting), although I can&#x27;t think of any off the top of my head. I did come up with a sound compression algorithm using FFTs, but abandoned it for an off-the-shelf one that worked much better. For the most part it is better to use algorithms that someone else has already figured out and turned into code rather than reinventing the wheel.",1378543551

So far they&#x27;re only talking about encrypting data between servers and they&#x27;ve also recently talked about encrypting Drive storage data (why wasn&#x27;t it encrypted in the first place?!)<p>They need to implement OTR or some form of end to end encryption with PFS for Hangouts, and it would be nice if they at least gave the <i>option</i> to have encrypted calls and voice calls with ZRTP in Hangouts.

But I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s optional only because I&#x27;m not sure how it could impact what they&#x27;re trying to do with Hangouts, and if ZRTP works with multiple people at once.

There are 10 bazillion different OSS projects, and there is almost no way on heaven or earth for somebody who doesn&#x27;t know you, to tell you which one(s) to start with.  It depends on what you&#x27;re interested in, what your skills are, how motivated you are, how much of a self-starter you are, etc.<p>And, truth be told, it&#x27;s a darkside of the OSS community that we aren&#x27;t very good at &quot;hand holding&quot; beginners - much to the detriment of everybody involved, IMO.  The reasons for that are legion, but for whatever reason, a lot of projects aren&#x27;t all that interested in helping a newbie move up the learning curve.<p>Anyway, for somebody from HN to help you very much, it would almost take somebody who runs a project to step in and make a specific offer to work with you.  Otherwise, all somebody can really do is offer platitudes like &quot;look for a project that really interests you&quot; and &quot;look for projects that publish a list of &#x27;low hanging fruit&#x27; bugs for beginners&quot; (there <i>are</i> projects that do that, and that is good advice, BTW).

Hell, just going in and removing commented out &quot;dead code&quot; could be useful to some projects.<p>One angle you could look into is pick a project, download it, and run a code analysis tool against it (if you were a Java guy, I&#x27;d say PMD or FindBugs, but you&#x27;ll have to find the equivalent for your chosen platform) and then examine some of the supposed &quot;bugs&quot; it find (quoted because a lot of the &quot;bugs&quot; they find are false positives or subjective issues of style), decide if it really matters or not, and possibly submit a patch.<p>Anyway... wish I could help more, but that&#x27;s about everything that jumps to mind at the moment.

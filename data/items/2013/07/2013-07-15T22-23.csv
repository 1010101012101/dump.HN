When you take a sick day, your work is sitting there when you get back. It hasn&#x27;t moved.<p>Students don&#x27;t have that luxury. The material keeps marching on without them. So not only are they having to learn material they aren&#x27;t properly prepared for, they also have to go back and relearn what they missed.<p>Providing slides online in the 21st century is literally one of the most basic things a professor can do. Literally. Install dropbox, put the slides in the dropbox folder. Make the folder public. Done. This requires zero technical know-how, and maybe 2 minutes of signup?<p>The unwillingness to do that is indicative of a bad professor. Barring unreasonable requests, a professor should try to enable students to do well.<p>As far as saying, &quot;just get them from a friend.&quot; This presents a few problems. 
1. You need to have a friend in the class. Not always the case. 
2. That friend needs to be there. Sickness travels through social groups very effectively. My friend is more likely to be sick than I am.
3. That friend needs to be at least on my level of competency for the notes to be meaningful. Not everyone&#x27;s friends are as smart as they are.

In fact, the Harry Potter books were quite brilliant in the way they threaded clues throughout the story - all of which unravelled so cleverly at the end of the final novel.<p>In fact, this skill for storytelling or narrative is something shared by many &quot;children&#x27;s authors&quot;. Plot sometimes seems to be a dirty word in adult fction, especially literary fiction. You can have a good plot and good characterisation - they are not mutually exclusive. Another British writer, Philip Pullman, has also acknowledged the importance of story. I like this extract from Guardian article in 2000 on Philip Pullman [1]<p><i>he...is not afraid to acknowledge the importance of plot in his work. &#x27;When you are writing for children,&#x27; he told the Bookseller in 1996, &#x27;the story is more important than you are. You can&#x27;t be self-conscious, you just have to get out of the way.&#x27; Because it is easier to write description and dialogue than tell a good story, very many contemporary novelists write bad plots...Pullman seems to know this...<p>It&#x27;s in the importance he attaches to narrative that sets Pullman apart from all those highly-praised contemporary writers who cannot plot for toffee.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2000/oct/22/whitbreadprize2001.costabookaward"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2000/oct/22/whitbreadprize20...</a>",1373927322

If we implement replace-by-fee nodes will always forward the transaction with the highest overall fee (including parents) even if it would double-spend a previous transaction. At first glance this appears to make double-spending trivial and zero-confirmation transactions useless, but in fact it enables a powerful counter-measure to an attempted double-spend: the merchant who was ripped off creates a subsequent transaction sending 100% of the funds to mining fees. All replace-by-fee miners will mine that transaction, rather than the one sending the funds back to the fraudster, and there is nothing the fraudster can do about it other than hope they get lucky and some one mines their double-spend before they hear about the counter spend. The transaction can also be constructed such that the payee pays slightly more in advance, with the merchant refunding the extra amount once the transaction confirms, to ensure that a double-spend will result in a net loss for the fraudster.&quot; - <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=251233.msg2669189#msg2669189"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=251233.msg2669189#ms...</a><p>In English, if you want to reverse a transaction, IE cancel a payment, the most you can steal from the person you paid is the value of the transaction itself. But if we implement a system where you can change a transaction after the fact, sending more of the fees to miners, the merchant can always outbid you, so it&#x27;s almost impossible to actually get away with the theft and gain anything. You&#x27;ll still pay for whatever you stole, thus turning what was a profitable attack, into a unprofitable attack that at best is simple vandalism.

Meaning, people who would normally buy a cd/track, and who do not since they listen to it on spotify.  I think people can agree this cost is not zero - some sales definitely <i>are</i> lost - but they&#x27;ll argue the magnitude of the cost.<p>There is also a benefit in terms of discovery.  This is the streaming revenue, plus the sales that come from discovery.  I think people can agree the benefit is above zero - discovery <i>does</i> happen - but they&#x27;ll again argue magnitude.<p>The question is whether the discovery benefit outweighs the cost.  There are widely varying opinions on this, and it can really only be answered with data rather than by someone&#x27;s strong opinion.<p>It&#x27;s also tricky question to test because I think the counterfactuals may be impossible.

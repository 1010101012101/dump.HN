He sees both pain and low mood as warning mechanisms and thinks that, just as understanding chronic pain means first understanding normal pain, so understanding clinical depression means understanding mild depression.</i><p>In other words, yes, people with clinical depression find that it gets in the way of their daily life.  His hypothesis is about why normal, healthy people suffer from low mood / mild depression from time-to-time, and what evolutionary advantage that might give us.",1246157710

677454,comment,677291,677291,0,0,a-priori,,,"If this pans out, it could be revolutionary. They mention facial reconstruction in passing. I once knew a woman who was in a car crash and had to have one side of her face reconstructed a few years earlier. The surgeon did a wonderful job, but it was still a long and painful process for her.<p>Another use I can think of is for after heart bypass surgery, or other surgery where they have to crack the sternum. This putty could be used to fuse the sternum back together, which would probably speed healing.",1246156315

677451,comment,675006,676789,0,0,nomoresecrets,,,"The very image and text used in the article implies that the original poster is correct.<p>Look at the example for 32 - it is given as 8 + 2x12. The hand on the right has two fingers extended.  Clearly all fingers can be extended in this image, and then the number would be 8 + 5x12 = 68.  If the left hand is used to count to 12, the number is 12 + 5x12, or 12+60=72.<p>Either the limit is 60, or the images/text in the article are wrong.",1246156062

677448,comment,677381,677381,0,0,pwncat,,,"I disagree with this argument. I think another one's more salient. For a pack animal such as primal humans probably were, a certain type of moderate depression is a survival mechanism for dealing with low social status. Your appetite and libido decrease, you become inassertive, you accept mistreatment from others. Subjectively, this process and experience sucks, but lacking desire to mate with the alpha female keeps the omega male alive. Much more importantly (since nature doesn't care much about unsuccessful individuals) it's a survival mechanism for the <i>pack</i>; the depressive response ensures that, in extreme scarcity, the less successful individuals slink away and accept starvation, rather than challenging and potentially causing harm to the more important ones.<p>In modern society, this reaction is completely useless and utterly maladaptive. It also has a tendency to fire in people at all levels of social status, because modern society (with its dynamic, subtle, and multileveled play of social status) is confusing to the primal mind. So a depressive response can be rightly considered an illness.<p>Civilization expects everyone to assume the role most closely analogous to high beta/low alpha. People who have omega traits tend to be depressives; people who have too many alpha traits are sociopaths.",1246155807

677444,comment,677381,677427,0,0,pie,,,"Perhaps the hypothesis would apply more to the approach/situation rather than the goal.<p>If depressed people despair that they cannot find new friends or lose some weight, maybe the depression might direct them to try something new.

Some of those young people will become excited about biology, and some will not, but all of them will make their best and most creative contributions if they enjoy the freedom to pursue their interests.<p>Somewhat related to this topic, if a young person is very interested in mathematics and computer programming at age sixteen, the summer before he applies to college (I know a few cases like this), what advice would you have for that young person about how to prepare well to make a positive difference with that interest in math and computer science?",1246155150
677437,comment,677409,677409,0,0,psyklic,,,"Unless medical research is someone's passion, the creativity and intuition needed to break through to new cures likely will not be present. This proposed system will introduce many new worker drones to the field, but likely few additions who actually love the subject.<p>So if funding stays the same, I bet a lot of the people with actual passion for the subject will be pushed out in favor of people with perfect resumes but little passion. Hence, perhaps cures will come around even more slowly.",1246155008

The linked transcript seems to be the real deal, the raw transcript of (a part of) the interview that was later translated for the magazine.<p>The transcript sounds pretty natural (then again, I’m not a native English speaker) even if it might not fit the usual style of Gates. The German interview sounds a little strange (you immediately notice that it was translated). I don’t think it was translated by a very skilled translator.

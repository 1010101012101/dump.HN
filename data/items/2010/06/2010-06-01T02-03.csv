And they are capacitive; you don't press the key all the way down to type the key.)  They are like Cherry browns done right, tactile, quiet, and no requirement to ""bottom out"".  Topre really goes over the top with the part of the key that presses the dome; hard ABS plastic, with anti-rotation tabs, and a shape that makes even off-center hits go straight down.  (You can push the key from the side, instead of from above, and the key doesn't jam; it just slides down normally.  It's really brilliant.)<p>Oh, and this is true of both the Realforce and the HHKB Professional; same switches, different layout.",1275361119

1394179,story,,,2,2,smachimo,"Ask HN: Fishy Travel Post-Booking Request",,"This is my first post on here, but I thought it might be interesting. Here's the skinny:<p>Two flights were booked with an online service, let's call it ""Woohoo"". The name on the credit card used in the transaction was the same as the name on one of the tickets. This person also purchased a ticket for a second person.<p>From my experience using any service to book flights online, they simply send a confirmation email and ticket combo.<p>So here is where things went fishy. They sent an email with a subject saying ""3rd PARTY <i></i><i>URGENT - CREDIT CARD AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED FOR BOOKING</i><i></i>"". The entire structure of the email is very poor and unprofessional (only writing, no logos, varying size of font, 3+ font colors, CAPS, <i></i>*, etc). Now the smelliest bit of info in this email is as follows:<p>__________<p>By accepting the terms and conditions during the reservation process, you have agreed to submitting the following required information.<p>In order to release the tickets we require all of the following information faxed or scanned and emailed:<p>From the credit card holder:
1) A legible copy of a photo identification.  We will only accept the following: Valid Passport or Valid Drivers license
2) A letter stating that the cardholder (by name) is authorizing WOOHOO to charge the credit card on behalf of the passenger travelling (by name).  The booking number and the amount to be charged must also be in the letter.
3) A legible signature from the cardholder must also be present on the letter.
4) A legible copy of credit card used front and back<p>From the passenger:
1) A legible copy of a photo identification.  We will accept the following: Valid Passport, Valid Drivers license or Valid birth certificate.<p>This information must all be faxed to XXX-XXX-XXXX attn: Web Department 
You can also scan and email the information to WOOHOO@woohoo.com
__________<p>What's your thoughts? I can vaguely imagine the need for such a confirmation, but it looks shady! Imagine a page including a valid identification of you, the front and back copy of your credit card, and your signature getting into the wrong hands. And also, the thought of faxing a page like this is troubling. I'm under an assumption that ""reputable"" online companies will protect customer credit card numbers in a fairly thorough manner, but it's acceptable to fax this info along with other valuable info...? I wonder what their security is like around a fax machine.<p>Let me know if I am out to lunch on this, otherwise, how would you handle this? Hope this was interesting and sorry for the novel :)",1275361068

In the real world, we have Notaries. In the online world, we often try and use some other trusted third party as a proxy for a notary.<p>That's what the credit card schemes are. You're trusting that the credit card company has done their homework and verified the identity of the person they're issuing a card to. Sadly, this isn't the case; I know someone who once ordered a credit card for their dog.<p>As with any authentication system, the first question you have to ask yourself is how important is the system you're guarding? What is the aim of the authentication?<p>The lower the value of the system, the less you can put into it. To sign up for an email list, you can probably just ask for an email address and send a verification link. To handle a large financial transaction with an untrusted third party, you're going to want a whole lot stronger verification.<p>So it really comes down to whether your interest here is for a practical application, or if it's purely academic and you're just wanting to compile a list.",1275360635

I was quite surprised to see only the the odd iPhone here and there.  The iPhone had already been out for a long time, with great success most everywhere else, so I thought maybe there was something unique about the way they use their phones (the Japanese are constantly reading or typing on their phones) such that the iPhone was inferior (I still don't know the answer to this).<p>Spring 2010...iPhones everywhere.  On any given train, of the people visibly using a cell phone, 20% to 40% of them had an iPhone.  It was a pretty impressive conversion in the span of one year.<p>I did see the new Sony XPeria in the stores over there, it did look like a fairly nice device.  But the advantage the iPhone will always have is the app store, there are some really cool Japan only apps that (for now) you can only get on the iPhone.<p>Maybe Japanese cell phone companies should just standardize on Android and try to come out with the slickest Japanese implementation first, then try to re-tackle the international market if they can pull that off.",1275360633

The only solution is to not use service providers and to distribute your own data (as you have described).  When you distribute your own data, you can have nightly encryption key updates sent to all of the friends you trust.  If you remove a friend from your list, they do not get the nightly key update and no longer have access to your information.

is not obvious to me, and the tutorial doesn't explain what each piece of the new syntax means, and quickly moves on to something new in step 8.<p>Only through experimentation, I find:<p><pre><code>  fst (28,""chirs"")
  => 28
  snd (28,""chirs"")
  => ""chirs""
</code></pre>
So I gather the let is equivalent to:<p><pre><code>  (let ((villain '(28 ""chirs"")))
    (first villain))
</code></pre>
But without parens, line breaks or semicolons I have difficulty determining where one expression ends and another begins.<p>Plus, the arbitrary shortening of ""first"" to ""fst"" doesn't help, and should probably be clarified.<p>You seem to only check the return value to determine when to skip to the next step in the tutorial, since in step10, you want me to type:<p><pre><code>  ['a','b','c'] == ""abc""
</code></pre>
But it skips ahead when I play around and return True from a different expression:<p><pre><code>  'a' : 'b' : [] == ""ab""

Not with the attitude of promoting my product, but of promoting the field (I happen to really enjoy teaching and explaining, so this was a happy coincidence).

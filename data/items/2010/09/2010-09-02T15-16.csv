Add to this the fact that the entirety of Sweden itself is maintained to a higher standard; consistently pure/clean water, well-maintained roads, clean parks, well-maintained public services, etc.  I wonder how well the textbook definition of ""standard of living"" corresponds with real life.

It's by a German game company (they have 180 employees and pump out a lot of games) so they're not quite ""indie""; but the game's sole review is from me (I reviewed both the lite and pay versions), and no one has rated it. It's a well done puzzle game with a really nice interface. It's my current favorite iPad game.<p>Just Deliver It (iPad) is a really polished game from a Japanese developer. Great music, graphics and interface. IMO the game itself is not so great, but it may be other people's cup of tea. It's also a puzzle game. It has 13 ratings and no reviews, so I'm sure the developer is not seeing a return on investment.<p>Brainstory (iPhone) is surprisingly polished for such an obscure little entry tucked away in the app store. It's got great graphics. But the whole thing is just really weird, and I think that turns people off. It's a pretty standard puzzle game ala columns or dr. mario.<p>Ninja Block (iPhone) is a strange beast. Also from a small Japanese team. It has beautiful graphics (their artist is awesome), strange canned music, engrish galore :), and the game itself is mindlessly stupid. You have to stack blocks on top of each other as high as you can. The engrish, bad music and slightly raw feel the game has is a turn off. Some things just aren't very polished, it could have used another week of dev time. But I actually think if they could have polished it up just a tad more (and hired someone who speaks english well), they would have had a good entry in the very popular ""super simple games that only shoot for a high score"" that totally dominate iOS.<p>ESP Galuda II (iPhone) is from Cave, a very successful long time player in the shmup genre (huge in Japan). ESP Galuda II is by no means ignored (63 ratings and 27 reviews), but since it's from Cave (they are just a fantastic company), it's disappointing. iOS users, you were given caviar and you ignore it! :)",1283442074

He calls Google's policy of letting people use paid apps for as long as 24 hours and return them for a full refund ""senseless and lazy.""<p>I think this is interesting. There is a definite divide between game programmers and ""utility"" programmers on this issue.<p>As a developer of a utility app, I am in favor of the 24 hour policy. It means people will try my app, see that it does what they need and decide to keep it. Of course this only works because it offers ongoing utility. (Shameless plug: <a href=""http://www.appidio.com/apps/gas-oil-mix/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appidio.com/apps/gas-oil-mix/</a>)<p>Given the typical quality of mobile apps in general, I know I would personally be much less inclined to buy one without the possibility of a refund. Nobody likes being ripped off.<p>However, games are typically a fleeting distraction. You download a game, play it for a half hour and may very well never use it again. I'm quite sure the 24 hour refund policy hurts game sales.<p>Perhaps what Google needs to do is allow developers to choose whether or not they allow refunds. I do not mind at all if someone returns my app. It obviously wasn't worth their $0.99 - that's my fault. But there are plenty of apps that have a very short anticipated lifespan or single plausible use event. Making them subject to the 24 hour return policy really hurts those product categories.",1283441833

Its part of the benefits package.  You will still typically pay $100-400 a month out of pocket depending on if you have family and kids.  That also may include dental and vision.  Dental is common, vision is not.<p>If you are self employed or work at a small company, then insurance is a big deal. I'm going to pay $6K a year for crappy insurance and I'm still going to pay $7k out of pocket expensive this year because my son had to have surgery and our deductible is 7500.  So I think the insurance situation sucks.  And I got a notice yesterday that they are raising my rates again.  For small business that want to cover the health insurance for their employees it is also a big expense and one that keeps rising.  It amazes me that insurance companies can raise rates 15-40% a year and get away with it.<p>As far as saving up for college education, that is not as difficult because it is a matter of living within your means.  Make it a priority and save.  That said I have different views on fully paying for 4 years of college vs. having my kids pay part of their way.

10244,comment,10034,10234,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Visual Confusion<p>The main flaw I see, using clarity of communication as a standard, is the lack of right justification.  This is compounded with the quoted material that is also not right justified.  It looks confusing.  <p>Hierarchical Differentiation<p>Also, the quoted material is <i>slightly</i> smaller than the main text.  The text size difference should vary in a greater degree if the idea is to have the text size differentiate between the kind of message being expressed. (In this case differentiating the source of the message.)<p>Lack of Consistency<p>The article uses a blank line as a way to differentiate paragraphs.  This rule is broken in the fourth paragraph.<p>",1175992103
10243,comment,10001,10041,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Facebook's 'young' and 'technical' performance requirements must be off the wall ;) <p>For the vast majority of apps, the latency will not be an issue. Especially since S3DFS has caching built in. <p>A good example is SmugMug who switches over to use S3 to serve out images when they are working on their own datacenter. Don McCaskill (their CEO and head programmer) says that switching back and forth was completely transparent to their users with no human-discernible latency.

Do you mean vis-a-vis the competition?\nFor example, with juwo, you can see the table of contents of the audio/video clip. This functionality is also available in some of the flash players. Do you remove the overlapped feature? ",1175991446
10239,comment,10191,10191,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Great article on EC2! The author misnamed the article though since it hardly mentions anything at all about Rails specifically. Regardless, definitely a good read and introduction to the pros/cons of EC2 for beginners.",1175991162
10238,comment,10238,9936,0,0,iamwil,,,"Huh.  I just read about this, after following the track about ""Magic Ink"" to look for where the idea of GUIs came from.  A lot of what's in Engelbart's demo looks surprisingly modern.  Considering that it's been about 40-50 years, that's pretty amazing.",1175991129

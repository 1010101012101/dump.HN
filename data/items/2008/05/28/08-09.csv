201900,comment,201373,201578,0,0,wheels,,,"It's a mix here.  There's definitely a bohemian atmosphere (in many, not all parts of the city), but reducing that to sex and drugs isn't really fair.  It extends to arts, street culture, work environments, etc.  I think I see what you're getting at though, so I'll give a few specific examples of rules that are broken here:<p>- ""Living in a big cultural center is expensive.""  It's cheap here.  I don't know of any other western cultural center where that's true.  3.5 million people and there's a housing surplus.  This has a huge effect on the city.<p>- ""You need a lot of money.""  A side-effect of the above, there's a real de-emphasis on having cash here.<p>- ""You should have a normal job.""  For good and bad, there's not much big industry in Berlin.  Most of my friends either work independently or in relatively small companies.  Most of those companies aren't startups in the sense that we use the word here, but small businesses that do well enough.<p>- ""You need to grow up.""  You can still go out here when you're 30.  Or 40.  And it's not weird.  And it doesn't mean you're not professional.  Similarly, there doesn't seem to be the taboo against founding a startup over 30 (I'm 27 and one of the younger guys at the meetups I've been going to.).",1211964213
201899,comment,201151,201151,0,0,Tichy,,,"It sounded good at first, but ""Environmentalism as a Religion""?? Personally, I care about the environment because I LIKE nature, not because I feel it is some god-given mission to be steward of the earth.<p>Also, nature is a common good, so if I care about someone else destroying it, it might be less about wanting to spoil his fun, and more about me not wanting him to effectively steal something from me.",1211964119
201898,comment,201373,201482,0,0,hv23,,,"The problem is that Columbia is situated so far away from the other two, and from the ""heart"" of the city, that the university simply cannot have the same overarching influence on society that other schools that are better integrated with their surroundings do (like Harvard and MIT with Cambridge). \nIn addition, it's a matter of pure density- Cambridge and Boston, to a lesser extent, is seen as a college town because of the density of college students living in that area. In New York, college students compose such a tiny percentage of the overall population, and exert such a small influence on everyone else, that they are hardly given a second thought when determining the dominant themes in a city's ideology.",1211964000
201897,comment,201819,201871,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"You're partially right. I'm a Windows programmer, and that's probably why I switched to Linux with the Vista release. I still program for Windows, but from the safety and comfort of a virtual machine. What you say about spyware and trojans and viruses simply isn't true - it's really easy to keep a Windows machine clean: NOD32 + Windows Defender is more than enough. However, the reason for ""which hasn't been an enjoyable experience"" can be found in the lack of stability and performance that we're seeing on the Windows platform. A decade's worth of Win32 gunk has caught up with Vista, and it's made coding Windows applications a serious PITA. It seems that somewhere between Windows XP and Windows Vista the proverbial ""last straw"" was added, and it's made coding for Windows Vista such a dreadful nightmare. It's not fun; & more to the point, it's exasperating.<p>Using a framework like .NET helps like crazy (.NET:Beautiful::Win32:Ugly) but the performance and reliability issues still persist no matter what you build your applications on.<p>Take for instance my current Vista install. Out of the blue it won't resolve DNS addresses - for no reason. Basically, the mess of code that is the TCP/IP stack - just like the other stacks in need of a from-scratch implementation on Windows - has gotten corrupted somewhere along the way to the point that reinstalling networking drivers, clearing ARP routes, etc. just won't fix.<p>Too much gunk === impossibly difficult to keep stable/reliable for any period of time.",1211963994

I grew up in Columbus, and while it was a nice place to be a kid, I could never live there today.  Too sheltered.<p>And trust me...the valley isn't scary.  It's nothing but a gigantic suburb, punctuated with office parks.  Sure, the housing is hideously expensive, and there are freakishly rich people everywhere, but otherwise, the place won't present a challenge to you.  San Francisco, on the other hand, is a different world....",1211963328

You can get started pretty much for free, and if things take off, worry about moving it someplace better.<p>OTOH, I've pretty much gone with Ruby at this point, and since that's not an option, I'll just keep my own server.  I do like the control I have, even if it's expensive.",1211962084
201885,comment,201819,201819,0,0,bouncingsoul,,,"You've conflated two separate issues (Vista the OS and Vista's launch) so it's hard to argue accurately about this. I think you're using a too-broad definition of <i>launch</i> if you can offer <i>improved search</i> as evidence of a successful one.<p>I would agree that Vista is an upgrade in the same way XP was: moderate improvements with new UI things to learn. And I think you're very right to refer back to XP's launch and how the same complaining was made then.<p>But I don't see who you can call Vista's launch a success. This would probably be better debated with empirical data about sales and time on the market and stuff, but just the general vibe about Vista is so horribly negative in ways I don't remember XP's ever being.<p>You say this is because more people are making their negative reactions known this time around, and we should ignore them because people like to bitch. But I don't think it's a forgone conclusion that their reactions would be negative -- they could've reacted positively.<p>I doubt Microsoft is proud of Vista's launch.",1211962026
201884,comment,201373,201766,0,0,davidw,,,"As another anecdote, here in Austria, which for many things has similar laws to Germany, you can't have dual citizenship, and being born here doesn't confer citizenship on you, as it does in places like the US, or Italy.  So our daughter will be Italian and American, despite being born in Austria (not that we would have wanted it otherwise, but still...).<p>I met a German guy in the states, who was born and raised there, considered himself German, but didn't get citizenship until 18 or 19 because his parents were from Turkey.",1211961856

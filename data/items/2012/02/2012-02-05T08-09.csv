For me, the enjoyment was gone, and only the habit remained, along with a pile of worries about if/when my health would fail. After a rough few days, I've not looked back, and have no plans to drink again (I could never moderate). I too have lost weight, feel great, and still enjoy parties. My wife is somewhat dismayed that the stupid behaviour she put down to the drink is actually the real me and my warped mind! If you like drinking and can drink in moderation, then keep going, but if you need to stop, then go for it. Just stop fully, and stay stopped.

You as an individual have the freedom to choose not to read what they publish. You don't have the freedom to restrict what or how they publish, that is their choice.<p>With software licenses the copyright holder has the freedom to pick a license and publish their work how they choose. With BSD-like licenses the receiver of the software also has the freedom to pick a license and re-publish the work as they choose.

Once you've learned most of what there's to learn about CRUD implementation and gluing them together, you need to get out as soon as possible or a couple of years down the line you'll simply not be qualified enough for any other position in CS.<p>That or you can write code in whatever spare time you might have from your 8-10 hours a day job. Based on what's said around HN, people putting in 14 hours a day coding are not that uncommon these days, so perhaps it's something programmers are better get used to. Remember to blog, have a rich github portfolio, contribute to OSS and run your own consulting consulting company in the spare time from your full-time job.",1328430025

The fines, if any, won't come from their pockets; they will (indirectly) come from ours. Jail time is deserved, and it is sad to see that even 3 years later, none of these scumbags has seen the inside of a prison cell yet.<p>We can jail a man for 14 years for contempt of court [1], but why isn't filing false declarations in court prosecuted similarly?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Beatty_Chadwick"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Beatty_Chadwick</a>",1328429550

Maybe something multiplayer using real terrain, like a scavenger hunt--you could mark objects and leave clues with this sort of tool. In fact, any sort of game that involves actually moving around could benefit from this, and I think games like that could be very interesting.<p>Another thought is board/card games (like Magic: The Gathering) could benefit from this. You could get nice little animation when you play your cards--not terribly useful, but could be very amusing. You could also have wizard chess like Harry Potter (sort of).<p>Really, the big trick is being able to integrate with the outside world.

I'm from Brazil myself, and it's worrying to see that, together with the latest economic changes (higher income), parenting is getting more distant to what she describes to happen in France, and is starting to shaping up the same problems seen in USA. I from a 80's generation and had an education close to what she describes, but nowadays parents work overhours to try to afford an expensive lifestyle, kids are raised by nannies and they basically play videogame the whole day. I'm sure this lifestyle doesn't allow kids to educate themselves with so many distractions and instant gratification around, and in an atmosphere that demands so much from parents (working overhours instead of enjoying the family, having time free for friends, dinners, etc.).",1328429083

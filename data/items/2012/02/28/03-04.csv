3641823,comment,3641370,3641630,2,0,cwilson,,,"I came here to say a version of this, so I'll just comment/expand on your post.<p>First, like you, I don't think business cards are the solution. Not only are they insanely wasteful, but the only way to ""stand out"" of the pile of business cards someone inevitably has at the end of an event, is by having the best or most clever design, which is of course all subjective anyway.<p>I too have started handing my phone over to people I meet who I actually want to engage with later, and usually this involves trading phones, so I can give them my information as well (it's more likely one of the two of us will actually follow up).<p>That said, it's almost always a different medium where we exchange information. It might be sending a text, adding to contacts, friending on Facebook (if we're really hitting it off), following on Twitter, or simply sending an email. By the end of the night I've initiated conversations in multiple places, and it becomes harder to follow up and remember who is who.<p>This is why I DO think the design of this application is actually pretty great. The idea of it all being centrally located, based on time/encounters, as well as showing faces, does make sense. The execution, and real-world use however, is where it falls short.<p>Like others in this thread, I also agree that having someone take a picture of themselves is potentially awkward (I'm sure some people would be perfectly happy to do this, but I'd personally feel odd about it).<p>The last problem is what kills Bump for me, and that's that it's rare that others have Bump as well. We both have to have the application for it to work, and because of that... I've deleted Bump (as have others). I suppose Evernote has half solved this here, but the trading part of the demo does face this problem.<p>What makes more sense to me is working with a service like Rapportive, and based on one piece of data, instantly pulling in everything I need to know about this person for future reference, as well as all of their networks.",1330401458
3641822,comment,3641184,3641576,1,0,JohnsonB,,,"This article: <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/09/smallbusiness/kiva_robots/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/09/smallbusiness/kiva_robots/in...</a> says that 1000 robots costs $15-20 million, not the $500 million that 500k a piece would run. Also what is there to indicate such a hefty need for engineering oversight? 20 engineers constantly overseeing the machines sounds like they are either constantly breaking down, or need a significant amount of custom programming per unit as upkeep, both of which just sounds like a quality control issue on Kiva's side. It makes sense that there's a lot of <i>initial</i> planning/programming for each installation, but I'd expect it to be mostly self-running after that. I would be curious about the energy needs per unit, though. They seem to be carrying around more weight per package shipped than with a  human picker carrying just what goes in one package, but then again their use of energy might be more efficient than humans.",1330401380

The US has had its hands on oil and other resources the world over, ensuring favorable prices, preferential treatment and US petrol companies' control over oil springs.

Here's a small example:<p>Iraq's massive oil reserves, the third-largest in the world, are about to be thrown open for large-scale exploitation by Western oil companies under a controversial law which is expected to come before the Iraqi parliament within days.\nThe US government has been involved in drawing up the law, a draft of which has been seen by The Independent on Sunday. It would give big oil companies such as BP, Shell and Exxon 30-year contracts to extract Iraqi crude and allow the first large-scale operation of foreign oil interests in the country since the industry was nationalised in 1972.<p><a href=""http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article2132569.ece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article21325...</a><p>or:<p>The Carter administration  the most idealist of the post-World War II presidencies in terms of its rhetoric  openly acknowledged in National Security Directive (NSD) 63 (and after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan) the need to ensure the availability of oil [from the Middle East] at reasonable prices.  Carters administration announced that any attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States.  It will be repelled by the use of any means necessary, including military force.  This policy of targeting unfriendly governments that reside in regions tangential to the Middle East was further reinforced in other official policy documents.  In discussing U.S. policy, the Reagan administration explained in NSD 27 the need to ensure the U.S. access to foreign energy and mineral forces as a key aspect of national security priorities. Carter established a similar concern in NSD 63, discussing U.S. interest in dominating Middle Eastern oil as also extending to the horn of Africa.<p>(...)<p>Policy motivations  simply put  have long been driven by concern with dominating Middle Eastern oil supplies by force, and with support for repressive, U.S.-friendly regimes in geographic areas (such as North Africa) that are tangential to the Middle East. With regard to oil concerns, President George H. W. Bush articulated U.S. policy toward the Middle East, explaining in National Security Directive 26 that: Access to Persian Gulf oil and the security of key friendly states in the area are vital to United States national security.  The United States remains committed to its vital interests in the region, if necessary and appropriate through the use of military force, against the Soviet Union or any other force with interests inimical to our own.<p><a href=""http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/10/24/what-the-establishment-isn%E2%80%99t-telling-you-about-libya/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/10/24/what-the-establishmen...</a><p>or this:<p><a href=""http://www.salon.com/2011/06/11/libya_9/singleton/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2011/06/11/libya_9/singleton/</a>",1330400219

As a programmer, I always measure progress as the percentage of tasks completed, whether that is bit downloaded, modules installed, mappers finished mapping, etc.<p>The mapper example is actually particularly pertinent. Hadoop's GUI shows me the progress of my M/R jobs with a bar, but it is as dependent on the amount of other tasks running on the cluster as downloading a file is dependent on the traffic in the network. There is no sane way to accurately estimate the amount of time a M/R job is going to take a priori, as far as I know. A stochastic method would be too variable and a method playing clever tricks with psychology seems especially insidious, from an engineer's perspective. You might as well replace it with an ""Are we there yet?"" button that responds to you in a soothing voice ""Not much longer now"".",1330398513

To increases in the capital value of the shares purchased which can then be sold for a net profit. Additionally holding shares (especially large numbers) gives you certain voting rights to how a company is run. This is why certain wealthy individuals are known to purchase stock in public media companies. (There are examples were some media influencing has taken place.) You can also lease your shares/work with short sellers for gains. (which is trying to earn money via speculating the movement of the share price.)<p>A bit more on short selling: (this is grossly simplified)<p>Short selling is the idea of selling shares that have not been purchased beforehand. Let's say Person A sells person B 50 shares at $1 each, however after the deal is made the share price drops to 50c each. Person A is able to scoop up the 50 shares for half the price, even though person B is contracted to buy them for $1. In effect a decrease in the share price has given Person A a profit. My example sounds a bit fraudulent (selling something that you don't actually have.) In the real world it involves leasing shares and the idea that shares will be available to buy at a later date.

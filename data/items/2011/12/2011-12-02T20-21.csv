3305633,comment,3303796,3304993,3,0,geoffschmidt,,,"Thanks.<p>I'm curious about your comment about intellectual ""property"" being a red herring. I certainly don't mean to mean to defend the current regime, but I'd be really interested to learn more about your ideas.<p>From a historical perspective, why is the notion of intellectual property any less legitimate than the notion of real property? In both cases, we are granting to a private concern the exclusive right to exploit something that used to be in the commons. Land ""ownership"" seems obvious now, but once, it seemed absurd to many people that anyone could own the space on Earth that we all occupy.<p>In the case of both real and intellectual ""property"", there is a resource from which limited value can be extracted. There are a limited number of cows that can graze in a given number of acres, there is a limited amount of money that can be made by selling a particular molecule as a drug, and there is a limited number of tickets that can be sold during opening weekend of a film.<p>In both real and intellectual property, there are multiple possible uses of the resource, and they can conflict. If I chop down the forest and plant wheat, you can't hunt there. If you make Mickey Mouse porn and promote it in infomercials, it changes who Mickey Mouse is in our culture. (Maybe we think it's in the public interest to allow that to happen, but it could definitely conflict with what Walt Disney wants to have happen, and prevent them from starting creative projects that they otherwise would have started.)<p>So it seems to me that opposition to intellectual property can't come from ""legitimacy,"" unless we also consider ownership of real estate to be illegitimate. That would be a sad state of affairs, because I think the human race would be worse off without the idea of land deeds.<p>Edit: RF spectrum is another example, I suppose -- there's a limited amount of value to extract (only so many channels), and there are conflicting uses that create different kinds of value (which applications to run on which frequencies with which propagation characteristics.) And the policy tradeoffs in spectrum ""property"" seem to be different again from those in real or intellectual property. For one thing, there's the rapid advance of technology, and the possibility of spread spectrum.",1322859307

3305630,comment,3305013,3305260,4,0,azernik,,,"WRT 2: Working memory capacity is (according to one well-regarded theoretical model) actually a series of different components - the phonological loop (stores verbal/phonological/textual data, can hold just about the seven digits of a phone number), the visual/spatial sketchpad (can hold representations of images - not sure there's as straightforward of a measure of its capacity), the episodic buffer (not so clear it exists - separate component for integrating different components), and the executive system (controls attention, attending to specific bits of input). Many of these are confirmed theoretically by constructing experiments to overload one memory component, and then checking to see what other capabilities still have spare capacity.<p>While an individual's capacity in each of these components is pretty fixed, there is some variance in what component of working memory a task exercises.<p>In addition it might be that some tasks might lend themselves to good compression. For example, an even lightly experienced programmer thinking about a for loop might not require one ""slot"" of phonological memory each for the index, start, finish, and label, but could rather represent the entire structure as ""for loop"" in their phonological memory, this single unit acting as a reference to the long-term memory representation of iteration. In this way, while working memory in its raw form is rather constant over different types of tasks, the actual amount of semantic information it contains may vary widely with task domain.<p>Lastly, mnemonic strategies matter <i>a lot</i>. For example, it might make a big difference to a music learner whether, when sight-reading, they process a piece in their phonlogical loop (""the notes are A-G-G-A"") or in their visual-spatial sketchpad (""This bunch of dots is the shape of the tune on the page"").",1322859273

To anyone who doesn't have the kind of mental illness required to put themselves through life in a startup (anyone who wishes for long hours, continuous stress, a feeling that how much you do is not enough even when you win is probably some form of mental illness but I figured it's easier not to worry about it as I can't change it) probably shouldn't.<p>That said, if you have an idea that keeps you at night, or a problem that annoys you so much that fixing it is easier than letting it continue annoying you, then go ahead. I am the kind of person that sees something not working and think ""I can fix that"" which, for some problems, eventually moves to ""I HAVE to fix that""... and all my startup entrepreneur friends have the same kind of feeling.<p>... but yeah, the financial freedom makes things easier. Wealth, however, didn't at first. A lot of money at a young age was really tough to manage. IF you happen to get the lucky gold ticket, don't touch the money for about a year. Just see what MODEST improvements you want to make to your life instead of going out and blowing the money. That way, the money will last longer and ensure that you can live worry free and build the next great startup.",1322857191

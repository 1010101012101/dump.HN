I don&#x27;t use Chrome, mainly because I don&#x27;t like it, and it doesn&#x27;t allow as much customization as Firefox; it also seems to try to prevent me from doing things that Google doesn&#x27;t like, like downloading Youtube videos.<p>I sympathize with people&#x27;s suspicion of advertising worming its way into Firefox. And as the worms bore, there&#x27;s a danger that Firefox as we know it could disappear in place. If Mozilla allows its survival to depend on advertising, it will be difficult for Mozilla to oppose advertisers.<p>But my greater fear is that Firefox could disappear altogether. I really don&#x27;t see how such a large organization of paid people (and I do <i>not</i> begrudge them their livelihood) can exist without either advertising, paid use, or some kind of consulting. Paid use isn&#x27;t looking good. I suppose it helps that Firefox is vaguely an anti-trust antidote for Chrome.<p>Years ago I felt uneasy about gmail&#x27;s increasing awareness of me as me. As that unease grew over the years I thought about alternatives. Eventually I chose a paid alternative, and I&#x27;ve been happy with it for a few years.<p>I&#x27;m feeling uneasy about Firefox now. Not so much about the danger of it pimping for advertisers, but about its very viability. And I&#x27;m thinking about alternatives, because as much as I&#x27;d like to, say, pay for some version of Firefox that ensures its survival, I have zero control over whether that will ever be on offer.<p>PrivateFox, from the article, is interesting, despite its problems, but it still depends on Mozilla&#x27;s survival.<p>What I&#x27;ve been gravitating toward is uzbl (which is ironically <i>un</i> usable for most web users today), or something like it. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbl</a> <a href=""http://www.uzbl.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uzbl.org/</a><p>It has its own existential issues, being mainly today lack of users, which would matter later when the uzbl devs run out of interest and retire or otherwise move on. What I like about the idea of it is that it&#x27;s minimal and composable, a la the Unix philosophy. The composable part would take much more work on my part than merely installing a Firefox addon. But in the end it would be <i>possible</i> (if difficult) to create my own browser, which Firefox and its addons make easy.<p>uzbl as is will never be an alternative for most web users (although some packaging of common features could appeal to a slightly larger group). But small niche projects do live on, and I&#x27;m hopeful for uzbl.<p>My other alternatives are along the lines of text browsers like lynx or links2, but those are options for a true, advertising/surveillance dominated web dystopia. Still, they&#x27;re on the list.

It&#x27;d be terribly restrictive for your users if they can&#x27;t write about <script> tags on a technical forum without munging it.<p>And you&#x27;re still not safe. All the characters needed for an SQL injection attack, for example, commonly occur in normal English usage. All the characters needed for XSS commonly occur too, so you&#x27;d need more restrictive filtering.<p>And have fun when a bug that causes your filter to be more restrictive than it should now means data is unretrievable because you&#x27;ve just stored the sanitised output of your buggy filter.<p>Once you&#x27;ve dealt with that, you&#x27;re still facing the issue of changing filtering requirements: What is safe for HTML may not be safe for your CSV export. What is safe for your PDF generation may not be safe for your HTML generation, and vice versa. Suddenly you&#x27;re asked to pass data via an API, with different expectations of what a &quot;safe&quot; value contains. Boom.<p>In other words, if you believe that what is in your database is safe from causing security problems, you&#x27;ve lost. You need to treat every piece of data that may possibly contain user input as a potential cause of problems whenever you output it or pass it on anywhere, whether or not you&#x27;ve (attempted) to validate and restrict the input.<p>A typical example I used to have to deal with: Mail systems. HTML that is entirely safe when downloaded and rendered by a mail client that contains the HTML in a document that is just for that one e-mail, can leak data all over the place and compromise the users account if left unfiltered when rendered on the web server. You can&#x27;t insert it pre-filtered into the database without inserting the raw content too because the user may want to download it.<p>And because the only reasonably safe filtering method is white-listing tags and CSS due to evolving standards, you will regularly have to revise the filters and add functionality and people will be <i>very</i> annoyed if their e-mails still don&#x27;t render correctly after you&#x27;ve fixed the bugs (and if you have to tighten the filters again, you don&#x27;t want to have to re-filter all the data).",1397485269

7586190,comment,7584900,7584900,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"Two things:<p>1. Reinventing the wheel<p>Does anyone here remember how Firefox started? It was one guy who was sick to death of how bloated the Mozilla browser had gotten, and just wanted something that worked. PrivateFox is essentially the same thing, except instead of a bloated browser platform, we have a bloated world-wide web, and we&#x27;re trying to &quot;thin it down&quot;.<p>What Doc is suggesting is not only spinning up yet-another-Firefox, but that we should have to <i>pay</i> for the privilege of having a browser experience which isn&#x27;t incredibly annoying and frustrating. I&#x27;m from the Open Source community. We don&#x27;t pay for our code, we download it for free and give it away, because it&#x27;s just what you do as a good person. It&#x27;s given away by people on their personal hosting or by university mirrors and other donated resources. What we don&#x27;t do is try to extort cash from users so that they can have a half-decent experience getting and using our content.<p>2. The web is not consumer culture<p>It seems that Doc is certain that the way we currently consume content on the web is good, and permanent, and we have to work <i>around</i> what&#x27;s on the web and how business is done today. Doc shows many examples of how we should pay for our web content - either in a proprietary browser, or crowdfunding, or &#x27;direct consumerism&#x27; - consumer culture without the need for advertising, essentially.<p>I didn&#x27;t get on the internet to <i>pay</i> for a <i>web browser</i> that gives me the <i>privilege</i> of <i>non-annoying content</i>. I got on the internet because somebody paid to provide me a service, either out of generosity, or after being paid by me for some other good or service. Game servers funded by game sales. Journals funded by the top 1% of power users. Chat servers hosted by donations or for free. Porn sites funded by member subscriptions (yes, I went there).<p>There are many ways to get paid for the services or content you provide. Advertising is the most annoying, most deceptive and most harmful way to do it. There is no reason we have to put up with the status quo and accept ridiculous websites with shitty content and a bad user experience just because they&#x27;re &quot;free&quot;. I say fuck the ad industry. I really don&#x27;t need most of what&#x27;s on the web. If I really needed it, I would pay for it, same as with everything else in my real life.<p>I don&#x27;t live in a home with &quot;featured content by name brands&quot;. I pay my rent. I don&#x27;t drive a free car &quot;featuring new technology by ZomboCom Inc&quot;; I pay off a loan. I don&#x27;t drink free sodas with e-ink wifi-enabled rolling banner ads; I pay the $1 for my damn soda. There is no need to support everything you consume with advertisements.<p>--<p>Paying for a browser that specifically gives me a non-shitty browsing experience is the equivalent of telling the ad industry you love them so much you&#x27;re willing to <i>pay them off to stop the onslaught of ads</i>. I have another way of telling the ad industry what I think: by boycotting all websites with advertising. I&#x27;m not going to miss the lack of content, either; because you can&#x27;t miss what you don&#x27;t know exists.<p>I propose a browser add-on that disables all hyperlinks to sites that are funded by advertising. This would create a smaller, more intimate, more content-oriented internet. It would encourage community and sharing, and increase the quality of content. It would reduce unnecessary noise and distraction. And it would force content producers to actually find out what users find worthwhile, and if they really want to pay for it, in one way or another.",1397484352

I&#x27;ve seen the whole spectrum.<p>YC could pick its crowd at random (not to imply that it does; it doesn&#x27;t) and it would still work. A few bozos would get in and be likely to fail, but it wouldn&#x27;t be remarkable considering the statistical noise already in the startup game.<p>Venture capital is a feudalistic reputation economy, and YC is a case of Paul Graham monetizing his reputation. Just being YC establishes that a startup has real potential and puts it ahead of the teeming masses. Paul Graham wouldn&#x27;t have to do anything to make YC a winning trade for him and the startups.<p>Before anyone says I&#x27;m being unduly cynical, let me fill out a few of my points. First, Paul Graham earned much of that reputation. He&#x27;s a good writer, he understands Lisp at a deep level, and his technical chops are strong even by engineer standards and put him ahead of 99% of financiers. Second, I&#x27;m sure that YC&#x27;s picks are better than its rejects. Third, I&#x27;m sure he worked really hard on the YC program. My point is only that he doesn&#x27;t have to. He could pick startups at random, do absolutely nothing, and it&#x27;d still work, financially speaking.<p>Can anyone replicate this? Probably not. Paul Graham deserves credit for carrying the banner. In 2002-4, the mainstream business world had written startups off and people believed there&#x27;d never be another 1990s-style tech boom (which was mostly froth, but had a lot of genuine substance). Paul Graham pointed people back to the truths that the dot-bomb-shocked business mainstream was prepared to discard, like (a) that technology really matters, (b) small businesses can be extremely efficient, and (c) smart people require a different management style that most corporations don&#x27;t get. He deserves a lot of credit for keeping the banner in the air in the gloomy early and mid-2000s. That right move, on his part, is a major reason <i>why</i> he has a monetizeable reputation.

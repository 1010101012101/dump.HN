Changes of setting are one of the most effective ways to end bad habits and start new ones. Want to wake up for sunrise and jog on the beach every day? Start the habit from day one.<p>2. &#x27;Visa-Runs,&#x27; do work many places outside of N. America/Europe, but they must be done religiously. Miss one, and you could face massive penalties.<p>3. Go with a business to maintain, not a business idea to build, and be sure to have a strong support team in the U.S., and at least a handful of well-enough connected friends in the country you choose.<p>4. It&#x27;s really tough to choose an International Health Insurance plan, but don&#x27;t let the vast array of options deter you from doing so. Sure, health costs are low in many places, but a plan with MedEvac benefits included can really provide added peace of mind.<p>5. Make friends with motorcycle or taxi drivers, and pay them very well. These guys are the eyes and ears of the city you have made home, and being on their good side is very beneficial, and enjoyable.<p>6. Compensate for time differences with prompt and reliable communication. People learn not to expect responses from you right away, but if you can establish a system where clients and partners know there will be a response in their inbox by the time they wake up, the distance is less noticeable.<p>7.

Yet the detailed verbiage of the complaint gives no evidence that they trample free speech, and if their contract terms trample innovation it is a matter of interpretation. Apple&#x27;s developer agreement bans developers from talking about the developer agreement. A bit draconian, perhaps, but hardly a trampling of &quot;free speech&quot;, and actually quite common within contracts generally. The other complaints are simply silly. What&#x27;s wrong with Apple insisting that developers not jailbreak their devices? What&#x27;s wrong with Apple approving their own security updates? And we can debate about the morality of DRM, but if you want to see the difference between a DRM-protected environment and an unprotected environment, look at the difference between the App Store and Google Play.

8899057,comment,8890463,8898668,0,0,pron,,,"Because from the way you write I see that you still haven&#x27;t read on power. Not understanding what power is when talking about sociology is like writing a physics paper saying that some balls have a &quot;propensity&quot; to climb inclined planes and neglect to mention the force applied to them because you don&#x27;t know what force is.<p>Let me start explaining this, but please read about it, because I have no intention of teaching sociology 101 here. Power can sometimes be compared to a force and sometimes to potential energy, but the best analogy, IMO, is a force field. There are different kinds of force fields (e.g. EM and gravitational) and they affect you differently based on different properties (like mass and charge). But each of us emits power and is under the influence of power all the time (and different kinds). It is possible, however, to attain more power (or lose some), often by aligning with others (you can think of it a bit like unaligned magnetic bits vs. aligned ones -- they could either cancel each other out or strengthen one another). In the end, all power -- like force -- translates to <i>influence</i>, i.e. moving people in a certain direction.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a good physics analogy for this, but people who have more power, are much less influenced by others&#x27; power (maybe it&#x27;s like momentum?), while those that have little power are basically heavily influenced and directed by the power surrounding them. What&#x27;s more crucial is that power can prevent alignment and thus ensure that some people (often groups) don&#x27;t gain more power (no physics analogy here). And what I&#x27;m saying isn&#x27;t theoretical: those processes have been studied at length by psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists.<p>When you say that blacks and white are &quot;different&quot;, but the differences -- all of them -- correspond with <i>less power</i> (power can be intelligence, it can be money it can be other kinds of things), you are basically saying that blacks are inherently less powerful on many power axes (and never more powerful on any of them).<p>Now, power is what defines social ranking (when someone has a higher social rank than another, that&#x27;s simply other words for saying he has more power), so when you say blacks inherently lack power, you are basically saying that blacks are inherently socially inferior to whites and therefore &quot;belong&quot; on lower social ranking.<p>To this you will say, &quot;less power in <i>our</i> society, but maybe not in other kinds of society&quot;, but that means that whites have built a society, that by their very nature, blacks are destined to be ranked low socially. That is, of course, what is known as a racist society, but that&#x27;s not even the truth of what&#x27;s happening, because all this time I assumed the studies you referred to found effects that are anywhere near those seen in society, which is not the case. The data points to a different reality -- our reality -- where the forces in our society are aligned in such a way that it&#x27;s very hard for blacks to increase their power, and this has absolutely nothing to do with innate properties. Of course, this, too is a racist society.<p>One thing beginners often get confused about is how power forms and works, and they imagine smoky rooms and powerful executives, and -- most importantly -- something resembling a nefarious conspiracy. That&#x27;s not how it works. Power is subtle and constant and often invisible (to those untrained to see it). It rarely requires a conspiracy, and powerful groups are an emergent property.",1421418500

They&#x27;ve over and over done stupid, short-sighted things to alienate both readers and collectors (e.g. their attempts to drive up sales from collectors with tons of variant covers) that publishers elsewhere have not. Not least their failure to get their titles more eyeballs by getting them into other sales venues (growing up Norway, I&#x27;d been reading comics for something like 10 years before I ever set foot in a dedicated comics store, as comics were everywhere so there was no need to).<p>And they&#x27;re the ones that are small bit players of questionable success.<p>> If those genres sold well, there&#x27;d be more of them.<p>If those genres <i>existed</i> in reasonable numbers in English language translations, being sold in more places like the small number of comics stores, maybe the people who would have enjoyed them would realise that comics are for them too.<p>Sometimes developing your market means taking risks. The European publishers understands this. They are not just chasing the big successes and milking them dry. You won&#x27;t see 5 Spiderman titles. Instead you regularly see variety magazines headlined by major, well-selling characters with guest series they hope to develop filling up a substantial portion of the magazines (the French language Pilote and Spirou perhaps being the most well known internationally), or short runs on entirely new series they are taking a gamble on.<p>Many, many of these titles are never profitable. Many of them are outright gambles that there&#x27;s little expectation will be profitable. Many of them are only able to stay profitable because of the main title is a massive draw. But some of those guest series become breakout successes of their own, carrying magazines filled with new guest series continuing to develop new markets and new fan bases.<p>Both of the biggest Norwegian series at the moment started life as strips and then had bit-parts with a few pages here and there in bigger magazines, until they&#x27;d developed enough popularity. When they got their own magazines, they were initially propped up by &quot;tried and true but not quite big enough for their own magazine&quot; series.<p>Several current Norwegian comic artists started their careers submitting fan-art to magazines in the 80&#x27;s, then got invited to publish a page or two, eventually got their own little series with a few pages in a bigger magazine each month, and ended up with their own magazines.<p>And if you think &quot;that&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s not breaking new ground&quot;, consider that many of these series are very different from each other. You&#x27;d find cutting political satire alongside Beetle Bailey (Billy). There was comedic parodies in The Phantom (Fantomet). And so on. A lot of material that&#x27;d never have a market in the 80&#x27;s, got a market because the publishers found it worthwhile to publish a few pages in not-very-related magazines to test the market and get reader feedback. Other material got a market because they &quot;rounded out&quot; magazines and draw fan bases that&#x27;d buy a magazine they&#x27;d not otherwise consider, even if a specific series will not stand on its own.<p>This is where you should look to figure out how to develop a culture for comics, as these are the methods that have been successful - even with potential markets a tiny fraction of the US -, while Marvel and DC and the smaller US publishers have struggled.<p>> Well, we&#x27;re talking about comics in the US here aren&#x27;t we?<p>Are we? I&#x27;m not, exactly because contrasting the US market to the European and Japanese markets reveal so many interesting differences that helps see the article in context.",1421418242

was a store with <i>comic books</i> for 
teenage boys and men and even there a fairly narrow
audience.  The store was definitely not for children,
especially not for grade school or younger girls.<p>A lesson she might have learned:  It&#x27;s a big
world out there, and some of it, e.g., the
view of women in that store, is not good, and
sometimes, too often, in life we
have to be selective.<p>It&#x27;s been a while since my brother and I were in grade
school and he was collecting comic books.  So, only vaguely
do 
I remember Donald Duck and Batman, and those
comic books
weren&#x27;t right up against the line, the other side
of which was porn.<p>Instead, say, take your seven year old daughter to

the bridal chorus<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebx9KhcnyLM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebx9KhcnyLM</a><p>with Andris Nelsons.  Of course, also
tell her the story of <i>Lohengrin</i>.<p>More?  Sure: Camille Saint Saens 
&quot;Mon coeur s&#x27;ouvre à ta voix&quot; from <i>Samson et Dalila</i><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X79OkSayPSw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X79OkSayPSw</a><p>with Elina Garancas.<p>More generally expose her to places
and media content where
girls and women are actually
doing things, good things.  E.g.,
currently there is the <i>Nova</i> program
on he LHC and the Higgs boson at<p><a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/big-bang-machine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/big-bang-machine.html</a><p>Two detectors there found the same basic
result, and one of the detector groups
was led by a woman.  That program
has more examples of women doing things.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s a lot out there 
where the women are all interested
in nose jobs, breast implants, micro skirts, and
thong panties, but there&#x27;s also a lot out
there for women being productive,
building a home and family with love,
victory over loneliness, 
being productive, and with
pride in accomplishments and
emotional and financial security.<p>Get her a copy of the classic
E. Fromm, <i>The Art of Loving</i>
which is about getting emotional
security, exchanging knowledge,
caring, respect, and responsiveness,
and a role for religion -- best thing
I ever read to understand people
and personality.<p>Maybe take her to some Saturday
classes in cooking school where
she can learn to make, say, some
really good cookies she could
make and share with her friends,
e.g., at school.  If I were 7-9 and
a girl 7 gave me 2-3 really good cookies
she had baked herself, then she would
have a good friend for years, prom dates, etc.
If she could play classical music
on piano or violin or sing opera,
even better.<p>How to get her interested in working
hard on, say, piano or violin?  One way:
Let her hear some of the music that is
easy to like.  Then let her see some people
working hard on learning piano or violin
and liking it.  Example:  A sister in law
tried to get her daughter interested in
piano.  No luck.  At the farm at Christmas,
I was upstairs working on the Bach
&quot;Chaconne&quot;, and a niece, about 7, came up
to watch.  I put my violin under her left
chin, showed her how to hold the violin and
the bow, and to draw the bow across the strings.
The next day her father asked me:  &quot;How much
is a violin going to cost me?&quot;.  It works.<p>More?  Sure:  Get her the DVD of the
Australian Ballet performance
of <i>Coppelia</i> -- it&#x27;s a total sweetheart
story, nearly all about young women,
and where nearly everyone on
stage is a young woman.  And the
actual
young women on the stage, the real
performers and not the characters they play in 
the story,
are 
examples of astoundingly hard work,
<i>productivity</i>, and, in particular,
are just fantastic as actresses,
artists, and athletes, especially
aerobic athletes.<p>Of course, at Christmas, get her all 
dressed up in some sort of a princess
outfit -- when I was that age the style was
dresses with red or black velvet with
lots of satin ribbons and bows --
and take her to a good performance of
<i>The Nutcracker</i>.  Also get her a
Nutcracker doll.  It could be one of the
happiest times of her life, make her
feel more secure as a girl,
and be a memory she will have and
value forever.<p>Also get her DVDs of some of the
movies from American Girl.  They
may also have some retail stores
it would be better for her to visit
than that fake <i>comic book</i> store.<p>For books, maybe Nancy Drew?
Or something similar but more recent?<p>Since she&#x27;s seven, a girl, and
bright, it may be that she 
could get good at French
with blinding speed -- try to
find a way.  Talk to some people
who know about how a girl of seven
could learn French.
Maybe have her join a group, e.g., where also she
could meet other girls learning French.
Maybe try a local <i>Alliance Française</i>.
Maybe try some Internet learning materials.<p>Connection with her being
a girl?  At that age, typically
girls have much better verbal
aptitude than the boys
and are just fantastic at learning
a language.<p>Be sure to have her learn <i>touch typing</i> --
one of the best skills to have in life now.
Talk to some people who know how a girl of
seven could learn touch typing, 
get her some materials, and 
pay attention her efforts,
encourage and praise them, and help her
learn.<p>Then encourage and praise her in
<i>writing</i>:  Have her start writing
on nearly anything -- letters to
grandma, how to train a kitten or puppy,
how to bake terrific cookies,
how to tie a bow tie,
how to wash out stains,
how to iron a dress,
how to sew on a button,
how to use a text editor,
how to use Facebook,
blog posts (anonymous),
etc.  Then get her started on
English grammar -- sentences,
subjects, verbs, prepositions and
prepositional phrases,
adjectives and adverbs.
Then make friends with
a high school English teacher 
(nearly all women, right?) and have that teacher
help your daughter improve her
writing.  Then have your daughter
write some longer pieces with
sections, subsections, table of
contents, figures, references,
etc. on anything:  If your family
moves, then have her write on
moving to a new house.  On
getting a puppy or kitten.
Whatever.  Get her going on
writing, then reading, the
more in writing, then more in
reading.<p>For being better in talking to her,
and to others, too, get, read,
study, think about, and use<p>Thomas Gordon,
<i>Parent Effectiveness Training:
The Tested New Way to Raise Responsible Children</i>.<p>also called <i>reflective listening</i>.<p>For more, get her several, used
will be fine, high school texts
in plane geometry, pick a favorite,
use the others for alternative sources,
and work through plane geometry
with her, that is, get the
fun of doing the proofs.  
Emphasize orthogonality and the
Pythagorean theorem:  Orthogonality
is one of the most important ideas
in all of pure and applied 
mathematics, mathematical physics,
engineering, multi-variate statistic, and 
best approximation, e.g., 
in computing, right up to how
to do ad targeting on the Internet,
Fourier theory, the fast Fourier
transform, digital filtering, etc.
Sure:  Quite generally every closed
convex set has a unique element of
minimum norm, and quickly get to
a <i>supporting hyperplane</i> with
orthogonality.  Sure, one of the
biggest results in college math
is the polar decomposition in
linear algebra and, right,
about orthogonal eigen vectors.
Can get going on orthogonality
right there in high school
plane geometry, and she likely
has all the prerequisites.
If not, in a few places take
out a few minutes and get her
caught up.<p>Give her a little on
electrons, protons, neutrons,
atoms, energy and energy
levels, and chemical bonds.
Then, right, presto, bingo,
guide her to the Internet videos of the
Eric Lander
lectures on biology at MIT, say,<p><a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-bi...</a><p>Also, don&#x27;t have her miss (get her
a bowl of popcorn for the
occasion)<p><a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/WebMedia/flash/lectures/20100419_publect_lander.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princeton.edu/WebMedia/flash/lectures/20100419_pu...</a><p>with<p>April 19, 2010,<p>Eric Lander:  &quot;Secrets of the Human Genome&quot;<p>Sure, have her watch some Brian Greene
videos.<p>Get her a freshman college chemistry

learn about NaCl, CaCO3,
C-H bonds and methane, gasoline, 
and converting O and C-H bonded
hydrocarbons to CO2 and H2O --
e.g., as in heating the house,
powering the car, flying an airplane, etc.<p>Look at the GED materials and
get her through all of them
by the time she is 8-9.  A bright
girl of seven should be able to
get through all of that in one
not very busy summer.<p>The GED materials are minimal --
in particular in addition she will need to
get through algebra I and II and
trigonometry and high school physics.<p>Then, to heck with high school --
then get some good advice and
guide her in home schooling
through, say, at least the first
two years of college.  So, for calculus,
just get her some good college
calculus books (my view of
AP calculus is that it is to be
avoided, skipped, ignored because
the authors
didn&#x27;t understand calculus very
well -- similarly for Khan Academy --
repeat, just get some good college
calculus books, period), and, sure,
make friends with a college math
prof to help her not get stuck and
to stay on track.  Then, sure,
have her do college freshman physics --
that&#x27;s heavily just what calculus
is for.<p>Then when she goes to college she will
be nicely ahead.<p>&quot;Youth is such a wonderful time
of life.  Too bad it&#x27;s wasted on

A CS graduate who is also a competent developer? Great but pretty much expected.  On the other hand if you study Design, UX/UI - now you are a wow for front-end web development. A second stand-out route would be to major in Statistics and really focus on mastering Python, R and data visualization libraries. This route would set you up to purse a data science career. In both of these routes everything that you have learned about web development continues to help you post college.<p>Also, as Patrick McKenzie and others advise, start raising your freelance rates. If you really are a solid developer and write beautiful understandable code that solves a business problem, you can probably double your rate over the course of the next few months. Then work toward doubling your rate again before you graduate.<p>My own son is 13 and I have been encouraging/nagging him to learn to code. He has the appropriate intelligence.

8898948,comment,8896219,8898641,0,0,aethertap,,,"One of the things I&#x27;m doing is attempting to use cattle in a way that sequesters carbon in the soil in the form of humus. Others have had success using a combination of trampling and long-rotation grazing practices to boost soil carbon by many tons per acre, without requiring the use of machinery. Biochar is also a promising area for investigation, because you can combine that with heat and power production to get carbon-negative energy (using something like a top-lit updraft gasifier, or TLUD). If you then add a fast-growing coppice species as the feedstock, you have a sustainable energy production system that makes effectively permanent improvements to soil while soaking carbon out of the atmosphere at a pretty rapid pace.<p>On a smaller scale, you can change eating habits so that your food comes from sustainable sources (or even grow a lot of it yourself if you have space for something like an aquaponics setup). Learning to repair things rather than replace them is another small thing that has a large impact over time, keeping stuff out of landfills and reducing the impact of planned obsolescence.<p>If you want to have a larger impact than those things (which I understand may feel like insignificant posing), look to your local economic networks. Things like getting zoning laws changed to allow for integrated living and small business areas, with walkable streets, can have a huge impact on peoples habits in terms of driving and buying things from far away. That&#x27;s getting into government territory, but it&#x27;s local government so you have a much better chance of success.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in tinkering, there are a bunch of things that can be done in the home energy arena that make a big difference. Start with improving efficiency (insulation, draft elimination, passive solar retrofits). After that, you can consider things like solar water heating, or high-efficiency wood heat for the dwelling itself. There are wood heater designs that you can build with minimal skill that are very close to as good as you can possibly get in terms of efficiency (look into rocket mass heaters or masonry heaters). If you make a job out of it, you can have a large impact over a few years doing these things for other people who want to do something meaningful but don&#x27;t have the time/knowledge/resources to make it happen.<p>If you like biology/ecology, I think there is tremendous potential in the creation of passive productive ecosystems. The basic idea here is that we take space that is currently under-utilized (mowed medians, frontages, hillsides, unused lawns etc.) and plant them up with productive perennial species like fruit and nut trees, herbs, and various vine crops. Combined with minimal support from municipalities for allowing safe access, these kinds of areas can have a big impact on a lot of positive things - building connections in a community, providing a significant source of otherwise hard-to-get fresh fruit and nuts that&#x27;s free for the taking, and at the same time providing habitat for wild animals to recolonize places we&#x27;ve been keeping functionally sterile at great expense. This is the other thing I&#x27;m doing on my property - creating a permanent productive forest environment (the cattle are part of the preparatory steps, and will gradually be phased out in favor of a tree-based ecosystem). It&#x27;s easier to do than it sounds, if you just work on it a bit at a time. If you don&#x27;t have land available, you can often find someone who does.<p>A business model I&#x27;m exploring in this space is the &quot;urban farmer&quot; or &quot;urban forest farmer,&quot; who basically leases unused lawn spaces in cities and turns them into productive systems. The farmer would then harvest and sell the produce locally to make the profit - possible through a CSA arrangement. If you have the people skills, you can potentially get a large percentage of suburban or low-density urban properties involved for a given area, and you end up having &quot;farm land&quot; to use for local food systems and ecological remediation. It eliminates the need for mowing and other busy work for the owners, and they get a cut of the produce as a side benefit. It would also hopefully get neighbors talking to each other as they see the neighborhood transform, which combined with better zoning laws would probably lead to some local businesses springing up to support either your farming activities or things that follow from there (local restaurants, food preservation shop, etc).<p>There are a lot of options for improvement when you start looking at how things are being done today. Some of these things probably won&#x27;t pan out, but others will, and the fact that we&#x27;re starting now rather than waiting for somebody else means we&#x27;re leading by example. Others will follow as they are able when they see what&#x27;s possible.<p>I think the biggest thing is to change your mindset to think in terms of snowballing passive systems. Every time you make a wood heater for someone that uses half (or less) of the firewood to cleanly heat a space, you potentially save that quantity of energy every year after <i>for the life of the home</i>. Each productive tree you plant provides 500-2000 lbs of food every year for <i>generations</i> if it&#x27;s maintained, and the maintenance is minimal. Half an acre of coppiced firewood species like Black Locust can provide the majority of the annual heating needs for a modest, well-insulated home <i>forever</i>. That&#x27;s how you can maximize the impact of your labor - build things that keep on giving after you stop working on them.<p>There are loads of people out there right now who can&#x27;t find a decent job. If we can make a viable business models for doing this kind of work, we&#x27;d have a huge force multiplier there as well by inspiring them to take on similar jobs, or even doing work that complements our own work.",1421417363

Want to create a button? Draw a button. Want to change its script?

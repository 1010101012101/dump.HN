It's extremely easy to cherry pick the data.<p>Take this quote from one of the papers noted by the author:<p><i>The studies summarized in this review show that the recommendation for increasing dietary fiber in Western communities would not be expected to have any adverse effect on mineral absorption if we increase not only the intake of fiber, but also the dietary intake of other food components such as protein (both vegetable and animal protein) and ascorbic, citric, and oxalic acids (in fruits and vegetables). The adequate intake of minerals, fat, and simple sugars are maintained with this type of diet. The recommendations should be best interpreted in such a way as to prevent the consumption of excessive amounts of phytate, particularly for those whose mineral needs are great. Further studies are still needed in this field in order to understand the conflicting results published in the literature regarding the effects of fiber on the utilization of minerals; however, the studies reviewed in this article may give us an idea of the complexity of mineral availability in fiber-rich, phytate-rich diets.</i><p>From a cursory skimming of the references that even your author gives, it seems like only diets exceptionally high with phytate are problematic -- in areas such as Iran.  I don't think the typical US diet (even at a 1 std dev) is likely to approach a problem.  And as noted here, with reasonable diet modification, the problem can be almost completely mitigated.<p>I'm not a nutritionist, and don't think about this daily, but the evidence just isn't compelling.  And often completely contradictory.  Given that, if whole grains in moderation lead to a better quality of life, that's my choice.<p>Of course if we see that most NBA athletes and centurians avoid whole grains, I would strongly reconsider.<p>With that said, I actually don't eat many whole grains, and eat more fice.

2787992,comment,2787393,2787393,1,0,chipsy,,,"Two easy rules I've settled on for diet, mostly revolving around GI:<p>1. Regularly add vinegar(any kind) to most meals, or drink it diluted in water. This dramatically lowers effective GI of carbs so overconsumption is more difficult. It also has some (complex, but mostly positive) effects on body acidity and digestion. Vinegar has been documented for its properties since ancient Greek times, so it's one of the most proven aids around.<p>2. The _context_ in which things are consumed matters more than the _amount_. For this I mostly stick to a single rule: Meals should be either ""carb meals"" or ""saturated fat"" meals. Preferably neither, but never both.<p>Saturated fat acts to raise effective GI and this is the main source of the ""badness"" in meals like pizza, ""super"" burritos, burger+fries, macaroni+cheese, etc. But sausage and sauerkraut, or cheese in a green salad are relatively low-impact combinations, despite having a nominally high level of sat-fat. Similarly, even drinking a can of Coke(massive sugar-carb dose, the worst kind) can be OK once in a while, but if you have Coke with lard-soaked fries or full-fat ice cream you're signing up for the sick train.<p>There are tons of other contextual rules you can stack on for caffeine, gluten, the best types of fats, the best preparation methods, etc. but the sat-fat/carb one is the biggest bang-for-buck one I've found, and combining that with vinegar to mitigate the worst-case situations I can remain pretty flexible about what I'm eating.",1311207248

It's a voluntary exercise (any exercise is better than no exercise) and they like to do it as a team. They're not embarrassing anyone or making fun of other people.<p>Pushups are a great workout. If you can't do 100. Do 1. Then do 1 more the next day. Then one more. No weights. No gym. No excuses. Just you and your body. Commit to it and then do it. When pushups get easy, there's a ton of variations you can try. One of the greatest and simplest exercises ever.",1311206779

In its implementation, ClojureScript adopts the strategy of the Google Closure library and compiler, and is able to effectively leverage both tools, gaining a large, production-quality library and whole-program optimization. ClojureScript brings the rich data structure set, functional programming, macros, reader, destructuring, polymorphism constructs, state discipline and many other features of Clojure to every place JavaScript reaches.",1311206440

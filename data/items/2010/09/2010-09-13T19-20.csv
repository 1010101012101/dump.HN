But somehow ""the playa would provide"" and people would come help you complete it.  And ""gifting"" isn't about cheap trinkets or bartering.  It's about giving your time and skills to people that could use it.  I've helped repair an engine, build structures, painted a boat, clean up trash, and more.  People have fed me, taken care of me while dehydrated, given me rides, bought my ticket, etc.<p>In some ways, it's helped me be more adventurous with creating a business.  Sometimes you need to take that leap of faith that resources will show up.<p>I came back the first time and literally cried at seeing all of the trash barrels overflowing in my home town on garbage day.  (EDIT: I live 2500 miles away.)  I also spent months researching all sorts of things I was excited by as a boy.  Lots of people go to Burning Man to ""rage"" and take lots of drugs and go wild.

Maybe more like an alcoholic who drives drunk.<p>Anyway, I like your analogy as an answer to the mosquito vs. malaria blame game, but it may be impossible to directly compare a mosquito-inflicted death to one caused by a human in any fashion.<p>In short, blame is irrelevant...human rights trump mosquito (or malaria) rights, IMNSHO, so if we could somehow destroy mosquitoes (and/or malaria) entirely in the sub-Saharan region, that'd be entirely alright with me, to hell with the consequences (some argue it would impact other wildlife, as mosquitoes are a food source for birds, as well as a pollinator for some plants, and those birds and plants are a food source for bigger animals, etc.).",1284407191

Remember, this is all relative to London:<p>* SF is super, super cheap. My apartment was the same size for half the price and in a much better area.<p>* Food is so plentiful and cheap, it is EVERYWHERE. The portion of my budget devoted to food fell by 75%, even though I eat out all the time. The range of cuisines and the quality compares well, too, even though London is 10x the size.<p>* I don't go out to gigs much, so no claims here.<p>* Cabs are about 20% of the price, and you can summon them with an iPhone app. Amazing.<p>* Parking: I've never driven in either city.<p>* Size: no question that people who live down-peninsula might as well be in another country. See: public transit.<p>* Commute: this does indeed suck. My solution was to quit and get a job in the city itself.<p>* Dirty: no question, it's dirty. And very poorly governed in a number of ways. London has much more adult supervision.<p>* Public transit: hoo-boy is it terrible. Ameliorated somewhat by cabs being cheap. But if you want to get down-peninsula caltrain is ridiculous for somebody used to London-style commuter rail.<p>* Haight: ...then don't live in the Haight? Every city has bad areas.<p>* Tourist traps: similarly, every city has these. In San Francisco they are usefully separate from the areas I actually like to visit, so I can ignore them, while Leicester Square/Oxford Circus are both working districts AND tourist traps.<p>* Neighbourhoods: London is a dense core with hundreds of miles of pointless, characterless suburbs in zones 3 through 5. San Francisco has distinct, self-sufficient neighbourhoods with totally different characters. This was one of the biggest differences I found when I moved. As for block parties... well, we had one two weeks ago, but I don't really see the point of them anyway. I don't hang out with people primarily based on their geographical proximity to me.<p>* Seasons: it's always spring! I grew up in the tropics, so I always hated winter, and San Francisco doesn't have one, so that's fine with me.<p>* Tech: the city is full of nerds. But there's also an incredibly vibrant and mostly unpretentious tech-arts scene, which I love.<p>Finally, as one of The Gays, there's no city more inclusive and open-minded of everyone -- sometimes hilariously so.",1284405439

For a big city, San Francisco is incredibly small. I like that I can walk from my favorite fried chicken place in SOMA to my favorite ice cream place in the Mission in a matter of about 40 minutes. Luckily, there are plenty of pockets outside of the parking nightmares and pay-by-the-pound rent to seek refuge (in my case, San Mateo).<p>Sure, the traffic will make you wish you had a rocket launcher on the roof of your car.

With XP dropping the same year, Windows consumers were running a really well optimized OS compared to an OS X that needed a lot of work.<p>Apple has come a long way since those dark times to having a truly enviable OS.  They quickly got 10.1 out the door and 10.2 and 10.3 shipped in around 1-year increments (with 10.4 shipping a year and a half after 10.3).  Apple really did a lot of work and, at this point, I don't think anyone questions Apple's ability to push a great OS, but there were some really bad times.<p>I remember people questioning whether it was that the Mach kernel was just inherently slow (igniting lots of micro vs monolithic debates) or whether the compositing window manager was worth anything or coming up with theories that it was because Apple replaced Display PostScript with Display PDF to get around Adobe licensing or whatnot.  Today, the majority of Mac users probably never experienced that bad time of trepidation when the future of the Mac platform was in doubt.  Today, it's really great to be a Mac user.  It's hard to imagine a time when Apple's products were so fringe.  At nearly 10% of the market (and nearly all of the premium market), Apple feels so strong and people really know Apple (both for computers and other devices).<p>Kudos to Apple for taking the risk and getting through the bad transition to what is a really wonderful OS.

Django has too much boilerplate for my taste ... but I like that for complex projects where I need to tweak things.",1284405040

That's the answer, might have a little problem with the sun burning out before the computation completes, but by that time you should be able to relocate using a warp drive. Good luck on the interview.<p>edit: Ah I just figured out the pruning algorithm that will solve it. And that's the answer too, I just gave it to you in the previous sentence if you read carefully. Obvious once you think of it, not until then. I doubt many people would figure it out without a hint. And with a hint only clever ones could get it. As a screening to send in resumes? Pretty useless.

That kind of logic should be left to your models/views. I know there's a lot of disagreement in the community over the lack of real Python code in your templates, but it just encourages sloppy spaghetti. Forcing you to not rely on advanced logic in your templates makes you a better developer.<p>I do agree that migrations should be a part of core/contrib, given how common of a use case they are. I don't agree that it makes it less useful. You need plenty of gems to get Rails to satisfy many common use cases. No framework plugs all the holes, you always have to extend. Both django and Rails make getting and using those extensions hilariously easy, so there's really no barrier to entry for any developer.",1284404742

The scalability issues I was talking about were seen at a fortune 500 company where a Rails app was used for an internal only application.<p>The major issues with scaling was that Ruby in general is absolutely horrible in managing memory, and was constantly having to be restarted. We ended up replacing the app with one built on top of Java which instead of requiring 6 servers with load balancer in front of it, to just 2 servers, one for the front-end and one for the backend. Java served the needs much better, faster, and didn't require the same amount of administration to constantly make sure that everything is still running properly.<p>Could the same have been done with Rails? Maybe. Are we happier with the Java based solution, its stability and speed? Yes absolutely.",1284404597

It might be the epitome of bad urban design in America -- and, mind you, it's up against some pretty stiff competition. There's a handful of blocks in Palo Alto which might actually be worth living in, but unfortunately the locals all understand that and prices are through the roof.<p>SF and Berkeley were like visions of heaven compared to the South Bay, and I tried to visit when I could, but tptacek is right: They are incredibly far away. You spend all your time driving in the Bay Area. One day I realized that just visiting my nearest friends was a thirty-five minute one-way car trip, even at 2am.

UofC and Berkeley are both in the middle of an urban zone that existed before the school and have had to fight for every square foot of campus space; at both places it is hard to ignore the fact that you are crossing chunks of ""city"" to get between some university buildings.",1284404490

Instead of limiting this to crypto currency mining (a fair application, FWIW), why not approach this with the idea that people plugging in their phones every night could easily constitute the <i>largest</i> distributed supercomputer ever built? Everyone has the same nightly ritual: Wake up, use phone/tablet/device, plug in at night. Once it&#x27;s plugged in, your phone charges to 100% after a few hours, and then essentially sits there for x hours effectively doing nothing (that&#x27;s a little sensationalist, but it highlights my point). Folding@Home, et al have done this before, but the silver bullet here is that no one turns off their phone when it charges at night - perhaps to maintain the off chance they receive a random 4 AM phone call.<p>Now if you can combine this with an SDK (say... something Javascript based) that makes it easy to write/deploy compute jobs/&quot;apps&quot;, you have a real distributed computing platform. You can also maintain security by using a similar proof-of-work scheme that bitcoin uses to prevent fraudulent mining.<p>The real challenge here is incentivizing people to run your app. Here&#x27;s my sign up form for an early private beta for anyone who is interested.<p><a href=""http://stynt.co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stynt.co</a>",1395904620

7479030,comment,7475278,7475440,2,0,donavanm,,,"Lets put some math on the network costs. An oft quoted cost is $1/mb at p95 for decent transit. 1 mbs * 2,592,000 seconds = 2,592,000 mb per month, / (8  * 1024 gigabytes) = 316GB transferred per month. Dividing our $1 / 316GB = $0.0031 per GB transferred _at a constant 1mbs_.<p>However most networks have sine wave pattern diurnal utilization. A common peak to average ration would be 3:1. Our $0.0031 is effectively the rate for an average of 1mbs. To get that average rate we&#x27;ll be paying about 3x, or $0.0093 per GB transferred. So we&#x27;re paying $0.01 per GB for the transit alone. This is also in a major metro area in North America. Transit costs can easily be 3-10x in EU or 10-20x in AP.<p>On top of that there&#x27;s capex and opex for that 10gb port. Assuming you&#x27;ve got some decent scale you&#x27;re going to get 96 10gb ports in a $300,000 to $500,000 router, or $3-5,000 per 10gb port. You need ports both north and south, so you get 480gbs throughput per chassis. But you can&#x27;t run above 80% util, so call it 384gbs of peak throughput. Opex for rack position, data techs, power, etc will cost $2,000 to $5,000 per month. Amortized over 36 months let&#x27;s call it $10,000 to $17,000 per month all up.<p>That 384gbs peak throughput is actually more like 128gbs averaged over the month. At 128gb/s average we transfer about 41,472,000 GB per month, or $0.00024 to $0.00041 per GB. Now double that cost &#x27;cause routers actually come in pairs for fault tolerance. So we&#x27;re paying $0.0005 to $0.0008 per GB of transit connectivity.<p>And how many hops are there back to your application? I&#x27;d hazard around 6 by the time you go transit -> edge -> border -> core -> dc -> agg -> tor. Paying for that internal network infrastructure is going to add $0.0030 to $0.0050 to our bill. All up that gets us to $0.0128 to $0.0151 per GB transferred from our host to a third party network.<p>Expanding the error bars lets round to $0.01 to $0.02 of network costs per GB that we deliver. To get these prices you&#x27;re going to have a capital budget of tens of millions per year. OpEx would be at least $500K, or more likely a million plus, per month. If you can actually beat my pricing I&#x27;m hiring and or would like to subscribe to your news letter.<p>Apologies if I missed something in the math. I had to do some mental acrobatics to go from dollars per gb/s to dollars per GB/month.",1395904294

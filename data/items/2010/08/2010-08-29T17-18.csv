Western media often has inaccurate perception of things going on in other parts of the world. I have found that, at times, seemingly trivial events are blown out of proportion while imperative issues go entirely unnoticed.  It might not be a premeditated or deliberate exercise, but it certainly is a big failure in part of western media in grasping the ground issues.<p>There can be no gainsaying that Twitter did a great job of spreading the news about Iranian protests around the world, but it's very much plausible that Twitter was largely of no consequence within Iran.",1283104750

1644153,comment,1643318,1644088,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I have to agree with jacquesm here. You're right that many homeless individuals can't produce a minimum wage's worth of value for an employer, and you're right that the requirement of a minimum wage then makes it nearly impossible for them to get work that has any chance of improving their situation.<p>However, jacquesm is right that the minimum wage exists as a lower threshold that prevents the exploitation of workers, and that's as true today as it was in the 1920s. Reducing or abolishing the minimum wage would certainly lead to powerful economic deflation, and while that looks great on paper, in reality it leads to lots more homeless and poor people.<p>In practice, game theory does not apply to economics as often as theorists think it does. For example, you'd think that if some employer wasn't offering a decent wage, then they'd be unable to get workers, so they're forced to maintain the same wages as everyone else. However, eventually there will be an economic depression like the one we have now, and that will result in huge numbers of able employees, and a ripe opportunity for would-be employers to exploit that situation in a way that wouldn't fix itself for decades.<p>I am an employer. And, yes, although my margins are ridiculously thin after you count up all the money that goes in to everything, the truth still is that I <i>do</i> make sure I get multiples of value from my employees (or contractors); otherwise, I simply wouldn't bother having them.<p>Homelessness and the problems of the poor are something that I think about a lot, and as I said, I have no idea what the solutions are. I do know that merely reducing or eliminating minimum wage requirements -- even only for their specific case -- is not a viable solution.",1283103599

1644126,comment,1643098,1643876,0,0,alextgordon,,,"It's not just explicit @protocols. <i>Everything</i> in Objective-C is under an implicit protocol: the code itself. Even if a method says it requires an argument of type Foo, you can usually substitute an object of type Bar, so long as Bar responds to all the messages that the method could send to Foo.<p>For example<p><pre><code>    - (void)printValue:(Foo *)foo {
        NSLog(@""%@"", [foo stringValue]);
    }
</code></pre>
it doesn't matter that printValue: <i>says</i> it wants a Foo, you can still pass it an NSTextField all the same.<p>This gets really fun when you start using -respondToSelector: Now we can do:<p><pre><code>    - (void)printValue:(Foo *)foo {
        if ([foo respondsToSelector:@selector(stringValue)])
           NSLog(@""%@"", [foo stringValue]);

The science programs provided a lot of direct interaction with professors as well as copious lab time, projects, summer internships.  Lab equipment was extensive; as it was (sometimes too frequently) put, undergrads received training on and regularly used equipment that elsewhere you might not ""get to touch"" until in a grad program.<p>It helped that the school was quite well funded/endowed.  Some big name alumni had not just or even primarily given them money, but had as much or more so given them investment advice and opportunities that paid off many fold.<p>This is an attraction of a small (often private) college.  But you have to pick carefully and ascertain that the reality there lives up to the rhetoric.<p>I'm not particularly pitching for this route as an education.  Rather, providing a specific example, as requested by the parent.<p>P.S.  Tuition was not as high as some schools, but it wasn't cheap.  However, a majority of the population received aid (often significant) of one sort or another.  If you experience ""sticker shock"" when shopping around, realize this and, if a school interests you, apply and see what happens.  (Although it's been some time since I was there, and education costs as a percentage of income seem to have grown more and more out of scale, in general.)<p>Also, while that college had many excellent areas and faculty, they also had their not so good areas and some particular lemons.  You can't just look things on a school level; you need to consider particular programs and departments, where you have strong interests.  At the same time, often part of the liberal arts experience is figuring out just what major you actually want to pursue, so don't feel certain that your interests going in are going to remain constant.<p>Finally, I should mention that the college paid fairly well and was in an area with low living costs and good schools for faculty children.  Faculty also had decent resources and the ability to take leave to pursue personal work/research.  Thus, it was able to attract good faculty.  Further, they knew coming in that the institution's primary focus is education, not research.  Your research need not suffer (then again, maybe many faculty were not of the most highly obsessed research-centered nature that also produces some ""super stars""), but you were there first and foremost to educate.",1283102120

Twenty years ago he would have been at the State Hospital; instead, he was given a small stipend and left to die on his own.  Of the six windows in the apartment, one survived his habit of throwing things in rage; there was food and nicotine liberally spattered on every surface in the apartment - and if you've never mopped a ceiling before, I assure you the pain in your shoulders is unique after the first day.

Every choice you make to spend every moment a certain way is necessarily mutually exclusive with spending it any other way, and there are only so many moments and so many things one can realistically do.<p>I'm quite positively certain that if asked to reflect on all the things I regret near death, and truly chose to entertain the question from that angle, then I would find something to regret no matter how I lived my life until that point.  There will always be could-have-beens, should-have-beens, what-ifs and maybe-if-I-did/didn'ts.<p>Furthermore, in a practical sense, life is an economically bounded experience; life in a world with finite resources, finite time, and within a society of other people always entails strong elements of concession, compromise and accommodation.  You cannot lead a purely hedonistic life unconstrained by material or political limitations.  What you do will always be subsumed to some extent by exigencies you would rather not have, by the needs and wants of others, by nature, and various forces you can't control.   So, I don't think it's intelligible to implore people to ""lead a life without regrets.""<p>I'm not saying there isn't wisdom in being aware that life is short, and you only get one, and that there are some things you will wish you had done if your life ends up being a lot shorter than you expected.  However, it seems to me that an important part of finding peace is acknowledging and coming to terms with the objective facts of the human condition and the inescapable psychological truths that accompany them.  Seeing your existence as it is and not as it could hypothetically be is an important pillar of peace and comfort for the soul.   The reality is, you will always have ""regrets"":  there are always infinite alternate possibilities for any conditional branch, there are practically infinite variables.<p>""Live a life you won't regret"" is the wrong way to look out at the world and your relationship to it.  A more constructive approach may be to say, ""Lead a good life,"" whatever that means to you.  It is not logically equivalent to ""lead a life about which you will never wish something could have been different.""<p>Edit: Also, it is important to emphasise the critical distinction between a) regretting that you had not done something differently, in that all it would take for you to not regret it is to have made a different - and equally accessible - choice, versus b) regretting that you could not have done something differently, in the sense that you wish circumstances or conditions had been such as to make possible or make more likely that you could have made - and actually carried out - a different choice.",1283101755

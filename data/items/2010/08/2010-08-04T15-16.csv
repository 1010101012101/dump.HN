There are multiple ways to avoid that crowd, starting with staying out of Murray Hill.<p>The thing I love about New York is the inherent challenge.  You're among some of the most competitive people in the world who love nothing more than to squash your idea.  And if you manage to convince those people or rise from their negativity, you know you're onto something.<p>I view it in many ways as its own little market economy with (close to) perfect competition among commodities.  If something facing fierce competition (like restaurants, for example) can hold its own, you know there's some quality behind it.",1280937592

I think the future might consist of a few high-end boutique agencies/collections (probably all owned by Getty), and well-run microstock sites built on the backs of hobbyists.

Instead of trying to setup one big central site and attract photographers to it, you should create a product that can be hosted or installed on photographer's own site.<p>George Lepp was mentioned earlier in the comments. He set up sales directly from his web site and does not have to pay to stock agencies. I bet many photographers would like to do the same - a niche your platform / product could fill. It should be beautiful out of the box, yet customizable since photographers are artist and sure they will want their own look and feel. It should offer easy integration with payment systems (major point of pain), help with discoverability (built-in SEO), embed watermarks for free demos and what not (you should know that way better than me).<p>In other words don't try to be next Amazon, Zappos, eBay or Yahoo Shopping of stock photos. Be shopify.com of stock photos.<p>Different model, different niche, maybe even different requirements to the product, but still something to consider. Good luck with your endeavors!",1280937574

1574708,comment,1557061,1574622,0,0,lispm,,,"Let me add the hidden cost of mining. From the Areva wikipedia page:<p>---
Areva has been criticised both in Niger and the west for a neocolonial relationship with the former French colony, having obtained monopoly rights to mine uranium for nearly forty years, while Niger remains (as of 2006) the least developed country in the world.[16] There has been specualtion that Areva was the primary vehicle (and motivation) for French government involvement in the Nigerien government's poor history of democracy and human rights since the late 1960s.
Areva argues that it is a good steward of the environment and a partner in development with the Nigerien people. The company stresses that most workers it directly employs in Niger are locals, and that the revenue generated by these mines is the single largest foreign exchange source for Niger.[17] When the population of Niger was exposed to a serious famine in 2005, Areva donated 130,000 euros in June 2005 to the food crisis coordination group of Niger, and 120,000 euros in July in the form of two planes loaded with food and organized by Bernard Kouchner's Réussir NGO. Nigerien critics point out that this aid amounted to 0.05% of Areva's annual profits of 428 million euros.[18].
In January 2008, a Swiss human rights group awarded Areva's Niger operations their ""2008 Public Eye Global Award"" for the ""worst company in the world"", citing charges of radioactive pollution, poor working conditions, and the deaths of a number of workers.[19] The Tuareg based rebel group fighting in the Arlit area has echoed these charges.

It seems that once a company becomes undisputed champion of a particular area they redeploy their resources trying to find something else to dominate.<p>Or they realize that their domination is fragile.<p>Google worried about the mobile space because it was an area where they could be cut entirely out if one commercial interest dominated, even if their product was what users wanted, had the best features, whatever. With Android it's notable that it's <i>intentionally</i> a very ""fragmented"" ecosystem, and the reality is that any of the vendors have the full right to pull Google hooks right out of the product if they so desired.<p>One company dominating mobile is a threat to their search business in a way that could completely undermine their entire business model, especially as the mobile space continues to gain relevance. Note that Android did originally target the RIM ecosystem as the original indications were that RIM would dominate.<p>Google worries about social media in the same way: To a lot of people Facebook is, sadly, becoming ""the net"". Businesses, from big to small, advertise their Facebook page more than even their own websites. People email and message on Facebook, game, read and post reviews, and so on.<p>It is a serious threat to search, which of course means it's a threat to advertising: Google's model is built around a long-tail, very distributed web, and Facebook is completely turning that upside down.<p>I think Google has far less interest in dominating these areas than they want to simply shake things up to avoid anyone else dominating.",1280934489

Indeed perhaps it was because of that institution that I was able to even think such thoughts, and have such realisation and gain such understanding about such a great picture as an entire institution.<p>We should indeed find ways to improve our schools and perhaps even find such ways in this big picture scale. But you can not simply condemn this institution through some rhetoric. She says nothing specific and hardly offers any suggestions seeing as she is fresh from this institution and would perhaps know better than more how things can be improved.<p>And I submit, that she is unaware that she owes so much to that institution and that institution has offer her so much. She might not like it, but I doubt she could suggest that she is not the better for it.<p>Also, I do not think students are robots. They have plenty of freedom. Two weeks holidays every six weeks of teaching, six weeks summer holidays, then they have literature where they can be as creative as they like, and arts, and music, and sport, and plenty of afternoon free time. They hardly can be uncritical, but they do as they must learn that criticism, however truthful, has a price, especially if aimed at the powerful, i.e, teachers.<p>Unfortunately, there is no other way but to teach kids maths, how to read, biology, history, the facts and make them memorise them. If they don't remember the specifics, then their memory would improve, which I think correlates highly with intelligence, especially working memory, and they will learn plenty of other things, such as to see the bigger picture as she has. I doubt that without those literature classes she would have been able to, or without those history classes, or...",1280934437

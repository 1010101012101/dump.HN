The castle is filled with hordes of steam powered antique robots trying to capture her. While trying to find a way out, she meets a defective robot that helps her in her adventure, according to the developers website.<p>Does this seem like a Diamond Age reference to anyone? Specifically Princess Nell trying to escape from the evil Queen / her encounter at Castle Turing.",1364112512

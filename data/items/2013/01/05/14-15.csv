He says that the climate of each area is not chosen very scientifically. I don't like some of the assumptions, but I don't know enough about climate to make something better. (For example, the mount Olympus is very high: should you put some snow there like in the Kilimanjaro?)<p>A few weeks ago there was an article in xkcd:whatif <a href=""http://what-if.xkcd.com/10/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://what-if.xkcd.com/10/</a>\nthat analyze the climate of the Earth with the landmasses rotated 90.

5012769,comment,5011690,5011919,1,0,Benvie,,,"I had considered this, but it would also require the other end of it. RPython is basically compiled to C which is compiled to machine code. The ultimate output format for this needs to be JavaScript, something like the form specified by <a href=""https://github.com/dherman/asm.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dherman/asm.js</a>. So we need JavaScript (ES6) coming in one end and asm.js coming out the other end. At this point the only remaining usable pieces from PyPy are the processing that happens in the middle. Admittedly this is a huge part of it and would still be very valuable to have access to, but there's probably a better approach to this than having to redo both ends of the pipeline, and losing the ability to self-host the compilation process in a JavaScript engine (browser).<p>Perhaps pairing PyPy with emscripten would be the ideal solution for this, but that would have to be a completely new project because nothing that's currently in Continuum would be useful for that (except probably the standard library that's written in ES6 and executed in the VM).",1357397916

Most importantly, your work outside of the classroom working on films, recording bands, writing marketing campaigns with clubs or on your own was just as much of the curriculum, possibly more so. I learned that only a small percentage of knowledge was coming from my professor at the front of the room but from the people around me and the work I was doing on my own.

The intended audience was sitting near the cutting edge and was assumed to be sophisticated. Data validation could be left as an exercise for the reader in good conscience.<p>This audience is distinctly different from those who learned programming typing code from magazines and Shaw's current audience for whom he is simulating that experience.<p>Editorially, K&R has chosen to remain a slender tome. It has let others create fat cookbooks and ""for idiots"". Forty years on, Shaw criticizes the <i>Wright Flyer</i> by the criteria of Second World War aviation.<p>We don't hold K&R on a pedestal because of its pedagogical methods, but because of the power of the language it describes. <i>The C Programming Language</i> was a byproduct of creating a language.<p>Kernigan and Ritchie were programming.

It's efficiency in all the wrong ways.<p>Do you remember that Diaspora social networking project that received a lot of hype a couple of years ago? It was a Ruby on Rails app, and the early releases were absolutely filled with some particularly nasty bugs and security flaws. The only reason they were eventually fixed is because the code was made public, and people pointed out these flaws. There is a lot of Ruby code out there, for instance, that isn't public, yet is still riddled with the same types of problems.<p>That's not to say that the same isn't true for Python, or Java, or C#, or C++, or any other language. But we shouldn't be claiming that using a language like Ruby or Python somehow leads to more secure code. It doesn't, and it's dangerous to think that it does.",1357397512

5012748,comment,5012203,5012203,4,0,barik,,,"The short answer is: yes.<p>The medium answer is: media = real life<p>The longer answer is there's an interesting an influential bit of scientific work that might shed some light on this issue, and incidentally, it is also not mentioned in the stackexchange link above.<p>The book is ""The Media Equation: How People Treat Computers, Television, and New Media Like Real People and Places."" by Byron Reeves [0]. The follow-up work to this is found in ""The Man Who Lied to His Laptop: What Machines Teach Us About Human Relationships"", also with Clifford Nass and Corina Yen.<p>It is often the case that psychology studies simply confirm what our own intuition tells us. How often have we looked at a psychology study and said, ""Duh! Of course that would be the case."" It is much rarer to see psychology studies that would yield results completely contrary to what we would expect, and this is what makes the work of Nass et. all so exciting. The most surprising thing about these experiments were that participants, even expert computer users, were adamant that they could not possibly be influenced by a computer who has a female voice vs. a male voice, or a computer that praises versus criticizes, or heck, a computer that has the same physical color that is the favorite color of the user, but it turns out that they are.<p>It is not that people anthropomorphize computers; they clearly recognize that computers are not in fact people -- but hundreds of thousands of years of evolution have hard-wired many of our responses, which are often largely automatic even when our interactions are with computers instead of other humans.<p>As others have indicated, there is a fine line, however. Do you recall the sad Mac? [1] This was an example of the Media Equation that was applied well -- you and I and even naive computer users know that computers don't __actually__ get sick, but you can't help but think so as your first reaction when you see that icon; you might even feel a little sympathetic. Simultaneously, have you ever seen the Clippy Office Assistant? [2] It's notorious for being one of the worst examples in history of affective computing design; unlike the sad Mac, it actually will elicit anger, the opposite of what we would want in a computing experience.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Media_Equation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Media_Equation</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Mac#Sad_Mac"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Mac#Sad_Mac</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clippy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clippy</a>",1357397420

However, if there's one thing to learn from history, it's that situations change and usually in unpredictable ways.

Sure, they benefit from web-apps too, but Apple in particular gets actual revenue directly from native apps, so if they didn't have other browsers to compete with, maybe Webkit wouldn't be as shiny and cutting-edge as it is.

It's actually hard to do, because verbosity and clarity are usually at odds with each other.<p>One of the main attractions of K&R C is exactly its <i>lack</i> of verbosity, its extraordinarily high content-to-length ratio. In a very short space you learn to do a lot of sophisticated programming, and most if not all code examples fit on one page or less.<p>Of course, optimizing for conciseness has its costs, as anyone who has debugged segmentation faults knows. So you avoid some of this shooting-yourself-in-the-foot that C is infamous for by using various crutches: add an extra argument for some functions, build your own Pascal-style strings etc. And if you pass in external input then you should definitely use some of them, such as strlcpy (which is actually preferable to the four-argument function that this article is getting to).<p>But there are also lots of cases where plain old strcpy will do fine, and for simplicity sake it's better to use it.

By apologising you are supporting the fact that it was okay for the user to do what they did or that they were treated unfairly, when it isn't, because the user still can't do it.<p>If the user wasn't to blame, then by all means apologise and reassure them that the issue will be addressed.   Also clearly explain what the expectations are from now on, such as, loss of data.<p>That's my take on it, and I wont be apologising for that.

Some of them have significant amounts of C code underlying their common libraries, as well. Some of the most popular third-party libraries or modules are in fact nothing more than thin wrappers over existing C or C++ code.<p>Don't think that you're escaping C or C++ just because you're using Ruby, or JavaScript, or Python, or Perl, or Tcl, or even Java. Don't think that you aren't as vulnerable using a dynamic language as you are using C or C++ directly.<p>Furthermore, it is quite easy for dynamically typed languages to suffer from very serious security vulnerabilities.

But if you start with the bad pieces, most players will get crushed and that 5% who can do well enough buy good pieces then do even better and then crush the game.

The idea of patching the world to accommodate your needs should never cross your mind.<p>I would have loved to make this discussion about Android portability strategies. I mean, if MS-DOS 5 and 6.22 were binary compatible for device drivers, even though they used completely different device ""models"", then I am sure we can bump heads and exchange tricks for Android, iOS and other mobile OSes that are about to shatter like champagne glass on tarmac.",1290229082

When you factor in the bias of narcissism in interviewers, you'll get competent people who are skillful at reflecting the interviewers' traits back at them (such as the author, who didn't demonstrate incompetency with his first answer, but aced the interview by reflecting the cleverness the interviewer must have self-identified with as ""Google material"".)

When I left the school - and things may have changed since then - the deal was that for classes that used Turnitin you either had to submit your paper to them, or you had to submit multiple drafts of your paper (with notes and edits in them) and be open to an oral exam and discussion on any part of it, which seems like a fair compromise.<p>Personally, if I had been in a class that used it (or in a field where we regularly wrote papers), I wouldn't have submitted my papers to it.

    Port 1023
    User fji00random

rather than<p><pre><code>  knock securebox.tld 1337 1337 900; ssh -p 1023 fji00random@securebox.tld

(and for systems without a knocker installed, you can use something like <a href=""http://sprunge.us/HJHB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sprunge.us/HJHB</a> for proxyknock, which can be cloned along with the rest of your dotfiles/scripts)<p>And if you're doing public key auth, read about ssh-agent, it can store your private keys in memory so that you don't have to retype your passphrase all the time, while the ""physical"" key is still protected if stolen.

<i>realscore</i> subtracts any votes that are noted as ""sockvotes"" from the item's raw score.<p>The first few lines here won't change too much here for either comment. Obviously, the 110 point comment will have a higher base score than the 17 point comment. They're about the same age, so (expt (/ (+ (item-age s) timebase* ) 60) gravity) will be about the same for each of them. So the division will come up with a number that's a few times higher for brh's comment.<p>The interesting part is the multiplication here. I don't think either would be considered a story, so neither is being multiplied by .5; neither has a blank url, so they're not getting hit by nourl-factor<i>.<p>It comes down to the final part, whether one is considered ""lightweight"", and what the </i>contro-factor* of each is. It takes into account the number of children of the comment (the <i>visible-family</i> call). It shouldn't make a difference, though -- neither of the posts has more than 20 children, so contro-factor for both should be 1. I think I'm missing something, as what I've said wouldn't explain the ordering.<p>Notably, though, it doesn't take into either account karma or average karma of the poster to determine rank.<p>Edit: as ChaosMachine pointed out, it does take into account users' average karma: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1923716"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1923716</a> .

If you make an array, T[], where T[65] = 1 if 'A' exists and 0 if 'A' didn't exist in the first string, you can run through the 2nd string to check if T[65] was true (1) or false (0), telling you if the character in the 2nd string appeared in the first.

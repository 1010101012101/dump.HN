One that can truly challenge Apple to innovate and to continuously improve.<p>Having said that, the Palm Pre is unreleased and many questions are still to be answered; especially delicate are those related to battery and performance (""the snappy""). It also seems a bit fat.",1242817192
618340,comment,618295,618320,0,0,pieter,,,"C is the lingua franca of computer languages. You can create bindings for almost any language if you have a c library. A lot of system libraries are in fact C, not C++: think of stuff like zlib, curl, openssl, libxml, iconv..<p>Sure, if you know C++ well, you'll be able to do C, but learning C++ is that much harder than C, that it's often not worth the effort. You'll be able to interface with most libraries once you know C, even if you use any other language as your primary tool. Learning C++ won't give you that much extra.",1242817085

Most native libraries are one of the two. Even the driver SDKs are mostly build on an object oriented approach.<p>And learning C++, you will know C. Your opinion is a popular opinion among web developers and people who do not do desktop development, but in the real world, it has a lot more advantages to learn C++ instead of C.",1242815278

It relies on a mixture of paradigms that are easier learned from other languages where they are isolated. And for lolevel stuff, you are better off learning C.",1242814723

He seems to contend that side B has given up the pretense that they are trying to make the world a better place.<p>And I think you've seen some of this in statements from people like the lieutenant governor of South Carolina, when he said, ""My grandmother was not a highly educated woman, but she told me as a small child to quit feeding stray animals. You know why? Because they breed. You’re facilitating the problem if you give an animal or a person ample food supply. They will reproduce, especially ones that don’t think too much further than that. And so what you’ve got to do is you’ve got to curtail that type of behavior. They don’t know any better.""<p>Their belief isn't one that they can make the world a better place.  But rather of actual superiority (hence they shouldn't be forced to give resources to inferior people).  This I do think is a fundamental difference.",1285009188

On a simple normal-length prime like this it may not be a huge issue, but you would see a major difference with a longer focal length consisting more elements.<p>Visually, coated lenses yield more contrast. In the case of more modern (usually after the 70's) multi-coated lenses, there is also a UV-reducing layer that maintains more detail at a distances due to minimized haziness.<p>Some of my favorite examples of a classic, uncoated lens showing its effect are from the Lewis Hines photos of the Empire State Building construction.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Old_timer_structural_worker2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Old_timer_structural_worke...</a><p>There is some obvious dodging and burning done to this print in particular (the worker has been darkened compared with the cityscape in the background) but notice how much the detail fades with distance.",1285009181

1710065,comment,1709074,1709074,0,0,silvajoao,,,"I don't post very often on HN, but I like to recall my little story.<p>So I was around 6 and we had a 386 at home, with DOS. I knew the very basics to ""cd"" into a ""dir"", and type the dir name again to start the program. Of course this didn't work for every program, probably not for those I shouldn't be using :)<p>One day I saw someone playing the snake game. I asked how could I go into that program too, and it turned out I had to ""cd"" into ""qbasic"", start ""qbasic"", and then hit F5. I never questioned why, but after hitting F5, the snake game started (I think the name of the game was ""nibbles"").<p>One other day though, just before hitting F5, I read a bit of what was on the screen of ""qbasic"", which was, well, some BASIC code for the game. And at the top was a line the intrigued me:<p>CONST SAMMYS_LIVES = 3<p>I knew the snake had 3 lives on every game, and that ""Sammy"" was written somewhere on the screen during the game (English is not my mother tongue; I surely didn't know much at 6). So this time, before hitting F5, I replaced the 3 with 9, and then hit F5. Behold, I actually had 9 lives!<p>I immediately quit, started ""qbasic"" again and changed 3 to 9999999999999999999 (something like that, probably longer). I was baffled when F5 didn't start the game anymore, and a strange line appeared. I kept reducing the 9's until it worked again.<p>That day I finished the game, but soon enough I was changing the colors, removing walls, creating levels, and figuring why F5 sometimes didn't work. The rest is history :)<p>(for the sake of my uh reputation, let me clearly state I never ""coded"" in BASIC since then ;) )",1285009163
1710064,comment,1708213,1708462,0,0,chromatic,,,"What does ""mature"" mean in this context?  (The same goes for ""unstable"" and ""incomplete"".  Is Python 3 immature and unstable and incomplete because it has the GIL and no official JIT?)<p>I have no problem explaining the presence of Parrot and Perl 6 on my CV to employers willing to ask honest questions about my participation in both projects.  All of our successes and failures are visible to anyone willing to understand them.  We deliver working software every month, with continual improvements.  We review the way we schedule, develop, and deliver that software regularly.  We have a good testing infrastructure.  The software gets more and more usable and more and more useful and we manage to attract more and more users and more and more contributors.  Parrot has to walk the fine line between making architectural changes Rakudo Perl 6 needs and maintaining a stable base for Rakudo -- two desires which often conflict.<p>Yet somehow, month after month for almost three years now, both projects release usable, useful, well-tested software.  You can see the monthly improvements.<p>Does the fact that Parrot suffered a critical project personnel failure four or five years ago forever taint everything good it's done in the intervening years?  Does the fact that Perl 6 had to invent new parsing techniques ruin its suitability now?  In five years?  In twenty?  (Just how long should it take to invent something new anyway?)<p>I believe that an honest assessment of both projects as they stand right now will demonstrate that we can make and meet commitments.  What more can you ask of developers and project managers?",1285009101

1710058,comment,1708413,1709905,0,0,spokey,,,"Note that from December 1999 to December 2009, the average annual compounded rate of return for the S&P 500 was -0.6%, and the average annual inflation rate in that same period is around 2.8%. A 5% return over inflation may be a little optimistic.<p>Also, ""in the bank"" has now become ""net worth"" and our family with a 3 BR condo has now become a couple with a 2 BR that has what, doubled their investment on the condo bought in 1997?  I'm not sure that's a typical case. Even at the height of the housing bubble I think that represents a fairly exceptional return, e.g.: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USA_home_appreciation_1998_2006.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USA_home_appreciation_1998...</a><p>But you don't need to convince me. I agree with you: I'm 100% confident that there are many reasonable scenarios that lead to well over $500,000 in net worth by 39.<p>I'm just pushing back on the ""easy"" part: If this were easy more people would be doing that, but that fact is $0.5M is 10 times the net worth of the average American in the cohort we're talking about, and more than twice the net worth of the average American at the time of retirement.  By living frugally and choosing investments wisely you can certainly do it, but those are easier choices to make in retrospect than working forward.<p>(Edit: I said $500,000 is 100 times the net worth of the typical American 40 year old, but it is really just 10 times.)",1285009000

Speculate as you wish about my attractiveness, but it's just not something I'd be crazy about participating in as either a person who is posting (my lack of desire to have many strangers judging how I look) or as consuming (my assumption that anyone posting a video would simply be an ego-maniac).  Yes, those are quick and possibly unfair judgements, but with the myriad of sites out there vying for my attention, they'd be my first ones.  A tweak would be to keep quiet about the attractiveness angle and have someone Academia point that out later in a groundbreaking study of influence on ""FaceOpinionSpace"" (best I could come up with in two seconds).<p>One might need to incorporate something to ensure that users are really posting a face (Imagine a /b/ campaign called ""Post Your Penis's Opinion"").  Or maybe that last part is a whole other business idea.  Automated video analysis and Flagging of videos could help avoid this, but if it wasn't handled well I wouldn't visit the site.<p>Lastly, it would take a lot of capital.

Using an aesthetic descriptor is inherently implying that whatever you are saying is an opinion, because aesthetic descriptors <i>have no other use</i>—there is no way to ""support"" the ""fact"" that something is best, or most moral, or is the most dance-able, or tastes most nostalgic. These evaluations come from your utility function, not your model of the world.<p>All I did, here, was to add qualifiers to my aesthetic descriptors marking them as such. Frequently, I do the same to, say, a summary of a post by Zed Shaw, as a comment to that post, and people reply with ""well why didn't he just say that?"" It's bizarre to me, because these things are completely clear and never the subject of argument in <i>spoken</i> conversation—yet they seem to be points of ire almost always when online. I wonder if there's some sort of body-language cue that people normally rely on so subconsciously that they never realize they've avoided actually <i>parsing</i> any aesthetic qualifiers they've encountered, instead just inferring their meanings from analysis of tone and intent.",1285008397

I can have it delivered to my kindle in a matter of a few seconds and still not get out of bed.""  Not everyone can afford a Kindle, and most of the older texts kept by a library are not in eBook format.<p>Interestingly, the ""Internet age"" has actually returned me to my library because of accessibility and cost effectiveness.  My town is a member of the Fort Wort Public Library System, or MetrOPAC.  It links together all of the Fort Worth libraries, along with several of the suburbs'.[1]  The card issued by my city works at a couple dozen other libraries, and allows me to get a card at roughly ten more.  MetrOPAC's card catalog is online[2] and even lets me have books or other material brought from another library to my own.<p>It sounds like the ""broken"" library is the one the author went to.  Because it is a publicly-supported institution, things like a HPC cluster or other specialized tools are impractical (though I'd be there every waking moment).  Providing the knowledge to seek these out IS what a library can do.  My library is always packed, and even though my city will get about $400,000 less in tax revenue this year (declining property values), the library is fully-funded and is getting a small budget increase because the citizens use and value it.  That's what a library should be, in my eyes.<p>Edited to add: Oh, and our wireless Internet access works well. ;)<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.fortworthgov.org/library/branches/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fortworthgov.org/library/branches/</a>

It was a po-dunk high school and I had gotten into one of the top engineering universities in the US, so I was pretty satisfied with myself. But I was also a geek, incredibly coy, and completely one-dimensional.<p>I admired the guy a lot. He never bull-shitted any of the students. If he didn't like you, he'd say so. But me and him hit it off, even though he was a history teacher and I was a hard science guy. I think he always saw me for the person I could be, rather than who I was at the time. He pulled me aside, and he said ""promise me in college you'll live you're life fully."" And I knew what he meant. After getting into college, I kind of collapsed. All the work paid off, but I had so much free time, I didn't know what to do with it towards the end of high school. Hadn't asked any girls out. Never played any sports. Never found a good group of friends. I completely neglected major parts of my life.<p>So in college, I sort of reinvented myself. Joined a bunch of social clubs, even became president of one, asked girls out, got shot down, asked girls out some more, didn't get shot down, played sports, made a great group of friends (who all studied different things), and also did well in school. I became much MUCH happier (and I was already pretty happy).<p>Getting shot down - man, I learned more about myself from that experience than I have all of the science I studied combined. His point was to live through experience, not just knowledge. Up until college, I was someone who had filled his head/life with books and studying, and stuck to what I was good at.<p>What I realized was, in high school, you can't possibly know who you are. You might know a few subjects you're good at, and try to reinforce your confidence by sticking only to those subjects and hanging out with the people who do the same. Thats how you get geeks, jocks, cheerleaders, emo kids. Each group follows their own limiting ideology. You'll never see geeks into sports, or cheerleaders into science, etc, etc. At least at the school I was at.<p>But its the perfect time to just explore. To NOT get stuck in any particular group. ""Who you are"" should be a very fluid concept when you're young. And as far as I'm concerned, after graduating recently, its still a useful way to look at yourself. ""Sticking to what you're good at"" may be the way to rack up success. But you don't live through a diversity of experience that might ultimately define who you can become.",1285006721

(I would argue that <i>that</i> statement betrays a misunderstanding of what science -- or religious belief -- is.)<p>There&#x27;s no fundamental conflict between science and religious belief, even in principle. There can be a conflict between science and <i>particular</i> religious beliefs, and a conflict between a quasi-religious scientism and other religious belief, but that&#x27;s a different thing.",1441857464

We&#x27;d normally implement Prolog in LISP. Allegro still does. Neat to see it done the other way.<p>Want a fun project? Run this one through a Prolog compiler and create some LISP benchmarks.

10196070,comment,10191540,10191540,0,0,JesperRavn,,,"I think 20000 lines of code is the tipping point where code bases go from applications/libraries to frameworks.  The difference is that the objects of an application/library are expressed in the raw language, while in a framework they are expressed in the framework&#x27;s meta-language.<p>E.g. one might start out writing a machine learning library where a transformation of data is simply a function.  But in scikitlearn, transformations of data are objects that implement a transform method.  This, together with the implicit/explicit constraints on the semantics of the transform method, help create uniformity so that understanding of the codebase scales better than understanding an arbitrary collection of functions.",1441857116
10196069,comment,10195091,10195091,0,0,ridiculous_fish,,,"Thanks for writing this, it was a great read!<p>I maintain a source beautifier too [1], and it&#x27;s not as nice as I would like. One of the issues I run into is that the correct indent on a broken line is context dependent. For example:<p><pre><code>    while (someReallyReallyReallyReallyLongFunction() &&
           anotherLongFunction()) {
       loopBody();
    }
</code></pre>
is a nicer indenting than:<p><pre><code>    while (someReallyReallyReallyReallyLongFunction() &&
        anotherLongFunction()) {
        loopBody();
    }
</code></pre>
In the first case, the two conditions are aligned which makes the code clearer. Does dartfmt handle this? If not, do you have ideas on how it might?<p>Also, how does it handle invalid input? I may want to reindent my code before it&#x27;s correct.<p>Also, did you explore constraint solvers instead of a graph traversal? It seems like they would be a natural fit.<p>[1]: fish_indent, <a href=""https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/master/src/fish_indent.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/master/src/fis...</a>",1441857017

One says &quot;Mine actually works right.&quot; The other retorts, &quot;But mine runs faster!&quot; The first merely sighs.<p>Building almost nothing and using a very, high-level language definitely helps keep line count low.

A few (including Greg Chappell himself) have offered up excuses, but your perspective (Greg Chappell did absolutely nothing wrong) is unique in my experience. Richie Benaud&#x27;s reaction is canonical in this respect youtube.com/watch?v=mIL6KZox6Ao<p>The reason for near universal opprobrium is that in cricket fair play is supposed to trump strict interpretation of the rules.<p>I do agree with you in one respect, I didn&#x27;t like Brian McKechnie&#x27;s reaction either. Much more classy to remain aloof. Alternatively I would have liked to see him pick up the ball, toss it up and attempt to clear the boundary with a free hit. Why not at that stage.<p>Incidentally, amazingly enough McKechnie was a central figure in another one of the great national sporting controversies of the 20th century in a different sport entirely. Particularly bizarre given that he was never much more than a journeyman in either sport (cricket and rugby). On that occasion we were on the wrong side of history, or sportsmanship anyway. Andy Haden dived out of a lineout in injury time against Wales, and McKechnie kicked the penalty to retain our long unbeaten streak against the Welsh. But that&#x27;s another story.",1441856715

Stars are born and die in a tick of the clock, galaxies form and collide, galactic superclusters orbit super-superclusters and before the whole universe can die<p>Gravity is a non-linear theory. Different solutions to the field equations cannot simply be superimposed, so aligning the time variable of a Schwarzschild spacetime (let alone of a falling observer) with the time variable of a Friedmann solution (which describes the evolution of the universe as a whole) is a priori very difficult. I would be very careful about trusting the above statement.<p>> Imagine the lines on a ruler getting further apart the closer you get to a gravitational object.<p>Oh god. This is wrong on so many levels.<p>> Closer to the star, distances seem longer.<p>Longer than where? This seems to assume that one could move a scale from one region of spacetime to another to see it grow or shrink. But this is wrong. Distances are tied to the spacetime by virtue of the metric which is a field and hence depends on where in spacetime you are. It makes absolutely no sense to compare the metric at two different points.<p>> The more gravity, the slower time runs.<p>Slower than where? Similar to above, distant observers cannot simply compare the hands on their clocks, so in general this statement makes no sense, either. The only thing one could compare are the lengths (eigentimes) of time-like curves starting and ending at the same spacetime events (like it was done in Interstellar: One person stayed in the orbit, the others went down towards the black hole <i>and returned later</i>).<p>Also, in what geometry is all this supposed to happen? The author probably assumes a Schwarzschild geometry. But in a Friedmann universe, for instance, where gravity is strong as well, time keeps passing in the same way for all observers moving along with the matter, even as the universe might collapse (and gravity might intuitively become stronger).<p>Conclusion: Gravity is not that simple that it can be broken down to a few easy facts.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Earth#Structure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Earth#Structu...</a>",1441854572

But their hands-off approach is precisely what gives them the rational standing not to censor any website any group finds distasteful. Furthermore, the threat of censorship does not only come from governments. I don&#x27;t want to live in a world where a handful of corporations can decide what speech is allowed to be disseminated.

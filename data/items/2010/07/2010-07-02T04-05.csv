If we'd had the balls to let some of our airlines and auto companies and banks die the painful death they deserve, we probably wouldn't have to face the prospect of repeatedly bailing out underperforming companies in those (now heavily-regulated) industries.",1278046758

- Java Play 1.0 released, a popular Rails-like framework
- iPhone 4 announced, renames iPhone OS iOS, anounced iAds, available June 27, new: very hi-res screen, video chat on wifi, multitasking  
- Ubuntu 10.4 released, faster boot, dark (less orange) theme, social networking features integrated
- New MacBook Pros
- HP bought Palm, $1.2B, webOS on printers/tablets?
- Amazon bought woot, plans to stop retailing and just produce monkey rap
- Chrome 6 released, new: vp8, built-in pdf support
- Flash 10.1 released

Longer term, generally some flavor of bad. However, as others have mentioned, one silver lining in this event is that it may increase demand for some sort of pseudo-ITA replacement company upstart to slide in sideways and takeover providing this service. Perhaps new ventures will be formed to do exactly this. But there will also be chilling effects on other enterprises and projects. So it's really hard to say.<p>It definitely takes Google one step closer to a position where they can make Kayak/Orbitz-like sites a little more irrelevant. Are they all the way there yet? Of course not. Also, Google has a track record of being pretty shitty in certain areas (like customer service, especially human contact, voices and bodies, etc.) and so those are areas where they can still differentiate. Plus, there's still no sign of Google wanting to get into taking the booking orders. Just the fare/trip search. Search of any kind is something that clearly their infrastructure and scale is going to have massive competitive advantages in delivering. Booking: not really. And many OTA's and metasearch sites make their profit on booking fees and kickbacks, not really on search itself, which for them is more of a cost center (though they do sometimes monetize those use cases too in various ways as well -- this is where they will hurt the most, in medium term).<p>Also, Google has said it plans to honor the existing ITA contracts. But who knows how long or how pervasive that will be in the future. I personally know of one startup that came <i>very</i> close to signing a contract to get service from ITA and we actually backed down ultimately, in part, because of the fear of lock-in to their service. Plus they were expensive. ITA is/was a bit like the Oracle of fare search products. Good shit, but really expensive shit. At least for a wee little startup.",1278044142

I know better than to think the tree is made of the ground, however I know many people are not.<p>However he's talking mass and reneges on his statement that trees are made from the air by stating that many trees are over 50% water. Well IMO when talking about mass the majority-share counts as the subjects mass origins.<p>The plant breaks down CO2 into C + O2 via photosynthesis. The C makes up the plant. This is the simplified version he starts with, which was an ample metaphor. However then he states that the tree can be predominantly water. Meaning the plant is made up of say 60% water and 40% carbon.<p>However the plant is made up of predominantly of water trapped within cellulose membranes. If we talk dry weight, we're still talking 6 carbon atoms (72), 10 hydrogen atoms (10) and 5 oxygen atoms (80). This means roughly 66% of the trees mass comes directly from water from the ground sequestered in its cellulose.<p>This means roughly only 20% of the tree actually comes directly from carbon sequestered from the air.<p>So really, where does the plant get its mass? The ground.<p>If you're asking where the plant gets its dry weight, still the ground by ~6%.<p>By tackling a logical fallacy with scientific thinking he opened the window to be completely corrected by it himself. Trees grow because they take the carbon out of the air. However you talk about mass and we're talking about molecular weights.<p>Now if he'd have been as smart of Feynman he would have dismissed the water quite logically again. The rain falls from the sky. Save for a few very large trees that actually reach into the water table, trees well inland rely solely on the rain for their supply of water. That means the 50% of its mass that is water still technically comes from the air from moisture being condensed in cold air and forming water droplets.",1278043907

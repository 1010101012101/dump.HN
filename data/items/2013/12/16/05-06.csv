The reason why our pervasive cultural irony is at once so powerful and so unsatisfying is that an ironist is impossible to pin down. All irony is a variation on a sort of existential poker-face. All U.S. irony is based on an implicit &quot;I don&#x27;t really mean what I say.&quot; So what does irony as a cultural norm mean to say? That it&#x27;s impossible to mean what you say? That maybe it&#x27;s too bad it&#x27;s impossible, but wake up and smell the coffee already? Most likely, I think, today&#x27;s irony ends up saying: &quot;How very banal to ask what I mean.&quot; Anyone with the heretical gall to ask an ironist what he actually stands for ends up looking like a hysteric or a prig. And herein lies the oppressiveness of institutionalized irony, the too-successful rebel: the ability to interdict the question without attending to its content is tyranny. It is the new junta, using the very tool that exposed its enemy to insulate itself.&quot;<p>From David Foster Wallace&#x27;s &quot;E Unibus Pluram&quot;.",1387173580

For example, tracking down bugs or answering e-mail questions from co-workers or customers generally doesn&#x27;t require the amount of creativity that solving a previously unsolved problem does. Neither does figuring out how some open source API works (whoever designed it originally did the heavy lifting for us).<p>So if we reserve the hard stuff for our hours of peak creativity, we could optimize our creative output while still getting a lot of other useful stuff done in the remaining hours of an eight hour day.

That cries for help fall on deaf ears. Then you conclude with the idea that hate was the only thing that kept tribes of humans together and that now we&#x27;re a big happy world.<p>I&#x27;d argue that compassion and tolerance are best practiced in those small groups as well, as you are forced to recognize the person behind the stereotypes (Note: I live in a town of 800 people and can tell you the names of many people who struggle with mental illness, some of whom I&#x27;ve been blessed enough to be able to help at times).<p>So I&#x27;d actually argue the opposite of your point. Sociologically it&#x27;s been demonstrated that humans tend (not always) to operate best and honestly in a certain size group.

The fact that the NSA takes polygraphs seriously (despite presumably knowing there&#x27;s little scientific evidence supporting their use and knowing that lots of spies have had no trouble passing them) makes me think the NSA must be full of gullible morons.<p>Does the NSA weed out polygraph non-believers during their hiring process? So far as I know, the main &quot;valid&quot; use of polygraphs is (a) to trick/intimidate people who believe in them into telling you a more thorough story, (b) to acquire a &quot;scientific&quot; seeming reason to do or believe what you already wanted to do or believe going in.<p>I don&#x27;t feel very reassured.",1387170752

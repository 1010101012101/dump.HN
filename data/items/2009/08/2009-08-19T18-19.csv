Within 50 miles of the city? Do I go to them?<p>We need to do a better job at this but in some cases yes, in some cases no. We'll try and get providers to list better details on the location of service field.<p>Can I cancel a bid? Etc. etc.<p>Hmm, not yet, but we'll develop this policy tonight.<p>Thanks!",1250708383

773464,comment,772603,772734,0,0,dkersten,,,"The Factor community likes to use the following phrase to answer that question and I think its quite correct: ""Idiomatic Factor does not use the stack"".<p>That is, well written idiomatic Factor makes use of higher level abstractions which hide the stack from you. The stack should not be used as a data structure, but rather as a scratchpad to allow pointfree programming. Factor provides a load of abstractions which can often handle all of that low level stack handling stuff for you, making the code easier to read, follow and understand (once you know the abstractions). Factor also provides local variables, for use when it makes sense to name your data. Its not shunned to use them over the stack - when it makes sense to. Finally, Factors macros allow you to modify how the code is parsed (Factor calls them ""parsing words""), so you can actually change the syntax. Core Factor provides an ""infix"" parsing word which allows you to write infix expressions and it is advised to do so when it makes sense (eg, for mathematical formulas). Another example of parsing words put to great use is Jeremy Hughes' inline C/C++ library, which basically allows you to write C/C++ code inline in Factor source files. During compilation, Factor will compile this code with GCC and simplifies writing of FFI stubs for wrapping C/C++ libraries.<p>Basically, Factor is very different from Forth. Slava likes to say that ""Factor has more in common with Lisp than it does with Forth"" and its often said that Factor only has a syntactical resemblance to Forth, but is otherwise very different.",1250708184

Marketmaking is of positive value to society so they get paid for that. The marketmaker is being paid to take some risk and when you hit the offer to buy a share you're paying a little bit to the MM for taking some market risk for you.<p>Any other trading functions can be thought of as picking up alpha that other, less nimble, market participants are leaving on the table.  That's the redistributionist part he's talking about there, but actually this is positive for society also because it increases liquidity also and makes the market more efficient.  I also think that in general it's positive for society for the smartest and best people in a particular endeavour to be well-rewarded, because that gives a strong incentive to other smart people to step into the field.<p>Most of the carping about HFT comes from people who are losing business because they can't compete.

These options are trading on the market at about $4, so if Dr. Evil sits tight and continues on the company's current strategy we can assume his compensation will be $4 billion on average.  If he uses the ""roulette strategy"", on the other hand, his expected return is 23.69 * 18/38 * 1e9 = $11.2 billion.  That's much better, and not as much work.  In a company with a lower implied volatility than Microsoft, the options would be worth less money initially and the roulette strategy would look even better by comparison.<p>Now, the shareholder lawsuits could be a problem.

That's probably just because the user population is low, but when the front page is littered with auctions like 'learn how to bake a cake' or 'make a cornhole toss board' I have to wonder about the usability here. I'm hardly interested in scrolling through a random list of services provided by amateurs.<p>I think a better method would be to put emphasis on the different types of services, and build some competition among the providers in different niches.<p>The site design is pretty decent, but there are some usability issues that could be improved. For instance, the Polaroid panel on the profile pages is not working for me. The persons auctions should be front and center somewhere on the profile - not parenthetically hidden behind the portfolios. Moreover, the large red button floating all alone by itself that says BID...  when you click on it you are shown the auctions, not bidding. Did you not have enough room to make the button say, 'view this user's auctions'? Probably not. Also, when you click bid, the title of the page reads 'Bid on <username>'. Technically I'm not bidding on a user, I'm biding on one of their auctions. All this could be fixed by placing multiple bid buttons after the auction description.<p>All in all, it's got potential, but there are a lot of loose ends.",1250706468

There is so much tuning required to get these algorithms to perform the way you'd expect that I think they could still keep their IP locked up even if they gave a general hint.<p>With that said, I'll speculate as well:
Perhaps you'd need some type of ideal dataset, one that included departure times/arrivals and distances and weather conditions of flights that came in on time as expected.  Then you might start introducing some noisy data, ie. flights that made the same trip but came in late or early with same weather conditions.  Then you'd add in the effect of weather conditions and see how flights fared.  I'd speculate that you could get away with doing some type of regression analysis, but maybe you'd need to resort to a more complex algorithm for classifying (""On-time"", ""Early"", ""Late"") based on a series of features (""Distance"",""Weather"",""Mechanical"", ""Time"", etc).  SVM could pull this off, or perhaps even a naive bayesian classifier.  For research purposes I'd probably check out RVM because it might need less information to classify.

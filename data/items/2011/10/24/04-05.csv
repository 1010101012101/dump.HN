A warm fuzzy feelings index?<p>The problem is ""shareholder value"" is defined using a measure of TODAY's stock price, which is highly volatile and subject to really minor changes in quarterly reports. So companies tend to spend an inordinate amount of resources trying to level out the volatility of their short term stock price by doing whatever they can to meet quarterly expectations, which leads to misallocation of capital.<p>A better measure might be the potential value of a stock some number of years out, which can be roughly measured using stock options trading if the options markets have access to enough data. That type of data would include things like customer satisfaction metrics, R&D spending, etc. (ie the types of things Steve Jobs optimized for).",1319432111

I like Apple products, Steve Jobs is interesting, and I was bummed to hear when he got sick and of course when he died.  But I didn't know him, and he definitely didn't know me. I bought products that his company made, and that's it. I like the products a hell of a lot better than, say, than 10 gallons of gas I just bought from Shell, but still the relationship between me and the company CEO was pretty distant.<p>Back to the video... Many of the Apple people probably didn't know Steve either, but they sure knew more about him and the idea of an Apple family and Steve as the patriarch is pretty clear. I've been in corporate ""families"" before and there can be real emotion between colleagues with shared passion in a company.  I think it's great that they had a celebration like they did, but I felt like I shouldn't be there, even through a web video. I felt somehow like an intruder, spying in on their private event, and that the heartfelt speeches from one Apple employee to the others should have just stayed in their family.<p>I'm not saying it was necessarily bad to post or was in poor taste.

3148332,comment,3146365,3146365,1,0,michaelpinto,,,"If you think about the phrase ""designer"" in its wider sense it's always an occupation that's multidisciplinary by the nature of the gig. It doesn't matter what type of design you are (industrial, graphic, fashion, etc.) because you are always working with people outside of your profession. Many people think of a designer as someone on a mountaintop who is going after ""a vision"" -- well that's real a fine artist.<p>Designers on the other hand are always about making something for an end purpose, and something that NEEDS to please an audience (be a client or end-consumer). Design should be style thrown on top of engineering -- that's decoration, which isn't what designers do. Designer solve problems, tell stories and give their creations personalities.",1319431804

They are different use-cases, and no desktop OS is going to break into the tablet market. He talks of the safe conservatism of Windows but sadly that is headed in the same direction. But no one who uses Metro is going to use it in the way Microsoft has in mind, which is apparently either with their elbows propped up on their desk interacting with a touchscreen monitor, or on a tablet device whose manufacturer installed Windows 8 by mistake instead of iOS or Android or whatever the equivalent for Windows Phone OS will be. Windows is a mouse-and-keyboard desktop environment, as are Unity and Gnome 3, and they will remain so for as long as we have PCs sitting under desks connected to monitors sitting above desks. The use case of desktop computing used to be split between ""I have shit to do"" and ""I'm bored and don't have shit to do"" but the latter is moving quite quickly to tablets.

I can't even count the number of time irregularities in just <i>that</i> one section ended up providing deep insight into a good or bad candidate.<p>Everybody who has an education puts it on their resume even if it's 30 or 40 years old and they jam it at the bottom in a small font.<p>For example:<p>A weird school name - ""International University of America"", ""University of New York City"" often points to a diploma mill or a lack of degree<p>Missing GPA - The rule of thumb is, put it on if it's a 3.5 or higher. Don't put it on if it's lower and let the employer guess or ask during the interview. Or...if it's missing assume it's below a 3.5. It's up to you how much weight that has in the interview. You may be targeting a school or degree major that make it very hard to get a high GPA. If the school does some artsy fartsy ""non-traditional"" grading system and doesn't use GPAs, or they are from a foreign country with a different system, figure out what they do use and ask that during an interview. If the school is an ""every one is a winner just for trying"" school, they probably aren't the candidate you are looking for anyway.<p>""Attended xyz"" or ""Coursework in major abc"" - means they didn't finish school. Somebody currently going will likely have a ""estimated completion Spring of 20xx"" or some such instead.<p>""Environment"" - I see this often from candidates from India, and I don't know why this happens, but they'll list a perfectly good school and education credentials, then list <i>environment</i> and virtually every piece of hardware and software that they happened to have had in the room with them during their studies regardless of their use of it or not. Ignore this since it's obviously coming from some weird resume writing coaching and probably a result of trying to cram a CV into a resume format.<p>No colleges listed only a high school - no problem, if the candidate looks good, they might still be a fantastic hire. Especially if they are young and haven't decided what to do yet. You can always go back to school. You usually see this on resumes of young candidates or experienced candidates with no upper education.<p>There is no excuse to not have an education section on a resume. Experienced people will tend to put it at the bottom and let their work history speak for them, and inexperienced candidates will do the opposite. Resumes without that section should go straight in the shredder, same as resumes with typos, grammar errors, punctuation problems, a constantly changing font (or Comic Sans). It's like not putting your callback #, email address, home address or work history.<p>Also, if you are about to hire somebody based heavily on their education pedigree, you should absolutely use this service <a href=""http://www.nslc.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nslc.org/</a>.

Here in Ireland, the education system is somewhat different to the way it is in the US and many other parts of the world. You pick a course, and then for the next three or four years, you attend only the classes that belong to that course. There's very little choice in the matter (though you can technically attend other classes, but not officially and at the lecturer's discretion).<p>I'm in my third year of a four year computer games development course. I absolutely love the course, the lecturers, and of course my friends at college.<p>I've been thinking about dropping out because I've been finding the course difficult recently and because I've got a skewed vision of myself, of my motivations and my abilities. It's so easy to think ""I'll drop out and then I'll have the time to do this and this and this and this,"" and much harder to think ""If I drop out I'll spend every day on the couch playing videogames and growing less and less as a person.""<p>That's not the way it is for everyone, but it is the way it is for me. If you told me you were thinking about dropping out, I'd ask for the proof that you're not going to waste, because that's such an easy trap to fall into.

That tends to be more of the Erlang Way of doing things ...",1198169269
91524,comment,91405,91405,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Its interesting that at this very moment, we're finishing up connecting contacts between users for collaboration with our startup.  (The trick was to allow users to be able to own their own contact lists and information within a secure zone (for example, a company needs to own a version of an employee's personal contact info even if the person leaves), but then be able to create a link to the people or companies represented.  At any point in the identity graph, information can be deemed private and only available to owners, etc.",1198169258

(Note - it definitely does <i>not</i> work with Safari 2)<p>The initial load time in Safari is significantly longer than firefox (although refresh loads are much more speedy).  You might have to wait 10-20 seconds.",1198169142

91515,comment,91361,91501,0,0,a-priori,,,"I totally agree, but really, I don't see what's so horribly strange about Erlang. Don't get me wrong: it's my favourite language and I'm in the process of founding a startup with Erlang as the core language. I just don't understand the aversion... people seem to treat it like an impenetrable terra incognita.",1198167059

91512,comment,91140,91492,0,0,pchristensen,,,"I generally do the same thing, although I vary x depending on the context.  Certain writers (Graham, Spolsky, Yegge, Raganwald) can write as long as they want and I'll read it.  Their signal to noise is so much higher (both in content and entertaining writing) that I find it better than reading the rest of the stuff on the internet.<p>But yeah, 300-350 is about my limit for books too.  I've passed up books I wanted to read when I found out they were over 500 pages.  I just put them back in the todo list for later.",1198166919

Its amazing how much your child will change and how things that are front and centre in their/your life will fade when day-day life demands attention. Take as many pictures as you can so that you can look back in a couple of years' time and remember those things (and get a good backup plan in place NOW).<p>ii) <i>All children develop at their own pace</i>. Children pick up skills only on a very rough timescale: our eldest could do jigsaws when he was a year old but couldn't jump till he was nearly two. Our friend's daughter could draw recognisable pictures staggeringly early but didn't know where to start with a jigsaw puzzle. Now they're 3.5 and both of them can do all of those things perfectly well. Praise them for trying things not just for being good at them.<p>iii) <i>try not to assume the worst</i>. Its easy - especially with your first child - to get sucked into thinking that your child must have some uniquely awful illness or impediment to a normal life because they 'still' aren't sleeping/they have a cold that hasn't cleared up/they haven't fed well that day etc etc. Whilst these things can happen, and you should obviously watch out for signs of serious problems, chances are nothing sinister is behind it. Accept that this is a phase and that in a few days or weeks it will have passed and you'll get through the rough times much easier.<p>iv) <i>share the sleepless nights</i> the lack of sleep is tough. Try and agree a rota with your partner as to who will be 'point-man/woman' each night and let the other sleep (ideally in a spare room). The key word is agree - do your 'night-shifts' dilligently and don't be tempted to start comparing the difficulty of the shifts you've already done (i.e., a night where the child slept through doesn't mean your partner is on-shift the following night). These things will balance out.",1281628678

For a company heavily involved in software, the CEO needs to understand software in general and the software of his company in particular.<p>In a startup, he needs to be able to understand all the software, in detail, from the 'architecture' down to line by line.  So, for this he needs to have enough knowledge of computing to understand, evaluate, and construct the architecture and have good knowledge of all the crucial 'software tools'.  So, if the software is in C++ and Apache, then the CEO needs to understand these two.  Windows?  He needs to understand some or all of .NET, the CLR, C#, Visual Basic .NET, ADO.NET, ASP.NET, etc.<p>Now we come to a curious point:  For the CEO to acquire that knowledge takes more of his time than writing the code, given the knowledge.  So, really, once the CEO has learned to write the code, he can, for less than the time investment in learning the tools, just go ahead and write the code.  He should.<p>Since the CEO wrote the code, maybe that makes his company a 'hacker culture'?  I hope not:  There are things more important than ASP.NET, etc.  While knowing ASP.NET might be necessary, it is not sufficient.  Just because the CEO drives his car does not make him a chauffeur.  Instead, the software is just part of his job.<p>Next, my experience is that the best software developers and, in particular, the ones best at the most technical details of software, and the best at software 'architecture' are not 'hackers' and are not even 'computer scientists' but are mathematicians who took out a few afternoons to understand, say, AVL trees, extensible hashing, Cartesian trees, minimum spanning trees, DeRemer's LALR parsing, and monotone locking protocols but also understand dynamic programming, linear programming on networks, Lagrangian relaxation and non-linear duality, Poisson and Markov processes, and martingales.  Sorry 'bout that!<p>With that technical knowledge and work, he has to pay close attention to the product, customers, revenue, hiring, etc.<p>Not so strange.",1281626984
1598317,story,,,1,5,NathanKP,"Ask HN: Regular Expression to Remove Script Tags and Their Contents?",,"Hello,<p>I am currently working on a Ruby web parser for reading webpages and extracting the text only.  I am using the following lines of code to strip scripts, styling, and tags:<p><pre><code>    cleaned = html.gsub(/<[^(>|\/)]*?script.*?>[^<]*?<.*?\/script.*?>/, """")
    cleaned = cleaned.gsub(/<[^(>|\/)]*?style.*?>[^<]*?<.*?\/style.*?>/, """")
    cleaned = cleaned.gsub(/<\/?[^>]*>/, """")
</code></pre>
The only problem is that if the script tag contains a less than sign such as:<p><pre><code>    <script type='text/javascript'>
        var foo=3;
        if(foo<5) {
            alert(""bar"")
        }
    </script>
</code></pre>
In that case the first regular expression for removing script tags and their contents does not work.  It all boils down to the part of the regular expression:<p><pre><code>    [^<]*?
</code></pre>
I can't seem to figure out a better way though to make the star grab everything in a lazy fashion (in other words don't match the first opening script tag with the last opening tag in the HTML).<p>Has anyone else worked around this problem in the past?

The ""Self Employment Tax"" (in other words, FICA and Medicare) is closer to 7.5% extra for the self-employed.  When you're an employee you pay 7.5% of this, and your employer matches that.  When you're self employed you pay the entire thing.<p>2. The FICA and medicare tax can be avoided if you're contracting through a third party agency (and being paid W2 via that agency). This has its own set of tradeoffs and rewards, but is another option worth considering.<p>3. Remember that the 401k match has to vest, meaning that 4% match is closer to 1.6% if you hold the job for only two years.  (on the flip side, that 1.6% is pre-tax)<p>The matching can also be a temporary benefit if your smaller company gets bought out by a larger one.<p>4. Paying your own health insurance is a burden, but it's a burden with a fixed monthly cost.

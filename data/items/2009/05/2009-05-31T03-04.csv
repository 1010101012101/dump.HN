Creating a company to contract through certainly creates work and (in Australia at least) there is no tax advantage in doing so - but a lot of the basics of running a company (particularly tax, insurance, accounting and director obligations) are now second nature to me. I've found this a great way to learn.",1243742114

The comment plugin that was available (at the time) stored all comments concatenated together into one file, which meant that if you wanted to take out one spam comment, you had to open that file and snip something out of the middle.  And when I was on blosxom I attracted a <i>lot</i> of spam.  I eventually gave up and moved to textpattern (<a href=""http://textpattern.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://textpattern.com/</a>), which has also occasionally irritated me, but not enough to switch a second time.

If you increase one aspect does it correlate with other efforts increasing? If there is a flaw in the data collection, how do you spot it?<p>What about offline behavior?

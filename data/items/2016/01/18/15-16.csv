If the OOM killer kills you, all visible effects of your program will still be perfectly consistent with the semantics of your program.

Chris Moody proposes to replace the technique of <i>summing</i> paragraph vectors (to word vectors) with sparse &quot;LDA-vectors&quot;; Then he appends categorical variables (features) to these summed word+LDA vectors and estimates a multinomial mixture over the latent word topics. All this is applied to a conditional probability model to predict the final topic assignments (&quot;topic vectors&quot;) for some set of pre-defined groupings of input documents. Finally, he claims the resulting, posterior topic assignments are even good enough to predict (supervised) outcomes. A more non-mathematical explanation: Imagine analyzing books with word2vec, summing LDA results to the word vectors, and adding in a few categorical variables like year or country when/where the book was written. Then use that &quot;super-vector&quot; to assign LDA topic (distributions) to the respective <i>authors</i> of the books. The final claim (which he makes a point of stating that his evidence is weak) is that you could use that &quot;author-specific topic vector&quot; to predict, e.g., how popular each author is.",1453132639

Nor can it afford Netflix&#x27;s asking price for its shows.<p>Basically, is investor money is propping up Netflix and distorting the market, same as in other tech-disrupted markets?<p>edit: I was wrong - Netflix is indeed simply reinvesting almost all its revenue (largely into producing shows), rather than relying on investor money, as petra says. So FX and other networks should consider recalibrating their strategy to focus on higher-quality content production, if the market is rewarding that.",1453132597

10925066,comment,10923934,10924692,0,0,WildUtah,,,"This is relevant because employment discrimination law in the USA prohibits the use of any tests where certain protected racial categories score worse than the national average by a specific amount. Usually that amount is specifically that each protected race must achieve four fifths of the passing scores of any other group. (Yes, that is a vague and easily gamed standard. It was made up by lawyers in the Department of Justice, not by game theorists in the DoJ.)<p>The result in, for example, fire and police departments has been that all the tests, especially written tests, have been dumbed down so that 80% of everyone passes. That is automatically considered to fulfil the four fifths standard. Then candidates are chosen by political patronage or random selection.<p>The result is much worse average qualifications. If there were just a racial quota like US universities use, you could pick the top X% of people from each protected underperforming racial category but also the top people from each of the high performing categories. In the Jewish Problem and four-fifths scenario, you don&#x27;t get the top people from the high performing category except by chance and with four-fifths not from the protected categories either.<p>The new, state of the art federal civil service exam written under the Carter administration was abandoned because protected racial groups did badly. the obvious solution of race norming was considered out of bounds because Republicans could demagogue against the practice. The entire civil service exam system was dismantled instead and race based hiring is promoted with no objective standards. The result is the worst of all possible worlds. It&#x27;s just lucky that federal jobs are still plush enough that good people work hard to game any system to get them.",1453132545

10925027,comment,10923379,10924301,0,0,_yy,,,"> 1. Phabricator is actually a suite of different applications that do specific things (e.g. source code hosting, issue tracking, project management, ...). Although Phabricator ticked all our feature boxes, some of the components it ships with are very immature and/or don&#x27;t get a lot of attention from the development team.<p>The features which aren&#x27;t explicitly marked &quot;experimental&quot; work very, very well in my experience. Especially the code review part, which I find more pleasant to use than Gerrit.<p>> 2. For some reason the platform as a whole feels like a CRUD layer on top of a data model. The UI and various workflows in the applications are very tightly coupled with the underlying data model. I guess that makes it easy to develop and maintain the various core applications of Phabricator, but it doesn&#x27;t make for a very user-friendly or usable product.<p>Have you got some examples? They&#x27;re hiding the database pretty well IMO, and we haven&#x27;t had many usability complaints that weren&#x27;t about minor issues. Many of the experimental features are cumbersome to use though and we&#x27;ve turned off some of them again to avoid confusion.<p>> 3. We have ~150 internal repositories, we actively work on ~40 of them at any given time. The source code application doesn&#x27;t seem intended for that many repositories (e.g. navigating to a specific repository is non-trivial)<p>Have you raised an issue about this? They&#x27;re very responsive to issues encountered in real-world use and usually decide about feature requests by user demand. I do know that they&#x27;re working on improving this - the &quot;callsigns&quot; will become optional, for example.<p>> 4. Phabricator has a fundamentally different approach to &quot;pull requests&quot;. It works really nice, but only if you commit to using the Phabricator Way Of Doing Things. However, our team has been working on Github.com for years, and we&#x27;re so used to the Github-workflow that we couldn&#x27;t get used to the Phabricator workflow.<p>Their way of doing (or actually, not doing) pull requests is the most important feature of Phabricator. Their approach scales much better than the traditional style and is - in my opinion - the most important reason to choose Phabricator over Github-style tools.

There are multiple &quot;versions&quot; (really, generation algorithms) of UUID and GUID, each with their own problems:<p>* Some types of UUID uniquely identify the machine they were generated on (one version contains the MAC address + current time, another contains the POSIX UID/GID + domain name) - this got Microsoft into hot water in the 1990s when Word added GUIDs to documents, which meant you could trace documents Stasi-style<p>* Some types of UUID are based on insecure hashing algorithms (MD5 and SHA1)<p>* Some types of UUID are namespaced, because everything needs namespaces, obviously<p>* There&#x27;s a specially reserved type for Microsoft to use for special COM objects<p>There&#x27;s only one mode you should actually use, which is the random bits.<p>UUIDs and GUIDs also have a weird spacing of dashes. You&#x27;d expect three dashes, splitting it into a sequence of 4-byte chunks, but no: it&#x27;s split into 4-2-2-2-6, for some reason. And which chunk it is matters, because different chunks <i>have different endianness</i>. Some of them are considered numbers, some of them bytes, even though they all look the same. Some of them have special significance (it contains two different version numbers!), with no especially obvious rhyme or reason to their placement. Oh, and the endianness is implementation-defined: GUIDs are partly &quot;native&quot; endian (usually little-endian, then), partly big-endian, whereas UUIDs are <i>typically</i> big-endian. How do you tell them apart? Well, GUIDs are <i>usually</i> written in capitals, and UUIDs are <i>usually</i> written in lowercase.<p>I just use 16 random bytes encoded in hexadecimal, separated by three dashes at 4-byte increments. No hashing algorithms, versions, endianness issues, namespacing, severe privacy problems, just random bytes. It&#x27;s not only simpler, it has more bits of entropy, and is easier to generate.",1453132245

LDA is global, creating document representations that are less flexible but very interpretable to humans. lda2vec mixes both ideas.<p>Ultimately, the goal is to use all of the information that is usually available alongside text. Word2vec treats this text like one long string. LDA has the notion of documents. But lda2vec can use more features (for example) the zip code a client comment might come from (and so you get regional topics, like outer wear in Vermont or cowboy boots in Texas) the client ID a comment comes from (so you get that a client might be a sporty client, or a expecting mother) in addition to document-level topics (which might surface customer comments like &quot;perfect service!&quot; or package delivery problems).

Not by a long shot. It is absolutely speculation, but it&#x27;s reasonable speculation. We probably need a lot more data before we can say anything more specific about this.

This made for a very complicated map. So Westphalia established the idea that a nation could be a superset which included both Catholics <i>and</i> Protestants. This makes for a simpler map -- <i>if</i> one is mapping the boundaries of the newly-established idea of nationhood, and then retroactively mapping that concept onto the past.<p>However imagine drawing a map of the present, but with pre-Westphalian sensibilities. You&#x27;d want to know: where are the Catholics living, and where are the Protestants living? That map has gotten a <i>lot</i> more complicated (even before you try to account for all the Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Pagans, etc.), and at this point the question hardly makes sense outside of certain bits of Ireland.<p>Analogously, force monopolies are primarily of interest (at a national level) where territorial integrity is the primary name of the game. But if economic exchange (both competitive and cooperative) between cities were to become the acknowledged name of the game, then although force monopolies would almost certainly continue to exist, they&#x27;d be of as much interest as (say) the boundaries between different police departments.<p>In other words, I suspect the mapmakers of the future draw on the basis of something other than force-monopoly boundaries. This may look more complicated to our eyes -- but we might also look more complicated to theirs.<p>[edit: grammar]",1453131745

SpaceX lands on land preferably when it is an option.<p>> I don&#x27;t understand why they won&#x27;t keep landing them on the ground ... It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s not enough space on Earth<p>As a general rule, you not understanding the reason for something does not mean there is not a good reason. For reference, see the Dunning-Kruger effect. Furthermore, I honestly do not understand how you could even contemplate &quot;SpaceX does not think there is enough space on land&quot; as a serious argument and treat its dismissal as legitimate support for your beliefs. This is some of the most egregiously lazy reasoning I have ever seen on the internet.<p>SpaceX launches rockets in the direction of water so that an accident won&#x27;t threaten property or people on land. To return to land after staging the first stage of the Falcon 9 must perform a burn—the &quot;boost back&quot;—to point its lateral velocity back to land; this is the first of three burns required for landing and the most expensive in fuel by a considerable margin. If the first stage is travelling too quickly (greater than approximately 1.6 km/s lateral velocity) it does not physically have enough fuel to return to the launch site and perform the landing. In this case, a far more mild burn can put the booster on a re-entry trajectory and it can land on an autonomous barge in the ocean. As the rocket trajectory is chosen to put the ground path well away from land, the choice is between either returning to the launch site or landing in the ocean. If a return to the launch site is prohibited by the rocket&#x27;s capabilites and physics then an ocean landing is the only option.<p>In the case of Jason-3 a barge landing was the only option as SpaceX does not yet have permission to use their landing facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In the future, the central core of the Falcon Heavy will almost certainly have to land in the ocean due to its velocity at separation.",1453130948

It would be the canvas/dinghys AND compressed gas canisters for inflating them.  This is arguably (a lot?) more weight than just landing struts + fins.  Any extra payload on a rocket represents a massive cost and means less stuff you can haul for paying customers.",1453129611

I&#x27;ve also spent a reasonable amount of time on &quot;big water&quot; and was specifically watching the attitude of the landing deck with respect to the horizon.  I didn&#x27;t see much movement of the barge (but that doesn&#x27;t mean there wasn&#x27;t some instantaneous movement that together with the force of landing exceeded the leg&#x27;s load rating).<p>The other thing that&#x27;s struck me is that the SSTO advocates could end up becoming irrelevant.  Who&#x27;s going to argue we need SSTO at all if we can recover and reuse all the stages anyway?

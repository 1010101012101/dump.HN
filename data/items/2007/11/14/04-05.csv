Never before has Microsoft seemed so vulnerable. It is being attacked on all fronts by huge, game-changers. Is this a repeat of computing history? Microsoft changed the scene when they licensed MS-DOS and later Windows to IBM -- which was the dominant force, at the time. In those days, everything had to be IBM-compatible. Microsoft's operating system powered IBM computers -- and, as we know, software can be highly profitable. Thus, Microsoft quickly eclipsed IBM and went on to rule the world with an iron fist. Is this deja vu'?",1195014845

79649,comment,79464,79590,0,0,queensnake,,,"This is kind of moot, truthfully I'd go, now (or look first at, but they're both getting praise so...) for Chris Bishop or Ethem Alpaydin's new books. But between Norvig and Mitchell, Norvig has 138 pages on learning vs Mitchell's ~390, but, Mitchell's is from a different era, Norvig is easier to read - larger pages, more diagrams, better writing, and you know where you are better - and fresher material. To each his own. But like I say, I'd probably go with one of the even newer ones. For a while Mitchell was all there was, then Norvig came along, and now there're a few to choose from. ",1195014145

I won&#x27;t go into too many of them, but quickly:<p>1) Anycast doesn&#x27;t give you fine grain control. Once we announce our anycast routes, what traffic actually gets sent where is out of our control - it is based on the peering arrangements of our transit providers. If we need to balance traffic between our pops, we need finer grained control than a single anycast IP.<p>2) IP addresses get blocked for all sorts of reasons (looking at you China!) If all customers were on one IP address, as soon as China decides to block one customer, they are all blocked.<p>3) Anycast sometimes has weird behavior. For example, traffic might be sent to a datacenter that might be close in terms of peer links, but far in terms of physical distance and latency. Using DNS, we can route around these issues.<p>I am not sure what you mean about the &quot;40gbps fat-server&#x27;s load of traffic&quot; causing issues.

It&#x27;s only if they exceed the # of retry attempts that they&#x27;ve budgeted for that a solution like yours becomes viable, and even then, you&#x27;re not fighting against &quot;the cost of getting things set up&quot;.<p>You&#x27;re fighting against the cost of having their rocket blown up on launch because of bad or unforseen weather events. That&#x27;s why they scrub - not because the weather is too bad to fly - it&#x27;s because there could be an unforseen event happening because an anvil cloud (which has lightning in it) - merges with another large storm formation at 10 nm - basically, it&#x27;s insurance against the rocket blowing up.<p>If you can insure your weather detection solution in the high hundreds of millions for a positive launch, then there would be a market for it.<p>And to be successful, your product will need to cut that 3 min downwards, not upwards.<p>So that mission control can have a better confidence of scrubbing a launch, say within 10-s of launch time vs 3 min.<p>You get what I mean?

Most newbies ask, &quot;Why isn&#x27;t there a simple [click here to get HTTP server] button?&quot;<p>1. You get your server by wget, but you still can&#x27;t install it directly. Your OS wants an executable file, so you Google &quot;How do I create an executable file&quot;. The top 10 tutorials tell you to use some software called Eclipse, but that needs some kind of &quot;JVM&quot;. What you received in the archive was some &quot;.c&quot; crap. You&#x27;re lost, no tutorial is helping with what to do with .c files, in what order to concatenate them, and StackOverflow bans your question. You are not fit to operate a computer.

So, they end up loosing their cars, their jobs and a bunch of other side effects. It&#x27;s all simple microeconomics, allocation of a scarce good goes to the higher bidders.<p>In the short term this mechanism makes prices to self correct. If they rise so much that people cannot afford petrol and there&#x27;s petrol to be sold, the price will have to go down and find another point of equilibrium.<p>The problem is that markets are rarely linear processes, and there are inherent delays between causes and effects.

I have a media background, and I noticed some parallels with what you described at IMVU and what I have seen in my industry.<p>Typically, the projects have involved large media companies building high-quality products/brands, such as television shows or websites. They are designed and built in near-stealth mode with limited opportunities for user testing or audience feedback, and sometimes (but not always) fail miserably when they are released to the world. Conversely, there are examples of media programs/products/brands being developed in a highly iterative/audience-focused approach and sometimes (but not always) leading to a hit or at least becoming self-sustaining.<p>My question is this: Generally speaking, can “lean startup” concepts be applied to media or other industries, or do the unique characteristics of those industries — for instance, high cost structures or dependence on industry-specific business models - make it difficult to really leverage the software-focused product development concepts you outlined?<p>I hope to develop a framework with which to approach product development in my own industry (“lean media”) and would greatly value any feedback/ideas/suggestions for further reading you may have.<p>Thanks!",1428955898

The Colorado is already oversubscribed, and tapping new water sources creates political backlash from locals who don&#x27;t want to see their water going to other counties or states. Finally, pipelines are expensive beasts in a time when the federal government isn&#x27;t interested in eating the costs and state governments can&#x27;t easily wait for counties to pay back out of water sales.<p>Water is a bit odd in that it&#x27;s ridiculously cheap even where it&#x27;s scarce, so the financial incentive to build massive water-diversion projects isn&#x27;t all that great absent a specific political or governmental imperative. It&#x27;s also dubious that it&#x27;s <i>worth</i> diverting water to places that are naturally scarce (or where wasteful policies have drawn down aquifers and other groundwater sources). Pushing the carrying capacity of a region well beyond its natural levels is a fraught enterprise, especially if the regions haven&#x27;t shown themselves to be particularly good at managing their current water stocks.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m betting that in 20 years the Great Lakes rust belt is going to be enjoying a hell of a resurgence.",1428955515

Unfortunately a week later <i>github.com/blab/blab</i> goes through a major rewrite, and breaks <i>blub</i>, but people doing <i>go get blub</i> get the new <i>blab</i>, and their build is broken, so they start complaining to the blub author.<p>Solutions to this:<p>Expect blab never to make a breaking change (somewhat optimistic)<p>Vendor a specific version of blab into blub and update manually<p>Explicitly specify a version of blab to use with a dependency tool<p>Each approach has some drawbacks.",1403931478

Only a little less so due to different namespaces, missing controls, completely different runtime and incompatible desktop modes - maximizing developer happiness since 2011.<p>WinRT really is WPF cleaned up a bit and done with a different language (though it supports .NET bindings easily), and ya, missing a bunch of features that even I sorely miss (though to be share, pixel shaders are kind of dangerous!). Same people, same API architecture, same etc...I still prefer WPF, but because I&#x27;m writing dev environments and not apps.<p>> Not nothing, apparently it&#x27;s enough to declare text-editor devs an extinct species and decree the new generation of devs will skip text editors entirely and only consider IDE-coupled languages.<p>IDEs weren&#x27;t a thing until recently (the last 15 or so years). Text-editor devs aren&#x27;t extinct, just shrinking in numbers. Extinction doesn&#x27;t occur for another 20 or so years. Anyways, you need IDE believers to make good IDEs, you can tell when an IDE has been pushed out by non-believers (it sucks, because they don&#x27;t get it).<p>> Bret Victor showcases the benefits of previewing changes in real-time like the kind you can see with Clojure in LightTable or Swift&#x27;s playground. Late-bound languages are more suitable for effecting real-time changes than static pre-compiled IDE-coupled languages, the kind that was being done in Smalltalk decades ago, even VB6 had better live-editing support than C#/VS.NET does now with Edit/Continue.<p>Why must an IDE-coupled language &quot;static&quot; or &quot;pre-compiled&quot;? I agree C# isn&#x27;t very live nor would I try to make it be live, but the CLR provides a lot of the tools needed to get there (quick real-time tree compilation).

I&#x27;ve taken a C++ course, data structures, discrete math and intro to systems programming. I would love some advice on how to think about how best to plan my MS in CS.<p>The requirements are loose: 12 courses in 1 year, generally no restrictions. I have been thinking of primarily two ways to go about this. The first is to just do a well-rounded CS education, pursuing this article[1]. The second is to spend nearly all the courses in cognitive systems. In this case, when the course schedule doesn&#x27;t provide much in the area, I would propose an independent reading modeled after a course from a stronger school (probably Stanford).<p>If I&#x27;m not interested in pursuing more school after this, does it matter what route I take? Is this actually a useful question to ask? If so, what do I lose/gain by going one way or another?<p>[1] http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/",1403928958

Lots of Objectivists have children and families, including Ayn Rand&#x27;s closest philosophical associate, Leonard Peikoff.<p>- Objectivism does not say that wealth creation is the only goal. It says (summarizing) that self-preservation is the root of all values, and experiencing your values (in myriad ways) produces enjoyment. Wealth creation is just one way to experience your values, not the only way. Another way is, for example, through family.

(to be precise, in the few cases where an internal CA is actually present, the process to have anything signed is usually a bureaucratic nightmare)<p>My particular point of view is a vendor who comes in to deploy stuff on customer servers and is told that Powershell should remain disabled (or be enabled for installation purposes and then disabled again, which removes the possibility of automated maintenance via PS). I guess it&#x27;s a political choice as much as a technical one, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve experienced; and the larger the company, the most likely that this policy is not negotiable.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that PS has been successful; the Windows world was <i>screaming</i> for a half-decent shell and PS is exactly that. I just think that it could have been <i>much</i> more successful had MS chosen their defaults a bit more carefully (and/or implemented a better security model).<p>On the syntax, what I don&#x27;t like is not being object-based -- I don&#x27;t particularly like the &quot;string everywhere&quot; approach -- but rather the over-reliance on special characters (that tends to make a PS script fairly unreadable compared to Python).

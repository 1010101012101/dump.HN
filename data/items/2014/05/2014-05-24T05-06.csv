You can&#x27;t distinguish between the patent troll and the little guy inventor because their rights are one and the same. A patent troll purchases the right to enforce a patent from an inventor who would otherwise not have the resources to enforce it himself. It is that right, the right granted to the inventor, that is being enforced. Without the patent troll the inventor&#x27;s rights would get trampled by the large corporations. Hence, the patent troll is defending the small inventor&#x27;s rights.<p>The fact that the patent troll is not practicing the invention matters not. There is no requirement that a patent holder practice the patent in order to enforce it. I can assure you the big corporations do not practice all patents they hold and enforce, many just get licensed out - and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that. But there also shouldn&#x27;t be anything wrong with the small inventor doing the same thing, except for him it often requires the help of a patent troll. The patent troll is just doing for the inventor what the big corporations do for themselves, thus leveling the playing field.",1400910097

The mind numbing drain of the IT work juxtaposed with the non office lifestyle I had before taking the job and was literally  destroying my soul. I hated it. I now joke that I became an alcoholic in 2 weeks, because I needed to be so blind drunk every night trying to justify how this will be good for my future. And the same as you, the worst part is that my new colleagues liked me and my managers lauded my on how fast I was, delivering great work. I spent the second weekend walking around trying to imagine other jobs, other people, the work culture. Eventually I decided that I could handle the work and push through it, but only if it guaranteed that I could hang out with interesting colleagues and work on interesting problems in the future. I went back my second week and tried to analyse what opportunities I would have given my current role and handed my resignation in after lunch. My boss was shocked, asked if I&#x27;d been poached or wanted to work on something else, but I had made up my mind and couldn&#x27;t wait to try the next thing.<p>If that story doesn&#x27;t bring any comfort because you have to stay, one approach is to be open about how you feel at a team meeting and see if anybody else is willing to timeshare the task.

7792678,comment,7789753,7790669,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"The flaw in your argument is that they can&#x27;t raise the price of that publisher&#x27;s books <i>in a market</i>, they can only raise the price they charge on their own website. When Amazon raises their price for a particular book, that doesn&#x27;t change the price it sells for anywhere else the book is available, and they aren&#x27;t colluding with any of the other retailers to fix prices.<p>What they&#x27;re doing is actually a demonstration of their lack of monopoly power. When they raise the price they charge for a book, any customers doing comparison shopping who want that book in particular will get it from a different retailer. If Amazon had monopoly power you would instead expect substantially all customers to either pay the higher price to Amazon or not buy the book from anyone.<p>The market characteristic that Amazon is taking advantage of is that if they raise the price for books from one publisher, it shifts impulse purchases from that publisher to another for customers looking through Amazon&#x27;s website to find a new book to read. It&#x27;s essentially the same strategy as putting the product of the publisher you don&#x27;t like at the back of the store, or replacing mention of it in your promotional materials with mention of a competing product you also sell. The publisher cares a lot more than Amazon about which publisher&#x27;s books Amazon sells more of, which provides Amazon with negotiating leverage against the publisher. All retailers have that leverage over their suppliers. It doesn&#x27;t require monopoly power. Obviously being bigger gives you more leverage, but being big and having a monopoly are not the same thing.",1400908874

7792660,comment,7791900,7792580,5,0,kibwen,,,"So, normally in Rust, it&#x27;s no problem to ignore the return value of a function. However, some types are tagged with the `#[must_use]` attribute, which makes it a warning at compile time to ignore the return value of any function that returns that type. Take the following program, which writes a buffer of bytes directly to stdout:<p><pre><code>  fn main() {\n      let mut out = std::io::stdout();\n      out.write([0x48, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x21]);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe `.write()` method returns a Result type. The output of compiling this program:<p><pre><code>  $ rustc pxtl.rs\n  pxtl.rs:3:5: 3:53 warning: unused result which must be used, #[warn(unused_must_use)] on by default\n  pxtl.rs:3     out.write([0x48, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x21]);\n                ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n</code></pre>\nAgain, it&#x27;s just a warning, so the program will compile and run as expected:<p><pre><code>  $ ./pxtl\n  Hello!\n</code></pre>\nIf you really don&#x27;t care about the return value here, the simplest (and probably best) way of appeasing this warning is to explicitly ignore the return type by making use of pattern matching:<p><pre><code>  fn main() {\n      let mut out = std::io::stdout();\n      let _ = out.write([0x48, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x21]);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIn Rust, the underscore is a pattern that means &quot;I don&#x27;t care about this thing, completely ignore it&quot;. The advantage of using the underscore here rather than an actual variable, e.g. `let x = out.write(...)`, is that it will be impossible to refer to the return value later on and thus explicitly expresses your intent to ignore it. (Furthermore, if you assigned the return value to a variable and then <i>didn&#x27;t</i> use it later on, Rust would emit yet another warning, this time for having an unused variable.)<p>The warning message alludes to a second way of silencing this error, which is by sticking the `#[allow(unused_must_use)]` attribute on top of your function. This will silence any warnings that arise from that function. If you wanted to disable this warning for your entire program, you could instead stick the `#![allow(unused_must_use)]` global attribute at the top of your program. Alternatively, you could compile the program with the `--allow unused_must_use` flag to completely silence all warnings of this type.<p>(One final note: in all cases where you see word &quot;allow&quot; used above, if you replace it with &quot;deny&quot; it will turn the warning into a compile-time error, thus enabling you to enforce a more rigorous error-handling strategy if you so choose.)",1400908112

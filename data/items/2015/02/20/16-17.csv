9081329,comment,9079415,9080526,0,0,dbbolton,,,"The reason this sort of speech pattern is still mostly intelligible is that consonants are actually more important clues markers to the listener (as a general rule).<p>For example, you could probably interpret &quot;thuh kwuhck bruhn fuhx juhmps uhvr thuh luhzy dug&quot; quite readily, but not &quot;duh dwid drowd dod dudd oded duh dudy dod&quot;.<p>It is true that vowels are sometimes the distinguishing phoneme between minimal pairs, but the reality is that we are quite adept at calibrating ourselves to cope with vowel variation.<p>One example is actually head size, of all things. I won&#x27;t go into all the psychoacoustics involved (not my area of expertise), but your brain adjusts its expectations for how a given vowel should sound based on the speaker&#x27;s unique &quot;instrumental&quot; qualities. In other words, you can end up with two very objectively different waveforms that your brain is able to match up without hesitation.<p>A more familiar example is dialects. A Southern American speaker might say &quot;ice&quot;, and to a General American speaker, it may sound much more like &quot;ass&quot;, but this kind of variation doesn&#x27;t really lead to the hilarious confusion one might expect. After a quick &quot;scan&quot; of another dialect, we usually adapt fairly quickly, and we retain those &quot;settings&quot; for the next time we hear a similar dialect.<p>One example that&#x27;s not so easy to work around might be the pen-pin merger. In general, it leads to few mix-ups. But those speakers, &quot;pen&quot; and &quot;pin&quot; are homophones, and unlike other such pairs (bin-Ben, lint-lent, mint-meant, tin[t]-ten[t], win-when, etc.) they may not be easily differentiable by context. In response, many speakers refer to pens as &quot;ink pens&quot; and pins as &quot;stick pins&quot;, which avoids the ambiguity (animal pens and female swans aren&#x27;t really an issue I suppose).<p>So even when vowels lead to genuine ambiguity, we get around it pretty easily.",1424451588

9081308,comment,9079692,9080284,0,0,daughart,,,"Sorry for the delay - there are many aspects of this that can be patented. Consider all the following inventions:<p>- Alterations of the RNA that guides cutting (natural system uses two RNAs, which researchers fuse and alter for efficiency of the mechanism)<p>- Alterations to the protein for efficiency and specificity (e.g. making it nick instead of cut both strands)<p>- Methods/strategies (how to express the various features, tethering multiple together, how to select only cells that have the changes you want, etc.)<p>- Applications (use of this system to do something novel)<p>However, the largest and most central is the use of the system itself for something that does not occur in nature and is non-obvious. This is a system bacteria use as an immune system against foreign DNA. That is not at all related to genome editing. So if people have a problem (&quot;How do we engineer the genome of this cell?&quot;), and then they come up with a novel strategy (&quot;Let&#x27;s combine these pieces together, using Cas9/CRISPR to cut, then introduce another piece of DNA in a certain way to serve as a template that hijacks the endogenous DNA repair mechanisms to introduce engineered changes.&quot;), that is pretty clearly a process of invention to me.<p>You can&#x27;t just patent something existing in nature, and as you can see from the examples above that&#x27;s not at all what is happening here.

See previous item for why this is a big deal in the US)<p>- Health insurance usually good (Only matters because our healthcare system is so broken, see previous two items)<p>- Decent to good retirement, assuming politicians don&#x27;t find a way to raid it.<p>- Consistent job market—most cities have about the same teacher/population ratio. <i>i.e.</i> you don&#x27;t have to move to a certain place to find a job.<p>- You get to help kids learn (sort of, see last item below)<p>A lot of the appeal comes down to gaining European-like worker protections and services (effectively, though from the employer in this case), which is sort of funny.

Not that that should discourage anyone from promoting those things.<p>The down side:<p>- Little respect/demonized by politicians. Relatedly, many benefits above under constant threat.<p>- Worse pay than a talented person, especially in STEM, could make elsewhere.<p>- Constant stupid pointless methodology churn that approaches the level experienced in programming, but to less purpose and possibly generating even greater stress.<p>- Maybe 75% of your work is basically secretarial, and a fair bit of that isn&#x27;t directly helpful in the classroom (much of it&#x27;s not helpful at all, to anyone—yay bureaucracy!) which can be discouraging if you went in to the profession because you wanted to teach.<p>Source: watched my wife go through an elementary ed. major and several years in the classroom, friends with lots of teachers.",1424451359

It tells you that it was a negative sentence but that you have a high chance that there was a positive word in there that you missed, which is what you need to implement to get neutral sentiment for large neutral documents.",1424450482

I don&#x27;t want to diss the countless teachers who choose that route out of genuine passion and love for education and knowledge, but we don&#x27;t do a whole lot to filter for these people.<p>And it&#x27;s an incredible shame, because my brief two year teaching career convinced me that it&#x27;s one of the most demanding career paths a person could choose. I&#x27;m a lead engineer today and was once a startup founder, and neither job comes close to the stress, the emotional demands, the direspect, the time demands, the politics, the motivational skills, and the relationship building teaching required of me.<p>We act like it&#x27;s such a big mystery why we have such problems in education. To me it&#x27;s pretty simple:<p>1. It&#x27;s an extremely demanding job that&#x27;s only becoming more demanding with the constant shifting of accountability (i.e. blame) onto the teachers.<p>2. Teacher prep is largely horrible. Many ed schools will take anyone with a heartbeat, and highly selective alternative prep programs like Teach For America (of which I am an alum) give people minimal training in comparison.<p>3. Segregation, poverty, and policy create a situation where the students in the greatest need are the worst-served. This is what really kills our system, because students of privilege often have enough advantages to make out okay even in spite of the first two issues.<p>No amount of draconian accountability standards, school privatization, or winner-take-all compensation schemes are going to fix these things.<p>There is some hope though, if we&#x27;re willing to reach for it. We have a lot of human capital in our education system, but I think we&#x27;re applying it poorly. Instead of feebly demanding that everyone suddenly become an 10x teacher, we should find better ways to utilize the competent (if not universally brilliant) people we do have.

Richard Dawkins’ <i>The Blind Watchmaker</i> contains a coherent and convincing argument why Lamarckism is actually <i>wrong</i> as an evolutionary explanation (in a nutshell, Lamarckism fundamentally cannot explain increase in complexity, as Darwinian evolution can, and it additionally doesn’t explain <i>how</i> adaptations of complex traits could possibly be acquired from scratch) – and this is a fundamental, epistemological objection which no amount of evidence could overturn. But few people refer to this reasoning when claiming that Lamarckism is “wrong”.",1424449558

Which is why you get a bunch of annoyed people who care deeply about ABI compatibility, when asked to switch to semver, saying, &quot;Do you really want me to release version 172.0.0?&quot; If the rule is, bump major versions when the project maintainers think it matters, bump minor versions when they think it matters less, bump patch versions when they&#x27;re pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t matter, that&#x27;s exactly what gets derided as &quot;Sentimental Versioning&quot; (<a href=""http://sentimentalversioning.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sentimentalversioning.org/</a>), just dressed up as semver, which is more harmful.<p>If you&#x27;ve got to pay attention to every release&#x27;s changelog and run regression tests anyway, just in case the package maintainers disagree about what&#x27;s important enough for a major version bump, then you have version lock problems anyway.

She was sitting at a table with three elementary school teachers. They were talking about how to gauge student progress when the students had taken a 100-question test, and a 50-question test. None of the three teachers realized that you had to scale the test scores before making a comparison between the two tests. These teachers thought you could just look at the number of questions the students got correct, and see if the students &quot;score&quot; went up.<p>My colleague pointed out that the questions on the 50-point test had twice as much weight as the questions on the 100-point test. One of the three other teachers realized their mistake - the other two just chuckled and said it didn&#x27;t matter.<p>This isn&#x27;t just frighteningly ignorant, it ends up having a devastating impact on many young people. One anecdote: I knew a bright young student who loved learning, but hated school. Why? He took algebra and french in 8th grade; he passed algebra and failed french. When he got to 9th grade he was placed in algebra again, and french 2. The school would not budge from its original placement; I don&#x27;t know the rationale. He failed algebra because he refused to do any homework, and failed french because he couldn&#x27;t make any sense of the class.

Most obviously, at the stages when land animals like reptiles and, later, mammals returned to the water, the size graph lurched upward.<p>&quot;It was the return of mammals, after all, that eventually produced the modern giants of the sea: whales.<p>&quot;&#x27;You can see in the data, there is this trend to increasing size - but a real kick comes when you have these air-breathers re-entering the water,&#x27; Dr Berenbrink told the BBC.<p>&quot;&#x27;Then you have a sort of a step change in size.&#x27;<p>&quot;Breathing air delivers extra oxygen to an animal&#x27;s tissues, he explained, allowing them to sustain bigger bodies beneath the waves.&quot;<p>Oxygen-delivery systems indeed have to be crucial for animal life on land or in the sea. Fish and their gills simply can&#x27;t bring in as much oxygen for an energetic large-mass lifestyle as whales and their lungs can. It would be interesting to find out how much whale blood deoxygenates as it flows through the tissues of the largest whales. The duration of movement on one breath for whales is already quite impressive compared to what most land mammals can achieve, so whales probably have some good adaptations for efficient use of oxygen from each breath.",1424448482

Evolution of the moment often favors animals that aren&#x27;t as easy prey for humans.<p>Somewhere else I read, I think a comment in AskScience about how insects used to be gigantic, an evolutionary biologist noted that over time species evolve to become larger.  I would infer that given a set of ecological constraints, bigger is usually better for intraspecies competition (having already settled upon a successful niche for the species in general).  But then things change, the species itself must compete anew as the ecology changes, and there can be resets, reverting back to smaller more efficient forms.<p>Another thing alluded to in the article is that there&#x27;s some complexity to simply maintaining larger forms.  E.g., breathing air is more efficient if you have to bring in large amounts of oxygen.  The crustacean line simply hasn&#x27;t explored these areas.  So even if there were always advantages to larger forms, not everything can just get bigger.  But it always leaves the question, what about dinosaurs?  So odd that the only true remnant seems to be birds that went down such a different path.",1424448474

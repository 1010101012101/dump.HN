They best business people tend to teach as they go... but the worst like to lecture as they go. So talkativeness is not always a good sign.<p>Greed in a business person is not fatal, but needs to be watched. Hunger is a better motivator than greed because it's self-limiting.<p>Business school is not always a good indicator -- I've met both idiots and geniuses who went to Sloan, LSE, EDHEC, etc.<p>Self-taught or self-made business folk tend to have smaller horizons. You find them a lot in businesses that are less risky, more limited, yet profitable -- eg contract software for government.<p>Scions of old successful (eg 4 generations) families can be very good as long as they are not too emotionally scarred. If they have something to prove, let them do it somewhere else.<p>People who have entrepreneurs (parents, aunts, etc) in the family tend to have more natural and secure approach to business overall. They've seen it done from birth.<p>One good negative indicator is being too ""fancy"". If a person seems to create complex deals just for the joy of it, run away. You want elegant power in business deals just as you want it in programming. Being too fancy is a sign of inexperience, but may also be a sign of greed or worse.<p>Another negative indicator: I've never seen a VC make an outstanding CEO.",1237056657
516068,comment,515749,516023,0,0,bokonist,,,"<i>newspapers had grown complacent and corpulent and were content to rest on their laurels, </i><p>There never was a golden age of journalism.  Before the FTC and the Fairness Doctrine, yellow journalism used to routinely whip people into frenzied states of war mongering.  During the Fairness Doctrine era reporting was bland and extremely biased towards the status quo.  The journalism of today mostly alternates between summarized press releases and tabloid smears.<p>Further note that much of the raw material of news reporting is now online: press releases, CSPAN videos, documents, reports, economic statistics.  When everything is online, there is much less reason to attend meetings and sift through files (not that pint journalists used to do that anyway).  Your arm chair online journalists can report on these just as well, if not better, than your on the ground news paper journalist.  For example, the site <i>Read the Stimulus</i> ( <a href=""http://readthestimulus.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readthestimulus.org/</a> ) has done the best work on what is actually contained in the stimulus package.  A blog Verum Serum did a better job investigating the Obama - Bill Ayers connection than any newspaper ( see this post <a href=""http://www.verumserum.com/?p=2907"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.verumserum.com/?p=2907</a> ).  The best economic writing comes from Brad Setser who routinely analyses the data from its original sources.<p>Even Naked Capitalism, which routinely references newspapers, usually only does so to quote a bank executive or a government official.  Naked Capitalism almost never relies on ""investigations"" done by print journalists.  Without newspapers, those officials could just post their quote directly to a blog, without having to go through a newspaper.<p>Most newspaper journalism has always sucked.  Most online journalism sucks. It takes time and patience to build a set of sources you can trust.  In my opinion, the rise of the internet has both increased the level of noise and crappy sources, but also increased the number of truly worthwhile sources.  I now find, that in almost every subject, the best source of information is an online news source.  Can you name one subject on which the best print news source is better than the best online source?",1237056617

516064,comment,516032,516032,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"A friend of mine is working on a startup, and she's non-technical (not retardedly non-technical...she used Linux on the desktop for many years, and has designed and built a number of very nice looking websites, but she's not a developer or an engineer by any stretch), so she'll be looking for an engineer.  She asked me what she should be doing to insure she is able to attract a good technical co-founder.<p>Here's what I told her engineers look for:<p>Proof that they get shit done.  This is the first thing you'd look for in an engineer for starting a company, and it's likewise the same thing you need in a business guy.  The definition of what shit needs to get done is very different, but it's still the most important thing.  So, what projects have they headed up and gotten done?  ""Business guys"" need to wield the phone, email, project budget, underlings, teammates, etc. in order to make things happen.  If they have excuses for why their team or their prior workplace was crappy and held them back, or whatever, 
they might not have the right attitude.<p>Be willing to do the stuff that hackers hate.  This usually includes business development, accounting, taxes, legal, etc.  A lot of talking to people and choosing vendors and service providers, and figuring out ways to get everything cheaply but in a timely manner.<p>Decisiveness is probably important in a business guy.  Not recklessness...just the ability to make decisions in a reasonable time.  They need to be a good and quick judge of character, since they'll be making most of the deals...and a bad partner early on can spell the end of your startup.<p>Likewise, they need to be honest and have character, themselves.  There <i>are</i> business guys who get ahead by screwing others, but you probably don't want to work with them (because they'll screw you, too), and unless they're <i>really</i> good at it, in the end it will backfire.  The tech industry is, perhaps surprisingly, polite.  Competitors are friendly with each other, and very rarely bite each other in anything other than honest ways...because a competitor one day is a partner the next, and the more you grow and expand your offerings, the more this will happen.  For startups, a competitor one day may be an acquirer tomorrow, as well.  So, don't work with people whose primary competitive philosophy is ""screw everybody else"".  Competing aggressively is obviously mandatory.  But, if they'll say anything to make a sale, it's not good for the long term life and growth of your business.<p>Bring money or the connections to get money.  This is crass, of course, and there are lots of other useful things a business guy can bring to the table, but bringing money to the table is an indicator of almost everything else you're looking for in a business guy (either that, or dumb luck).  It's probably not possible to have good money from a good investor on the table without a prototype...but if they can arrange a meeting with an angel two weeks later to show off your early stage prototype and get the wheels turning on raising a round, you might have a winner.<p>Be easy to work with, and willing to learn.  In the first few months, there's not much to do besides ""make something people want"", so they need to be able to be a contributing partner on that task.  Design, maybe.  Docs, maybe.  Getting feedback from potential customers, definitely.  Figuring out the data you need to build the right things for the right customers.  This one is brute force Googling and making phone calls.  Finding out the size of the opportunity (and whether other opportunities could be addressed with the same technology), making an honest assessment of the competition and figuring out their weaknesses, etc.",1237055891

Yammer has too many of email's features. They need to leave more things out. Otherwise the pathological behaviors that characterize corporate email (poor composition, unclear expectations, inbox overload, endless chains of quotations, complex workflows, reliance on cut-and-paste versus publish-and-link, the use of Microsoft Office attachments) will just port right over, and nothing will change.<p>I'm guessing that removing the character limit will prove to be an especially foolish design decision: Who wants to read five-paragraph Tweets?

I've also done interviews where I've asked candidates why they became interested in programming and they replied, ""I don't really like computers, I just do this for the money.""  One guy actually said exactly that.<p>When 95% of the people you see coming through the door are like this I could see a non-programmer not being in a position to figure out that these people simply aren't worth hiring.... the solution I don't see addressed is more rapid and iterative trial and error in the development hiring process: bringing people on in a limited capacity or throwing them at smaller and contained technical projects before giving them responsibility for more important stuff. I'm a big fan of finding good people for part-time work and then growing them into full time positions if the business model starts supporting it and they want more work.

It's just as hard for hackers to find good businesspeople as it is for businesspeople to find good hackers.<p>Yes, many businesspeople hire bad hackers resulting in a bad product. But equally many hackers hire bad bussinesspeople and never get their product out the door. None of these scenarios are good.<p>The keypoint here is that to start a successful business you need many components, and if you fail at just one of them you're finished - A startup is never stronger than its weakest link.<p>The startups that achieve success acknowledge what their strengths are, are keenly aware of their weaknesses and try diligently to hire people that can fill these out. So the great hacker should not frown at businesspeople if he wants to do a succesful startup, he should acknowledge the fact that he has shortcomings, as everybody does, and try to hire people to fill out these shortcomings. The weakest point with many hackers (in my personal experience) is that they don't like political games, don't like cold-calling people, and don't think marketing should drive your sales.

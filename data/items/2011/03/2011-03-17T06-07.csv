OO has become the common means by which we achieve encapsulation and polymorphism, but these features can be accomplished by other means which have a different (and to some, better) feel.<p>When we say ""Everything is <i>an object</i>"", the core sentiment is that ""Variables behave similarly"". It's jarring to use object.toString() sometimes and """" + 1 others. To (approximately) fix this in an ""code belongs to objects"" universe, you must make everything an object (and have lots of inherited interfaces). In a functional universe you can achieve a more satisfying fix by having multiple implementations of the same method. (str object) and (str 1) behave similarly without imposing interface requirements on the different types. To have large scale projects, this requires that the <i>str</i> function be implemented in different places and dispatch correctly, which is a sophisticated language feature that isn't available in all functional languages.<p>I have long been a fan of python and The Good Parts of JavaScript. They have their problems, but they have served me well thus far. But OO is actually fundamentally flawed, and you only need to look as far as the Java library situation to see how exponentially complex strongly typed and independently developed OO can get.

I never meant to imply that Shinto-Buddhists and Agnostic Christians were exactly alike. I'm sorry if you took it that way. I was hinting towards that fact that they might not participate actively in the religion as much as older folks do (and generations past might have), while at the same time self-identifying with the religion. Much in the way many Agnostic Christians identify as Christian, but don't belong to any church or attend any regular services.<p>Personally I don't see how being an Agnostic Christian has anything to do with youth groups, church football games, etc. Are you claiming that all (or even most) Agnostic Christians participate actively in a church community?

<i>Now</i> maybe, but it's my understanding that in the past the temple at which your family was formally registered meant something more than what you are implying. (Though this was really imposed by the government of the time)<p>I'll admit that my viewpoints may be skewed because Jodo Shinshu 'temples' in the US and Canada were modeled after Christian churches because the Japanese immigrants were trying to fit in, and going to a more traditional temple would have just been another way that they were different. On the other hand, I've met 'ministers' that grew up (and studied) in Japan, and they didn't really say that things were so much different here. So I don't know.",1300342580

Absolute taxes paid? Taxes paid as fraction of total wealth?), so the chart is basically meaningless besides as a sensationalist tool to advance the author's political stance.<p>Another problem is that naturally one would perceive time as the independent axis (usually horizontal/X) while the various tax burdens are a function of that time.<p>I don't mean to diminish the author's point or disagree with  his belief, but this chart does little service for the author.",1300342492

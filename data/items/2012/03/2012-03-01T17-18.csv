At Causes, use your programming powers to help nonprofits effect change on the world! Ruby on Rails + jQuery stack, 10-ish person engineering team, the usual startup perks (catering, snacks, soda, etc), gym membership reimbursement, etc.<p>Ways we're trying to make ourselves better engineers:<p>- deliberate practice with our tools. If you are a vim user, we have the programmer who wrote Command-T on staff and he's a great person to learn from<p>- every changeset gets pushed to Gerrit where it waits to get a +1 from our build suite (that runs in 3 minutes) and a +1 from a human reviewer<p>- actively upgrading our version of Rails, and not stopping until we hit bleeding edge. We hit Rails 2.3.14 last week and hope to hit 3.0.11 within the month<p>- everyone is encouraged to take one hour from their day to learn about something they wouldn't otherwise<p>- every story is scoped so that it can be completed in less than a day. We don't branch, we just work on top of master. We've found that the closer we stay to master, the less needless work we create for ourselves<p>Causes is a great place to better yourself and better the world.

3653186,comment,3652470,3652949,8,0,randomwalker,,,"That's a great question with no simple answer. I've written two essays about this that look at it from two different sides:<p><a href=""http://33bits.org/2011/10/18/printer-dotspervasive-tracking-and-the-transparent-society/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://33bits.org/2011/10/18/printer-dotspervasive-tracking-...</a><p><a href=""http://33bits.org/2011/06/08/the-many-ways-in-which-the-internet-has-given-us-more-privacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://33bits.org/2011/06/08/the-many-ways-in-which-the-inte...</a><p>The synopses of the two posts are:<p><i>My opinion is that it impossible to put the genie back into the bottle  the cost of tracking every person, object and activity will continue to drop exponentially. ... If we accept that we cannot stop the invention and use of tracking technologies, what are our choices? Our best hope, I believe, is a world in which the ability to conduct tracking and surveillance is symmetrically distributed, a society in which ordinary citizens can and do turn the spotlight on those in power, keeping that power in check. On the other hand, a world in which only the government, large corporations and the rich are able to utilize these technologies, but themselves hide under a veil of secrecy, would be a true dystopia.</i><p>and from the other side:<p><i>There are many, many things that digital technology allows us to do more privately today than we ever could.</i><p><i>[examples snipped, but I recommend taking a look at the post]</i><p><i>Of course, Ive only presented one half of the story. The other half, that technology is also allowing us to expose ourselves in ways never before, has been told so many times by so many people, and so loudly, that it is drowning out meaningful conversation about privacy.</i><p>Although these two opinions might at first sight seem contradictory, they are not. Some day I will get around to putting the two sides of the argument together into a coherent narrative that explains the nuanced scenario that I think we're heading towards, but for now I will offer you the above articles.",1330624785
3653185,comment,3651159,3651861,9,0,dxbydt,,,"In graduate school, I was taught RDBMS & ACID by a Math Professor with a Math PhD, who later got a CS PhD, & personally interacted with Date & Codd. My key takeaways from that experience were:<p>1. There's a very stringent one-to-one mapping between RDBMS & relational logic. To put it another way, BCNF is not a matter of taste. Its a matter of adhering to the rules. If two dozen data architects are given the same many to many relation, and asked to take it through 1NF to 2NF to 3NF to BCNF and then stop, every single one of them will have the exact same answer. And this is because normalization is an extremely formal process => formal in the mathematical sense of the word. Two sets that have a given many-many relation will decompose to the exact same subsets because the mathematics of BCNF is unambiguous. This is incredibly powerful => Because there's a wrong answer! So if you hire a data architect & the guy gives you a BCNF & you crosscheck that BCNF with a more reliable architect, you are checking if the answers agree objectively. Its just straight math, not a matter of subjective taste as to which should be the primary key & which should be the foreign key & how the transtive dependence works out.  
2. With objects in the mix, the relationship is already on creaky foundation. ORMs have an impedance mismatch because the relationships captured by notions of inheritance, polymorphisms, mixin traits - these don't have an exact mapping onto the set-theoretic notions captured by BCNF. Morover, there is a matter of subjective taste. You might design your UML differently from me & you might have valid reasons to do so. So while your BCNF exactly matches mine , your object model won't.
3. With kv stores, your relations are even more mathematically fuzzy. You are storing entire multi-valued objects and your rows have variable number of columns & at times you are dealing with completely denormalized structure. The math simply doesn't apply at these levels, and people tasked with populating a NOSQL structure will come up with wildly differing solutions that are completely unsound from a mathematical standpoint, but will nevertheless perform ( upto a certain threshold ) simply because machines have gotten faster & network latency issues aren't holding them back.<p>I see more & more firms pick #3 because of trends( latest & greatest), lack of expertise to do #1 properly, or because of some false sense that scalability will bite them in the ass if they do #1 instead of #3, but primarily because #3 is EASY and #1 is hard. Its nice to not worry about normal forms & just have a multi-column row which grows & shrinks...but is it sound ? Am not sure.",1330624784

On the desktop side, that OS UI is bolted onto the underpinnings of Windows 7.  It would be as if Apple forced Mac OS users to interact with the all their Max OS apps through the iOS UI primarily.<p>Additionally, 'metro apps' as they are known are basically tablet apps.  Windows 8 on tablets is Windows 8 in name only and this seems purposely designed to confuse people into thinking it is more functional than it actually is. No existing Windows desktop apps will work on it at all.  If you buy a Windows 8 tablet, none of your Windows software will work on it.  Your existing copy of Microsoft Office, Photoshop, etc, none of it will work on Windows 8 tablets.<p>On the desktop, using the metro interface and metro apps is incredibly clunky, because you are using things designed for touch with a keyboard and mouse.  It takes longer to get at things and switching between running apps isn't anywhere nears as convenient.<p>In the end, Windows 8 doesn't know what the hell it is yet.

We don't do monitoring. Instead, we plug into all of the existing monitoring systems and handle the people part of the equation: alerting (via phone, SMS, email), on-call scheduling for teams, auto-escalation of critical alerts, and incident tracking.<p>Our current product helps IT ops people know about critical problems as quickly as possible, collaborate as a team to fix problems quickly, and help track and improve incident response performance over time. Our vision is to expand into the event management space. This means treating data from monitoring tools as events and intelligently filtering and correlating events across monitoring tools in order to reduce the noise. It's like spam filtering for events: a critical problem, such as a bad deploy, will automatically alert the entire team via phone call, while a minor issue like a server going down in a fleet of 20 will only generate a low-priority email alert.<p>Why you should work with us:<p>We are different than many startups out there: we charge money for a product. Companies love our product; that's a lot to say for a system that frequently wakes our users up in the middle of the night. Our revenue is growing steadily at more than 10% month-over-month since we launched in Jan 2010. Our customers include: Netflix, National Instruments, VMWare, NBC Universal, Square, Heroku, and 37signals. We're also fairly early stage (11 people, pre-series A). This combination means you'll get a market-rate salary plus a decent chunk of stock in a company that has already figured out its business model.<p>We have very interesting technical challenges. Our biggest challenge is engineering a system that never ever goes down. Since our customers rely on us to deliver their critical alerts, we are not allowed to go down ever. This means we've had to engineer a distributed system across multiple data centers that can survive a single data-center outage without skipping a beat. We're not done: we have a lot more work to do to ensure our system reaches the level of telephony reliability (five-nines). If you like engineering distributed fault-tolerant systems, join us.<p>To apply, please send your resume to jobs@pagerduty.com.",1330624563

There are constant expressions (and values) in Dart, though.

We did a NUANS report (Company name and trade-mark search reports from Industry Canada) and it returned a blank report meaning there was nothing remotely close to it in Canada.<p>Last week we released our first game for the iPad titled ""Animal Scratch for Kids"" in the Apple App Store.<p>Two days ago we received a Cease and Desist letter from a US game studio that our company name is infringing on their US registered trademark (for International Class 9) of ""Picket Fences"" for goods or services in the computer games industry. They have proceeded to contact Apple that our company infringes upon their registered trademark.<p>The case they make is that their ""Picket Fences"" trademark is very similar to our ""Picket Fence"" company name and that the word GAMES in our company's name and website must be disclaimed from a trademark perspective because it's the generic term for our companys underlying products.<p>We never intentionally meant to dilute the brand name of one of their games by naming our company as such nor did we know that we were infringing on a trademark. I know that in legal terms the above statement means nothing but I just wanted to say this wasn't done on purpose in order for us to benefit from their success in any way.<p>Our money as a small startup can be spent in better ways than dealing with the legalities of this issue so my questions to you guys are:<p>Do we realistically stand a chance of wining this case against this company? DO we even have a case? How do we make sure this doesn't happen again?<p>If this is the case for any trademark in the world and we are dealing with an App Store that sells to the entire world this would mean that any person in the entire world with a trademark could potentially shut down any company. How can we protect ourselves in such a case? Is there a world trademark search, and is it feasible to run?<p>Any help, advice or comments are appreciated. I left corporate Canada as a developer to do something fun and creative and get away from all the red-tape and legal crap and this just brings me right back...<p>Thanks,<p>Nik",1330623459

I'd like to hear what your thoughts are on where, we as a society are heading in this context and whether it's unrealistic to expect that conventional expectations of privacy will continue to be fulfilled in the future. Perhaps, we should accept that the privacy battle is lost and try to other solutions to the problems that privacy was solving?",1330621755

374433,comment,374390,374390,0,0,etal,,,"Out of the three leading free DSCMs -- Git, Mercurial, Bazaar -- none seem in danger of going extinct any time soon. Bazaar is the foundation for Launchpad and Ubuntu, almost irrevocably. Mercurial has less buzz than Git for open-source projects, but I suspect it's even more popular in the business world, and its Windows support is solid. Mozilla uses it, anyway. So you might want to give the other distributed systems, particularly Mercurial, another look.",1227498551

374429,comment,374390,374417,0,0,gecko,,,"I'll third the recommendation for Mercurial.  There is no question that git has more community momentum--something which I hope will begin to change--but Mercurial is nevertheless an outstanding distributed version control system.<p>Mercurial's default mode of operation has the benefit of being extremely Subversion-like--in a good way.  Indeed, if you never interact with anyone else, most of the normal Subversion commands--ci, mv, rm, add, log--""just work.""  There is no git-style index to worry about, no rebasing, and the command set is small and regular.  That means that the learning curve is far, far shallower than git.  Yet it still provides the same distributed branching and merging as git, and, though it <i>is</i> slightly slower, the difference is truly negligible in my experience--maybe a couple percent difference at most.<p>What about the incredible power of git, though?  What if you actually want to be rebasing and rewriting your history all the time?  When you <i>want</i> unfettered power in Mercurial, you've still got it.  The `mq` extension, which can be enabled by adding a single line to your configuration file, allows you to do all the crazy patch rewriting, merging, splitting, and rebasing that git does.[1]  But you can ignore that functionality if you want, and still have a very powerful and fast distributed change system.<p>When Fog Creek looked at going to a distributed source control system last year, I advocated Mercurial over the competitors.  Though the transition wasn't seamless, I've been extremely happy with the result.  The Unix experience is extremely pleasant, and TortoiseHg (<a href=""http://tortoisehg.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tortoisehg.sourceforge.net/</a>) provides a surprisingly solid Windows experience out-of-the-box.<p>If you can look past the fanboyism, I'd strongly encourage you to give Mercurial a try.  I think it strikes a much better power-vs.-usability balance than git does.<p>[1] Except microbranching.  Mercurial doesn't currently support local named branches.  You can achieve similar things by using mq with qguards, if you really need them, but in practice, I find it's usually easier to just clone a second repository.  In practice, although I do miss microbranches sometimes, I've found I greatly prefer the streamlined workflow of Mercurial.",1227498463

374427,comment,373675,373734,0,0,light3,,,"I agree - Gladwell has the facts right, but his theories on the reason for the facts are quite off from reality, imo.<p>Even if it is hard to count numbers in english, it is still easy to see the pattern in numerical symbols. Either way it is certainly not a momentous task for a 4 year old to form relations words to numerical symbols, with their abundance of ability in memory. This is why Gladwell's theory falls apart - a much more likely theory is that math ability is more readily determined by HARD work or innate genius.<p>And concerning his rice farming theory, I wouldn't know whether to laugh or take it as an insult, because to me it is that ridiculous. His claiming effectively, that farmers in China work the hardest, because they farmed rice. On how many levels does this seem inconsistent?",1227498264

374423,comment,374027,374027,0,0,etal,,,"For writing school assignments, I looked for a system that would meet two requirements:<p>1. The text can be edited using vim, or at least vi-like keybindings.<p>2. The storage format is plain text, so any version-control system can efficiently store, diff and merge it.<p>OpenOffice can work on top of a single XML file, but XML diffing is not like diffing lines of code, and every accidental ^W is still interpreted as ""close document"". HTML kind of works, but lacks too many typesetting and document-creation features and fixing it with CSS becomes tedious. I played with Texmacs and Lyx for a little while, but eventually bit the bullet and learned LaTeX and vim-latex.<p>Verdict: If you were willing to invest your time in emacs or vim, learning LaTeX feel similar but easier; spending a little extra time to learn a helper package like vim-latex or AUCTeX really makes it worthwhile.",1227497729

They'll judge you based on their preconceptions, their life experience, and a number of other factors that are quite likely more unsound than an external instrument.<p>People are going to judge you anyway, buddy. Just hope the guy calling the shots isn't an arsehole and has your best interests in mind. Which leads me to believe that your problem isn't with the MBTI itself but the human tendency to judge one another on any basis of criteria. That's life.<p>Those looking to apply MBTI for any particular reason to any particular person (including themselves) isn't any worse or wrong or ill-meaning than the next fellow.

In my experience large is quite over >100MB, though.<p>I'd love to convince everyone to switch to git, but I want to note that SVN's branching/merging capabilities are at par with p4's, since at least 1.4 using svnmerge and probably in 1.5 standalone. (My current employer uses p4, and I switched my last workplace over to SVN from CVS.)<p>It does suck to go back to centralized SCM after using a DVCS though (I clone my work p4 checkout into git for minute-to-minute use).

374413,comment,373820,374253,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"Because you no longer have to think much before committing.  You don't have to spend hours reviewing the code and having others look over the patch before you push it to the main tree: you can just commit it locally and go work on something else.<p>Then, later, you might get an idea on how to improve your previous change.  You go and amend it.  And so forth.  Eventually, you have a set of changes that's ready to be committed and which you have <i>used locally for long enough that you can tell it doesn't break anything obvious</i>.  Then, you go through the code review, and finally push the changes.<p>With a completely centralized system, you have one of the following going on:<p>A.  You don't actually do code reviews before pushing changes, and trunk is broken half the time.<p>B.  You wait all the time on your changes being reviewed, and you can't commit them until they have been.<p>C.  You revert to tarballs and diffs for dealing with different changesets.<p>I was forcibly pushed into using git from svn, but now I'd never go back: its simply <i>so much easier</i> to say ""OK, I'm done with this change, I'll commit it!"" and not have to wait for everyone else to be in the office/online/available to look at the changes before I do so.<p>This is especially important when dealing with separate changesets that necessary depend on each other, where you can't merely make a new branch for the new change because it requires the old changes.",1227497154

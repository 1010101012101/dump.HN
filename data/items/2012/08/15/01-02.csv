4384010,comment,4378872,4382970,1,0,einhverfr,,,"The problem of course is that not all vaccines are given for herd immunity reasons.  Pertussis herd immunity really only exists among kids, and one way to read this is that while this is important in the public school setting, the fact is that the disease will never be controlled in the wild.  The CDC makes ever longer lists of Pertussis vaccination recommendations but we have no way of really knowing what's required and once people reach the age of majority, society doesn't have many options, so relatively short-lived immunity as in that vaccine is not a global herd immunity issue but rather an attempt to control herd immunity in a very specific setting.<p>Similarly, you are never going to get enough herd immunity to make a flu vaccine worthy of mandating for this reason but that doesn't keep the CDC from issuing recommendations.<p>Vaccines are given for a number of reasons.  Some truly present population-wide herd immunity considerations (Measles, Polio, possibly to a far lesser extent Diphtheria, but that is complicated by the fact that we simply don't know how common sub-clinical diphtheria is in vaccinated populations given that the vaccine targets exotoxins rather than the organism itself).<p>The vaccination regimes have become out of control.  There is no need to require the vast number of vaccines that are routinely given today.  Stick with the big ones.  Don't require all the others.  Use the others in the case of individualized risk.  Yes, I know the autism theorists suggest the big vaccines are to blame but there is little evidence there.  However, aside from MMR, DTaP, and Polio, there are few diseases out there which are so severe a menace to public health and safety that we can't just let people decide on their own.",1344995168

Apparently Milikan when he measured the electric charge was off (smaller than actual) in the measurements... but researchers who checked, worried perhaps about their academic reputation (speculating here) slowly adjusted this number upwards over several years till it asymptotically approached the truth. Having a 3rd-party, that is less impacted by academic politics might be a good thing.<p>From Feynman's Caltech commencement speech on this:<p><i>We have learned a lot from experience about how to handle some of\nthe ways we fool ourselves. One example: Millikan measured the\ncharge on an electron by an experiment with falling oil drops, and\ngot an answer which we now know not to be quite right. It's a\nlittle bit off, because he had the incorrect value for the\nviscosity of air. It's interesting to look at the history of\nmeasurements of the charge of the electron, after Millikan. If you\nplot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little\nbigger than Millikan's, and the next one's a little bit bigger than\nthat, and the next one's a little bit bigger than that, until\nfinally they settle down to a number which is higher.</i><p><i>Why didn't they discover that the new number was higher right away?\nIt's a thing that scientists are ashamed of--this history--because\nit's apparent that people did things like this: When they got a\nnumber that was too high above Millikan's, they thought something\nmust be wrong--and they would look for and find a reason why\nsomething might be wrong. When they got a number closer to\nMillikan's value they didn't look so hard. And so they eliminated\nthe numbers that were too far off, and did other things like that.\nWe've learned those tricks nowadays, and now we don't have that\nkind of a disease.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/cargocul.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/cargocul.htm</a>",1344994799

To do so, he needed $8,500  a sum that is close to the average annual income in Colombia. The problem is that financial aid and student loans are far less abundant in Colombia than they are in the United States. Sneider, who was unable to provide collateral or a cosigner, had little hope of getting a loan from a traditional lender.<p>Heres the deal that Lumni struck with him: In exchange for $8,530 in financing, Sneider agreed to repay 14 percent of his salary for 118 months after he graduated. At that point, regardless of how much he has paid, his obligation terminates. Although this might sound similar to a loan, an income contingent repayment plan like this is far less risky for a low-income student like Sneider. >><p><a href=""http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/30/instead-of-student-loans-investing-in-futures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/30/instead-of-s...</a><p>Enzi is doing something similar, over a longer time period:<p><< Enzi, another start-up, has just put students from India and Iran through Stanford University; they are paying investors up to 6% of their income for five years.

As it turned out, the bus drivers were nearly twice as likely to die of heart disease as the conductors were.<p>A more recent interpretation of that study, published in 2004, found that none of the participants ever exercised.

4383890,comment,4383243,4383812,3,0,dredmorbius,,,"Fair points.  And thanks, by the way, for actually advancing the discussion.<p>Init <i>can</i> and <i>does</i> manage processes.  Somewhat crudely, mostly via the 'respawn' directive. One thing it <i>isn't</i> particularly good at is telling if a process is doing something useful (say, serving out web pages successfully), but it <i>will</i> let you know that it's running. There was a semi-popular hack some years back to run sshd out of init (via respawn) to ensure you always had an SSH daemon on your box (Dustin mentions this). The downside is that while it will ensure sshd is running, it doesn't give you much flexibility over the process (you've got to edit inittab and 'init q' to make changes).<p>What monit and kin can do, above and beyond process-level monitoring, is check that the <i>service attributes</i> of a process are sane.  That a webserver, say, kicks out a 200 OK response rather than a 4## or 5## error, and restart the service if this isn't the case.  Checking for <i>correct</i> operation can be more useful than simply verifying a process is running (though going too far overboard in defining ""correctness"" can also cause problems).<p>For realtime/HA tools, attacking things on the single-system level is probably the wrong way to roll.  You want a load balancer in front of multiple hosts with response detection -- is host A still up or not?  Whether or not this ties into mitigation (restart) or alerting (notifications to staff) is another matter.<p>There are also places other than init you can watch things from.  /proc contains within it multitudes, including a lot of interesting/useful process state.  Daemons can be written with control/monitoring sockets instrumented directly into themselves.  Debuggers, strace, ltrace, dtrace, and systemtap all provide resolution inside a running process/thread.  Creating something sane, effective, efficient, and sufficient out of all these tools ... interesting problem.",1344992462

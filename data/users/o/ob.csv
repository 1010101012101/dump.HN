objectivistbrit,9,"Web programmer based in London, UK. Objectivist.<p>I have another HN account under my real name but started this one to state the case for Ayn Rand&#x27;s Objectivist philosophy.<p>Answers to Frequently Raised Points:<p>1. &quot;I loved Atlas Shrugged and the Fountainhead as a teenager, but now I&#x27;m older I see it as simplistic and flawed.&quot;<p>A: I&#x27;d recommend 1) reading Rand&#x27;s deeper non-fiction [1], which grounds her political views in her broader philosophy and 2) re-reading her fiction, within which you might discover new complexities and nuances.<p>[1] The Romantic Manifesto & Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology would be a challenging intellectual workout for anyone; Philosophy: Who Needs It would be a good general overview.<p>2. &#x27;How the hell did Rand think she could derive &quot;capitalism is good&quot; from &quot;A is A&quot;?&#x27;<p>A: This confuses a lot of people. The thing to realise is that the Rand isn&#x27;t setting up a deductive system, like those of Leibniz or Spinoza, where you state a few axioms and then derive the rest of your propositions from those. Objectivism isn&#x27;t geometry.<p>The simplest explanation is that Objectivism treats concepts, not propositions, as the basic units of knowledge. Concepts are integrations of things which exist in the world. You form the concept &quot;society&quot; by observing the existence of different societies. You form the concept &quot;rights&quot; by relating the concept &quot;society&quot; to the concepts &quot;man&quot;, &quot;ethics&quot;, and so on, then you relate those concepts to more fundamental concepts, until you reach the most basic concepts of all: existence, identity and consciousness. Chapter 6 of Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology has more on this.<p>3. &#x27;How does a British guy end up a Randroid?&#x27;<p>I was vaguely libertarian as a teenager. I was drawn to study computer science, and later became interested in startups, as I valued transforming ideas into physical reality. Over time I became more and more convinced that the VC game tends to reward dishonesty, exploitation, and wilful self-delusion, and that capitalism was only good insofar as individual entrepreneurs were virtuous and principled.<p>I&#x27;d ignored Rand as I thought she had expressed the exact opposite of my opinions. Then I actually read her writings, and discovered that she agreed with all my fundamental convictions, and, furthermore, that she&#x27;d had drawn out ramifications which I&#x27;d never even considered.<p>4. &#x27;Why haven&#x27;t you considered $NOVEL_POINT?&#x27;<p>At this stage, I almost certainly have. I spent several years in my early twenties exploring many alternative philosophies, from Buddhism to Effective Altruism to Bayesianism to 1960&#x27;s psychadelic counter-culture, so I consider myself knowledgable in broad intellectual trends. When you get down to essentials, most ideas in history are simply new combinations of existing premises.<p>Once I finally read into Objectivism in-depth, I realised that , of all the worldviews I&#x27;d encountered, it offered the most systematic set of answers to the fundamental questions. The secret to Rand&#x27;s success was, in essence, applying Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy to the modern world.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m happy to answer honest questions from all comers - just reply to my latest comment and I&#x27;ll answer when I have time.",1452712485,1453175331

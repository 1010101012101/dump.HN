You don&#x27;t actually want to code, but you have a long, generally enjoyable history with it.  It&#x27;s hard to give up something that has worked well for us in the past, even if it&#x27;s not working well now.  Our actual self changes much quicker than our self-image does, particularly in the teens and 20s.<p>2. You do want to code, but you are afraid of not measuring up to some external standard.  In this case - forget the external standard.  Other people&#x27;s ideas of fame & approval don&#x27;t matter, only your own.<p>It&#x27;s pretty common in our 20s to re-evaluate all the stuff we thought we liked & were good at, but really just fell into because that&#x27;s what we did when we were kids and we were too afraid to give it up.  I would get up off the couch and turn off the games, TVs and movies - but don&#x27;t force yourself to code if it&#x27;s not really what you want to be doing.

If you have experience writing crawlers and have been able to afford the time to learn to write them well, you&#x27;ve basically already reinvented the wheel. But now you also have to maintain the wheel. We think it would be better if people started working together on the problem of structuring the web. Besides running infrastructure (which has it&#x27;s own challenges), there is really no reason why everyone needs to build their own extractor for every website. People generally want to extract the same things, and just a handful of quality implementations should be enough to satisfy almost everyone.<p>One of the keys to actually having an extractor repository is providing incentive for people to build and maintain the extractors, which is actually where we&#x27;re headed once we allow developers to start building their own applications on the Analysis Engine.<p>If you&#x27;re good at extracting structured data from HTML, you should continue writing your own extractors and even consider selling access to them. On the other hand, if you can&#x27;t be bothered learning the art of extracting data, why not pay someone to use their commercial grade extractor?<p>So, to summarize, you should use our API so that you can better leverage your time and contribute to the creation of even better structuring tools.<p>We really like the stuff that Kimono and Import.IO are working on. They are significantly lowering the barriers to getting started at extracting/structuring data, which is great for everyone. Of course there are limitations to what their tools can do, but that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll see every time someone attempts to simplify a complicated process. We aim to be the glue that connects people with data acquisition, structuring, and analysis tools.<p>Crawling social media is pretty tough because social platforms tend to be very reserved about access to their data (probably due to the enormous amount of personal data they have). It&#x27;s a disturbing trend for sites to require an account before they even let you past the landing page. It&#x27;s basically not publicly available data anymore.

You need to use the exchange rate at the day of the sale</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure this is exactly correct. For the UK, the guidance[1] at the moment says:<p>&quot;If you charge or invoice customers in a currency other than the one used by the MSI and you record that price in your accounts in the foreign currency, you must:<p>- convert it into the MSI currency at the end of each quarter<p>- use the conversion rate published by the European Central Bank (ECB) on the last working day of the quarter<p>However, if to meet VAT invoicing or other accounting requirements you convert the foreign currency into the MSI currency using an agreed published daily or monthly conversion rate, you can use this converted figure when completing your quarterly VAT MOSS return.&quot;<p>In the above, &quot;Member State of Identification (MSI) is the state in which you’ve registered for VAT MOSS.&quot;<p>So it looks as though there are three possibilities here:<p>1. If you charge customers in your own native currency, then you just have to apply their location&#x27;s tax rate on the transaction, instead of applying your local tax rate as at present.<p>2. If you charge customers in their own currency (or any other that isn&#x27;t your native one) then you have two options:<p>2a. You convert the amount charged to your native currency at the time of the charge, and use that figure and the customer location&#x27;s tax rate to calculate the tax due.<p>2b. You record the transaction in its actual currency at the time of the charge, and then later you convert to your native currency according to the standardised exchange rate published by the ECB at the end of each quarter, use that figure to calculate the tax due, and use these figures when you file your MOSS return for the quarter that just finished.<p>But I&#x27;m not an accountant, and like many here I&#x27;ve spent too much time in recent weeks just trying to get straight answers and figure out what all the &quot;guidance&quot; really means, not to mention trying to find out minor details like what the current tax rates to use for each location actually are (including variations within individual member states) and how we&#x27;re supposed to keep up with any changes in the future.

A koan is designed to make that part tired until it gives up. In that way, the inability to make progress with the puzzle itself is a design feature of a koan.

Meditation is weird in that way, in that it&#x27;s not about learning to play the piano, but learning to play the piano player. So to speak.<p>Also, boredom goes away eventually.

8770451,comment,8767203,8767203,0,0,csandreasen,,,"I don&#x27;t think the EFF is going to win this one.  It&#x27;s not because of some government conspiracy, or the odds being stacked against them or anything like that, but rather because their argument is flawed.  As detailed elsewhere on the EFF&#x27;s site[1], the core of their case centers around NSA&#x27;s Section 702 Upstream collection.  They have more recently hinged their argument on the Privacy and Civil Liberty Oversight Board report on Section 702[2], but the case predates it going back as far as Mark Klein&#x27;s Room 641A disclosure.  The identifiers that the EFF talks about are described in the report as follows:<p><i>As noted above, however, all upstream collection — of which “about” collection is a\nsubset — is “selector-based, i.e., based on . . . things like phone numbers or emails.” Just\nas in PRISM collection, a selector used as a basis for upstream collection “is not a ‘keyword’\nor particular term (e.g., ‘nuclear’ or ‘bomb’) but must be a specific communications\nidentifier (e.g., email address).” In other words, the government’s collection devices are\nnot searching for references to particular topics or ideas, but only for references to specific\ncommunications selectors used by people who have been targeted under Section 702.</i><p>In other words, the NSA is searching for the communications of specific people - it&#x27;s targeted collection.  The EFF itself even concedes that they are filtering out wholly domestic communications[3].  Instead of questioning the specific procedures for targeting these people, the likelihood that they may fail and collect an innocent bystander&#x27;s communications, the procedures dealing with incidental or accidental collection, etc., they are instead taking the stance that the filtering itself is illegal because a packet filter needs to see a packet before determining whether or not it matches the specific communication.  As an analogy, if where to pull up my terminal and run:<p><pre><code>  $ seq 1 3 | grep -v 2 | grep 3 > out.txt\n</code></pre>\n... the government is arguing that the collection is the contents of out.txt (&quot;3&quot;) and furthermore, they put an extra measure in place to ensure that the number 2 (i.e. purely domestic communications) is never collected.  The EFF is arguing that 1, 2 and 3 are all collected because each one exists in grep&#x27;s buffer for a millisecond before it is discarded - it doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s never seen by a human, entered into a database, written to disk or transmitted elsewhere.<p>I think I see why the EFF is making that argument: in Clapper v. Amnesty International it was ruled that the plaintiff didn&#x27;t have standing because they couldn&#x27;t show that their specific communications had been collected.  Jewel v. NSA would likely have the same issue, so to get around it the EFF is instead arguing that the very fact that the NSA is conducting any sort of packet filtering itself constitutes a search and seizure, regardless what safeguards are put in place or whether the filtering is targeted.  I think they&#x27;re grasping for straws with this one - I&#x27;d be really surprised if they win.  If I were in their place, I&#x27;d probably FOIA the hell out of the 702 procedures and look for loopholes instead.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-asks-judge-rule-nsa-internet-backbone-spying-techniques-unconstitutional"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-asks-judge-rule-nsa-i...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.pclob.gov/Library/702-Report-2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pclob.gov/Library/702-Report-2.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/files/2014/07/24/backbone-3c-color.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/files/2014/07/24/backbone-3c-color.jpg</a>",1418948027

Alexandria has the privilege of being trusted by whatever organization she belongs to (be that her country, company, etc) and as such is unmonitored AFAsheKs. Biblo on the other hand is some fugitive-type and is unable, or perhaps unwilling, to enter direct communication with Alexandria for fear of compromising himself or his beloved Alexandria. Bilbo could then monitor Alexandria&#x27;s calls for an encoded message via a protocol they predetermine. This protocol could take the form of linguistic or audio steganography. One could image all sorts of information being leaked by Alexandria.<p>2. More realistically this could be tool for bribery.

Out of the infosec CIA triad, this is still an Availability fail. Your one and only available recourse is... &quot;keep refreshing&quot;, hoping that the Gods of Routing will put your request on the right path, which in the case of intentional sabotage would probably be never[1]. Let&#x27;s emphasize at this point that you don&#x27;t need MiTM for this, just a rogue ASN somewhere advertising a super-quick route to $ta.rg.e.t. In most cases, that would sinkhole at least the continent. So, IMHO, still broken, even if we will be able to know <i>when</i> it is broken (at some point in the future). Which brings me to DNSSEC/DANE.<p>TLS can indeed offset its CA burdens onto DANE, when DANE becomes a thing[2] <i>and</i> DNSSEC becomes ubiquitous[3]. We are so far away from that, that even google hasn&#x27;t bothered with DNSSEC[4]. Considering the enormous infrastructure changes that this requires, we&#x27;ll hardly be getting our money&#x27;s worth - still a strict top-down system: IANA/Verisign have the root-root zone/keys. Verisign  &quot;owns&quot; .coms (root zone), as well as most (all?) other gTLDs.<p>TACK is a proposed TLS extension for certificate pinning for the masses. It doesn&#x27;t solve DNSSEC problems (not its scope), but requires far fewer infrastructure updates to be implemented. It is also not perfect[5] but still a much closer/realistic goal than DANE. We need something <i>yesterday</i> - the green lock icon means fuck-all right now.<p>And finally:<p>> I don&#x27;t think BGP needs to be fixed at all, the underlying problem is inherent to the Internet, changing the protocol will only close one of the several different ways for stealing data.<p>Strongly disagree.

The client must be its own recursive nameserver (don&#x27;t trust your ISP), and all recursive nameservers until the authoritative one need to speak DNSSEC as well (I think). Of course, the g/cc TLD also needs to support DNSSEC (not all do), the owners of the site must have set it up properly, etc. After all that is ubiquitous enough to you <i>enforce</i> DANE for proper TLS (&quot;green icon&quot;), you just need to update all clients everywhere with the new rules.  We&#x27;re currently at step 0.1 of this process - the root zones for most g/cc TLDs are there, and that&#x27;s about it.<p>[4a] <a href=""http://dnsviz.net/d/google.com/dnssec/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dnsviz.net/d/google.com/dnssec/</a><p>[4b] <a href=""http://dnsviz.net/d/whitehouse.gov/dnssec/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dnsviz.net/d/whitehouse.gov/dnssec/</a> (for comparison)<p>[4c] <a href=""http://www.dnssec-name-and-shame.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dnssec-name-and-shame.com/</a> (NOISY site - be warned) Test out a few top alexa sites.

Not really; terrorist attacks could have declined for other reasons.<p>The only way to be sure of the effectiveness of the TSA would be to keep relaxing TSA restrictions until a terrorist successfully attacks a plane, and then ratchet them back up to the minimum point necessary to prevent it again.  Will they do that?  No.  So, the only alternative is to over-protect to some degree.<p>For example, should we still screen checked baggage for bombs?  There have been no luggage bombings since Lockerbie, so maybe they're not necessary anymore.  These checks are certainly expensive.  I think the answer is obviously yes, because such an attack is ""too damn easy.""<p>However, it's terribly difficult to draw the line when things get less obvious, because the odds of an attack increase as the difficulty of such an attack decreases.  How many plane bombings would there be if all you had to do was click on a link in a web browser?  A hundred thousand (or the population of Gaza).

4944052,comment,4943285,4943965,2,0,rayiner,,,"Entertain the assumption that patents as property is the right way to go. In that case, no, it is not better if the patents are simply freed up for the world to use in the case of bankruptcy. Companies count on being able to sell their patent portfolio if things go south, just like with any other asset. If the rules were such that the property right disappears as soon as the inventor stops being able to produce products based on the patents, then the patents become much more ephemeral property rights, and the incentive to invest in patents is reduced, because businesses don't like to deal with fragile rights.<p>I'll use a concrete example. I used to work for a startup where the only thing we really did was develop technology. We protected our technology with patents. We had no interest in getting mired in competing with big companies in producing actual products, because that wasn't a game we could win--whoever had the best supply chain/cheapest Chinese labor would win that battle. In the case of that company, if dissolution of the business meant losing the patents to the public domain instead of being able to sell them off, then we would have been very hestitant to invest in the technology in the first place. It would have meant that if we couldn't go forward as a successful business, we couldn't just sell off our assets and cut our losses. Rather, we would have done years of research with nothing to show for it. From a business point of view, there is a lot of value in being able to treat a patent like any other piece of property, which you can buy, sell, leverage in bankruptcy, etc.<p>You can't just consider the case where good patents get put into the public domain. You have to balance that against all the cases where people don't invest in technology because they consider the resulting patents too fragile. And I know on HN people develop technology just for the thrill of it (in their free time no less), but in most of the engineering field technology development is extremely capital intensive, and reducing the value of patents by making them ephemeral would discourage R&D investment.",1355943218

They seemed to have tried to take an even bigger stance pro-VP8, than Google itself, at least publicly. Google could've made the WebM player the default one for Youtube a long time ago, and only leave the Flash one as fallback, much like Apple took the stance with h.264 and gave up on Flash years ago, and then jumpstart the momentum for VP8. But they never did that. Mozilla alone certainly didn't have the power to turn the whole web towards VP8.

4943914,comment,4905684,4942410,1,0,hackinthebochs,,,"I'm sorry but you're really under- and mis-informed here. Evolutionary Psychology is a bit of a misnomer, it doesn't attempt to explain the mechanisms by which genes act on the mental to influence or create behaviors. It simply provides an explanation for the set of selective pressures and economic interactions that result in certain behaviors. It very much side-steps the question of psychology altogether. It is similar to the behavioral model of psychology in that it studies behaviors (and their likely genetic basis) rather than trying to divine mental states.<p>EP as a field is very much testable and falsifiable. Take the study that showed human women in economically depressed areas choose more masculine mates compared to more economically well-off areas. An EP theory would be that in an environment of scarcity and uncertainty, it is beneficial to mate with stronger males for the sake of protection and competition. Such an environment could be set up that controls for scarcity of food, level of testosterone in the males, etc. We could then measure the economic benefit of such a mate choice and the resultant improvement in selection fitness. The theory could be validated/refuted based on that. Of course, its applicability to humans would still be in question, but if animal models match the observed patterns in humans, that would be strong evidence in itself.<p>EP is based on a few assumptions, all of which have a preponderance of evidence in their favor. That genes influence behavior and that gene selection follows laws of economics.<p>I really don't understand most people's grief with EP. Perhaps you could explain it to me? Is it the fact that its theories aren't directly observable? Well, so is much of every scientific result. Evolution itself has been proven by the massive amounts of indirect evidence in its favor. Do you dislike the fact that EP removes some of our autonomy? Well, science has been slowly chipping away at that for decades. EP simply provides a framework to understand our behavior outside of the (dying) view of pure free-will.<p>>You imply that I know nothing about science yet you say a book that is largely speculating on what might have happened and why it might have happened is 100% science.<p>Please, explain to me what about The Selfish Gene is unscientific. If you honestly call the content of this book ""speculating on what might have happened"", then you either didn't read it or didn't understand a bit of it. The book provided a (mostly new at the time) look on a gene-centric view of selection and provided a framework that better explained the behaviors of various organisms that we see today. It is not speculation: it is informed, testable and falsifiable. Science is a framework for understanding the world; not studies and soundbites. It is a process of refining these frameworks in the face of new evidence and new ideas.  E=MC^2 is much more than just the soundbite people have made it out to be; it was an entirely new look at the universe and how matter and energy are intimately connected. It's a shame that the vast majority of people only see it as a soundbite, and as a consequence think soundbites are the entirety of science.",1355941593

4943897,comment,4942943,4942943,5,0,marshray,,,"<p><pre><code>     $time = date('mdYHis'); // Probably in the database somewhere too
     $rand = mt_rand().'\n'; // Said to be a 31 bit number
     $crypt = crypt($user.$time.$rand); // DES crypt is 64-bits output
</code></pre>
Since ""$crypt"" is time-varying, he's got to be storing $crypt in the database as the seed along with the password hash. This system is no better than a weakly-generated random 64-bit seed.<p>It's reasonable to assume the attacker knows the username. If the attacker knows the time the user was created, he can easily brute force the 31 bits of $rand. PHP mt_rand is not seeded with more than 32 bits of entropy, so with knowlege of just two (username, time, seed) entries the attacker learns the values of all other mt_rand numbers (past and future) generated by this PHP process. This may have significant implications for the security of other parts of the system.<p><pre><code>    function hash_it($string1, $string2) {
        // Equivalent complexity to:
        return sha1($crypt, md5($password)).
    }

    $hash = hash_it($password, $crypt);
</code></pre>
So the resulting hash is 160 bits long, by interposing MD5 it is guaranteed to not contain more than 128 bits of entropy. If nothing else, this is a waste of space.<p>In my estimation, this scheme is about 0.5 bits stronger than plain SHA-1 like Linkedin was using. 90% the Linkedin passwords have been cracked.

4943790,comment,4942943,4942943,2,0,thaumaturgy,,,"The main problem here IMO is that this thing will be used to store passwords for a longer period of time than anyone will spend bothering to break it now. So you store your entire password database this way, then two years from now you get breached, and both your database and your code gets exposed.<p>Then, you <i>might</i> benefit from nobody wanting to bother to spend the energy to reverse-engineer your one-off GoofHash(). But, then again, maybe not. Maybe the fact that all of the passwords have been effectively hashed using single iterations of fast trivial algorithms like SHA1 and MD5 will mean that a ton of your users' passwords could be calculated in a short period of time.<p>In that scenario, you're gambling instead of relying on battle-tested approaches. Maybe the gamble will pay off, probably it won't, but when the battle-tested approaches have been examined by a lot of really smart people and found to be solid, why not use them instead?<p>Or, put another way: you're going to have to play a game of dice against Death. You have a choice between playing with a set of dice that thousands of people have rolled over and over again and found to be fair so far, or a set of dice that some dude just rolled for the first time a minute ago and declared to be fair. Which do you choose?<p>edit: I am an idiot. If someone gets the code and DB, they won't have to reverse-engineer anything; this is just a fast MD5/SHA1 combo, a bunch of passwords could be brute-forced in a short period of time.",1355940079

For god's sake, they hired Pat Russo as President and COO.  Hilariously, Lucent hired her back as CEO; her performance was so miserable that Lucent had to sell itself (Alcatel bought it).<p>Let me repeat that:  Kodak installed a top-level person who later killed a company that invented the transistor, solid-state laser, Unix, and information theory.<p>In another anecdote:  Through a circuitous route, I got involved with a presentation to George Fisher (Kodak CEO) around 1996.  They were looking for how to allot their $400M research budget between old-fashioned silver-halide films and digital photography.<p>Suffice to say:  They absolutely saw the writing on the wall and were pouring money into the digital imaging revolution.  They had very serious engineering talent, which brings me to my original point:  Their management sucked.<p>Edit:  Search for Kodak on the list of all-time worst CEOs here:  <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/the-worst-ceos-in-american-history-2010-5?op=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/the-worst-ceos-in-american-hi...</a><p>(Side note:  Guess who is Lead Director of the Board at GM?

I've seen a full range of reaction: some students would completely qualify why they did everything, and be able to either discard useless criticism and incorporate the good; others would completely reject it: combativeness was either anger or sadness. Once, a girl cried because the professor (very politely) said that she needed to increase the contrast in her photos. The explanation, much like Knight's, was ""well, I <i>tried</i> hard, isn't that good enough?""<p>And the answer is no, unfortunately.

It's not Facebook or Twitter of course, but it looks very solid for a niche community.<p>Which begs the question: why is outside capital needed here? Usage-wise, this site has enough scale relative to the niche that it should be able to monetize its popularity. This hardly seems like a case of needs-more-employees, needs-more-servers, needs-more-marketing -- things that capital is best applied to.<p>On the flip side, as a niche community play, COLOURlovers isn't exactly the kind of site with the kind of growth potential startup investors have traditionally looked for. So while there may be a lot of ""founder friendly, fast moving seed capital"" out there right now, so the fact that the founder ""just raised a large seed round from some of the top VCs and Angels"" demonstrates the fact that there are an awful lot of angels and VCs who are stretching to put their money to work.

In my experience people LIKE being productive and don't like working crazy hours, so it's also much easier.<p>Top hits in my experience:<p>Is the physical environment conducive to productivity? 
Comfortable/ergonomic setting, fast powerful hardware with lots of screen real estate, does the office allow for uninterrupted focused work and good communication.<p>Is the work environment conducive to productivity?
Are the software tools low drag?  Is the process setup to allow developers to focus on 1-24 hour sized tasks (optimal size may vary) without interruption and having to multi-task on 12 things at once?  Are your programmers protected from random management interference?<p>There are tons of factors that go into this as well, having your manager or team lead protecting and empowering you versus cracking the whip, making it easy to keep blood sugar at happy levels, having the programmers be interested in the work, have the programmers understand the value of the work and be invested in the success of the project.<p>I would much rather have programmers working 6 hours a day, focused, motivated, and productive, than 12 hours a day, checking facebooks, switching between 12 different ""SUPER URGENT"" tasks all day, etc....",1300131513

Considering only languages that are in reasonably widespread practical use today, rather than some hypothetical ideal, we see that a declarative style can lead to very neat expressions of pure data manipulation, but is often less effective when we're dealing with side effects and a time dimension. In contrast, an imperative style puts things like timing and side effects front and centre, but tends to lack both the elegance and the safety that more declarative abstractions can bring. Both approaches have their strengths, but for a general purpose programming language, I don't believe either is ideal on its own.<p>Is it a stretch to think that future languages will support both better ways of describing real-world processes (things with a time dimension and effects that might interact) and better ways to describe pure data manipulations without specifying irrelevant details? Would a language that made a sharp distinction between these two goals, instead of trying to bend both aspects into a single programming style, be counted as a new ""type"" of language?<p>One could imagine a similar ""middle ground"" debate between other extremes as well. Again, most mainstream languages today are basically either statically typed or dynamically typed, though we do see a few common overlaps, such as polymorphic OO function call dispatch and ""variant"" types in otherwise statically typed languages. Would a language that was statically typed by default but natively supported dynamic typing within the system look like anything we see today? What about a language that was basically dynamically typed but supported type annotations for checking some properties at run-time, or in advance? How does that compare to the kind of type inference we see in some of the more expressive static type systems today? Again, there are already a few languages that are experimenting with some of these ideas, but I suspect they are a long way from becoming the norm yet, if indeed they ever do.<p>I think we'll see plenty of innovation in programming language design for a long time to come, but at the lower-level end of the language spectrum it will mostly be in cleaner ways to blend between extremes that each have both strengths and weaknesses. I also expect we'll get much better at supporting things on a larger scale, where I think so far we're barely scratching the surface of how to build interacting, independent systems involving concurrency, distributed execution, fault tolerance, high performance, etc.",1300130492

Note, I had to count by twos, because when I counted by ones, I got a ""maximum recursion limit exceeded"" error.<p>Basically, the concept is to call f recursively, until you get to 999 (and had printed 999 and 1000), at which time you call some non-recursive function (I call ""int"").<p>At 999, the inner-called f function terminates, leading to the unwinding of the stack (each previous f function terminating), and then the program ends.<p>This statement is the hard one to understand:<p><pre><code>        {999: int}.get(a,f)(a+2)

Basically, it's saying ""Look up 'a' in this hard-coded dictionary that only has one value in it - for 999.  If 'a' isn't found (as it won't be most of the time), set the look-up value to the function called 'f'.  Otherwise, set the look-up value to the function called 'int'.

When you run into bugs day in and out, it's easy to reinforce this belief. Afterall, how can someone who claims to have all this experience and knowledge make such an obvious mistake? They're paid a salary and millions of people trust their software! <i>I could do it better</i>. The reality I believe is that these sorts of people are really compensating for the flaws they themselves are prone to making. When they catch these sorts of errors, they're just reinforcing patterns they themselves recognize as bad; likely because they themselves have made such a mistake in the past that someone else had pointed out to them. So when they call someone an ""idiot,"" they're really calling themselves an ""idiot,"" and bringing the other person down with them to bolster their sense of self worth.<p>The truth is that we all are guilty of making mistakes. Operating systems that run the Internet, control nuclear reactors, and send really expensive robots into space all have bugs. They have security flaws. And they were written by individuals who've spent a significant amount of time paying their dues in the ivory tower and working their way up the career ladder.

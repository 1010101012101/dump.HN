I remember driving on I-280 in the late nineties when Jobs had just gotten back to Apple and they were doing their Think Different campaign. There was a huge billboard of Einstein right by the exit to the Apple campus. I had been an Apple fan since the early eighties; to see this and know their founder was back and they were doing great things again literally brought a tear to my eye. ;)",1286236770

I mean heck, at the end of the day the results came back however Google sorted them, and I only did the first few pages of search results. It wasn't much fun taking all day to type in books, but from the voting here it looks like it had some value to you guys.<p>So, I guess I would be a completely bad HN'er and wouldn't have learned anything from being here if I didn't ask you guys the obvious question: should this become a small app instead of just a blog entry? I was thinking something along the lines of RottenTomatoes, only for startup books. I could harvest data from several technical sites and aggregate in one place.<p>I can't promise to listen to any of your opinions (so what's new there?) but I'm interested in what the community thinks about the app. I know there's a boatload of other book-type apps out there, but nobody doing the meta-harvesting thing like I describe. Plus it's something I could hack together in a week, month tops. And I'm working on very similar code right now for my other project, code which would drop quite nicely into something like this. Might make for a nice testing platform.<p>Worthwhile useful idea -- something that people want -- or just another wannabe web application?",1286236395

Plus, sandbox is already available from C -- see: `man 7 sandbox`.<p>Anyway, I imagine tptacek (or anyone who knows more about security than I do) can explain this better than I can, but, I'll give it a shot: In limiting your process, you're preventing an unknown state from happening within your process. Its another level of control that you can use to ensure that your program will only do what you programmed it to do and that it <i>can't</i> do anything else.<p>One part of how this sandboxing works is that any process spawned will also be contained within the sandbox. So, say there is a vulnerability -- in your code, in a gem you use, whatever -- the point is, there is a vulnerability. Maybe it will give an evil nasty person remote access to your system, or perhaps a local user can use it to gain privileges that they shouldn't have. Or something else that I'm not thinking of.<p>Anyway, as a result of a vulnerability, the user now has access to your system. Or maybe they have more access than they should. You can use Sandbox to forcibly limit how much access a process and child processes can have. You can make it so that a process can't write to any directory except the temporary directory that it uses and block access to the internet. Make it harder for the evil nasty person to break, steal or otherwise continue doing things that they shouldn't be doing.<p>// edit: to summarize: No matter how safe your Ruby code happens to be, if you use an unsafe C extension, you're screwed if you're not using sandbox(7).",1286235540

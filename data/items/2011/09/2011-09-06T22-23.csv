Having users post content on an open website allows you to shrug off a lot of these problems compared to actually publishing it yourself. A lot of the content on Reddit consists in writing from people using throwaway accounts they'll never check again (i.e. /r/IAmA, /r/AskReddit, etc.) or in ""borrowing"" images from pop culture or random strangers where it may be impossible to ever track down or secure the rights for (i.e. /r/vertical and /r/adviceanimals).<p>And there's nothing stopping someone other than Reddit from monetizing all that content the same way. If I wanted to, I could send private messages to hundreds of Redditors and get permission to include their comments in a self-help book gleaned from AskReddit comments, and Reddit would have absolutely no advantage over me in doing this, nor any way to stop me. As far as any content on Reddit goes, the story is the same way. Just as Hacker Weekly operates independent of YC and the people who run HN.<p>I think if you want to monetize Reddit, monetizing the audience isn't the only way.

2967596,comment,2965891,2967373,1,0,jrockway,,,"Yes, but they aren't connecting it to line voltage.  I imagine the intended application for this particular chip is to be part of a battery charge circuit, and so those pins are going to be at 1.2V instead of 120V as in your application.<p>(The datasheet doesn't mention this because the IC can theoretically sink infinite voltage.  The input current is put into the chip only to go through a carefully-placed piece of copper that maximizes the effectiveness of the Hall effect sensor.  The only limit that matters to the chip is heat production, which depends on the resistance of that piece of copper and the amount of current flowing through it.  Voltage simply doesn't affect the chip in any way, so there's no reason to set any limits.)<p>The problem I see with your current design is that isolating the line voltage from the container is going to be difficult.  Line voltage appears on 8 different places; the four connection areas (top and bottom), and the four input pins on the IC itself.  Without potting it in epoxy, you're not going to be able to isolate all that from an errant chip of metal that happens to enter the enclosure.  And that's all it would take to burn down your house; a little chip of metal gets between the pins but doesn't make very good contact.  As current flows, it gets hotter and hotter until it sets the enclosure on fire.  (Your circuit breaker will trip if this causes your device to draw more than 20 amps, as a clean short would, but 2400W is more than enough to start a fire.)<p>Ultimately, you have to keep in mind that you can pull a lot of power out of your house's outlets.  This power can kill you or start a fire, so when you are wiring it up to something, you need to think about how your device could possibly fail and protect against it.  What if the cover falls off?  What if a piece of metal shorts the line voltage to your Arduino's USB port?  What if a connection is faulty and gets hot?<p>This much paranoia is warranted when a minor mistake could kill someone.  Is knowing that your TV is on worth dying in a fire for? :)<p>Now, the good news is that you can make a device that works just as well as this one without having to touch the wire going to the TV.  The only reason you have the TV connected through the current-sensing chip is to get the current that the TV's drawing very close to the Hall effect sensor.  This will let you make milliamp-level measurements very accurately.  But you don't need that accuracy, so taping a Hall effect sensor to the TV's cord will be just as good, and will be intrinsically safe.  (I think a few loops of wire will work too, but I just tried this and it didn't work.  YMMV.  I didn't have any magnet wire, so I used a long piece of wire stolen from a radio antenna.)<p>(This is assuming that my photoresistor-near-the-TV's-power-LED idea doesn't work, of course.)<p>Finally, the Arduino is likely overkill for this application.  Something like an op-amp set up as a comparator and connected to a free serial port pin would work just as well, and cost you 1 cent instead of 20 bucks :)<p>Anyway, I'm looking forward to version two; this is a great project and your proof of concept is excellent.  But you can make the device simpler, safer, and cheaper; so why not spend an afternoon doing that.  The increase in sleep from not having nightmares about the thing catching on fire should definitely make up for the time invested in doing so :)",1315349291

Tell them YOUR story ... and .. what YOU would do differently ...<p>> Use your friends<p>These are good bits of advice. I would also encourage folks here to realize just how far programming is from what most people do all day. When you live in Windows XP all day, grew up with Windows, and spend your time talking with people about, in my case, medicine, and family in the evenings, programming isn't even on the periphery. It's on the other side of a freaking ocean. In the few occasions I've actually met a programmer and talked with them, it is a fantastically rare luxury, and I have learned to try and ask the best questions I can when I have those moments. Most don't want to ""talk about work"".<p>It can be a long (years) slog. In my case I had to figure out enough networking to be given an old CPU in exchange for setting up a router. Then figuring out how to burn and load a SuSE on it (10.3, with a very broken Zypper -- imagine suffering with that as your first distro when you don't even know if it's your fault and don't know anyone who can help). Then I had to figure out enough command line stuff to not be totally lost (and forget huge numbers of one-liners, not sure if they would be useful in the future). Then try about 10 different languages trying to find what works. Oh, did I mention learning Vi and Emacs with nothing but Google?<p>To anyone out there alone in the woods, trying to learn this on their own, I definitely recommend buying Lutz's Learning Python and read what of it you need to while working through Zed Shaw's  Learn Python the Hard Way. And have questions ready in case you ever find yourself sitting next to a professional programmer on a bus in Okinawa.",1315347988

2967480,comment,2967301,2967301,4,0,scott_s,,,"I suppose it's also true that your day-to-day development language may be someone else's glue language. There's probably hardware people who consider C their glue language.<p>I use Python for all of my scripts. The moment that I want to automate some system related task that requires any logic, I reach for Python. (I'd still write a bash ""script"" if the script was just a succession of commands.) I don't think this is a controversial position since Python is considered a cousin of Perl, and Perl was heavily inspired by shell scripts, awk and sed. I think of Perl and TCL as the original glue languages.<p>If I'm writing a script from scratch, I just don't see any compelling reason to do it in bash. (Or whatever your shell of choice is.) Yes, I recognize that ""Python may not be available"" is a potential reason, but it's not compelling to me because it's available in the places I'll need to work.",1315346700
2967479,comment,2966906,2967343,11,0,ansy,,,"I can think of a couple other things Google would want in addition to longer license terms.<p>1) A license to stream for free to any device. No more differentiating between a computer, a set top box, and a mobile device. No more Hulu Plus to use the Android app to watch what you could see from a PC for free. Just like how Time Warner was blocked from streaming TV content to an iPad app, Hulu has restrictions around streaming content to anything but a computer.<p>2) Licenses in international markets. Hulu is primarily in the United States only. Google wants to take all its properties international so it probably wants something in writing up front this will be an option.<p>If Google is asking for anything close to the above it's understandable why it's separated out from the other bidders and why Google felt it needed to throw down serious money to get everyone's attention. Media companies just don't sell broad rights to one buyer because that eliminates most of the bidders and puts the seller at a disadvantage. These kinds of requests go against the very nature of modern content licensing. Everything is supposed to be divided up as much as possible and sold piecemeal to the highest bidder.<p>I suspect there is a problem where different bidders appeal to different owners of the Hulu venture. Some will appeal to the Starz argument and prefer Dish. Some will prefer Amazon, who will probably bid the most under Hulu's terms and already has close ties to Hulu's executive team. Some might entertain Google's bid, although it would have to be ridiculously lucrative. Like Skype, what were they thinking lucrative. Usually Google walks away when someone asks for ""too much."" Whoever prefers Yahoo is a loony. I'd guess Yahoo is only kept in the bidding to keep Amazon and Dish honest.",1315346699

They're not using this witness to decide who is right or wrong, just if there was wrong doing, what would the cost be.  It's like saying that murder is 25 years to life.

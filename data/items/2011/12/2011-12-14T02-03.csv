If you go by Fred Wilson's numbers [1]: $10k per month per engineer, the engineers are probably accepting a $60K/year salary.  That's an enormous pay cut for me at least, and well below market for virtually all engineers.  So certainly the founders are taking very little money, but the engineer may well be making a $4k/mo investment as well...<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/12/burn-rates-how-much.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/12/burn-rates-how-much.html</a>",1323831592

For most programs--particularly text editors--going full screen is basically minimizing.<p>I really like how KDE handles this: by default, full screen is like maximizing and turning off the borders/title bar (the window might also cover the panel on the bottom, but I have that hidden so I don't know). However, programs are free to do whatever they want in full-screen mode; Chrome, for example, treats it just like F11.<p>This lets me have the best of both worlds--if software does something special, it can; if it doesn't, I can still have it full screen, which is especially useful for programs like Emacs (which is its own window manager, really ;)).",1323831588

3350365,comment,3349429,3349429,5,0,jbm,,,"I love generators!  They produce attractive code that is understandable (once one really understands what a generator is)<p>I remember using one when I was building a Mail DB search appliance (on the backburner..) with the mail retrieval code being this:<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/1014045"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/1014045</a><p>Basically, after importing, retrieving emails is as simple as this:<p><pre><code>    get_messages, close_server  = __pop3()
    all_messages = get_messages()
    for message in all_messages:
            fn(message)
    close_server()
</code></pre>
__pop3 returning a simple generator, while close_server deals with shutting off the server / cleaning up the closure itself.  No need to retrieve/initialize all the emails at once (with the memory / other overhead involved); just one at a time (with the connection being kept open in the background).  Normally if you'd want to do that, you'd have to stick the ""message handling code"" into the ""message retrieval code"", or at least pass along a ""handling"" function - neither of which really seems that kosher to me.  Generators solved that problem handily.",1323831293
3350364,comment,3350208,3350208,7,0,chc,,,"This is such a superficial argument  even more superficial than the feature it's criticizing. It's only <i>possibly</i> misleading if you aren't familiar with the syntax, and that's true of a whole boatload of things, such as block syntax. The hashrocket itself looks bizarre and excessively noisy to people coming from JavaScript or Python or pretty much anything but PHP.<p>This really is just, ""I am not used to this syntax, so it looks weird to me."" It's the same argument some people make against calling methods without parentheses in Ruby. If you're the sort of person who writes ""self.houses().map(){|house| house.sale_price()}.sort()"", then I guess at least you're being consistent. If not, don't be that guy.<p>More philosophically, Ruby is a TIMTOWTDI language. There are five different and largely interchangeable ways to create a Proc, half the core library methods are aliases for other methods, several keywords are just slight variations on each other for no purpose other than to give you options, you can take or leave parentheses, etc. The new hash syntax is just one more example of this ethos. If this embarrassment of ways to write any given program bothers you (and you're certainly in good company if it does), you'd probably be more at home with Python. (I don't mean to tell anyone their business, I'm just saying, ""only one way to do it"" is the Python philosophy.)",1323831290

Even if the insurance companies do have that information, your example depends on their being oblivious to the existence of designated drivers. I might, for example, be operating a taxi or limousine service, where my job is to drive drunken people around while they have a good time.<p>I'm all about corner cases, but it does not follow that paranoia is the sensible position to take. I can just as easily suggest corner cases where insurance companies decide to skip the analysis, increase premiums on everyone evenly, and blame inflation, because it considerably lowers their overhead and the administrative savings offset a good deal of the increased payouts, so that the premiums don't rise too much. Unsustainable over any period but the very short term, of course, but many would argue that something very similar happened at AIG in the runup to the financial crisis. Not performing proper diligence on the financial instruments whose risk they were insuring against (via credit default swaps) looked like financial genius until the claims suddenly exceeded the value of the premiums. That's why it's cheaper to pay actuaries than to place your faith in people's common sense.<p>There are different interests to be balanced here, but it seems to me you are complaining about the existence of the scales (ie the court).",1323831166

Even his home situation--mom is a prostitute, but he can't tell anyone lest the authorities separate them--is in all likelihood less common than it might have been centuries ago.<p>So if these conditions are so awful that we can't possibly expect people to improve without fixing said conditions, how do we explain historical economic growth.

At that point I thought, maybe this is a little unhealthy.<p>Honestly, why is that unhealthy? I think there's probably more to this story, but it's not like it doesn't happen in real life without facebook. You hang with your friends, you exchange stories about someone you don't know, and then one day you meet them and someone mentions by the way, this was the person we were talkin about when we said bla bla bla. Yes, facebook probably makes it easier, but I don't find this to be unhealthy in the least.<p>I wasnt calling my friends anymore, said Ashleigh Elser, 24, who is in graduate school in Charlottesville, Va. I was just seeing their pictures and updates and felt like that was really connecting to them.<p>I've heard this before. Honestly, I think it's because we're in this transition stage where somehow this feels less real than a phone call. I would argue that this <i>is</i> a real connection. These pictures and updates often communicate more than you necessarily would remember to in a phone call. The purpose of a phone call is different, the interactions there are different. It seems like if you're worried that you're not calling your friends anymore You should start calling your friends again.<p>I know I feel like I am exposed to more articles and jokes and opinions via facebook than I would if I weren't on it. I interact with people I'm not super-close with, and that's fine. To me, it's like HN, but with a different set of people posting stuff to it, people who are close to my interests in a way completely different from HN. It's more personal in some ways, and I feel more free to be myself in some ways, while I feel more constrained in others. It is, in short, the very definition of a different medium of interaction. I won't say the same things on facebook that I do on HN, and I won't say the same things on either of those that I will with my friends when we're having a drink.<p>I'm not saying people shouldn't be free to shun facebook at all. But I think there are some common complaints about facebook that simply stem from a strange concept of what it is. Then again, I suppose if you're using it in a way that's harmful to you, and you can't figure out how to make it less harmful, it's probably a good idea to leave it altogether.<p>By the way, I probably spend at least 15 hours a week using facebook. That fact doesn't particularly bother me. In the past, I've noticed this goes down when I have other stuff to do. Facebook is just something that happens more often when I have more spare time. If I really wanted to do something different with that time, I would (though there's a decent argument here for death by a thousand papercutsor facebook visits).",1323828793

Add API's like access to the camera and there's even less reasons to develop a native app.
Apps will be relegated to games and highly sophisticated interfaces, which if I had to guess probably represents around 10% of all the apps out there (heck, most of the games out there could probably be done in the browser).",1323828164

Presumably it would have taken significantly longer to write full handling for the vi scripting language. TextMate bundles seem to be more limited, except insofar as they invoke external scripts.<p>I do get what you're saying though. You lose a great deal of existing work because of that. I considered vico a new editor built on the base concept of vim, rather than a total replacement, and in that sense I think it succeeds very well.",1323828132

My point is that the nature of links are not the same. There is no way for a website to pass data back to you and the links are completely static. Generally if the links have url params then they link is generated by some serverside template renderer and its disingenuous to compare just the output from that program to the source from another program.<p>XHR requests are much more of an analog to Intents than <a> links are, and they are a similar order of complexity.",1323828117

I&#x27;ve become comfortable with my whale-like properties and I&#x27;m male, so I had the lovely privilege of learning from this particular resource. It would be great if people not in my position could too.<p>Maybe the author did some research and determined that the added &quot;humor&quot; and &quot;casual attitude&quot; engages more readers than it turns away. I&#x27;d still want to know the demographics of both groups involved, because I suspect one of the groups looks a lot like me and the other does not.",1424321998

Even 30 minutes of walking around will sharpen your focus. 20 minutes on an elliptical will be even better. There&#x27;s ample clinical evidence on how exercise is really helpful with focus and mood.<p>Then, importantly: don&#x27;t just &quot;talk your doctor into giving you ADD drugs&quot;. Go find a good psychiatrist, or at least, a psychiatrist who will give you a proper ADHD assessment and with whom you can work on medication if needed. ADHD assessment takes at least few hours and is far more than just self-reported symptoms and history-based. It typically includes objective attention/executive processing tests and also evaluates you for any other possible conditions.<p>Do you have any anxiety issues? That can very well contribute.<p>Ideally, they would be also able to refer you to a psychologist or coach who would help you figure out what you want and teach you some valuable skills you could use to help yourself. Psychologist can really give you a higher-level picture of what the hell is going on.<p>Basically, go get help. Worst case, you&#x27;ll learn something, and best case, you&#x27;ll learn a lot and be happier and more productive.",1424321995

I think the lost art is &#x27;Variable Sized Structs&#x27;, the emphasis on the last &#x27;s&#x27; of &#x27;Structs&#x27;.<p>This is the situation where your solution calls for an array of structs that are contiguous in memory but aren&#x27;t the same size.  This happens oftenish in database, os, and compression tech.  C99 and gcc have legalized the often used convention:<p><pre><code>  struct varb {\n      char *foo;\n      unsigned char age;\n      int number_of_bars;\n      char var[];  // it&#x27;s something like var[0] in GCC, or var[1] in versions < c99\n  };\n   </code></pre>\nwhere the last element is actually the start of the variable length piece.  In all the C supported implementations of var length structs, we have limitations:<p>- the variable part must be declared last<p>- the struct may not appear in other structs or arrays<p>which totally makes sense, but doesn&#x27;t help us implement a contiguous array of variable length structs.  Also, the restriction of having the variable part of the struct come last may waste a lot of space if we have a structure where we would rather optimize the order of the struct ourselves, but that&#x27;s another post!<p>Assume we are OK with the limitations of our <i>struct varb</i>, we now need to declare and <i>malloc</i> (or <i>mmap</i>) a <i>char</i>* (to hold all of our data) and lay out our <i>varb structs</i> fairly manually.  Once we have found the start of a particular <i>varb struct</i>, we can cast it&#x27;s <i>char</i>* address to a <i>struct varb</i>* and the compiler then can help us populate or interrogate our data.  Note that we will need to keep track of detailed memory usage &#x27;so far&#x27; when we are populating as well track padding, alignment of adjacent <i>structs</i>, as well as any reallocation when our <i>struct</i> array needs to grow.",1424321507

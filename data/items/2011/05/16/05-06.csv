A good place to go for varied programming challenges is <a href=""http://projecteuler.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projecteuler.net/</a>. The problems are generally math-related, but lend themselves nicely to programmed solutions. These help get you familiar with the syntax, and once you've got that out of the way learning the libraries is only a matter of using them.<p>I first learned C# at an internship last summer, and I did it by spending a solid week making a 'music database', basically a toy application that was a GUI front end to a SQL database. I learned how C# interfaced with databases, its threading model, the event system, the go-to data structures, etc. With a bit of time, a non-trivial goal directed towards your area of interest, and access to Google and Stack Overflow, there's little reason to effectively take a course in a programming language.<p>This approach may not be as structured as what you're hoping for, but for me it has been the most practical. I took a course on C++ at my university a year or so ago, programmed some trivial applications for it, passed, and came out with little practical knowledge or understanding of the language.

In fact, many of the lawsuits are against the government, and they get heard. All you need to do is show that you were wronged, and you can sue, and have your day in court. Of course if you open yourself up to criminal prosecution (which could be if legislative outlaws bitcoins, directly or not) then it's best not to pursue that route.<p>But that doesn't matter, government is not the only entity that can resolve conflicts. Online reputation management, trusted third-party processors (escrow), the mob, and insurance companies can all reduce fraud to manageable size.",1305522214

No equity makes you a contractor/consultant (who should receive an above market salary, as they receive no equity or benefits).<p>The options are (pre-series A): large chunk of equity (1-2%), a below market salary. Post-series A: market salary, good amount of equity. Series-B and above: above market rate (you're longer offering a ""life changing"" amount of equity, yet you aren't offering the benefits/bonuses/etc.. that larger corporations can), some equity.<p>If a company is offering something significantly below this (co-founders without equity, salary significant lower than other same-stage companies) they won't be able to hire people who have other options.<p>This sounds just strange: either the co-founders are very inexperienced, or they're deliberately looking for people who can't get _any other job_ (why else would someone take this?)<p>The only exception to this is if you really can't get another job, but want one: if you have no professional programming experience, studying CS isn't an option for you, yet you have the confidence that you'll be able to learn and grow in that position until you're able to get a better job. The founders have to also consciously realize that this is what they're offering you (so that they can serve as a reference when you apply to future jobs).

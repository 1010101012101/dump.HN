1084834,comment,1084150,1084446,0,0,acangiano,,,"> This sounds suspiciously like marketing speak.<p>As some of you here may know, I'm a technical evangelist for IBM. I try to remain factual, but I may occasionally be a tad biased. I disclose my (IBM) affiliation in my profile, but edited my comment and added a disclaimer there as well.<p>> I graduated in 2006, and we never even spoke of DB2 in my time at the University of Michigan.<p>We have a ""DB2 on Campus"" initiative (started in July 2006) [1] that has spread to over 250 universities worldwide so far, with about 30,000 students and teachers participating in the program.<p>> What makes it ideal to startups (any cool examples)? What innovations exist in DB2 that are not available elsewhere?<p>Unlike different ""express"" editions provided by other vendors, DB2 Express-C doesn't impose limits on the size of the database, the number of users that can be connected, and so on. This means that a startup can begin using DB2 Express-C for free, while taking advantage of a fast, secure, rock solid, very scalable database that's already being used by large corporations for mission critical work. If you were to hit the jackpot and become highly successful, DB2 would be able to scale with you from your VPS box all the way to a cluster of instances running in parallel within a huge cloud environment.<p>The free edition will use up to 2 CPU cores, and 2 GB of RAM, regardless of the hardware installed on your server. This is usually plenty, if you consider that many smaller startups don't even have a dedicated database VPS with 2 GB of RAM.<p>For less than three grand a year, you can also obtain 24/7 technical support from IBM as well as the ability to access further features, like the possibility of setting up a fail over server through the so-called ""High Availability and Disaster Recovery"" (HADR) feature. This upgrade also enables DB2 to use 4 CPU cores, and up to 4 GB of RAM.<p>IBM directly implements and supports APIs for various languages, including PHP, Ruby, and more recently Python. When you have an issue with any of those, you have people accountable for, and well paid to solve your problems. If you are wondering, those are open source, too, in case you like doing things DYI style. And we offer advanced tools like IBM Data Studio, free of charge as well. [2]<p>Learning DB2 is fairly straightforward, and there is a great deal of free information. Amongst which you'll find a course that was extracted from the DB2 on Campus program [3] and free ebooks [4].<p>Regarding features, DB2 introduced something called pureXML. This allows you to natively store huge quantities of XML data and query it through SQL/XML, XPath, XQuery. It's amazingly fast. [5]<p>The autonomic features of DB2 are also unmatched, enabling DB2 to self-tune itself, while limiting the amount of work required to administer and optimize DB2.<p>There are also more ""enterprisey"" features like DPF, very advanced compression capabilities, pureQuery, InfoSphere Warehouse powered by DB2, and so on. But these are typically of less interest to early stage startups.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/software/data/db2/express/students_programs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibm.com/software/data/db2/express/students_progra...</a><p>2. <a href=""https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=swg-idssa"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?so...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/display/DB2/DB2+on+Campus+videos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/display/DB2/DB2+on+C...</a><p>4. <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/display/DB2/FREE+Book-+Getting+Started+with+DB2+Express-C"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/display/DB2/FREE+Boo...</a><p>5. <a href=""http://antoniocangiano.com/2008/11/04/benchmarking-db2-purexml-against-1-tb-of-xml-data/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://antoniocangiano.com/2008/11/04/benchmarking-db2-purex...</a>",1264708407

But with the exception of this past year, I've gone to Flash in the Can conferences and loved viewing what the Flash community has developed. There are some really beautiful works of art, proofs of concept, games, and even user interfaces developed in Flash.<p>That said, the only true mass market commercial successes involving Flash are solutions for which equivalent alternatives exist or are very very close to existing. HTML5 solves the video dilemma that Flash was a nice, elegant solution for. In 2004 we were stuck in the quagmire of ""Click here for QuickTime, here for Windows Media, or here for RealPlayer"". It had a nice 5 year run but now an alternative exists.<p>IMHO, Flex is Adobe's last stand. Until recently AJAX user interfaces have been a complete pain to deal with. For the record, I prefer the HTML/CSS/JS approach, but implementing an interface using any of the existing frameworks save for SproutCore or Cappucino is a completely different experience to what Flash/Flex developers are used to. Once frameworks like SproutCore and Cappucino truly get mass market acceptance in the developer community (e.g., probably in 5 years time when MS comes full circle with ASP.NET implementing a sane implementation of web forms only using the MVC approach) I think Flash will die.<p>Apple is correct in the same way they were correct about the death of the floppy disk. They're about 5-7 years ahead of the competition and until then you'll have people complaining about the lack of Flash just the same way you had folks complaining that an iMac didn't ship with a floppy drive in the year 2001 (long after Apple ditched it and long after they were appropriate for sharing files).",1264707050

If they weren't able to do all 5 of these very well, it wouldn't matter how great the devices are. Other companies do the hardware & the software. Some are even pretty good at the marketing. Very few companies do all 5 of these things as well as Apple does and make that a seamless whole.<p>Of these 5, <i>the last two</i> are often the missing secret sauce.  Of these 5, <i>the last one</i> is the most powerful.  They realize this.  Why do you think they do everything that they do with the stores?<p>Open Source shows that you can have nothing but software and ecosystem.",1264705466

I found comfy running shoes worked out best. Of course, I have a slightly abnormal bone structure in my feet that may make my observations invalid. Plus, after a slight tear in my MCL I rarely do anything but the elliptical these days.",1264705427

You can't ever find a place that's nice and peaceful, because there isn't any. You may think there is, but once you get there, when you're not looking, somebody'll sneak up and write “Fuck you” right under your nose. Try it sometime. I think, even, if I ever die, and they stick me in a cemetery, and I have a tombstone and all, it'll say “Holden Caulfield” on it, and then what year I was born and what year I died, and then right under that it'll say “Fuck you.” I'm positive, in fact.</i>",1264705385

Rockefeller did this by taking a nascent and highly localized oil industry (originally only in Pennsylvania and then Ohio) dominated by wildcatters and other independents and transforming it into a highly integrated and even ruthless competitive machine by which he could always beat his competitors on price while serving major emerging new markets. This was <i>not</i> based on any genius he had about the oil products themselves. He was not technically trained concerning such products. What he understood was business and innovation in emerging markets for these products. Hire the best talent. Gain control of the railroads that were vital to ship the products cheaply and efficiently, first by pressuring them through building a system of pipelines that threatened to undercut their business and then by entering into deals with them involving secret rebates so as to incentive them to deal with Rockefeller either alone or on highly preferential terms. Use legal innovations to set up trusts and partnerships that allowed a series of corporations, one in each state, to function as an integrated whole at a time when it was (people forget this) <i>illegal</i> for a corporation to do business across state lines, thereby gaining hegemony in the U.S. oil market that no other competitor could come even close to matching and eventually using this as a springboard for international dominance as well. The result (setting aside the illegalities involved): the building of an empire that grew exponentially in relation to anything else around it owing to its ability to offer quality and cheap pricing to consumers.<p>It is not too far-fetched, I think, to say that Steve Jobs is doing something similar in taking on the wildcatters of today in a quest to win the major markets of the information age. He has so managed to unite amazing product development with tightly integrated and company-dominated distribution channels with ground-breaking arrangements with the telcos (who are the vital connecting links, or ""railroads,"" of our day) as to build a formidable empire that threatens to crush any direct competitors in its field.  The genius is undeniable, even down to having set up retail outlets of a type that everyone would have laughed at just 20 years ago.<p>Who can tell where this quest for hegemony in today's open-systems world will go but the implications are both intriguing and frightening at the same time.",1264705323

7172699,comment,7166207,7172344,1,0,lutusp,,,">> Tell that to the NIMH, which has ruled against use of the DSM for the best of reasons -- the claim is false.<p>> You can keep saying that, but its not going to make it true ...<p>Which part of this are you not getting? I&#x27;m not saying it, the NIMH is saying it. The NIMH has ruled that the DSM can no longer be used as the basis of scientific research proposals because it only lists symptoms, not causes.<p>> ... psychology and psychiatry do address causes ...<p>You need to locate some evidence for this claim. Psychiatry and psychology deal in symptoms, not root causes. Don&#x27;t bother to tell me how wrong you think this is, just write directly to the director of the NIMH, whose recent ruling is based on this uncontroversial fact.<p>In the 1950s, schizophrenia was blamed on refrigerator moms (among other things). Now it&#x27;s thought to have roots in genetics, but no one knows for certain. All that is certain is that <i>its root cause is unknown</i>. I choose schizophrenia for this example because, among the many disorders listed in the DSM, it&#x27;s one of the better-understood. But its actual cause is unknown, as is true for all the other disorders listed there.<p>In his recent book &quot;Book of Woe&quot;, psychoanalyst Gary Greenwood reports that melancholia was proposed for DSM-5 but was turned down because its cause really is known, and the committee members realized this would represent the single exception to the rule that none of the listed conditions include a cause, and this would undermine the editorial scheme. So they voted it out, leaving the new DSM in a pure state -- all symptoms, no causes.<p>I ask that you think a bit more deeply about this. Why did the DSM committees vote disorders into and out of the text? Why didn&#x27;t they instead use scientific results that prove an association between causes and symptoms? The answer is that no such results exist.<p>> ... you keep repeating the same ignorant statements ...<p>Nice argument. Do you have any idea how this makes psychiatry and psychology look? Are you familiar with the term <i>argumentum ad hominem?</i>",1391453922

7172659,comment,7170299,7171034,1,0,VLM,,,"&quot;the subject can appear opaque and irrelevant.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll give it a shot.<p>Let me tell you about an onion.  One interesting CS topic to google for is Chomsky Hierarchy.  You can start out with really simple grammars (rules) and languages (what the rules result in) and advance toward more complicated problems.  Amazingly, for no apparent reason, each step contains everything smaller than the step below plus some set of new things that end up equivalent to each other, even if it takes lots of effort to prove it.  Like layers on an onion.  For example, its mathematically impossible to come up with a math-type regex that can&#x27;t be solved by a NFA and impossible to come up with a NFA that can&#x27;t be solved by a DFA, and all those equivalent regular languages live inside a bigger class of CFLs and PDAs and so on, bigger and more complex every stage you go up.  Its all very complicated and highly developed and pretty much figured out at the lower and mid levels.  Turing machines seem to be the king of the hill at the somewhat mysterious top.  So, thats enough talk about the shape on an onion.<p>Deep in the onion, there exists one terribly complicated set of vaguely equivalent problems that Turing machines can solve, which scale horribly as the size of the problem increases.  And then there is a competing set of problems that scale really easily and are quickly solved.  Inside the families they are all cousins of each other and never marry outside their families, ever.  So if you find a way to quickly solve one NP its been proven you can warp that technique into solving another NP problem, more or less.  But it never, ever, so far, hops between families.  NP problems and P problems just don&#x27;t procreate together, sorta.  Its just like when you slice open an onion and find two independent sprouts that have nothing to do with each other.  Why, I donno.  Nobody knows why.  At least WRT P=NP, donno about the onions.<p>Now its time for idle speculation.  How do these apparently separate families fit in the Chomsky Hierarchy, could there be another separate layer of NP problems above the P problems and a matching layer of NP &quot;machines&quot; vs P &quot;turing machines&quot;?  Is there a layer on top where if you take a turing machine and add magic pixie dust now it can solve NP problems in P time?  If P=NP so this disjoint set of problems is just equivalent Turing solvable problems, how come nobody has proven it yet despite enormous effort and motivation?  How come languages that apparently have nothing to do with each other like REGEX and DFA are mathematically proven the same but nobodies proven it yet for P = NP, doesn&#x27;t that imply its incredibly unlikely they are the same because all the other levels &quot;intermingle&quot; their languages with each other?  How does quantum computing fit in, if it does at all in any way?<p>I tried hard to shove P=NP and the Chomsky hierarchy together, its not going to be insightful to point out that I really swung a sledgehammer to slam this connector into that socket; I already know that.  Also I simplified some stuff (well, OK, I simplified everything).  But its hopefully an entertaining read and not entirely irrelevant and opaque.",1391453605

Rails are positioned such that the balls strike them on their northern hemispheres. Because the rails are a wedge, the ball will get pinched between the rail and the table. To understand this collision, you need to take into consideration the rotational momentum of the ball. This is easier to solve when it is a completely orthogonal collision with no lateral rotations.<p>If the ball strikes the rail on an angle, the rails twist to absorb the impact and will recoil with a force that isn&#x27;t just a simple reflection, but that also has a force vector tangent to the ball and back towards the origin. This directly affects the spin of the ball when it leaves the rail.<p>Combined, a bounce off the rail is a very complicated collision. The net result of which has balls that strike the rail at lower velocities closely matching a reflection, but if struck with a higher velocity, the reflection straightens out into a bounce more perpendicular to the rail.<p>In short, the rails are highly dependent upon the velocities at impact, and perhaps more so than at break, are affected by rotational momentum.",1391452739

Perhaps one of them would know of 53, and probably not by name. Being in the mobile software community, we know of a lot of &quot;successful mobile apps&quot; that are not household names. I like and use 53&#x27;s Paper, but 53 is not Exxon, GE, or Facebook. My friends and family have almost certainly never heard of it. A hundred million unverified global downloads does not equal a hundred million people who remember what your poorly branded, generically named app is called. I usually think of it as &quot;that coffee stain icon with a generic name&quot;. Honestly, 53 might do better renaming it &quot;53&quot;. Or &quot;Studio 53&quot; if they wanted to skim off of another brand that probably won&#x27;t fight back.<p>Paper by FiftyThree is a good product, but a poor choice of name, and I still can&#x27;t figure out why their app icon says &quot;53&quot; instead of &quot;Paper&quot;.<p><i>That said, I don&#x27;t think 53 can claim any exclusive rights to the name, and I&#x27;m happy to see they haven&#x27;t - they have just asked with exquisite politeness.</i><p>No. 53 needs to claim exclusivity, claim that there is no possibility of confusion, or live with the reality that if people start calling Facebook Paper just &quot;Paper&quot;, that Facebook will legally be able to prevent 53 from using the term.

Government solves people&#x27;s problems by giving them benefits that they would not otherwise have, at least not without a lot of work.<p>The situation is like slavery of pre 1860s in the southern United States. Slavery was obviously wrong, but it survived because it &quot;solved problems&quot; for its constituents.<p>In both cases eliminating the injustice would result in making the lives of many of the system&#x27;s beneficiaries worse off. Specifically, in this case, people are willing to accept the rule of evil people like those portrayed in House of Cards because it makes their personal lives more pleasant than it would be otherwise.",1391450891

You are falsely asserting that this is a separate domain, rather than just an area in which results have been incomplete. This is false -- neuroscience is a new <i>name</i> for something that has always been part of the domain of exploration of psychology, and in which important results have been made -- though not broad and deep enough to be widely useful across the field -- for a long time, even before the name &quot;neuroscience&quot; was applied to them.<p>> and the director of the NIMH mentioned the same issue a few months ago as he ruled that the DSM would no longer be accepted as the basis for scientific research proposals, for the simple reason that it has no scientific content<p>The &quot;no scientific content&quot; claim you make is not, in fact, contained anywhere in Director Insel&#x27;s announcement regarding RDoC that you link.<p>A better description of Insel&#x27;s position (and the one that is consistent with his later statement on the relation between DSM and RDoC [1]) would be that RDoC was announced because the tools for the investigation of the physical causes of mental illness have progressed to the point where it seems likely that we can productively move toward a better model of diagnosis with a fresh look unconstrained by symptom-based descriptive categories, which have always (as is the case with syndrome-based diagnoses elsewhere in health where causes are not well-established) been recognized as troublesome but have been the best that the science to date has been able to support.<p>> > his is simply false: psychology and psychiatry do address causes, and even the DSM does in some cases.<p>> Tell that to the NIMH, which has ruled against use of the DSM for the best of reasons -- the claim is false.<p>You can keep saying that, but its not going to make it true; psychology and psychiatry do address causes, as does, in certain cases, the DSM. For instance, the different neurocognitive disorders identified in the DSM-5 are differentiated by causes.

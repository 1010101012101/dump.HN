If you pirate a $10K software suite, you will not be charged with grand theft: software.<p>Theft, by definition, transfers value from the original possessor use to the thief - a zero sum transaction where the thief gains at the owner's loss. Copyright infringement does not do so. It only deprives the original possessor of <i>potential</i> future value. (You could even argue within some legal jurisdictions that there is copyright infringement only when the pirate derives commercial gain from the copy.)",1210960080

Then think about how you enthuse and incentivise your friends and friends of friends to do the same thing at the universities and schools they go to all over the country.  If it's aimed at small businesses, write to or call in at one hundred local small businesess.  It may sound hopelessly inefficient and low-tech, but it will get you your first customers.

If I did that, it says I don't trust anyone, and it would only be wasting effort which is actually costing me something.  It comes down to focusing on preventing piracy or focusing on moving your business forward.  Easy decision there.",1210957829

I know people, small charities and welfare organizations, who need to use computers for work but barely have the money. When they get donations, they spend it on something like feeding the poor rather than buying a copy of Windows.
Its easy to take the moral high-ground...and classify the world in four scenarios - many more exist.",1210957707

191969,comment,191899,191945,0,0,breck,,,"Yes, for a project I'm currently working on. It's targeted toward consumers in a small niche medical community. I Google'd until I found a handful of active forums for this niche. Then I posted to the most active one. I offered a free year's trial to the first beta users. I got 12 from that site. Then after a few days I repeated that process on another forum and got 8 more. I'm working out a lot of bugs but having real users is great. So far they've been active and enthusiastic with feedback. I'm not sure whether this is the right niche for my product, but am improving it a lot with their help. I haven't charged anyone yet(in fact, haven't even setup the payment system yet), and may run into difficulty when I do launch the public product since it seems consumers are very reluctant to pay for things online. But that's why it's great to have beta users from my target market who can help me get the product to a point where it's good enough to charge.",1210957635

Also, it may not mean anything to you, but there's a certain cachet in being the one in your social circle who recommends 'cool' new products.<p>Most people are flattered to be asked for advice, and would like to think that their recommendations show what good taste they have.",1210957441

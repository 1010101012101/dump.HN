Her current thinking on the issue--and she takes lithium herself every day--is that the best-evidenced mood-stabilizing treatments for mood disorders are helpful to patients and increase rather than decrease their ability to contribute useful work product to society. Her co-author, Frederick K. Goodwin, M.D., is still deeply skeptical of some antidepressant medications (e.g., the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) because of their capacity for inducing mania in many bipolar patients.<p>P.S. The illness of game theorist John Nash, the subject of the wonderful book A Beautiful Mind, was almost surely manic-depressive illness rather than schizophrenia. At the time he was diagnosed, American physicians misdiagnosed about 50 percent of cases of manic-depressive illness as schizophrenia, because of the mistaken diagnostic criteria used in Freudian psychiatry. Patients started getting better sooner in America as their diagnosis and treatment improved based on ideas from Europe (Kraepelin's diagnostic categories), Australia (lithium treatment for mood disorders), and America itself (cognitive talk therapy as pioneered by Aaron Beck, a former Freudian who found out that Freudian views of depression were incorrect).<p>There seems to be a seasonal surge of interest in this subject on HN right now.

In the first place, what would happen if someone obtained your (say) GoDaddy's username and password and took over it by changing the owner, A-, and MX-records? (Be it by guessing, stealing, keylogging or what have you.) Would the Internet Archive serve as evidence that you have been the owner all along? If not, is there any additional (possibly in-person) step you can take, aside from being careful with you usernames and passwords.<p>Which brings me to the second issue. I guess that either the Internet receives bad publicity in terms of security or most computing environments are more robust than I would assume. But still, I would have thought that by now there would be, for example, an ultra-secure Live CD specifically designed to do your browsing for key sensitive issues, such as handling A-records.

Good thing he didn't make it.  Please read the article next time.  Here's the relevant quote:<p><pre><code>  [Obsessively tracking type information in dynamic 
  languages] prevents a programmer from realizing the 
  benefits of dynamic typing. It's like buying a new car, 
  but refusing to drive any faster than a bicycle. The car 
  is horrible; you can't get up the mountain trails, and it 
  requires gasoline on top of everything else. Indeed, a 
  car is a pretty lousy excuse for a bicycle! Similarly, 
  dynamically typed languages are pretty lousy excuses for 
  statically typed languages.
</code></pre>
The point the author <i>is</i> making is that some programmers may have been frustrated by dynamic languages because they didn't allow their programs to fail, i.e., with runtime type errors.

850219,comment,849108,849108,0,0,pbhjpbhj,,,"<i>'I mustn't move a light switch on a Saturday', you say, 'Fine, I respect that'. [...] I wouldn't have thought 'Maybe there's somebody from the left wing or somebody from the right wing or somebody who subscribes to this view or the other in economics' when I was making the other points. I just think 'Fine, we have different opinions'. But, the moment I say something that has something to do with somebody's ( [...] irrational) beliefs, then we all become terribly protective and terribly defensive and say 'No, we don't attack that; that's an irrational belief but no, we respect it'. </i><p>In what way is it irrational? I think the author conflates apparent lack of support with irrationality - the reason one shouldn't do the switch is that it is a type of work, it requires effort that would otherwise not be expended, Jewish scripture does not allow work on Saturdays, Rabbi's confirm that this is work. Rabbi's are inspired by God, God created us and inspired scripture and knows what is best.<p>Now we can pick all sorts of holes in that argument on lack of support. But it is a rational argument, it applies known (to the subject) facts in a logical manner to determine the true course to take.<p>You might argue that the premises are wrong, fine, but that doesn't stop the reasoning from being logical - if I tell you I'm wearing a green hat, then I ask you what colour of hat I'm wearing, you say green; but I'm not wearing a hat, that doesn't make you irrational it just makes you wrong.<p>The question of whether God exists is not a scientific question, so a better premise to attack would be that Rabbi's are inspired by God. ""Rabbi's provide bad advice"" might be a good first hypothesis - eventually we see that Rabbi's usually provide good advice, should we take that advice? Seems logical (within this limited discourse). Now that doesn't prove the premise we held true initially but it gives limited support to it and is of itself a good reason for listening to Rabbi's.<p>So, then we might consider why we are protective of the Jews belief that they shouldn't switch the light on Saturday. Well do we have scientific data which somehow shows his premises to be wrong? Financial data is relatively simple - did the pundits shares go up, etc.? I warrant that the reason we protect beliefs that we ourselves consider wrong (or in the authors case irrational (which I think is wrong!)) is because we don't have clear data. We <i>belive</i> they are wrong but can't readily show they are objectively wrong.<p>If one could flip to a ""metaphysical indicators"" page of the newspaper (! assuming we know its true) and look up ""God: God is impersonal and does not require one to abide by any specific framework of laws except the Golden Rule"" then we'd have a certain fact that we could rely on to demonstrate the falsehood of this Jews position.",1254227242

I'm paraphrasing poorly but one of his better points was that there's a certain amount of potential money in CL that at the moment is being spent on the very small social good of totally free listings. But he lamented the fact that it used to be spent on the much greater social good of journalism, which is a waste as people don't really need free listings, but they need good journalism for a healthy democracy:<p><a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/09/podcast-67/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/09/podcast-67/</a><p>They went on to conclude charging on all categories in CL was inevitable to stop the spammers and perhaps they could use the extra revenue to start funding digital journalism.",1254226222

If you get any questions that you think are ""sneaky"", ask why they're asking.",1195181330

80490,comment,80390,80390,0,0,henning,,,"apparently if you take smalltalk or a lisp dialect, cut the performance by an order of magnitude, remove most of the really interesting metaprogramming features (leaving pretty much just a crass <i>eval</i> function), and all of the awesome interactivity and incremental development functionality that make systems like Squeak and SLIME such a joy to use, and finish by making it vaguely line-oriented, you get a language that makes people go gaga.<p>go figure.",1195180468

80486,comment,80178,80178,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Flip a coin.<p>It doesn't have to be a balanced coin: I like Ruby, so my coin was biased toward Rails. Ergo, I learned Rails, and will probably go on to play with Merb and Camping.<p>Meanwhile, very smart people assure me that Python is nice, and I hope to learn it before I die.<p>The important thing is to just get moving. Deciding between Rails and, say, Drupal is complicated, with lots of technical, marketing, and business factors in play. But RoR, Django, and the gang are so much alike that the decision comes down to that simple coin flip.<p>",1195180024

You're imparting information in the readers of your comments that has no other purpose than to serve your ego. When I read a comment, I only look at who wrote it when the comment is something special. But you force me to know that John wrote it. Why? Do you think you deserve a special place in my (and everyone else's) mind?<p>But that would be fine, if you didn't try to pass off your personality defect as an ideology for everyone to follow, as you did in this thread. That was what sent me over the edge.",1195178938

5141064,story,,,1,2,xackpot,"Show HN: Interest Groups Around Places",,"Hi Guys, I have recently released an iphone app (old app but pivoted to a different idea). The app has a limited set of features and also limited feature set website (http://www.findero.us), but would like to test it out if users like the idea. The idea is to fulfill the need to create your own location specific interest groups. You can create your open/closed groups around a location or join other such groups. The app is available for download at: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/finderous/id520384764?mt=8<p>The app can be easily used for the following cases:<p>1. Weekend cycling group.<p>2. Residential community group.<p>3. Local Gym group.<p>4. Car pool group.<p>and many more such groups.<p>I would appreciate some feedback.<p>Thanks",1359572379

If you use it as a shared library (er, DLL in this case I guess) you get that for free.  But if, for example, you want to link a LGPL library statically you need to provide a static library containing the rest of your program in a linkable form.<p>The point is to allow the user the ability to exercise their right to modify the LGPL library and use it.

What can we do <i>but</i> discuss it, at this point - no proper analysis can be made, only one based on conjecture and experience.<p>Isn't it clear by this point that Boeing have a problem?  Its either a) an engineering problem, b) a management problem, or c) a combination of both.<p>Its not unreasonable to expect that a company with as much money, and - frankly - unwarranted guaranteed income from the people of the United States of America - to get its act together - and certainly, the means by which it gets it act together is of high interest to the average denizen of hacker news ..<p>So, why call for people to 'not discuss it unless they are experts', then?  There are many lessons to be learned here, and we can certainly use our intelligence - the intelligence of the whole - to make a social comment on the issues revolving around Boeing, and in fact the entire military-industrial machine.  It has its frailties, obviously - and we are seeing them - so isn't this of High Interest to the hacker news community?<p>Calling for an 'authority' to comment on this issue is hardly a way to gain more insight into the problems of technology in this industry. The 'authority' has already been consulted; and clearly, somewhere along the line, screwed things up completely.  The 787 grounding is costing Boeing, its partners, and the American people - a <i>lot</i> of money.<p>Discussing why this happens, how it happens, and what can be done about it, is a very topical use of hacker news, in the first place: so why call for silence-unless-authorized unless there is some desire to reduce the noise from the rabble?  The rabble aren't doing any harm; whereas the likelihood that the management personnel of Boeing <i>are</i> doing harm.  Only by discussing this can we gain any real insight into just how that can occur.<p>Clearly, the engineering is at fault: there is a fault.  Is this management, is it engineering, or is it just plain hard science involved - unless we discuss this situation, openly and with a free will to apply to the investigation, there is nothing much to be gained from the incident in a public setting.<p>I certainly hope they get the problem sorted.  The means by which they do that, is of high interest to me.  I hope to fly on a 787 one day, and know that my safety is a result of real solutions and not a faulty process being forced on engineering by management under constraint of financial market performance duress..<p>>>Here you have an engineer (me) saying: ""We don't know enough. We need facts before we can reach a conclusion. Please stop.""<p>Here you have an entrepreneur saying: ""We don't know enough.  We need to know more.  No conclusions are being made, but the process of discussion sure is interesting - it reveals a lot about human nature when billion-dollar budgets - and human lives - are at risk.  Please continue to discuss this issue as a community.""",1359572248

E.g. you are eventually aiming at completing some big thing, and in reaching it you could make use of such-and-such services which a lot of people also would pay for.<p>Second way (now I think it's just a variation of the above one): use your <i>career</i> as a <i>carrier</i> that carries you to your goal. E.g. use your job to accumulate wealth to finance your work later and as a learning experience (you don't want to fail your beloved project, better fail 'with the cats' and be prepared).<p>Frankly, I have some experience strictly following these advice in personal relationships, the result is weird (unfinished story yet), so use at your own risk :) But in getting satisfaction from work, they do work.",1359572192

He now has to either compromise <i>two</i> sites in order to inject a malicious gem, or trick you into obtaining the public_key from a forged location.<p>I hope 'bundler' and 'gem' hear the wakeup-call and will start displaying a visible warning on unsigned gems (please also print the homepage-url to make it less of a pain for the user to hunt down the public key). After a grace period the default should be switched to -P HighSecurity (reject unsigned gems).<p>Yes, it's is not perfect, users may still import keys without thoroughly checking that the source is legit.

5140860,comment,5137641,5138744,3,0,to_jon,,,"Elon's comments have some validity, but there is a bit of grandstanding going on. Thermal runaway with lion batteries isn't a random event. It's very predictable and very preventable. 99% of lion batteries in use have a built in thermosensor so that they can charge correctly without exploding---because any lion battery will explode if charged too fast or if it goes into overvoltage.<p>So since all of the variables to prevent thermal runaway are know, it should make no difference how closely together they are placed. However in this case there is either a problem with the charging software---which isn't adequately performing and preventing the condition that is causing the batteries to overheat OR the batteries themselves (although in good working order) are not performing within the correct performance envelope that the software has been developed to use.<p>Screaming that placing the cells too close together is bogus. You laptop has cells placed equally close together as do all Tesla vehicles---and they can burn and explode just like the ones on the 787---yet that is a very rare occurrence. Because all of the charging parameters are known. Same applies to the Boeing batteries, but something is not performing according to plan.<p>In space, the parameters are completely different. Fire is the absolute worst case scenario in space and everything that can be done to mitigate the chance of one will be taken. Which is why the batteries on the SpaceX vehicles are spaced out they way they are. Yes, they know all of the parameters for the batteries, but the logistics of changing a battery in space are much different than those of an aircraft.<p>Boeing's fault in all of this is that something is not performing according to spec---and they knew that due to all of the battery swaps the Japanese airlines were doing. At that point they should have grounded and figured out the problem. But past Elon, others have already stepped up and criticized Boeings move to lions in the first place. Nickel cadmium batteries would have weighed 40 pounds more and have barely 1/1000th of a chance of thermal runaway that lithium ion batteries do. They don't charge as fast, but they are still well within the performance envelope needed by the 787.",1359569865

5140829,comment,5138626,5139947,1,0,ollysb,,,"Hey, just been playing with it, looks very interesting. This looks like a good start, I think there's a long way to go with it but it's definitely headed in the right direction. Here's some feedback:<p>1) Maybe start with the design page, I want a blank canvas I can add things to straight away. I realise that you've gone with organising the content first but I can't imagine a designer starting to build a page this way. Following on from this it would be great to be able new content into the design view.<p>2) The black button to show the tools only appears if you click on the left end of the button, this confused me for a while(I kept clicking all over it until it appeared).<p>3) The grid - I think you need to lean on this far more. Have it on display from that start and then use the grid to actually generate the markup (rather than it just being a visual guide). I found that things jumped around a lot when I was dragging/dropping(actually on the drop). This would work well at least for horizontal positioning/alignment.<p>4) Snapping - I really missed this from illustrator, when you're dragging/resizing it should snap to align with other objects on the page.<p>5) When you resize the page the tool area remain the same size, currently the left edge is left in the same place and tool area resizes.<p>6) The generated markup looks pretty decent, after trying Muse and seeing the abomination that generated this was very good to see.<p>7) Colour picker - took a couple of seconds to grok it but actually I really liked it. Being able to adjust in several different ways feels very natural i.e. maybe a bit darker, I want a red, maybe a bit more saturated... very nice! One bug though which was incredibly confusing is that you can't adjust the color of the layer until after you've clicked on one the color blocks above the pallet i.e. if you click on the layer color picker icon and adjust the sliders nothing happens. They only work after you've first clicked on one of the colors at the top.<p>8) Might be nice to give an indication of the boundary for the selected box.<p>9) Layers - found this a little bit confusing for some reason, I could see lots of things in there but couldn't find them anywhere on the actual design. Clicking on something in here should make it visible on screen i.e. scroll to it, select it. BTW they dropped off the bottom of the page a bit so I couldn't see them all clearly.<p>10) Units - seemed a bit strange defining borders and padding in ems, couldn't find any way to use pixels.<p>This looks a great effort and I hope you continue to develop it as there's definitely a market for something like this. I think you need to do a ton of user experience testing to get it more usable. Get some designers to try and build something in it while you're watching. Keep doing this until they find it easy and you're going to have a very popular app on your hands.<p>Hope the feedback is useful(didn't have time to reduce if I'm afraid), feel free to email if you want to talk about it.",1359569576

PhD programs have atrociously high attrition rates and extremely long completion times compared to the professions, and MS programs are often a neglected stepchild.  Employment prospects according to a RAND study[1] are surprisingly bad for such a challenging career path.<p>Americans are already shunning these programs, and I think this is a good thing to the extent that it will force the PhD programs to adapt and become more attractive (perhaps by following a professional school model, with far lower attrition rates and much more predictable and shorter completion times).<p>The problem is, PhD programs benefit enormously from the low cost labor of graduate students, and they don't want to adapt.  One way they've avoided adapting is by tapping into international students who need their degree to gain admission into the United States.  People who already have US residency may not bother, but people who don't have it yet will put up with all kinds of crap.<p>It's a strange situation.

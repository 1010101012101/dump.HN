No one is getting flunked for writing 5,999 words. The idea is to force students to take courses that require a lot of writing.<p>The rule is actually not a terrible idea in the first place. Its basically a response to a larger than you'd expect number of florida university graduates not being able to pass the CLAST (a re-hashing of the SAT). There's a similar requirement that all students must take a certain number of math classses.",1215478541

In fact, I'm having trouble thinking of highly successful people who have never been in either category.<p>How are you going to take the necessary business risks to be the next Bill Gates or Richard Branson or Steve Jobs (or U.S. President or genre-creating musician or ...), if you can't take a small personal risk?  There may be a benefit to ""staying clean"", but it appears to be dwarfed by the ability to take calculated risks.<p>If you want to abstain for the sake of abstention and staying out of jail, then by all means do so.

Most instructors are reasonable enough to know that high quality work does not need to meet arbitrary constraints.</i><p>That works great in cases where the instructors are allowed to think for themselves, not so well otherwise.  In Florida we had this law called the Gordon Rule which states that all students are required to write 24,000 words worth of essay text over the course of their college education.  They don't literally track how many words students write on an individual basis, but rather designate certain courses as 2,000, 4,000, or 6,000 word courses.  Professors are then held strictly accountable for truth-in-advertising.  They're required to check every student's word-count, and to flunk any student who goes one word under the quota.",1215477752

This sort of thing is rarely about whether or not they ""can"" reproduce the technology, but how much value it would be for them to have versus the opportunity costs of working on it.<p>Right now, Twitter is flush with cash from their recent funding. They need to continue their growth and their best engineers are obviously working to keep the site alive rather than designing new features.<p>As such, it makes lots of sense to add features through acquisition given their circumstances. This particular feature has been tried and tested to work with their existing infrastructure. Because it builds on their API, they also don't have to worry about the design breaking during their internal scalability refactoring.<p>This deal makes lots of sense to me and I would expect to see more of this from them as they fight to keep aloft.",1215476843

The only people I could think of who I would consider ostracized in school were those who were incredibly annoying or awkward to be around, i.e. it was a matter of social skills, not being smart. I do realize I went to an atypical high school, but if you're socially incompetent, you may not recognize that your social problems arise from your social incompetence.

They don't ""make up"" for below-market wages.<p>2) Options are time-delayed bonuses that provide incentives for your early employees to stick around.<p>If you try to economize by offering piddling option grants that vest over a long period of time, you're just defeating their purpose as an incentive.  Moreover, a <i>rational</i> employee isn't going to accept or reject your offer based on the option grant alone; they'll decide if they like the rest of the offer/company/work first, then treat the options grant as a  hypothetical <i>bonus</i> for taking the risk of working for an tiny company that will probably fail very quickly anyway.<p>My advice is to offer your first engineer enough to give them a reasonable shot of becoming a millionaire in the event of a $50M exit (so, at least 2%).",1215475633

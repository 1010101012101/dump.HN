The point is that everyone would say the below things would NEVER happen on an airplane, yet, they happened.<p><a href=""http://www.planecrashinfo.com/unusual.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.planecrashinfo.com/unusual.htm</a><p>Some highlights:<p>&quot;A passenger brought aboard a crocodile hidden in a sports bag. The crocodile escaped, causing a panic among passengers who all rushed to one end of the plane. This caused an imbalance in the aircraft which led to loss of control and a crash.&quot;<p>&quot;A stray bullet from training soldiers struck the landing plane, hitting an oxygen cylinder. A fire broke out and control of the plane was lost and it crashed.&quot;<p>&quot;The aircraft was hijacked shortly after taking off from Ethiopia by three drunken escaped prisoners. They demanded to be flown to Australia, but wouldn&#x27;t let the pilot stop to refuel. The plane eventually ran out of fuel and ditched 500 feet offshore killing 127 of 157 aboard.&quot;<p>&quot;A passenger&#x27;s cigarette caused a fire in the cabin which led to an oxygen tank exploding. The plane crashed killing 25 of 69 aboard.&quot;<p>&quot;Two passengers were sucked out of the plane after a tire exploded in the wheel well causing damage to the fuselage.&quot;<p>&quot;Out of boredom, the captain and flight engineer decided to experiment and see what would happen to the autothrottle system if the circuit breakers which supplied power to the instruments which measured the rotational speed of each engine&#x27;s low pressure compressor were tripped. This led to engine overspeeding and destruction of the engine. Pieces struck the fuselage, breaking a window, causing rapid explosive decompression and a passenger was sucked out of the plane. The plane landed safely.&quot;<p>&quot;An unrestrained German Shepard interfered with flight controls and caused the plane to crash.&quot;<p>&quot;Without authorization, the pilot taxied half-way down the runway to try and clear fog. Braking done during the fog clearing overheated the brakes. Soon after takeoff, the overheated brakes caused a tire to burst which damaged a fuel line and started a fire. The plane crashed shortly after killing all 80 people aboard.&quot;<p>These below happened like 50+ years ago.<p>&quot;A U.S. Army Air Force B-25 crashed into the 79th floor of the Empire State Building in fog, killing 3 aboard and 11 on the ground.&quot;<p>&quot;Carbon dioxide extinguishers were discharged in response to a fire warning in the cargo hold. The plane&#x27;s nose was lowered for an emergency descent and due to a design flaw, carbon dioxide entered the cockpit and rendered the crew unconscious after which the plane crashed killing all 43 aboard.  &quot;<p>&quot;The DC-3 disintegrated in flight outside of Quebec killing all 23 aboard.. A dynamite  bomb was planted in the forward baggage compartment by Albert Guay, a jeweler, in a plot to kill his wife who was a passenger on the plane. Guay, who assembled the bomb, had his accomplice, Marguerite Pitre air expressed the bomb on the aircraft. Ms. Pitre&#x27;s brother, a clockmaker, helped make the timing mechanism. The insurance policy was for 10,000 dollars. All three were hanged for their crimes. &quot;<p>&quot;The plane landed in Pacific Ocean, 2.5 mile short of the runway in the shallow waters of San Francisco Bay. All 107 people aboard were safely evacuated off the plane. The aircraft was recovered from the San Francisco Bay 55 hours after the accident, repaired and eventually flew back home to Japan and was in service for many decades.&quot;<p>&quot;The aircraft crashed killing 61 of 82 aboard after colliding with a balloon.&quot;",1394877156

A few bits of constructive criticism, based on my own experiences with making platformers in GameMaker:<p>- you need to fix the gravity so it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s on the moon. I used to get the gravity wrong as well, but it makes for so much more fun and snappy gameplay when you get it right (or actually, a bit <i>more</i> right, cause nobody really jumps that high anyway).<p>- assuming your game logic goes a little something like, if the player is standing on something solid, they can jump: instead doing that, give the player a few frames (3-5) of leeway while they still can jump even though they just walked off a platform ledge. it&#x27;s a very subtle thing, and if you don&#x27;t pay attention you won&#x27;t see that most platformers do this, but it makes all the difference in gameplay (if the player feels like they would have totally made that jump, but drop off the ledge instead, it feels like their character just stumbled or something).<p>the last one is also based on one of the golden rules of gameplay: try to make the game behave as the player wants, which is <i>not</i> always necessarily exactly how the controls are input.<p>(the following stuff is not really critique of your game but some things to keep in mind as you continue)<p>similar tricks involve making the hitboxes of &quot;good&quot; objects larger than they actually are, and the hitboxes of &quot;bad&quot; objects smaller (player thinks: &quot;phew! cool! I <i>barely</i> missed that enemy!!&quot;). btw Flappy Bird subverts this rule, which makes part of its interesting frustratingness, but as always you gotta know the rules before you break the rules.<p>and remember, you can always make your <i>levels</i> harder, if you think such tricks make it too easy on the player. you&#x27;ll find that in such cases &quot;harder&quot; translates to &quot;challenging&quot; instead of &quot;frustrating&quot;.<p>good luck!",1394875340

What&#x27;s relevant is the <i>opportunity cost</i>. If you spent that time (likely hundred or thousands of hours) working on more valuable skills, you&#x27;d likely get much more than 2%. Put another way, the value of that time, when compounded over 20 years, is enormous, probably more enormous than $60k. To compound the value gained from language but not compound the value of the time is extremely misleading - either use present values for both, or use comparable future values for both.",1394875131

It&#x27;s a complex process made of many different intellectual and cultural enhancements that help you get the world in a better perspective, and in the end gives you an unquantifiable advantage over the mono-lingual.<p>Apart from that, I agree that Spanish may not be the better choice in the US, since the position of superiority the non-Latin still has when it come to fluency for professional purposes.\nEven for the Romans it made no sense to learn the language of the inferior populations they had around them, and you&#x27;ll know how it went down. Learning Saxon languages certainly had a bad ROI back then.<p>Furthermore, if you really had to follow this skewed line of ROI-based reasoning, where the hell is Chinese?

Not many.<p>Well, there is more to a language than just words and grammar, right? Learning a language is also a crash course in terms of cultural studies. If you happen to be in contact with other cultures this might be quite helpful to deal with colleagues and/or customers.<p>We&#x27;re living in a world where a majority of people communicate. Cultural understanding is more important than ever and even though English seems to be the global language, everyone should be willing to learn at least one foreign languages and basic concepts of other cultures with it.<p>There&#x27;s also a small test about this: if you happen to be in a foreign country just try to learn the local phrases for &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;Thank you&quot;. Use it when checking in at the hotel, eating in restaurants and dealing with local people - you&#x27;ll be amazed what those simple words can archive. It&#x27;s a sign of respect and that you made an effort to learn about their culture.<p>To sum it up: cultural understanding is getting more important as the whole world (regardless of national borders) communicates. Learning a language comes with learning about a different culture and reflecting your own. This is an essential thing when dealing with foreign people and everybody should have basic knowledge about it.",1394874749

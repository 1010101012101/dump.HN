5817090,comment,5806970,5817023,1,0,Peaker,,,"> Oh we never considered the intersection of these 3 different business use cases<p>Take a look at the history of any repository near you, for a project that uses C, Python or Java.<p>Review bug fix commits. See how many of them relate to ""business use cases"" and how many relate to implementation bugs.  I believe you'll find the latter is far more common.<p>Even in the ""business use cases"", enforced invariants will be a tramendous help. In the infinite possibilities of all the use cases, none will be able to break any invariant forced by the type system.<p>When you set out to <i>prove</i> a property of your program, you will end up finding bugs, almost regardless of what properties you are trying to prove.<p>Writing unit tests is also useful. But if I can have 10 lines in my Red Black Tree that mean I don't have to write <i>any test whatsoever</i> for the tree's invariants -- I saved myself from a whole lot of work writing and later maintaining tests with every change.<p>Generally, to get similar confidence levels from unit tests as you get from types, you'll need to write many more tests. If I had to choose whether to trust a well-typed system written in Agda (which is similar to Haskell but has an even more powerful type system) with only the most trivial testing done, or trust a highly tested system written in dynamic or a much weaker type system, I'd definitely trust Agda more.<p>Or if I were to trust my 10 lines of type code or hundreds of lines of tests for the invariants of the tree, of course the 10 lines of code are far more reliable and easier to maintain.",1370307471

That Japan minimizes its war crimes (as other countries do) and engages in propaganda (as other countries do) does not render irrelevant what Japanese scholars have to say about how and why Japan surrendered in 1945.

But yes, clearly we're waiting; apparently Guido also wants to take a stab at the async batteries, which could help or hurt, if the Twisted contributors think they will be affected.<p>To the point of the comment you first responded to, there is lot of issues not being ""solved"" with respect to network libs, their upgrading to Py3, and Py3 looking to step into that arena. In other words, there is no horizon for networking libs updating, and they may feel even less motivated if the Py3 crowd is saying, ""don't worry about it, because we are going to standardize our way.""

It is stating - categorically - that the commonly accepted narrative is based on an insufficient accounting of the facts, and that this narrative is unsustainable in the face of a more complete record of what actually happened.<p>Here's the key passage:<p>""It didn't take a military genius to see that, while it might be possible to fight a decisive battle against one great power invading from one direction, it would not be possible to fight off two great powers attacking from two different directions. The Soviet invasion invalidated the military's decisive battle strategy, just as it invalidated the diplomatic strategy. At a single stroke, all of Japan's options evaporated. The Soviet invasion [of Manchuria] was strategically decisive -- it foreclosed both of Japan's options -- while the bombing of Hiroshima (which foreclosed neither) was not.""<p>Again, that's not ""speculative"" or ""pseudo-historical"" writing. And there's no way an attentive reader of good will could characterize it as such. Now, you may dispute the veracity of the facts. Or you could bring additional facts to bear. And you may reasonably disagree with the writer's conclusions. But for a guy who is ostensibly adverse to arguments that ""smell of a political agenda and manipulation"", you do yourself no favors by (a) seriously misrepresenting the basic nature of what's being said, and (b) responding to your straw man in the most inappropriately condescending manner possible. (Seriously, lumping this in with UFO conspiracies, as though the Soviet military were what? A figment of unreliable imagination?)<p>If you want to see some real slimeball rhetoric, sir, look no further than your own remarks.

5817081,comment,5816316,5816316,12,0,saraid216,,,"For public speaking, I have a theory of what ""confidence"" is. It's pretty simple: confidence is <i>actually knowing</i> what you're about to do. Public speaking is scary because there are so many things that people haven't accounted for.<p>1. Know your subject. This is usually the easy one. Know exactly how you came to your conclusions, and why it's valid. You can defend the hell out of it if you need to, and you can honestly engage with useful criticism.<p>2. Know what you're going to say. This comes from practice. Are you worried about time? Practice and time yourself. Are you worried about how you look? Practice and video it and watch it. Are you worried about sounding stupid? Practice and record and listen to it. Get someone else to listen to it.<p>3. Know your audience. This is the hardest one. It comes from experience. What does your audience care about? How can you move your audience from where they are to where you want them to be? Get to know them. Become familiar with who they are. This is why talking with your friends is easy, but an auditorium of strangers is scary. This is also why making eye contact with different audience members is helpful. You need to respect your audience, and also believe that your audience respects you.<p>This was a bit of a brain dump (my best write-up has been lost to /dev/null, unfortunately), but hopefully you get the idea. I suspect this would serve as a good core to learning public speaking, though.",1370307401

In a large software organization, so much comes down to not just the company and the problems but the exact team you're on that removing a lot of that uncertainty and working on a team with/for people close in your social graph is great.<p>But strongly biasing your hiring search toward people close in the social graph is a terrible idea. First of all, you're artificially limiting the pool of ""ideal candidates"" dramatically. Second of all, if most people you hire are friends of friends, you're likely not to build a very diverse company. Your culture will get skewed toward things that you and your friends care about and are interested in, and pretty soon there will be large groups of people who don't feel that they especially fit in at your company because eg. they're not male, they have kids, they don't drink, they don't watch sports, they read philosophy, they don't find working >40 hours/week productive or enjoyable.<p>This is a problem in many Silicon Valley startups that leads me, despite being demographically indistinguishable from what these companies overindex on (young, male, white, straight, elite education), not to want to work at most Valley startups.  I deeply admire that Thomas cares about making a company that avoids these problems, which is a large reason why I'm working for Matasano this summer instead of one of the many Valley companies that would feed me three meals a day and in many cases would have a better-known brand.",1370307148

Within a couple of weeks of the video I linked above, he had water and multiplayer working[1]. Nevertheless, it still took another 2.5 years to get to a 1.0 product, and Mojang is still hacking away at it. Skycraft, on the other hand, doesn't appear to have changed at all since it was last featured on HN[1] two weeks ago.<p>I don't mean to be a negative Nancy about it: I think it's great to mess around with this stuff and if playing around with a basic Minecraft/Lego-esque builder scratches a gamedev itch for you, that's awesome.<p>But it seems really premature to start asking for money for it[2], even as a ""Kickstarter""-type pledge drive: I'm not sure I'd even consider this a MVP or proof-of-concept yet. Skycraft today is, relatively speaking, the easy part, and really more of a technical demo: there's no game here yet.<p>Best of luck to the developer, though: I'd love to see if they stick with it and make something really cool. The other ones I've seen all seem to die off shortly after being featured.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEAHqgZU-0o"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEAHqgZU-0o</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5738984"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5738984</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://skycraft.io/#buy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skycraft.io/#buy</a>",1370306544

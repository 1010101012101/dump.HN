Isn't part of the strength of node.js and socket.io that things like push-based client/server apps are/should be trivial to implement without resorting to a third party service? If so, did you try? And do you know if other node knockout apps use pusher?

They work extra hard to make sure people who give them money are happy to do it. In their call centers, CSRs are friendly and empowered. They're instructed to err on the side of doing things that are most likely to make a customer happy, instead of pissing people off with stupid ""it's policy!"" behavior. In their distribution centers, they have a hardcore quality control culture that goes to great lengths to ensure that mailed out DVD's correctly match a customer's order.<p>Contrast this with their dying competition, who never once gave a damn about customer satisfaction. Who, indeed, codified policies whose direct result was to enrage customers.<p>As for ambition, Netflix has continually worked hard to make the service the very best it could be, opening more and more distribution centers to minimize the wait between returning and receiving your DVDs. Despite having every reason to rest on their laurels, they decided they'd also be the Netflix to their Blockbuster, going deep on the Watch Instantly strategy that's redefining their business. Instead of waiting for someone else to come along and make them obsolete, Netflix grabbed the bull by the horns.<p>This is one of the rare moments of modern capitalism producing something truly excellent, on its merits, based on the needs of the market.

2.  Older/Less popular items are poorly seeded, meaning I potentially have to wait overnight for the download to finish.  (A new episode of a current series, however, usually comes in as fast as my broadband connection can handle).
3. Unless you know all of the release groups by heart, you have to spend a minute or two sifting through search results to find a release in a usable format in good-enough quality.  Often I have to settle for something that plays fine in mplayer/vlc instead of something I can stream to my PS3 connected to my TV.
4.

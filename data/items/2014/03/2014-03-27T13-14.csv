You might be able to replicate a universe and wait for intelligence to evolve, but you still wouldn&#x27;t understand the intelligence you had created.<p>The danger of the hardware/software analogy is that we deliberately separated computer systems into (mostly) well-defined and cleanly separated layers. Given how hard it is to avoid leaky abstractions in computer systems that are: (a) vastly less complex than human intelligence and (b) designed to be layered, the systems responsible for human intelligence probably don&#x27;t expose the clean API required for us to understand them using high-level concepts.",1395926744
7480196,comment,7479478,7479478,31,0,jofer,,,"What&#x27;s interesting is that everyone&#x27;s very aware of the seismic hazard along the San Andreas, but many people aren&#x27;t aware of the much larger (but much less frequent) hazard in the Seattle/Portland area.<p>The San Andreas is a strike-slip system.  It&#x27;s not capable of generating very large (magnitude 8 or greater) earthquakes.<p>The Cascadia subduction zone has had magnitude 9 earthquakes in the past. The last one was on Jan. 26th, 1700.  (Thank Japan for having excellent historical records of earthquakes and tsunamis. We know a large earthquake occurred around 300 years ago in the area, and thanks to Japan&#x27;s record of the tsunami it caused, we can make a solid link to the exact date.)<p>We don&#x27;t know the statistical hazard as well due to the small sample size, but when the next large Cascadia earthquake occurs the damage will be absolutely catastrophic.<p>It&#x27;s not just the direct earthquake damage, but also the tsunami hazard.  You need vertical offset to cause a tsunami. A strike-slip system like the San Andreas is very unlikely to cause a tsunami.  The permanent offset is dominantly horizontal, so the only way to generate a tsunami is through secondary effects such as landslides. (Also, most of the length of the San Andreas is onshore.)<p>Subduction zones are thrust systems.  One plate moves up, and the other moves down.  Earthquakes there are likely to produce permanent vertical deformation at the surface.<p>Furthermore, certain types of subduction zones are more prone to generating large tsunamis.  A deep earthquake is unlikely to cause much deformation at the seafloor, and therefore doesn&#x27;t generate as large of a tsunami.  However, the shallower the rupture penetrates, the larger the deformation at the seafloor is, and therefore the larger the tsunami is.  Certain types of subduction zones are more prone to having large earthquakes that rupture all the way up to the seafloor.  (The amount of sediment on top of the incoming oceanic plate is thought to play a large role in this, among other things. The recent Tonankai earthquake in northern Japan turned a lot of what we thought we knew about this on its head, though.)<p>The Cascadia subduction zone is one of the end-member types that&#x27;s likely to have both large earthquakes and large tsunamis.  We know it has in the past, and it&#x27;s likely to in the future.  It&#x27;s unusual in that most of the deformation along the fault occurs through periodic creep (&quot;slow-slip events&quot;) that doesn&#x27;t cause an earthquake.  (Actually, as we&#x27;re finding out, it&#x27;s not that unusual around the world, but it was first observed and is best documented in Cascadia.)  However, while this creep does relieve a significant portion of the accumulated elastic strain, it doesn&#x27;t relieve all of it.  The plate boundary fault is still accumulating elastic strain that will eventually be released in a large earthquake.<p>At any rate, just something to think about.  The seismic hazard in the Bay Area can be reduced through proper engineering solutions. (Though SOMA is going to be in very rough shape for the reasons this article mentions. Lesson for next time: Don&#x27;t bulldoze all the rubble into a pile and then build on top of it!)<p>For Cascadia, though, you can&#x27;t engineer your way around a magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami.  You do the best you can, and try to avoid putting critical infrastructure near the coast.",1395926733

I conjecture that it was originally yellow for visibility reason, then turned red for better contrast with yellow used for caution signs. A full analysis would need to dig into the reasoning for this decision.<p>A more complete analysis would need to look into how color was used in the 1800s, before driving culture appeared. For example, was red the predominate color of danger in steam engines? (Note also that in Swedish and Finnish cultures, Falu red/punamulta is associated with an idyllic country-side life. These houses are not considered &quot;dangerous&quot; despite being red.)<p>The first and third literature references I gave are not in opposition to the idea that red has a (near) universal meaning. They instead cast doubt on the conjecture that the associations are evolutionary. The first suggests that even the observed psychological effects might be culturally learned, and the third suggests that we have a rather wide-spread global culture, making it hard to determine what is cultural and what is evolutionary.<p>Stop signs are also nearly universally octagon in shape. I very much doubt there&#x27;s any sort of evolutionary reason for this choice.<p>My challenge was for the OP to defend the statement that the choice of red = blood = danger = stop is based on evolutionary reasons, with scientific research to back it up. The paper I quoted show that there&#x27;s very little research which can distinguish between a shared culture (and yes, China and the US have a shared culture) and evolutionary universalism.<p>One need only read <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_c...</a> to see that even the basic color terms across cultures, and the evolution of color terms, is still being debated. It would be hard to ask someone &quot;is red a dangerous color&quot; if that someone doesn&#x27;t distinguish between red and yellow.",1395926321

7480137,comment,7479588,7479817,5,0,aestra,,,">apart from their stupidity<p>That&#x27;s harsh. The average consumer doesn&#x27;t have the time/expertise to go through scientific research on homeopathic medicine. Someone tells them &quot;this is going to work&quot; and they believe them.  It might be sad, but not all humans are skeptical nor to they have the time or energy to invest in research. They may not even be aware they are buying homeopathic medicine. Homeopathic medicine is sold near the real medicine, once I picked up a pill bottle on the shelf (while buying another thing) because it caught my eye. I was like &quot;I didn&#x27;t know they could treat this.&quot; I turned it over to read the ingredients and that&#x27;s when I noticed it was homeopathy. If I was in the store looking for a cure, I could have easily just picked up whatever I saw that was a &quot;remedy&quot; for what I was experiencing. My mother even once bought some homeopathic medicine because of a marketing campaign, having no idea it was homeopathy, and actually, I didn&#x27;t know at first either, I didn&#x27;t look closely at the label, it wasn&#x27;t until later I saw it was. While purchasing medicine, do you turn over the bottle, examine each ingredient, then look up the science behind them? For example there &quot;no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medications in acute cough&quot;[1] and is probably just a placebo,[2] yet people take cough syrup all the time. Even heroin was developed to be a non-additive cough suppressant, and was marketed as such.

They&#x27;re in some sort of weird gray area that is in between medicine and supplements:<p><i>&quot;The legal status of homeopathic remedies in the United States is unique. In 1938, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was sponsored by Senator Royal Copeland who also happened to be a homeopathic physician. The senator wrote wording into his bill that recognized all products listed in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States as drugs and made them subject to regulation by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The legislation passed, and as a result, homeopathic products are legally sold in food stores, pharmacies, and elsewhere as a unique category of drug.</i><p><i>Despite such widespread use, the FDA regulates homeopathic preparations much less stringently than conventional drugs. Homeopathic products are not required to prove effectiveness or safety. Some regulations do apply. For example, homeopathic products can only be sold without a prescription if they are specifically for self-limiting conditions such as the common cold. Products marketed for severe conditions such as cancer are prescription-only.&quot;</i><p>Source:\n<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-1154-HOMEOPATHY.aspx?activeIngredientId=1154&activeIngredientName=HOMEOPATHY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-115...</a><p>That gray area has done a lot of damage to a lot of people.",1395926114

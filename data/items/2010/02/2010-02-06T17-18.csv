However, it <i>is</i> fair to tax the people who have the most.  Determining your income for the year is just a heuristic, and an inaccurate one at that.  However, if you can come up with a 100% fair way to determine whether a person <i>deserves</i> their income based on a tax form, I'd suggest running for Congress or the Presidency.<p>But until that happens, we're just going to have to settle for an imperfect system.

He made his connections by interviewing people when he was younger, and used these connections to intern at a few tech companies.<p>Daniel was definitely old enough to know what he was doing.  The problem was he was so use to doing whatever he wanted in the tech community, he thought he had no boundaries.  He reminds me of Richie Rich- he gets whatever he wants, his parents are never around (at least, not at tech events- every time I've met him, he's been traveling around SF alone), and he's always around older people.<p>Unfortunately, he's reached the point where he's no longer a cute young kid- and, he failed to adapt to his new situation.

That could either be good or worthless, depending on the amount, the valuation, and other terms.<p>FWIW, my guess is that they'd err on the side of ignoring good startups. Amazon has not so far been in the investment business, and I don't think that is their goal here.  Their goal is to promote AWS to startups. They're raising the prospect of investment because they know that's something many startups are interested in.",1189619665

And if you become a finalist, I would think the minimum $5k + publicity is a good tradeoff for the trip to Seattle.<p>A couple of other contests (Adobe, Facebook) were ridiculous because entering the contest, not even winning it, required signing away significant control of your web app and letting the sponsors make derivative web apps.",1189619303

But really, in this case, ""users"" are dedicated communities built around digg, reddit and delicious -- which explains the propensity for technology related news items.<p>2) It could be that users dont prefer to promote mainstream news stories simply because old school media is an existing reliable source of such stories. For example, you could rely on BBC and CNN to report the latest natural disaster -- digg and reddit dont have to do this for their users.",1189617273

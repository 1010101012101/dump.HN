5072320,comment,5071865,5071865,4,0,belorn,,,"ISP today gets to define what approved content is, and there is no end to the methods use to define it. ISP's will continue to expand the sometimes rather arbitrary rules until either government steps in to regulate the industry, or a anti-censorship <i>open by design</i> system will replace the current industry.<p>First the network allowed everything. Then ISPs started with forbidding child porn as the one and only one exceptional rule. Then it was everything except ""illegal content"", being everything before with the added inclusion of copyright infringements. Then extreme porn was added, because anti-porn can always be advertised to end-users as a mechanism for protecting children. Then it is ""mature content"", including anything an ISP might get a letter of complain about, but which does not hurt any business partners. This meant that they can cut cost on support, but at the same time protect any revenue from advertisements. That mean items such as tor, political satire, all form of porn, unpopular religious sites and (anti)social hangouts get listed, but things like alcohol, commercials directed to children, political advertizements, violence and sexual hinting content will be left alone. After that, they start to add items to the list which competes with the ISPs' own products, such as VoIP, but also products that put a strain on their network such as video streaming. The last bans tend to be less severe, as to show how slow competing products are with their low quality of service. This also allow for a mechanism to extract levies from larger companies such as Google without going with a full blown ban that might create outcry from ones consumers.<p>The market won't regulate itself. There are too few options of consumers, and there exist a clear asymmetrical information gap between buyer and seller. Lemon laws for services could help here, but it would be the same effort or even more effort than to create industry regulations for ISPs.",1358427107

5072310,comment,5071001,5071359,5,0,acheron,,,"That's not how it works. The Congress as a whole does not represent the US population as a whole; it's not supposed to, and I'd argue it would be a terrible idea if it did. You have one representative, who represents one district. If the whole Congress represents the whole country, then no individual representative represents any specific area.<p>If a district in Vermont votes 60% R/40% D in favor of a Republican, and a district in West Virginia votes 5% R/95% D in favor of a Democrat, then that argument would say since the total of the two districts is 32.5% R/67.5% D (assuming equal population districts), the ""congress"" of two districts should have two Democrats, rather than one of each. The Vermont district should have no effect on the representation of the West Virginia district.<p>Frankly, I would consider myself more towards the ""anti-democratic"" side: I'm much more on the side of ""democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what to eat for dinner"". Not that the foundation of government shouldn't be democratic, but there need to be very solid protections in place to prevent a majority trampling on a minority. If anything, our system has become too democratic recently; very few of the rights in place to protect us are still respected.

Almost no companies have managed to keep its culture of innovation intact after going public, ergo going public implies death of innovation.<p>What I think is missed is that most companies fail, culturally, before they go public. However, when they're ramping up to IPO, they're putting lots of lipstick on the pig, and no employee wants to say anything contrary for fear of getting canned before a major cash-out.<p>Innovation requires freedom to fail without losing professional status. It requires autonomy for the kinds of people that, in a big company, the CEO will never have heard of. It requires open allocation, at least for the people who are expected to be innovating. See: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Software-Development-Methodologies/What-is-Open-Allocation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Software-Development-Methodologies/What...</a><p>Most startups begin with a constrained open allocation. You can't work on ""whatever you want"" because it's driving toward MVP, product-market fit, and profitability... but any work that is part of the company's mission (and there's plenty of work to do) is fair game for anyone. So the division of labor is pretty much rankless. However, at some point between 15 and 200 employees, most companies close up their project allocation, which means you need to play politics to get assigned to real work.<p>Innovation dies when you go to closed allocation-- you get a caste of entitled, permanent managers who control the division of labor, and use that control toward their own ends (including self-perpetuation). Now, the focus of the individual people is on (a) controlling the division of labor, and (b) getting what they can in terms of job titles in event of exit. The environment becomes so political that people can no longer do real work without shutting themselves away, which usually leads to getting fired.",1358426555

</code></pre>
It is completely disingenuous for Ortiz to maintain that 35 years/$1M wasn't the threat on the table, that we are rubes for thinking that this sticker price was material. That sticker price is exactly what gave her <i>leverage</i> over Swartz, leverage to make 6 months in federal prison and felon status (not to mention legal bankruptcy) seem reasonable by comparison!<p><pre><code>  Ultimately, any sentence imposed would have been up to the

</code></pre>
Exactly, and this is why this random variable was so intimidating. Do you take a guarantee of 6 months in federal prison and permanent felon status? Or a risk of 7 years, or up to 35 years, plus total bankruptcy if you really try to fight?<p>""Ultimately any sentence imposed would have been up to the judge"" and had the judge thrown the book at him Ortiz & Heymann would have washed their hands: ""Oh well, maybe the judge shouldn't have given him 8 years rather than 3, but that's what he gets for not plea bargaining."" This of course disavows Ortiz's and Heymann's own complicity in drumming up PDF downloading into a federal case.<p>This woman really feels like her office's actions were justified, and that's the scary part. You get a sense of what Aaron was up against. She needs to feel what it's like to be in a no-win situation herself, with the choice being resignation or getting fired.

So, for a new unknown download, all it can do immediately is check for best-practices that can include: a valid code signature, a known software publisher, secure file delivery, and source site(s) reputation. Even failing this, the warning for an unknown executable is not that it's malware, but that it ""is not commonly downloaded and could be dangerous.""<p>So, a cursory look shows that the installer referenced in this blog post has no signature and isn't being served securely. That means the user (and SafeBrowsing) have no way of knowing if the correct file is even being served, or if it was (for example) replaced by a man-in-the-middle attack. That hurts a file's initial reputation, and since Safebrowsing hasn't had a chance to fully analyze the file, it's pretty much indistinguishable from malware at this stage. However, once the file works its way through the pipeline and has a chance to establish reputation, a safe file will eventually be marked as such.<p>For anyone who wants to eliminate latency with Safebrowsing, the solution is really just common best-practices for software distribution: sign your packages, serve them securely, and maintain a safe site.

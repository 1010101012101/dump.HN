Ultimate Ears are amazing.<p>I'm not even sure what the poster is looking for here. Simple physics get in the way of most of the lower cost designs. You can't block out the world without a proper fit (molds), you can't pack a ton of circuitry into the IEMs without size being a factor, and it requires tuning and alignment to make these devices accurate.<p>There's a reason why UE's are expensive - Someone has to hand build and align them.

This is obvious, because it's clearly lawful for the police to simply follow you around in public.</i><p>This isn't obvious to me at all. I think you're falling into a trap peculiar to computer security in particular, generalizing from binary distinctions of ""secure"" vs ""insecure"", or ""anonymous"" vs ""authenticated"" as if these things were matters of Boolean logic, rather than of probabilities and degrees, in arenas outside of the easily automated.<p>If you're being followed around in public, that is by itself obvious; it normally affects your behaviour, it's stressful, and in fact prisons (Panopticon) have been designed around the idea of being under constant surveillance. The specific and explicit goal of such was ""obtaining power of mind over mind""; if you don't think those who literally seek power do not have similar motives, you're naive.<p>The cost of following someone around means that it will only be applied in cases where police value it highly; presumably, incentives up the chain of command are aligned such that that level of investment is only made when the public interest is high; similarly, the levels of manpower will mean that conspiracy and persecution would be hard to hide.<p>When the effect of following someone around - knowing where they are at all times - is automated and based on cheap technology - indeed, technology whose cost is largely borne by those being followed, for phones - then the bar for following is much lowered. Far more trivial cases can have this level of intrusiveness applied to them; the public interest may not be so well served. Furthermore, without appropriate controls, persecution by individuals is enabled, without any need for a group conspiracy. For example, ex-husbands with access may spy on the location of their ex-wives and further their own corrupt, human goals.",1333324304

Consider, however, that work must be done both when constructing the memory and also when repeating it.

If you have decent social skills, you can get a 90% guess at which way things are going to go, but that's far from certainty, and the boss who won't throw you under the bus for his own benefit is very rare.<p>Big companies are only a better option than any other job (in terms of job security) if they subvert manager-as-SPOF and that's really hard to do. What seems to work (perversely) is bureaucracy and obfuscation: if you make it very, very hard for a manager to bad-mouth reports to the managers they want to transfer under (in large part, this requires transfer talks occurring without the original manager's knowledge) you can actually create a culture in which managers don't hold all the cards.<p>Big-company vs. startup is a hard question.

It's like IE never got the news that the browser wars are over and continues to implement the CSS spec whatever way it wants at times.<p>We already live with the features that work properly but why can't we criticize features that <i>dont</i> work properly? When a spec changes we can't expect old versions of browsers to support it, that's fine. But when a spec changes and a new version of a browser comes out claiming to support it but really doesn't then we have every right to criticize it.<p>When IE9 came out Microsoft raved about how advanced it was and how we would get to play with all the new css3 features, etc. but that wasn't true. It was a big leap forward from version 8 but still not up to snuff compared to other browsers.<p>We certainly can create products that are incredibly useful even in older browsers but it's ludicrous to say we should just live with the limited feature set of IE. we're talking about the web here. A place where technology moves so fast that paradigms shift in a matter of months, not years. When every other browser on the market has been reliably supporting X features for several years now but one holdout still doesn't implement it like any of the others at all I'd say we have the right to criticize it.<p>Your tone makes me out to be like someone who just discovered web design and is using it like people used to use the blink tag in the 90's. That's not the case. This isn't about bandwagons nor is about the CSS3 features I mentioned. I only used those because they came to mind first. I'm very aware of design elements that are overused and those that need to be used with caution. You need to remember that functionality is only a piece of the puzzle. Backend design and front end design both play critical roles in making the user happy. Good design is about surprise and delight and since most browsers support it, we should be able to use parts of the new CSS spec now but IE is still holding us back as it always has. There are good reasons to use these features and not all people who use rounded corners and gradients are using them gratuitously like you imply.<p>Here are my reasons for wanting to use them:\nI want to cut down on the use of images for design (I can literally cut 90% of my image use by using css3). I want to speed up page load times. Stop depending on JavaScript as much (related to load times too). Finally, I just want to surprise and delight my users. Give them a beautiful experience. What I build may do its job but if its interface is boring and a chore to use then I messed up my job.<p>So should we all just ""support the working features"" of the lowest common denominator despite the fact that there's a ton of great features that are widely supported elsewhere already? Please don't be a design snob and look down your nose and assume anyone using css3 is jumping on some bandwagon lest you miss the point entirely.",1333322120

There are components with a front end in JavaScript/CoffeeScript and a back end running on Node.js and Mongodb. CodeMirror to edit the HTML/CSS and Javascript or CoffeeScript for the front end and also the CoffeeScript/JavaScript of the backend of each component.<p>Front end components (widgets) are composable.  As far as CRUD goes there are a lot of different types of forms people want and so there isn't going to be a built-in widget for everything, but to start with, there is a record widget, a field widget, and a list widget.  These widgets would be associated with certain collections or fields in a database and so there can be multiple list widgets for example displaying data in different ways.<p>To start with I am working on the basic component framework and editor with some type of drag-and-drop composability for the front-end widgets.

Five percent of employees end up on PIPs for no other reason than getting shat on in Neutron-Jack-style stack-ranking. People on PIPs can't transfer. They rarely actually get fired (most quit, most PIPs on people who stay are inconclusive; rare is for a person to get fired and even rarer is for a person to actually <i>pass</i>... inconclusive PIPing isn't ""passing"" because it leads to a shorter and more obnoxious PIP, 2 quarters later) but the effect is just the same-- an utterly fucking pointless waste of peoples' time, jobs lost for no good reason, billions of dollars of capital being destroyed. I'd guess that most of those people who run afoul of the completely arbitrary 5% yank-point are on those launch-and-flee systems.<p>Then there is the rampant abuse of process that goes on related to Perf. I know one person who, as a protest, wrote negative unsolicited feedback to 5 random Googlers each cycle. I would actually say that he is a lot more unethical than Perf's designers, but it just shows how silly the whole system is.<p>Then there's Real Names (for which people were PIP'd if not fired, even though Google is supposed to be so open it would never do that). Don't get me started on that shit. With Real Names, I can only ask: do you not <i>want</i> your product to succeed? Are you afraid of users?<p>I think Google is unethical to promote and retain, in management positions, sometimes with global impact, severe and obvious incompetents in the same way that it's unethical to let a 4-year-old fly a plane.

The start-up community is relatively small, the number of people in that community who are investors is even smaller; the pool of founders is very large. Many, if not most, founders know very little about investors and who they can reach out to. So their perception is that, if you need funding you take what you can get. Especially when you hear NO after NO... Beggars can't be choosers. Is it ideal, of course not, but it is what it is...",1333321394

There was no real argument, no mentioned technologies, that were the ice-breaker.<p>Sure, in IE6, even the PNGs weren't working properly, but, talking layout, IE7+ is mostly a question of 5-10 additional rules (on small scale websites) and IE8 actually works without any (mostly), save for a css3 features like border-radius, etc.<p>As for the design, having less visual effects and no rounded corners doesn't have to be a problem – most of the designs work without it rather well (not to mention 4ormat's design doesn't use plasticity, gradients and shadows that much)<p>This article would gain much more credibility if it mentioned\n at least one or two technological obstacles that take you more than 30 minutes to sort out.",1333321258

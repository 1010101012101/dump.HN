219205,comment,218828,218828,0,0,icey,,,"First off, definitely use a cover letter. Don't use your template, write something specifically about why you want <i>this</i> job at <i>this</i> company. Be sincere.<p>With regards to a suit; here's what I've always done. I suppose it's a little risky, but it's always been fantastic for me.<p>Call the company you're interviewing, at whatever public number you find. Hopefully you get a receptionist, or at least someone gabby. Tell them that you're coming in for an interview, and you'd really like to dress appropriately - so instead of asking for advice, ask what their boss is wearing that day. If the answer is slacks and a button-up shirt (short-sleeved or not), then you're going to wear a coat and tie for the interview. If the answer is jeans, then you're going to wear slacks, polished shoes and a button up shirt.<p>You don't have to be shy about this, companies really like to know that you give a shit about what they think. It definitely shows when I'm interviewing with someone who knows why they want to work with us versus someone who just wants a paycheck.",1213656388

Yet all the thought energy of the public is directed toward the demand side (either reducing/conserving things, or changing the sourse). Yet if we were to solve the supply side in a sustainable manner, we would solve a whole lot of other things very very quickly.",1213656324

So this is really just part of the schtick.<p>Certainly, yes, they need to be good to their employees.  But part of that means being good to their existing employees, who no doubt have bought into the rock star thing.

That's not a tall order, it's basic writing etiquette. This is your job application. It's your first impression. Spelling is important.<p>If you can't get that right, or don't notice that it's wrong, then I don't think you are paying attention to the kind of details that we think are important. Spelling, writing, paying attention to spaces, characters, letters -- those things are important to us.<p>It's not pretentious of an employer to expect someone to check their spelling -- especially the spelling of the company name. That's a basic writing skill. If you are applying for a job you better believe it matters to the employer. Ignore that advice at your own risk.",1213655875

The candidate, gracious for even the opportunity to apply for such a choice offer, spends hours proofreading and otherwise perfect his or her resume and cover letter.<p>What this ignores is reality. Often the people you want to hire couldn't care less about sending you a resume to prove to you why you are worth their time. They have got better things to do -- and probably a good job that already pays them quite well, thank you very much.<p>I'm nitpicking a bit here -- obviously it pays to be professional in your communications, no matter what the circumstances. But it's an exceedingly dangerous mentality, particularly for companies operating in our space, where good talent is quite scarce. 37 Signals (oops!

Allow them to do all that WITHOUT having to register. Store a cookie that connects that user to all the info they just inputted which is in your DB. Then tell them to register to save that info. Why require them to register first? If they like your service, and put all that time into adding their info, they will register.",1213653954

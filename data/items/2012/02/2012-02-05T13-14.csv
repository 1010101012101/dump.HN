3554028,comment,3553530,3553920,1,0,Chris_Newton,,,"It's not a foregone conclusion at all.<p>From a commercial point of view, DRM ""works"" if it ultimately prevents more lost sales than it causes.<p>In a small niche market, where plenty of users are quite capable of right-click-saving a video but relatively few would know how to break more serious DRM, it is entirely plausible that such DRM would prevent a lot of casual copying.<p>As I said, I don't personally like this idea (and in fact our test programme isn't using DRM right now) but there have been lively discussions about this issue and the truth is that no-one really knows what would happen either way. I'm more interested in empirical evidence than thought experiments, assumptions/generalisations that small media will work the same as Big Media, or the wishful thinking of people reading on-line forums who have the luxury of risking nothing when they downvote a situation they don't like.<p>Edit: The other thing to keep in mind is which of these decisions are one-way. If we decide to launch with DRM and it turns out not to be effective for us, it costs us relatively little if we decide to back it out and serve everything unlocked later. On the other hand, if DRM <i>is</i> effective in our market but we serve everything unlocked initially and people take advantage, Pandora's box is open.",1328449723

On my build server this script completes in <1 second for all the files I've ever tried (My build server is Intel i7, so that might have something to do with it). Even so compared to the time needed to rsync the files to the app servers, or compress the images, this doesn't really make much difference.<p>Dependency graphs are cool and useful, but the idea of this project is, very much, to simply cat files together. It also has the advantage of being able to generate the bundle info file so you can use URLs with hashes in for CDN's/cache-ability (Like Rails asset pipeline does).<p>So in short, it was built to be a shit simple system to make my life easier, if you dislike it feel free to use something else, as is the nature of Open Source",1328449711
3554025,comment,3553853,3553853,5,0,dalke,,,"The abstract from the 1998 paper is:<p>Three experiments examine what is widely reported to be one of the most common forms of interference in open-plan office environmentsthe effect of background noise. Experiment 1 investigates whether office noise (with or without speech) is disruptive to two office-related tasks: memory for prose and mental arithmetic. The results show that whereas office noise with speech disrupts performance on both tasks, office noise without speech disrupts performance on the mental arithmetic task only. Experiment 2 investigates the memory for prose task more closely by varying the duration and the meaning of the background noise. Experiment 3 examines whether the meaning of speech is important to the disruption of a mental arithmetic task. The results show that both speech and office noise can disrupt performance on memory for prose and mental arithmetic tasks, and the effect is independent of the meaning of the irrelevant speech. These results are presented and interpreted in light of current research and theories regarding the effect of background noise.",1328449710

Open-plan offices are optimized for availability.<p>Closed-door environments aren't great either. They might be good for the individual, but not for the team. Also, in the long-term, people who close their doors not to perform as well: they're more productive on an hour-by-hour basis, but they miss out on a lot of important conversations. Since 95% of the information that's actually important is conveyed in informal conversations rather than meetings, that can become an issue.<p>What I think would work best is something like a restaurant booth in shape, but with 12-hour chairs (you can't work for a full day in a restaurant booth). The table is a common space for the team, but everyone has a wall at their back. Open-back visibility (and worse yet, rear traffic) is often more of a productivity-killer and anxiety-producer than noise.",1328448361

After all, we see these types of relationships everywhere -- Big Brother/Big Sisters, Boy Scouts, Youth Religious Groups, Mentoring relationships in school and college, etc.<p>But there's always some kind of goal, and some kind of trust structure built by society to protect (or at least try to protect) the innocent.

It's out of whack.<p>I know I was in a chat system a couple of weeks ago in a room that was politics and ""R"" rated. (Hey -- politics is always R-Rated!) I got a ""hey there"" IM from a person with a nickname of ""April 14, 1939"". We started chatting, and it took about 20 minutes for me to figure out it was a 12-year-old using god-knows-who's nickname. (The bad grammar and vocabulary were a hint)<p>I know I was uncomfortable. I told the kid he should use sites with his own age group. I also chided him on his poor grammar and vocabulary and told him we'd talk some other time (we didn't).<p>It's weird and it's uncomfortable. I'm not saying it's wrong -- I'm sure there are good things that can come out of these relationships. Kids need role models. Adults usually have been through a lot of the problems that kids are going to face and can help out a lot. But gee -- you get these ""ambush"" friendship deals...<p>I think there's a great potential for good here. I also think there is something very wrong going on.

This seems to be an issue that starts from even the early days of education where the difference is small (in most schools, hanging out with people more than 1 or 2 grades above/below you is often considered weird by the peer groups).<p>However, online it is more to do with shared interests, ability, and many other factors rather than age. Age does not matter. Cases in point: Who knows the ages of the people we interact with on HN - does it matter? All the startups, in past and present cycles (e.g. soccernet.com, facebook.com) created by very young people - did the users/ buyers/advertisers (most of whom are in different age groups) know or care about this?",1215439939

People from across the world could have great interactions that they would not have if not for the internet.<p>However, the internet also provides anonymity for perverts and pedophiles, giving them the freedom to do whatever they want.<p>Younger people may be a bit more wary when someone older friends them because of the latter, which an unfortunate truth.",1215439827

Think 'body high'<p>Those FUD commercials you see with the kids deflated on the couch?  Indica.  The commercials you don't see?  Well those would be showing motivated Ph.D students working their ass off after smoking a little Sativa (apparently unaware of the chemistry behind the scenes if this article is any judge).<p>Lesson for kids:  Do your homework (this applies to your hobbies too)  If you think just smoking weed will help your studies, at least make sure you're buying the right kind or a hybrid which will give you a little of both.",1215439765

Unfortunately in a land where using the Spring framework is a big risk (e.g. corporate software development), BDD is not going to be widely adopted, let alone seriously considered. Startups are for those who want to expand their technological comfort zone. Average companies in the other hand, they're fine with remaining average.",1215439650

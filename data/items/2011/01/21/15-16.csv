I don't think I once heard someone say ""I'd really prefer to work on a PC"".  This was primarily a web development firm, so it didn't really matter which environment you used. There was a smaller group that was developing some .Net desktop software, and even they preferred to use Mac+Windows VM than to have a PC.",1295625574

So that instead of needing to write html/javascript/css, a developer codes to an api that operates at a higher level (in much the same way that developers of GUI applications code to an api that operates at a high level).<p>Are there web frameworks that insulate developers totally from html/javascript/css?

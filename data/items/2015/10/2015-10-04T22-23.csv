They told me that if I registered with them, it&#x27;d take me 6 months to get any money. At that time I was being taken on a 2nd interview by two companies, so I figured, I&#x27;d rather focus on that. I also started doing freelancing for an entrepreneur.

He always seems nice, but then postpones it. He doesn&#x27;t have much money himself, and I do am asking him to do a full-fledged contract, so that unemployment services would recognize it and skip the 6 months delay - this has a cost as he has to pay somebody else to do the paperwork. We had a group phone call with that person in August where we agreed on the principle.<p>I have two possibilities right now. 1. I asked him to send me money without doing a contract, so that I could buy food and pay rent a few more months, hoping I find a job before that dries out as well. This seems to meet less resistance with him, but will he actually pay? 2.

Analog computers require shielding, good ground planes, and bypass caps on power at each IC.<p>I once had two 555 timers, set up as oscillators, on a solderless breadboard, and they&#x27;d phase-lock just from inductive coupling if they were near the same frequency. Without bypass caps at each IC, they&#x27;d phase-lock even when the frequencies weren&#x27;t close, at some ratio like 7:6.  When the big power transistor in a 555 switches, it introduces a transient, which gets into the input signals. Fun to watch on a scope.<p>While you can build analog differentiators, they&#x27;re so noise-sensitive that they&#x27;re almost useless. Combined differentiators and low-pass filters can work, but a pure differentiator tries to track the slope of every tiny noise event.

The methodology is:<p>> The dataset seeks to include all American citizens and residents indicted or convicted for terrorism crimes who were inspired by or associated with Al Qaeda and its affiliated groups as well as those citizens and residents who were killed before they could be indicted but have been widely reported to have worked with or been inspired by al-Qaeda and its affiliated groups. The dataset does not include extremists tied to violent Islamist groups that do not target the United States as part of al-Qaeda’s war, for example Hamas and Hezbollah, nor does it include individuals who were acquitted or charged with lesser crimes, for example immigration violations, that cannot be shown to involve some kind of terrorism-related crime.<p>> The dataset also includes individuals inspired by right wing, left wing, and other non-Jihadist political ideologies, who have been indicted for terrorism related crimes. The data on non-Jihadist extremists is less developed than the data on Jihadist extremists but where available it is included to provide a comparison across ideologies. The dataset relies mainly upon court documents, wire service reports, and news reports as sources.",1443997442

Blackberry got the ball rolling in the early 2000&#x27;s, but it was the release of iPhone and Android that got vendors rich.<p>Apple and Google created API&#x27;s and enrollment processes to manage devices (device lock, wipe, etc.). Companies created software to consume those API&#x27;s, the biggest being AirWatch, Mobile Iron, and MaaS360. AirWatch was acquired by VMware for $1.5billion in 2014 and Mobile Iron went public, rising 22% in the first day of trading. MaaS360 was acquired by IBM for several hundred million.<p>At first, license fees were high, competition wasn&#x27;t too fierce, and the market was booming.<p>Then many more low-cost players moved in. Open source MDM software appeared. One company (Miradore) gives MDM away for free to hook customers on IT management fees and various other upsells. Mobile Iron stock is down 70% for the year.<p>I was listening to an NPR podcast this morning and heard an advertisement for a product named Bushel doing Apple MDM. I think the definition of commoditized tech is when you hear companies advertising on NPR.<p>My take on the situation is that it&#x27;s risky to build a core business merely consuming other company&#x27;s API&#x27;s. Doing analysis and more advanced things, sure. But simply executing an API command is not special. The MDM list of features is completely controlled by Apple and Android manufacturers, and anytime they release a new feature, every MDM player instantly gets access to it. The only differentiation between products becomes how effectively they use the pre-existing API&#x27;s (scaling, integration with other enterprise products, etc.) and pricing. This obviously becomes a race-to-the-bottom on pricing, destroying margins.<p>The reason I know so much about this is that I work at a company called Apperian, focusing on Mobile Application Management (MAM). We use to compete with the MDM guys, but it&#x27;s a completely different game now. All of our core technology is unique, most of it is patented / patent pending, and we solve problems that the MDM API&#x27;s cannot. We dominate the MAM industry, although niche and much smaller than the MDM sector, is growing very quickly. It would be extremely difficult and costly for a company to implement what we do, in contrast to the MDM guys.<p>It&#x27;s been very interesting to watch the rise and fall of big players, as our sales keep booming. I will keep watching the drama unfold.",1443997380

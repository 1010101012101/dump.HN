(and periodically referring to the FAQ when I'm stumped by design decisions)<p>It's been enjoyable learning it, though I'm yet to write any code in anger with Go. I find some of the concepts around concurrency and OO design have really made me think about the way I write in other languages.<p>One thing I cannot quite make sense of though is the treatment of errors/exceptions. This article says:\n""Exceptions make it too easy to ignore them rather than handle them, passing the buck up the call stack..""<p>But the example given seems to me to do exactly that:<p>if err != nil {\n	return err\n}<p>Worse still if you forget to do something with err, or don't handle a specific err !=nil situation, it seems easy for control to flow past the error handling and into code that expects no errors.<p>Are there small, easily understood open source projects written in Go, that would provide tangible examples of the benefit of this error handling approach?<p>The learning materials thus far have not really convinced me, maybe code in the wild would.",1354679899

But it can't, for three reasons: 10 ms seek times, RAM that is much smaller than disk, and garbage collection.<p>10 ms seek times mean that fast random access across large disk files just isn't possible. There is a vast amount of literature and research devoted to getting over this specific limitation. And it isn't old, either: all of the recent work on big data is aimed at resolving the tension between sequential disk access, which is fast, and random access, which is required for executing queries.<p>RAM that is smaller than disk means that virtual disk files don't work very well when you have large data files. If you try to map more than the amount of physical RAM you get a mess: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12572157/using-lots-of-mappedbytebuffers-in-read-write-mode-slows-down-windows-7-to-a-cr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12572157/using-lots-of-ma...</a><p>Garbage collection means that it is easy to allocate a bit of memory, and then let it go when the reference goes out of scope. There's no need to explicitly deallocate it. It's one of the things that makes modern programming efficient. With disk, you don't get that; if you write something, you've got to erase it or disk fills up.<p>In short, this guy's casual contempt for ""1975 programming"" is irksome, because it's clear that he isn't working on the same class of problems that the rest of us are. He may be able to get away with virtual memory for his limited application, but the rest of us can't.",1354679546

I mean in tech, we mock those with more money, more capital, because we know that no body lasts - everyone is disrupted, and so it goes.

They want a living, breathing being to do XYZ to.  Employee productivity takes a backseat to pointy-haired-boss productivity (and that of their cousin, pointy-haired-investor), and since the employee isn't signing the checks..<p>I think it'd make an excellent thought experiment, particularly with bay area rents being what they are, to try to launch a company where all staff must reside in the same structure but don't have to work from there (or are even expressly forbidden from doing much work there).

If the lead is at PK, then guess what, i'm getting up at 3am to talk to them.  Sending emails wont cut it.  He then has to translate to a different language and hands it out to his devs.  Thats several degrees of separation between the analyst and the dev.  I've always believed that what was accomplished could have taken half that team if they were all local.<p>I think software development insourcing is ripe for this in the U.S.  There is a large cost of living divide between NY, SF and Missoula, MT and the mid lvl salaries i've seen here would go a LOT further in those parts of the country and the time zone and language issues are minimal.",1354678494

4874719,comment,4874304,4874564,26,0,ChuckMcM,,,"As others have noted the rant is from 2008, which is interesting because this was the transition point between wide spread adoption of 64 bit aware OSes from 32 bit aware OSes [1]. You can see lots of folks who are just getting their feet wet with 64 bit Linux [2], and configured memory sizes are getting up over 4GB 'real' memory.<p>One of the wonderful things about 64 bit address spaces? You don't ever have to re-use an address. Once folks figure that out you can do some amazing things that would have seemed stupid in the 70's, you can <i>hard code</i> the address for every single library function on your machine. Can you even imagine how weird that would be? Linking time would be instantaneous, calling printf? its always at 0x10015081aaf10000, all of libc? starting at 0x1000000000000 and working up. One giant database of the 'standard place' to put every single function. Remember when the 32 bit OS would put the kernel at 0x80000000 ? You know right on the 2G border, above that, kernel space, below that user space.<p>Anyway, I completely concur that abstractions that worked before, work wonderfully today. But I also don't worry about an array of 100M items on a server in RAM anymore. Using mmap to map a 1G file into the address space? Not a problem.<p>Its interesting to watch the behavior of systems when they are essentially all in memory.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/vista-workshop,1775-3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/vista-workshop,1775-3.ht...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://blekko.com/ws/?q=64+bit+linux+%2Fdate%3D2008"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blekko.com/ws/?q=64+bit+linux+%2Fdate%3D2008</a>",1354678457

My first foray into ""professional"" software development, about 18 months ago:<p>I was an intern in college getting a CS degree, just finished my senior year.  I had an summer internship lined up with a small company but they folded at the last minute so I had to scramble for something to fill my summer.  I wound up as an intern at a financial firm.  Fairly large but not one you've probably heard of.<p>I was told that I'd be on the mobile development team.  They knew I didn't have experience but I said I was eager to learn.<p>Turns out, there was no team.  <i>I</i> was the team.  The CIO had decided that they needed an iPhone app, despite being an entirely B2B company with virtually no consumer brand awareness, and he'd already sold the corner office crowd on the idea.<p>Problem is, no one in IT wanted to build it.  The CIO had no clue what he actually wanted, they were understaffed as it was and no one had the time.<p>Enter me.<p>In my first meeting with the CIO, he pulled out his iPhone, went to m.msn.com and said ""I want this but for $COMPANY.""  I went back and laughed in my cube for a while.  I think he just liked the news article carousel MSN had.<p>My boss had talked him down to a mobile website which I began throwing together in jQuery Mobile.  A few loan calculators and some contact info.  I had a few ideas for something more aggressive but I got shot down as they needed me on other projects anyways.  They had me spending a few hours a week on mobile dev just to keep the CIO happy.<p>My internship ended right as the CIO was bringing in a big consulting firm to replace everyone.  And that's the story of how I decided not to work at a megacorp.",1354678281

At best, they understand it as letting you swap out memory to disk when memory runs low.<p>Even ignoring Kamp's ""mmap the world"" approach, if I brought up any of his other ideas in a meeting with most programmers, there'd be immediate cries of premature optimization (and reinventing the wheel, in the case of using a single malloc'd chunk for workspaces). Never mind what we're talking about building or what we already know about the performance of different approaches, and never mind that a lot of important performance decisions are architectural and are a lot harder to change later on.<p>These ideas just aren't on most programmers' radarit's all evil voodoo to be avoided at all costs to them.<p>How many programmers know the effect of a write from one CPU on the next read from another CPU on the same cache line? How many programmers know the relative cost of a syscall vs. a function call? How many programmers ever think about optimizing their use of CPU cache?<p>Most of the time they get away with ignoring these things because they really don't matter in context. But sometimes they don't get away with it because these things do matter, and in those moments I wish more programmers had a better understanding of their machines and their operating systems.",1354676955

4874641,comment,4873471,4873471,5,0,millstone,,,"I continue to be confused by how Go gets positioned. From the article:<p><i>""Go is a programming language designed by Google to help solve Google's problems, and Google has big problems. The hardware is big and the software is big. There are many millions of lines of software, with servers mostly in C++ and lots of Java and Python....And of course, all this software runs on zillions of machines, which are treated as a modest number of independent, networked compute clusters""</i><p>The author moved effortlessly from ""Google's problems"" to ""servers"" that are ""networked compute clusters."" That's quite a leap, because it's certainly not true that ""<i></i>all<i></i> this software"" runs in that manner. Android does not, Chrome does not, Chrome OS does not, the iOS YouTube app does not, Google Earth does not, etc. And there's plenty of not-big hardware that Google writes for, like laptops and phones.<p>And the reason I bring this up is because Go was explicitly pitched as a systems programming language - see the PDF <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/100428-pike-stanford.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/100428-pike-st...</a>. Programming tools, IDEs, web browsers, operating systems (""maybe"") are among the tasks specifically called out as suitable for Go.

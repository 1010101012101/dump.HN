65715,comment,65678,65678,0,0,jamescoops,,,"I think you need to distinguish between a niche social network and a niche community.  Social networking is effectively a specific bundle of features (profiles, friend/ buddy-lists) but there are a raft of social features that can be deployed as part of a community that may be more effective.  For example, whilst a social network for sports fans might not work, some kind of wiki/ digg combination might be killer. \n",1192001872

65713,comment,65221,65221,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"""The world just got unbundled. Like it or not, there you are.""<p>The world has been unbundled for some time.  Some largish media companies have a history of making a stink about this in the form of trying to stop what they mistakenly called ""deep linking"".  As if the Web were not, you know, a <i>web</i>, but rather a nice linear set of defined paths and pages.<p>Godin's advice isn't wrong or bad, but it's something that information architects have been pointing out for some time now; you cannot assume how a user reaches any give page.

65712,comment,65566,65620,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Since Google makes a point of marking the link as ""sponsored"" and having a different background color I doubt most users click on it thinking it's a search result.<p>On the other hand I have witnessed with my parents that they don't differentiate between the URL bar and the google search box and most often type the URLs directly into Google. But I've never seen them click on an add as a result of this.",1192000660

65708,comment,65657,65657,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"cmdrtaco does have a point.  These community news sites are great when the community reflects your views, but once the community grows they stake to not reflect your views.<p>One way to correct this is to only get news from a group that is similar to you (for some definition of 'similar').  One attempt to do this is my Wildfire application for Facebook which shows you news from your friends.<p><a href=""http://www.jgc.org/blog/2007/09/problems-with-social-news.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jgc.org/blog/2007/09/problems-with-social-news.ht...</a><p>John.\n",1191999841

65706,comment,65678,65678,0,0,h34t,,,"Connectedness to the things that matter to me is like oxygen. <p>I think websites that connect people to ideas and people they care about will only grow in importance and popularity as more and more hackers get the little things right (user experience), and implementing these as features of a site becomes easier and cheaper (less time and money) so that more sites can be driven by those with the best connections and insight into their community, rather than by those who happen to have the right tech skills.<p>At least, I hope this is what happens. It can be a lonely world out here. There are few things as important (and, for many, as difficult) as finding the right people and information to surround yourself when you exit ""the system"" and are faced with crafting your life experience all on your own. <p>The internet may already have come a long way, but I think this is just the beginning.",1191999744

It will, however, be very useful for creating (or porting) games and other multimedia experiences.  The iPhone 4G will likely have a higher resolution screen and Flash itself mostly resolution independent -- it might not take long for Adobe to update CS5 and all those developers could have 4G ready high-res apps in less time than it takes an Objective-C developers to fire up Photoshop.  It's really not as simple as you make it out to be.<p>> Do previously submitted applications using Apple's APIs directly automatically inherit the camera switch button?<p>Most likely not.<p>> Is the user going to sit there fumbling with the app annoyed that they can't use the features of the new phone they bought?<p>It's been mentioned many times when discussing Apple's rule changes that developers and apps are easily replaceable.

...This principle of limitation means that some weight needs to be given to the negative consequences of full disclosure, creating a practical and ethical dilemma. The Society of Professional Journalists' code of ethics offers the following advice, which is representative of the practical ideals of most professional journalists. Quoting directly:[17]<p>* Show compassion for those who may be affected adversely by news coverage.<p>* Be sensitive when seeking or using interviews or photographs of those affected by tragedy or grief.<p>* Recognize that gathering and reporting information may cause harm or discomfort. Pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance.<p>* Recognize that private people have a greater right to control information about themselves than do public officials and others who seek power, influence or attention.

If Adobe's UI control doesn't include a camera switching button what happens when you install the app on an iPhone 4G? Do you have to wait for Adobe to update their library and for the developer to re-submit the application? Do previously submitted applications using Apple's APIs directly automatically inherit the camera switch button? Is the user going to sit there fumbling with the app annoyed that they can't use the features of the new phone they bought? To me that's a very compelling case to restrict non-Apple approved tools.

They've already picked up the people who've gotten burned, and most future daters who get burned will stick to free dating sites afterwards... so this won't get them many more users than they would have received anyway.<p>It just might stop some suckers from being parted from their money.",1271739848

They've resisted making any substantial changes to the basic hardware profile of the iPod Touch / iPhone lineup ever since it was released, presumably to save developers from having to target multiple devices (and this is still a point raised as a complaint against android all the time).",1271739715

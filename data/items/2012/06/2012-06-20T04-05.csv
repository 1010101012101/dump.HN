Neither are departments likely to have soaring costs: all you need is a classroom and professor. Lecturers in the classics will probably not even break 50k, while language classes are even cheaper since they're often offloaded to graduate students teaching from standard texts. As long as there are students opting to take those courses, they should be printing money for the university.<p>So unless there has been gross mismanagement of these departments for decades (aggressive hiring and declining enrollment), it is hard to believe that costs could get out of line. And closing down popular and should-be-profitable classes in order to funnel students to other departments in the name of economic efficiency is a very strange move.",1340167544

4135639,comment,4127664,4127664,2,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"For the system I've been working on for the past year, most domain-ish objects extend from a class called AbstractImmutableObject which implements both hashCode() and equals() as final methods.  Then, subclasses are forced to implement a ""collectObjects()"" method which effectively creates an array of instance variable references (plus autoboxed primitives) for a deep implementation of equality and a guaranteed consistent hash code.  Immutability currently is enforced by convention, but I think FindBugs could help out.  Presuming that all the instance variables in the graph of AbstractImmutableObjects are primitives or JDK objects with consistent hash functions, the resultant hashcode will be consistent as well.<p>[As an aside, I dislike this sort of utility base class, but it's a small price to pay for avoiding awful bugs related to hashcodes being inconsistent with equals, etc.]<p>I also argue that computing a hash on a serialization of an object graph is problematic as well.  What are the rules for computing the hash of a serialization of a set of Strings?  Must one sort the Strings before serializing them to ensure that any two Sets with the same values have the same hashcode?  Sets are not required to maintain an ordering and equals() on sets ignores order (but not on SortedSet), so I would expect my ""distributed"" hashcode to be the same for any Set containing the same Strings.  Such a scheme couples my serialization scheme tightly with my rules for equivalence.  As I like to use serialization schemes written by others when possible and I don't want to eat the cost of serialization whenever I want a consistent hashcode, I'd prefer to decouple these ideas.<p>Recently, I've gone a step further with our domain objects and have written a generator of builders and instances using dynamic proxies (just the out-of-the-box JDK 1.3 era stuff).  Developers just define interfaces, and unit tests enforce rules about what objects may be contained within the object graphs.  This makes it really simple to implement things like round-trip JSON ser/deser.  Because the realm of possibilities is so limited, it's easy to ensure correctness.<p>[As an aside, I'd love to have a DSL for such domain objects and then write a bunch of dynamic pieces parts for serialization, meta-stuff (creating a Guava function in a literate sort of way for any path through a domain object, etc.), builders, etc.  I guess this is one step down the rabbit hole of model driven development, but I'm looking for something a bit lighter than, say, AndroMDA).]",1340166814

This is in preference to hard-coding calls to the system time in test, which imho one should never do.<p>Once an arbitrary time function can be passed as a parameter, one can provide a mock or fake system clock for test purposes.  Ideally one would still want to test under daylight savings' conditions.  But at the least this approach leaves one in a place where one can test the common 24-hours-in-a-day case without having the tests spuriously fail two days out of every year.",1340166291

Where is it that I tried to say something and, per your assertion, did not?<p>Having strong disagreements is part of life at many levels, not just business.  Resorting to name-calling and insults when this happens is a formula guaranteed to not get anyone what they ultimately want.  Linus is lucky that he is who he is.  Anyone else would not be invited to a second talk, ever, for behaving that way.  He gets a pass because he is a rock star.<p>The distinction here is between publicly deriding someone and having a private argument (with yelling, screaming and name-calling if you'd like).  In some circles private arguments can get rather heated and might even descend into name-calling and personal attacks.  I am not saying that's OK, but if it is going to happen it should be in a private setting.  Once you cross the private-public threshold and deride someone (or an entire organization) in a very public way you are ringing a bell that cannot be un-rung.  That is not professional behavior.  Period.<p>This has nothing to do with the use of profanity.  Under some circumstances profanity can convey a message far more efficiently than half a page full of sentences.  That is not the problem.<p>What you and others might fail to recognize is that the question he was asked and the opportunity he had was golden. It was an opportunity to connect need with request.  Rather than telling nVidia to go fuck themselves he could have taken the opportunity to deliver a mutually beneficial message that could actually produce the desired results.  Maybe something like this:<p>""nVidia produces some of the most amazing graphics hardware in the market.  While I am not a gamer I understand what they are doing and have come to appreciate the level of performance and features they put into their products.  We, unfortunately, have an issue with regards to the way they've chosen to support <chip name> in Linux.  I understand why they are choosing that path but would sure love to re-engage in a discussion in order to see if we can find an approach that would bring to Linux what we need from nVidia without causing them undue support issues.  It is also important that you, the audience present here and watching this online engage with nVidia and voice your support for an approach that serves Linux well""<p>That was seat-of-the-pants but the general idea is that you take the opportunity to build a bridge, not set-off a dynamite charge that destroys it.  I guarantee you that such an approach would have resulted in far more engagement than telling them ""fuck you!"" in the best 15-year-old pimple-faced kid style.<p>I also don't know if those voicing support for the ""fuck you!"" approach on this thread have much business experience.  This is not a put-down, it's just reality.  If you are in your early twenties it might feel like the best approach is this in-your-face-and-very-public approach.  Give it another ten years and a few more cuts and bruises and your opinion is likely to change.<p>Perhaps I've been fortunate.  I got into a very professional work environment from about nineteen years old and never looked back.  I have never --ever-- had to deal with people who treated any other professional in this manner.  Disagreements?  Yes.  Heated debates?  Absolutely.  Going for visceral ad-hominem attacks?  Never.  Bad idea.<p>Don't believe me?  Try it and see how far you get.  Remember, you don't have the rock-star pass card.",1340166219

8330304,comment,8329837,8330200,1,0,asolove,,,"You&#x27;ve hit on the core idea, which is to make all data flow in one direction. Data passes down from the state manager to individual components, and then from those components back through the state manager to then go back and update the UI, etc. The hypothesis is that this is better than a style where you do pervasive two-way binding because you have a single point for managing all your data, validations, errors, undo/redo, etc. which are hard to manage if data changes occur at lower levels and have to be synced.<p>As for how you get the change request from your low-level component to that one place, there are a few options.<p>- Pass callbacks down to lower-level components in their props, as you show.<p>- Pass lower-level components a data structure that knows how to update itself within the larger data structure (a cursor, as used in Om)<p>- Allow components to issue change requests that get interpreted by the state manager.

8330301,comment,8329577,8329957,24,0,plorkyeran,,,"The primary use-case of auto returns is for templated functions where the return type depends on the thing passed in. For example, in C++11 you have to write things like the following:<p><pre><code>    template<typename Range>\n    auto begin(Range& r) -> decltype(r.begin()) {\n        return r.begin();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe return type <i>can&#x27;t</i> be specified by the function[0], and you have to copy and paste the body of the function into the decltype() clause to tell the compiler that the return type is whatever the thing it&#x27;s wrapping returns. When you have some long and complicated expression rather than just r.begin() in the body, this duplication becomes a major issue.<p>[0] In this specific case you could require that Range have an iterator typedef and return that, but that approach does not generalize.",1410965910

Distinct polymer tags are attached to each of the four nucleotides poised to contribute to a single molecule of replicating DNA. As they react, the tags are released near a protein layer full of tiny holes called nanopores. Each tag blocks the flow of electrical ions across the layer in a different way. Because it relies on electronics rather than optics, nanopore sequencing promises faster, cheaper sequencing. Dr Church holds up a fingernail-sized chip containing 128,000 nanopores that he reckons will bring the cost of sequencing down to $100.

You want to choose co-founders that are linearly-independent in skill-space and maximize the magnitude of each of the desired components over time.

8330011,comment,8328206,8328946,3,0,bane,,,"> without having any other deleterious effects<p>And I guess that&#x27;s the problem isn&#x27;t it? It does have deleterious effects, but within the narrow definition of &quot;freedom&quot; the GPL uses, those effects are unimportant/ignored. The long-term vision of the GPL does provide a kind of &quot;freedom&quot; along it&#x27;s specific definition, but strongly denies all other kinds along the way.<p>It&#x27;s like saying &quot;drinking alcohol is unhealthy&quot; and citing cases of drunk driving and alcoholism as examples of this. And then narrowly defining &quot;healthy&quot; narrowly to include only lifestyles where no alcohol is consumed. Then completely ignoring and even actively working against all the ways in which alcohol can be healthy (and even healthier than no alcohol at all) because it doesn&#x27;t fit into the narrow definition of &quot;healthy&quot;.<p>So when somebody says &quot;remind me how the GNU Public Health Handbook keeps me healthy&quot;, when it&#x27;s brought up that moderate alcohol consumption can increase various health factors and longevity...in other words that alcohol consumption can be &quot;compatible&quot; with health...it&#x27;s the same kind of scenario here.<p>The GPL&#x27;s fixation with its specific ideological pure and completely arbitrary definition of &quot;freedom&quot; does not represent all kinds of freedom and that it purports to represent some kind of maximal freedom state is highly disingenuous at best and outright lying at worst. There are certain exercises of freedom that provide for better outcomes within certain criteria than anything the GPL offers and without certain deleterious effects that come from the GPL. But the GPL philosophy either acts like those shouldn&#x27;t exist or are evil. And I find that highly spurious.<p>There is no such thing as consequence-free freedom. There&#x27;s always a trade-off of some kind. The GPL is a fiction that comes from a fantasy that this isn&#x27;t the case and just like any philosophy that relies on ideological purity conveniently ignores the cases where the ideology has negative consequences.",1410962967

I can be incredibly social and am prone to frenzies of activity that cause many to think of me as an extroverted person.

You can&#x27;t just make economic measurements up out of whole cloth and ignore entire industries.<p>&quot;To prove there are problems with the official CPI, Schiff calculated the price changes of a basket of 20 goods that consist of common household purchases. Schiff’s CPI basket of 20 goods included: eggs, new cars, milk, gasoline, bread, rent for a primary residence, coffee, dental services, potatoes, electricity, sugar, airline tickets, butter, store-purchased beer, apples, public transportation, cereal, tires, beef, and prescription drugs.&quot;<p>Things in the CPI ( <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm</a> ) that he ignores:<p>1) People who purchase homes, which is the majority. 60+% of people own rather than rent.<p><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-29/u-s-homeownership-rate-falls-to-lowest-in-19-years.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-29/u-s-homeownership-r...</a><p>So we throw out 60% of housing data [31% of the total basket] because he says so?

That is 32% of the CPI basket he ignores now.<p>3) Medical services? Everyone needs those, he ignores those. That is another 5.8% of the CPI measure he ignores and pretends doesn&#x27;t exist with his made up bullshit. That is 37.8% of normal household expenditures he now ignores.<p>4) He ignores <i>CLOTHING</i> for fuck&#x27;s sake. That brings us up to 40.1% of the CPI basket he ignores. You are apparently naked.<p>5) He ignores the difference between eating out vs. eating in. We are up to 45.8%. No one ever eats out. Ever. Clearly, this is true. You&#x27;ve never eaten in a restaurant.<p>6) He ignores Tobacco (included in the CPI). This puts up to about 46.5% of real world purchases by households you are ignoring.<p>So just to reiterate in Schiff (and your) reality:<p>1) You are naked.<p>2) You do not eat out.<p>3) You do not use the gas utilities.<p>4) You do not change the oil in your car.<p>5) You do not own a home.<p>6) You never utilize a physician or hospital.<p>7) You don&#x27;t use tobacco.<p>I don&#x27;t know how you can take Schiff seriously if you do any of those 7 things.

Apostrophes look like a reasonable compromise because lots of calculators already use apostrophes to separate digits:<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=14+digit+calculator&source=lnms&tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=14+digit+calculator&source=l...</a>",1410962609

8329965,comment,8327307,8327307,1,0,kator,,,"I used to hang out at a &quot;Radio Shack Computer Store&quot; in high school.  One day the manager said a businessman was coming in to see the TRS-80 Model 16 he had on the floor and that he had no idea what to show him.  I had been playing with it for a while (tricked him into giving me root) and I hooked up a couple of TTY&#x27;s to it and setup the accounting software they had on the shelf with some dummy data.  The customer came in, I demo&#x27;d it all to him showed him how someone could change a customer on one terminal and the person on another terminal would see the change.  He bought it on the spot.  The total was $20,000 with all the parts, TTY&#x27;s, terminals and everything.  Needless to say from that day forward the manager of that computer store gave me free reign.  I could order anything from the catalog they didn&#x27;t have on the floor and as soon as it came in I&#x27;d set it up and play with it and then connect it to the floor setup.  I&#x27;d demo using multiple printers (A/B for Dot Matrix -vs- Daisy Wheel) and other cool features.  Over a time I started getting requests to help people set this stuff up in their offices and that lead to my first business when I was in 10th grade.<p>I keep thinking RS could join forces with someone like Adafruit and create this same thing around the Maker movement.  That said, I&#x27;m not sure the retail space and labor costs plus insurance would pay off, it would be a tricky model.  But if somehow they could capture and bottle up this sort of thing for the next generation of technologists and do it at a scale that paid the bills they&#x27;d be back in the pole position on a massive trend.<p>However, with online purchases and AdaFruit being able to deliver stuff to me in time for my &quot;weekend hardware time&quot; I&#x27;m not sure there is a place for this in the malls of America.  It would require a massive cash infusion and a complete redesign from top down of incentives and management to even get a crack at it.  Perhaps someone with the money will buy the name and retail space and gut the rest and try a shot at it.  That said I think stuff like TechShop [1] might already be headed there and they&#x27;re aware of the challenges of cost of space and having the right vibe for hackers.<p>It&#x27;s easy to underestimate just how insanely expensive retail space is in a mall, plus having labor, insurance and marketing costs it would be hard to justify selling parts against companies that have 1/10th the cost in their business models.  In order for RS to succeed it would need to focus on the personal one on one wonder and discovery experience.  That&#x27;s harder then it sounds to staff and execute against and maintain margins to support the costs to operate the business.  If I had the capital to fund it I&#x27;d love to take a run at something like this but it would have to be a big change and most likely the best route would be to take them private so you can make brutal sweeping changes rapidly and get the right kind of people in along with rebuilding the culture and the branding.  Even after all that it would require a burn rate on a daily basis that would equal what some startups spend in a year.  I’m not sure you could make the argument that it would be money well spent.  If I were going long and had the capital I’d love to dig in and work out the model but the scale of this thing will most likely never allow the kind of entrepreneurial sprit it needs to be revived unless Elon Musk is bored and wants to back it, but I think he’s a bit busy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.techshop.ws/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techshop.ws/</a>",1410962606

Argos does sell a significant proportion of the stuff you can buy in Maplin—blank media, HDMI cables, electronic goods, even computers—for all it also sells many other things which don&#x27;t overlap with Maplin&#x27;s stock. Of course none of these rivals is in the same market niche as Maplin (or Radio Shack): if Maplin and Radio Shack were being beaten down by companies in the same niche then it&#x27;s unlikely that anyone would be questioning whether that niche is still viable at all.<p>The online maker-shops may even be aiding Maplin in some respects, as they&#x27;ve helped to create and make popular new product lines like Arduino shields and RasPis which Maplin has been able to bring to the high street.<p>So while Maplin does have issues to face, it appears to be profitable (it&#x27;s even been expanding recently) while facing similar competitive pressures to today&#x27;s Radio Shack. Thus if Radio Shack is bombing in roughly the same niche as Maplin, it&#x27;s presumably down to inferior management (or maybe debt load) rather than the niche itself being unviable.",1410962418

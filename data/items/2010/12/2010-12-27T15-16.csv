The dissatisfaction we experience is a drive to accomplish more and drive the continued betterment of our race; the acquisitions and ""keeping up with the Joneses"" drive our productivity. There are perverse incentives, of course, to maximize our pay while minimizing our work. But at some point, to buy a $10,000 72"" Plasma LED HDMI Gigajoule Laser TV, one must have done (or at least been around for) $10,000 worth of work.<p>Now, maybe Dilbert's dissatisfaction with his lot in life doesn't drive his productivity. Geeks are wont to build cool stuff for the sake of building cool stuff. Maybe I'm overanalyzing something that we should just laugh at. But as They Might Be Giants sang, ""No one in the world ever gets what they want, and that is beautiful. Everybody dies frustrated and sad, and that is beautiful."" Beautiful not because tragic sadness is good in and of itself, but because by striving to overcome our endless frustration, we guarantee our progeny a better quality of life.",1293465227

The opinion was in large part based on the ""fundamental similarities between email and traditional forms of communication"" [2].  Having established that the 4th amendment does indeed apply to email, the question is how the 4th amendment works between spouses. In Burdeau v. McDowell the Supreme Court ruled that ""the origin and history [of the Fourth Amendment] clearly show that it was intended as a restraint upon the activities of sovereign authority, and was not intended to be a limitation upon other than governmental agencies"" [3].  Further, in the Supreme Court ruled that (emphasis mine) ""[the Fourth Amendment] does not apply to a search or seizure, <i>even an unreasonable one</i>, effected by a private individual not acting as an agent of the Government or with the participation or knowledge of any governmental official.""

I seriously doubt this will stick.<p>I have a friend who is politically active around a certain cause -- the details are not important -- and I've noticed that he receives an ""update"" every day or two with the most outlandish sorts of news. Of course, in a country of 300+ million, odds are something unusual are going on every day. To read the accounts as he does suggests there is some vast conspiracy at work. But to take an honest look at the numbers just shows that, given the randomness of people's behavior, every once in a million times something happens that would piss him off. The rest is just a result of the large number of people and the efficiency of the reporting systems involved.<p>So I'm assuming that new law isn't being explored, and this is just another example of this phenomenon I've noticed with my friend. What I'm interested in, however, is how the prosecutor came up with the idea to criminally charge him? Did the wife file criminal charges on her own (which I suspect)?

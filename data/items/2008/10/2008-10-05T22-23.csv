Still, buying expensive aluminum billets and then turning ~99% of the material into chips as would happen with a case design similar to the current MBP wouldn't be very efficient.<p>Perhaps they are moving to case designs that are a combination of CNC machined parts and stamped pieces? I'm sure Apple's design team is a lot more imaginative than me. There are some CNC-looking parts in the current MBP like the bracket that fixes the HD in place.<p>But let's face facts. Steve will not rest until he is selling Cube shaped computers again. :)",1223247334

When you can't effectively measure the effectiveness of each ad dollar or you don't have a meaningful or differentiating product, I guess you take what you can get.  Even ""I don't like X"" is advertising for X.  I think this says more about the advertisers and the products than the ads or the consumers though.",1223247123

It scales, and is solid.<p>Sure, if you're just putting up something that needs quick prototyping then java is probably overkill, but if you're writing something quite complex, java can do a great job.<p>I think the ""golden bullet"" for startups is having a good programmer with a passion for something. Language isn't so relevant IMHO.<p>(Mibbit currently handles around 3.5million visits a month on a single VPS in java which I'm pretty happy with).",1223246061

324399,comment,324035,324184,0,0,walterk,,,"The very article you link to carefully distinguishes Rand's definition of selfishness from the common understanding of the word.  Rand was herself against the base selfishness that most people are against.<p>The problem is that pure free markets allow those operating from base selfishness to prosper.  You need a credible threat to keep these people in line.  Rand perhaps hoped that an Atlas Shrugged style revolt of ""prime movers"" could provide that threat, but (1) it's much too blunt, (2) relies on Rand's simplistic view that humans are either ethical and productive or looters (which allows her to justify the consequences of that revolt), and (3) has very little chance of actually happening.  Which means turning to the state to provide the necessary threat, compromising the cherished ideal of completely free markets. The state may operate imperfectly, and require an ever-vigilant electorate to ensure that it does not overstep its bounds and is constantly improving its methods in accordance with a well-specified set of metrics (which is true of just about any government function), but it's better than letting businesspeople run amok in the name of purity.",1223245675

324397,comment,324315,324355,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"What you and this post are talking about is transitioning toward being an intelligence service, not an all you can eat info buffet.<p>The Economist provides actionable intelligence on what's happening in the world.  It truly is ""news you can use.""<p>Example: Back when I was applying to be a CIA agent (i pulled out after passing the first few steps) the interviewers routinely told me to read the Economist from cover to cover.  The CIA considers it the definitive, authoritative consumer news product, full of information you can act on.<p>Same with the other example mentioned here, Consumer Reports.<p>That said, even if that's where newspapers go, they're still overstaffed.  You don't need 1,000 reporters to break down what's happening in Chicago that week in a useful way.<p>The link economy that Jeff Jarvis blogs about so much (BuzzMachine.com - a must-read for people interested in the future of news) means you don't need as many people to re-report all the stuff your competitor reported.<p>Over at my humble Chicago news startup, I'm laying the groundwork for what I believe is the next sustainable metro news model.<p>Three pieces:
1.  A crowd-powered, local link aggregator.  Digg for Chicago, to be succinct.  Open-source your tip line. Let your readers vote up, discuss and share neat, weird and important local links.<p>2.  A blog network.  Stick 2-3 local experts on every topic that newspapers typically assign beat reporters to.  Have them aggregate, comment and contextualize 2-3 times a week. Create conversations around hot topics.  We started a blog about Lollapalooza over the summer and posted to it just for 4-days.  It was a big hit for us and was noticed by every news organization covering the festival.<p>3.  Hard-hitting, impactful reporting/features that draw on what's hot from the link aggregator and the blogs.  Once a week we publish something that you absolutely have to know to stay ahead of the conversation.  To use blogger lingo, this should be linkbait of the highest caliber.<p>Anyway, I agree with the assessment in this article.  You can either go low-brow (The Chicago Tribune now has a CollegeHumor-style blog that their interns run...it's awful) or you can go high.",1223245653

College is a mechanism where mediocre minds fight for status, publishing and tenure like dogs over scraps and ensure the most brilliant people are reduced to a low common denominator, and train people to approach life like children even when they are growing up.<p>If you aren't 100% certain you need to be in school to do what you want with your life, start the company.  Learning is awesome, schooling functions as a mechanism of control to make sure the really smart people don't learn so fast that they live up to their potential.",1223245150
324393,comment,324295,324310,0,0,mdasen,,,"Slashdot can get a little heavy on the FOSS evangelism, but I think it's fair to say the company is being underhanded.<p>Think of it this way: the company wants to hire him because of the open source project.  To rephrase: the open source project got him that job.  As such, it is logical that the open source project could get him other jobs in the future - possibly several.  By agreeing to a non-compete on that project, he is agreeing that it will never be a selling point for his future employment since he can never work on that code again.<p>I'm perfectly fine with developers spending their time on closed source projects.  I'm perfectly fine with a company demanding that their code stay proprietary.  What I think is crazy is a company demanding that you give up what got you the job with them.<p>That is, unless this is being treated as an acquisition.  As such, the author should be entitled to a sweet buyout deal.  But that isn't the case here.  The author is being ladened with the conditions that should apply to a buyout deal without the buyout payoff.  If you founded a company and produced proprietary code and another company came along and wanted it, you'd ask for a buyout (of your company, of that project, whatever).  Pay day!  Here, the company wants that kind of control without paying for it.  Not ok.",1223245073

I'd rather say ""fuck that"" and do what I want.<p>It's not a lack of money that would make me kill myself (and I don't drink alcohol, preferring drugs that enhance cognition).  It's a lack of meaning.  As long as I can write books, papers on ideas that interest me, or work on my patentable inventions, my life has meaning regardless of the money situation.  But, if I'm spending my time worrying if I have tucked away my pellets as good as the neighbors, my life has no interest, and, at that point, why not get off the ride instead of spinning the wheel for no good reason?",1223244725

If anyone wanted to get hold of me, they could still reach me via my work email address, telephone, or Facebook.<p>I'm slightly more worried that they could lose all my past emails - in which case there would be very little I could do to get any sort of redress from them - but I'm pretty confident that I'm more likely to lose my own data than Google.

In my experience most people want to help in some way when confronted with homelessness, but they don' know what to do.  Rarely do they wish to hand over cash.  Rarely do they wish to have a conversation and understand the situation.  Many are interested in aiding programs which empower homeless people to dig out of their situation.

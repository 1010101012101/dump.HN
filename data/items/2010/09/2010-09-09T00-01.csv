How would socialized healthcare improve the economy overall?<p>""Policies that generate more widely shared prosperity lead to stronger and more sustainable economic growth - and that’s good for everyone. The rich are better off with a smaller percentage of a fast-growing economy than a larger share of an economy that’s barely moving.""<p>A.k.a. the author is saying that ""spreading the wealth"" (known by some as socialism) is good because it takes away money from the rich and gives it to the poor. If the author just embraced that on its own, that's fine- the author is a Socialist, and that's just an opinion. But the author argues that the poor will then spend it, which will increase revenue to companies, which will create more jobs. This is the opposite approach as the Trickle-down Economics of the Reagan era, but suffers the same problem of assuming that any group (rich, middle-class, or poor) will spend during a down economy if the government gives them money (directly via tax breaks or via various programs, etc.). The fact is <i>no one</i> spends during a down economy.<p>Instead what the government should do is to do as much as they can to be supportive of businesses of all sizes (even individuals) while working to stabilize the economy, pay down our national debt, and promote education and research. Then and only then will our economy recover.",1283993883

Love the name, by the way - ""Quirk"" for a QR code company is very memorable.<p>A few suggestions:<p>1)  Agree with the other posters about an explanation on the home page.<p>2)  The process by which I had to choose a permalink was confusing - why do I need to choose a permalink before I get my quirk?  It would be way more dramatic to have the QR code pop up immediately after I FB connect.  This could also help with (1) - you could caption it ""This is your personal QR code!""<p>3)  With FB Connect, you can import not just name, but profile photo and other public data.  I'd expect you to generate a profile page at my permalink seeded with that information.<p>4)  Obviously, the mobile apps are pretty key.  I sent the QR code to my phone via text (I like that feature, btw).  But pretty soon it will get buried in my SMS inbox.  I need a way to pull it up immediately, like a Quirk app would do.<p>5)  I like the idea of getting conference organizers to embed quirk codes in name cards.  But before I would actually do that, I'd probably want:<p>a) Really good profiles at the permalinks<p>b) Customization / branding.  It's my conference so I want to promote myself, not getaquirk.com.

After 3-4 years, a startup will either succeed or fold. Because the <i>timeframe is bounded</i>, it's possible for a founder to forgo any personal savings without irreparably damaging their personal finances.<p>For example, speaking for myself, at my last job I was saving about $60,000 per year. Not contributing that money to my savings over the next 3-4 years isn't a huge deal. If my startup fails, I've only lost 3 or 4 years of savings.<p>However, it IS a huge deal for our STARTUP to save $60,000 per year. That's a full-time junior employee. If not spending that money increases the likelihood of a successful exit, then it's a prudent financial strategy for me. The effect is multiplied if the other cofounders forgo their savings as well.<p>Note that this is only my second VC-backed startup.

Both will exit dramatically further along, hyper-focused, and with higher valuations (in my experience). Companies that are unicorns or growing like crazy or have crazy utility get even higher valuations, and it all works out pretty well.<p>IMO standard deal makes things incredible simple and easy on the front end, without the massive majority of potential pitfalls (signaling, jealousy, negotiating time, etc)",1398196797

Recently they threw some fuel on the fire and started e-mailing to remind us which roles were open, and started having an employee to hire of the month program. Finally they&#x27;ve added in things like any referrel which even comes in for an interview gets you entered into a monthly drawing for an iPad.<p>My only problem is I have no network! I don&#x27;t have a facebook. I constantly prune numbers from my phone if I don&#x27;t talk to people.

What we have are implementations.<p>This is not merely nitpicking. Any turing-complete language can be interpreted or compiled. Language specs tend to make one side easier, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that Python cannot be compiled (and it is actually compiled to bytecode).  You can have something similar to a GIL in a compiled language too.<p>One of the things that makes it easier to increase performance is having type declarations. This makes it much easier for the compiler to reason about the code, which <i>can</i> lead to increased efficiency. But optional type annotations can accomplish just as much.",1398196739

This being the case, it doesn&#x27;t sound like a smart playlist would solve the &quot;shuffle&quot; problem of jumping from (e.g.) one piece&#x27;s third movement to another piece&#x27;s second, any more than any other sort of playlist does.<p>If I can define a smart playlist whose members are other <i>playlists</i>, of course, that&#x27;s a different matter, and I&#x27;ll have to take a look and see whether I actually can do that. It doesn&#x27;t seem too likely, though; as I said elsewhere, I&#x27;m not sure why the idea of a playlist containing other playlists is so apparently strange to music player implementers, but I&#x27;ve yet to find anything with the capability.

Most of their drivers/protocols are file-based. TrueCrypt is block-based, i.e. all data is stored as a single potentially giant file. This affects the performance of algorithms focused on caching and deduplication.<p>3. I designed Safe to be much easier than TrueCrypt to use. Try making a new encrypted disk with TrueCrypt, then do the same process with Safe and you&#x27;ll see what I mean. TrueCrypt is very intimidating to set up for people who don&#x27;t intimately understand how cryptography works. Safe just chooses the most secure defaults.<p>As for your second concern about caching. I can guarantee that no data is cached to the local disk unencrypted when using Safe. Don&#x27;t just take my word for it, verify yourself. See <a href=""http://www.getsafe.org/about#system_changes_more_info"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getsafe.org/about#system_changes_more_info</a><p>Safe is not a competitor to TrueCrypt. They are different tools for different situations. I use both depending on the nature of the data I&#x27;m keeping private. Safe is another tool in this ecosystem and the main goal is to help more people take control of how their data is stored and transmitted and hopefully bootstrap mainstream digital privacy awareness.",1398195785
7629915,story,,,1,0,john_owens,"Ask HN: email client functionality: how to keep track of follow-up emails?",,"Greetings, I would like the following functionality for my email client, and welcome ideas and suggestions!<p>I send a lot of email that I hope will be answered. Occasionally I don’t get an answer, and I’d like to follow up if that’s the case. What I could do is keep track of every email that I send as a todo item, and then check off that todo item when I get a reply. But the common case is that I do get a reply, and I’d like to optimize for that case; I’d be doing a lot of bookkeeping otherwise. I’d only like reminders when I don’t get a reply.<p>My ideal system would allow me to send an email and set some sort of reminder (perhaps cc: another address?) that reminds me in a designated amount of time <i>only if I don’t get a reply</i>. Currently there are services like followup.cc that partially fit the bill: I can cc: a message to 1w@followup.cc and in a week, I’ll get an email reminder. But, followup.cc has no access to my mail stream and can’t watch for replies; what I’d <i>like</i> instead is something that watches my mail stream for Message-IDs and <i>only</i> reminds me at the designated time if it hasn’t seen the initiating Message-ID.<p>Any pointers to anything like this / thoughts on how I could implement it? I am on OS X; I use the emacs mailer &quot;Wanderlust&quot; primarily, but Mail.app runs in the background, so my backup plan is writing it in AppleScript and running it in Mail.app, I suppose. I don’t have access to procmail, which might have fit the bill as well.<p>Erik Hetzner on the Wanderlust list suggested using imapfilter; the fine folks at indev (power tools for OS X Mail.app) suggested the following: http://support.indev.ca/discussions/suggestions/1590-query-for-functionality-keeping-track-of-follow-up-emails-does-your-product-do-anything-like-this",1398195776

I grant that this does not constitute a primary source; on the other hand, my reading of the relevant history gives me no reason to find the claim at all incredible. Perhaps your understanding of history suggests otherwise. If so, you would do well to detail that understanding in order to support the claim you&#x27;re making, rather than persisting in your attempts to discredit my statements by means of blatant <i>ad hominem</i>.<p>You seem to be reading a great deal into my statements on the subject. A more objective reading of those statements will reveal that I have uttered no more praise for Vladimir Putin than merely that he has consistently acted in Russia&#x27;s interests, as is the minimal obligation of any head of state toward his nation. That&#x27;s more or less what I&#x27;ve said about those from the West who have purported to act on Russia&#x27;s behalf in recent history, as well; while I grant some of them acted in accord with their claimed motivations, others have acted in accord with their own interests and without regard to those of Russia, a claim which seems to me rather trivially defensible.<p>I am a citizen of the United States, and I have no particular love for Russia beyond the basic respect which any citizen of one sovereign nation may reasonably be expected to extend to another.

With net/http, you end up with a lot of coupling: your end handler needs to know about every layer of middleware above it, and you start losing a lot of the benefit of having middleware in the first place. With an explicit middleware stack and a universal interface for middleware contexts, this is easy: everyone can code to the same single context object, and instead of standardizing on weird bound variables (or a global locked map a la gorilla), you just need to standardize on a single string key and a type.<p>I think my ideal world would involve Go providing a map[string]interface{} as part of the http.Request struct in order to implement this behavior, but until we get that, I think Goji&#x27;s web.C (&quot;the context object&quot;) is the next best thing.<p>There&#x27;s one other thing pat hacks around: the issue of how to pass bound URL variables to the resulting handler.

The whole reason for using it is that you don&#x27;t know what you want beforehand.<p>With TDD you write a failing test, write the smallest amount of code necessary to make it pass, then refactor. After that you add another test and go round again. You can use this to drive your design for low level unit/model tests.<p>When writing higher level acceptance tests I like to write the tests in using the language you share with the customer [1]. If you do this then they should remain valid unless the requirements change, they should not be dependent on your understanding of the requirement. To achieve this you can have your tests manipulate a domain model. If you are not testing your model then you need a model for your tests. e.g. something like the page object pattern for webdriver[0].<p>This means you can sketch out your high level tests rapidly with a stub model, and then implement the mapping to your implementation once you have got the implementation more stable.<p>Adding a layer of indirection to the implementation like this also means you can refactor your implementation as much as you like without touching the test itself. You may need to modify the mapping between the language your tests use and the implementation as you change the implementation. This sort of test can be valid across major re-writes of the implementation. The tests should also be less brittle. If you change something that several tests interact with you should only need to update one place to fix it.<p>For integration tests I like to use the same approach, except now the language used relates to the common concepts across the two systems you are testing integration of.

Some corrections can be done in software these days (barrel/pincushion distortion, chromatic aberration), but not all.<p>What they&#x27;ve been able to do with this camera is move a lot of those corrections into software, allowing them to use a simpler, cheaper lens with a very large aperture. The constant F/2 aperture is unheard of in a lens with such a large zoom range.<p>Besides aberrations, there&#x27;s another issue with using traditional large-aperture lenses: focusing takes time, and it&#x27;s not always accurate. With the Lytro, I imagine that you can take pictures instantly without needing to focus, and you can get perfect focus in post-processing.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen in the sample gallery, image quality isn&#x27;t great compared to regular camera/lens combinations in the same price range.

Anything containing a unique element has to be logically unique itself, right?<p>In C++, which defaults to value semantics, it&#x27;s required that you move your container if it contains a non-copyable (unique) element. So you only need to move <i>into</i> the draw_all function in this case, which is why taking the range by value is not just efficient, but semantically correct. If the caller moves in to the function, then when it returns the caller will no longer own any elements. The callers vector will be empty, and the elements themselves will still be unique having never been copied, moved or &quot;borrowed&quot;.<p>If borrowing isn&#x27;t a performance hack, then why not make everything you&#x27;re ever likely to borrow shared? I&#x27;d argue anything you&#x27;re drawing is <i>shared</i> between the draw routine and the caller. Drawing a distinction just because the caller is suspended, seems like an impediment to future change if, for example, you later switch to a coroutine or an asynchronous/threaded operation. Copying the range and sharing elements gets you this for free.<p>In summary, &#x27;draw_all&#x27; as specified was a bad API because:<p>* It restricted the type of range/container passed to it<p>* It had unnatural ownership semantics (borrowing a box of unique things without saying you&#x27;re borrowing those things is weird).<p>* The implementation, as was, required further borrows which were only implied.

If Go had support for method overloading, its entire interface is type-safe. In contrast, Martini does a lot of magical object injection, and it&#x27;s not clear until runtime if your routes will even work, or what they&#x27;ll even do, or where exactly the memory for them is coming from.<p>Second, I much prefer Goji&#x27;s way of defining middleware. To me, middleware is like an onion (just like ogres!): each layer is a wrapper around the previous one. The way you write middleware in net/http is by wrapping the old http.Handler with a new one, and that&#x27;s how I wanted Goji&#x27;s middleware to work too. There&#x27;s no magic &quot;context.Next()&quot;, there&#x27;s no magic dependency injection overrides, it&#x27;s just http.Handlers all the way down.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;d like to know if you think I&#x27;m right: again, I&#x27;m really not sure this is actually better than Martini (or $YOUR_FAVORITE_FRAMEWORK), but I think it comes from a slightly different set of principles, and ones that I think are worth considering.",1398193579

There&#x27;s a full spectrum here.  But if <i>some</i> of your hobbies/leisure time relates to your work, you&#x27;re going to be more valuable to an employer (assuming that doesn&#x27;t get unhealthy).  It&#x27;s great if it&#x27;s tangential, too.  It&#x27;s not about logging extra hours, it&#x27;s about what gives you joy.  Writing code could be one thing.  Reading about new tech could be another.  Or reading about related skills (management, design, marketing).  If you truly love it, a higher percentage of your work time will be enjoyable, too (which means more productivity and better retention).<p>I certainly don&#x27;t blame anyone for having a diverse life.  But I have two great candidates, I&#x27;ll always choose the one who loves their discipline enough that the read about it and noodle with it on the side.",1398193217

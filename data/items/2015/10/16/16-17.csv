I can remember clearly, in junior high school, the librarian informing us that we were only allowed to copy six pages of a book for homework assignments. I don&#x27;t really have a strong opinion on much of this (one way or the other), because I&#x27;m not well enough informed on the topic, but I remember feeling weird about it, becaus the library aid made us feel like criminals for wanting to copy more than 6 pages. The library at that particular school was pretty substandard anyway.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure I won&#x27;t be aging myself by saying this, but I feel very nostalgic about libraries, and the thought of them becoming obsolete saddens me, not so much because I can&#x27;t imagine a future with mostly digital books, but because I always felt at home at the library (and not in the &quot;there&#x27;s a man sleeping under the 600s shelf&quot; sort of way). I always felt a sort of wonderment at the library, and that others were there for the same reason added to that. I didn&#x27;t visit the public library for school reasons, typically. Instead, I just sort of explored. I have always been a slow reader, so finding the exact right thing to read next was a bigger deal for me than just reading book after book.<p>I also volunteered as library aid in 12th grade, which was fun.<p>Are there others that feel / felt the same about libraries?",1445014087

Every cable tie, connector, all thermal and electrical insulation, every screw and panel, literally <i>everything</i> has to be extensively tested and their performance under a wide variety of conditions has to be completely mapped out.<p>For example, the last satellite I was involved in (NuStar, orbital xray telescope) which was designed mid to late 2000s, the PIs didn&#x27;t even bother reviewing SSDs (Still at least a decade before they&#x27;re used in critical missions) and hard drives were passed because no one wanted to risk our first xray telescope in decades, which happened to be several orders of magnitude more powerful than anything we&#x27;ve ever had in that spectrum.

I&#x27;ve had interviews when I&#x27;ve tried to clarify whether I need to do things a certain way or provide something like unit tests, and met with the response &quot;I don&#x27;t know - do <i>you</i> think that&#x27;s the kind of thing you should do?&quot; If you get this as a candidate, the best solution is to talk a briefly about what you&#x27;d do in a real-world scenario (where you have context, tools, connectivity, time and teammates). If that doesn&#x27;t reveal anything, explicitly state an assumption and why you&#x27;re making it and move on.<p>If you give technical interviews, I implore you: when the candidate asks what you want from them, don&#x27;t be coy or sneaky about it with the justification that figuring it out is part of the interview. <i>Tell the candidate what you want.</i> If what you want them to do is role-play a scenario where they extract requirements from you, tell them so.

If I&#x27;d done a better job showing people, or if I&#x27;d given them something to play with, then words would&#x27;ve been unnecessary.  We&#x27;re all in it together.  Part of the challenge is making everyone feel like they can do great things.<p><i>Is a &quot;gut feeling&quot; enough?</i><p>Counter-intuitively, it seems like the answer is yes, for two reasons: (a) It prevents me from fooling myself.  If I say &quot;Look how beautiful this design is,&quot; people will push back if most disagree.  (b) If young people don&#x27;t want to build cool stuff with Lisp, then that&#x27;s alarming to someone who intends to grow Lisp, as I do.  And young people turn out to be the most likely to vocalize a negative gut reaction.<p>The trick is to be aware when (a) happens, but to brush it off if you&#x27;re right and the world is wrong.  It&#x27;s as hard as it sounds.<p>I usually run the language past some friends and tell them to be as cynical as possible, then think of ways their critique is justified.  The discoveries from that process have been so cool.  For example, the outermost parens of a Lisp expression are unnecessary:<p><pre><code>  (def even (x)\n    (is (mod x 2) 0))\n</code></pre>\nshould read<p><pre><code>  def even (x)\n    (is (mod x 2) 0)\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s obvious once it&#x27;s pointed out, but I was the least likely to realize it.  &quot;What&#x27;s with the parens?  I actually like them, but why do you put in the extra ones?&quot;  &quot;What extra ones?&quot;<p>Whether it&#x27;s a good idea to formally drop them is a different question, but now I know to check.  It&#x27;d break all existing Lisp auto-indent plugins.  But that could be worthwhile; it depends.<p>User testing has been pretty great.",1445013201

The researchers found that the problem is that a lot of sites use the same p values, and the ones they use are too small, so that there is a single calculation that a government can do which allows them to break DH that uses those particular p values. Although this calculation is phenomenally expensive, it seems likely that NSA did it several years ago.<p>a and b are private and must remain secret. Commonly a different a and b are chosen each time Diffie-Hellman is used (like for each new connection or session with an Internet service).<p>Diffie-Hellman provides a property called forward secrecy because it allows two ends of a connection to derive a <i>session key</i> (which gets calculated using information derived from g, p, a, and b, and gets then used as a key for some other cryptosystem, normally some form of AES today, but in theory it could be anything) but then later &quot;forget&quot; what the session key was and how it was derived. Unlike other ways of doing key exchange, when the parties choose to &quot;forget&quot; their session key and associated information this way, they no longer have a way to recover or reconstruct it!<p>This is useful because, for example, if someone hacks the computer of someone who was using protocols with ephemeral DH, the computer likely won&#x27;t contain information that could be used to reconstruct the session key and decrypt old communications.

Last year [six years ago, as I paste this], when I went to have another look at the eBook on my latest computer (not the one I originally purchased the book on), I found that it no longer worked: I could not enable the book on my new computer because Amazon&#x27;s license server for Adobe eBooks no longer worked. It took me several back-and-forth emails with Amazon&#x27;s customer support to get someone to admit that once Amazon moved over to the Kindle, support for the Adobe ebooks went away (most of them didn&#x27;t even seem to be aware that there were eBooks prior to the Kindle). I&#x27;d have settled for them replacing my eBook with the Kindle equivalent, but I don&#x27;t own a Kindle. At the time there was no Kindle eBook reader for OS X. I eventually got a refund, but it took a lot of work to get them to even recognize that there was a problem. Additionally, I didn&#x27;t want a refund, I wanted to read the special content in this special version of the book, one that is not available in paper. Given that experience, I&#x27;m a bit reluctant to purchase the Kindle version, even though there is apparently an OS X reader now.<p>I think the thing that most disturbs me about this whole incident is not just that a book I bought stopped working it is that I had no indication that it had become unavailable to me until the instant I went to re-read it. It had probably been inaccessible for months if not years without me knowing, with me thinking that I had the book ready for me to go read whenever I felt like, but when I went to check on something, it just didn&#x27;t work. My shelves of paper books don&#x27;t present me with that kind of problem.<p>NOTE that when I bought this ebook I registered it to my email address.  They HAD my email address, and could have sent me an alert when the server&#x27;s retirement was imminent, so I would have a chance to at least authorize my book on my current crop of devices.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1333441"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1333441</a>",1445012182

Recruiter is CV harvesting with fake job ads - experienced that<p>3. Recruiter bait and switches - job is real but is an excuse to get you for something else<p>4. Recruiter gets wind of big company or gov organisation recruiting via competition, posts the same job spec then uses it to try and undercut while passing themselves off as the &quot;official&quot; recruiter. Had this with a NHS development role where the job I responded to turns out they had no business advertising for.<p>5. If the company is named then it&#x27;s usually because said company only wants to use a recruiter. I&#x27;ve had this a couple of times where I&#x27;ve contacted a company directly but been asked to file my application with their official outsourced recruitment service.<p>6. Recruiter threatens &quot;you&#x27;ll never work in this town again&quot; if you do somehow get to know who the company is simply because you ask.<p>Ninety nine percent of all recruiters I have dealt with have been the scum of the earth, even the so called reputable ones.<p>I truly hope Stackoverflow Careers destroys these businesses.",1445011368

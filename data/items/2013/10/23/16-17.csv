Why has no one developed a disinfectant spray that hospitals can apply ad-nauseum (pun intended, the smell ideally wouldn&#x27;t make people nauseous) all over the hospital?  Or, do I not understand the vectors properly?<p>The way I perceive these stories is that hospitals are actually extremely dirty on a microbial level (as is most of the world), it&#x27;s just counter-intuitive because I think a lot of people take for granted that a hospital is imagined to be a super sterile place.  MRSAs could potentially reside on every surface; an act as simple as touching a bed railing could get you infected.  You then have patients in recovery with healing wounds/depressed immune systems, which need antibiotic treatment of some kind when they have an infection.  But it&#x27;s not like you cannot become infected by a MRSA outside of a hospital, you can, and the same antibiotics won&#x27;t work effectively for you just as they don&#x27;t work effectively in the hospital.

6599977,comment,6599040,6599040,6,0,hooande,,,"One thing I learned from watching this episode of Frontline was that we aren&#x27;t doing a lot of research into new antibiotics. Companies like Pfizer (the original makers of penicillin) would rather create drugs like Lipitor or Prozac, things that customers will take everyday for the rest of their lives. Antibiotics are intended to be used as sparingly as possible, which doesn&#x27;t leave room for a lot of profit. Even the National Institute of Health has but antibiotic research on the back burner to pursue more pressing concerns.<p>The other big problem we face is that certain antibiotics are like steroids for farm animals. I believe that they kill the bacteria in the gut of a cow or big that signals when they should stop eating, resulting in larger stock (or something like that). This increases the exposure of bacteria to the antibiotics, making things less safe for all of us.<p>But drug companies and farmers aren&#x27;t to blame for our antibiotic situation. Capitalism encourages profit and doesn&#x27;t ask questions about how it&#x27;s made. Corporations have a fiduciary responsibility. And doctors can&#x27;t be faulted for overprrscribing antibiotics either. A sick person is the ultimate debugging task and most doctors will try anything that could help the patient. I don&#x27;t know if this problem has a good solution.<p>If we research new antibiotics then bacteria will eventually evolve to resist them (kicking the can down the road). If we stop using antibiotics then more people will suffer, potentially unnecessarily (destroying the village to save the village). Trying to fight evolution is a losing game. I am, however, confident that someone somewhere will come up with a break through in the next few decades that will allow us to temporarily solve this problem once again.",1382547261

Antibiotics each time.<p>Would it be better to leave a staph infection untreated with antibiotics? How? Lance and clean the infection site... and then what?<p>Or ear infections? I had frequent undiagnosed ear infections as a small child and now have reduced hearing to thank for it. My entire life I&#x27;ve had people annoyed with me asking them to repeat themselves. Some ear infections may clear up on their own. The ENT has told us this is unlikely in 12mo or younger ages since cranial structures aren&#x27;t in place that allows excess fluid to drain. We can let her have a fever for a day or two, and give Tylenol, but all that&#x27;s going to do is delay the necessary antibiotics. We could also have tubes inserted in her ears, but it&#x27;s not like those are without risks or downsides either.<p>Since people don&#x27;t have to play the lottery with their hearing or their lives anymore because they have access to antibiotics now sure, maybe that has some scary consequences. But it&#x27;s not like people are popping them for a headache or skinned knee. And insulting people may make some feel superior, but it doesn&#x27;t actually solve anything or even hint at a possible solution.

But even at that, the fallacious teleological language he uses about biological evolution by natural selection suggests a way out of this problem. When he says, &quot;Bacteria, like any living organism, want to survive,&quot; and &quot;So anything that we do to try and kill bacteria, or anything the environment does to try and kill bacteria, bacteria will eventually discover ways or find ways around those&quot; he is making factual statements that are plainly incorrect on their face. Bacteria don&#x27;t desire anything, and they don&#x27;t seek out anything or plan anything. Moreover, it is perfectly possible for lineages of bacteria to go completely extinct, and that has undoubtedly happened more times than human beings are aware.<p>Current antiobiotics are themselves mostly derived from &quot;natural&quot; chemicals emitted by microorganisms so that those microorganisms survive natural selection to go on reproducing in a world full of bacteria. Many of the early antiobiotics, for example penicillin, are derived from mycotoxins produced by fungi. Human medicine can use chemicals from fungi for protection against bacteria because human beings and all animals are more closely related to fungi than either fungi or animals are related to bacteria,[1] so fungi have a biochemical similarity to animals that makes it likely (although not certain) that a mycotoxin that is lethal to bacteria will be relatively harmless to human beings.<p>And this is the way forward to developing new antibiotics. As we reach a deeper biochemical understanding of the basis of all life, we will eventually understand the differences, which are biochemical differences at bottom, between human beings and bacteria, between human beings and protists, between human beings and fungi (yes, there are some systematic differences between animals and fungi) and between human beings and all other harmful microorganisms. Only human beings have science labs and clinical research studies to come up with new defenses against the thoughtless, largely immobile threats from other living things. We can form hypotheses, test those hypotheses rigorously, and perhaps make some lineages of harmful microorganisms as extinct in the wild as the smallpox virus and rinderpest virus now are. The intelligence that the hominid lineage has evolved gives human beings advantages that bacteria will never possess.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/DeepGreen/NYTimes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/DeepGreen/NYTimes.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/us/animals-and-fungi-evolutionary-tie.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/us/animals-and-fungi-evolu...</a>",1382546191

When we talk about secure multiparty computation, we do not talk about what might motivate the attacker, we only talk about how to prevent attacks.<p>There are historical counterexamples to the idea that we can analyze a cryptosystem&#x27;s security in terms of the attacker&#x27;s &quot;incentives.&quot;  A famous and well-known example is the German Enigma cipher from WWII.  After the war, German cryptographers were captured and interrogated (the TICOM operation), and one of the things they revealed was that they knew that Enigma <i>could</i> be attacked, but did not believe that it would be <i>worth the effort</i>.  Even the assumption that the attacker will act <i>rationally</i> is bad -- we should be secure against irrational attackers too.<p>&quot;We can&#x27;t know what will happen until it happens&quot;<p>We can, however, design systems that maintain their security properties <i>regardless</i> of what happens (at least under standard cryptographic hardness assumptions, though sometimes we can even get information theoretic security).  ElGamal encryption is secure against <i>any</i> polynomial-time chosen-plaintext attack -- provably so.  The GMR signature system is secure against <i>any</i> polynomial-time adaptive chosen-message attack.  For a very strange construction that illustrates how we can defend against attack strategies we cannot even imagine, consider this work on non-malleable commitments (the construction is on page 13; it is very strange, but the strangeness is key to the security proof, or in other words there are possible attack methods that nobody is aware of that the construction prevents):<p><a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/483.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/483.pdf</a><p>&quot;The field that you want to use to model everything is too narrow for Bitcoin.&quot;<p>Yes, things are very easy when you have no clearly-specified goals, requirements, or constraints.  How can there be any technical criticism of Bitcoin if this sort of response is considered valid?  Anything anyone says is wrong with Bitcoin could always be dismissed as being &quot;too narrow.&quot;",1382545365

Does it apply to mainly specialized fields like Chess, Medicine or any intellectually challenging fields which require specialist knowledge or also to general fields like Politics, Management or Acting (?) which are by definition more general in nature. [Politics or management or acting also require specialist knowledge in a sense requiring in-depth knowledge of international affairs, macro economics, emotive expression control etc.,] The question arises because I have observed many instances of people switching over careers into these general fields late in their careers and shining.

However, the issue is complicated and I wanted to present another side to the original post.<p>I think it&#x27;s likely that those two claims are mostly true in bacteria. Since bacteria evolve quickly and have experienced a lot of evolution, I believe they are likely near-optimum and therefore the second claim (IMHO) follows from that: changes would typically be deleterious.<p>On the other hand, even allowing for that, it&#x27;s possible we could be allowing them to escape a local maximum and reach a more-optimal state.<p>And, there is a more significant criticism you could make:<p>Even if I am right on both points, a population that evolved to be heterogeneous (with some small percentage of wildtype being resistant) could likely have the best of both worlds ;)",1382544196

But consider the worst-case outcome:<p><pre><code>  No more anti-biotics, for anyone.\n</code></pre>\nThat is, we go back to the era before anti-biotics, life in the 1920&#x27;s. Maybe mortality rates will go back to that era, and maybe higher. But thankfully we aren&#x27;t talking about a plague. At least not yet.<p>Recently I had a wisdom tooth extracted. The dentist prescribed anti-biotics, but (unknown to him) I didn&#x27;t take them. I healed fine. And so it was in the 20&#x27;s and before that. Plenty of people survived and thrived before anti-biotics. And life will go on when we don&#x27;t have them anymore.<p>No doubt these super bugs have had to give up certain advantages to attain what is (for their species) a very specialized survival mechanism. Which means that if we ease off of the drugs for a while, the bacterial populations will compete, and the less drug resistant ones will thrive. Then we can use our drugs again. Or that&#x27;s the idea.<p>What I&#x27;d really like to see are the internal assessments of big pharma of these gram neg bugs. Why <i>isn&#x27;t</i> it economically feasible to create new drugs for them? This article makes it sound like there is a large and growing market of suffering people who&#x27;d be more than willing to spend every last cent for a pill to make the pain go away. And if the prospect of people willingly bankrupting themselves for drugs doesn&#x27;t perk big pharma&#x27;s interest, I don&#x27;t know what would.",1382544135

I get that you want a project that&#x27;s constantly getting new bugfixes and features, but there&#x27;s not a whole lot that Sublime doesn&#x27;t do for you as it stands.  It&#x27;s a mature project, most of the kinks have been ironed out. And, whatever functionality doesn&#x27;t exist for it, YOU CAN BUILD.<p>There&#x27;s only one feature that I feel could benfit ST3 right now, and that&#x27;s the ability to move files from the sidebar.<p>But even then, I can&#x27;t hate on the creator because that seems a bit outside the purview of a text editor in the first place (IMO that moves into IDE territory).  I&#x27;d love it, and Sublime pretty much <i>is</i> my IDE already (what with build commands, project files, source control integration plugins, etc), but ultimately I&#x27;m fine with it not being there because I have a perfectly capable file manager open in a window right beside it.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to rag on OP, I absolutely support the mentality that if you feel like something is broken you should fix it: however, in this instance I just feel like it ain&#x27;t broke.",1382544120

But Word is an application, it works with an exact algorithm, so sometimes it doesn't give you the best results.So here's how I do.<p>Disable all those features. I write my article or text completely.<p>Enable all the features again, it'll highlight errors, then I correct the ones that are really errors.<p>Finally, everyone should have techniques to avoid those  minors errors, whether you are developing or writing.",1240034069

But my idea of good backups is a backup service, and in order for a backup service to be sustainable it needs to make money, and in any case I couldn't afford to spend two years writing code for tarsnap without a good chance of earning some money from it later...",1240033698

Extending this approach,  if anyone is looking for free karma, just post separate links to all the classic CS books, without any comments or added explanation (3 separate submissions for the TAOCP Knuth books ;-)). Lots of karma for the taking ;-)<p>now that this is on the front page, here is something interesting. There's a 1000 $ prize for designing a cover for the third edition (see top right hand corner of teh page). The cover of the first two editions are very dense with references to AI history. If I could draw worth a damn I would have taken a shot at it.",1240033639
568105,comment,567807,568032,0,0,bokonist,,,"The generally chaste girls are the same way, they still go for the strong guy over the ""nice"" guy.  Girls that have been taught all their life to go for the nice guy, still find themselves attracted to the bad boy.  The evolutionary/genetic explanation seems to fit my observations the best.<p>I actually think men get some blame for the ""girls falling for a<i></i>holes"" problem.  I think too many quality men listened to their mothers and school teachers, who said the key is to be a nice guy.  The assholes never listened, and learned on the street to win girls via strength.  Thus only the assholes act strong and get the girl, while the nerds lose out.   The solution is that the good men need to grow a backbone.  Then women will be able to find men who they are both attracted to and are good partners.",1240033615

Thankfully, I have never been forced to exclude candidates based on academic pedigree.  And, I test _everyone_ in interviews to see if they're clueful.  So, if I'm already willing to accept candidates without regard to pedigree and I have to act as the gatekeeper myself, there's little disadvantage for an education seeker (I had to choose words carefully here) to ""take"" OpenCourseware classes, perhaps with a group.  Furthermore, I'd respect such initiative much more than someone who attended a mid-tier CS program (like I did).",1240032759

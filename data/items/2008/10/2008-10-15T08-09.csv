Moreover, it'll give lonely male hackers more choice</i><p>Although you probably didn't mean it, this attitude is most definitely Part Of The Problem. It's a pain because you're right - in an ideal, evenly-divided environment, there would be a lot of within-group dating, and everyone would be fine with that.<p>The problem is that, as long as there's a significant imbalance, the constant romantic interest is going to be seriously offputting for the few women in the group.<p>The men don't even need to be malicious or socially maladroit (although, let's face it, as a group hackers tend to lack social skills, which makes things much worse). What would be a perfectly reasonable level of possible romantic interest <i>from each individual person</i> rapidly becomes intolerable if it's all concentrated on the lone female in a big group of males. Which is why you hear so many female geeks screaming ""Stop trying to date me, damn it, and look at my code!""",1224060974

For example, it wouldn't be terribly difficult to poison the databases of aggregators with inconsistent garbage.<p>The data they sell is crap anyway and there will be laws against it if only on the basis of preventing the distribution of false information about people. It's too much work to keep this data clean and that's why they are going to get crushed for spreading lies about people.",1224059947

I often read the view (Slashdot) that if you are in public, or publicly visible, you have no expectation of privacy. This is false in many legislations.<p>I cannot comment on U.S. law, but in Germany (and I presume in many other European countries), you need a person's consent before publishing their picture.<p>Exceptions:<p>a) You are in a public place and you are <i>clearly not the center of the picture</i>.<p>b) You participated in a public event (where it is likely that pictures are taken).<p>c) You are a public figure.<p>Note that even in the case of a public figure you would not be allowed to publish pictures of them engaging in sex.<p>I would be interested in how other countries handle this.",1224058695

It seems much more likely to me that some asshat at gizmodo wants pageviews then that this analysis is right.  Part of Steve's Jobs job (um) is to train execs that are ready to step into his shoes.  That doesn't mean he is leaving.",1224058600

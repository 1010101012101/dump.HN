290785,comment,290759,290759,0,0,gaius,,,"Just the other night, on the train home, I listened to some pompous old geezer ranting about his phone. When he was skiing he collided with someone and a bit of his phone broke off. This was the phone's fault. When he was climbing a ladder to clear leaves out of his gutter, with his phone and his keys in his pocket, the keys scratched the screen of the phone. This was the phone's fault. And on and on and on... It's nothing to do with age. He was just too damn stupid to own one.",1220090051

Any 'angel funding group' that asks for money for an application is to be avoided, they are the tech equivalent of a vanity press, or a literary agent that charges a reading fee.<p>2. In the ideal world, you, the entrepreneur; are doing the investors a favor by letting them share in the reward and the risk of your venture. In the real world you usually need that money to pay for equipment, services and salaries; don't forget to sell your investors on the dream first.",1220088962

One thing you <i>can't</i> do is try to do this passively, i.e. by making one and then stashing it somewhere. You need to keep it online, back it up regularly with the rest of your data (I use a 1T Apple Time Capsule for my first-stage backups) and just keep migrating forwards as you upgrade to larger storage solutions.  This does mean some ongoing work on your part, and it rests on the assumption that someone will have created a truly permanent storage media before you die (or that you train your kids to keep on doing it).<p>There <i>are</i> two easily available media that are known to endure with no active involvement if stored correctly, and will always be accessible no matter what the prevailing technological environment: B&W film and acid-free paper. Everything else is up in the air at the moment.",1220088388

We shouldn't just think about what a framework provides today, but also how it structures the way we evolve our applications, i.e our own abstraction process.",1220087337

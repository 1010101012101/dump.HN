Let me put it a different way:  If I open the Bob object in the inspector and set the &quot;deceased&quot; member to &quot;true&quot;, will Bob claw his way out of his casket?<p>A lot of my confusion about whether it&#x27;s the object or the representation of the object comes from this level.  I tried to learn Smalltalk a few years ago.  We started off with some GUI work and the teacher was quite adamant that we understand that the button on the screen was the object and not just a visual representation of the object.<p>If I&#x27;m understand what you&#x27;ve written properly, then the Smalltalk language isn&#x27;t nearly as important as the Smalltalk environment.  For a comparison point, during my day job, I write a large amount of Python in Emacs.  This code is for an application that runs in a REPL.  Emacs gives the the ability to highlight code and run it.  I can call the &quot;help&quot; function on an object to see its documentation or the &quot;dir&quot; function to view all its members and methods.  I can load code at run time and patch new members onto classes or objects.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s the classic Blub programmer paragraph.  At the very least, Smalltalk sounds like a nice environment and I&#x27;m jealous of having multiple, independent object inspectors.  I&#x27;m also sure that the Smalltalk documentation is better written than what I usually get from &quot;help&quot;.  Still, I suspect that I&#x27;m missing something.  Especially if I&#x27;m still wrong about what it means to work directly on an object.",1380758256

6486216,comment,6480495,6482180,1,0,csandreasen,,,"I agree - securing one&#x27;s privacy is an incredibly important problem.  That said, none of the leaks show any technology that wasn&#x27;t publicly known beforehand (e.g.: packet sniffing, man-in-the-middle attacks, stored personal records obtained from internet/telecommunications companies, etc.).  The fact that these are used on a much larger scale might be surprising to some, but not novel.  We&#x27;ve known for a long time that large, well-funded intelligence organizations operate on a much larger scale than any lone or small group of hackers could.  If you worry about your privacy on the internet, the solutions to these problems were known beforehand (e.g.: encrypt your traffic, authenticate those you communicate with, limit personal data stored in the cloud, etc.).<p>Claiming that the NSA is an active threat to the privacy of Americans without the evidence to back it up is counter-productive.  Schneier himself has written quite a bit about the importance of properly identifying your threats in the process of establishing good security.  I guarantee that spokeo.com and similar sites have more dossiers on Americans that the NSA does, and I&#x27;d be willing to bet that information from those sites have been used more frequently for nefarious purposes against ordinary citizens.  The NSA has the capability to target you - this leads to overblown articles making the leap from &quot;the NSA collects massive amounts of metadata&quot; to &quot;the NSA collects massive amounts of American&#x27;s metadata&quot;, incendiary discussion forums calling for the immediate shutdown of the NSA, imprisonment of top NSA officials, fear mongering about the NSA brought up in situations that have nothing to do surveillance, etc.  What they don&#x27;t have is the motive (seeing as how they&#x27;re an agency charged with the gathering of foreign intelligence) or legal authority to spy on Americans.  The evidence stating that they are actively spying on Americans just isn&#x27;t there.  Until credible evidence shows that NSA is invading the privacy of ordinary people, I&#x27;m going to worry about the credible threats.<p>It creeps me out that I can Google my name and find 6 different websites willing to sell me my current and previous addresses, e-mail address, phone numbers, names of family members, etc. that they harvested from public records; it bothers me that anyone with a Pineapple device can trick my cell phone into connecting to actively hostile network if I forget to turn off the Wifi; it bothers me that I can turn on Collusion in Firefox and see that my browsing activity is reported to 40 different companies across every web page I surf to unless I turn off Javascript and frequently delete all of my cookies; it scares me that I get spam e-mail sent from the compromised accounts of people I know personally that tries to redirect me to malicious web sites; two years ago someone got my debit card number and pulled a little over $2000 out of a bank in Shenzhen - I worry about the security of sites I purchase from over the internet, which ATMs I draw from, what that waiter is doing when he disappears after I hand him my card.  I consider myself a pretty paranoid person.  At this point I don&#x27;t feel threatened by the NSA (if I worked for a foreign government I would probably have a different opinion).<p>I&#x27;m going to continue using every reasonable means to protect the privacy and integrity of data.  I&#x27;m not going to do it because of the NSA - I&#x27;m going to do it because the internet is a security nightmare, and there are lots of people out there who would do lots of things to my data without any regard to my well being.",1380757553
6486215,comment,6485604,6485968,3,0,nhashem,,,"I&#x27;d argue the ACA will enhance the market for SimplyInsured.  Yes, for an individual who wants a basic policy, Covered CA will probably be sufficient and they won&#x27;t need more help than that.  But there are dozens if not hundreds of edge cases.<p>Some examples off the top of my head:<p>- A healthy 24 year old software engineer is making $75,000.  This means he doesn&#x27;t qualify for any of the tax subsidies by buying insurance on the exchange.  He wants to avoid the $2,500 penalty for being uninsured, but every plan on the Covered CA will cost more than that over 12 months.  Perhaps his best option is to buy an individual policy for catastrophic coverage only.<p>- A small business isn&#x27;t sure whether it&#x27;s optimal to insure their employees, or just give them a cash &quot;bonus&quot; and tell them to buy their own policy on Covered CA (similar to what Trader Joe&#x27;s announced they&#x27;re going to do with their part-time employees).<p>- Purchasing insurance on Covered CA is limited only to certain enrollment periods (this is perhaps the biggest misunderstanding, as I&#x27;ve seen various media personalities ask &quot;why wouldn&#x27;t healthy people just wait until their sick, and then get insurance?&quot; countless times).  However, there are exceptions for a life-changing event.  Thus, a person who is laid off (thus counting as one of those life-changing events) would like information on whether their best option is to pay for COBRA or buy a policy on Covered CA.<p>Basically the ACA is complex, but it does turn health insurance into a much more structured and transparent market, which lends itself well to applications like SimplyInsured.  Otherwise, what could any sort of system do for my third scenario, for example?  All anyone could advise to have them stay on COBRA because they&#x27;d probably get screwed by letting it lapse and then trying to get an individual policy.",1380757544

Just like we have numerous alternatives from the kernel and up (whether different patch-sets against mainline Linux, and entirely different open source &quot;Unixy&quot; kernels). Including different C library alternatives; a ton of different shells; a ton of non-X based display servers; a ton of browsers, UI toolkits etc.<p>They are all there because someone wanted something not available to them in the other alternatives and chose to invest their time and/or money to make it happen. How is that not okay? We&#x27;re not forced to use their contributions - numerous solutions have &quot;died&quot; or been confined to obscurity over the years because they never caught on. Entire distributions even.<p>> Do we need three different display servers/ways to show things on screen? No, we do not.<p>We already have <i>far more</i>. Some are mostly dead, like GGI, Y Window System, Berlin/Fresco, NeWS and many more. Some are used in (often <i>very</i>) niche areas, like NanoGUI/MicroWindows (a tiny embedded display server with dual API&#x27;s - one somewhat X compatible and one more Window-ish) and DirectFB. Some low level, such as direct framebuffer access. Some are abstraction layers, like SDL.<p>Many of these overlap in that they can use one or the other as a backend to display on.<p>The point is: Users pick the winners, and the vast majority of development effort for everyone else goes into &quot;just&quot; supporting a small number of the &quot;winners&quot; - the other ones are &quot;on their own&quot;.<p>And this is why Mir vs. Wayland at this point is largely academic: Users will pick a winner. If Mir does not offer advantages but causes disadvantages, Canonical will either lose users or change course. Time will settle this, and there&#x27;s no reason to worry about it.<p>> If we managed to focus our efforts on one project to display things, one project to play audio, and so on, we would not need wrappers that are able to handle 5 different servers, and perhaps we could spend some energy improving a lot of other things that are broken.<p>The flaw with this argument is that it assumes that what one group wants matches what everyone else wants.<p>This is not a company with a single goal, but thousands on thousands of individuals, companies and groups with divergent goal. We consist of people who want Linux to run on tiny embedded devices (I&#x27;ve worked on some), some with no UI, who would be best suited if all the effort on audio and video was invested in shrinking kernel size instead; we consist of people who want Linux running better across giant NUMA clusters of thousands of CPU&#x27;s; we consist of people who want Linux running better on phones and touch devices with tiny screens; we consist of people that want a great desktop; and people who think the idea of a Linux desktop is pointless.<p>Furthermore, we only &quot;see&quot; <i>these</i> battles because they happen within &quot;our&quot; sphere of interest. What about the <i>numerous</i> (and we&#x27;re talking <i>dozens</i>) of other open source OS&#x27;s? Some with userbases in the single digits (e.g. consider our hellbanned &quot;friend&quot; TempleOS with his amazing dedication to his own OS). Nobody reasonably expects them to all put down their work and &quot;focus&quot;. I&#x27;ve submitted patches to AROS for example (an AmigaOS like OS). One might have asked why I did not &quot;focus&quot; on some important Linux system instead. The answer of course is that it was my time to spend, and my goal with spending it on AROS would not be met by spending it on something else.<p>> Besides wanting to control the market or something, why does Canonical need Mir? Why do we need it?<p>A number of people do believe their technical differences are sufficient to merit the difference. But control might very well be it, and it is often a good one, and it&#x27;s worth reminding everyone that &quot;political reasons&quot; are <i>often</i> behind major splits in the open source community, but the results are often very different from expected.<p>E.g. GNOME started largely because of issues with Qt <i>licensing</i>, but the licensing issues are now moot, but the projects have taken wildly divergent paths in some areas (and agreed on common standards in many others). While the original reason was annoying, in the end, I for one is still happy we have GNOME as a result as I still don&#x27;t like the feel of KDE (purely subjective; I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine for those who use it).<p>What is GCC today was once EGCS - a fork that split off from mainline GCC because the GCC maintainers were too slow to accept patches. Eventually the fork was resolved when EGCS in effect became the official, blessed version.<p>Clang is another example of something that at least got major backing (from Apple) largely on the basis of licensing: They don&#x27;t want to upgrade to a GCC version covered by GPLv3. While many object to their rather obvious reason (given their choice not to upgrade software that have relicensed), we&#x27;re better off for having the competition.<p>Even the X.org X server is the result of &quot;politics&quot; with the XFree86 team. At the time one could have easily argued that it was unnecessary, but it gave us a new wave of innovation within X, many changes which are part of the inspiration for Wayland (and thus Mir too).<p>> Choice is good, but I believe that if we keep making a new &quot;Y&quot; every time we disagree with someone we will just end up a even more fragmented community than we are now, moving in no direction.<p>Keep in mind that &quot;moving in no direction&quot; is far better for many of us than moving in the wrong direction. If you don&#x27;t agree with the decisions behind Wayland, countering it by supporting Mir may be preferable to letting Wayland win by default.<p>> I guess until the community manages to communicate, linux will remain mostly used on servers and by interested parties that want to configure everything.<p>That&#x27;d be perfectly fine, but keep in mind that Linux grew as big as it did on the server side exactly <i>because</i> everyone are able to do their own thing, and the stuff that &quot;sticks&quot; or that everyone can agree on tends to eventually become part of mainline. As a result of that openness, Linux <i>can</i> run in some form or other (sometimes with extensive patches, sure) on everything from a non-MMU x86 (in the form of ELKS) via smartphones and tiny embedded platforms, to massive single-image supercomputers or multi-image supercomputers/clusters.<p>And on the &quot;desktop&quot;, Linux is finally making inroads underpinning Android, ChromeOS, and yes, &quot;desktop&quot; distributions like Ubuntu that are seeing the occasional massive organisational roll out as well as slowly making inroads in the &quot;normal&quot; desktop market.<p>I&#x27;m not too concerned about desktop Linux becoming mainstream. We&#x27;re already at a stage where for many users distributions like Ubuntu are far less painful than e.g. Windows (my printers, for example, are supported by Ubuntu out of the box, but require a driver download of tens of MB full of crap we don&#x27;t want for Windows), and where many users have multiple computers running Linux without even realising. E.g. I have Linux on my fileserver (and most turnkey NAS boxes today tend to run Linux), my wifi router, my phones (Android), tablet (Android), my TV streaming boxes (an old WDTV Live running a MIPS version of Linux as well as an Android &quot;TV stick&quot;) and more.<p>Linux in some form or another is likely already on more consumer devices than Windows will ever be on. That it hasn&#x27;t taken over the desktop market (so far, anyway) matters less and less, as it&#x27;s making sufficient inroads to address what used to be the major pain point: Lack of driver support from reluctant or outright hostile hardware manufacturers. <i>That</i> is what matters to me. Of course others will have other concerns. And some of them will donate their time, and/or money, to projects that in some cases will take Linux in totally different directions than what I&#x27;d like to see. That&#x27;s cool too.",1380756805

Over simplifying the design of software and &quot;feature list&quot; thinking are perfect examples of technical immaturity and naivete. Even a very simple system with a small number of moving parts requires a lot of skilled and subtle work in order to ensure it works reliably, at the appropriate level of performance, and in a way that is usable. In a way good programmers make it more difficult for younger programmers to notice these things, since an elegant design might reflect innumerable man-hours of careful decision making and improvement but it works so well and so smoothly and with so few parts that it can seem almost trivial.<p>When someone sees a line of code such as the classic &quot;fast inverse square root&quot; it&#x27;s obvious that it&#x27;s necessary to take a step back, to realize that you&#x27;re not going to understand the depths of what&#x27;s going on intuitively, that there is likely a lot of deep optimization and balancing going on with that code. But when we see code that doesn&#x27;t have a big clanking WTF in the middle of it, when we see code that seems to make intuitive sense, we don&#x27;t tend to ponder the optimization and tradeoffs that went into it. But in truth those can be just as deep and just as profound for ordinary looking code as for obviously clever stuff. That goes double when you only use the software.<p>Consider a thought experiment: replicating google. The naive answer is that it&#x27;s easy, all you need is a big DB, a web crawler to load up the DB, and a search frontend. And that might work, but it would be terrible. It would be horrendously expensive and produce profoundly disappointing results with even more profoundly disappointing performance. From an end-user perspective google is simple, but the complexities and the elegances underneath are the important bits, and those are much more challenging to replicate.",1380756403

The &quot;means of production&quot; in the analogy you&#x27;re drawing is the compiler, and the source code is the instructions on how to operate the compiler. The big social problem that people are trying to tackle isn&#x27;t access to compilers, it&#x27;s access to those instructions. We&#x27;ve gotten to the point where most programs are written in common languages, and most common languages have free (as in freedom) compilers, interpreters, runtimes, etc.<p>It&#x27;s true that some people have definitely tried to write programs in their own languages with their own secret compilers just to make things even more difficult for potential copyright infringers, but thankfully that practice is not common because it has way more drawbacks than it does advantages.",1380755529

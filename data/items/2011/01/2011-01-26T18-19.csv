As a tenant you <i>want</i> to live in a particular place, whether its for location, or amenities, or price etc.<p>When you lease an apartment, the landlord's record of customer service is almost never a factor in signing the lease. It just never comes up. And the cost of moving is so high that its unlikely someone will leave a unit because the landlord sucked (I know this from experience). So the landlord doesn't have to compete with other landlords based on customer service, they compete based on the price, location and amenities of the units they offer.<p>So there's really no incentive for most landlords to be better landlords. The only ones who try, are mostly just doing it to follow the law or out of a sense of fairness.<p>The market just doesn't really reward landlords enough for their customer service ability...",1296068310

If I were a politician, I would oppose laws (actually like Dawkins does here) that ban discrimination based on sexual orientation (as well as religion.)<p>Would my thinking be suspect?  Does that mean that I think that gay people shouldn't be hired or be able to get housing?<p>From the common / popular ""pro-gay"" view my positions would be characterized as ""anti-gay"" and I would risk being demonized by GLAAD, etc.<p>The problem here is that these terms ""pro-gay"" and ""anti-gay"" etc, are completely political and ignore all possibility of nuance.<p>Let me put it another way. I think a gay person should be allowed to choose not to rent out a room in their house to a mormon who, when he came to see the room, went on and on about how evil gay people are.<p>Clearly, this gay person is choosing to discriminate based on religion.   Clearly, also, being forced to rent a room to someone you are not going to get along with is a recipe for trouble.<p>But, specifically, it is a violation of your property rights in the room you're renting out, just as forcing you to rent it out, or preventing you from renting it to anybody, or dictating the price at which you can rent it is a violation of your right to use this property as you see  fit.<p>Further, freedom of association is the freedom to associate with whom you like and also not associate with people you don't get along with.<p>Discriminating against people (based on sexuality or beliefs) is a bad idea when you're hiring because you'll exclude people who would be productive in preference to people who might be less productive.<p>But discrimination is intrinsic in both property rights and freedom of association. (And freedom of association is simply another way of saying property rights in your own body.)<p>So, while GLAAD and other political groups would call me an anti-gay politician in this hypothetical, would you really call me a fraud?<p>I think in the end I'm agreeing with you that it is not black and white, you just hit on the political angle that I can speak directly to.<p>I've been called ""anti-gay"" because I don't support ""pro-gay"" legislation, even though my position is based in a (stronger than my opponents, I believe) belief in human rights.",1296068066

2144434,comment,2143977,2144352,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"I see the customer service issues in the real estate industry (especially property management) as being created by two issues (and disclosure: I've worked in real estate for the past 11 years, from the front desk to franchise ops manager to consulting back to the industry):<p>* High staff turnover
* Procedures that suck staff time, instead of supporting them<p>Being a property manager is, for the most part, an awful job. If you sell real estate, you deal with the owner giving you grief; when you manage a property you have the owner, the tenant, and the suppliers all wanting a piece of your time, and rarely to say thank you. Because you don't need to be a rocket surgeon to work in PM, the pay is low, and most staff are young people looking for something better. When they leave, they take with them most of the corporate memory about the tenant and the property. If you hate your property manager, chances are it's because several times in the past year you've called and been put through to a different person every time.<p>Lack of procedures is linked to lack of investment in this part of the business (also reflected in low salaries and high staff turnover). Most real estate offices are run by salespeople, current or former. They see one sales commission worth $000s as being infinitely better than one tenancy worth $16 / week. So they don't invest in systems, processes, staff development, or great software. This is the market hole you speak of - but while there's a gap in the market, there may not be a market in the gap...<p>...EXCEPT that, ironically, a rent roll is traditionally the only asset a real estate business has to sell - without it, you just have a sales team who could go next door and open up tomorrow. PM departments also provide a regular income when sales decrease, which has been the case over the past two years in most of the world affected by the recession / GFC. I don't have enough evidence to support a claim that owners are more willing to invest in their team, particularly property management, as a result of this; but I hope it's the case.",1296067510

That might as well.<p>I'll agree that some form of pounding of the pavement and sales are going to be required.  Just be picky in that regard -- there is a massive range in the quality of sales people, and the ones that genuinely care about the customer (instead of themselves) are also in the minority.",1296067063

    multiple instances of main() otherwise.
</code></pre>

      public static void main(String[] args) { }
      public static void main() { }
      // why is it the one with the args gets called?
    }
</code></pre>
Also, that comment leads to the prediction that ""If I put static in front of something, I can only have one of it!"" (or the converse ""If I leave static off, I can have multiples of it"") which is false. Avoiding method overloading and making two methods of the same signature, Java will give you a ""func() is already defined in t"" error regardless of having static or not.<p>>If you leave this out, you'll get an error<p><pre><code>    public class t {
      public void main(String[] args) { }
      // and for good measure
      public static void main() { }
    }
</code></pre>
This compiles just fine, however at runtime you'll get the error ""Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main"" Very nice for a beginner: ""I have a main! It's right there! I have two in fact! ..Oh, it wants the args version.""<p>>I teach static from a general standpoint of stating belonging to the class rather than an object of that class. For didactic purposes, sometimes you phrase what-ifs in odd ways to get the point across.<p>That's a lot better, but now I'm curious, do you go over creating Objects and the keyword ""new"" in the first day as well? How do you describe the difference between object methods and static class methods without an object to demonstrate? If you try to make an object method in your hello world program:<p><pre><code>    public class t {
      public static void main(String[] args) { hello(); }
      public void hello() { System.out.println(""Hi""); }
    }
</code></pre>
you get a helpful ""non-static method hello() cannot be referenced from a static context"". Of course you can always do ""new t().hello();"" but...<p>""static"" is a complicated keyword, I'm not convinced that saying ""You have to have it, treat it like magic for now but we'll cover what it really means later"" isn't a fine enough cop-out for HelloWorld.<p>Perhaps the correct approach with HTML then is to teach XML that happens to render in a browser first, then go on into what makes HTML special. I'm also not convinced that HTML by itself gets very complicated. Sure, bringing in CSS and JavaScript and then dealing with all the issues of different browsers can get as complicated as a Java HelloWorld program, but that's not exactly HelloWorld material for HTML.<p>I'll agree that young students can handle a lot more complexity than we give them credit for.",1296066986

Actually, I've not worked with an office that hasn't had some sort of technology for contact and property data; managing work orders, automating payments, assigning tasks to other managers are all fairly common now as well (and I see other key selling points in the product, so that's not to be taken as a criticism for 2 years' work).",1296066914

He is a fake, a fraud, a charlatan, drawing a salary for a job that could have gone to an honest astronomer. Moreover, I would regard his equanimity in holding two diametrically opposing views simultaneously in his head as a revealing indicator that there is something wrong with his head.</i><p>Dawkins seems to believe that to be hired as a scientist, one must believe in the truth of the model one uses. I can't quite understand why he holds this view - at least in my experience, scientists study hypothesis they don't believe in all the time. I've done this (I don't believe in Copenhagen QM at all, and I'm skeptical of Bohmian mechanics). Does this make me a fraud? According to Dawkins, I guess it does.<p>By his logic, Einstein (not to mention Podolsky and Rosen) was also a fraud. He used a theory he didn't believe was correct (quantum mechanics) to derive conclusions he didn't believe were true. (Sadly, he didn't live long enough to see experimental verification of what he believed was a reducto ad absurdum.)<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox</a><p>I wonder if Dawkins truly believes all scientists who use theories they don't believe are frauds, or if he only thinks this about theistic (quasi-)theories [1]? If he holds the former belief, I think he really needs to devote a little bit of time to learning about metaphysics and the philosophy of science.<p>[1] Many beliefs held by theists are ""not even wrong"", and are therefore not theories. Take, for example, the following flavor of young earth creationism: ""<i>God created the universe 6000 years ago, with the state psi(0) = U(-6000 years) psi(world today). psi is the wavefuntion, U is the propagator. It is true that U(-20 billion years ) psi(world today) yields the big bang, but that's just a mathematical curiosity rather than history.</i>"" This belief is unfalsifiable, and completely consistent with all scientific theories that are governed by an initial value problem (pretty much all of them).",1296066901

I recently came back to Java after a multi-year hiatus, and suddenly found myself back in a world where people tend to program in patterns such as the above.  The funny part is, my experience has ultimately been positive.<p>I was recently in the position of having to patch and modify a very large Java library (written by some well respected Google guys) because I needed it to do something different from its original intent.  The OP would have hated this library--when I cracked it open I found innumerable factories, strategies, observers, visitors, etc. etc.  After studying the library for a while (which was frustrating because as a developer I wanted to just dive in and write some code), I started to realize that the patterns were well-utilized and built with anticipation of expansion.  In the end, I was able to inject my code into the midst of the patterns at some key strategic points and make fundamental changes to the library.  Most importantly, I did so feeling like I had the implicit blessing of the developers, and that the general algorithmic flow of the library was not impacted.<p>What I've found after my return to Java is that the language is so boringly, stultifyingly structured that an amazing thing happens--you can actually weave together an application with thirty dependencies on other libraries and have it work.  Libraries aren't walking over eachother and behave in predictable fashions.  Developers aren't dynamically injecting code into core libraries because they can't.<p>Now, the library I was patching was the kind of library that deals with real world server-side complexity (managing data across multiple stores, with support for testing environments, etc.).  That's where these types of patterns shine.  They don't shine in examples like the OP's.  If a developer in my organization always wrote code like that, I would hope they would be let go.  But if they wrote code like that where it was needed and useful, I would be quite happy with them!  Conversely, if a developer thought such patterns were never necessary and were never useful, I would think they needed to learn their craft a bit more.<p>In the end, it's all about pragmatism and experience.  Over the years I've been bitten for over abstracting and under abstracting.  Over the years you develop a weather sense for how extensible a particular piece of code needs to be.",1296066490

2144309,comment,2144221,2144221,0,0,geebee,,,"Though I'm an atheist,  I'd disagree that a good scientist should be agnostic.  The reason is segmentation, along with a widespread belief that religious beliefs are beyond measurement in the physical world.<p>That said, I disagree with your assertion that the burden is on science to prove the non-existence of the god(s).  In fact, there's a distinction often drawn between ""strict"" and ""soft"" (or empirical) atheism.  A lot of people confuse empirical atheism with agnosticism, since it does not contain a positive belief in the absence of a god, but israther a default position against the existence of got in the absence of compelling evidence.  This second type seems to be what the OP is getting at.  For instance, when medical researchers say ""there is no evidence that silicon implants cause autoimmune disease"", this often sounds to the public like equivocating.  However, scientists will say things like this after tracking 8,000 women, half of whom have had implants, and discovering that they develop autoimmune disease at rates that are, statistically speaking, indistinguishable.  ""We found no evidence...""<p>Prior to a study, I suppose a scientist might say ""I don't know"" if there is absolutely no literature on the subject and a very compelling hypothesis has been advanced.  They might even say ""I'm inclined to think this is true, research is underway.""  But obviously, scientists don't accept the hypothesis by default until someone disproves it, even when the hypothesis is very compelling.<p>Religion can be different, I recognize this, in that to some people, the hypothesis (god exists) is extremely compelling  (they feel this is true deep in their core, they've had a revelatory or mystical experience, or they believe that the universe simply couldn't exist without) and impossible to measure.  So maybe they see this as a 50-50 proposition, with an equal burden of proof on both sides?",1296066340

Not that I recommend this approach over protocols.<p>- The awesomeness of @selector, especially if you're coming from Java and used to writing anonymous classes everywhere simply for the sake of making functions first-class entities.<p>- The lack of public/protected/private visibility modifiers and how variables are suddenly part of the public API when you define them in properties. Say you have a variable you want to keep private, but you need to frequently update its value. You go ahead and define @property (nonatomic, retain) for it so within the class so that you can simply do self.varName = newVarValue to update it. But now all your clients/outside clients will see; you need to write the release-and-retain setter yourself in the .m file to prevent this.<p>- The minimalism of Xcode.

  reproduction is technically irrelevant to his competence
  as an eye surgeon, it tells you something about him. It
  is revealing. It is relevant in a general way to whether
  we would wish him to treat us or teach us. A patient
  could reasonably shrink from entrusting her eyes to a
  doctor whose beliefs (admittedly in the apparently
  unrelated field of obstetrics) are so cataclysmically
  disconnected from reality.
</code></pre>
This statement seems to work when applied to something like ""babies come from storks"", but it generalizes poorly. There are simply too many incorrect beliefs floating around; it's difficult to find someone who has resisted all of them. Would you refuse treatment from an ophthalmologist who believed:<p>1. The seasons are caused by Earth approaching and receding from the Sun?<p>2. Fixed-wing aircraft fly because air moves over and under the wing at the same rate?<p>3. Thomas Edison invented the light bulb?<p>All of these are just as wrong as stork-babies or creationism, and all are just as relevant (ie, not at all) to ophthalmology. I don't demand that my doctor rigorously examine every belief they hold, merely the ones related to surgery. Frankly, a creationist surgeon is much less worrying than a surgeon who believes wi-fi causes cancer.<p><pre><code>  My colleague takes the view that this YEC is entitled to a job
  as a professor of astronomy, because he keeps his private
  beliefs to himself while at work. I take the opposite view. I
  would object to employing him, on the grounds that his
  research papers, and his lectures to students, are filled with
  what he personally believes to be falsehoods. He is a fake, a
  fraud, a charlatan, drawing a salary for a job that could have
  gone to an honest astronomer. Moreover, I would regard his
  equanimity in holding two diametrically opposing views
  simultaneously in his head as a revealing indicator that there
  is something wrong with his head. 
</code></pre>
There's an idiom that goes something like ""reality is what keeps happening even if you don't believe in it"". If a creationist is able to perform correct science, I see no reason to dismiss it out of hand. Especially considering the wide variety of creationist beliefs now extant in the US -- even if he believes Earth was created six thousand years ago, he may be willing to concede that the Universe is roughly fourteen billion years old.",1296065619

I guess this is cool, but we never really have a need for this.

My suggestion to the founders would be to work to leverage that sentiment to get RentPost in front of landlords.  A couple ideas:<p>* Allow roommates to collectively pay their rent online without the landlord being a customer of RentPost. You then turn around and cut a cheque which is mailed to the landlord.  Included with the cheque is the upsell to subscribe to the service.<p>* Allow tenants to submit maintenance requests, etc, turn these into an email to the landlord.  The property manager could simply reply to the email, but you could also give them the option to manage the ""ticket"" online & you could ease them into your service.<p>On a different note, hit up the Property Management trade shows!",1296065236

The challenge is, that prices people with less money out of the market - so price discrimination is about finding ways to justify cutting prices for some people while charging more to people who can afford more.<p>Examples: Student discounts, senior citizen discounts, kid's meals, and matinee prices at movie theaters are all price discrimation. A/B testing prices is... just A/B testing prices.<p>Though, the wise A/B price-tester does so by offering two different sales - one discounted product, and one more discounted product. This seems to minimize backlash - finding someone else got a better discount doesn't bother people as much as finding out they paid a higher price.",1296065135

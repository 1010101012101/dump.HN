We see the products out there, and we get a funny feeling, we feel we can do a LOT better. But we are International Grad Students, on student visas. We cannot drop out, even if we want to.( Visa becomes invalid, Currently there are no start up visas :)) Oh, if only Paul Graham were president!. I felt so jealous when octopart posted about his/her dropping out of grad school. We have come to the point, where we are trying to moonlight it. But as moon-lighters know, sometimes it is very hard. Are there more people like us? Leave a comment as to how you deal with it (tips!) Or just leave us a comment!                 \n                                                                                ",1173592591

Which is lots of fun because you can tell they don't quite get the ""whole thing"" as you have in your mind no matter how well you explain to them.<p>Co-incidentally I wrote a post titled ""Mere ideas have never been this useless"" just earlier today.

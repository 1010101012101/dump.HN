6091274,comment,6090549,6091203,23,0,pron,,,"I share the sentiment. People often mention that Go is less verbose than Java like they were talking about Clojure or something. Go is just a little less verbose than Java (other than in a hello world example), and targets the same conceptual &quot;level&quot; (same order of abstractions, same &quot;distance&quot; from the metal, although Java can get closer to metal than Go). So, sure, it feels a little more modern in some respects (and less modern in others), but when considering both languages carefully, I find I really need a magnifying to tell the two apart. If Go had offered everything that Java does, I still wouldn&#x27;t have had a compelling reason to switch because the differences are just too small.<p>But Go doesn&#x27;t offer everything Java does. Like you said, Java&#x27;s ecosystem dwarfs Go&#x27;s. Java has dynamic linking, runtime code instrumentation, unparalleled tooling, and better performance than Go. The only advantage I see Go has over Java is a shorter startup time, which makes it a reasonable choice for writing command-line programs. As for concurrency constructs, Java is far more flexible than Go, and because goroutines and channels <i>are</i> easy, I&#x27;ve ported them to Java[1] (and Clojure).<p>Go sure is easy to get started with, but it would have to be 20 times better than it is to make me give up the JVM. In reality, it&#x27;s just a recent, beginner-friendly Java without the awesomeness of the JVM.<p>(P.S. I&#x27;m not sure Java&#x27;s often mocked factory-factories aren&#x27;t simply a result of the huge number of multi-million LOC programs that have been written in Java. It&#x27;s just experience, and Go sure doesn&#x27;t have the necessary abstractions to make engineering large systems any easier.

6091272,comment,6089294,6090428,5,0,rayiner,,,"> First, the Constitution itself doesn&#x27;t say that only U.S. citizens in U.S. territory enjoy its protections.<p>If the Constitution said: &quot;people in France owe us taxes&quot; would that be valid and binding? Of course not. American law cannot impose obligations on the French, and reciprocally, American law cannot give rights to the French. The Constitution is law, and American law extends to American soil and American citizens abroad. That&#x27;s the nature of law.<p>> And the Declaration of Independence (which is not legally binding the way the Constitution is, but should give an idea of the mindset of the time) states all men are created equal.<p>To get a full idea of the &quot;mindset of the time&quot; the Declaration of Independence used flowery language like &quot;all men are created equal&quot; but the Constitution enshrined slavery into law for another generation and set up a system of government where only white, landowning males could vote.

Now, they also sell at both the SMB and the Enterprise level, so his numbers maybe right on average.<p>Now that being said, I do think Marketo&#x27;s business model seems to be upside down - and I&#x27;m a Marketo customer.

6091154,comment,6090307,6090307,18,0,carstimon,,,"Let me try to explain Schanuel&#x27;s conjecture a little bit, if you&#x27;re lost on words like transcendence degree.  This turned out longer than I hoped so I hope it&#x27;s not just a wall of text.<p>sqrt(2), , /2, ^2, and e are all irrational.  Now think about  and /2: these are very closely related.  What I mean is:<p> - 2(/2) = 0<p>So we can add some combination of the two numbers, and get 0.<p>Now what about  and e?  These feel different.  After working with them one gets the feeling that \na<i> + b</i>e\nwill never be zero, if a and b are rational[1].  If that&#x27;s true, then  and e are called &quot;linearly independent over the rationals&quot;.  We do not know whether  and e are linearly independent over the rationals.  (In particular, we don&#x27;t know whether e+pi is rational.) It turns out that stuff like that is hard.<p>Now, there&#x27;s an even stronger thing than being &quot;linearly independent&quot;, and that&#x27;s being &quot;algebraicly independent&quot;.  When talking about linear indepence we only thought about multiplying by rationals and adding (linear relations).  For example,  and /2 are NOT algebraicly independent.  What about  and ^2?  Well:\n()^2 - (^2) = 0\nwhich is rational.  This shows that  and ^2 are also not algebraicly independent. (The equation is obvious, but think about what it means:  on the left of the minus, I have , and I&#x27;m raising it to a power of 2.  on the right of the minus, I have ^2, and I&#x27;m raising it to a power of 1).\nWe do not know whether  and e are mutually transcendental.<p>So you should think: linear independence of rationals is a weak way of saying &quot;these numbers aren&#x27;t that related.&quot;  Algebraic independence means there even less related.  You can think of both as ways of proving huge amounts of numbers are irrational.  If we can prove that e and pi are algebraicly independent then for example we would know\ne + 5e^3 + e^7 + pi + 4pi^4\nis irrational.<p>Now, you can understand what this conjecture says.  Take z_1, z_2, ..., z_n which are complex numbers.  If you want, you can just imagine them to be irrational numbers.  Suppose they are linearly independent over the rationals.  The conjecture is that: at least n of z_1, z_2, ..., z_n, e^(z_1), e^(z_2), ..., e^(z_n) are algebraicly independent.<p>[1] And not both 0 ;)<p>Related: If you know some linear algebra, think about this.  sqrt(2) is irrational.  Think of 1 and sqrt(2) has &quot;vectors&quot; which you can multiply by scalars, but the only scalars you&#x27;re allowed to multiply by are rational numbers.  In this way you get a &quot;vector space over the rationals&quot; which includes things like 3+sqrt(2), 5, and 7sqrt(2).  This vector space is also a field: we can multiply things together, and we get another element of the vector space:\n(3+sqrt(2))(7sqrt(2)) = 3x7sqrt(2) + 7x2 = 14 + 21sqrt(2).<p>Because sqrt(2) is algebraic over the rationals, this vector space-field thing is finite.  But now do it with pi instead of sqrt(2), and you&#x27;ll get an infinite dimensional vector space with the vectors 1, pi, pi^2, pi^3....  Elements of this field are things like 4+pi+7pi^3.",1374597670

Also, cubicle farm style office buildings are typically in cooling mode, i.e. they are rejecting excess heat for at least 3/4 of the year even in a temperate climate because of the heat generated by people, IT, lighting etc. Therefore reducing solar gain through windows is pretty critical to improving energy efficiency by reducing the load on the cooling systems. So using solar panels as part of a brise soleil to provide shading to windows would be the optimum solution but this is a more expensive facade structure to build and more expensive and less safe to maintain, so it&#x27;s typically only done on high spec buildings which need some eco bling.<p>Residential buildings have different factors in play. Residential efficiency is all about retaining as much heat as possible in winter through air tightness, winter solar gain through windows and insulation. With good insulation and solar shading, summer heat gains are not so much of an issue for residential in temperate climates; for example most people in Northern Europe don&#x27;t have AC because there are only a few weeks of the year when you would have it switched on.",1374597089

In both spaces we get periodic design documents and slide ware that look really cool and get everyone all excited. But in both spaces these designs rarely get implemented, much less reach production.<p>The reason is that the domain details are so extensive and difficult that almost nobody can get past them. I like to describe both these problem domains as &quot;fractal,&quot; because when you&#x27;re 100,000 feet up it looks pretty simple, but the closer you get the more details there are. If I had a dollar for every hacker who told me how easy it would be to make a travel search web site or an email client, I&#x27;d be rich.<p>In both spaces, a very small number of players create the core technologies, and a much larger set of players layer on top of these cores. In travel, for example, you have the GDS companies (Sabre, Amadeus, etc.), ITA, and Expedia. Everybody else -- literally, <i>everybody</i> else -- layers on top of one these systems. Kayak? ITA customer. Hipmunk? ITA customer. Etc. This means the vast majority of players don&#x27;t actually have to deal with the fractal domain complexity. And almost nobody has any clue there&#x27;s any difference between say, an ITA and a Hipmunk, even though one has a million lines of code and runs thousands of machines and the other has a fairly standard website. (#)<p>Similarly, in email, a handful of players create real mail stacks. These are the usual suspects (Microsoft, Google, Apple, IBM) and a handful of others (Inky, Sparrow, Thunderbird) Everybody else -- literally <i>everybody</i> else -- layers on top of GMail or Outlook. Mailbox.app? Layer on top of GMail. Xobni? Layer on top of Outlook. Postbox? Fork of Thunderbird.<p>In the mail space, there are at least some decent open source libraries to use. In the travel search space there is literally <i>nothing</i> to start from but a blank sheet of paper. Carl de Marcken did most of the early work figuring it out for ITA, and it nearly killed him.<p>I actually seek out domains like this; either because they&#x27;re defensible, or because I&#x27;m insane. I&#x27;m not sure which yet.<p>(#) If you&#x27;re thinking it&#x27;s necessary or even better to own the million lines of code and run thousands of machines, think again: Kayak created substantially more value for its shareholders than ITA did, with a lot less effort.",1374597055

Which usually involved buttering up one of their employees and fobbing the work off on them. Some of them had only a couple of reports. I know of at least one who had none.<p>Then came the &quot;solution.&quot; A program whereby managers had to spend 90 minutes a week on the floor talking to their employees.

This got inserted into everybody&#x27;s objectives.<p>I found this particularly galling because I&#x27;d locked horns with a couple of the worst offenders in some of the few meetings I&#x27;d managed to dodge, and because, managing a team of 15 devs, I already made 1-on-1 time available to them weekly and easily spent 90 mins a day with them doing actual work. (You just can&#x27;t manage technical folk without some involvement and understanding of their daily challenges. There&#x27;s a respect issue otherwise, on both sides.)<p>The program came and went. Nobody failed the objective, though after the first week the usual suspects just hid in their office or spent their 90 minutes playing with their phones.

While Mother Jones decries the subpoenas as &quot;unprecedented&quot; the reality seems to be that courts have not acted uniformly in this area:<p>&quot;But he notes that while anonymous speech made by Americans is protected under the Constitution, &#x27;courts have been inconsistent in applying that protection against civil subpoenas aimed at identifying anonymous internet users.&#x27; In the case Dendrite International, Inc. v. Doe No. 3, for example, an appellate court held that a company was not allowed to unmask users who had criticized the company on a Yahoo message board.&quot;<p>What the article makes out to be an &quot;unprecedented overreach&quot; is actually a fairly subtle balancing of several different concerns. The first, and overriding, concern is that a litigant has the right to any evidence that might prove his case. Balanced against that is the concern that discovery could &quot;chill&quot; protected anonymous speech. Implicated in that second point is two issues: 1) most of the subjects of the subpoena do not seem to be Americans who can raise the 1st Amendment issue in the first place; and 2) 1st amendment concerns are weakened by the fact that any &quot;chilling effect&quot; would be the result of actions by a non-state actor (Chevron) who isn&#x27;t bound by the 1st amendment.<p>The fact that we hate Chevron shouldn&#x27;t blind us to the facts of the case. Chevron is fighting a $19 billion judgment against them. They have a colorable claim that they are the victims of an extortion scheme. It is the judge&#x27;s job to figure out how to get them the evidence they need to prove their claim while not trampling on any Americans&#x27; rights in the process.

To add to what you were saying and expand a little bit:<p>A principal ideal domain is a ring in which every ideal is generated by only one element, so whenever we see (a, b), we know there is some element c such that (a, b) = (c). I think this is what vog meant by having a &quot;real&quot; GCD - only in a principal ideal domain is your gcd <i>unique</i>. Without uniqueness, we can still define a greatest common divisor such that if gcd(a, b) = g, we know that there is nothing we can multiply by g to get a divisor of both a and b; that is, there&#x27;s no extra factor we can add to g in order to get another factor of both a and b. That is enough to call g a GCD - but it&#x27;s not necessarily unique! It turns out that in rings which <i>aren&#x27;t</i> principal ideal domains, you can have more than one GCD! It&#x27;s bizarre to think exactly what &quot;greatest&quot; means in this context, but you can also just think of it as &quot;can&#x27;t add any more factor while still dividing both a and b&quot;.<p>Ring theory is fun!

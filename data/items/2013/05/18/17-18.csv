5729722,comment,5728296,5728675,6,0,gnosis,,,"As a sysadmin, you have to be capable of quickly editing files no matter what or whose machine you're on.<p>This means that you often don't have the luxury of installing anything on the machine you find yourself on.  You might find yourself on a small Linux-based router that only has busybox on it.  This is the case for many resource-starved VPS' and other small Linux installs as well.  Busybox comes with vi, but not with emacs (or even vim).  If a sysadmin finds himself on one of these, he simply has to make do with what he has.  He may not have the time, or an internet connection, or the authority to install anything at all.  So familiarity with vi in these circumstances is essential.<p>On very few machines will the situation be reversed: with emacs or mg available and vi not (I have never run in to such a case).  So a sysadmin has little incentive to learn or install emacs.<p>As for mg, even if you could install it, I'm really not sure what it would buy you over vanilla vi.  In the kinds of resource-starved environments where you'd actually prefer mg over emacs, you wouldn't want to spend a lot of time editing anything.  A quick in and out edit should really be all you could reasonably be expected to do in such a situation... and that could probably be done equally well with either mg or vi.",1368899879

JavaScript, too. Both are used because there are no alternatives. There are obviously alternatives for PHP but these seem to fall so far behind in ease of use that they don't gain enough traction. Therefore I argue we need a new language - easy to use as PHP but without all the flaws of it.<p><i>From my point of view, ruby, python all the rest are inherently broken because nobody makes any damned products from them which aren't used by other programmers or sold as a service.</i><p>I am no web developer and my knowledge of commonly used web frameworks and who uses what is really limited but it seems reasonable to assume this statement is wrong.<p>I did a quick search and the first hit was Django build on top of Python used by Instagram and Pinterest.

If these languages are so good, why is no one making any software with them that ordinary people and not programmers can actually use?</i><p>Again, my personal guess is that the ease of (ab)use of PHP outweighs - or at least seems to do so - the advantages of »better« languages.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fiveq.com/blog/programming/building-django-good-company/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fiveq.com/blog/programming/building-django-good-c...</a>",1368899084

Some do, but when you provide specific facts it's much easier to argue against them.  So I think it's more convenient to stick with ""PHP sucks.""<p>My theory is that people ranting about PHP are mainly in three categories - the first being developers who have never used PHP.  The second are people who used PHP back in 1998 and haven't never really checked out any any modern PHP frameworks.  The rest are developers who inherit a horrible codebase written in PHP.  So they're gripes are a combination of their own horribly-written codebase they're stuck maintaining along with PHP-specific complaints.<p>PHP definitely has its quirks but there is interesting work happening with the language and many frameworks.  I do quite a bit of PHP coding at the moment but previously in my career I've been full time Java developer, C# developer and even now I write quite a lot of Objective C.  I have hated things about every one of those platforms.  Every one of them offers the opportunity to write horrible code.

5729596,comment,5729199,5729356,4,0,Aloisius,,,"<i>Wow, it seems most of the comment here, as of now, decided to overlook the parts of the article that explicitly state problems that are most suffered by women. For example, how this woman had a boss who stroke her hair, or how another boss hated to hire women. That kind of pressure does not exist for most men in the industry.</i><p>I think the problem really is that those examples happened to her nearly 30 years ago and then she goes on to say, ""Women today face a new, more virile and virulent sexism"" because supposedly VCs only fund male hackers.<p>This does not mesh up with many of the collective experiences of those who started working in the last decade or two. It seems impossible that sexism is worse now than it was in the 80s.<p>That isn't to say that sexism doesn't exist. I've run several startups and I'm constantly vigilant towards this stuff. I've had to occasionally call out male employees for making inappropriate comments. They tend towards being sexual rather than sexist, but it always shocks me when it happens. But compared to ongoing physical sexually harassment? I can't see how it could possibly be more poisonous now than thirty years ago.<p>Now it could be that sexism is worse today and the misunderstanding is around how men vs. women classify the severity of various sexist acts. If so, that is an article I'd like to read.",1368897386

It's the same old story (which is disturbing on a few levels). Male programmers will be defensive because they are villains in this anecdote. The article polarized men as evil and women as good, their perspective of reality does not align with this post 2000 femininist narrative, which is why so many bristle at articles like this. However I'm sure male or female programmers can empathize with the misery of a belittle workplace environment. It's frustrating and definitely can urge you to lash out.",1368897321

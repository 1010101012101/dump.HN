230847,comment,230640,230640,0,0,tienshiao,,,"Err.. seemed kind of odd to throw out ""unit conversion"" as an example to discuss.<p>Async programming is basically about doing other things when you would have been waiting for the result with a largely idle CPU (when you would otherwise be blocking).<p>In the context of a single program or Twisted, the blocking times would be primarily related to I/O.. the machine on the other end of the network connection, or potentially your storage system. Using an example of ""unit conversion"" that is largely assumed to be CPU bound is a poor choice since the blocking code does not leave you with free CPU.<p>In the context of CPU bound problems and larger system, like a render farm or image processing done by picture hosting sites, async programming is about farming out work to other workers without waiting for the prior worker to return. You could use Twisted implement it, but the situation is orthogonal to the first situation.",1214697043

Think virtual machines for example. There could be several different but still compile to bytecode so you could run all kinds of languages on different VMs and different hardware by making layers.<p>Hmm I will try to get this clearer and post again.

I bid on projects for companies we should have never had access to and I didn't have to lie to do it. Its a positioning game, you position your weakness as strength. For an excellent contemporary example of this see Barack Obama's campaign. Whether you like Obama or not, he has managed to position his relative inexperience as a strength. Similar tricks are possible within a company, NO LYING REQUIRED.<p>It sounds like you're trying to convince yourself that lying as a means to the end is OK. Its a pretty weak argument, or rather excuse to not work hard and do things honestly.<p>The suggestion that what this founder is doing is ""spirited optimism"" is sickening.",1214696162

Support ranges from amazing to nonexistant, but they're all _really_ cheap (except for softlayer, but you get what you pay for..) for lots and lots of transfer - I blow through a few terabytes a month on three servers, think $100/month for 3TB transfer, 250gb hdd, 1.5gb ram which slicehost can't compare to price-wise.<p>Otherwise for me it's a tie between slicehost, dreamhost (because i had a free promo code..) and asmallorange (i have a lifetime account).

The service is really top notch.<p>a) Communication: they actually speak English, you aren't forwarded to some call center in India<p>b) Response: If you call someone, will pick up within 3 rings. If you email you'll get the first response after 5 minutes. They really are around 24/7. I once needed something done at 3:30 am, I got a reply to my email in less than 10 minutes.<p>c) Its all managed, you really don't need to know anything about servers. Need a library installed? Just drop them a line, Can't figure out how to setup your server? Drop them a line. And there are no support ticket fees or any other crap like that, that other managed hosts charge.<p>I mean honestly, if Rackspace is any better, there better be some sex involved while I wait for them to fix the server. And with the higher prices Rackspace has, that better be the case.<p>Note: You should really only be using them with dedicated servers, their shared/virtual is a little bit pricey<p>And to those that complain about prices, think to yourself, would you rather get a problem resolved in 20 minutes, or 20 hours.",1214694169

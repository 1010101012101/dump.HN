I believe that Wirth’s ultimate impact will be felt even stronger ten years\nfrom now than it is today, and that the legacy of his accomplished career devoted to\nThe Art of Simplicity will be enduring.</i><p>Simplicity is so underrated in this industry. I once went on an interview, where the developers at the company, insisted that I had to know every obscure detail of a languadge to be a master. To which I replied that clever code does not make it elegant code and by opting for fringe programming practices, over simpler more elegant solutions, that they where, in fact, unnecessarily complication their development process. The lesson seemed to go over their head and needless to say they where not interested in my advice. It's funny, in my experience, I have seen the developers that consistently deliver, usually parallel the developers that provide the simplest, most elegant solutions. Gold plating is such a problem in our industry, it is nice to see someone adhere to the doctrine of simplicity. It is an art unto itself.",1325332543

Many that play the start up game do so because first and foremost, there is the chance to earn far more than they can at an organization like Target.

It'll take you 'a while', but it's definitely possible and after that  you can simply count the logic gates you used. Strictly speaking the question is wrong ; what is a simple lisp, what features are required etc etc, then it's answerable by actually designing it from scratch with logic gates. Of course it also will depend on how good you are at actually implementing such basic systems; I've seen CPUs built from logic gates in college which had wildly different numbers of gates between the teams.

3410686,comment,3409809,3410160,0,0,kls,,,"Amazon actually dealt with this problem in a very elegant fashion, at some point they realized that crap cannot be excised from the system, the reality is due to integrations, 3rd party code and legacy that somewhere there is going to be crap. It was at this point that they started to move to a service based architecture in which they could isolate all business functions into black boxes or services. This way instead of having a monolithic crappy application you have disparate services with some good and some bad. Further they have service teams that are accountable to their business units for the quality of their code. So what they now had was a way to gauge very discrete units based on performance to identify bad solutions, it allowed them to surgically upgrade those areas while not affecting the rest of the system. They where able to replace those pieces of the system, by just ensuring that new solutions conformed to the old service contracts. I know that enterprise solutions don't get a lot of love here on HN because it is not the focus but SOA and by extension REST are very important technologies that help deal with the problem that you highlighted.

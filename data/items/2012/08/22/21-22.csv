Through a combination of dialogue and exposition accessible to anyone who has some interest in mathematics, ""Outside In"" builds up to the grand finale: Bill Thurston's ``corrugations'' method of turning the sphere inside out. Along the way, the narrators discuss the related case of closed curves and why they generally cannot be turned inside out. Everyday analogies such as train tracks, belts, smiles and frowns are used throughout, all richly animated and complete with sound effects.</i>  (quoted from <a href=""http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/outreach/oi/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/outreach/oi/</a> )",1345672795

But on the other hand, my username and password were certainly not required to solve the problem (maybe look at the headers of the mis-directed emails first?)<p>The experience left me severely unimpressed with Network Solutions. but perhaps I'm over-reacting?

4419808,comment,4416994,4418079,2,0,_delirium,,,"I think that's right, but I do think it's also changeable, and that there is demand for more product-focused news. Part of the problem (imo, of course) is that funding-related news is just easier journalism: reporting a funding round is often a very loose gloss on a press release, while reviewing products requires work to identify which products are worth reviewing, how they should best be approached, maybe even data analysis.<p>I think people would read that if there were more of it, though. People on HN do vote up even fairly cursory product-focused articles when they appear, e.g. a blog post doing a comparison of Heroku and a competitor. I see the funding-related stories as more just a least-effort excuse to talk about a startup: someone (usually TechCrunch) doesn't really have the time to spare doing a proper product review, but throws out a little blurb about funding, and opens up the floor for discussion about the startup. That then gets voted up on HN because people are curious and want to discuss it, and the TC blurb presents an opportunity to do so, even if it isn't itself that compelling as an article.<p>Now if TC gets the same hits from those low-effort articles, why would they put in <i>Consumer Reports</i> style work doing more in-depth product-focused reporting? I would guess there's little monetary justification for doing so, unfortunately.",1345672407

I don't think that misses the point though, because this thread is specifically discussing the use of FactoryGirl in <i>unit</i> tests. Where I disagree with you is on the importance of definitions. I think it's important to understand the definition of a unit test vs an integration test vs a system test, because without agreeing on those definitions, we don't stand a chance of having a reasonable discussion. If we have different definitions for a word, then our arguments will be talking past each other.<p><i>> Tests and code don't always fall into these neat cult buckets we've drawn up for ourselves.</i><p>(I'll ignore the loaded language, because that's not conducive to rational discussion.) From this point on, you use the word ""tests"" instead of ""unit tests,"" and your points are valid because you're talking about the broader category of tests. I'm not. I'm specifically discussing unit tests, which has been the topic of discussion for this entire thread, going all the way up to the top-level comment by indrekju.<p><i>> because every single codebase is different for a variety of reasons</i><p>I agree with you here. Every codebase is different, and so are their testing requirements. For small gems, I tend to write all integration tests with few unit tests. For larger Rails projects, I write mostly unit tests with some integration tests to catch the cases where an interface changed but I forgot to update a fake object. If you're saying that different codebases differ in their relative requirements of different types of tests (unit vs integration, etc), then I agree. In fact, I would take that a step further, and say the testing requirements also depend on the team. But if you're arguing that the definition of a unit test changes depending on the codebase's testing requirements, then I can't agree.<p>I'm not refuting the usefulness of FactoryGirl in integration, system, or acceptance tests. Just unit tests.<p>Having definitions for jargon gives us tools to learn and discuss things at a more abstract level. That doesn't necessitate applying those ideas dogmatically. If anything, I think it helps you understand the trade-offs so that you can be pragmatic, because pragmatism depends on understanding.",1345672068

In NA, we're particularly lucky to have fairly fresh drinking water, but in other parts of the world this isn't the case.  However, let's focus on NA for now.<p>Not every city is next to a glacier field, which provides some of the purest water -- mainly because it is from the rain, it is a water source, and because it is difficult to get to it which limits its pollution.  The majority of people drink water that is provided by rivers and reservoirs.  These sites are easy to get to, which means it is also easy to pollute them with (a) boats, (b) nature, (c) industrial pollutants... the list goes on.  The farther the water travels, the more likely it is that it will pick up pollutants.<p>The water that comes out of your tap has some fairly strict healthy and safety laws attached to it, keeping it fairly pure to drink.  Even then, there are a lot of nasty bugs in there.  Just about every household tap requires water to be potable, which means safe for human consumption.  That water you are washing your car with?  Drinking water.  Sure, it doesn't taste Brita-fresh, but you can still drink it without getting dysentery.<p>So....my point to all this is that access to fresh, clean drinking water is actually very difficult and expensive, and is best thought of as a modern world luxury.  If we're putting most of that water into crops and food that will be wasted, we're slowly slitting our own throat and wasting a luxury.  All the while, more and more people are occupying the same piece of land, increasing the load on the fresh water supply.<p>Great invention of all time?  Sewage systems.  Before that, people used to throw EVERYTHING into the same place where they drank.  There's a reason people preferred to live upstream.  There's also a reason why everyone pre-1900s used to drink beer or tea (heat kills most water-borne diseases).<p>Edit: I forgot to mention groundwater aquifers as a water source, but my point stands.",1345671722

Which means that right now it's just more efficient to keep using gas and oil.<p>If the price of water keeps going up due to steadily increasing demand, eventually it becomes profitable to burn oil to power desalination.  If we use enough oil to make a dent in <i>its</i> supply, then the price of oil will go up too, until oil-based power sources are more expensive than solar panels, at which point people will start building solar panels to power desalination plants.  Since solar panels are mostly made of silicon (the second most common element on Earth) we're probably not going to run out of them anytime in the next few hundred years, at which point we'll probably be mining asteroids and switching to cold fusion power.

Good luck to you.<p>Of course, as ideas go, I allowed myself to think further into the possibilities, and found some interesting avenues.<p>For instance, why allow the facebooks, twitters, etc to own domain over our content?  Let people store their own data, and offer API endpoints giving facebook, twitter, etc access.  They essentially become frontends and search engines to our shared content.  We get control of our own data (and privacy therein), they get to provide an interface to that data in a way that fits what they're trying to offer their ""customers"".<p>And then if you take that even further, why allow anyone control over your data?  Why not store all my purchase data and credit info on my own servers, and allow authorized companies access as needed?  Census time?  Popup shows up on my phone asking if i'd like to allow the government access to some of my data for census - I pick what data is allowed, and it's done.<p>Electric company's system automatically logs in to get my electric usage.  Phone provider does the same.  Publishing a book literally allows access by readers to your own servers.  Releasing an album - same deal.  We still have ""stores"", but those stores are merely search engines offering a service to both the content creators and consumers.<p>It went further, and weirder (in interesting ways).  I'm not sure such a system would truly be beneficial, but I love the idea of allowing people to Truly Own their own data.<p>Apologies for the tangent.  Good luck to you.

For each type of drug, there is usually some agreed on metric within the field that determines what constitutes clinical significance. E.g. a blood pressure drug might have to lower blood pressure by 5% or 10% or whatever. And often times the metric isn't even relevant, as in the case of a reduction in blood pressure vs. a reduction in total mortality / morbidity.<p>However, at the end of the day what the academic community considers clinically significant doesn't really matter, it's your own preferences and values that should be your guide.

No meat, eggs or fish  so more eco-friendly. Could contain nuts and milk products.

4419570,comment,4419030,4419030,36,0,edanm,,,"This. Is. AWESOME. Let me tell you what this is useful for by telling you my story:<p>I'm a pretty fast typist (80-100WPM on TypeRacer, usually) and I really never put much thought into my typing, since it was good enough. But I recently started paying attention to the kinds of mistake I make on Typeracer, and realized that I have certain combinations of keys which I don't make using the ""home row"" of the keyboard, but rather, move my hands to make. Every time I hit one of these, I have a 50/50 chance of not getting back to the home row correctly, meaning I have a 50/50 chance of throwing off my typing.<p>And I am a heavy VIM user, by the way, which means I am very used to doing <i>everything</i> from the home row, including every navigation you can think of. I even have AutoHotKey scripts to give me vim-style navigation everywhere in windows, so I never have to move my hands.<p>Now with this program, I finished running an example and noticed 2 shocking things:<p>1. There are a lot of keys which I'm not used to typing from the homerow, which happen to show up a lot in regular Python code. For example, periods (.). And underscores. I was used to shifting my hand to type these characters. I don't notice this during every day work, since I'm actually programming, but I <i>did</i> notice this while playing a program specifically designed for typing.<p>2. At the end of the program, it gives you statistics, and I found out that I was only about 48% effective, meaning 52% of the keystrokes I made were accidents that had to be backspaced out. This is a <i>lot</i>. Part of it is ""first time with this program"" bias, but it still means I have a long way to go.<p>Anyway, I recommend running through this program, it will probably teach you a lot.<p>P.S. Just one bit of constructive criticism: the way the program presents mis-types is a little annoying, and hard to follow. I recommend doing the same as TypeRacer, that is, have the ""mistaken"" keystrokes be visible somewhere, so the typist is very clear on how many keys he needs to backspace out. This is much closer to how people type in the real world.",1345669518

The waste is at all levels of the food supply chain, from producer to consumer.<p>There was an excellent special on Food Network called ""The Big Waste"" that looked into this, by way of a cooking competition. Here's the description:<p>--------<p>First class chefs Bobby Flay, Michael Symon, Anne Burrell and Alex Guarnaschelli tackle one of the most massive problems in food today - waste! Divided into two teams, with only 48 hours on the clock, they are challenged to create a multi course gourmet banquet worthy of their great reputations, but with a big twist; they can only use food that is on its way to the trash. The chefs' hunt takes them from grocery aisles to produce farms, and orchard lines to garbage piles, as they attempt to source enough ingredients to feed a gathering crowd. Bobby and Michael square off against Anne and Alex, as they challenge their views of food waste and how and why it is created.<p>--------<p>Some examples of things I remember them finding and using (I may not be remembering these completely accurately, so if someone else watched it, please jump in with corrections):<p> Fruit at an orchard that was sized or shaped wrong and so was missed by the automated harvesting machines<p> Fish at a fish market that was bruised or damaged.<p> Cuts of meat that weren't used in any of the items in a restaurant that did its own butchering.<p> Produce from markets that was old enough to have lost some color. It's still fine culinarily, especially for any dish where it isn't important for the presentation, but it doesn't sell well compared to the colorful stuff so the markets clear it out to make room. (I believe this was the food that the blurb is talking about from garbage piles--although the chefs did not actually get it from garbage piles. They got it from the market employees who were carrying it out to dump it on the garbage pile).<p>It was quite revealing. The chefs produced meals that would have been quite at home on the menus at any top fine dining restaurant, all with food that was considered waste before it ever reached a consumer.",1345669402

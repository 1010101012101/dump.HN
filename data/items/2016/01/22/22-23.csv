10956089,comment,10938593,10942125,0,0,Grishnakh,,,"I&#x27;m sorry, I have to disagree about micropayments.  For most people (including people in finance), micropayments are anything less than 1 dollar.  $0.25 is most definitely a micropayment.  The reason is simple: with any payment processor, your per-transaction fee is something like $0.30 + 3% of the transaction.  So a $0.30 sale nets you zero, because it&#x27;s all taken up by the fee, and anything less than that will cost you money.  For transactions under a few dollars, these fees are absolutely prohibitive.<p>So even for things worth a quarter, a real micropayment system would be a boon.<p>Now, the problem with things like Blendle, the iTunes store, etc., is that even with my definition of micropayments, they&#x27;re not that useful, because they lock you into that vendor: you have to have an account with them, and you basically have a &quot;tab&quot; with them (much like going to a bar) that you build up, and eventually get billed for and pay all at once, so that they don&#x27;t get socked with giant fees.  This, obviously, only favors large players: Apple can afford to sell you $1 movies and songs this way, because it keeps you coming back to their store, but this doesn&#x27;t help sellers who want to sell stuff on their own, outside of some giant player like that (who of course takes a gigantic cut of the proceeds for selling on their store).<p>A <i>real</i> micropayment system would let buyers and sellers exchange pennies at a time, with extremely low fees.  PayPal got us a little closer to this by letting small sellers easily establish an account and get money from buyers (using their credit cards), without having to pay huge fees for a traditional merchant account.  But PayPal gets socked with the same fees from Visa/MC as everyone and passes them on, so you still have to pay the same $0.30+3% per transaction.  A micropayment system would have to bypass Visa/MC altogether.  We&#x27;ll never have micropayments, or lower fees of any kind, as long as we&#x27;re stuck with the Visa/MC cartel.",1453503251

Before <i>computers</i> existed, all of a person&#x27;s personal information was likely held on paper somewhere, either on their person or in their car or home or bank. At worst, the papers of a dead person would be locked in a safe—and law enforcement could always get a subpoena to have a safe cracked open.<p>Computers made the safe figurative, but FDE made the safe uncrackable, and put everything the person owns in there rather than just the stuff they think needs protecting. We really <i>did</i> lose something, and it&#x27;s not just convenience for law enforcement; many people&#x27;s entire life histories now evaporate upon their death, having been held entirely as digital artifacts on FDEed devices.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what to <i>do</i> about that. <i>Manufacturer</i> key escrow is obviously not the solution. I have a feeling that having a culture of <i>peer</i> key escrow might be, though. Teaching children that having escrowed backup keys is important, in the same way that having an emergency contact number for hospitalization is important, might help quite a bit. (We could also teach them the value of good passwords, while we&#x27;re wishing for a pony.)",1453502893

The real challenge is getting around the Bank Holding Company Act with respect to raising capital. Basically, if any entity has a significant stake in a US bank (5-10% can trigger this) they are subject to BHCA which includes scrutiny from federal regulators (Plural!) over your books and a legal duty to bail the bank out. Our idea around this, consulting with a top financial attorney and consulting firm, was to get a consortium of wealthy individuals who would not exceed the limits individually and wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;acting in concert&quot; with each other (which also triggers BHCA).<p>But even after this, any major shift in the bank&#x27;s operations, including a re-architecture of technology is subject to regulatory oversight, similar to de novo status. Also, not to mention background checks from not only the FBI but also the CIA. Replacing management (which you probably want to do) is also a major change in bank operations. You also need a CEO who the regulators approve, and has previous CEO-level experience at another charter. We also had someone like this lined up.<p>We got pretty far in this process, but decided to put our efforts elsewhere. Seems ST did as well. Curious if you&#x27;ve found the same things, happy to chat further about what we learned (email in profile).<p>Edit: Of course, all the fun begins once you successfully acquire a charter. The real business in acquiring a bank is not to make money on loans. It turns out, despite the monopolistic access to cheap capital from depositors, non-bank lenders do a much better job at making high margin risk-adjusted loans (see <a href=""https://foundationcapital.com/fcideasfintech"" rel=""nofollow"">https://foundationcapital.com/fcideasfintech</a>).

Not someone I want on my team.&quot; - it sounds like the kind of people who&#x27;re using react would be sad about that.<p>This post is evidently about <i>junior</i> developers, just because something is old/established doesn&#x27;t make it right or that it shouldn&#x27;t be questioned, because there&#x27;s usually a better way.",1453500054

I did not mean that a new language should have a feature that can <i>literally</i> not be done anywhere else.  I meant: what are the uncommon features?  What sets this language apart from the (dominant) other langs?<p>As someone else pointed out, in golang this would be goroutines or channels or golang&#x27;s approach to composition vs inheritance.  You can certainly implement those in another language, but they&#x27;re not first-class features in most other langs.  Put together, those elements give golang it&#x27;s characteristic flavor.<p>For this new lang, I&#x27;m interested in learning (as early in the docs as possible) what sets it apart from C, C++, golang, python, ruby, JS, haskell, erlang, D, etc.  The hello world example teaches the reader something, but it&#x27;s not the thing a person first landing on that page probably cares about.<p>And going back to my original statement, there&#x27;s lots of things that are still missing from programming langs and associated ecosystems.  Just look at JS, and how even today people are still furiously trying to extend it and work around it just to build simple reactive websites.",1453500018

In hardware, when you&#x27;re under a lot of pressure to be deliver products on time, teams will be risk averse and over design to meet timing. As time goes on, engineering learns of the over design, or over capacity, and corrects the issue to save cost or optimize performance. This becomes an issue when teams trade off performance for cost.",1402804527
7894324,comment,7893839,7893893,3,0,graycat,,,"Newton&#x27;s law of gravity?  Worked great for, what, 300+ years?  Still, for a wide range of situations, it&#x27;s darned accurate.  Is it &#x27;correct&#x27;?  Nope:  Einstein&#x27;s law of gravity is more accurate, especially in what in our solar system neighborhood would have to be regarded as extreme situations.<p>Are we sure that Einstein&#x27;s law of gravity is the really &#x27;correct&#x27; one or the &#x27;last&#x27; one we will discover?  Nope.  Indeed, that doubt is part of why the article got so excited about using one black hole orbiting another one to &quot;test&quot; Einstein&#x27;s law of gravity.  We keep testing that law because we will learn something, either (1) something doesn&#x27;t fit and we have to ditch the law or (2) the law fits and we gain more &#x27;confidence&#x27; in the law.<p>You can look at it this way:  The stuff we &#x27;accept&#x27; now is what we have dreamed up and that has passed some apparently &#x27;significant&#x27; (don&#x27;t mean statistics here) tests and so far never really failed a test.  Net, stuff &#x27;accepted&#x27; at present is what appears to work so far.<p>But, in physics and cosmology, we have some issues that, at least intuitively, appear to be potential biggies:  (1) What happened before the big bang?  Can we get some clues from the data we have on what might have happened before the big bang -- some physicists have tried to look.  (2) What&#x27;s with this stuff about dark energy and dark matter?  (3) Why does it appear that there is much more matter than anti-matter?  (4) What&#x27;s with neutrinos and how they &#x27;change&#x27;?  (5) What can we dig out of &#x27;spooky action at a distance&#x27;, that is, Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox?<p>So, maybe more progress understanding one of these biggies will cause us to ditch some of our currently &#x27;accepted&#x27; results, look for, and maybe find some new results.<p>Could everything we have seen so far be just some light show put on just for our amusement?  We can&#x27;t say.  So far, it appears that somehow mathematics works shockingly well; why?  We don&#x27;t know.<p>That there is a law of gravity that works as well as even Newton&#x27;s might be seen as surprising.  That is, why doesn&#x27;t\nthe &#x27;law of gravity&#x27; change each 10 minutes?  Well, some things do change &#x27;randomly&#x27;, and for them the only laws we have are probabilistic.  Newton&#x27;s law is not probabilistic because so far it appears to work the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow, that is, doesn&#x27;t change.  Or our science is what we have found that in some important sense doesn&#x27;t change, e.g., we can &#x27;reproduce&#x27; results.  Why are such results possible?  Not at all clear.<p>Even if what we are seeing is just some light show for our amusement, still we get some utility, e.g., via applications to engineering, etc.  So, the Internet works because Maxwell&#x27;s equations of electro-magnetism continue to work as they have for 100+ years now.<p>> And I can&#x27;t shake it off.<p>Relax and enjoy the light show or whatever the heck it is.  There&#x27;s a lot to be amazed about, curious about, etc.  And we really do make progress, astounding progress.  E.g., we&#x27;ve made a lot of progress since I studied physics i college.  The math I studied has been more stable!",1402804485

7894317,comment,7893568,7894246,0,0,mpyne,,,"> Andreessen took the concept of &quot;shooting the messenger&quot; to new depths of stupidity when he said that.<p>And yet, not really. With the exception of RSA, American tech. companies are being hammered for the actions of NSA, not for their own &quot;crimes&quot;. Even German companies obey German legal directives after all, and Vodafone made clear the other day the extent of government monitoring of networks around the world.<p>To the extent that Snowden has made clear the reality that government (and not just criminals) can take advantage of the jurisdictional problems of an open Internet, that&#x27;s not the fault of the U.S. tech sector either. After all, some of the most successful NSA programs are really liaisons with European security agencies that run the actual intake work, not conspiracies with Silicon Valley.<p>The correct solution for Europe if they want to be free of the possibility of other nations (incl. the USA) doing targeted operations in their networks is to completely balkanize the Internet, which companies like Google and Facebook oppose for obvious reasons.<p>You can credit Snowden with revealing to the world the types of dangers inherent to an open Internet, but that very same set of revelations is a large part of what&#x27;s harming the U.S. tech sector. You&#x27;re right that people may have figured it out eventually, but nations and companies around the world tended to agree not to make too big an issue of it since the benefits of an open Internet were thought to outweigh the risks. But Snowden forced the issue.<p>The only true solution to the issues he raised, if you&#x27;re a European citizen, cannot be left to voluntary compliance by the other nations of the world, especially since you can never certify compliance with that. You&#x27;d have to instead build out your own Facebook, your own Google, your own tech sector, just like Russia and China have done.<p>So credit Snowden with opening the eyes of Europe to that reality, but you can&#x27;t eat your cake and have it too. We&#x27;ve seen region locking spread too far with just with RIAA/MPAA to want to see it infect the rest of the Internet, but <i>that</i> is the message Snowden is responsible for (even if it wasn&#x27;t the message he meant to send).",1402804180

Does it need to be formally documented in a particular way? Do I need to involve a legal professional? If some issues do not need to be addressed at the very beginning, then when should they be addressed?<p>Are there standard procedures/recommendations that should be followed?

Beyond familiarity with Applicative, the author also assumes the reader has facility with Controller, Fold, Managed, View, the Pipes library, Lens, and a host of functions I had never seen, such as last (not the Prelude version), stdinLines, tick, and runMVC. Assuming this, he throws out the definition of Updatable on top of that like it makes perfect sense (&quot;just a Fold sitting in front of a Managed Controller&quot;. Oh, well then.). Basically, two or three paragraphs in and I am already completely lost. I don&#x27;t even know what problem it is we&#x27;re trying to solve, and I have no idea what it has to do at all with spreadsheets.<p>This is one of the downsides of Haskell; with so much emphasis on abstraction, code often ends up being just that: so damn abstract that it&#x27;s practically inscrutable except to the very few who are familiar with what&#x27;s going on. I guess this article was written for an audience with very broad and detailed knowledge of some complicated Haskell libraries -- meaning it&#x27;s not so important that anyone else be able to make head or tails out of what he&#x27;s talking about. Which is ok, but it does add to the impression that Haskell is an exclusive club.<p>Also, this part sticks out as confusing: The type signature of `example` does not include IO (unless Updatable has IO on under the hood), and yet the language above suggests that it will change, i.e. that it is mutable:<p>> example will update every time lastLine or seconds updates, caching and reusing portions that do not update. For example, if lastLine updates then only the first field of Example will change. Similarly, if seconds updates then only the second field of Example will change.<p>Can someone clear this up for me?",1402802180

7894239,comment,7893468,7894166,1,0,vidarh,,,"Sorry, I missed that bit - I just briefly skimmed through the pages and noticed I recognized a couple of them. There is also a big series of collections of the newspaper strips that continued at least up until 1993, according to Wikipedia, and I assumed this was simply one of those. But yes, that&#x27;s clearly different.<p>> There&#x27;s anyway lots of not so super U.S. comics, stuff like &quot;Archie&quot; or &quot;Duck Tales&quot; would be big ones.<p>There&#x27;s lots of them, but they are &quot;special interest&quot; that are published in tiny little runs for the most part, and most of them don&#x27;t get much retail distribution (at least not any more). Archie being the closest to an extant &quot;mainstream&quot; non-superhero series (Archie is also reprinted in Scandinavia, but has never been a big seller), but even Archie is tiny: The main Archie title sold for <30k/month as of a few years ago.<p>Duck Tales is an interesting one to bring up, as it belongs to a separate tradition: The cartoon spin-off. There&#x27;s lots of them, but most of them don&#x27;t sell very well, and few of them get translated much. The Duck Tales stories do get published in Scandinavia, but as far as I understand they sell tiny amounts compared to the weekly Donald & Co magazine.<p>>  I sort of wonder how much U.S. stuff is being recycled into the books you are talking about. I don&#x27;t mean I think it is for sure happening, I actually mean I wonder about how much it happens.<p>Most of it does, for any series that gains traction. There are certainly US series that doesn&#x27;t make it (but the US editions will be for sale in any comic shop), but for the ones that do, pretty much every single thing that gets printed in the US makes it to the European editions.  E.g. Beetle Bailey has been published about monthly from the mid 70&#x27;s in Norway, increasing to 3 times a month in the 80&#x27;s, and twice a week for about the last 20 years - they&#x27;ve published <i>every</i> little scrap of Bettle Bailey material they&#x27;ve managed to dig up, and still the magazine is mostly re-runs and side series, and this is fairly typical.<p>Usually the death-knell for these magazines is that they simply &quot;run dry&quot;. Calvin and Hobbes for example, kept going for a few years after Watterson stopped drawing, but unlike Beetle Bailey, his ten year run was simply too short to give them the same kind of flexibility in ongoing extensive re-runs, as the target audience would know and remember almost everything they&#x27;d print.<p><i>On top of</i> publishing whatever they can get from the US editions the European publishers often commission extra material to help fill the generally higher page count editions, or special additional series. E.g. there&#x27;s a long standing &quot;Donald Pocket&quot; series where the majority of books are written specifically for various European regional markets by European artists. And the Scandinavian Donald magazines includes a lot of specially commissioned stories from artists like Don Rosa (US) that are often not published in the US because there&#x27;s no outlet for them (Don Rosa have had a few stories published in US comic books, but the US Disney comics sales keeps imploding every few years leading to repeated mass cancellations)<p>To get back to Beetle Bailey, there&#x27;s another interesting example: The Scandinavian magazines regularly publishes draft strips that Walker or his assistants found too rude to expect to be accepted by his US publisher due to language (sexual innuendo, bodily functions etc.) or nudity.",1402801542

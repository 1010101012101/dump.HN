This city is awake and alive with hustle and bustle 24/7! Citizens use businesses, homes, parks, etc. for work and play, and these all cost you money to maintain. The happier the little people are in their habitat, the harder they will work, and the more profit you will make from them. Well-maintained cities can encourage more citizens to move in there. This will not only increase your population, but also your city size... and your profit margin. Cities that are neglected or not well-maintained will cease growing, or slowly deteriorate until they are nothing but piles of rubble. Using the various ""disasters"" (including a tornado option) can do that in much less time. ;) So to maximize your worker's output, keep all structures ""refurbished"". Your citizens may even help you do that on occasion too. And if you need more help, ask The Gardener. :)<p>The citizens also need power from the Power Plant to do any expanding. The Power Plant started in the ""ON"" position, but you can ""Power it down"" (by clicking on it) to stop your city from growing any further, and to keep your daily profits/costs stabilized (good for those that like the small town feel). ""Power it up"" again to allow for potential growth to resume (good for those that like the larger city life). City costs, profits and growth (if any) are calculated each midnight (between 11:55pm and 12:05am).<p>Lastly, click here for a few Slice City Gameplay Tips. If you come up with a good one, let us know and we can add to the list. We also have extra addon objects for you on our Slice City Addons Page. We sincerely hope you enjoy this, and if you have any questions or comments, please contact us :)<p>It even has its own add-ons:<p><a href=""http://www.simslice.com/Slicecityaddons.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.simslice.com/Slicecityaddons.htm</a>",1331153899

I understand it may sound aggresive.<p>Pangool is based on an extension of the MapReduce model we suggest and call ""Tuple MapReduce"". This is explained in detail in this post: <a href=""http://www.datasalt.com/2012/02/tuple-mapreduce-beyond-the-classic-mapreduce/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datasalt.com/2012/02/tuple-mapreduce-beyond-the-c...</a><p>What this means is that in Pangool, if you worked with 2-sized Tuples, you would be able to do exactly the same that you do now with Java MapReduce - That includes custom RawComparators and arbitrary business logic in any place of the MapReduce chain (Mapper, Combiner, Reducer). Using n-sized Tuples together with Pangool's group & sort by, reduce-side join API will only mean less code, easier code at no loss of performance or flexibility.<p>Realize that Pangool is still a MapReduce API so it doesn't add any level of abstraction.<p>We designed Pangool with the aim of offering it as a replacement of the current MapReduce API. Therefore we are not labelling it as a ""higher-level API"" but as comparable low-level API.<p>On the other hand we are also benchmarking Pangool to show it doesn't impose a performance overhead: <a href=""http://pangool.net/benchmark.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pangool.net/benchmark.html</a>",1331150430

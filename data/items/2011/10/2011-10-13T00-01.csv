3105476,comment,3104910,3105146,7,0,OpieCunningham,,,"Your comment reminds me of a discussion I've had regarding hybrid vehicles. The argument against hybrid vehicles, the Prius in that case, was that for less money a more efficient vehicle (to operate and manufacture), such as a Honda Civic, could be purchased. The conclusion was therefore: it was a waste of money to pay for a Toyota Prius (the further conclusion was that the primary or sole rationale for purchasing a Prius was vanity). My argument was that by purchasing the Prius you would not be making a wise short-term personal financial decision, but you would be supporting the fledgling hybrid industry. The result would then be a faster growth cycle of the hybrid industry, decreasing costs and promotion of the industry beyond just the Prius line, affecting greater efficiency across multiple manufacturers and models.<p>If your goal is to support the open standards based social networking industry, financial support for Diaspora may not result in Diaspora becoming a credible Facebook competitor, but it will assist in the longer term development of open standards based social networking.",1318467406

So there are two design considerations: wireless or non-wireless. dummy non-wireless things are that interesting, so i guess you're going to want to design a wireless device.<p>GainSpan designs Wi-Fi modules and the whole software ecosystem. You could prototype things pretty quickly as they already design the whole chip-level firmware and application-level software that goes into building a prototype.<p>what's really neat about GainSpan chips/systems/software is that they built everything from ground up, so their software is optimized for the embedded space. Sure you could take an ARM-core and design the whole circuit board, and etc, but why would you want to do that?<p>once you get started, you will then probably realize that to differentiate your prototype is the software and not the hardware. if your wireless device can't perform the correct provisioning mechanism to communicate with the router, you're going to have to spend a lot of time on that too.<p>well, anyway, I have to disclose that I used to work for a Wi-Fi chip company before we got acquired and I still sometimes do consulting at GainSpan. check out the website and get an evaluation kit to start tinkering. the EVK is fairly inexpensive and it'll help you understand the design process.<p>best\nlien",1318467347

3105466,comment,3104175,3104175,1,0,bxc,,,"Now I don't really know how well it works in practice but the european model for VAT (the rough equivalent of sales tax) is basically this: if you're a small business, you don't have to collect VAT for the place you're sending the goods; but if you don't, you have to collect it for your own location (rather than collecting nothing). And over a certain business size, you <i>do</i> have to collect it for the destination.<p>The EU has fairly uniform VAT rates (around 20%), so then there isn't a huge difference to where you charge the tax, and so end consumer prices don't vary by a huge amount.<p>Maybe the much more variable rates in the US plus what seems to be more easier ability to move jurisdictions would lead to sales tax jurisdiction shopping a more than in europe.",1318467214
3105465,comment,3103831,3104673,2,0,Zak,,,"Of the languages I mentioned, only Haskell is functional, though I'll concede that Common Lisp isn't very likely to become mainstream either.<p>Lua, on the other hand is a relatively procedural scripting language. It can support functional programming if you want (it has closures and tail-call elimination), but that isn't the default. It doesn't even have map/reduce/filter in the standard library (I think it should).<p>I also dispute your claim fundamentally. Research-oriented languages like Haskell probably won't go mainstream, but a mostly-functional paradigm is very natural for web development. A GET request is naturally a pure function (it takes an HTTP request and returns a page). A POST can often be purely functional except for the bit at the end where it creates, updates or deletes a value.

3105389,comment,3104591,3104591,12,0,dcaranda,,,"Paul Graham's response is two things... disappointing and misleading.<p>What makes his response disappointing is that this is a great, old debate.  Cloudant is developing potentially breakthrough technology (""Our founders first devised our open-source platform BigCouch while at MIT, working on Large Hadron Collider experiments generating millions of data points per second from the collision of atomic particles"") to perform complex tasks (""the analysis & identification of new traits & genomic combinations in agricultural crops"").  When have important technologies been developed for less than warm and fuzzy purposes?  Without the Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic bomb, we wouldn't have modern forms of cancer treatment.  GPS was developed to give more precision to submarine-launched ballistic missiles.  There are other examples of equal importance.  Is it right? Is it worth it?  Whatever the answer - it deserves a thoughtful response.<p>What makes his response misleading is that he conflates the levels of involvement in the client/customer's work.<p>Apple computers, Chevy cars and Clorox cleaning supplies - are all mass produced goods.  They are not custom products for specific clients for a specific purpose.  It appears Cloudant is doing this for Monsanto... therefore, the purpose matters.  The press release states that Cloudant has been ""working with"" Monsanto ""for a few weeks"" on ""the partnership"".  Furthermore, Cloudant's custom work is mission-critical to Monsanto's business: ""Were not powering the CMS of some administrative division or a minor part of their website. Cloudants BigCouch will be the core, for both storage and analysis of a new, company-wide platform powering a fundamental aspect of a Fortune 500 business: the analysis & identification of new traits & genomic combinations in agricultural crops"".  This isn't the same company/customer relationship as buying Clorox.  The purpose of developing genetically modified agricultural crops and hormones is central to the relationship between Cloudant and Monsanto. Again, the purpose matters.<p>Paul Graham says: ""If the rule is, if x sells something to Monsanto, fuck x, then what youre saying is fuck the entire corporate world"".  Maybe that's right.  When the American people decided they didn't agree with the Apartheid regime of the South African government, the Congress and Republican-controlled Senate passed the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 and they stopped selling to them.  I'm not saying what Monsanto is doing is apartheid - I'm saying that if you disagree with somebody, not selling to them has been an effective responsive.<p>Unfortunately for those that disagree with the development of genetically modified agricultural crops and hormones, there's not much that can really be done beyond not buying these goods unless there's government action that limits interactions with these companies.  But if you disagree, then you can do as Paul Graham suggests in his essay ""The Patent Pledge"": ""Now there's something any individual can do about this problem, without waiting for the government: ask companies where they stand.""",1318466158

Our goal was to simplify and standardize data access for all front-end features. At that time, this was a monumental task as most features lacked common code besides the infamous MaintenanceConfig. There was basic SQL call wrappers for querying data and some core handling of the large number of federated profile/mail DBs, but besides that, features tended to be built ad hoc.<p>This posed a problem to scaling the massive web traffic load on these databases. It also left open dangerous patterns of duplicate data calls where each control on a page was making its own calls for the data it would bind to.<p>Man... I could go on for days about the path we took from the wild wild west of code slinging up to the nice accessible, maintainable, freakin' BEAUTIFUL Server Slayer platform.

I don't mean to pooh-pooh this effort (which I would like to see happen), but the general feeling I've gotten from folks in the scientific Python community is that introducing a JIT is not going to be a magical solution for our performance problems, especially considering that many scientific Python programmers are already programming very close to the metal with Cython (or wrapping Fortran 90 with f2py). I didn't come up with this-- I'm just rehashing conversations I had at PyCodeConf last week.

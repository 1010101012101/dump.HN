7456951,comment,7456379,7456379,3,0,evv,,,"Adding a basic DRM to coffee pods would be trivial for Keurig to implement. There is no need for RFID on each pod. That would be a waste of money in my opinion.<p>They can simply print a unique QR code on the bottom of each pod, and the Keurig machine could read it with a cheap webcam. The content of the data would be an encrypted message, signed with Keurig&#x27;s secret key. They sign one unique message for each pod. The machine can remember all the messages it has seen, and refuse to brew any duplicates.<p>Granted, this isn&#x27;t impossible to circumvent. The secret key could get leaked, but at least thats a known vulnerability. There is one more obvious weakness: every code can be used once on each machine, and not just the one that brewed the authentic code. IE, if a counterfeit outfit buys one thousand real pods, they could then distribute up to 1k pods to each customer which would act as authentic. Fortunately, this is a pain that will probably slow the production of fake pods and persuade customers to buy authentic ones.<p>This is the only sort of DRM that I would actually be OK with in this instance. It&#x27;s not really a waste of money, and if the DRM-reading system works reliably, it has no negative impact on the user experience.",1395640742

The second part of that example, the ActionBar, which was introduced in ICS, IIRC, only has a <i>community</i> shim. Granted if you want to use a new API that may not have as much community support as the ActionBar, you either code one yourself (strengthening the sedev&#x27;s point that  you have to design the same functionality across multiple versions).<p>Your second point is even more off base. With the web&#x27;s responsive design, I have to make one HTML file, and one CSS file, and if my design is sane, it works across all screen sizes. Your second link requires you to hand code different layouts for every device size which is hardly a solution - infact you are back squarely where you started. And I&#x27;m unsure if you actually read those tutorials but they don&#x27;t even seem to have been updated since <i>eclair</i>. IIRC, you only had to deal with 3 sizes then - ldpi, mdpi, and hdpi. I haven&#x27;t done Android dev in a while, but I&#x27;m sure the number of layouts have tripled.<p>If you really want to counter sedev&#x27;s point, you should point to an app with the relevant code that actually does what sedev is talking about and not some links to the documentation.

It happened to us as well, we spent so much time looking around for additional teammates. We tried those Facebook groups or posted flyers around the UC campus, but they all had disadvantages: Facebook groups requires .edu emails to gain access to, which limited our chances to get in touch with students from other schools and flyers were definitely old and inefficient things that should no longer exist. So, we thought we could build something more useful here, and we created studentquest, a free, student-targeted, multi-campus career website with the hope that it will provides a more efficient platform for college students to engage and collaborate with other individuals (students, professors), school organizations and local businesses, more flexibility/freedom for users and way more organized than the messy flyers we still see everywhere.<p>At first, we thought it would be a quick project since we actually planned to work on something else, but we&#x27;ve ended up spending a considerable amount of time on it. We actually have lots of fun while working on the site.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please take a look at the site: http://studentquest.org.

If you don&#x27;t like using it there are alternatives.<p>I usually use Emacs or vi.  The only thing I miss when not using Eclipse with the ADT plugin is after typing say &quot;LinearLayout ll;&quot; with Eclipse I can type Control-Shift-O and the LinearLayout class is automatically imported in the code.  I miss this, but I kind of have this in Emacs with JDE - a Control-C-V-Z has similar behavior.  I could probably do some more tool work on Emacs and make it even more automatic.<p>I do everything with emacs, vi, ant, astyle, adb, and the Android commands &quot;android&quot; and &quot;monitor&quot;.  Some people do Android in IntelliJ, some in Netbeans.  Some use Sublime Text.<p>If you think Eclipse with ADT is bad for Android development now, you should have seen Eclipse/ADT at the end of 2009.  Just getting the ADT plugin to work with Eclipse was a nightmare.  Having seen the improvement since then, I guess it all seems less bad to me.

The main idea of this article is the overall scalability of these types of companies from a VC / enterprise point of view. $40 million is a lot to me, but pennies to others.<p>With competitors such as Amazon, 40 million in a lot of cases might be 10% or less of the marketshare. Or it is 100% of the market but it is tapped out.<p>Ecommerce is kind of a vast term. I think it is also important to look at if the company drop ships, has inventory, or manufacturers goods in-house. Huge difference there.",1395637478

If by manner you mean &quot;drugs&quot;. Oseltamivir (aka Tamiflu) only works against influenza, so if you have RSV or some other virus, it won&#x27;t do you much good.

I know and have known many who have 30, 35 and 40 years in and stayed in engineering.<p>For development, it&#x27;s all about having your niche. If your niche is stable, age isn&#x27;t an issue. If your niche is going away, there&#x27;s little reason to keep a 50 yr old C cubicle guy to switch to consulting, 50% travel and code the latest flavor. There&#x27;s just no cruising on your laurels anywhere anymore and the market turns over much more quickly.<p>My observation of recent layoffs is that it&#x27;s ageism in that most of the people in these jobs are well into their 50&#x27;s and some into their 60&#x27;s.

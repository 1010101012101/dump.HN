chrisco,0,1,0.0,0,1,"Im the founder of a startup called BuzzPal - The World Is Your Party <a href=""http://www.buzzpal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buzzpal.com</a>.  We're basically a cross between social networking and online dating, with a ""world"" and ""party"" flavor.  Thats about all were saying publically at this time (stealth mode and all).<p>Were currently looking for a few people, especially one technical person with the desire and ability to become a key team member, possibly even a co-founder.  You can learn more on our ""jobs"" page.<p>Were also doing an internship program this summer, which will be located in Gothenburg, Sweden, the second largest city in Sweden, the largest city on the west coast, and home to the largest student population in Sweden.  Gothenburg is also home to Chalmers University of Technology, the top university in Sweden and among the top research schools in Europe.  Weve got a special website for, but you have to register (and you have to qualify).<p>So whats my story?  Im an American from Washington, DC, who went to college in Florida and Colorado, then got my MBA from Georgetown and went into venture debt and equity financing in the TMT sector (technology, media, communications, publishing, and technology).  I cashed out of that startup (in a small way -- employee, not a founder), then went into corporate finance (financing power plants).<p>I then took two years off, moved to Europe, traveled, got married (met my wife on Match.com), and began work on BuzzPal (and StartCo.eu).  I own over 350 domain names -- not to sell, but to develop over time, as we work off the backlog, developing the highest priority names first.  The priority is determined via a matrix that not only considers the name in isolation, but more importantly considers it in relation to the other names -- things like synergies, network effects, economies of scale, opportunities for discovery and to create options and leverageable components.<p>My CV is here: <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/comella"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/in/comella</a>.<p>FUNDING:<p>We are bootstrapping.  I am the founder and lead investor, using my own capital, at least through initial product development, after which time outside capital will be raised to the extent it is needed to accelerate growth beyond what the startup can fund internally.<p>If you wonder why we don't raise VC first, it's because 1) tons of money is not required to launch a startup these days, and 2) we don't believe in that model.  We think it is wasteful in terms of resources and costly in terms of the amount of equity and control you are required to give up for a small amount of funding.<p>We believe in bringing in outside capital only AFTER proof of concept, which in the case of a web application means after it's out there.  It also allows for the possibility that outside capital is not required at all.  Regardless, the strategy is to only sell ownership and control if/when necessary to accelerate growth.<p>Get in touch.  We are looking for contacts in Europe and the USA.  We will consider having people relocate to us or ourselves relocating to them.<p>Cheers,\nchrisco",1206196321,1206196321

He is one of the maintainers of the popular ReactiveUI functional reactive programming MVVM framework.<p>When programming Geoff tends to write in a asynchronous, functional reactive manner using the Reactive Extensions and Xamarin but has been known to ship JavaScript (node.js) and Python. With Xamarin, applications are written entirely in C# or F#, sharing the same core library code on iOS, Android & Windows Phone. Anything you can do in Objective-C, Swift or Java, you can do in .NET with Xamarin to create beautiful native apps.<p>He regularly does presentations on Xamarin technologies and has over 20 years industry experience as a T-shaped individual with deep technology, business and entrepreneurship experience. You will never see death by powerpoint on his watch - minimal, to the point, tied together with effective storytelling. He is comfortable switching between technical and non-technical styles of communication as needed to a variety of audiences.<p>As part of constant and never ending learning, Geoff is actively engaged in contributing to the Xamarin and Microsoft .NET open-source community. Open-source for him is a way of life, when hes not authoring code you will find him building communities, passing down knowledge and mentoring first timers.<p>He lives in Sydney, Australia.<p>If youve got a position in mind or a interesting project you want to get off the ground send an email to ghuntley@ghuntley.com with your requirements for a confidential discussion.",1241157377,1452104476

iheartmemcache,,1115,4.70455,3,225,"Read this:  John C. Baez and Mike Stay, &quot;Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone&quot;, (2009) ArXiv 0903.0340 in New Structures for Physics, ed. Bob Coecke, Lecture Notes in Physics<p>I used to do software things, then I did some hardware things, and then I did some mathy/finance things, then I did some enterprise things, now I do a bit of some. I like to be the dumbest person in the room, because osmosis is a particularly effective way to learn. Losing at chess is fun but only if I can retrospectively analyze why I lost. I enjoy quotes like &quot;God made the integers, all the rest is the work of Man&quot; and IAS lectures.<p>personal email: andrew.nambudripad@gmail.com<p>I leave this as a resource for any undergraduates interested in the forefront of higher mathematics and theoretical computer science, watch this IAS talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O45LaFsaqMA then visit this page: http://uf-ias-2012.wikispaces.com/Open+Problems<p>This is the forefront of a unified approach- aggregating type theory, certain varieties of number theory, has grand implications on all varieties of set theory, and for you logicians out there, entirely operates under the premise that Godel&#x27;s 2nd incompleteness theorem is correct - i.e., first-order arithmetics is inconsistent. More importantly, you can still do important work in spite (or perhaps, because) of this limitation. CMU is doing amazing static analysis work, certainly, but despite its low rank, Princeton has tons to offer.<p>If you&#x27;re still an undergraduate considering graduate school, focus as much as you can on the algebraic (less so analytic) track of mathematics in addition to the standard CS courses everyone takes. Algebraic topology has a way of finding itself into type theory, and having a core knowledge will only enrich your ability to attack those problems from an unconventional approach.",1244181583,1452793560

In the context of abstract environments this means dealing with constraint optimization and reinforcement learning. In partially observable environments means using perceptual learning techniques to make sense of the environment.<p>In order to create an intelligent agent I have constructed a two part system consisting of a system for dealing with optimization under complete information using techniques from order theory, operations research, and optimization theory as well as a system for optimization under incomplete information that uses the perceptual learning capabilities of OpenCV.

He also has discovered that nature's processes can explain the processes of life and the process to succeed at your goals. He is working on book dealing with storms of life.  <p>Now on the profession side of things, I am a Commodity Research and Fund Administrative Associate for JKV Global Enterprises a Institutional Commodities Brokerage firm. My responsibilities include developing relationships with pension funds, hedge funds and high net worth individuals as a teammate with the Vice President of Business Development. In addition, I provide geo-political analysis of global events in relation to the markets, and investigate asset managers on the behalf of pension- institutional investors for potential allocations. During my tenure the firms investable capital increased by over 40%. I developed business development skills from this position that compliment the skills gained from work in the community development world.<p>From my experience within the community development world, I have come to the belief that the community partnerships are at heart of any successful community development plan. My belief developed from experience as a member of ACCION Chicagos turnaround team, I have had the privilege and the honor to play a key role in the survival of many Chicagoland community based companies despite the recent downturns in the economy. This experience came though two- terms as a AmeriCorps<i>VISTA volunteer at ACCION Chicago, which is Non- profit Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) that fosters the growth of small enterprises through investing and developing community partnerships.<p>During my first term at ACCION, I was the Social Investment Coordinator with the objective of developing and executing strategic plans to develop community relations with healthcare providers, for- and non- profit community development organizations. In addition to developing a fundraising plan to obtain new investments, raising $1.1 Million in 2002-03 in the form of Grants and other types of structured financial instruments wide- range of donors. During this experience, my work consisted of presenting complex information to a wide- range of audiences with varying backgrounds, which ranged from elementary school students to community development professionals to financial services regulators.<p>After being in the position for ten months my responsibilities evolved into a business development and public relations role called the Assistant to the Executive Officers. While in this position, I spent a majority of my time redefining the image of ACCION Chicago and forming relationships with organizations that are complimentary. This included developing a marketing campaign during the organizations turnaround period focused on promoting ACCION as co-partners in future Fortune 500 companies. This strategy included fostering relationships with various groups that included banks, insurance companies, foundations, Small Business Administration, CDFI Fund, and community stakeholders. During 2004, the plan raised $2.6 million in capital. In addition, I underwrote commercial loans, developed a system of reporting to investors, analyzed distressed and charged-off portfolio investments, and revised the underwriting policy.<p>My educational background consists of a BS in Industrial Technology- Manufacturing Safety Engineering from Southern Illinois University- Carbondale in combination with a MS in Service Management and a MBA in Financial Analysis and Investments from St. Xavier University- Chicago.",1174662642,1174662642

shainlouis,0,1,0.0,0,1,"I am President of ELOVE, a national matchmaking business which Ive developed over the past 30 years. ELOVE provides personal services to singles through a network of 50 locations in the US and Canada. Louis Shain approached me 7 years ago with a marketing idea, which as it turned out, doubled my revenue within 1 year. No marketing initiative before or since has had such an immediate and lasting impact. Needless to say Louis impressed me.\nBradford W. Megahan, President, Elove.com<p>I enjoyed our conversation last week.  At your earliest convenience, wed love for you to be our guest in Atlanta to see how me make things happen. You clearly have demonstrated a marketing acumen that is quite impressive.  The results youve been getting are remarkable.  We appreciate the opportunities you have provided us.  I know collaborating in person on future business will benefit both companies.  With our breadth of resource, experience and direct marketing know how combined with your expertise and relationships, we can make clients a lot of money.  I look forward to connecting next week.\nNeil Doherty, General Manager, GetMembers.com<p>I have had the pleasure of working with Louis Shain for many years now and am always impressed with his professionalism, integrity, and loyalty.  He is a self-starter with amazing ideas, intense motivation, and an army of followers who believe in him.  He has been the mastermind behind many successful marketing strategies for eleven of my companies and I will always trust his advice and expertise as I have consistently seen the financial rewards.  He outperforms and out-thinks any marketing professional in any field and to work with him in any capacity is an honor.\nToros Yetenekian, CEO, Jumpstart Management",1351139328,1452907339

The platform gives students and anyone with a passion for learning the ability to study at a faster pace,and remember what they learn for much longer. Sharplet courses are organized as â€˜factsâ€™ presented in flashcard format. A spaced repetition algorithm optimally schedules fact review times in response to how well users recall each fact. As users progress through the course, facts that are well known appear less frequently than less well known facts. Learning via the spaced repetition method is one of the fastest ways to transition knowledge into long-term memory. With the time users save it is possible to learn even more new information.",1405416005,1452927535

Following the paradigm of skilled trades, I believe that building a successful dev team comes from passion, hard work and deep interpersonal relationships with peers. I pursue a freedom and flexibility of business, time, and location. I sometimes consult choice clients to help them build their MVP, next iteration, or even stand-in as a part of their team.

This is what I do &quot;for work&quot; and I love it! I am a total geek all around, striving to push the threshold on technology. I am very passionate about gamification, security, big data, and speed. Since starting with assembly and C++ as a teenager and later getting into web applications and mobile, I have come to realize that there is not often one perfect language, framework or tool for the job; which requires me to be well versed in many disciplines.<p>Specialties: consulting, gamification, social networks, mobile, web\nCurrent Interests: go, swift, ruby, python, neo4j, mongo, postgres, reddis, nginx<p>THE SKATER\nI absolutely love board sports! In college I was making custom artwork on blank skateboard decks and selling them to my friends. Fast forward to today and I am now investing in and consulting board sport businesses that have the same mindset and passion as I do: work hard and play harder!<p>Specialties: skateboards, press operations, cnc, design, artwork\nCurrent Interests: surfing, custom longboards",1274819428,1453167558

For a variety of reasons, I have put that on the shelf, and as my savings is nearly gone, I have been pursuing freelance work to try to stay afloat while I figure things out.<p>If you are looking for a freelancer, I would very much appreciate an opportunity to help. The majority of my experience is C#, Java, Clojure, JavaScript, and VBScript, though my experience is fairly broad, and I can get up to speed on anything pretty quickly.<p>email: throwaway@skoogi.com",1339610307,1452903491

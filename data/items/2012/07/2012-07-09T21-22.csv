But, from what I know, enterprise isn't a market that the best product always wins.  Yes, Github definitely has one of the best products out there.  But, they definitely don't have the required experience to push their enterprise product to the market(look at the developers heavy team).  The VC will definitely help in this case.<p>Now, look at another similar product in the market, Atlassion, which raised about 60 millions almost two years ago from Accel.  That was also after years of bootstrapping from Atlassian itself.  2 years ago, the funding market was definitely not as good as the funding market today.

It's easier for me to listen to other people's success stories than to write my own.  I am concerned that I spend too much time learning how to be successful and not enough time actually working on being successful.  Rarely at this point do I feel that the barrier is because there is some <i>knowledge</i> that I did not <i>know</i>, but rather because of failure to ship.  It's possible that my perception is wrong, but obviously I do not think so, or else I would change my perception.<p>If I was able to contain it to one hour a week, it would be fine.  But the problem is finding that one interview that is most optimal this week.  He turns out too many high-quality interviews even to evaluate.<p>It's hard for me to evaluate objectively what is the right balance between genuinely helpful consumption and genuinely valuable production.  I seem to oscillate quite a bit from week to week, and so I wonder to what extent my opinion is reactionary.  But my thinking lately is that I do not make effective use of the resources I have available to me.  Improving the quality of the signal is only good if it makes a net improvement at some point, it is no good if the signal runs straight into earth ground.  I am not saying that consumption is non-useful at all, we are at different stages, etc.  I am just wondering if I have personally been overestimating the utility of consumption to the detriment of production.<p>I also do not have a commute, so I do not have the ""how do I make use of this dead time?"" question that swombat seems to have.

4220738,comment,4217898,4220023,1,0,exDM69,,,"> What makes you think that code compiled through C suddenly loses the need for GC?<p>Yes, you might need to free some heap memory with C and having malloc/free cause GC-like performance. That's why I have zero mallocs in the fast path. The bad part in GC is the unpredictability, which makes it unsuitable for games, simulation and multimedia stuff. But for most allocs I can get away with using the stack, which is essentially free (a possibility of a page fault exists).<p>> Also, I wrote code like yours (hand-written x86-64 SIMD assembly). I then used it from Clojure through JNA and was quite happy with the results.<p>Yes that works quite well as long as the foreign function is big enough.<p>What I have is a bunch of code written with C intrinsics, mostly small functions which I use a handful of for a big bunch of data. What I want is that inner loop to be efficient yet readable.<p>With C and intrinsics I get interprocedural optimization between the small functions. Everything gets inlined and all the values are stored in registers. There are a few hundred SSE math instructions without a single memory operation in between. I get the compiler to do register allocation for instruction scheduling for me, which it is great at (and I suck in) and leaves me with the instruction selection which it is not so great at.<p>Now had this been written with any higher level language, or even C across translation units (without link time optimization), my resulting code would be a lot worse. In particular, live values get spilled out of registers to memory when theres a foreign function call (as per abi requirements).<p>The non-fast path of my project could very well be written in any language as long as the beef would be written in C or similar. I would have to avoid allocating new heap objects to avoid GC unpredicatbility.",1341870604

Open-Source development framework<p>2. Lets you bring Non-Plivo carriers<p>I do have a couple observations, specifically adding the $.004 tariff onto carrier calls kills any real option for external carriers. For those of you who aren't in the Telecom game, a 4 tenths of a penny addition on every minute can make an arbitrage business model much more difficult.<p>Second, Plivo is not very open about the tools that they use to get where they are. This is built on FreeSWITCH, they are doing a basic implementation of this Open-Source software as the media server. This is also the underlying stuff powering UberConference so it's good stuff, but it's important to mention the giants upon whose shoulders you stand.<p>Lastly, on-net calls should be free. As of right now they're $.004 per min for full IP routing. That's bogus in my opinion.<p>Oh and by the way, everything you can do on Plivo can be run on 2600hz and our architecture is fully scalable with over 50 APIs for all of the Telecom functionality you'd ever want.

4220695,comment,4214403,4220281,1,0,btilly,,,"I have been through constructions of the reals, and the proofs for the hyperreals.  It has been years, but I am confident that without much difficulty I could probably give you every proof that is necessary from scratch.<p>The proofs for the hyperreals involve a lot more machinery than the proofs for the standard reals.  That is my educated opinion based on knowing both sets of proofs and constructions.  (Of course this need not make infinitesmals a pedagogical disaster - very few students actually care much about learning the proofs.)<p>As for the model theory approach, I am intimately familiar with the ultrafilter construction.  It uses choice.  I know there is a second construction which I am not familiar with, but from what I've read it also requires choice.  Both involve model theory.  That's a mighty big sledgehammer for a pretty small fly.<p>Incidentally Dedekind cuts can be understood as follows.  The set of reals can be equated with the set of points where you can cut the rationals into two.  More precisely if X is a nonempty subset of the rationals with an upper bound, we get a cut of the rationals into the set of upper bounds of X, and things that are not an upper bound of X.  Any two subsets can be considered equivalent if their set of upper bounds is identical.  An equivalence class of subsets is a real number.<p>For any cut you can generate a unique set A of rationals that are not upper bounds, and a set B of rationals that are upper bounds.  When you do this, all rationals in A are less than all rationals in B, and A does not contain an upper bound.<p>Conversely if we have a partition of the rationals into 2 non-empty sets A and B such that all members of A are less than all members of B, and A does not contain an upper bound.  Then we have a cut of the rationals.<p>So there is a 1-1 correspondence of reals to places we can cut the rationals to partitions of rationals with that property.<p>Those partitions of the rationals are called <i>Dedekind cuts</i>.<p>(This is one of two constructions of the real numbers.  The other, Cauchy sequences, turns out to generalize more usefully in the field of topology.)",1341870138

While seeing how to optimize most things is great, don't do it.

It's really shined with the guest selection/invitation process.<p>We created a couple of lists to group and sort guests into Definite, Good to Have, and Maybe lists and used labels to relations to whoever wanted them, which really helped with the friends and extended family that the other didn't know. We used checkboxes to track addresses that we were waiting on, who's save-the-dates have gone out, etc. I've used the API to total up people for the headcount (since cards we often for ""Jack & Jill Smith""). If we were doing assigned seating, we'd probably make lists for each table and move the cards around. Thankfully, we decided to go for heavy hors d'oeuvres.<p>The thing's versatile: very few things feel like they're driven by the project planning domain (e.g. voting for cards).

I remember talking to an old geologist/oil man about twenty years ago as he went about locating candidate areas to explore based on these fluctuations.  He explained that they'd use magnetometers to map out underground ""cracks"", deposits and other features.  To go from that from generating local location data by overlaying a map of some sort (whether it is a building or something else) is nothing less than trivial.<p>If you have any experience sailing you may have also witnessed the effect of large sunken metallic objects on the compass.

Instead of all computing being embodied in a PC, the PC/workstation just becomes one of many input form factors.

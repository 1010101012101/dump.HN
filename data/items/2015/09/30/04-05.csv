They seem to have a pretty long hike to get to school, and are apparently the only people walking around their neighborhood.<p>It’s little wonder that most people won’t let their kids walk to school anymore in this kind of poorly designed neighborhood. Suburbia of this type is an awful place to be a child, or anyone else without the ability to drive.<p>Imagine how much nicer it would be if the streets were mostly 1–2 driving lanes wide with fewer parking lanes, if the town had more public green space, if most of the adults could commute to work via walking/bicycle/public transit too, and if the kids’ walking route could be shortened by making sure schools are distributed near residential areas, or at least on the same side of the freeway.",1443589142

It&#x27;s a great example of &quot;devil in the details&quot; kind of thing.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say you define a type of list of size n. Great. You can only assign list of the same size and you can only append an element of the type &quot;n&quot; to a type &quot;n-1&quot; or the compiler will complain. Now you can even prove that your program is formally correct. What&#x27;s not to like?<p>And then, reality knocks at your door.<p>How do you instantiate such a type? It needs to be instantiated right away with n elements or your program won&#x27;t compile. But these elements are coming from the runtime, say, a database. How the hell does this work?<p>Dependently typed languages that go just a step beyond prototypes quickly realize how crippling this approach is and they will give you all kinds of escape hatches to weaken the type system just so you can use the darn thing. But it&#x27;s futile, because at the end of the day, a program is a living thing that relies on side effects and external inputs, and sophisticated systems are just not designed to cope with human fuzziness.<p>The reason why dependently typed systems never became popular is not because the world hasn&#x27;t realized yet how awesome they are: it&#x27;s because they just aren&#x27;t a good fit to solve real problems.",1443586057

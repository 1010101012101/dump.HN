Instead we often use technology for signaling, and the truth remains that the Microsoft stack (even if you talk up open source equivalents like mono) is an anti-quality signal. This is not judgmental (I have used and abused the MS stack for years), but is observational. And that tendency is often based upon experience -- the bulk of .NET programmers are enterprise inhouse developers usually building dated, poor quality solutions.<p>This hits hiring as well. Someone mentioned the quantity of .NET programmers, and while this is true the quality is extremely, extremely poor on average. Having had to hire .NET programmers, the best success we have had, result wise, is to hire !.NET programmers (e.g. the hiring process started being about abstract problems that could be solved with anything, etc) and let them loose with C#/etc. If we limited ourselves to the .NET skillset we got tonnes of applications, almost all of which were terrible.",1407682709

8159866,comment,8157840,8159364,3,0,chiph,,,"Temperature certainly has an effect on batteries¹. But also that the periods of high current demand were spaced so far apart -- the batteries had time to recover.  Much like how the battery in your car is a &quot;starting&quot; battery -- high current is needed only occasionally to start the engine, with the alternator making up the demand the rest of the time.<p>¹ Dad used to work for Union Carbide, which owned the &quot;Eveready&quot; brand at the time. One of the projects he worked on was a battery for the Union Pacific Railroad. It was designed to be buried in the ground in remote locations to run signal systems.  Burying it gave it a more constant temperature.  If the researchers placed the battery on the inside of the collar next to the wolf&#x27;s fur, that could really extend it&#x27;s life.",1407682568

Besides, it&#x27;s been airing this blow-by-blow for months now, long before that ad buy.<p>To the extent the NYT is inclined to take Hachette&#x27;s side of the fight, that&#x27;s largely because its staff and editors are much closer to Hachette, geographically, professionally, and socially.

8159863,comment,8159640,8159640,2,0,BerislavLopac,,,"The main problem with all arguments for keeping the prices of books (and other information sources, for that matter) high is that they are bullshit. If we look at the history, the price of books were never depending on their _contents_; instead, it were always determined by their _production_. Hardcover books, on high quality paper and with colour illustrations, always were priced higher than low-quality prints with b/w images (or without any) -- and the price was never significantly affected by the popularity, a paperback copy of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; or &quot;50 Shades of Gray&quot; costs essentially the same as a unknown author&#x27;s book. And the price of books was always affected only by technology improvements -- Guttenberg&#x27;s press, linotype, print-on-demand etc -- and not by anything the authors wrote about.<p>With digital revolution, the book production costs drop essentially to zero. Also, most of the elements that used to be necessary to bring a book from an author to their readers -- agents, typesetters, printers, bookshops and especially publishers -- are becoming redundant; authors can easily market themselves to a worldwide audience, distributing e-books directly to the readers and even directly accepting payments. The only thing preventing this is the publishers who push against it and try to keep as much of the status quo as possible, as Hachette is doing now.<p>That being said, Amazon is not without their own part of the guilt, as they&#x27;re trying to become the central place for locating and distributing books, and so far they&#x27;re succeeding; but that is a whole different issue.",1407682526

That&#x27;s why every deal Google has tried to make with auto-makers has fell through.  Google wants to rush to the finish line and create a fully self-driving car.  But the time-frame to be able to deliver that is fairly unknown due to a number of issues.<p>Auto-makers want to do smaller R&D projects that they can deliver to consumers within a few years of start (instead of a decade+).  Things like adaptive cruise control or self-braking.  These are things that were just a few years of R&D and are shipping now.<p>They are different paths to the same goal.  We don&#x27;t know the outcome yet, Google or the auto-makers may get there first.  But we do know that auto-makers will have sellable features in the mean time while Google just has pretty marketing videos and demos.<p>What Google is bringing (that the article mentions) is the discussion about fully self-driving cars.  This discussions means laws are being passed to facilitate the technology.  It also means that the NTSB, insurance companies, and others involved in the auto industry are talking about the impacts of what a self-driving car means within our current system.  So hopefully by the time they arrive, the rules and laws will be caught up with it.  It also means consumers are talking about it and becoming aware of the possibility, which helps motivate others to work on the same projects.  It may also mean that consumers are less wary of the technology when it actually does arrive.",1407682320

Tesla has pushed the big car companies to do what they could have done decades ago - build and distribute fully electric cars that are the same or better quality than non-electric cars. And, your questionable view that profitability for a company in it&#x27;s growth phase defines success non-withstanding, they&#x27;re pretty quickly eating their lunch at it too. They&#x27;re going to continue to be forced to compete with Tesla because Tesla builds amazing cars that people want to buy. When they&#x27;re able to sell them more places and build them at new price points (already happening), it&#x27;s going to be fun to watch.<p>However, that doesn&#x27;t mean the big car companies won&#x27;t make cars that are just as good - the point is that now they HAVE to and that&#x27;s good.

8159852,comment,8156783,8158793,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"The First Barbary War is a fascinating subject, and it&#x27;s interesting as a point of reference. Not that I&#x27;m necessarily advocating the bribe or tribute system, per se; I&#x27;m just thinking about it as an intellectual exercise. But in theory, a key difference between the US today and the US in the 1790s is that we <i>have</i> the world&#x27;s most impressive and dominant navy, and if push came to shove, we could retaliate pretty aggressively. So our bribe would be backed by a credible threat: take this payment, but don&#x27;t bite the hand that feeds you.<p>Now, as I mentioned, this creates all sorts of perverse economic incentives. First, it encourages infighting among the warlords, further destabilizing the region as each band or group jockeys for top position. Second, it could just as easily be taken by the pirates as a sign of weakness. They&#x27;ll want to test the limits of that weakness, either by raising their prices over time, by taking more ships for ransom. Finally, it legitimizes some no doubt unsavory leaders, whose American ties would cause deeper sociopolitical problems for us when they got out.",1407682165

I&#x27;ve used Flask for a few small things before, but this time I&#x27;m trying to do better by:<p>- Instead of having everything in a single .py file, using Python packages and Flask blueprints to make the code more modular.<p>- Having a way to distinguish between different users<p>- Tests (I haven&#x27;t written any tests yet)<p>I&#x27;m using Flask because I find Python comfortable, and I was scared off by the amount of convention I encountered when I researched Rails and Django.

8159845,comment,8155431,8159468,2,0,metacorrector,,,"First, to give you the answer, in your position you need to exchange your knight for his, and after he takes back with his queen, attack his queen with your bishop, which seems to offers your bishop as a sacrifice, but it&#x27;s poison for him.<p>I agree with you. I don&#x27;t want to take anything away from the terrific amount of work that went into this, it&#x27;s a great achievement... but it needs to have a richer set of choices for the learner, and it would be nice if it could explain more exactly what was wrong with each of your erroneous choices, and perhaps provide a more directed set of hints that laid out what you should be looking at by explaining weaknesses in the position or &quot;obvious&quot; signs of opportunity, rather than demanding a very specific single course of action. Why all the alternative moves are weaker is as useful as why the good moves work. What might work is if the site had a &quot;wiki&quot; style of notation adding, so a richer database of explanations could be crowdsourced.<p>Back to the problem, if it&#x27;s of any help to you, I came up with the answer by noting that I need to move my knight out of the way to get my black bishop active and onto those juicy squares defended by my pawns, and to get my white bishop out of the way to open the file for my linked up queen and rook, and also that his queen is threatening my undefended pawn so I looked to get my bishop onto that diagonal as a defender.<p>This position is a good example of a number of core concepts, for example that the bishops because they are on diagonals coordinate a little better with the other pieces when they are on the flanks of the attack rather than in the middle where they can clog, and that the rooks and queen benefit from open files, and that knights are useful when the position is somewhat clogged but frequently they should be exchanged for a more advantageous opening of the position. But the pedagogy here does not teach that.<p>I am a decent (but very rusty) chess player, but what I am good at is a little more &quot;holistic&quot;, I play by developing my position in more or less sensible ways and then exploiting opportunities when they arise; but a lot of that is somewhat unconcious thought learned from a great deal of play, and &quot;understanding&quot; my position for me comes from being the one who developed it. In contrast, it is hard for me to jump in and look at a developed position and find the magic in it which is what this style of teaching requires. Probably a good set of things for me to work on, but at the same time the chess rating it gives me is absurd because I play at a much higher level than 1200 but I have tremendous difficulty getting my score to climb. I mention this because even though you and I come at this from different places, my complaint about the site is the same as yours: it&#x27;s demanding a very specific set of moves and it&#x27;s not really explaining or guiding as much as it needs to. Sometimes I pick the right move and it says &quot;congrats! let&#x27;s move on&quot; and I&#x27;m thinking I have no idea what was so great about what I chose, the move seemed sensible but not stunning.<p>Now, I may be not the typical user (as an experienced, highly intuitive player with voids where big chunks of my skills are lacking, so the system should not be redesigned for me) but I mention it because while I can rely on some of my developed talents to solve these problems, I don&#x27;t feel that this would teach those talents that I do have, and they would be very useful for learners to develop.",1407682028

In debugging hard problems this is often NOT the case.<p>For example, if you put 100 teams to find a particular issue that is causing crashes in the field you suddenly have your field team getting requests at random times asking similar questions, although each may have a distinct twist.  At some point in time a percentage of the team suspects the networking stack -- the networking team starts getting questions staggered over time.  Their time now gets spent looking at this.  And then if you have to run some type of stress or in a specific customer environment -- that gets sequentialized, unless you buy new hardware.<p>And lets say all 100 teams find a fix, but they are all in different places in code.

For instance, if you throw $n$ developers with equal knowledge of a codebase independently at a problem whose time-to-solve is exponentially distributed with rate $\\lambda$, then they&#x27;ll solve it at a rate of $n \\lambda$. Of course, this is almost always less efficient than letting them work on their own problems!<p>However, if you apply a similar analogy to <i>reliability</i> instead of time, having people work on the same task with what would appear at first to be redundant effort can increase reliability phenomenally. In a way, we see this in organizations that demarcate developers and test engineers - you&#x27;re throwing bodies at a problem, creating a rivalry of two groups that challenge each other by attacking a problem from different angles, and in doing so you have a different distribution over the error/bug rate than you would otherwise.<p>An interesting read on this point is <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff</a> about the team that does (did :( ) software engineering for the space shuttle.

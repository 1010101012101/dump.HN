1543366,story,,,32,24,fxj,"Ask HN: Why isn't Javascript the new BASIC?",,"There was a time (ca. 1985) where almost every computer showed a BASIC prompt after switching it on and everybody could just start programming. Many nowadays top programmers found their love for coding by using this (arcane) programming language. Why is this not happening any more? Of course we don't have BASIC on our PCs and Macs and ipads any more, but we have something better: JavaScript.<p>Why, for heavens sake, has nobody written a decent self-contained JavaScript IDE that we all can use right away?<p>Write a HTML5 application that serves as an IDE with all the bells and whistles that JavaScript supports today. jQuery could be part of it. A GUI Editor could be part of it.  The whole app could be self-modifiable. And you could store it in a zipped bookmarklet. Services like www.laterloop.com show how to do that. 
You could distribute the little programs on your website without need for apples app shop. Hell, we could make our own app show and apple could not do anything against it. The apps would run on all platforms that support JavaScript and a decent  subset of HTML5.<p>So where are the top JavaScript programmers that make this a reality? The next generation of young hackers is waiting desperately for it (even they don't know that they do).",1279961785

1543348,comment,1542487,1542641,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"""Interesting"" is not the same as ""gratifying one's intellectual curiosity.""  More specifically, and again quoting the guidelines about on-topic:<p><pre><code>    Anything that good hackers would find interesting.
    That includes more than hacking and startups.  If
    you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might
    be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual
    curiosity.
</code></pre>
The audience is clearly intended to be hackers.  It could be argued - and I believe and use as my guidance - that this particular paragraph is referring to things that satisfy the intellectual curiosity <i>of hackers</i> more than it would of non-hackers.  In other words, the articles should not only be interesting, but they should be such that non-hackers would not find them as interesting.<p>On the margins there will always be articles that don't get killed which perhaps should, and articles which should probably survive, but don't.  There will be random fluctuations akin to turbulence around the edges.<p>The Economist article about prisoners ( <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1541942"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1541942</a> ) might be regarded as something biased in interest towards hackers because people can argue about how to change the laws, or the meting out of punishments - hacking justice.  The NY Times article about Jewish conversion is perhaps less biased to hackers because there's nothing for hackers specifically to argue. It's of broad interest to intelligent and politically aware people, and not specifically biased towards hackers.<p>Personally I'd wish for more clarity on exactly what happens, because then there'd be fewer people speculating and asking the same questions over and over.  Also personally, I'd wish for more deeply technical submissions.<p>But here is a certainty: navel gazing, questions about policy, complaints about submissions being killed, and general moaning about karma, flags and moderators are getting killed faster than I've seen since I arrived. Not everyone shares your exact interests, and if your submission gets killed, move on.",1279961049

1543344,comment,1542858,1542893,0,0,rb2k_,,,"riak does support automatic sharding and enables you to tune your CAP paramters. Getting nodes in and out of a cluster is way easier with riak.
While riak does also support map/reduce, generating something like a couchdb's ""views"" will probably end up being a problem since listing all the keys of large buckets (needed for a view of all your data) is a really expensive operation in riak. Also: couchdb supports incremental views, so if the view is fixed, you'll only need to update the changed documents.  
My main problem with couchDB was that in systems with a lot of changing data, the compaction was too slow for me. I actually changed data faster than the compaction could work on. Also: you have to compact that stuff yourself by sending an explicit http request.",1279960517

1543333,comment,1542047,1542139,0,0,photon_off,,,"I've found it's one thing to make a ToDo list, but completely another thing to complete the items on it.  What I've found is that there are actually (at least) two major things that get in the way of finishing up projects.  The first is knowing what you need to do, which a todo list solves.  But, all too often I used to stare blankly at the ""todo"" list, and while it was comforting to know what needed to be done (and actually quite fun to come up with these things), I'd still have the overarching feeling that ""it's really going to suck doing these things, and I really don't want to do them.""<p>The way I get over this second hump, the way I actually get myself to do things that I know need to be done, is pretty simple.  I sit down and imagine how it's going to feel when I finish doing these easy tasks, and how I'm going to feel when I've conquered this list, and seen my idea through all the way.  I know it's going to feel great to finish the things, so why not just do them already?  The more I think about it, the more I get excited to go to work.<p>If your goal of completing your todo list is ""I get to feel what it's like to conquer these things, to completely realize this idea or project of mine from beginning to end"" as opposed to ""I just need to do this drudgery,"" then you might find yourself being propelled by your own desire to <i>feel good</i>, and you might even have fun doing it.",1279959798

But even the usage of transparencies was too much for this professor. All of his 'slides' were just transparencies which he had used a wet-erase marker to write dense paragraphs of text, which was mostly what he was reading back to us. Not only was this worse than most usage of PowerPoint that people complain about, he didn't even take the time to maybe type up these 'slides' and print them on transparencies (or go to a local office supply store / print shop to get it done).<p>Point being some people will use the tools presented to them (even very basic tools) in the most bone-headed way possible. It's just a fact of life.",1370419170

Because at one point in the chain someone will have to turn the bitcoin into USD. The ""anonymity"" argument is useless because you'll get linked at the ""get dollars"" phase.<p>Obviously the idea is that if everyone uses bitcoins then nobody will use dollars, but in that case the gov't just decides to declare bitcoins currency, and tax things as usual.<p>In a universe where everyone is using bitcoin, the global economy will be pretty fucked though, considering that everybody would be in a de facto liquidity trap (since inflation would no longer exist).

And with the speeds and energies with which grid storage flywheels operate, that's a significant engineering concern.<p>You can align the angle of the flywheel to match the angle of the earth at your latitude, which helps with that. However if you do that the flywheel is titled, so the bearings are uneven, and then you need some shielding above the flywheel - you can't just have the earth be the walls.<p>But it means that the bearings experience much less force, so it can be worth it.",1370418843

Superficially it would seem that they are very similar, with OT perhaps being a way to combine the events before applying them to the state.<p>The reason I ask is that I'm thinking of the feasibility of modelling a disconnected client that continues working from some state.

These session descriptions need be tweaked according to who is connecting and what parameters, so it also doesn't allow for a node to forward another nodes details (to form an overlay).<p>I've been researching the process of building a true P2P application on top of web technologies, but sadly and frustratingly this is stumping my progress. The only solution would be to expose a more 'raw' connection API by creating an RTCSessionDescription based on IP addresses. It's possible to hack together a solution whereby you tweak the data in the SDP blob (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Description_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Description_Protocol</a>), but this is too cumbersome.",1370418805

It was a well priced book. I think she had reduced the middleman's[0] commission to a great extent.<p>Funny thing about that book, you can buy it legitimately at ~90 and even street vendors(pirated copy sellers) usually sell it at 50+ and people still buy :-)\nI think they never got that taste of that feeling when you read a book, hold it your hand, travel with it and then over the time appreciate the crease on it and dream passing it over to your bloodline hoping they would love reading books.<p>Anyway, I still feel bad having to pirate any book or film or songs. Very bad. Though my next statement is technically incorrect but there are times I can't avoid pirating a book.<p>I have reduced my music piracy. I've reduced/ the number of songs I listen to around ~ 7GB (almost all of them 320kbps or 8-20 MB on an average). Out of them around 4GB I've purchased and to be honest a lot of them is from Flipkart's 10 day freebie bonanza, but I've purchased from other sources a lot and I must say that A 7-9 Rupee DRM free song is a deal sweeter than saccharine so I like a song and I buy it. I can even go a lot more if the cost goes directly to the artist or most and I do it. Like Indian Ocean's music. I hope in a few months I'll not have any pirated song on my pc or phone. I use Spotify so that also covers a lot.<p>I've not have any good and affordable[1] alternative for fils. I hope sth like Netflix/Hulu comes up in India or even a good DVD/BRay rental online shop which offers quality with a price. The ones we have don't have many worthwhile films int heir inventory.<p>Yes, you are right - pricing does affect privacy, in a positive way to check it. However there are people who would just pirate! Piracy is imprinted on their minds and they never bothered to check whether it's a necessity and or is there a mid-way like a friend who stopped using WhatsApp the day his 1 yr trial was over, he just had to pay INR 55 for another year.

Even if you do great it could be better with just a little practice.<p>1. Basics: go over the benefits for them. Benefits... not features. They'll ask about features they need after you're done so focus on what your software can do for them, how it will help their business, etc.<p>2. No one is going to be able to answer this without a hell of a lot more details on your product. Best bet is to look into competitors and price around there. These are your first customers and this price isn't permanent (maybe for them but you can raise the price on anyone after) so don't worry about it too much.<p>3. The biggest thing is actually selling yourself. Your software is not perfect right now. It's not going to have all the features they want. So, with that in mind, you need to be confident enough about both your product and your personal ability to improve it to sell these guys on the FACT that you're going to solve their problems. Period.<p>4. a. I'd like to emphasize again that you should give this presentation as many times as you possibly can to people who ""don't matter"" before doing this first time pitch. \n   b. Relax. It's difficult to ignore how awesome it would be if you landed these guys but just keep it in the back of your head that you'll still be in a great place even if they pass. Managing your expectations this way will go a long way to help you keeping even keel, both in general and specifically in the presentation itself.<p>I'm sure plenty of people here can give you better input with more detail but if you'd like feel free to email me (info in profile) with more questions and/or more info on your product.<p>Good luck!",1370416280

If you're renting you have more freedom to move, and increased mobility leads to less unemployment. This is the most obvious reason, but not the only one.<p>2) If mortgages take away a big enough portion of the paycheck, consumers have on average less money to spend in another things, and lack of demand can cripple the economy, while banks leech all the money (""extractive elites""). If rent was more prevalent, it would be easier to move to a more affordable house from time to time, driving down home prices (it would be kind of a ""less captive"" market; I'm not sure if that makes as much sense as I think).<p>3) The prevalence of mortgages gives employers a lot of leverage. If you're in serious debt, you're more likely to accept worse condition on your current job, because you can't afford to miss a payment (miss enough payments and you <i>lose your house but keep your debt</i>). Maybe it's a cultural thing, but this is a very real thing here in Spain. The effect is that employers can force worse conditions (especially lower salaries) on employees, which, again, creates a lack of demand because people don't have money to spend. Even worse, once you hit certain level of unemployment (which nevertheless was very high in Spain to begin with), it affects you even if you don't have a mortgage, because there is a huge amount of people willing to work for peanuts, driving salaries down for everyone and creating a feedback that reinforces the whole process.",1370415972

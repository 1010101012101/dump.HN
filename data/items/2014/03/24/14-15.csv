7458560,comment,7456237,7457298,2,0,jccc,,,"<i>“It’s an awful thing, solitary,” John McCain wrote of his five and a half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam—more than two years of it spent in isolation in a fifteen-by-fifteen-foot cell, unable to communicate with other P.O.W.s except by tap code, secreted notes, or by speaking into an enamel cup pressed against the wall. “It crushes your spirit and weakens your resistance more effectively than any other form of mistreatment.” And this comes from a man who was beaten regularly; denied adequate medical treatment for two broken arms, a broken leg, and chronic dysentery; and tortured to the point of having an arm broken again.</i><p><i>A U.S. military study of almost a hundred and fifty naval aviators returned from imprisonment in Vietnam, many of whom were treated even worse than McCain, reported that they found social isolation to be as torturous and agonizing as any physical abuse they suffered.</i><p><i>And what happened to them was physical. EEG studies going back to the nineteen-sixties have shown diffuse slowing of brain waves in prisoners after a week or more of solitary confinement. In 1992, fifty-seven prisoners of war, released after an average of six months in detention camps in the former Yugoslavia, were examined using EEG-like tests. The recordings revealed brain abnormalities months afterward; the most severe were found in prisoners who had endured either head trauma sufficient to render them unconscious or, yes, solitary confinement. Without sustained social interaction, the human brain may become as impaired as one that has incurred a traumatic injury.</i><p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/03/30/090330fa_fact_gawande"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/03/30/090330fa_fact_...</a>",1395673174

7458557,comment,7404594,7438169,1,0,fargolime,,,"I realize I&#x27;ve been confusing, for which I apologize. I change my law of physics to: Two free test particles each moving toward destinations beyond opposite sides of a LIF, as measured in a global frame containing the LIF, recede from each other as measured in that LIF. I have always accepted that the particles move in one direction as measured in the LIFs.<p>I&#x27;ve given this a lot of thought to try to see where our major disagreement is. It&#x27;s hard to tell from your walls of text. I now think it&#x27;s this: You disagree that any prediction for a global frame can affect experiments in the LIF. Therefore you ignore such predictions and draw spacetime diagrams as one would in SR. Of course when you do that you find no difference between two LIFs. I say you&#x27;re not seeing the forest for the trees.<p>Forget about black holes and light rays and especially complex GR terminology. Focus on the simpler skydiver&#x27;s frame. Let the analogous prediction for the global frame be this: any particle below 1 km above sea level must fall inexorably toward r = 0. Let your first probe be launched just above the 1 km mark. It doesn&#x27;t need to be escaping, just always moving away from the Earth during our experiment. Let the second probe be launched just below the 1 km mark. As measured in any LIF containing both particles, they&#x27;ll recede from each other. As measured in a global frame, the first probe is moving toward a destination beyond the side of the LIF that&#x27;s facing away from the Earth, while the second probe is moving toward a destination beyond the opposite side of the LIF that&#x27;s facing toward the Earth.<p>For the record I still believe my argument using megaparsec-sized frames was sound. Your counterargument didn&#x27;t explicitly show that any sentence in mine was false or didn&#x27;t follow from its premises. Also I still don&#x27;t know from this discussion how the argument in the blog isn&#x27;t sound.",1395673144

The goal is to provide some measurement that both accurately measures overall contribution to the community and encourages consistent engagement. Several solutions were discussed and a few were even tried. For example, pg tried to replace the overall karma score with an average score. All three combinations (total only, average only, and both) were juggled around in the top right corner, until eventually the simple total was used.<p>While all these attempts were good ideas, I think there is an even better metric that should be used here: the Sharpe ratio.<p>Risk adjusted returns\nWhen you look to invest in an asset, it&#x27;s often important to consider the risk of an investment as well as the overall historical returns. Assuming you have no external knowledge of the asset, looking at the volatility of its returns is a pretty good estimate of risk. Ideally, you&#x27;d like to see super high returns with no volatility– just a steady stream of money rolling in day after day.1",1395670798

But that robs profanity of its usefulness (for example, some recent research shows that swearing can actually alleviate physical pain - but if no words are considered &quot;bad,&quot; this probably wouldn&#x27;t work any more).<p>The whole idea of a swear word is that it&#x27;s supposed to be strong, and, yes, offensive in some way. That means that there will be contexts in which profanity will be inappropriate, and there is nothing prudish about knowing this. Good writing means using the right word for the right purpose, and sprinkling swears inside a technical article <i>usually</i> comes off as cheap and lazy.<p>Your attitude changes when you have children.

7458222,comment,7455757,7457960,2,0,bpyne,,,"Just to add to your point, having a fairly large culture of start up founders in their 20&#x27;s nowadays adds to the problem (1). People gather around them people they can relate to - it&#x27;s sub-conscious. A 20-something and a 40-something have few overlapping cultural references in entertainment, night life, flavor of the day programming languages/frameworks/build systems/etc., and problem domain. I see a number of social media sites/apps whose purpose I don&#x27;t understand. I&#x27;m on FB and have Yelp&#x27;ed a few times but resist even Twitter because I&#x27;m on information overload all the time raising a child. Interviewing at a social media start up would become uncomfortable quickly as I pretend to understand what &quot;itch they&#x27;re trying to scratch&quot;.<p>If more founders were in their 40&#x27;s, would reverse discrimination happen? &quot;So, you lack systems analysis and operations skills and you&#x27;ve only used one flavor of *nix...(phone reminder goes off)...Quite sorry, I have to end this interview early to pick up my daughter from daycare, she&#x27;s vomiting. Oh, you&#x27;ll go early to SXSW...is that a new airline?&quot;<p>Is it illegal for a start up to discriminate against me if I have the technical acumen? Sure. But the hiring person doesn&#x27;t have to consciously discriminate. It can happen just by placing greater emphasis on the lack of experience in a particular framework when the real reason is that the hiring person just didn&#x27;t relate to me as a 46 yo in any way.<p>1. I&#x27;m not implying that it&#x27;s a problem having a large number of 20-something start up founders. People with time and energy to solve cool problems is only a social benefit.<p>(EDIT: Changed asterisk to 1.)",1395669729

The target audience is non-tech people who want to see examples of your work. As a contract developer in NYC, I find that LinkedIn and other convetional means (e.g. resume) don&#x27;t always do a great job of showcasing your abilities to non-tech people.<p>On another note, I am running a meetup at the Hive55 coworking space on April 2nd from 7:00pm to 9:00pm. I will showcase two or three projects selected from this site. If you are in the NYC area and would like to present your project to my meetup group (http://www.meetup.com/Full-Stack-iOS-Development-Group), submit your project to this site and I will contact you directly. I plan on doing these meetups 2x a month or so. Thanks.<p>edit: the search bar doesn&#x27;t work yet.",1395669720

Pretty much the antithesis of everything related to traditional haggling.<p>So, tell me again: who are these children, what do they look like, how old are they? If they&#x27;re old enough to work, why aren&#x27;t they, etc. If they&#x27;re not cute, by <i>my</i> cultural standards which you have only a small chance of guessing, then what&#x27;s up with that?<p>It&#x27;s much easier to either drive a customer away or raise non-germane questions during a depersonalized haggling event. It&#x27;s also way to easy to have those questions begin driving the conversation in the customer&#x27;s mind.<p>Note: I&#x27;m from a culture where haggling over price is not the norm and I&#x27;m not a fan of it.

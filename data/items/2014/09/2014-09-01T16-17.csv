We’re bringing much needed change to local high-volume delivery restaurants that are still doing delivery the way they’ve always done it.  It&#x27;s a very interesting technology and logistics problem, quickly routing orders to optimal drivers in near-real-time.  Our CEO has a substantial amount of experience in the space from his first startup.<p>In addition to Y Combinator, we are backed by some of the premier early stage venture capital funds, including First Round Capital and SV Angel, and awesome angel investors like Eric Ries & Gabriel Weinberg, the founder of DuckDuckGo.  This is your opportunity to get in on the ground-floor. You would be engineer number 3 or 4.  You’ll have a ton of impact – lots of freedom to help us evolve our platform, stack, and apps.  We have strong dev practices, put an emphasis on testing, and deploy rapidly.<p>Our stack: We have an AI backend service that handles order routing, multiple mobile applications – for our drivers and restaurants, and several Ruby on Rails applications for customer-facing/internal services.  We’re using Angular.js and CoffeeScript on the frontend.<p>The roles we’re hiring for:<p><pre><code>  * Artificial Intelligence engineer\n  * Data Science – roles open for data analysis and data infrastructure\n  * Ruby on Rails engineers\n  * Frontend engineer (Angular.js)\n  * Mobile (iOS and Android) engineers\n  * Infrastructure/DevOps engineer\n </code></pre>\nIf this sounds interesting and you&#x27;d like to learn more, send me an email: robert@zoomer.io",1409590781

8253740,comment,8251842,8252177,1,0,jandrewrogers,,,"For practical purposes, the difference between various non-LRU algorithms are workload dependent. They all work better than LRU generally. It is always possible to contrive a pathological access pattern for a given algorithm. These more sophisticated cache replace algorithms attempt to minimize the cross-section of realistic workloads that break the algorithm. 2Q style cache replacement is not the most robust of these but it is simple to implement and understand.<p>One thing to be aware of when selecting these algorithms is that many of them were designed for the assumptions of much older computer systems. For systems with large memory and a low cache miss rate (most modern ones), the CPU cache friendliness of the cache replacement algorithm can have a significant impact on practical performance. This is, for example, one of the advantages of clock-style algorithms.<p>In a lot of good database engines, these basic algorithms are extended so that individual execution contexts can annotate the cache with their opinion on the disposition of the page. One thread may think a page is stone cold, another may think it is hot. All of this metadata is reduced to an adaptive determination of whether or not a page should be evicted at a particular point in time. It is robust and fast across workloads but is relatively complicated to implement and partially exposes the underlying implementation to the rest of the system.",1409590336

Oddly, he found some things got faster in Kotlin for no obvious reason. Some JVM optimisation magic, I guess.<p>Kotlin is a much more pragmatic language than many such new ones. They are building it for use in their own products including performance sensitive products like IntelliJ. For example it has an inline method attribute. This may seem remarkably low level for a modern JVM based language intended for industrial use, but there&#x27;s a point to it: it lets you use lambda functions and misc features that rely on them without extraneous memory allocations. Applied consistently this sort of thing can make the difference between &quot;a lovely language that&#x27;s too expensive to use&quot; and &quot;a lovely language that is deployable&quot;. It&#x27;s not auto-inferred because otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t be able to make libraries that have stable ABIs with Kotlin.<p>Generally they seem to be targeting zero performance degradation over Java even when using the advanced features, which is nice to see.",1409590307

We&#x27;re not even talking about &quot;poor&quot; people here. The people hardest-hit by these policies are first-generation middle class people, who don&#x27;t stand out with a sob story about how they grew up in poverty, but aren&#x27;t in a position where they can do volunteer work and also have their parents buy them a car.

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We are going to Portugal this month! Want to come?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http://we.are.expensify.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).

They are priced at the highest point the market will tolerate.<p>This is a very simplistic view: product pricing also takes into account things like psychological thresholds (e.g. why it&#x27;s 9.99/month rather than 10) and the likelihood of a competitor entering the space if your profit margins are too high. Amazon is famous for keeping low margins because they&#x27;re willing to trade the short-term profits in exchange for making it harder for someone else to enter the space which would hurt their profits long term.<p>> The simple fact of operating from California means they don&#x27;t care about operating costs.<p>Again, simplistic analysis: a business like Dropbox doesn&#x27;t need to scale their employment at the same rate as they add customers so individual costs matter less than, say, a fast-food restaurant because each employee&#x27;s work benefits as many customers as you can convince to signup. If you&#x27;re making a profit on someone&#x27;s labor their salary isn&#x27;t as significant as, say, the opportunity-cost of not being able to hire someone at all or hiring the wrong person because most of the top people have been lured elsewhere.

These words/concepts exist for historical reasons, and not because they represent some sort of cohesive or unified approach to filtering in general.  The exact same problem exists for simulating effects pedals for guitars in programs like Pro Tools, interestingly.<p>Only Fourier methods can possibly unify this type of filtering, for a number of reasons which are actually obvious to anyone who is familiar with the fundamental role played by these methods in analysis.<p>The problem seems to be that the people who actually use this stuff all the time do not know Fourier methods and are not in a position to learn it; and this has created a massive inertia against re-formulating the entire UI/UX for image filtering based on the only possible unified approach.<p>It might be thought that Fourier methods are too hard for a graphic designer to understand, but I believe that it is up to people like us who do understand these things to redo the entire approach to filtering from square one, based on Fourier methods.

In fact, I&#x27;d argue that allowing time for software to mature is a Good Thing -- in the meantime, bugs get fixed, regressions in libraries are reverted, semantic versioning violations are repaired, etc, which reduces the amount of needless headache you have to deal with when you just want to Get Work Done.<p>Of course there are exceptions (I would never ask anyone to write server code under Ruby MRI pre-2.1), but those conditions are readily dealt with: you compile what you need (perhaps statically), put it in a tarball in /opt, make some symlinks to /usr/local (or update your PATH and other environment variables) and move on to the next actual problem.<p>Yes, standards and &quot;old packages&quot; can be annoying if you&#x27;re used to a greater level of control on your personal equipment.

If anything, I&#x27;d say a lot more male founders are rejected vs female. 5.75675675675676x more male founders are rejected compared to female founders. But still there is sexism involved towards the females. Why can&#x27;t we accept that a lot less women are interested in entrepreneurship and technology than men? I do not intend sexism, but a majority of female entrepreneurs I&#x27;ve come across sell nail polish/stickers and necklaces. Not exactly sure why that kind of business requires going through an accelerator.

And, yes, I have read the novel <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> by John Steinbeck, which is required reading in many United States schools.] No, the situations in the two countries were not at all comparable. First of all, there was no widespread famine in the United States. I have close relatives who lived through that era in that place (they never moved from their family farms) and are now more than ninety years old. Second, there was no governmental effort to keep the people who thought they were best off moving from moving. Third, both before and after the interstate moves, most of the people who moved were land-owners. Fourth (maybe this should be first on the list), all of the adults in the United States during the Great Depression, other than most black people in the South, were voters and able to influence the political system. Just outside the region I wrote about first here, the region you mentioned first, were grassroots political movements to represent farmer rights. (Nothing of the kind existed under Stalin&#x27;s dictatorship.) Here in Minnesota, the state branch of the Democratic Party is actually formally named the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, having been formed by a merger (just about exactly seventy years ago) between the state Democratic Party and the Farmer-Labor Party, a third-party movement so powerful that it elected a governor during its heyday.<p>So, no, in the United States we look at the historical experience of Stalinism as a wholly negative example, one of the worst examples of mass irrationality and needless human suffering in the twentieth century. Where the various branches of my family have lived for generations, we know better than to take Stalin&#x27;s policies as models of modernization or anything worthwhile.",1398001703

It is purposeful selective attention to call out the terrible famine in the Ukraine in the 1930. My ancestors died of the same famine in Russia and I know of many Russians who lost members of their family to hunger in 1930s. There was a widespread famine at the time, caused by collectivization and industrialization policies to migrate from inefficient, low capital, individual-based farming practices to highly efficient, large scale, high capital practices. In Soviet Union it was an inhumane, ruthless collectivization. In United States it was a bit more humane, financial capital driven policy of moving individual farmers off their land. In both cases, there was no nationalistic or genocidal component. Attempts to portray the famine as targeted at Ukranians serves no purpose other than to divide Russians and Ukrainians and pit them against each other. Recent events in Ukraine show that this is exactly the policy of the United States.",1398001174

As absurd as it sounds, what went down with TPB shows how laws perspire beyond a country&#x27;s boundaries.<p>As for what actually happened to PT, it isn&#x27;t as clear-cut as it seems.<p>I can tell you one thing as food for thought, though. I contributed a minor patch to two forks. I was granted a small amount of dogecoins (about $.10) for one of those contributions. The notion that there would be a remuneration model behind that rather unique type of open-source project tells a lot about how lacking we are. We miss economic models for the free capabilities we build. Things like Gittip only just emerge, but the way they solve the problem of having multiple people be granted a fair share of buying power based on their contributions don&#x27;t actually rely on a robust mathematical model, and are very probably flawed at scale. That is true of Gittip, it is true of Flattr (notably irrelevant when dealing with a team), it is even true of the Bitcoin ecosystem, given the absence of a proof for the convergence of its volatility.<p>Those challenges raised by the amazing prospect of a truly decentralized economy are greater than building an app on top of a peer-to-peer network of video distribution. They wouldn&#x27;t be the first to direct their efforts there, either; a famous TPB member created Flattr after putting his TPB past behind.<p>PS: on the issue of the struggle for equitable remuneration, here is an outstanding blog post by someone working in a cooperative called Igalia; he did contractor work on V8 and Firefox for Bloomberg: <a href=""http://wingolog.org/archives/2013/06/25/time-for-money"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wingolog.org/archives/2013/06/25/time-for-money</a>",1398000701

I currently use globals within environments to set things that rarely change like API keys and secret but it doesn&#x27;t work for things that change in every invocation for eg., it would be nice if I can save the access token of an oath call in $token and then refer only to $token in other protected resources.",1397999237

7616661,comment,7615121,7615454,4,0,jpatokal,,,"This comes up regularly.  Quoting myself from an earlier comment:<p><i>So the BBC is... weird. The majority of the operation is a taxpayer-funded public broadcaster with a remit to produce high quality programming for free; but there&#x27;s a unit called BBC Worldwide whose job it is to battle it out in the red-in-tooth-and-claw world of commercial TV programming, selling BBC programmes overseas and minting money that can then be used to subsidize the public broadcasting component.</i><p><i>While this sounds laudable as an idea, for this to work it also means that the British taxpayer is not allowed to subsidize BBC Worldwide in any way. For example, BBCW pays rent at market rates for its office space to the rest of the BBC, even though they&#x27;re in the same building, and they&#x27;re virtually prohibited from selling anything in the UK. Add in the fact that the rest of the British media business is (understandably) quite pissed off about having a competitor that operates under a different set of rules, meaning they watch it like a hawk and squawk as soon as there&#x27;s even a hint of unfair advantage, and you get all sorts of bizarro-world conflicts and overblown solutions like this that throw the baby out with the bathwater.</i><p><i>(Disclaimer: I used to work for a company owned by BBC Worldwide. This is my personal opinion.)</i><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5983497"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5983497</a>",1397999081

7616658,comment,7615750,7616595,3,0,acqq,,,"Thanks. Now I see that my preferred approach would collide with current declaration logic of having mut ref and & in front of the names. Otherwise it would seem possible<p><pre><code>    foo := Foo { x: (1, 2), y: 3 };\n    Foo { x: tuple @ (a, b), .. } := foo; \n    ( x: mut, y: ref, &z ) := (1, 2, &3);\n    xx: mut := 33;\n</code></pre>\nI see that having &quot;x: mut&quot; has one character more than &quot;mut x&quot; but I don&#x27;t believe it makes the text less readable, quite the contrary because it&#x27;s certainly less surprising when everything that describes the variable follows the &quot;:&quot;<p>Thanks a lot, I&#x27;ve certainly learned more about Rust this way.",1397998929

10498517,comment,10483800,10485997,0,0,laughinghan,,,"Sufficient pressure is actually exactly the problem, but it shouldn&#x27;t be necessary to think about that. I&#x27;m just saying, intuitively, could you imagine pumping steam through condensing coils and the water around it <i>boiling</i> as a result? Like say you&#x27;re boiling some water on the stove and steam is rising out of it. If you held a cup of water in that steam, how much steam would it take to <i>boil</i> that cup of water?<p>Keep in mind water vapor is lighter than dry air of the same temperature; it takes up about 2000x as much volume as the same mass of liquid water. The vast majority of the steam that goes into a practical condensing coil will come right out the other side, only a tiny amount of the steam that&#x27;s in very close proximity to the surface of the coil will actually condense, which like, if you imagine steam going into a curly metal pipe immersed in water, I&#x27;d hope it&#x27;s intuitive that tons of steam would make it out.<p>You&#x27;d need crazy long and thin pipes, crazy high pressure, and crazy pipe configurations so there&#x27;s way more steam surface area than water being heated, in order to boil water with the equivalent amount of steam.<p>There&#x27;s other tradeoffs here, of course. Both solar panels and reverse osmosis machines are expensive, they&#x27;re like fancy machined semiconductors and ceramics and stuff, whereas an evaporator is some metal pipes and tanks and maybe some glass or mirrors, so depending on application they may be much more cost effective. But in terms of efficiency, there&#x27;s no comparison.",1446544683

10498511,comment,10498473,10498473,0,0,hellofunk,,,"I really wish there was a reasonable answer to this question. I lived in Singapore for many years, and its proximity to Sumatra, where most of the burning is happening, is a huge burden on everyone in Singapore for most times of the year, and it is getting worse. I was there during the 2013 haze crisis and had to leave Singapore for several days just to get a breath of healthy air. Birds were dying in-flight and roads had flocks of them dead all over the pavement, and on park grounds. Yet nothing changes. This year, the haze crisis has been its worst in 20 years, and Indonesia fails to address it. It is illegal to start these fires, but the law is not enforced. If this happened in proximity to a nation like the U.S., after numerous warnings, the country would just cross borders without permission and put out the fires. But no one will do that in SE Asia. Singapore and Malaysia have every right to protect their citizens, but they also respect the sovereignty of Indonesia, so aside from public comments by leaders, they do nothing, and nothing changes. Even if you don&#x27;t live in SE  Asia, it is a devastating reality for the whole planet. Massive rainforest are getting destroyed.<p>After decades of no action by Indonesia, it is clear the only way to fix this is for neighboring nations to be more forceful and go in there and do something about it. But fear of conflict in SE Asia is high, so I&#x27;m worried that this problem is only going to get worse without worldwide pressure by major nations.",1446544514

When I said &quot;there is no better way to do it&quot;, I meant that interacting with tools through the command line (or shell scripts) is the best way we have of doing these kinds of tasks.  I didn&#x27;t say so explicitly, but my intention was to include all of the usual tools that one would use (grep, awk, make, whatever).<p>Though it was several decades ago, I also suffered greatly from having to deal with poorly built academic projects.  It&#x27;s not even confined to academia.  A friend of mine often tells a tale of a start up who spent 3 years building software only to discover that they had built such a mess that they <i>couldn&#x27;t deploy</i> (never having done it in 3 years... :-P).  The company ran out of money before they solved the issue.<p>I may be wrong, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what the original article was complaining about.  I think he was frustrated that while the tools were very good, they were hard to teach to his students.  He wishes there were easier to learn systems for doing this work.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think it will ever happen because the problem space is quite complicated.  You can make it easier to learn by restricting what it can do, but eventually you butt up against that ceiling, making it extremely difficult to use.  That&#x27;s why we are all still using these same tools decades years later (although, I&#x27;m quite happy to ditch make in favour of more modern equivalents [1])<p>I can&#x27;t tell you the number of times I&#x27;ve wandered into a new project and spent every spare second writing README files, fixing the build systems, removing dead code, etc.  I&#x27;ve even worked on projects where there wasn&#x27;t a single person who knew how to build the entire project -- all they could do was compile individual files and link it to pre-built libraries.  They thought me crazy for even wanting to know how to build it.  We do our industry a grave disservice by not teaching this stuff somewhere in our education system.<p>[1] Says the guy who just wrote a new make file a couple of weeks ago <whistling>",1446542441

You can change a maximum of 10,000 TD at a time, equivalent to ~$5,000 USD, and if you did it many times, they&#x27;d probably stop letting you do so.<p>As the Tunisian economy reels from the crash of the tourism industry due to terrorism, all of the new startups are starting to cater to entrenched upper middle class Tunisians who&#x27;s family money is stuck here. The policy kind of enforces saving money, and buys a bit of time for the economy if things go awry.  It also creates a lot of animosity for the Tunisians who&#x27;d much rather have Euros to invest properly.<p>Economic policy is fascinating stuff. Any other fun stories out there?",1446541235

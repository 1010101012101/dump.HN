To an average user who doesn&#x27;t want to read, I would expect them to just press OK because it seems like a standard first time user startup screen. Would &quot;cancel&quot; close the app? I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if most opt-ins were not truly intentional.<p>To me this is a dark pattern.

Mostly its been in the other direction (take off orders of magnitude)<p>But the scenario you&#x27;re citing isn&#x27;t the central issue when it comes to deflation. Deflation leads to a negative spiral because it pays off to defer any kind of spending - thereby slamming on the economic brakes. Notable example is Japan in 90s - deflation has been a major factor in its meagre growth then and even into the 2000s. The BoJ&#x27;s unwillingness to adopt a sufficiently expansionary monetary policy likely exacerbated the problem",1391029134

7146832,comment,7144934,7144934,6,0,Beltiras,,,"I work at a newspaper as a programmer for the website.  Mostly my job is backend programming, some HTML and CSS work (mostly left to designers).  I run our local computer infrastructure as well as manage a cluster for our online presence and assist in technology related journalism as well as assisting our CEO in managing the IT budget.<p>I inherited a mess of an architecture and am finally getting around to rewriting our deployment process.  We buy VM services from a local outfit and the prices are basically an arm and a leg for rather small machines.  Due to this my predecessor put in place an insane deployment script.  It pulls the new version from github then reloads code on the running dynos, one after another.  Reverting is out of the question with our current approach to VCS (something I am also fixing).  Most of the time this is no problem, all we are changing really is some template code, or introducing new models and their views.<p>Thinking back I am quite happy we don&#x27;t run into more problems than we do, but also happy that this type of insanity is soon in the rearview mirror.<p>The worst mistake was recently, cost us about 4 hours of downtime during the busiest time of the day.<p>A big feature on all news sites are lists of stories to present to the user to look at after they have read what you put in front of them at the moment.  They may take the form of most viral, most read, most commented, sliced by time or category or many other factors.  My predecessor had written all those lists statically, which made maintenance a nightmare and extension very fragile.<p>I made a function that was a <i>generic</i> list of items.  You supply basic parameters, amongst them a QuerySet for what would construct the list and my function would check to see if it was cached and if it wasn&#x27;t, generate it and cache it.<p>The framework I use (Django) generally uses lazy evaluation for all QuerySets and I rarely have to think about the size of the list I generate, I just take care to limit the query before I list() it.  During development nothing showed up as a problem and I deployed this and all seemed to be good with the world.<p>A week passes by where I made at least 2 minor deploys (small changes to templates, minor tweaks to list filters) and all seemed to be good with the world.<p>Designer sends me a pull request, I look over the code, just some garden-variety template changes, nothing that should raise an eyebrow.  Make the merge, plan to deploy and then go to lunch.  Deployment done, all seems well for 2 minutes but then suddenly servers lit on fire.  Pages spewed 404&#x27;s and 500&#x27;s like there was no tomorrow.<p>For 4 hours I tear my hair out, examine every piece of code I was deploying <i>that day</i>, call in the big gun support (the kind that costs more money than I care to think about).  Everything I was looking at pointed to the caching agent not working.  Too many pageviews requesting the database, too much load on the servers, reboots made them work fine for about a minute but then everything became bogged down.<p>The big gun support pointed something out finally that I had missed: Traffic from the database to the dynos was abnormally high.  Made me take a look at code that had been there for a while and lo and behold: For some reason when you pass a QuerySet as a parameter, it seems to be evaluated for the receiving function!  2 lines of code added, one deploy, problem fixed.<p>I have no idea to this day how this code could be live for a week without causing problems but an unrelated change triggers the bad behavior.  This is not be the first time I&#x27;ve seen strange behavior from code, having seen a Heisenbug in Java code.<p>There&#x27;s a happy ending to this.  I made a big mea culpa slideshow where I pointed out all the flaws and what we needed to do to prevent a re-occurence.  I got support to make the changes needed and my new cluster goes live day after tomorrow.  Now I can carefully change NEW dynos for a deployment, keeping the old one&#x27;s around if the shit hits the fan.  I got some changes instituted in how we approach VC, something that&#x27;s hampered work for a while.  And we save money in the long run because we will no longer be paying an arm and a leg for the VMs (AND I got to learn about clustering machines with HA, goodstuff with gravy).",1391029112

When I said all useful programs halt, the kinds of programs I meant are the kind used to prove things about computation. Those programs are simplified abstractions of real programs, and they generally compute one result and then halt (if they halt). Being simple makes those programs easier to use in proofs than real programs. However, the proofs still generalize to real programs; a real-world program with multiple functions is equivalent to several single-function programs glued together together.<p>So my point in saying that all useful programs halt was really to argue that all useful programs must have the constraint that they their behavior is always predictable, or controllable, in some sense. In a trivial way, computers are always predictable, but Turing proved that there are cases where it&#x27;s impossible to predict the eventual outcome of a program in advance, i.e., the halting problem. In precise terms, the outcome (halt/not halt) of some programs is said to be undecidable or uncomputable. Undecidability is a hallmark of Turing machines. But since real programs are written by humans, who can&#x27;t solve undecidable problems, real programs will never be able to gain any advantage from undecidable behavior.",1391028614

New price points, more plans, change the show interface, add another option here, etc. The plan had been to do a free preview show the day before to work out the kinks. That didn&#x27;t happen.<p>The time leading up to show start was pretty tense, lots of updates, even a few last minute changes! Then the show actually started, brief relief. The chat system built in started deleting messages, one of those last minute feature changes had screwed up automatic old-message deletion. We had a fix though, update the JS, and bounce everyone out of the show and back in so the JS updates. Fixed!<p>Then the CEO pointed out that the quality just kept getting worse. Turns out that while the video player had both a numeric value and a string description for the different quality levels, it assumed they were in ascending order. So once it confirmed it could stream well at a given level, it automatically tried the next, which worked! Poor quality for everyone. Fixed, and another bounce.<p>Then it was over, time to go home. Back in the next day to finish off the billing code. I decided to approach it like a time card system.

If your app is hosted on EC2 you can even have the entire process be bandwidth free as user-to-S3 uploads are free and S3-to-app-server downloads to EC2 are free.

So you need to get AWS credentials onto your EC2 instances somehow, which is a nontrivial problem if you are automatically spinning up servers. IAM roles solve this by providing each EC2 instance with a temporary set of credentials in the instance metadata that gets automatically rotated. Libraries like boto know to transparently fetch, cache, and refresh the temporary credentials before making API calls.<p>When you create an IAM role, you give it access to only the things it needs, e.g., read/write access to a specific S3 bucket, rather than access to everything.",1391028120

7146685,comment,7146005,7146405,15,0,api,,,"Interestingly, living forever is not a common desire among humans. As we age, our desire for longevity generally diminishes. Having children also seems to satiate some kind of internal biological self-preservation instinct, reducing the fear of death. (Which makes biological sense.)<p>The simple fact is that we only fear death because our genes want to survive. Once that is accomplished -- or once we pass the age of reproduction -- the alien goddess of biology stops whispering that terror into our hindbrains. Myths of hells and grave-monsters and rotting corpses cease to haunt us so deeply. The desire to just <i>be here</i> becomes less intense.<p>I would like to extend my life, but not because I fear death. I have children. It doesn&#x27;t scare me all that much, really, though I would of course be afraid if it were staring me in the face. But I&#x27;d like to extend my life so that I could experience a kind of extended late-life in order to pursue intellectual ventures of high value and long-term focus. I&#x27;d love it if after kids, after ordinary biological life, I could basically become a monk-academic-entrepreneur and dedicate a century or two to art, science, philosophy, etc.<p>Edit:<p>In addition, through Gates&#x27; philanthropy, his selfish genes are in fact increasing their fitness. All those people in Africa are walking around with 99.999999% the same genetic material that&#x27;s inside Bill Gates. He <i>is</i> them from a genetic point of view. So his actions are &quot;genetically rational&quot; from a perspective of selfish-gene self-preservation.<p>Lots of human behavior makes more sense through this lens. Why, for example, do we exercise moderation in war? Because the enemy carries our genes. The whole point of war is probably evolutionary stimulation from a perspective of selfish-gene logic. My guess is that if we went to war against hostile aliens there would be absolutely <i>no</i> mercy or moderation. It would be all-out war, no holds barred.<p>I do not disagree with the parent poster though.

It took a second to realize where the problem was, but I quickly committed the fix and the issue was resolved.<p>Why it happened: a pretty simple string comparison was being done improperly, the fix was at most 1 line (I can&#x27;t remember the exact fix).

One of the things we were doing was patching and updating their server and installing a tape drive backup system.  Server was NT4.<p>I&#x27;m in there doing work after 5pm, and wrongly assume that everyone&#x27;s gone home for the day.  Install some patches and the server asks me if I want to reboot.  I say yes.  Few moments later, a guy sticks his head into the server room and asks if I&#x27;d shut down or rebooted the server.  Oh, whoops, someone&#x27;s here.  Yeah, I just installed some patches.  Oh, OK, see ya.<p>Next day?  Turns out he had been doing some work in their database where they track and manage visa applications.  That database got corrupted when I did the server reboot while he was doing his work.  That night, the backup process then overwrote the previous good copy database on the tape drive with the newly corrupted database.  We had not yet started rolling over multiple tapes to prevent backups of corrupt data, though we were going to purchase some tapes for that purpose shortly.<p>Summer was ending, and I quit a week later to return to school.  Horrible timing in terms of quitting!  No idea what happened after that, as I was spending the summer in a city that was not my own.

7146587,comment,7145691,7146283,6,0,dredmorbius,,,"There is, however, access in a number of regions where geothermal can be quite useful.<p>Iceland doesn&#x27;t have a large population (332,000), but it&#x27;s relatively close to Europe (or at least Ireland), and there have been proposals to link it via undersea transmission cables to the European grid.<p>Other significant resources exist around much of the Pacific Rim, including in Hawaii (limited population and a long way from nowhere), Japan (high population and critical energy resource ocnstraints), the Philippines, New Zealand, and the Pacific coast of the US.  One of the largest present geothermal installations is The Geysers in California, with just under 1 GW of installed capacity.  The largest geothermal resource within the US would be the Yellowstone supercaldera, and though this is presently protected from development, it represents a vast energy potential, as much as 20% of present US electric generating potential under some estimates.  The National Park Status means that research is highly limited, so take with a very strong dose of salt.<p>Other significant resources exist in Kenya (another rift zone, as is New Zealand).  Given Africa&#x27;s status as a developing region, this is potentially hugely useful.<p>Geothermal has been significantly developed in many of these areas.  I did some digging and apparently the Philippines has developed as much as 50% of its potential, where it provides 16% of the nation&#x27;s electricity needs.  Japan and the US have also done considerable development, as, of course, has Iceland.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_power_in_the_Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_power_in_the_Philip...</a><p>Geothermal offers a number of very useful characteristics in a renewable / sustainable energy mix, including:<p>⚫ Base-load potential.  Geothermal runs 24/7, is dispatchable (that is, you can throttle it up or down), and balances the nondispatchable nature of wind and solar energy.<p>⚫ Proven.  Geothermal has been in active commercial production for decades.  This is proven technology.<p>⚫ Relatively low local impacts.  Plant footprints are small and local environmental disturbance fairly limited.  Water needs and the possibility of locally-induced earthquakes (most minor) are possible concerns.<p>But it is still limited to specific locations for high yields.  And if you&#x27;re drawing sufficient amounts of thermal energy from even high-yield caldera, it can take a considerable period of time (decades) for a geothermal zone to recover.  This is particularly a concern with &quot;EGS&quot; (enhanced geothermal systems) in which boreholes are drilled into otherwise only marginal zones.  Often a single borehole&#x27;s useful life is limited to a decade or two.",1391027403

He&#x27;s explicitly saying the opposite: that in many countries with plenty of foreign cash flowing in most people will remain poor and very limited in their opportunities to change that due to inadequate institutions, even if they have access to the mobile telephones and antibiotics their parents didn&#x27;t and shinier public buildings in the capital city. Gates points to oil-rich Gabon&#x27;s per capita incomes being &quot;nearly&quot; where the US was in the 1960s, but in 1960 the average American had access to running water and had a life expectancy significantly higher than 55... Gabon might have the income of a &quot;middle-income&quot; country but a large proportion of the population lives in exactly the same way as people in a nearby very poor countries. The problem here is that even though there&#x27;s enough oil money going into Gabon to ensure the average person has an adequate standard of living, that money is so badly distributed there&#x27;s a fair chance that Bill will have to chip in for people in Gabon to have  malaria nets and HIV tests.<p>In reality, I think they&#x27;re talking past each other and would probably end up on agreeing on most points that actually matter: I don&#x27;t think Gates brought up book titles to ridicule the idea that reforms are necessary for poor countries to prosper, and I doubt Kay objects to Gates&#x27; current level of spending on malaria nets.",1391027349

Surely if Manning&#x27;s own identity can only be understood from his/her own perspective, then my own meaning -- whether I am being disrespectful -- can only be seen from my perspective. How dare you project disrespect into what I am communicating.<p>It is clear that Chelsea Manning is a woman and should be referred to as such. She had a very public message about this. Continuing to refer to Manning with him/his pronouns is being disrespectful. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you don&#x27;t understand or believe in trans* as an identity or that people can actually switch their gender, you are intentionally ignoring what someone publicly asked others to do in a way that is most certainly disrespectful.<p>> What I said was that someone who is not transgendered might claim that they are in order to get some sexual kicks, or to subvert legal protections afforded to women. I&#x27;m not trying to take away from the genuinely transgendered, I&#x27;m saying that the claim of being transgendered can be misused.<p>The reality is that nobody does this. The kind of discrimination and violence trans* people face makes it unlikely that someone would pretend to be trans* for a period of time. Without actual evidence of this happening in a way that systemically abuses legal protections or considerations (of which trans* people get less than the rest of us), this is a false argument.<p>> I believe that I made clear in my post that I was largely in agreement, but was playing devil&#x27;s advocate in order to draw out some deeper understanding -- just vanilla Socratic method stuff. Your reply seems to indicate that someone who is not fully up to speed ought to just shut up, and accept what his betters are telling him.<p>Nobody needs to play devil&#x27;s advocate for transphobic viewpoints, those ideas and actions happen all the time in society today. There is very real data and anecdote about all the things we&#x27;ve talked about. There is no deeper understanding being drawn out here, the arguments you made are common transphobic arguments that don&#x27;t hold up (confusing gender with sexual identity, confusing gender with biology, unalike comparison with a gender pronoun and a title, appeal to society at large to define trans* identity, gender pronouns as unimportant, straw man arguments about people pretending to be trans<i>, separation of trans</i> women from other women as an identity, etc.).<p>> Something I don&#x27;t get here. I&#x27;m married to someone of a different race. I don&#x27;t see what that has to do with my identity. The fact that my wife and I are married and of differing races, has nothing to do with who I am or who I expect people to see me as. She&#x27;s my wife, I&#x27;m her husband, and that&#x27;s all there is to it. I fail to see how this is expecting someone to change, or even have, any view of my personal identity.<p>That is fine if you don&#x27;t consider such a relationship to be a part of your identity in that way. That is for you to define. For some people, their relationship with others does form a part of their identity in a way they consider meaningful. The point is that we don&#x27;t automatically disqualify that part of said person&#x27;s identity. When we do disqualify those things, those attitudes are tied to things like racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and so on.<p>Chelsea Manning is a woman and asked everyone to refer to her as such. That is all there is to it. There is no need to try and justify misgendering this person for any reason.",1391027003

Kay on the other hand focuses on what has gone wrong and is still going wrong and why, and thus is deserving of being paid attention to by people with the power and intent to change things (like Bill Gates for example). This is constructive criticism.",1391025897

7146384,comment,7144934,7144934,105,0,patio11,,,"I&#x27;ve only cried literal tears once in the last ten years, over business.  Due to inattention while coding during an apartment move, I pushed a change to Appointment Reminder which was poorly considered.  It didn&#x27;t cause any immediate problems and passed my test suites, but the upshot is it was a time bomb that would inevitably bring down the site&#x27;s queue worker processes and keep them down.<p>Lesson #1: Don&#x27;t code when you&#x27;re distracted.<p>Some hours later, the problem manifested.  The queue workers came down, and AR (which is totally dependent on them for its core functionality) immediately stopped doing the thing customers pay me money to do.  My monitoring system picked up on this and attempted to call me -- which would have worked great, except my cell phone was in a box that wasn&#x27;t unpacked yet.<p>Lesson #2a: If you&#x27;re running something mission critical, and your only way to recover from failure means you have to wake up when the phone rings, make sure that phone stays on and by you.<p>Later that evening I felt a feeling of vague unease about my change earlier and checked my email from my iPad.  My inbox was full of furious customers who were observing, correctly, that I was 8 hours into an outage.  Oh dear.  I ssh&#x27;ed in from the iPad, reverted my last commit, and restarted the queue workers.  Queues quickly went down to zero.  Problem solved right?<p>Lesson #3: If at all possible, avoid having to resolve problems when exhausted/distracted.  If you absolutely must do it, spend ten extra minutes to make sure you actually understand what went wrong, what your recovery plan is, and how that recovery plan will interact with what went wrong first.<p>AR didn&#x27;t use idempotent queues (Lesson #4: Always use idempotent queues), so during the outage, every 5 minutes on a cron job every person who was supposed to be contacted that day got one reminder added to the queue.  Fortuitously, AR didn&#x27;t have all that many customers at the time, so only 15 or so people were affected.  Less than fortuitously, those 15 folks had 10 to 100 messages queued, each.  As soon as I pressed queues.restart() AR delivered all of those phone calls, text messages, and emails.  At once.<p>Very few residential phone systems or cell phones respond in a customer-pleasing manner to 40 simultaneous telephone calls.  It was a total DDOS on my customers&#x27; customers.<p>I got <i>that</i> news at 3 AM in the morning Japan time, at my new apartment, which didn&#x27;t have Internet sufficient to run my laptop and development environment to see e.g. whose phones I had just blown up.  Ogaki has neither Internet cafes nor taxis available at 3 AM in the morning.  As a result, I had to put my laptop in a bag and walk across town, in the freezing rain, to get back to my old apartment, which still had a working Internet connection.<p>By the time I had completed the walk of shame I was drenched, miserable, and had magnified the likely impact that this had on customers&#x27; customers in my own mind.  Then I got to my old apartment and checked email.  The first one was, as you might expect, rather irate.  And I just lost it.  Broke down in tears.  Cried for a good ten minutes.  Called my father to explain what had happened, because I knew that I had to start making apology calls and wasn&#x27;t sure prior to talking to him that I&#x27;d be able to do it without my voice breaking.<p>The end result?  Lost two customers, regained one because he was impressed by my apology.  The end users were mostly satisfied with my apologies.  (It took me about two hours on the phone, as many of them had turned off their phones when they blew up.)<p>You&#x27;d need a magnifying glass to detect it ever happened, looking on any chart of interest to me.  The software got modestly better after I spent a solid two weeks on improved fault tolerance and monitoring.<p>Lesson the last: It&#x27;s just a job/business.  The bad days are usually a lot less important in hindsight than they seem in the moment.",1391025818

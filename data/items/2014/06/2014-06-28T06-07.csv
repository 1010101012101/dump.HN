7957655,comment,7954905,7954905,1,0,Im_Talking,,,"Jeez, everyone is talking incubators, YC, angels, etc. People don&#x27;t realise that this type of money is the most expensive you will EVER get. And trying to get this funding will consume your business for the better part of a year, at least, with everything else on-hold to the point where you have neglected the actual business long enough that you will need the funding, and die without it.<p>Bootstrap for as long as you can. Be smart. Be imaginative. Seek out partnerships with customers as they can be a great source of money/advise/contacts if they feel it can benefit them. Sounds like customers love the concept, so get them to pony-up some money or contacts. Then, the cheapest money is the money you don&#x27;t need.<p>Equity should be treated as gold. And a lot of founders who create successful businesses kick themselves for the mindless throwing-around of equity in the early stages.<p>I would suggest setting-up an advisory board. I&#x27;m sure you and your co-founders will know several smart people, or ask customers who they recommend.",1403938627
7957654,comment,7955734,7955734,5,0,dzink,,,"Negotiations or market research?<p>When Staples started, the founder proved the concept of an office-oriented superstore meticulously with a single store in the northeast. He picked a neighborhood, mapped every business around it, knew exactly how many accountants and offices were around his area through a survey, you get the idea. With the evidence, he talked to a number of investors. One investor gave him a pretty high valuation. In a meeting with another investor soon after, the investor asked a number of questions,  hmm-ed the answers and escorted the founder out the door. In investor then promptly returned to his desk, opened up his rolodex and called the best retail exec on the list to start what is now Office Depot - in a different part of the country, to avoid a direct clash, because chains such as these expand geographically.<p>While this is an extreme case, it is not uncommon. Many investors who like a business idea from one startup, look up and talk to every competitor in order to pick their best bet for the race to that market. If the research surfaces a better competitor, the firm doesn&#x27;t invest or choses the competitor. If it didn&#x27;t it is useful as &quot;market research&quot; to help the startup. Either way, the entrepreneurs share plenty of information to appear attractive, and probably feel good about the VC attention they are getting. The &quot;ideas are worth nothing&quot; mantra is out there for a reason - execution is everything at the end of the entrepreneurial race.<p>The really sleazy negotiations happen when the competing firm starts applying &quot;cloning&quot; tactics to misinform or undercut its opponent. For example, having multiple uninterested parties call the seller with really low prices to create the impression the item for sale is worth little. Then the actual buyer comes in with a low offer that looks lush in comparison. Prepare for the worst and do your due diligence thoroughly if you are worried about this kind of stuff.",1403938512

I should be able to anticipate the behavior in a future context.<p>They are touting this supposed underlying physical metaphor (almost as if that is their own newly developed idea in UI), but it sure looks like a mask over the fact that they just threw in a bunch of shiny animations everywhere with much less regard for physical metaphor and reproducibility than one should expect.",1403938468

7957648,comment,7919850,7921307,1,0,trendoid,,,"You are probably not seeing this but your point needs refutation.<p>Dawkins model(not his actually but he presented to general public) was not competition-centric. Main idea was gene centric view of life. Competition, cooperation, symbiosis etc all were explained from the genes point of view. The thing to note is, even when we see apparent &#x27;cooperation&#x27; between species, at the genes level there is a competition with other gene pools. So the non-competitive forces look so on the surface, but the only thing genes care about is moving on to the next generations and spreading as much copies as possible even if that happens with symbiosis.<p>Gould on the other hand, was not happy with this selfish view of life(everyone says he had Marxist ideologies which made him a bit bias). He thought of selection as happening at multiple levels, not just limited at genes but also species and individual. This was the main controversy between him and dawkins.<p>So, to reply to GPs query, yes that quote is sort of incorrect since  everyone agreed that cooperation and symbiosis(Darwin too) are very much part of evolution.",1403938320

Think postman arrives, asks you to pull out your ID and sign something, hits okay. Company knows that you are a real person with the specified name living at that place. They _might_ have access to the number on your national ID afterwards, but I&#x27;m not even sure about that one.<p>Have you checked what kind of documents you&#x27;re to send to a random foreign company for verification?<p>On top of that, the process doesn&#x27;t WORK internationally. I still don&#x27;t understand what kind of utility bills you have in Israel (StartSSL) or the US (usually the source for.. things), but mine are different. Plus, what does a random letter in a random language prove? Sending in an ID is understandable - it&#x27;s a state issued document and protected by law, forging one would be a Bad Idea. A &quot;utility bill&quot;... Well, as I said: Insane. And arbitrary.<p>For the fun of it I looked up the mail exchange.<p>Documents they asked for (* denoting that I sent them):<p>- Mobile bill<p>- Utility bill* (sent a cable provider&#x27;s bill)<p>- Passport & ID *<p>(I think I provided my driving license as well)<p>The first two documents are absolutely braindead requirements. They certainly don&#x27;t have the expertise to know all utility providers/mobile network providers on a global level. So I could hand in ANYTHING and it would a) be probably legal (there&#x27;s no law to prevent me from &#x27;forging&#x27; a utility bill.tell ..) and impossible to prove. That is .. unless they call your utility/mobile provider to check the information, which wouldn&#x27;t work in the first place (data protection laws) unless you IMPERSONATE the person you try to check. Which would be crazy on a different level.<p>In the end they wanted to send me a registered letter by snail mail and I cancelled the whole ordeal. Doing that would&#x27;ve been an option of course, but not after they asked for random documents proving my address. EITHER send me a registered letter OR ask for crazy stuff that contains my name and address in the header.<p>Plus, transparency. This whole process took a while and was a lot of &quot;Now please send this&quot;, &quot;We really need that&quot;, &quot;Since you have no mobile bill to offer, we fall back to snail mails&quot;. I discovered this in painful mails, after handing over enough of my data to do mostly anything in my name.<p>I fail to understand how this process could be acceptable and I certainly consider it broken, hostile and inefficient.<p>(Handing in my utility bill was difficult as well - I blacked out all but the letter head, which caused them to complain again and again.

Or stop a particular candidate being elected?  Etc.<p>Perhaps they will use this for good, as you mention.  But its still huge power for a corporation to wield; effectively in secret - its easy enough for an observer to make a judgement about a bias in e.g. Fox News, and call that out - but it&#x27;d be very hard to observe subtle changes to individual news feeds.<p>I don&#x27;t really buy your argument that they have a clear moral responsibility to develop this capability. That depends on the potential good of such capability if used for good, the potential bad if used for bad, and the chance it will be used for each.\nSo I don&#x27;t see this as analogous to a corporation conducting a clinical trial of a drug; this is more analogous to a clinical trial of a drug that could also be used as a weapon, with the more complicated ethical issues that would entail.<p>I think its absolutely something there should be ethical discussion around.",1403935620

10953021,comment,10951545,10951763,0,0,swang,,,"You&#x27;re right, I should not equate English with pinyin. I think however, pinyin as the solution is more indicative of how Western focused (especially with the proliferation of English) the entire world is. Or at least specifically with this author&#x27;s viewpoint.<p>I have learned pinyin, and basically it is the easiest way to input onto a US-English keyboard (as he says), but you essentially lose all underlying meaning of the character&#x27;s history if you&#x27;re learning Chinese based off pinyin. Essentially the same as removing all meaning of what a prefix, suffix and root of a word is in English. For example: &quot;Imperialism&quot;: I am sure you can tell me that the suffix is (&quot;-ism&quot;) and what it&#x27;s meaning is (&quot;belief in&quot;/advocacy) and you can probably tell me the origins/meanings of &quot;Imperial&quot; (empire) and so if you put those two words together an English speaking person would understand &quot;Imperialism&quot; as advocacy of an empire. But what is &quot;Imperialism&quot; in English if it is spelled &quot;diguozhuyi&quot;? That is what you lose when you switch to a pure romanization. And writing this post to you know makes me realize what I hate so much about the article. He throws away any meaning Chinese characters have for the sake of simplicity for his self benefit.<p>Taiwan has an alphabet like equivalent called &quot;zhuyin&quot; or bopomofo after the first 4 characters. The author never mentions this because I&#x27;m guessing he just asked some colleague in China rather than look into it. Zhuyin has pros and cons, the 2 biggest cons I see are 1: It wasn&#x27;t invented in mainland China and 2: even the Taiwanese view it as sort of thing a child uses (adults use full Chinese characters). But technically it has about 38 characters, although you could fit it into a qwerty style keyboard based on the assumption that there are only 21/22 characters that can begin a word and 17 that can follow (oversimplification) so it is doable.",1453474741

As a result, OpenDoor’s strategy is steeped with risk, potentially backfiring if the economy tailspins...The company uses mostly debt financing to buy homes, improving returns. Mr. Wu declined to disclose OpenDoor’s debt terms but said they are superior to what a typical home buyer gets on a mortgage.</i><p>The combination of high leverage and complete property ownership seems incredibly risky to me. If the country-wide housing market turns sour, not only is the company left with swiftly depreciating assets on their balance sheet as real estate values drop and people stop buying homes, but they are also left paying (probably 1-2%) interest on houses that they &quot;bought&quot; with these loans for $300k, but that are now worth $200k.<p>But the overall concept of increasing liquidity in the market by cutting out the broker and his/her available hours, &quot;automating&quot; the valuation and bid process, using low short-term interest rates to flip houses, and pricing for volume and quick turnover is pretty cool. The key is sticking to &quot;commodity&quot; housing (cheap-mid range) and timing the market correctly.",1453474649

Almost every single person I&#x27;ve brought this up to will say yes for at least some forms of exploitation.

But that&#x27;s not true. What is actually true is an n-dimensional vector, with an enormous variety of &quot;cleans&quot; and &quot;dirties&quot;, and even more complicated when you start combining the vectors. Plus you don&#x27;t get to custom-design them; you have to take what exists in the world. So when you &quot;clean&quot; yourself with a certain soap of the &quot;dirtiness&quot; you currently have, you don&#x27;t get to custom design a cleaning agent that precisely knocks out only the portions of the &quot;dirty&quot; vector you have, you can only use things that exist, with all their side effects.<p>A lot of things in the real world work like that, but the medical world, since it involves biological bodies, the most complicated things in the known universe, seem particularly prone to this problem. Similarly, if you have a genetic disease where X is overexpressed, but its action is opposed by Y, it isn&#x27;t necessarily a solution to just increase the expression of Y, because where English makes &quot;oppose&quot; sound nice and clean, in reality that&#x27;s a summation of two complicated vectors. For all you know, X and Y also have a way in which they work in the same way, and having a system that overexpresses both will suddenly expose a pathology where the combination of both becomes fatal even so.

I work on Perma.cc at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, the way I think about permanence as a lawyer and programmer is that nothing is really permanent. We have court decisions from hundreds of years ago, for example, but we might easily lose them in the next apocalypse. We&#x27;ve lost lots of records of equal value already. (For a great example, check out the fire-damaged Jefferson collection at the Library of Congress -- there are many published books from Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s personal library that, once they were lost, could never be replaced.)<p>The reason we&#x27;ve kept court decisions as long as we have is that we make lots of copies, and keep them in lots of libraries, and libraries care about hanging on to things.<p>But court decisions now cite to random web pages all the time, and the halflife of a URL is like 18 months. So with Perma we&#x27;re opening up law library shelves to web pages as well as court decisions -- allowing law review, courts, and others to say, &quot;this web page is culturally important enough for me to cite to, so please hang onto it.&quot; To me this is the magical weirdness of the internet -- no one has ever quite had this level of write access to library shelves.<p>This has made a huge difference for web preservation in the legal field in a short period of time -- we now have over half of American law schools signed on to use Perma, several US government agencies, and nine state supreme courts with more on the way.<p>On the backend we&#x27;re building out a private LOCKSS network that will put those records in the hands of lots of libraries. (We&#x27;re hiring for this, by the way -- drop me a line if you&#x27;re in Boston.) We can&#x27;t prove that any of those libraries will still be around in a few decades, but we think it&#x27;s a good bet.<p>Happy to answer any questions ...",1453472710

The way it works is that it will call the init() method of JS app (ready() in jquery, main() in Dart etc). And it is very sub-optimal compared to server side generation. This is because it has to execute the ready()/start() method, which may spawn of some async requests to get some JSON, on getting which successfully you recreate your DOM.<p>So too many possible failure points, and for these reasons it will timeout many times, resulting in increased crawl errors, apart from page load time degradation. I learned this the hard way, and had to revert to server side generation of crawlable pages. And now looking at something like react/redux to achieve what I originally wanted (which is basically again server side generation, but while maintaining the quality of the served pages).",1453472684

Damaged by the rain, the slackened crossbows had \n  little effect on the English line. The English archers shot \n  their bows in retaliation, inflicting heavy casualties on \n  the Genoese, causing them to retreat. The knights and \n  nobles following in Alençon&#x27;s division, seeing the routed \n  mercenaries, hacked them down as they retreated. Froissart \n  writes of the event:\n\n    The English, who were drawn up in three divisions and \n    seated on the ground, on seeing their enemies advance, \n    arose boldly and fell into their ranks... You must know \n    that these kings, earls, barons, and lords of France did \n    not advance in any regular order... There were about \n    fifteen thousand Genoese crossbowmen; but they were quite \n    fatigued, having marched on foot that day six leagues, \n    completely armed, and with their wet crossbows. They told \n    the constable that they were not in a fit condition to do \n    any great things that day in battle. The Count of \n    Alençon, hearing this, was reported to say, &quot;This is what \n    one gets by employing such scoundrels, who fail when \n    there is any need for them.&quot;[29]\n</code></pre>\nSo, it doesn&#x27;t sound like the crossbows were in pristine condition. Rather, their range was limited by the fact that their strings had gotten wet, while the relatively simpler (and easier to string) longbows were able to be protected from the rainstorm.",1453472017

(Additional directory entries are created using hard links.)\n* Each file can have zero or more open file descriptors.\n* Each blob has a reference count, and disk space is able to be reclaimed when the reference count goes to zero.<p>Interestingly enough, this means that &#x27;rm&#x27; doesn&#x27;t technically remove a file - what it does is unlink a directory entry.

10952711,comment,10952112,10952112,0,0,dr0w,,,"tldr: iterate, iterate, iterate.<p>Learning how to generate and test design hypotheses both with and without users is really important. I too am programmer and design did not come naturally at first; I had to develop it through practice (and much failure and dead code). I realized after a while developing good UX is not a linear process its cyclic. I&#x27;ll share some HCI practices that I found worked well for me. These are the steps I usually when making apps for clients or for myself.<p>Before beginning a project I always like to have solid answers to two these questions. They pretty much motivate all my design choices. \n- Who is going to use your app? What drives and motivates them to use your app specifically (i.e. why would they use your app and not something else)?\n- What do they do right now to solve this problem? What is their next best option? What are the problems with the existing solution?<p>Next I&#x27;ll make prototypes. Usually I start with paper and pencil or Powerpoint in a very low fidelity. Though it is tempting, I never write a single line of code until maybe a week or two into this process. Right now, your focus should be in exploring as much of the design space rather than committing to one single possibility - nothing is too crazy or outlandish at this stage. Don&#x27;t use a ruler or be neat - just get it out so you can understand and evaluate it later. Don&#x27;t worry about the technicalities of how things will be implemented you can worry about that later.<p>Once I have enough ideas I pick my 3 winners. The way I do this depends on the specific problem and its constraints - you should base this on the two important questions I mentioned first. For example, if your user is unfamiliar with technolgy, readability and simplicity might take priority over adding a useful but complicated feature. But if he&#x27;s a developer, you might keep the jargon and add the features to enhance his experience. Don&#x27;t stress over this process too much because in the end, this is all just based on just your own educated guesses.<p>Then I make a powerpoint mockup of my favorite idea - basically just slides linking to other slides, with different pictures and animations to make it look like an app. This next step is all about verifying your beliefs and ideas about what you picked. I try to make this as real as possible, adding slides to simulate page loading, using actual iOS or android icons and fonts in my designs but that is a personal choice. Use this mockup to evaluate and test with some users and/or the clients - the things that sometimes you assume or overlook about your users or the problems will surprise you. Consider the feedback and update your assumptions. Now reevaluate your original designs (even the ones you maybe threw out) and fix your mockup. Test it with some users 2-3 times again till no more important issues remain.<p>Now you write your code. This will be your first prototype. Try to be quick and use familiar technology as far as possible. You should have no problems converting your PowerPoint reference to code since you&#x27;ve done it a hundred times before. Add some sort of analytics / tracking so that you can measure important metrics in your app when it comes time to test.<p>Now find a set of users that you would like to test your app with - you could ask friends on HN or Facebook, post on Amazon MTurk or go door to door. Try to get your testers to be as close to the target demographic of your users - ideally your testers ARE your users but sometimes you can&#x27;t be picky. Show your testers the app and get them to use it. If you can, get them to talk aloud as they use it, describing their thoughts process and action in a think aloud. If you can record this process in a video/audio or screen recording so that you can review it later.<p>Now organize that feedback and analyze it. What is the most common complaint/request your users have right now? Are the problems due to design or implementation? What are the differences between your initial mockup and your prototype and how do they affect the result? Based on this analysis improve your designs, update your code. Do it again a few times if necessary. Once your testers are reasonably happy release it to your actual users and see what they say - chances are by now you should have caught and fixed a lot of the design problems that were too domain specific or hard to discover for you alone and your users will be a lot happier!",1453471371

I&#x27;ve got to think that entails things like autonomous (or assisted) driving capability as seen in the recent Tesla updates as well as things like improved accident avoidance, &quot;hailing&quot; features, or self-maintenance. I can certainly see how these software improvements would be compelling.",1453471304

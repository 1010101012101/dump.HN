I don&#x27;t see any public evidence of any of what you are talking about, even in cases like this or the nastiest of the Snowden revelations. I could easily see these actions as those that are not power hungry, and who do not spend their time sitting in leather chairs and petting cats menacingly.<p>People rarely cast themselves as the villains of their life story, and I could definitely imagine this resulting in people in the security services following this logic:<p>1. We are the good guys.\n2. More information <i>always</i> means we can better do our job.<p>∴ grab the laptop, mass wiretapping, etc.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t agree with second premise at all, and I think the first premise overextends &quot;we&quot; to all the people in your organization, now and in the future. But I do think that it is possible many of the people at the NSA, GCHQ, CIA, etc. are actually good people, even the one calling the shots in situations such as this.<p>If your plan for opposing their actions is to assume that they are twirling their mustaches as we speak, and they are not in fact twirling said mustaches, you are putting yourself at a disadvantage. In this case, putting Polonium-210 in strategically placed jars of mustache wax will not work, and neither will trying to expose them as evil power brokers.<p>Vilifying your enemy may help if you&#x27;re planning on military warfare against them, but if your plan is more reasoned understanding those you oppose is likely more useful.",1446195581

In addition, super-optimization will yield better results if you give it a better starting point. It&#x27;s nothing at all like the optimization discussed in the blog post. Either way, it can be done against LLVM IR[4] and I&#x27;m sure it will creep into clang at some point.<p>So far as using profiling data to optimize code in the way that humans would: MSVC supports it[1], clang supports it[2] and gcc supports it[3]. Supposedly Microsoft saw a 30% performance increase [with a very specific workload] when they tried POGO on an internal build of SQL Server.

Additionally, adding GTalk, Facebook Chat etc. into the mix is only going to confuse people because they&#x27;ll assume they&#x27;re secure just by using this app. But in order to have a secure and private conversation you need people on both ends of the conversation to use a client that supports OTR.<p>They mentioned Pond and Ricochet in that post and I&#x27;m a big fan of both but especially Ricochet.

C++ is also pretty slow on its own, but with SIMD intrinsics (or lucky autovectorization [1]) it can be speedy. We&#x27;re talking typically about 1.5 - 10x speedup in performance sensitive code with SIMD vs plain C++. Highest speedup I&#x27;ve seen was about 40x in sorting code. SIMD is a sorting demon.<p>That said, I want safety more than speed. Speed I can get by writing an unsafe extension in C/C++. Safety is very hard to achieve in C/C++. Getting it right is the first priority. That&#x27;s why I see Rust being used instead of where traditionally C++ is the default. Or some other new language that can fill C++&#x27;s shoes. Rust does seem like the strongest candidate at this point.<p>I&#x27;m confident Rust and Golang performance will improve as the projects get more mature. The generated code is full of optimization opportunities.<p>[1]: Autovectorization optimizations by C++ compilers tend to be fragile, small changes will undo them. So far easier to use intrinsics than figure out the black magic for autovectorization optimizations.",1446194356

10476655,comment,10463464,10476435,0,0,lmm,,,"Hmm, the reason I find types clearer than macros is that they do apply everywhere, so there&#x27;s consistency across a codebase. <- will always mean a call to flatMap - which might do something different in one place or another, but only in the same way as a normal polymorphic method call - whereas different macros might use it to mean unrelated things. I think IDEs handle them better too - you can refactor in the normal way, you get types on mouseover. Last time I tried to use Checker it was similar - the IDE has good support for <i>running</i> the checkers, but it can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t apply the right annotations when extracting a method, or show you the checker-inferred types of local variables.<p>I do think implicit conversions allow too much; IMO we need typeclasses and extension methods. So my ideal design for a language would include implicit parameters but not implicit conversions, and instead have dedicated support for extension methods. That said we do need to be able to use typeclasses without disrupting method application syntax (i.e. support the use case that means Spray prefers the implicit-conversion-based &quot;magnet pattern&quot; rather than a typeclass).<p>More generally I think there will be languages that allow too much and languages that ban too much, and we need languages on both sides of the line to allow us to converge on something better. Most places I&#x27;ve worked have had a strong code review/pull request culture which may have coloured my experience - I just haven&#x27;t seen the Scala maintainability problems you talk about.<p>(If I thought the complexity of collections was necessary to avoid casts then I would defend it - casts can fail and so it&#x27;s very nice to have a codebase where they&#x27;re banned entirely (enforced with wartremover). But I don&#x27;t think it is - FWIW Odersky&#x27;s asked for proposals for scala collections in version 3, and I think there&#x27;s a substantial push towards at least some simplification - perhaps replacing CanBuildFrom with a 1-parameter typeclass that would retain most of the power and simplify the code. The showing-off cases like BitSet#map would require one more method call, but no casts)",1446193153

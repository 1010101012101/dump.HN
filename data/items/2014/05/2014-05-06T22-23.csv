In such situations, C++-style RAII is extremely valuable.  While finalizers can be added to languages with garbage collectors, and indeed have been [1][2], it&#x27;s not possible to predict when the resource destruction will occur, meaning that they end up requiring explicit (de)allocation of resources in pratice [3][4].  And if you still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a hard problem, take a look at some of the discussion the D community is currently engaged in over the same issue [5].<p>Another problem with GC that&#x27;s already been brought up is the difficulty of using it in hard realtime systems.  IBM has done a considerable amount of work in this area, including the development of a garbage collector designed specifically for realtime Java programming [6].  Some things to note about their solution include the heavy restrictions on the hard-realtime threads [7] (they are essentially disallowed from interacting with garbage collected objects, and in any case are not totally free of garbage collection), and that what are called realtime threads are still subject to nondeterministic pauses [8].<p>There are many more potential issues than this (e.g. signal handling [9]) but I hope you will agree that there is a clear need for languages without mandatory garbage collection.  Given that such languages are necessary, it follows that it would be nice for there to be <i>safe</i> languages without mandatory garbage collection that can perform these tasks.  While that doesn&#x27;t <i>necessarily</i> mean you should care, it probably does, because even if you don&#x27;t personally write programs with such requirements, you almost certainly use them.<p>[1] C# Destructors, <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/66x5fx1b.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/66x5fx1b.aspx</a><p>[2] Java&#x27;s Object#finalize, <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#finalize()"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.ht...</a><p>[3] .NET&#x27;s IDisposable (often used with using), <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.idisposable.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.idisposable.a...</a> ; see also c# - Proper use of the IDisposable interface, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/538060/proper-use-of-the-idisposable-interface"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/538060/proper-use-of-the-...</a><p>[4] Java&#x27;s AutoCloseable (designed for use with try-with-finally), <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/AutoCloseable.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/AutoClose...</a><p>[5] A few considerations on garbage collection, <a href=""http://forum.dlang.org/thread/ljr549$1kti$1@digitalmars.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.dlang.org/thread/ljr549$1kti$1@digitalmars.com</a> ; More radical ideas about GC and reference counting, <a href=""http://forum.dlang.org/thread/ljrm0d$28vf$1@digitalmars.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.dlang.org/thread/ljrm0d$28vf$1@digitalmars.com</a> ; GC vs Resource Management, <a href=""http://forum.dlang.org/thread/hhpldnysndikzbkfbiqm@forum.dlang.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.dlang.org/thread/hhpldnysndikzbkfbiqm@forum.dla...</a><p>[6] Introduction to the Metronome Garbage Collector, <a href=""http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/realtime/v1r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.rt.doc.10%2Frealtime%2Fmetro_introd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/realtime/v1r0/index...</a> ; Real-time Java, part 4: Real-time garbage collection, <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-rtj4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-rtj4/</a><p>[7] Using no-heap real-time threads, <a href=""http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/realtime/v1r0/topic/com.ibm.rt.doc.10/realtime/noheaprt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/realtime/v1r0/topic...</a> ; in particular, Constraints on Java threads when running with NHRTs, <a href=""http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/realtime/v1r0/topic/com.ibm.rt.doc.10/realtime/nhrt_thread_constraints.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/realtime/v1r0/topic...</a>.<p>[8] Metronome Garbage Collector limitations, <a href=""http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/realtime/v1r0/topic/com.ibm.rt.doc.10/realtime/metro_limit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/realtime/v1r0/topic...</a> ; Metronome behavior in out of memory conditions, <a href=""http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/realtime/v1r0/topic/com.ibm.rt.doc.10/realtime/metro_trouble_oom.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/realtime/v1r0/topic...</a><p>[9] See, for example, Asynchronous Signals in Standard ML, <a href=""http://www.smlnj.org/compiler-notes/90-tr-reppy.ps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smlnj.org/compiler-notes/90-tr-reppy.ps</a> ; section 5.2 gives a good overview of why truly preemptive signal handling, often a necessary part of systems programming, is not in general possible in a system with garbage collection.",1399415884

7707568,comment,7700980,7707373,1,0,kentonv,,,"Compared to Protobuf, there is definitely going to be a trade-off. Protobuf uses variable-width integer encoding whereas SBE uses only fixed-width integers which means there will be a lot of zero-valued high-order bytes and padding taking up space. But variable-width encoding is costly because it involves a lot of unpredictable branching -- this is exactly where SBE&#x27;s speed advantage comes from. The exact amount of overhead will vary depending on usage; it could be about the same size, or it could be many times larger. (This is a general problem with benchmarks of serialization systems: the difference is highly dependent on use case, so you should never assume your own application will see the same kind of performance as any particular benchmark.)<p>Cap&#x27;n Proto also uses fixed-width encoding, but offers an optional &quot;packing&quot; step that is basically a really fast compression pass that aims only to remove zeros. I&#x27;ve found that this usually achieves similar sizes to Protobufs while still being faster, because the packing algorithm can be implemented it a tight loop whereas a Protobuf encoder usually involves sprawling generated code that does all kinds of things. SBE could pretty easily adopt Cap&#x27;n Proto&#x27;s packing algorithm.<p>SBE is probably slightly leaner than Cap&#x27;n Proto because they don&#x27;t use pointers. Instead, SBE outputs the message tree in preorder. Only fixed-width elements are found at fixed offsets; the rest have to be found by traversing the tree. The down side of this is that you want to find one element in a list, you must first traverse all of the elements before it (and all of their transitive children). Cap&#x27;n Proto&#x27;s approach using pointers allows you to process input in the order that is most convenient for you (rather than in the exact order in which it was written) and makes it easy to seek directly to one particular element (which is awesome when you&#x27;re mmap()ing a huge database), but does have a slight cost in terms of message size.",1399415846

And while I believe my English is very far from perfect, at least you can understand me.<p>> simple for who<p>It&#x27;s very common to hear about &quot;simple != easy&quot; on HN (maybe because of R. Hickey, idk) and this is just the case.<p>Easiness = Familiarity (subjective) \nSimplicity = &quot;Does/is one thing&quot; (objective)<p>English has simple grammar compared to most of languages I know, probably compared to most of non-constructed languages at all. It has simple writing system compared to Chinese, objectively. Even &quot;lolcats English&quot; can be understood quite easily, if you know English to some extent. You cannot write &quot;lolcats Chinese&quot;, only pinyin (or kana, for Japanese). If some Japanese shows you a visit-card with his name in kanji only, you often have to ask him (if it&#x27;s not some really common name/surname) how <i>that</i> is pronounced (even if you have seen that kanji before, because there are many variants of pronunciation!). I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s about Chinese, but declension/conjugation in Japanese has far more cases than in Modern English (although probably can be said to be &quot;more regular&quot;). Russian declension is objectively more complicated than English (almost non-existent!). In it&#x27;s turn, Chinese pronunciation is pretty hard to master if you don&#x27;t have concept of tones in your language. I won&#x27;t say anything about English this time, but Chinese pronunciation is objectively more complicated than Japanese, for instance. That means, if you speak Chinese, you won&#x27;t have very hard time repeating what Japanese says, but not otherwise.<p>The concept of &quot;simplicity&quot; is so <i>not bogus</i> that even have been made attempts to invent some language, that will be easy (because it&#x27;s <i>simple</i>!) to speak for everyone (esperanto). But as there are many people that don&#x27;t really care for defragmentation, enlightenment, modernism and stuff like that — so, esperanto is dead now. Maybe it&#x27;s for the better. Anyway, English doesn&#x27;t have to be invented, and it&#x27;s fine, although maybe not perfect as &quot;the universal language&quot;. Fine is fine, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying.",1399415492

The way I read that definition is: if a class has more than 1 responsibility then making a change affecting any one of those responsibilities will require the class to be recompiled where as if those responsibilities were broken up in different classes making a change affecting one responsibility would not affect the other classes.<p>Hence a bug fix does not constitute a &quot;change&quot; since it does not change the responsibility of the class, neither does a refactor for code clarity or performance improvements. The purpose/responsibility of &quot;what&quot; the class does, does not change when you do any of those things.<p>&quot;sometimes a class with more reasons to change is the simplest thing&quot; Could you give an example of this? I can&#x27;t think of one instance.<p>&quot;Stating that &quot;binding business rules to persistence is asking for trouble&quot; is flatly wrong. Au contraire, It&#x27;s the simplest thing to do, and in most cases any other solution is just adding complexity without justification&quot; Now this statement here is flatly wrong precisely for the reason specified in the Uncle Bob&#x27;s example. Let&#x27;s do a thought experiment. Consider that you have an Employee class that is a black box to you. Someone else wrote that code and didn&#x27;t have any exception handling logic in their code. The Employee class did business logic and persistence control. When you tried to use the class there was an error. Now which part of the class was faulty? The business logic part or the persistence control part? Now consider that you needed to use the same Employee class in another project but it needed a different set of business rules but the same persistence control, you would not be able to use this Employee class you would have to create a new one and duplicate your persistence control code.<p>Design principles have been developed to make sure that code written is maintainable, extensible, clear, comprehensible. Sure me as a single developer who is working on a simple project, who knows what each of my class does and has a small enough code base such that I don&#x27;t need to separate the application into layers (e.g. call my database directly from my view because I just need this one value and don&#x27;t want to write a couple of classes to that) can indeed write classes that have more than 1 responsibility.

And when not explicitly looking for it as slang (after all, source code variable names are typically not slang), it is a lot more likely to refer to many other things, including various universities and Services for UNIX.<p>As near as I can tell, you&#x27;re basically just making stuff up at this point.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t think you understand what &quot;metasyntactic&quot; means. WTF in TheDailyWTF is not &quot;metasyntactic&quot;. Neither is naming a variable &quot;SFU&quot;, regardless of what you intended to convey with that name. A metasyntactic variable, by definition, is a placeholder name <i>without meaning</i> that is intended to be substituted with some other context-appropriate thing. &quot;foo&quot; is the most common such variable, &quot;bar&quot; is the second most common. You cannot simultaneously claim something is metasyntactic and also claim that it has meaning.",1399414319

A good design will respond really well (ie., require fewer modifications) to novel use cases. Many people think this means design starting with future use cases. But you really just need to design with good principles. Future use cases are useful however at objectively evaluating designs and resolving arguments, such as Which design is better for futures that we care about?<p>>> Stating that &quot;binding business rules to persistence is asking for trouble&quot; is flatly wrong.

7707353,comment,7707189,7707189,3,0,userbinator,,,"I&#x27;ve found that if you approach OOP from a more pragmatic point of view, metrics like the sizes of classes mean very little: the point of classes is to encapsulate code+data so they can be reused to avoid duplication, so it feels obvious to me that if you see (non-trivial) functionality in a class that is likely to be reused in the future, then extract it into another one, but if you don&#x27;t then there&#x27;s no point in doing so, because it will only increase the overall complexity. Same for OOP in general - it&#x27;s a tool, use it when it makes sense and simplifies the design. Sometimes you don&#x27;t need a class, and sometimes a function doesn&#x27;t belong in one because it does things across several, so all the &quot;which class should this function go in&quot; questions have a straightforward answer to me: if it&#x27;s not immediately obvious which class it goes in, it probably doesn&#x27;t belong in one. I mainly use Asm/C/C++ so I have the luxury of doing this, but I can see how some of the &quot;more-constraining&quot; languages make this more difficult.<p><i>All the examples I see are one-way towards simply creating a million single method classes.</i><p>That&#x27;s a phenomenon that I&#x27;ve definitely seen a lot; often with the accompanying <i>obfuscation</i> that the method bodies have only one or two statements in them, that just calls into some other methods. It may look like it&#x27;s made the code simpler locally, but all it&#x27;s done is spread the complexity out over a wider area and increased it. This isn&#x27;t &quot;well-designed&quot; or &quot;straightforward&quot;, it&#x27;s almost intentional obfuscation. I&#x27;ve seen this effect most with programmers who were taught OO design principles very very early, possibly before they even had a good grasp of concepts like procedures, loops, and conditionals. &quot;When all you have are classes, everything turns into an object.&quot;",1399413618

Their mandates are:\n(a) Acting as a lender of last resort to banks\n(b) Controlling inflation/deflation through monetary policy\n(c) (In some cases, like that of the Fed) ensure unemployment does not breach an ""acceptable"" level.<p>In almost no mandate, is it mentioned that the Central Bank has to monetize sovereign debt (T-Bills, Treasuries, Greek Debt, Spanish debt etc). The ECB isn't legally allowed to do so for very good reasons. Even the Fed doesn't do that - all its Treasury and MBS purchases are from the secondary market.<p>In fact, when the Spanish government directed $19B ECB funds to Bankia via injecting Spanish debt into the bank, it was a covert form of sovereign debt monetization - something the ECB objected to vehemently, but couldn't stop.<p><i>Even Germany could not pay its debt if investors demanded redemption at maturity</i><p>They always demand redemption at maturity - every single one - however, it occurs via a debt-rollover, ie issuing new debt to repay older debt.<p>What Europe needs is that the distortions in the balance-of-payments between countries should be fixed - the liabilities of the Eurozone aren't evenly distributed amongst countries with respect to their capability to service those liabilities (and that indeed is due to irresponsible fiscal behavior). Bu this can't be controlled by monetary policy alone - it requires closer fiscal integration (and agreeing upon things like retirement ages, pensions, insurance and a whole lot of other stuff).",1340456357

When I think of connections, I think of synapses or gap junctions -- the coupling of one neuron to others through a signaling mechanism.  Their tracers do the equivalent of segmentation of neurons, which doesn't give you the connections, just the morphology of neurons.  You left out what seems to be a key part of their method -- use of retrograde tracers that are taken up by axon terminals.  These retrograde tracers have to be injected into likely end points.  Seems like its an interesting technique for mapping a limited number of connections but useless for producing a comprehensive connectome due to required injection density.  Am I missing some aspect of this that allows generation of a connectome?<p>It's misleading to use the term ""wiring diagram for entire mouse brain"".  An engineer wouldn't consider it a wiring diagram if you stripped out a majority of the contact descriptions and just said there's a wire here, here, and here.",1340456228

I'm just concerned in that trying to downsize to save money, Nokia has missed the opportunity to take what was a profitable business (Trolltech's 2007 numbers (in NOK): 174m Rev, 46.5m Profit, 26.7% Net Profit Margin, 227 employees), and salvage it by spinning it back out into a separate business.<p>In dollar terms, Trolltech in 2007 was doing $30m Rev and making $8m profit. Obviously that's 5 years ago and I don't know what the current fundamentals are, but it would be interesting to know if that business within Nokia was doing more revenue or less, and what it's costs were.<p>If I were a former TrollTech employee, I would suggest taking a leaf out of Xamarin's book: <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2011/12/12/xamarin-mono/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigaom.com/2011/12/12/xamarin-mono/</a>",1340455991

Samsung is the only one making any profit, HTC is barely ekeing out one, LG, Sony, Motorola etc. are running in losses.<p>And bringing out an Android phone would cut off the $1B/yr lifeline platform support from Microsoft, which Nokia knew it would need in the painful transition. Nokia did approach Google for a similar deal, but Google told them to take a hike. Also, they're licensing maps etc. to Microsoft for a huge amount too.<p>Also, people seem to be ignoring that Nokia's signature cash cow feature phone business is collapsing because of ultracheap Chinese clones and white label phones being dumped into the market. Nokia trying to start their own ecosystem with QT would've been foolish in the face of entrenched competition.<p>I don't understand the notion that QT is some magical technology that's so much leaps and bounds ahead of other GUI APIs like iOS, Android, WinRT etc that developer would automatically flock to it. QT is definitely nice though.<p>In short, Nokia knew that they were going to go through extremely tough times for a couple of years regardless of what they pick, and they chose a partner with deep pockets($60B cash in the bank) rather than going solo.",1340455823

As far as we know what we want we should share the cost of producing it (i.e. production should be of what is known to be wanted, and cooperation should be on shared goals). And where we do <i>not</i> know (e.g. the future) we should not <i>prevent</i> unpredicted gains from what has been produced (i.e. by charging for copies).<p>The practical problem is how to get information and how to promote cooperation -- this is where possible arrangements can vary. But the core theoretical structure is that our production should follow from information, and our consumption should not be hostage to lack of information -- this is what all arrangements should try to achieve.",1340454007

Lowering Nokia's risk by doing an Android phone or two was a no-brainer. The smarter play was doubling down on Qt. Not just Symbian, Meego and the desktop - we know they could have added Android (demonstrated), iOS (community projects existed and still do) and Windows Phone.<p>And don't say Microsoft wouldn't allow it. Windows Phone was irrelevant and Nokia was Microsoft's few chances to change that. And more than that, Microsoft needed access to Nokia's patents (to keep up the pressure on Android, among other things). Nokia was in the driver's seat and could have written their terms. Instead, they let Microsoft effectively acquire them for peanuts. If Nokia had only kept their options open and jumped on what worked, today's mess was entirely preventable.",1340453515

Only lately it appears that we embraced 'diversity', where we respect the right of others to be, behave and think differently than our own ways, without feeling threatened by them or feeling the need to prosecute them.<p>Why is this happening only now and how can we make sure that we don't revert to the old ways? Part of it is history, I think - we're more aware now of the mistakes of the past, the world-wide wars, and the poverty effects of oppressive regimes. We also improved agriculture and technology to the point where most of us can have a decent living without stealing from others, conducting wars with our neighbors or by practicing slavery / communism. It might very well be the case of the famous saying, ""you cannot do democracy on an empty stomach"".<p>I only hope the trend will accelerate and that we'll be able to reap up the benefits of mutual respect and decency for human rights sooner rather than later.

Then, he got contacted by both Schrage and Zuck. So, does he edit his post or add a disclaimer to the top? Of course not! Only a journalist would check with the accused first, and only a journalist would correct the story in a meaningful way.<p>But Scoble is a blogger, so he adds the emails he got from FB to the end of the blog. And what is the net effect of this? It's two-fold:<p>1) many people will never get to the correction part<p>2) those who do will see resolute Scoble posting the rebuttal at the end, but that's just because he's an honorable blogger.. of course the gist of the story is right, or he would have changed it, right? Right? :(",1274659146

1373344,comment,1373076,1373147,0,0,earl,,,"Ditto.  Similar to tptacek's processbound argument, I'd be very concerned that you'd be dumped into an environment with very little supervision and flounder.  My experience at four startups has been that they really mean it when they say they need selfstarters and you tend to get very little direction as compared to bigger companies.  Instead, you're expected to jump in and find work yourself.<p>Also, if you are interested in startups, remember that virtually none of us use MS tech anywhere in our stack.  It's not a huge problem, but I generally prefer engineers that have put in a couple years somewhere else and aren't new to the LAMP/postgres/mysql/linux/java/ruby/rails environment.  All the way from the different dev tools to the ethos of source distribution and the skills you pick up around installing and configuring software from source.  As far as I remember, the MS stack generally seems to ship as binaries and have very little of the admittedly sometimes annoying issues that come with distributing software as source.  That's a problem for you because I expect engineers to be able to install software from yum / rpms and deal with more common link / library / configuration issues that come up.  Finally, it seems to me that MS typically has a blessed method of doing everything -- there is a preferred method to connect to MS SQL server, a preferred method of parsing xml, a preferred method of sending mail, etc.  The open source / linux tech stack is <i>nothing</i> like that -- there are always multiple ways of doing anything and it's often an unwritten part of the job description to help sort that out.<p>Finally, again specific to startups, I think you'll be shocked how different a 15 person company, or even a 100 person company, is to a 30K person company.  For instance, there will often be no review process, etc etc.<p>Depending on what exactly you've been doing at MSFT you should have some valuable experience, so don't be too pessimistic.

It's great for learning how to ship real software (large and small) with all of the attendant processes and politics that go with it. You will learn what you think is important to take with you and what is important to leave behind. Both types of learning are important, because as you move to startups, you will have a hand in determining the equivalents in your new microcosm of that world.<p>One interesting quality I see from many people who have worked there is that there is a perception that life after (i.e., outside of) Microsoft is scary. That's partly because you can change jobs there endlessly and never actually leave. You can go from working on operating systems to large binary (client) applications to Internet apps to video games, etc. I've had to assure several of my friends that were contemplating leaving that the water outside is safe and warm. Every one of them has thanked me afterwards.<p>Another poster made a good point about some companies' HR departments not taking a second look at you. That's true. However, I generally wouldn't want to work at those companies anyway. I've never had a problem finding work at great places. In fact, I've never had to apply for a job since I left.

The last thing is especially comical: The dev team would be behind schedule and the PMs would be very proud that they are macho enough to drop certain features in order to ship.

I mean, if your doing something new, and its practical that you have a limited amount of users, then a beta is great and make sense.<p>But most startups can't even generate the kind of buzz needed for a private beta, where it becomes worthwhile to build an invite/beta key system. If your product were to go public tomorrow, would your servers be killed in a traffic frenzy? If the answer is no, then you probably don't need a private beta.",1274655760

We develop a content library for the education market, and one of the most frequent questions we get is, ""How can I view the mobile version of this content from here."" Where ""here"" is the website loaded in a browser on a desktop/laptop computer. Our standard response was to use SMS or a third-party app. This solves that problem very gracefully.",1274655757

With very few exceptions, every time I've tried to recruit a Microsoft veteran to a startup, they've started to pull out the spreadsheets and given me complicated sob stories about how they can make $1m in the next three years if they stay at Microsoft, whereas I'm only offering them, eh, a few % of a hot startup.<p>The bottom line is that spending a lot of time at Microsoft could very well ruin you for startups.<p>Even though I did it that way, there are two different ways of thinking about your career, and if you're REALLY a startup person, you're not going to be hedging bets by serving out your 5 year Microsoft prison sentence. If you're telling yourself that as soon as you're fully vested you'll leave, you have failed to take into account the new incentives that Microsoft will put in front of you by the end of the fifth year. And eventually you're going to be stuck in the $300,000/year treadmill at a life-sucking anonymous job with no chance of ever hitting it big (or making an impact on the world).",1274655642

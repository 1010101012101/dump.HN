8456,comment,8145,8446,0,0,JMiao,,,"Advertising and PR will not be enough (and just saying these will solve your problem doesn't work either) -- Apple's ""Switch"" campaign is largely based around the fun, out-of-the-box experience and ease of use.  All of that work and they still have a way to go in converting people (especially non-college aged folk).<p>As far as distribution, a customized hardware solution that will deliver Parakey's software experience doesn't really address the distribution problem.  How do you get the mythical machines distribution themselves?  Besides, hardware is a very different business with different metrics than the software game...attacking both at the same time would be extremely difficult.<p>So my question still stands at how would you get the software out to the mainstream, especially those who aren't very web-literate to begin with?  I'm thinking about people like my parents who only use their browser to check Hotmail, read reviews, and maybe do some basic shopping.  They would certainly adopt a new computing platform that was more intuitive, but how do you get them to do this?  The same folks who would greatly benefit from Parakey's work is the same demographic that still uses Internet Explorer.",1175582347

For next to nothing, your expectations can be a ton lower and you'll still feel like you're getting some value. And if these free sites can actually beat out the established players in features and community, they'll basically be dead in the water, 'cause there's no price that beats nothing.<p>Then again, I heard that when Yahoo! started charging to get into their online dating service, they actually saw dramatic increases in membership due to the added ensurance of reputation a fee provides. <p>",1175580318

On the other hand, my grandmother (who recently passed away) went through late stage breast cancer in her mid-50s, lung cancer in her 60s, had a severe heart attack in her 70s and died in her 80s. It was so bad one time the doctors told us she would die in a matter of days. After she recuperated, she lived another 8 years. She was a tough bird.<p>How many times have we all heard: ""The doctors gave him 6 months to live and that was 5 years ago"". So if I knew I could go through 3-6 months of severe pain and get another 5-10 years of high quality life with my family, I'd probably do it. The problem is you may go through 3-6 months of severe pain and then die in month 7.<p>Right now being in my mid-30s and with a young daughter I enjoy, I'd take on the fight.

3314231,comment,3312502,3312502,2,0,Gustomaximus,,,"I've seen this outsourcing problem in a old role I had. For me there were 3 main problems;<p>- Not adequate training of these guys. I tried to convince the powers to send someone local over there for 6+ months to get these guys up to speed and ship shape but the management feeling was a good set of written instruction will do the job. Sorry, it wont for work roles of any complexity.<p>- Being remote and in different timezones created lags in turning work over that had to be looked at at both ends. Also they didn't all see the bigger picture or side issues which are important to help understand motivations and then create solutions and value ad in many project as they just had the main brief.<p>- Cultural differences with Indians I found is they don't like to say they don't know how to do something. I think this is a loss of face not to know or perhaps they are just worried about keeping their jobs. So often if you give them a project and they don't know how to do, they will do something else they do know how to do just to show you they were working. I kid you not... it was really frustrating finding out a week later they didn't know how to do a job so decided to make a new database instead because they could do that. It created problems a bunch of times.<p>Overall in my experience I found outsourcing is good for jobs where you have clear ""A,B,C,D"" instructions but for jobs that had to go from A - D and they figure out B and C, your better off keeping this locally. But that said I'm not adverse to outsourcing more complex work as these guys are generally smart and highly motivated. I think the problems I had could have been fixed by rotating local people in a reasonable ratio to the Indian group to keep culture aligned and maintain personal contact.",1323085958

Though they force you to use something that you'd normally consider ridiculous, like ^([a-zA-z0-9]){6,8}$, they also are much more quick about locking the login. On top of that you typically don't have to worry about SQLi with your bank and they do all use SSL. Phishing attacks are much more likely.<p>* I use LastPass and my typical password is a random 32-character alpha + numeric + all sorts of special chars string and different for every site. Some exceptions still apply: I want my main Google password to be something I remember and I feel all right about that since there I can use two-factor auth.<p>* LastPass knows your passwords. Or at least they could. Consider that when you log in to share your password with someone (see below for why), you can expose your password to yourself on their site. Now all they need is some JavaScript (potentially inserted by a malicious person from a third-party domain) to grab it out of the DOM.<p>* LastPass has the ability to share passwords with others. This works well in my situation where my wife has all of our banking and utilities passwords, and either one of use can pay the bills. Once again, the fact that every site gets a unique password means that I can share these without sharing the passwords to my employer's servers, etc. On the flip side, explaining how LastPass works to a non-geek was a challenge. Their plugin for Chrome is just sort of ugly and clunky (Chrome's fault).<p>* SSH agent is fantastic. I set up all my personal servers and workstations to only allow pubkey-based logins which means no more script kiddies trying random passwords. I also set up a PAM module to authenticate sudo using pubkeys and SSH agent, so I never enter a password into a remote machine.<p>* SSH agent forwarding may be set up in a very insecure way. The biggest problem is that if your local machine doesn't ask for permission to answer a pubkey challenge explicitly, you could have the following situation: an attacker compromised your remote machine. They have replaced /bin/bash with a clever script that executes bash, but also scans your ~/.bash_history for other hosts that you SSH'ed to. Now as soon as you log in, /bin/bash starts trying those hosts one by one, logging into those hosts and doing whatever the attacker wants since they also have access to sudo.<p>* Other things to be paranoid about: evil browsers, compromised operating systems, malicious browser plugins, key loggers, people with physical access to your machines, other people's dumb passwords on the same servers that you log into, MITM attacks and not checking the key signatures of SSH servers, monsoons, terrorist organizations, drug cartels, brain washing, swine flu and Soviet era doomsday devices.<p>Basically, LastPass and SSH agent are way better than using the same password, but just be careful about how you set it all up.",1323084952

School can kill ones's interest in pretty much everything, as soon as your curiosity gets replaced by tests, grades, homeworks, rote, memorizing etc. But it's a long topic, covered on HN many times.<p>For me, most of the school subjects were utterly meaningless. I didn't understand then why could I care about how we produce electricity, where are the resources located. I didn't see any use for learning about kings and battles of the centuries behind (the only date I really remembered back then, is the 6th of June 1944, Operation Overlord; Second World War at least seemed interesting to me personally). Or genetics. Or social things. Or entrepreneurship. Or whatever.<p>I don't miss the school per se. I only wish I put up with crap back then, I wouldn't have to learn some this stuff right now the second time.<p>I still believe the subjects, the way we're taught, are devoid of meaning. To pick one example, physics and geography classes contain enough of knowledge for people to make smart decisions about complex subjects, which scales up in democracies to nation-level. Instead, we see e.g. young mothers boycotting the construction of nuclear power plant in Poland, or whatever. Society seems to be unaware as of where do we get power from, how much do we need, and why it is a damn important problem. People only complain about gasoline prices going up; but hell, if the society doesn't care (or, doesn't even understand enough to be able to care) about energy, how can it expect politicians to care? It's a lack of mental picture of issues the world is dealing with. And energy is only one example.<p>I remember being taught all those things in school; I didn't really understand anything back then, and I think most of the people didn't. Things like ""renewable"" / ""not renewable"" resources were to me like Lisp symbols. Their only meaning for me was in tests, like: (member 'coal <i>renewable-resources</i>); get it wrong, have 0 points. Somehow, between grades, tests and homework, the real meaning of things we learn got lost.<p>Anyway, I wish to go once again through the school material, this time for real, and try to extract some meaning out of it for myself and others around me.",1323084730
3314177,comment,3313234,3313234,6,0,talaketu,,,"> Referential integrity implies a closed-world assumption where transactions on the database are serialized by (conceptually) suspending the world synchronously, applying the required changes, and resuming the world again when referential integrity has been restored successfully, rolling back any changes otherwise. Assuming a closed world is, we claim, both a strength and a weakness of the relational model. [...] The closed-world assumption, however, is in direct contradiction with distribution and scale-out. The bigger the world, the harder it is to keep closed.<p>This is the first time I have heard the expression ""Closed World Assumption"" used to refer to transactional atomicity.<p>For example, the Terry Halpin textbook ""Information Modeling and Relational Databases"" describes the CWA thus:<p>> When modeling a business domain, one may take different positions with respect to the completeness of the information captured in the model.   The Closed World Assumption (CWA) is the assumption that all relevant facts are known (i.e, appear in the model, either as asserted facts or derived facts) and that all the relevant business rules are known.)<p>I find this discrepancy in academic terminology difficult to reconcile.",1323084706

I wouldn't call it landline though, since it's actually a connection to the normal phone network which includes cell phones.

If you so desired, you could record your weight each morning by sending yourself an email and scheduling an Emacs function... But someone has probably already done that in the 35 years of Emacs' existence. If not, Emacs macros are very easy to write, because they emulate the actions you would take yourself. (See my 9 liner for incrementally searching for keyboard shortcuts: <a href=""https://github.com/aantn/castle/blob/master/home/.emacs.d/custom/personal/vim.el#L73"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/aantn/castle/blob/master/home/.emacs.d/cu...</a>)<p>* All org files are plain text<p>* All ""items"" in org files are part of a foldable hierarchy<p>* All items can be tagged<p>* TODOs are really just items whose headline starts with ""TODO"". Org-mode adds features for toggling, finding, and visualizing them<p>* You can extend org-mode any way you want. For example, I added a DEFER status for my TODO items.

Org-mode can parse them to build your daily agenda (<a href=""http://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html</a>)<p>* Org-mode displays formatting without hiding the markup (e.g. everything between two asterisks is bold)<p>* Org-mode exports to LaTeX, pdf, and html. (Embedded LaTeX is rendered too.)<p>* Org mode allows awesome links of all kinds (<a href=""http://orgmode.org/manual/Hyperlinks.html#Hyperlinks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orgmode.org/manual/Hyperlinks.html#Hyperlinks</a>)<p>* Code snippets can be embedded in org-mode and even executed<p>* Org-mode supports tables with formulas.

I really don't understand the purpose of the post.<p>What seems to be annoying most people here is that the comments could apply equally to men or women, yet the author assumes the issue is sexism without explaining why. By doing so, the author effectively dismisses the experience and opinions of men who have been in similar situations (based on the description) and believe the issue to have a different root cause. She's making the claim that this would never happen to a guy which is clearly directly contrary to the experience of many male readers, and it's unsurprising this is going to piss people off.<p>Note that I'm not disputing that the post MIGHT have represented a case of sexism, just that since the post doesn't explain how the author determined their position it's useless to myself and other readers.<p>Let's flip the question around: how do you know when your manager is being sexist and when they're just presenting their opinion, which is fair criticism?  The post appears to imply the answer is:  ""If the recipient of criticism is a woman, then it's sexism;  men never receive this kind of criticism.""  This is a bold claim, and if accepted, it's impossible to disprove because any attempt to disagree will see you labelled as sexist - which is the second source of frustration among people with a different opinion on this thread.",1323083013

Why do they do this? Coz someone somewhere needs to get workdone at cheaper cost, and 9 out of 10 times it cuts quality. Quality of code for the client and quality of hiring for the company.<p>The other major issues is culture. Indians push their kids to be Engineers and Doctors and kids do it even if they dont like it. more than half of my class of 2006 is no longer in the Software development fields coz they never liked it.<p>Edit:<p>Also you can get bad programmers everywhere , its just that India , due to the population has a large number of them which makes finding good people & companies very tough.",1323082863

Some of those even evolve or 180 over the course of a single career.<p>Speaking to your own concern, the tradeoff is that many technical managers are only there because they fell upward. They may understand your job responsibilities well based on their own experience, but they may not be good at advocating for their team or understanding how team members might have different needs and productivity then they themselves delivered. They also might loathe and stress excessively over their own job, which is no good for anybody. You can have a great manager that happens to be highly technical, but you may often find that you have a highly technical manager who&#x27;s an awful manager. So as you learn what they are, keep an open mind to the skills that are applicable to management itself --being a manager isn&#x27;t the same as being a technical lead.",1430546240

Unless you&#x27;re a true W2 mercenary, you should accept upside at a discount like tptacek&#x27;s hypothetical.<p>So the GP got burned in 2001? That&#x27;s a dumb reason to swear off all exposure to life-changing upside, forever, no matter what the expected return.<p>Unless you are a mercenary or shark who has to keep moving, think like a savvy investor first. <i>Then</i> indulge your preference for the type of work.  And only after all of that worry about the W2 money.<p>Successful companies will breed opportunity to do the kind of work you want.  Successful companies will also build your equity and increase your base rate to eventually catch up to market.  Growth will create professional opportunities.  Pick based on the prospects of the company first.<p>ITT people are too focused on the salary negotiations that patio11 brought up, and not enough on the aspects that build true wealth.  Don&#x27;t get trapped in local optimizations...you have to create exposure to outsized upside. If not through equity, then through side-projects and entrepreneurial activity.",1430546234

The finance sector damages the economy because it does not function as well as the models contend.<p>This is rather an understatement. Most neoclassical models (the dominant strain of economics, despite its demonstrated failure to predict crises) basically assume that the financial sector doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>This is why most economists&#x27; reaction was &quot;nobody could see it coming&quot; and their policy recommendation response to the crisis was &quot;<i>even</i> more of the same, please&quot; (deregulation, desupervision and de-facto decriminalization).<p>Then they wonder why people don&#x27;t respect them any more.<p>&quot;Hope&quot;, as such, does not come from the school of behavioral economics. That was getting trendy even before the crisis hit and did not help at all. Personally, I can think of only one economist who is making models that accurately model the behavior of financial institutions in the macro-economy - Steve Keen, who is resurrecting and extending upon Hyman Minsky&#x27;s instability hypothesis.",1430546140

I&#x27;ve had a few epiphanies on this myself in the past year or so:<p>1. &quot;New media&quot; actually is a pretty decent term. Much of tech -- pretty much most of it that concerns person-to-person exchange (as opposed as machine-to-machine systems controls and feedback) is effectively <i>media</i>. We should think of Facebook, Google, and Apple as largely media companies. Amazon straddles this line more with a focus on <i>commerce</i>, it&#x27;s also quite directly a media player through books and music.<p>2. Magazines were created in the 19th century as aggregators of short-form narrative (fiction and non) as a crossover between individual pamphlets and full-length books. Improved print and distribution mechanisms promoted their spread, and by the first quarter of the 20th century several major periodicals still surviving (somewhat) had emerged. In a sense a magazine was a large bundle you could buy for a single set price. The individual items might or might not <i>all</i> appeal, but many or most would. It was stepping back the purchase boundary from the individual piece to the collection.<p>3. One thing that&#x27;s happening now is that we&#x27;re both <i>disaggregating</i> individual periodicals, and <i>creating new aggregations</i> at a larger scale. Hacker News is one of many options for selecting individual items pulled from diverse publishers. The concept&#x27;s been around as long as there&#x27;ve been mailing lists and newsgroups -- comp.risks has cited various articles and news pieces since the mid-1980s. RSS syndication, Slashdot, Digg, and reddit, Facebook or G+ or Ello feeds, etc., all do much the same thing. What they <i>don&#x27;t</i> generally do is directly compensate authors.<p>We&#x27;re starting to see some changes in that regard, with Facebook apparently negotiating directly with publishers such as <i>The New York Times</i> to publish material directly to Facebook. I&#x27;m not sold (I don&#x27;t <i>do</i> FB), but it&#x27;s an interesting development.<p>I&#x27;ve been suggesting a broadband tax or similar automatic payment syndication scheme as a major, if not necessarily the only compensation model (see also Phil Hunt of Pirate Party UK and his broadband tax proposal). Google or major ISPs might also enter into this (or be forced to).<p>The negative on the future of Social is that social media networks seem to be awfully fragile and capritious. Facebook&#x27;s fall could well be as fast as Myspace&#x27;s was.",1430544268

With a high threshold (like t=67%) you get very rapid clumping as both reds and blues try to move into areas where they&#x27;re in the majority.  But with a low threshold (like t=25%) the few majority people who are isolated move, minorities quickly fill the open spots, and then the only remaining locations for minorities are completely surrounded by the majority (while no more majority members ever move).  So the minorities just shuffle around between a bunch of unacceptable locations, none of which give them the 2 minority neighbors they require.  Then there&#x27;s a sudden transition when t gets low enough, at around 16% -- the minority will tolerate having only one similar neighbor as long as there&#x27;s also an empty spot, and therefore they stabilize very quickly.<p>So when the threshold is high, there&#x27;s a lot of churn early but then stabilization.

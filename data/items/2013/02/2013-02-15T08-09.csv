I don't want to have to patch something in the middle of the night or lose everything. So I'm waiting for the next major release to see if they iron it out. In the mean time nodejs with express seems to be a decent use of the time.

I think ""rolling it into mathematics curriculum"" is the best way to make a large portion of students averse to it! In my country, we had a pretty advanced chunk of probability and statistics rolled into the math curriculum - it was a disaster, even the teachers tried to skip it because they thought it ate away precioud time that could be spent delving deeper into calculus (yeah, we had what you in the US would call ""college level calculus"" put into the high school curriculum but that's a different story...).<p>...now, for example, if those probability and stats courses would have been a different course or maybe some kind of ""workshop"", maybe someone else besides the ""math geeks"" would have gotten something useful out of them! Lots of high school kids hate math, but if you chip away chunks of it and present it as something else they tend to love it. On the other side, if you want them to <i>viscerally hate</i> something, teach it to them as part of ""math""!",1360918652

When someone is staring down death and you say ""hey, I bet this would help"", they're going to listen very, <i>very</i> intently, regardless of what a rational person might make of your suggestion.<p>At its extreme, this mentality can be actively harmful. I know of one person who does ""spiritual healing"" over the phone, charging a handsome fee to pump your telephone line full of good vibes. It may sound stupid (the cynic might even assume malice on the part of the giver-of-vibes), but things aren't so black and white when the chips are down.<p>[0] This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that crazy diets compromise your ability to enjoy life without delivering any discernible medical benefit.

5225215,comment,5223470,5223649,3,0,unconed,,,"Both C&C and PoP are about 20 years old. If you consider the copyright terms that most pirate parties are advocating, this IP would be in the public domain already. The PoP franchise is owned by Ubisoft now, so you really can't make the ""starving indie developer"" argument in either case.<p>There is such a thing as Fair Use, and it covers many educational purposes. I think it's absolutely fair to include 15-20 year old content under that. No reasonable person could think he's claiming he invented C&C or PoP, the point is obviously the engine. All he's done is make his tech demos more appealing by banking on people's nostalgia and using a real world example to demonstrate relevance. When a gaming site publishes a ""Top 50 Games from the 90s"" list, the article also cannot exist without wholesale lifting of other people's IP. The only difference is that they steal a little bit from a lot of people, rather than a lot from just one IP owner. When said IP owner is a giant faceless corporate entity that doesn't pay royalties to its artists, is there really a difference?<p>I've also never seen anything wrong with abandonware, because it feels like digital preservationism, a volunteer-run cultural library. Companies like LucasArts hoarded their licenses until platforms like iOS gave them an easy way to milk them for more money, again about 20 years later... There wasn't any more creativity involved than what this guy did, and it's very likely none of the people who worked on the originals saw a cent of that money. And let's not forget that it was the efforts of the abandonware community in creating SCUMMVM that made it easy to port these games to modern platforms in the first place.<p>Copyright exists to encourage and reward the creation of culture, not to protect profits no matter what.<p>Edit: Come to think of it, I think it's far more disrespectful for Ubisoft to make a new Prince of Persia game with the original title, than for someone else to create a way to play the original in a modern environment and get some exposure along the way.",1360918501

But people produce stuff on computers without coding all time.  They produce stuff on Photoshop.  They produce stuff on Excel.  They produce stuff on Wordpress.<p>It's becoming increasingly clear that economic growth and wage growth are becoming uncorrelated in the US.  For example, startups add billions and billions of dollars to the GDP of the US, but we'll never hire the millions of people that got laid off at steel factories over the past twenty years.<p>The economic model for the US this century is essentially one that consists of high-skilled knowledge workers, high-end manufacturing, and local service workers.  Everything else will be subject to economic factors outside of US control.  Lower-skilled manufacturing has had a revitalization in the US over the last couple years, but that's mostly due to things like China's currency appreciating, the price of oil remaining high, and a natural gas boom in the US.  If any of that changes, those jobs will go back to China.  Or Singapore, or Africa, or anywhere else where the supply of raw human capital is cheap.<p>If you view the future of the US economy in this lens, then everything Obama talks about makes sense.  For example, if this is the future, then the safety net programs we had in 1980 are inadequate in 2013.  Nobody really debated health insurance in the US in 1980, because over 80% of Americans already received health insurance from their employer.  Now it's barely two-thirds [0].  If you have a ""top-heavy"" skills distribution in the US, and your income is more strongly related to skills than ever, then you need a ""top-heavy"" tax code.  Or you could just let people bleed to death in their bathroom because they tried to pop their own thrombosed hemorrhoid (trust me, don't google it) because they couldn't afford a trip to the ER.<p>And to tie it back to the OP, it also means education for those high-skilled jobs will be the best way to ensure economic advancement.  It's no longer a sure thing to advance economically by putting in your time in at the plant and have your labor union negotiate a 5% raise for you every two years.  That doesn't need to mean everyone becomes a programmer.  We'll still have manufacturing jobs, but they'll require more than just punching the clock every day[1][2].<p>We've all probably worked with a self-taught programmer who was toiling away at some crappy job until they either got a degree or made enough web sites to convince a company to hire them.  And they probably tripled their income in the process.  So I see Obama's statement as saying we should streamline that process as much as we can, and orient our education system to produce as many high-skilled workers as possible.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/study-fewer-employers-are-offering-health-insurance/2012/04/24/gIQAfGH6eT_blog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/study-fewe...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/business/economy/02manufacturing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/business/economy/02manufac...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/magazine/skills-dont-pay-the-bills.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/magazine/skills-dont-pay-t...</a>",1360918131

If they switched to it it's unlikely to have happened without measuring a few different approaches and deciding this gave the best results overall. Unfortunately they have to deal with all of their customers apps, some of whom might have a huge variation in response time, which seems to trigger these issues - it's a complicated topic and one solution might not work for everyone.",1360915693

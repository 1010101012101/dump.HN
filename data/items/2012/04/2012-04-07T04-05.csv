Honestly this makes me want to play with Lisp (I do just about every other popular language but I've never done Lisp):<p>""The most powerful programming language is Lisp. If you don't know Lisp (or its variant, Scheme), you don't appreciate what a powerful language is. Once you learn Lisp you will see what is missing in most other languages.<p>When you start a Lisp system, it enters a read-eval-print loop. Most other languages have nothing comparable to read, nothing comparable to eval, and nothing comparable to print. What gaping deficiencies!<p>Lisp is no harder to understand than other languages. So if you have never learned to program, and you want to start, start with Lisp. If you learn to edit with Emacs, you can learn Lisp by writing editing commands for Emacs. You can use the Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp to learn with: it is free as in freedom, and you can order printed copies from the FSF.""",1333773704

I can say with some degree of confidence that current web standards kind of suck at both of these (I mean, they do an ""ok"" job, but could be far improved and simplified).  This is not entirely anyone's fault (obviously), but rather something inherent to standards.  Rather than design a fresh, sensible system, we have been using 20+ year-old standards because...they are the standard.<p>The first thing I would change?  The web is no longer just a series of documents, and needs to be treated like a networked application.  HTML and CSS should both die, and there should be only one language that dictates the behavior of a given web page (which can easily call other appropriately sandboxed languages).  There is a little bit too much black magic - everything should be transparent.  Really, the web browser should be the operating system, not the other way around.  Everything a web browser does is beginning to look like an OS (tabs are threaded applications, etc).

The intended usage of Rabin-Karp is to match a set of patterns against a text, in a more efficient manner than running Boyer-Moore or KMP on each individual pattern. An algorithm with a similar use-case to Rabin-Karp is the Aho-Corasick algorithm, which is very simple to learn if you know KMP already - the preprocess of the set of patterns is just a generalization of the preprocess of the pattern in KMP.",1333772260

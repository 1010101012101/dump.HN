8014556,comment,7996210,7998658,2,0,mhsiah,,,"I think your examples illustrate each of my first two points perfectly.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen such a long and laborious proof for the binomial theorem as that in the second example.  The two proofs are the same, of course (sometimes there exist several different ways to prove the same thing), the second is just way more explicit (also the first is missing equations 4.1 and 4.2, which are integrated into the second proof, making the first proof artificially shorter and artificially less comprehensible).<p>As to my second point, it seems pretty obvious to me that the goal of the second proof is to teach mathematical induction to people who are still struggling with basic arithmetic, not principally to prove the binomial theorem, since it includes weird things like putting &quot;inductive hypothesis&quot; and &quot;inductive conclusion&quot; in quotes, and he even writes in long hand that multiplication distributes over addition, i.e. that a(x+y) = ax + ay.  Until one has internalised these basic arithmetic operations <i>of course</i> you&#x27;re going to struggle with induction and the binomial theorem, and you&#x27;re going to prefer to have examples where everything is spelled out in detail. And that&#x27;s fine! But if you <i>have</i> internalised those details, making them explicit really does get in the way.  Really.  The core of the proof of the binomial theorem (which is to say, <i>the reason why it&#x27;s true</i>) is the first proof you gave; but the second proof completely obscures that behind a haze of mechanical arithmetic manipulation and pattern-matching.<p>So, if you find the second proof clearer and/or more appropriate (which is fine!), all that says is that <i>you</i> are &quot;in phase&quot; with that material, it does not necessarily make one better than the other or more appropriate than the other <i>in any other context or for anyone else</i>.  If students are having trouble with basic arithmetic manipulation, just don&#x27;t force them to learn harder stuff until that&#x27;s sorted out.  They have to be ready for it.  It is a good and happy thing that you have found material with which you are &quot;in phase&quot;; as I said last time, this is often very difficult.  Please stop blaming your difficulties on the material when the problem is that you&#x27;re using inappropriate material.  Thanks! :)",1404991619

Look at the warnings that have gone out about the last couple of Rails RCE vulnerabilities: attackers can scan the entire Internet for vulnerable apps in a faster time than many sysadmins can get the upgrade deployed.  Now, imagine this: a potential attacker, ahead of time, finds a way to reliably remotely fingerprint the version of Rails you&#x27;ve released as hyperledger.  One scan later, they&#x27;re sitting on a list of the IP addresses of some large proportion of hyperledger installs.  All they now need to do is wait for the right vulnerability to be announced (or find it themselves), and then it&#x27;s a race to gain control before a) the Rails team publishes a patch, b) <i>you</i> release a new version of hyperledger with the patch applied (or can announce that the patch doesn&#x27;t break things via a gem upgrade), c) more than 66% of the sysadmins jump on the announcement.  In the time for a), b) and c) to happen, they need to i) run a single exploit, and ii) simultaneously generate a bad transaction, across the servers they now control.<p>a), b), and c) are humans.  i) and ii) are a for loop in a single bash script.

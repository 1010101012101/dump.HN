Windows is for grandmas, like Macs used to be in the 90s."" <p>Having used gmail since March 28, 05, gcal since it came out, and other web software as appropriate for a while, I'm  a big believer in software-as-a-service because I hate the idea of having desktop software on one computer and not the other.  I also own both, an Apple PowerBook and a Dell laptop.  I find Windows a lot more keyboard friendly, since I like to fly around with both shortcut keys and the Mac just can't keep up with me.  On the other hand, I love Mac's Zen-like environment and the rock solid BSD underneath it -- Windows can seem pretty cheesy with all its pop-up baloons and MS-DOS prompt.  However, given the apps and hardware available for Windows, I still prefer Windows because I'm a developer and business guy.  I also disagree that Windows is for grandmas.  I mean, Paul, which world do you live in? Just because a niche of designers, developers and a few affluent folks use Apple, doesn't mean EVERYONE is using Macs.  Your bias clearly shows through here.<p>I personally am not biased to any particular hardware/OS because I use them all (even Ubuntu/Linux for servers).  Having worked with 5 flavors of Unix since 1991, I feel equally comfortable with the <i>nix world, Windows and Mac OS.<p>In the end, Apple is a cult -- it always has been.  Apple isn't any better of a company than Microsoft and neither is Google.  I've always had a love-hate relationship with Microsoft.  I hate how they try to break stuff (e.g. Java, JavaScript) but I absolutely don't mind using MS Office to get stuff done.  And, the fact that I almost entirely use open source for my development/deployment and not feel hampered on Windows combined with the fact that most of my personal information management is done using gmail/gcal, I can use Microsoft to get the best of all world: i.e. MS Office, web 2.0 apps through Firefox, anything open source (e.g. eclipse, rails, mysql), etc., etc.  I strongly believe OS will eventually become less relevant for desktops, whether it is Microsoft, Mac, or Linux.<p>In the end, consumers have personal preferences and corporation want to make money.  That's as simple as it gets. <p>On June 2, 2006 (thanks to gmail's quick search engine for locating the email/date), I sent an email to a bunch of folks pointing them to Paul's ""How to start a startup"" article (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html)"">http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html)</a> because I absolutely loved it!  On this article, I have to agree with the previous commenter that ""Paul Graham is the Ann Coulter of the Web 2.0 world."" :-(",1176093325

That's a very sick and twisted view of the world-- and it is from Karl Marx.<p>The reality is, you make money when you bring happiness to people.  You make people happy and they want to give you money they want to buy more of your products because they want to keep being made happy again, or made even more happy.<p>Thus, the happier you make your customers the more money you make.  <p>Further, making people happy, and making money are intrinsically <i>moral</i> things.   Trading with people is honest and moral.<p>Those who talk of <i>altruism</i> speak of violence. Altruism is the destruction of your self to benefit others. (Literally).  Thus socialists throw around the word ""altruism"" (and ""Sacrifice"" and a lot of other code words) to try and make it seem moral-- but at the root of it, what they are doing or advocating is putting a gun to your head and taking your money (and your money is just a representation of the labor you put in to earn it.)<p>So, don't you talk to me about morals-- when its clear you are advocating an immoral ideology.<p>The bottom line is this: Free people trade with each other and profit by trades that make people happy.  This trade is moral, it is honest, and it is right.  It is intrinsically peaceful.<p>Socialists oppose free trade, they believe in forcing people at gun point to ""trade"" on terms that the socialist approve of.  This is not peaceful, this is not moral, and obviously the people who are having their lives threatened are acting under duress--- duress is not compatible with happines.<p>So, the next time you hear ""sacrifice"" come out of the mouth of a politician -- realize its not <i>him</i> that will be sacrificing-- its <i>you</i> and he's putting a gun to your head to get richer.<p>That is the language of the thief and the looter, the socialist and the immoral. <p>This is so obvious that I shouldn't have to say it-- but its amazing how twisted people's minds get when they are subjected to socialist propaganda day in and day out.<p>To think you just said people doing things that make them happy, because they make them happy is immoral!<p> ",1176092572

10654,comment,10654,9770,0,0,carboncat,,,"I think you're thinking too much in sort of ""playground politics"" and not about capitalist systems. It doesn't matter who is afraid of who, or who the big mean kid is. Microsoft dominates the charts in the Amazon software bestsellers: google doesn't have anything in that list. What does that tell you? You're comparing apples and oranges. The ""IT industry"" is no longer a single industry, so it's no longer about getting a bigger slice of a single cake. 
When Microsoft does a major product launch that bombs (in the sense of Battleship Earth), then I'll take this proposition seriously. While they have chart topper after chart topper, there isn's a case.
I can see that your response to the ""well they sell lots of software"" argument is dismissive, but the fact that they do says a lot. It speaks to: market dominance due to historical monopoly; continued product development and support; and continued acceptance of Microsoft products by the marketplace. 
This might sound simplistic, but these are the hard, cold facts. It's fun to predict the demise of a giant (and exciting and controversial). It's boring to predict that they'll lumber on, giant-like, for years to come. That's not interesting or newsworthy!
But sometimes the boring predictions are the most likely ones to occur.

10653,comment,10653,9361,0,0,culix,,,"It seems like this guy is a big fan of the [Ben and Jerry's] (<a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000056.html)"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000056.html)</a> organic company model, and is deriding YC for being more of the ""amazon"" big burst type model (or at least accusing YC of creating small startup companies that follow the Amazon model). This analogy is slightly flawed, because, like ViaWeb, most of the startups that YC funds don't really seem like Amazon model companies. I would say that the author of this article is drawing the line between ""organic startup"" and ""explosive funded company"" much closer to the side of startups that start small, and including YC funded companies on the ""explosive funded"" side. That may account for some of his anger.<p>FWIW, his piece does have a good point: that a viable startup should be able to continue along a successful path even if they get rejected by YC. But as other people have noted there are benefits to being funded by YC: firstly they can [remove some of your distractions](<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=9439)"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=9439)</a> and give you good advice; and secondly, applying to and being rejected by YC might just [force you to step up and improve your company](<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=9486)."">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=9486).</a> While there certainly are (and should be) companies that don't need YC to become successful, I think if you can get ahead by getting funded, then you should do it, and that's why YC really matters.",1176091604

At that time, all our intranet servers and developer machines where dell/windows with a couple of linux machines only (CVS, build). Most people where using Office.<p>This year, we are starting a new venture. This time, all the developers run on Mac and all the servers are either hosted or running linux. All the presentations are make using Keynote, the intranet is a wiki (no more word) and some google spreadsheets. No one is using Office. The end result: we have not payed a single dollar to Microsoft.<p>Although big corporations are locked in, the trend is clear. MSFT is going to need a major turn around to get back on their feet.

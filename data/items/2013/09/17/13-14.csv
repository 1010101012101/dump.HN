Bacteria evolve based on environmental factors (like varying levels of antibiotics), and that&#x27;s eventually a very bad thing.<p>Viruses evolve as well, and the nasty viruses that we <i>could</i> eradicate entirely if we had good global vaccination coverage instead -- for a host of often-silly reasons -- get to explode in numbers in various outbreaks.<p>Even if a measles outbreak kills <i>no one</i>, it is still a huge increase in the amount of virus in the wild, and that means faster evolution.<p>I hate to imagine a parent who has been against vaccines (due to being duped by the anti-vaxxers) finding that their own local outbreak was the source for the super-measles virus, which isn&#x27;t reliably stopped by vaccines and spreads like wildfire, or is more deadly than current strains.",1379426384

6399266,comment,6398650,6398650,22,0,bhauer,,,"The point of the article that resonates with me is how frequently a technology that is poorly fit with a problem domain is selected because of conventional wisdom rather than data.<p>Related, it is remarkable how we developers routinely cite Knuth&#x27;s advice about premature optimization to justify our decision when the shoe fits, and then turn around and flatly ignore the advice when it doesn&#x27;t fit.<p>Selecting Hadoop before you have a specific and concrete need for it--or see that need approaching rapidly on the horizon--is in my experience often and surprisingly coupled with a disdain for other performance characteristics (because Knuth!).  The developers prematurely selecting Hadoop as their data management platform will routinely be the same developers who believe it&#x27;s reasonable for a web application with modest functionality to require dozens of application nodes to service concurrent request load measured in the mere thousands.  The sad thing here being that application platforms and frameworks are not all that dissimilar; today, selecting something with higher performance in the application tier is relatively low-friction from a learning and effort perspective.  But it&#x27;s often not done.  Meanwhile, selecting Hadoop on the data tier is a substantially different paradigm versus the alternative (as the article points out), so you have some debt incoming once you make that decision.  And yet, this is done often enough for many of us to recognize the problem.<p>In my experience, for a modest web application, it&#x27;s better to focus resources and effort on avoiding common and stupid mistakes that lead to performance and scale pain.  Selecting Hadoop too early doesn&#x27;t really do a whole lot to move the performance needle for a modest web application.<p>Trouble is, many web businesses are blind to the fact that they are a modest concern and not the next Facebook.",1379426381

Master-slave replication is pretty damn bulletproof these days, and multi-master isn&#x27;t as terrible as it was even a few years ago.<p>* Working set: All servers can have the entire working set. Additionally, features like foreign data wrappers in postgresql and federated tables in mysql mean that you can query your sharded databases, and still get aggregate results back.<p>* Data growth: SQL servers were Big Data before Big Data was cool. Terabyte storage clusters are no problem for an SQL database engine, with some entities having clusters in the petabyte range.<p>Databases are a very fast moving target of late, with competition from many fronts meaning that what was true even last year may not be true today. Additionally, with things like Postgresql&#x27;s foreign data wrappers, you can choose the best data processing engine for the job -- keep the data on the databases for the nice bits of SQL, but still be able to throw it towards a hadoop cluster at a whim if needed. Using the right tool for the job is important, and equally important is keeping up with what tools are out there, because this is a rapidly evolving area of tech, and analyzing each job separately, instead of relying on any mantra, is what&#x27;s needed to keep one flexible to keep up.",1379426322

And there are always places like the East Bay and the Peninsula to capture some of the demand. But it&#x27;s not as if the Peninsula is cheap these days, so Oakland seems the more likely candidate to take on the burden (which then raises a thorny question of where all the low-income Oaklanders go when the gentrification accelerates).<p>But it&#x27;s conceivable that SF basically becomes the Mahattan of the Bay Area, a playground for the rich, while everyone else gets pushed into the outlying boroughs and beyond.

Also: while mortgages and interest rates are great indicators for the housing market in general, SF seems to have an unusually large supply of cash buyers.<p>In conclusion: I&#x27;m not disagreeing with the article, nor am I bullish on the local housing market. I don&#x27;t fully understand why it&#x27;s behaving the way it is, and that&#x27;s never a great sign. But superficially, it seems to be the sort of &quot;microclimate&quot; that doesn&#x27;t track the aggregate US market very closely. How many of these enclaves of wealth does the US have, or will it have, that seem to have a low to zero beta w/r/t the overall market? And if it&#x27;s a significant amount, when will speaking in aggregate terms start to lose a bit of meaning?<p>On a related note, I&#x27;d love to see a comparison of urban vs. rural vs. suburban areas across the US. I suspect that concentrated urban centers are obeying very different laws of physics, so to speak, than suburbs and semi-rurals with their huge tracts of overbuilt housing inventory. Example: I used to live in LA, and when the press spoke about how hard-hit LA was during the housing crash, they painted with a pretty big and sloppy brush. The <i>surrounding</i> areas (Inland Empire, etc.) got the plague, but housing in LA proper barely registered a slight cough.",1379425839

If a &quot;diagnosis&quot; appears in the DSM, then it&#x27;s official -- schoolchildren can be assigned the diagnosis without the cooperation of the child or his parents, which allows the school to demand additional funds from governments, allows parents an get Social Security payments based on the diagnosis -- basically, the floodgates open up. The child is taken out of the equation, because it&#x27;s an official diagnosis -- it&#x27;s in the DSM, the &quot;Bible&quot; of psychiatry and psychology.<p>If the reasoning was that it allowed people to volunteer for treatment, there would be no need for a DSM, because people who volunteer for treatment don&#x27;t need a diagnosis -- their willingness to undergo treatment is more than enough justification.<p>The DSM&#x27;s purpose is to legitimize diagnoses, make them part of the canon of recognized mental illnesses, require insurance companies to pay for treatments, require the Social Security system to pay up. Unfortunately, because of these pressures, the DSM now includes absurd things like grieving at the passing of a loved one, sibling rivalry, the inability to add a column of figures, and so forth -- obvious abuses of the imagined authority of the field of psychology.<p>> Lots of things are normal in small quantities and pathological in large quantities.<p>True about some things, but that&#x27;s not how medical diseases are defined. One either has measles, or does not have measles. One either has cancer, or does not have canter. One is either pregnant, or is not pregnant. And more importantly, in each of these cases, a doctor can go beyond observing symptoms, and measure a cause.<p>Not so for mental illnesses -- their diagnosis relies only on symptoms, the causes are unknown (that&#x27;s the business of neuroscience, not psychology). This is obviously a basis for abuse and exploitation. The DSM covers a spectrum from very serious conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar syndrome, both of which are actually biological conditions with mental symptoms, to any number of make-believe diseases, some of which appear and disappear from the canon over time, based on public gullibility and taste, for example Asperger&#x27;s and homosexuality, both of which have entered, and then left, the DSM based on public pressure and politics, not anything resembling science. The DSM only lists symptoms, not causes, not science, and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so often abused.<p>> ... there&#x27;s a label they can put on it.<p>Yes, and that was a perfect way to put it. Psychology depends on labels, medicine depends on objective causes. Because psychiatry and psychology rely on the assignment of labels based on observation of symptoms, it&#x27;s not science and it&#x27;s not effective.<p>This is why the director of the NIMH has recently decided to drop support for the DSM, a decision that is not less than earthshaking in the mental health field. The director&#x27;s reason? The DSM is based only on the observation of symptoms, and it lacks validity. For science, society is now moving in a completely different direction -- away from mind research, toward brain research.<p>More here: <a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>And here (a video that makes the same points): <a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/updates/2013/mental-disorders-as-brain-disorders-thomas-insel-at-tedxcaltech.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/updates/2013/mental-disorders-...</a>",1379425571

I bought most properties as short sales and a cash buyer seemed to have an advantage (maybe I was wrong?) so I always offered cash.  I always had to put out a few bids at a time since even the most promising bids seemed to have a ~25% success rate.<p>To buy at least one every year I had to take out a low interest HELOC on the first investment purchase to help finance the new ones.  Thankfully I was able to pay the prior HELOC amount back in full prior to buying a new one and just keep using the same credit line since there&#x27;s a 5-year draw period.<p>I live and buy here in southern CA so the prices have risen to the point where I don&#x27;t feel comfortable buying anymore, but thankfully so have the property values of the homes I do own.<p>I never looked into getting my real estate license, but we have a great agent now who we&#x27;ve bought our last four homes through (including the one we live in).  She also recommended an excellent property manager that we now use exclusively (our last one was worthless).  A good property manager makes all the difference.  I actually spend more time sorting the taxes for the properties than I spend doing anything else for them, and that&#x27;s one a couple hours a year.<p>I think real estate is a great industry for hackers.  I&#x27;ve always been good with money, but I had no background in real estate when I started.  I could have done a lot of things better and I probably got lucky, but it&#x27;s still a goo industry for us.<p>Investing in equities is too information-centric and it&#x27;s hard to compete or gain a legal competitive advantage.  But in real estate the market is so fragmented, varies by region, and realtors are so old-fashioned that it&#x27;s easy to gain an advantage if you think differently.<p>I suspect that anyone who can run a startup as a single founder (i.e. they have a wide range of skills) could dominate the real estate market in most non-major cities within five years if they wanted to.  If they document and systematize their process, realtors would pay tens of thousands for it a pop.  Real estate agents tend to always be looking for shortcuts, are unfazed by loud and spammy advertisements, and want new quick ways to get leads than most other markets and have a lot of money to spend doing it, especially here in southern California where a commission can be over $100,000.<p>If I weren&#x27;t set on running my company for the next 10+ years I&#x27;d probably go into real estate to see if I could do what I suggested above.  Anyway, a few closing tips: find a good lender if you borrow, find a reliable and reputable inspector before you decide, thoroughly research the area (historical prices, industry, jobs, schools, crime, future major builds plans, etc.), and condos are easier to manage than single family homes since the HOA covers everything, plus your margins are higher.",1379425307

I&#x27;ve spent the last 10+ years exclusively in very large HPC environments where the average size of the problem set is somewhere between 500TB and 10PB, and usually much closer to the latter than the former.<p>I think that, for the types of problems Chris mentions, for small data sets, hadoop is as silly a solution as he claims, and for the large map-reduce problem set of the (divide and conquer using simple arithmetic) of 5TB+, he&#x27;s clearly in the right. Periodically I peruse job postings to see what is out there, and I&#x27;m personally ashamed at what many people call &quot;big data&quot;, but just because your problem set doesn&#x27;t fit the traditional model of big data (incidentally, I&#x27;m having trouble thinking of a canonical example of big data. perhaps genome sequencing? astronomical survey data?), doesn&#x27;t mean that a) hadoop is not the right solution, and b) it&#x27;s best done on a box with a hard drive and a postgres install, pandas/scipy, whatever.<p>We&#x27;ll be generous and say that 4TB can do 150MB/s. A single run through the data at maximum efficiency will cost you ~8 hours. Since we&#x27;ve restricted ourselves to a single box, we&#x27;re also not going to be able to keep the data in memory for subsequent calculations/simulations/whatever.<p>Take for example a 4TB data set. It is defined such that it would fit on a 4TB hard drive, but if your problem set involves reading the entire set of data and not just the indexes of a well-ordered schema, you&#x27;re still going to have a bad time if you want it done quickly, or have a parameterization model that requires each permutation to be applied through the entire sequence of the data rather than chunks you can properly load into memory and then move on, you&#x27;re going to have a really bad time.<p>I suppose all of this is to say that the amount of required parallelization of a problem isn&#x27;t necessarily related to the size of the problem set as is mentioned most in the article, but also the inherent CPU and IO characteristics of the problem. Some small problems are great for large-scale map-reduce clusters, some huge problems are horrible for even bigger-scale map-reduce clusters (think fluid dynamics or something that requires each subdivision of the problem space to communicate with its neighbors).<p>I&#x27;ve had a quote printed on my door for years: Supercomputers are an expensive tool for turning CPU-bound problems into IO-bound problems.",1379424547

It&#x27;s meant to convey a powerful heat source to the reader, but as another reader pointed out, a strong focused light source on a bit of well-insulated black material might be able to raise it to several thousand degrees; the same source pointed at a well-polished mirror could leave it cold to the touch. In other words, the &quot;10,000&quot; degree figure tells us nothing useful.<p>> (from the allegedly supporting New Scientist article cited on the talk page): The first thing Lewis and his colleagues did was fire powerful laser pulses at the material.<p>What person with scientific training would set up a laser to conduct his first test on an unknown material? I admit to not being a professional NASA egghead, but if confronted with a substance alleged to be highly heat resistant, I&#x27;d start off by holding a sample of it into a Bunsen burner flame, or better yet pop it into a crucible and into a high-temperature furnace.<p>If a temperature of 10,000C had really been achieved, that would have been quite impressive: according to elswhere in Wikipedia, the &quot;best&quot; known heat-resistant ceramics lose stability around 3,000C.<p>This Tech Radar article <a href=""http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/future-tech/10-mindblowing-uses-for-the-world-changing-substance-that-never-was-1156955"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/future-tech/10-m...</a> claims a more modest 2500, achieved with a blowtorch and not a laser. What are we to believe?<p>As a (hypothetical) egghead, I would certainly object on moral grounds to using an egg for a scientific test of heat resistance. I would instead strive to measure the two characteristics actually relevant to heat resistance, namely thermal conductivity and thermally induced ablation.<p>As an amateur scientist completely unprepared for such a test and working out of an ordinary household, I would have urged the inventor to use his amazing compound to coat not a chicken&#x27;s egg but the tip of a thermometer. And I would have attacked this assembly not with a laser but with a burning match. And I would have reported on how much of a rise in temperature was observed, and in which time.<p>Certainly no non-crackpot scientist would subject his or anyone&#x27;s hand to a blowtorching without considerably more convincing previous tests. But maybe that claim about the human hand was just rhetoric - it&#x27;s hard to tell.<p>Later in the supporting article, the claim is toned down to a much more modest 1000C. Still, there&#x27;s a fundamental problem here with the basic chemistry:<p>Plastics, or more formally polymers, are organic compounds, chemically held together by covalent bonds. Because of the physics that underlies chemistry, covalent bonds cannot be as heat-resistant as ionic bonds (as found in salts and other inorganic compounds). All-organic diamond is the hardest substance known to man (I think) but burns at relatively low temperatures. High-temperature plastics break down at around 150C.<p>If the compound contained a mix of polymers, as stated, then it contained some organic compounds with known low melting/burning points. Mixing several such compounds doesn&#x27;t make any of them more heat resistant; their chemical properties (including heat resistance) would not be changed unless you&#x27;d created new and different compounds that would then _not_ be polymers. Similarly, mixing in about 10% ceramics might change the compound&#x27;s mechanical properties, and polymer-ceramic composites are indeed useful materials for this reason, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that part of the mix is low-melting, burning, smoking plastic.<p>I&#x27;m sorely tempted to pick a fight on the Wikipedia Talk page as well, where the most ardent defender of the Starlite story lambastes skeptical commenters as &quot;bigoted&quot; and &quot;ignorant.&quot;",1379423978

I&#x27;m a bit disheartened every time I get yet another vote for those answers.<p>Anyway, what I was going to say was that I get the impression that when I ask or answer a question from that account (with several thousand points and active for 5 years), I&#x27;m treated differently than people on new accounts with few points, even when their question is worded exactly the same way I&#x27;d do it. It feels like bullying by low-quality users who through grinding stumbled upon editing powers. It certainly (mostly) stopped me from contributing a year or 2 ago; not even so much for the morality of it, but more the overall idea that a site run by the distinctly mediocre (even if there are a few very high quality contributors) just doesn&#x27;t give me great confidence in the quality of what is on there.<p>Of course this is a widely documented phenomenon with any UGC (hey there&#x27;s a buzzword we haven&#x27;t heard since 2009!) site after it hits a certain critical mass, we just have to look at the very site we&#x27;re reading now...",1379423399

There are simply people who&#x27;ve trained in behavioral patterns that avoid triggering certain impulses, often by introducing a constant background level of discomfort (look at the number of suicides for recovered alcoholics versus general population, the number of suicides is WAY higher for recovering drug addicts even compared to recovering alcoholics).",1379423011

They hit on a &quot;let the mountain come to Mohammed&quot; insight that helped them get past that problem, so that they could do their ETL jobs in less time and ultimately keep their workhorse databases (e.g., web search indexes) better-fed.<p>Simultaneously, a whole lot of people who were not having the same problems, but who want to believe that they are like companies who have those problems (because who doesn&#x27;t want to be Google?) started also running into problems with handling large amounts of data.  Unfortunately, the most popular mistake in applying Feynman&#x27;s Algorithm[1] is to skip the first step.  Rather than investigating their problems and recognizing that the issue was poor tooling or inefficient implementations and they weren&#x27;t actually coming anywhere close to any true limits of the kind that the companies that came up with Big Data were trying to get around, they instead just went, &quot;Hey, X company that we look up to is also having problems that look cosmetically similar to ours, and they use Y technology - let&#x27;s give that a try!&quot; and proceeded to dive straight into constructing bamboo control towers and coconut radios without ever looking back.<p>After that, well, I think it&#x27;s a tragedy of mostly-rational behavior.

Poor salaries (when gov. pay something) which obligates them in working on two or three part-time jobs, no gratitude (the phone card, the BINA system, which government didn&#x27;t helped the inventor on recognizing the patent) and so on. That&#x27;s why a researcher/cientist stays no more than 2 or 3 years in Brazil after graduation or research publishing.",1379422917

Constructors should validate what is passed into them and fail if that is invalid. The alternative is to construct a zombie object that can&#x27;t actually be used. Objects like this subvert the type system and lead to lots of unnecessary &quot;if object.is_valid()&quot; checks all over code that uses them.",1379422854

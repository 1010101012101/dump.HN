When I wrote about Gloria Mark's finding on working spheres ( <a href=""http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2006/07/designing-collaborative-task-manager.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2006/07/designing-collabora...</a> ) I was surprised of that finding as it would seem counterproductive to the need to having to load up the ""code"" in the brain's RAM. Another explanation is that what she described is a typical cubicle/large organization workflow that would be counterproduictive to the Hacker's brain (replace hacker by researcher and you have the same symptoms).<p>Igor.

Nevertheless these cos invariably started out small by solving one significant problem in a great way while overlooking all those other dimensions.
In short, try to evaluate whether the extra information is truly a significant part of the core problem you set out to solve. If it isn't, postpone the solution. If you succeed based on your core solution you can worry about it later, when you'll have plenty of time and money to do so.",1187943926

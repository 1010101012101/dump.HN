It&#x27;s actually far harder to legally bribe politicians today than it was eg 100 years ago. A century ago there were hardly any laws restricting such practices.<p>What has changed in that time, is now the government has vast economic controls at its disposal. If the government doesn&#x27;t control the economy, you can&#x27;t buy economic favors from them. When the US was still a very Capitalist nation at the start of the 20th century, in which the government had little control over the economy, political bribery would not get you very far when it comes to passing laws for your own profit.<p>To sum it up: political bribery is far more difficult today than it was 100 years ago, but now it can buy you <i>a lot</i> of things whereas before it could not, because of the substantial expansion of government control over the economy.<p>When it comes to the financial crisis, Western Europe committed many of the same financial &#x27;crimes&#x27; you&#x27;re referring to that, that the US did. The financial, banking and real estate boom and bust hit countries from Britain to France to Germany to Spain. What happened in the US was not unique to the US, the same things were going on in a lot of &#x27;first world&#x27; nations.<p>The Fed stepped in and bailed out tons of European banks for example, the same as they did US banks.",1431500303

9537251,comment,9537121,9537121,0,0,derefr,,,"> Technical and human pluralism enriches the world. Monocultures do not.<p>Unlike human culture, tech cultures can&#x27;t communicate to enrich one-another. (The people <i>in them</i> can, but this is a different thing.)<p>To explain what I mean: you can&#x27;t import a Ruby library into a Python program. You <i>can</i> import a C library in a Rust program, or vice-versa—but that&#x27;s a special case. Even then, you can&#x27;t <i>write a patch for</i> a C library in Rust, or vice-versa, because the original maintainers of the library you want to contribute to are only going to accept contributions in languages they understand and can maintain directly.<p>I really believe that fixing this—decoupling &quot;runtime/platform&quot; from &quot;language semantics&quot;, and &quot;language semantics&quot; from &quot;syntax&quot;—is the single most important thing that will happen in software engineering in the next 20 years.<p>Imagine a program somewhat like go-fmt(1), that would run on checkout of a source repo, to transform a base-level AST into the syntactic representation of your choice, and pattern-match-decompile any low-level statements with high-level &quot;shape&quot; into the macro-statements in your chosen language that would generate them[1]. Imagine every library being not only available in every language, but able to be contributed to by programmers who know any language. Etc.<p>The result would be, in one sense, a &quot;monoculture&quot;—a single ecosystem of libraries, rather than 12 ecosystems between the CRT, the JVM, the CLR, the Erlang VM, etc. But it wouldn&#x27;t disallow competition between versions of said libraries—just allow obvious winners to win once-and-for-all, instead of limiting their success to their technological &quot;country of citizenship.&quot;<p>---<p>[1] Or, better yet, a FUSE server where an underlying directory of AST files gets mounted as syntaxified files. Much cleaner from the rest of the toolchain&#x27;s perspective.",1431500161

It&#x27;s not future proof because you don&#x27;t know on which OS and file system you&#x27;ll need to run, maybe some limited embedded device.<p>Ruby&#x27;s rvm solved that problem with a single directory level and a gem@version naming scheme.",1431500113

9537247,comment,9533211,9535755,0,0,tilsammans,,,"People all over the country are routinely treated with heroin (diamorphine) in a clinical setting. It is a very useful narcotic. If you&#x27;ve had nose surgery, even a simple corrective procedure, you&#x27;ve been treated with cocaine. None of these people leave the hospital craving drugs and looking to score. They do not become addicted.<p>Addiction does not follow from treatment with narcotics. What you think of as harmful addiction follows from the junkie subculture created by criminalization<p>The harmful effects of drug addiction are in fact a result of severe criminalization of narcotics. If you suffer from debilitating pain, you will go out of your way to suppress it. If no one will sell you pain killers legally, you will get them illegally.<p>Indeed, if doctors could legally prescribe opiates for chronic pain sufferers, most of the illegal market would disappear. There would indeed be no crime. People in pain would get their medication for a few dollars and go on having normal lives. Calling these people addicts really is a way of ostracizing them, which only hurts people. True, they might be addicted to their medication. Their pain is now manageable too, really a fair trade off I think. Even more so when a daily dose costs just pennies.",1431500110

That could be huge.<p>And aside from that, numbers build legitimacy. If a third party is obviously not going to win, but gets 10% of the vote, we start taking it seriously, and it can build on that success over multiple elections, just like individual candidates do.<p>The &#x27;wasted vote&#x27; trope assumes that the sole point of a vote is to elect a candidate. Your vote is also an act of free speech - it can send a message to your fellow citizens and your government.

The Transparency International page you link to is the <i>perception</i> index.<p>It measures what a set of people <i>perceives corruption to be like</i> in each country, and composits results from a number of different surveys in a way that as far as I know is not benchmarked against other data to verify if survey results actually matches reality.<p>You can not use it as a measure of how corrupt a country actually is. It&#x27;s likely that it&#x27;s an indicator when the numbers are very far apart, or that it can be used to spot trends in a country over time, but the relatively small difference between France and the US seems unlikely to be sufficient to draw any conclusions.",1431500000

Sounds like advice that&#x27;s only applicable if you&#x27;re dealing with very reputable top-tear investors.<p>My experience: Giving investors substantial control doesn&#x27;t just give them an ability, it gives them a liability to their LPs. If something goes wrong in the startup, and everyone knows that the board members could have potentially taken drastic steps such as firing the founders to possibly prevent the bad situation, even if the possibility is very small, then that responsibility weighs heavily on the VCs. Giving them substantial control, gives them a big responsibility to fix problems and only a loaded gun with which to fix them.<p>Just a guess, Sam&#x27;s advice seems like a classic type of VC advice - do riskier things, because although it will likely end up bad for you individually, we&#x27;re well diversified and it increases expected value for our VC portfolio as a whole. Suppose that&#x27;s a big part of the reason why he&#x27;s the spokesman for YC now.<p>> Finally, board members stick with the company when things really go wrong, in a way that advisors usually don’t.<p>Nice choice of wording, they stick with the &quot;company&quot;.<p>> As a side note, bad board members are disastrous.

Team A is all the people who were still working hard on a fix right up until the end.  Team B is all the people who gave up, or merely looked on with concerned expressions instead of being helpful.<p>You listen to the people on Team A. Even the people who were part of the problem in the first place (unless there&#x27;s a pattern of &quot;Test it in Production&quot;).  Why?  Because Team A is living with the consequences of the bad decisions.   The people on Team B get to raise concerns, offer suggestions, and disagree, but they&#x27;re really spectators.<p>The people who are on Team B -and- who are involved in the problems are the people you really have to watch out for.  They have poor judgement and don&#x27;t clean up after their own messes.  Honestly these people should be on performance review, but for reasons I&#x27;ll never fathom we always seem to forget these indiscretions at annual review time.  I honestly wish I knew why.

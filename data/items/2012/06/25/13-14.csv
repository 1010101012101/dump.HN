If you want to understand this better, please read our description of the CAP theorem (<a href=""http://hyperdex.org/extras/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyperdex.org/extras/</a>).  As formulated by Gilbert and Lynch, the CAP theorem really says, ""If you must always read the latest value, and you must have any server serve any request, and clients are collocated with servers, then you cannot survive a partition.""  This is in the same class as, ""If you separate all clients from servers, the clients cannot contact the servers.""<p>If, instead, you make assumptions about what kind of failures are actually possible, then you can do more.  HyperDex assumes that if you have less than f nodes fail at any give point in time.  A failure could be the process crashing, the machine being turned off, or a partition occurring within the datacenter.  So long as this assumption is true, then HyperDex is able to survive the partition, make progress (remain available), and provide strong consistency while doing so.<p>By making additional assumptions, we are able to make additional guarantees.  This is not unlike what other engineers do (warning: massive simplification).  A engineer building a bridge can assume the bridge can hold only so many cars and that each car has an upper bound on its weight.  The product of these gives the entire weight the bridge must withstand.  If the engineer builds the bridge to withstand the expected weight, plus some extra, then the bridge will work in all anticipated scenarios.  It will not, of course, withstand bumper-to-bumper traffic consisting of 18-wheelers filled with lead bricks.  But again, it doesn't have to.",1340632016

It would be pointless. Their real competitor is Windows, and they should be using marketing and partnerships with manufacturers (Dell and others) and big app developers (EA, Valve, etc) and whatever is necessary to push Ubuntu/Linux more into the mainstream.<p>If this is indeed their plan, though, there is a pretty big flaw in it. Why are they trying so much to get ""inspired"" by Mac OS, when they should be trying to get inspired by Windows, and make it easy for the many more Windows users to transition easily from Windows to Ubuntu? As a Windows user, this is why I find Linux Mint Cinnamon (also based on Ubuntu) so much easier and less frustrating to use than regular Ubuntu. Of course Windows 8 is completely changing the direction for their UI/UX from the ""old Windows"" style, too, so there's that, but I have no reason to believe it will be successful, yet.",1340631920

Somehow at least 99.5% of that time has been spent in the fogs before enquiry and only the last 0.5% have we really seen the explosion of mathematics, the emergence of science, and the industrial revolution.

4156381,comment,4155124,4155501,1,0,rbehrends,,,"The situation is a bit more complicated than that.<p>To begin with, there are basically three CLR backends with sufficient maturity: Microsoft.NET, Mono, and Mono/LLVM, of which Mono is probably the slowest, because it is optimized for fast startup; that is matched against java -server, which (unlike -client) does extra optimizations (like mono --llvm) at the expense of a slower startup time. This works for short benchmarks, because compilation time is fairly minimal for these tight-inner-loop benchmarks.<p>Second, none of these benchmarks really touch on any of the JVM's weak spots. The classical example here is complex number arithmetic, where even an addition can potentially trigger a heap allocation (the JVM escape analysis only helps as long as functions don't actually store results anywhere). There are unfortunately quite a few such features where you get extra overhead to implement the workarounds.<p>Third, the JVM tends to be a bit of a memory guzzler. Combined with java -server's fixed-size heap, that can create problems in some scenarios (such as a system process that forks a few instances of itself).<p>In the end, few people will pick one or the other for the raw performance (which, in the end, is not very far apart), but for the ecosystem that comes with each backend.<p>It is worth noting that there are also other VM-related concerns, and overall, the CLR has the superior design as a general-purpose language backend.<p>For example, CLR functionality is a superset of JVM functionality. That makes the CLR far more pleasant to use as a compiler backend than the JVM (the reason why JVM-based languages use the JVM primarily is probably to hook into the JVM ecosystem, not because they love devising workarounds to implement closures or value types somewhat efficiently).<p>Similarly, P/Invoke is in practically all aspects superior to JNI. If you need to call native code a lot, P/Invoke is almost always the easier way to do it.<p>Library versioning is another issue where the CLR has the better story.<p>Again, what will almost certainly drive the use of one or the other for 99% of all programmers is what infrastructure (frameworks, libraries) they need. If they want to develop web applications using Scala/Lift, the JVM it is. If you want to implement games using Unity, you're going to use the CLR. The benefits you get from reusing code will almost certainly dwarf other concerns.",1340631002

Where the measure of optimality is choosen by some mechanism, e.g. some form of democracy or so, outside of the scope of my suggestion.<p>If you actually want to have a high carbon-future, you might even opt for a negative tax, i.e. subsidy.  The `proceeds' that get divided equally would turn into costs.  If you want no interference, you set the tax to zero and forget about it.<p>> What if I think that the tax is too high?<p>For the average CO_2 emitting person the level of the tax doesn't matter, since the scheme's designed to be cash-flow neutral for them.  But with a tax that's too high you would get less CO_2 emissions than your society would agree on as optimal.  With a tax that's too low, you'd get more total emissions than people would agree on.

If the benchmark is flawed, help us fix it.<p>Here are some ways it could be flawed:<p>* MongoDB and Cassandra were set to default consistency levels.  They are not configured to wait for the majority of replicas to respond.  HyperDex waits until data is committed at all replicas.  This clearly biases the benchmark away from HyperDex.<p>* MongoDB and Cassandra operate on the key for the search benchmark, while HyperDex operates (solely) on secondary attributes.  Another bias against HyperDex.<p>Most of our gain in the benchmarks comes from high GET throughput and high SEARCH throughput, although PUTs are competitive as well.<p>We are faster than MongoDB because they do idiotic stuff they don't have to.  When I was investigating why HyperDex is faster, I looked solely at client libraries (since MongoDB's default config just writes to socket buffers, or buffers it in userspace).  HyperDex has one function to create the request packet, one function that enqueues it with a constant number of operations, and one function to flush the queue.  Once a request is created it is not copied until the kernel moves it to the a socket buffer.  MongoDB, on the other hand, bounces through half a dozen different layers, some of which perform memmove to compact the data, keeping it contiguous in memory.  While I've not examined the whole MongoDB code base, I suspect that it's more of the same.  I can tell you first hand that the same diligence paid to making the HyperDex client efficient was paid at all layers of the HyperDex stack.<p>Edit:  Trying to get bullets to work",1340630239

The little that's left over are mostly complains that PHP isnt something that it's not trying to be (strongly typed, most commonly)<p>Sounds an awful lot like you are just ignoring the things you don't want to hear.  It isn't just that PHP is weakly typed, it is that it has absurd type conversions that no other weakly typed language does, that aren't even consistent, and explicit casts don't serve the expected purpose of forcing the correct type:<p><pre><code>    ""1e1"" == ""10"" => True\n\n    $a = ""foo""; $b = 0; $c = ""bar"";\n    $a == $b => True\n    $b == $c => True\n    $a == $c => False\n\n    ""22 cream puffs"" == ""22 bullfrogs"" => False\n    ""12 zombies"" + ""10 young ladies"" == ""22 cream puffs"" => True\n\n    (string)""false"" == (int)0 => True\n</code></pre>\nPHP is full of bugs.  Ancient bugs that have existed since PHP3, and which are still there.  Serious bugs where the lexer or parser is outright broken:<p><pre><code>    $ perl -le 'print 07'\n    7\n    $ perl -le 'print 08'\n    Illegal octal digit '8' at -e line 1, at end of line\n    Execution of -e aborted due to compilation errors.\n    $ python -c 'print 07'\n    7\n    $ python -c 'print 08'\n     File """", line 1\n        print 08\n              ^\n    SyntaxError: invalid token\n    $ php -r 'print 07;'    \n    7\n    $ php -r 'print 08;'\n    0\n    \n    $ perl -le '$foo = 1; print(($foo == 1) ? ""uno"" : ($foo == 2) ? ""dos"" : ""tres"");'\n    uno\n    $ php -r '$foo = 1; print(($foo == 1) ? ""uno"" : ($foo == 2) ? ""dos"" : ""tres"");'\n    dos\n</code></pre>\nPHP is written by absolutely incompetent developers.  There were 37 exploitable vulnerabilities in 2011.  Compare that to 3 for python, 3 for perl, and 7 for ruby.  Steffan Esser was the only person attempting to make the PHP project give a shit about security, and he ended up giving up on it because the other PHP devs absolutely refused to consider security as important.<p>These are not problems that are fixed in recent versions of PHP.  They are not misinformation.  If you want to revel in your ignorance, feel free.  But don't expect the rest of the world to tip toe around the facts to avoid inconveniencing you with reality.",1340630180

The contention is that many companies want a Norman and so will pass over a John, even when a Norman is not available (hence creating the perception of a shortage).  Furthermore, these companies usually do not <i>need</i> a Norman; a John would work out fine.<p>A number of posters in this thread assert that anyone who can write code competently[0] can get a job in this economy.  I personally, as with the OP, don't see that.  I see two broad groupings of companies[1].  The first group only wants Normans or near-Normans, and complain that there are not enough of them to fill their slots.  The second group is happy with Johns, but drops a laundry list of (sometimes conflicting) skills and experience requirements that filter out almost all of the Johns, and then complains that there are not enough of them to fill their slots.  I have also encountered an overlapping subgroup of companies willing to compromise somewhat for local candidates.<p>Unfortunately its difficult to move beyond anecdotes on this matter.  I have some that support the OP's point, many here have some that refute it.  It would be really interesting to see distrbutions of these anecdotes by geography, experience level, and undergrad program, though.<p>[0] ""Competently"" goes beyond writing FizzBuzz in this case.\n[1] I am not asserting that every company falls into one or the other; my current one does not, though my previous one does.

I'd certainly be interested in seeing alternative implementations, if you know of any that are decent.<p>Also, a maybe more serious issue is that since it's not idiomatic Java you'd have to do a lot of wrapping around libraries, and hard-selling to colleagues.

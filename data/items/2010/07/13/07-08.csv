Figure out a data structure that holds the information you're application is going to use, and once you've got that you've also got your object model.<p>You can then generate your whole backend by pointing your favorite code generator at the database schema.  You'll end up with the same User, Customer, BlogEntry or whatever objects you would have come up with if you'd just started coding from scratch, but they'll come with a .Save() method that stores them away in a data model that fits them perfectly.",1279007818

Both were rapidly changing into portals to create a useful business model. The first time I used Google (a few months into the public beta I think) I was totally totally blown away by the fact that the obscure page I needed came first or second in the rankings. The ""I feel lucky"" button was a startling statement of self-belief by Google.<p>So, yes, in both cases the broader market didn't believe that real innovation in product or business model was possible.",1279007719

I'm fully in the ORM camp, but it is true that I can't turn on SQL statement logging without being terribly embarassed.

One of the ways that this water returns to sea is to form a rip current, a narrow jet of water moving swiftly offshore, roughly perpendicular to the shoreline. Rip currents can be found on many surf beaches every day. Rip currents most typically form at low spots or breaks in sandbars, and also near structures such as groins, jetties and piers. Rip currents can occur at any beach with breaking waves, including the Great Lakes.""",1279005505

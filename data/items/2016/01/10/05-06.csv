10874393,comment,10872209,10873157,0,0,pheo,,,"Woah.<p>I think that many &quot;servers&quot; today aren&#x27;t going to benefit though from the level of optimization that you&#x27;re talking about. Network bandwidth is at least an order of magnitude slower than memory and PCI throughput. For all but the most heavyweight computational tasks (ie. gaming, finance, scientific computing, etc.) this kind of multiplexing optimization is very helpful. If you&#x27;re needing to get that kind of performance, you would userspace map off the NIC.<p>With how fast modern processors (CPUs and GPUs) are, whats much more important nowadays is not stalling on the flow from the NIC. The solution of the original author seems to me like a very simple fix for the old naive paradigm of state machine switching off from a single thread.<p>I think you might be (impressively) too close to the metal, and guilty of premature optimization. For example, a simple database application would benefit much more from keeping the slow I/O bottlenecks flowing than from the compute multiplexing.",1452405472

10874387,comment,10872852,10874149,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Schneier is discussing an unpleasant fact; unbiased algorithms often discover that things we previously attributed to bias were actually unbiased predictors. But we don&#x27;t like to admit this, so we instead make silly statements like the above.<p>There is a legitimate question as to whether an algorithm is actually unbiased. It could be quite accurate or there could be a bias, e.g. because the algorithm penalizes drug convictions and drug convictions have an unjustified bias due to racist or sexist enforcement.<p>The problem is it isn&#x27;t a simple question to answer. And people are going to want to choose their answer based on their politics.<p>But that can&#x27;t work. We can&#x27;t let a black box take discriminatory inputs and expect it to produce a just result. We also can&#x27;t just assume that every unequal outcome had an unjust cause, or we&#x27;ll end up e.g. causing loans to be given to uncreditworthy people and wrecking the economy (see also housing crash).<p>Which means that Schneier is wrong about quotas but exactly right that what we need is transparency. Because <i>if</i> there <i>is</i> unjustified bias then we need to understand why so we can prevent it, and if there <i>isn&#x27;t</i> then we need to understand why so we can accept it.",1452405399

Or the exact opposite: that the algorithms simply reflect results <i>caused</i> by bias, a <i>far</i> more likely relationship given what we know of history.<p>The reason we&#x27;re against this is not because we think our biases are not supported by real data; we know that some of them most certainly are. But we also know that a snapshot of current society is often little more than a reflection of social forces that has made the society what it is at this particular point in time, and treating them as immutable (or simply placing faith in their persistence) is nothing more than a political policy that helps perpetuate them. Treating past correlations as future predictors in a dynamic system such as society is programming conservatism into your algorithm. Acting on them is a political policy which strives to maintain the status quo -- there&#x27;s nothing wrong about it per se, if that&#x27;s what you want, but we need to be aware of this fact. Alternatively, we could program the algorithms to predict or even assist with social change.<p>The worst thing we can do is <i>accidentally</i> program politics into algorithms, and then fall for our own ruse and start believing that the algorithms are apolitical. That takes away our agency in making political choices.",1452405237

10874376,comment,10862265,10874006,0,0,wsxcde,,,"What are you qualifications in computer architecture? You&#x27;re arguing against pretty much everyone in the field.<p>> I&#x27;m surprised to see a lot of RISC proponents still around, because I think it&#x27;s quite clear that things didn&#x27;t quite work out the way they thought it would --- the vision of cheap, simple, high-performance CPUs just didn&#x27;t happen. Thus I&#x27;m not of the opinion that another &quot;MIPS, but free&quot; architecture is such a good idea.<p>You seem to be implying that there&#x27;s RISC failed. If you ask anyone who mattered in computer architecture ranging from academics like Patterson who literally wrote the most used books in the field to Intel fellows, they&#x27;ll all tell you that the essential point the RISC folks were making was proven right. This point being that RISC is requires less logic (=area,power) to implement, it&#x27;s easier to write compilers for, processors have faster cycle times, and so on.<p>In the end though, it turned out the market valued software compatibility over performance. That, good marketing and a phenomenally efficient supply chain and fab resulted in Intel winning. But don&#x27;t confuse this with CISC winning or RISC losing. If Intel had to do a clean slate design today, they&#x27;d do RISC themselves. In fact, Intel have a few proprietary microcontrollers hidden inside their chipsets and SoCs that were designed post-2005ish and these have RISC architectures.<p>> In my experience, statements like this really mean &quot;it&#x27;s actually really bad, but we don&#x27;t want to say that&quot;... after all, who would call benchmarks &quot;controversial&quot; if they were winning? There do tend to be few comparative benchmarks, but here&#x27;s one that shows how ARM and x86 are competitive, but MIPS is behind in energy efficiency:<p>The benchmark performance depends only on how much effort is put into optimizing the implementation. Intel have on average maybe 200 architects and 200 more designers tweaking their processors for performance for the last 30 years. It is completely absurd to expect a team of 10 or so grad students to compete with them.",1452405210

Heap size can grow, via sbrk, but if you moved the program break past the end of the Typed Array the code used as memory space, Emscripten could create a new Typed Array, copy over all data from the old to the new, free the old, and continue executing with data in the new.  That process was memory growth, and was very slow.  In practice, you never really needed it, since you could run your program a few times, see what the high water mark of your heap was, then set the precise size at compile time.<p>Memory growth was helpful if you wanted to start up faster, but could potentially have non-deterministic memory growth (though you&#x27;d still be limited to 32b address space).",1452404748

But it&#x27;s a rare occasion that I&#x27;d actually call a cab.<p>No CC in 2016 is insanely frustrating.  I paid for a ~$10 cab ride once with a $100 bill (the only cash I ever carry) after the driver claimed he couldn&#x27;t accept a CC.  Then he gave me ~$30 in change and semi-apologized with &quot;sorry I don&#x27;t have any more cash yet tonight&quot;.  I called bullshit and he managed to find another $10 or so.  If I hadn&#x27;t had quite a few drinks, I would have felt more comfortable calling the cops on him at the time, but really it just takes that happening once for me to refuse cash-only cabs.  I really had no idea how to respond especially since he told me that at the end of the ride at my apartment, which isn&#x27;t near an ATM.",1452402378
10874261,comment,10864176,10874105,0,0,catnaroek,,,"> My original objection was to the claim that a non-trivial program could be demonstrated to be &quot;provably correct.&quot; This statement is false. For non-trivial programs, it contradicts the simplest and most easily accessible interpretation of the Turing Halting problem and Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, both of which demonstrate that this is not possible.<p>You don&#x27;t need to solve the Halting problem (or find a way around Rice&#x27;s theorem, etc.) to write a single correct program and prove it so. A-whole-nother story is if you want a <i>decision procedure</i> for whether an arbitrary program in a Turing-complete language satisfies an arbitrary specification. Such a decision procedure would be nice to have, alas, provably cannot possibly exist.<p>To give an analogy, consider these two apparently contradictory facts:<p>(0) Real number [assuming a representation that supports the usual arithmetic operations] equality is only semidecidable: There is a procedure that, given two <i>arbitrary</i> reals, loops forever if they are equal, but halts if they aren&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t do better than this.<p>(1) You can easily tell that the real numbers 1+3 and 2+2 are equal. [You can, right?]<p>The “contradiction” is resolved by noting that the given reals 1+3 and 2+2 <i>aren&#x27;t arbitrary</i>, but were chosen to be equal right from the beginning, obviating the need to use the aforementioned procedure.<p>The way around the Halting problem is very similar: <i>Don&#x27;t write arbitrary programs.</i> Rather, design your programs right from the beginning so that you can prove whatever you need to prove about them. Typically, this is only possible if the program and the proof are developed together, rather than the latter after the former.<p>This much math you need to know if you want to lecture others on the Internet. :-p",1452402341

However, if you&#x27;re willing to consider ARM a RISC (well, almost) then there&#x27;s your market success.  Alpha completely <i>dominated</i> the performance segment for years, but they fell behind for reasons that has nothing to do with CISC vs. RISC.  At the time, x86 compatibility mattered more than it does today.<p>For people designing their own cores for whatever reason (there can be many, research and commercial), RISC-V is very attractive because of all the reasons already given, but it&#x27;s obviously not the only option.<p>RISC-V is carefully designed compromise; it scales down to extremely cheap cores and up to superscalar.  Like Alpha before it, extreme attention has been paid to avoid features/choices that would be bad for OoOE implementations.  Some examples:<p>- rs1, rs2, rd fields are <i>always</i> in the same location and <i>all</i> register sources and destinations are explicit (makes decoding faster and you can start fetching/renaming without having decoded)<p>- there are no branch delay slots<p>- instructions produce at most a single result<p>- no condition codes etc (dependencies are explicit)<p>- the sign-bit for all immediate fields is in a fixed location (cheaper sign-extension)<p>and so forth.<p>I&#x27;m also a big fan of the conditional branch instruction which unlike the Alpha can compare two registers.",1452402268

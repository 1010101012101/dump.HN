288736,comment,288398,288526,0,0,netcan,,,"I think you guys are going down the wrong path here.<p>It doesn't matter (to the status of piracy) whether or not piracy is harmful or any other consequences. If 90% of shoplifters get hit with a sudden case of Dostoevsky & slip envelopes under doors resulting in 120% ... It would still be theft. Just like assault is still assault if they sober up & buy you an icecream.<p>I'm not saying piracy is theft. It is different enough to warrant its own word (& its own treatment). 'Preventing revenue' is not a reasonable explanation. Standing outside a store and yelling like a madman scaring away customers is also preventing (stealing?) revenue.<p>In some cases, I think that piracy is helpful to companies  (photoshop might be an example) in others it's harmful. But that's besides the point. You can invoke that in a wider discussion of how laws should be made or you may be making a moral assertion that rights & such aren't important, only consequences. But that's not really our system (or most people's understanding).<p>Anyway this discussion is 90% semantics. It's only important to propaganda campaigns (saying stealing is more effective then saying violating copyright).",1219888470

Every time you hit Feed Y, you get the RSS for the last 25 postings which takes up bandwidth and possibly processing power for the remote server to generate and processing power and bandwidth on your end to download and consume.  BAD!  So much waste trying to make sure we get instant updates!<p>So, Feed Y creates a little ""I was last updated at time()"" feed.  You download that and are transmitting very little unless there's an update in which case you grab the feed.  Awesome!  Now, I ping 1,000,000 ""I was updated at time()"" feeds for various Facebook users. . .hmm, that's a ton of HTTP requests and transmission over head.<p>Scratch that, let's have Facebook create a single feed of all their feeds that have been updated in the past 60, 300, and 600 seconds!  So, we hit that every 30 seconds and update then grab whatever is new!  Wow!  That means that for me to digest updates for all my users who want their Facebook feeding into my service, I just hit one SUP feed and then grab whatever that SUP feed says has changed.  That's a lot better than hitting 1,000,000 feeds every 30 seconds.<p>So, this isn't good for your RSS reader or whatnot, but it would be huge for sites like Friendfeed or anything that feeds Friendfeed since it would reduce the bandwidth and processing on both sides.  As they said, they are likely to miss some updates with SUP, but if they can get 90% of the updates that way, they can change from pinging individual feeds every 30 minutes to pining them every 300 minutes and still get new items 10 times as fast by pinging the SUP feeds every 3 minutes.<p>Cool.  Practical.  Open.  Good-Neighbor vibrations for services they pull from.

Part of the philosophy behind these talks is that, just because a piece of software works (and sells, and pays your bills, etc) doesn&#x27;t mean it is good software or that is well programmed. Different people measure quality based on bugs, or crashes, or responsiveness, or size, or <i>argh</i> how beautiful it is.<p>But it also is not just about efficiency at runtime. Some of these talks dive into how certain approaches to software design (like traditional OOP) have gained traction for their appearance of utility rather than their actual value. Or in some cases, as shown in the post you reply to, because they are more &quot;easy and fun.&quot;",1412844793

I was working on exploiting the problem of the statement &quot;if Chinese people have Maker culture there will be (same_ratio * population_base) open source projects&quot;. I should have quoted it there.<p>Anyway there&#x27;s one thing clear (for me), that one create and share when he/she stops struggling for living.<p>So ok here&#x27;s a better model:<p>(same_ratio * max(0, non_struggling_population(china))<p>But given the fact that open source didn&#x27;t make it here, this one doesn&#x27;t make sense (because I know that some  little portion of this huge base is really not struggling). nevermind:<p>(get_ratio_by_culture(china) * max( ..... ))

`this is what we get at this point.<p>Ugh, too simple isn&#x27;t it, I&#x27;d really like to see something more interesting.<p>Let&#x27;s first not introduce forums, IM groups of producers.
Just consider one thing: Chinese people crack things.
The more &#x27;struggling&#x27; they are, the more they crack, but the skill gets lower.
Say that now we have a close source binary.
Some top-notched hackers extracted/disassembled the code to make it more readable, and runnable. (Maybe they&#x27;re from Russia, just sayin :-D
Lower tier programmers bind hooks to the routines.
Lower tier programmers use editors to iterate through the binary to seek for useful literals, inject resources to make mods...
Lower tier <i>resellers</i>, though not capable of these technical stuff, are able to follow the tutorials released by all higher tiers, and subtly modify the thing.<p>And this model suddenly becomes a non-deterministic close-source-binary cracking ecosystem, that tries many possible solutions simultaneously, and hierarchically(given the fan-out factor high enough between each two tiers).<p>Yeah I know you would never say this is &quot;good&quot;. But I think this is at least mathematically interesting. And it gives some sense to how to utilize this kind of ecosystems to do something real(though this model is still far from realistic).<p>> I would say that both Japan and Korea are ahead<p>Sure. Just consider get_ratio_by_culture() and non_struggling_population().<p>get_ratio_by_culture() is similar. It doesn&#x27;t mean the current whole picture is similar. But the later one is variable and the former one is nearly const.",1412843881

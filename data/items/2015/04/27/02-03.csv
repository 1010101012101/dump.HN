I&#x27;d look for people who&#x27;ve been successful, and who you can connect to through your network (if you aren&#x27;t investing time in building up your network in LinkedIn, I suggest you do so).<p>There&#x27;s a LOT of entrepreneurs who take a few times to come up with something that succeeds. Personally (I&#x27;ve founded 2 startups and worked at 4 others), I think it&#x27;s much more about the people than the idea.<p>Get to know people who are passionate about creating things. Find some amongst them who have common interests. Build something you love. If others love it, too, you will build success.<p>I&#x27;m always happy to help people early in their careers (like you, at your ripe young age of 25). If you can&#x27;t find others to help you, send me a THOUGHTFUL intro on LinkedIn, and I&#x27;ll be happy to talk. <a href=""http://linkedin.com/in/triantos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linkedin.com/in/triantos</a><p>Good luck!",1430103554

As the original article mentions, it&#x27;s not much of a stretch to imagine an app that looks at your demographics and preferences and tells you who to vote for.  And from there, why not apps that choose where to live, what career to pursue, or who to marry?  Some day, it may even seem foolish <i>not</i> to defer to apps for important decisions.

Doing- After I&#x27;ve learned how to do something, and actually done it a few times, it becomes routine.  It is less fun, but I can get into a longer flow.  This is great for deadlines, because I don&#x27;t have to think too much at 4:00am spazzing out on caffeine, since I&#x27;ve done it all before.<p>To be the most productive, I find I have to do both.

Just keeping them for eggs is very simple and has a lot of upside... best quality eggs available, nice yard art, fun for kids, life/death lessons for kids, etc. I have been thinking a lot about how much meat my family eats recently and nothing helped put that into sharper focus than starting to butcher some of our own animals. Whereas keeping poultry in order to gather a family&#x27;s worth of eggs is pretty simple, the idea of producing all our own meat is really a tall order. We eat at least one full chicken a week, and those are pretty big. It would take at least two ducks to supplement that one fat chicken and even then we are eating a lot of other meat. We ended up buying half a cow from a friend and that goes a lot further.<p>On butchering side of things, raising around 100 birds a year for slaughter would be crazy for us. Going from a full vegan lifestyle a few years back to slaughtering and butchering some of our own food has been an interesting change. I would recommend it if you have second guessed any of the weirdness with how food makes it to your plate. It definitely gives you something to think about. Killing really cute ducks that we raised by hand was definitely tough in the beginning. I had never hunted or killed any animal on purpose before. It&#x27;s always a bummer but it does get a little easier in time. We&#x27;ve got a bunch of our eggs in our incubator now, hoping for more ducks in 24 days!",1430102511

9444140,comment,9443048,9443048,0,0,coliveira,,,"The difference between books and Internet articles is depth. A good book can take you from knowing nothing to a relatively deep understanding of a topic -- by nature of its format. Consider for example one of the classic books of all time: Newton&#x27;s Principia. You can start reading that book with just a basic knowledge of geometry, and in a couple hundred pages later you&#x27;ll know more about physics then you ever thought possible. And that book was presenting physics <i>for the first time!</i> That&#x27;s not something you can replicate with Internet articles. It would be much more trouble to do that over the Internet, and you would cry &quot;please, write a book and send it to me so I can read all this information in a easier way&quot;. Other books are like that, not only in science but also in literature, philosophy, computing (e.g.: TAOCP) and so many other areas.<p>The problem we have nowadays is that, because it became so much easier to write books, we have more and more books that don&#x27;t add much to human knowledge. In the old times, writing and publishing a book was hard, which meant that the threshold for acceptance was much higher. Our society views this downgrading of book quality as a sign that books are not a good format, when in fact this is just an unintended consequence of our technology.",1430101935

You essentially become your own psychoanalyst.<p>Further, you can start to be &quot;mindful&quot; of others: acknowledging (consoling yourself with a little mental self-love is good here, &quot;pet your inner monkey&quot;) and letting go of the feelings that resulted from their behaviours that upset you so that you can free yourself from the hurt and resentment they cause early, and allow yourself to explore an understanding as to why they acted the way that they did. Often (almost always) you can quickly establish some reasoning for their actions that don&#x27;t involve unreasonable malice towards you, and thus you can dispose of thoughts that had they lingered would have festered and contributed further to your already &#x27;sensitive&#x27; mental state.<p>So while it seems to an observer that early mindfulness practice is focussed on meditation and the literal present moment, its long-term concern is on giving the practitioner the ability to keep an eye on their &quot;present&quot; -- that is, their stream of consciousness -- so they can manage negative thoughts effectively and mitigate any potential damage they could cause, developing strategies to cope with them more easily and eventually moving to an automatic, unconscious response that instantly changes the malignant &quot;Bob is mad at me, I must have done something horribly wrong&quot; to the far more benign &quot;Bob is mad at me, he must be having a bad day.

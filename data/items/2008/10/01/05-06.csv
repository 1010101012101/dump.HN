320424,comment,319889,320393,0,0,131072,,,"Disney is typically cited as a major force behind the never-ending extension of copyright (the famous 'keep mickey out of the public domain' strategy). Disney has also put considerable resources into lobbying for ever-more-oppressive legal measures such as mandatory DRM hardware in computers. They are no friend of the typical hacker. Steve Jobs, as a major shareholder and board member, could influence this if he so chose. Apple also chose to continue its weapons-grade product lines when it purchased PA Semi. Maybe they have a contract they can't get out of, but they may well have had the choice to shut down or spin off those products.<p>You can agree or not with those arguments, I'm not advocating for or against them. They don't affect my purchasing decisions (the best tool for the job in my current circumstances is a MacBook Pro so that's what I have). I make my living working for banks that no doubt finance far worse things. If Disney returns to form animation-wise I'll reward them with movie ticket purchases. It just seems to me that all the people posting ""Apple is finally evil"" linkbait nonsense could choose meatier targets than mistakes in developer relations, and the fact they choose not to means they're not even any good at being wrong.<p>It's crappy linkbait blog post pollution that irritates me, not anything that Apple's doing.",1222840524

Maybe he had dreams of something more but was unwilling to put the time in.<p>The home depot guy put the time in and worked his butt off to build his dream.<p>The same applies to startups. You guys can have Ideas, 4.0s and 39 act scores but if you don't put the time necessary to achieve your dreams you will never, EVER get there.<p>Success is how happy you are. Nobody can measure it and its different for every person. The best definination I can think for success is how happy the person is, in other words the goal of life is to be happy.<p>Also remember to achieve big dreams you need to give up BIG TIME. If anyone here has read East of Eden by John Steinbeck he visits these exact ideas. Its lonely at the top.",1222840373

320415,story,,,22,17,DarkShikari,"The Problem of a Lack of Downvoting.",,"Recently, I've noticed that a lot of the articles reaching the frontpage of HN, and often the top thereof, were flamebait/troll blog posts, off-topic (e.g. politics), or whatever.  But moreso, the majority of posters in the comments often agreed that the article was junk!  As such, one wonders, how in the world did the article rise to the top?<p>The problem is that when you don't allow downvoting, while it prevents the problem on sites like Reddit and Digg of ""organized downvotes"" and hivemind downvoting of disagreeing views, it also means that something's score depends solely on the number of upvotes.  So, if you post something extremely controversial that doesn't belong on HN, it can get more upvotes that most other posts.  Why is this?  Here's an example (let's say HN has 1000 readers, for simple math):<p>Let's say you post Article A, a politics piece railing against, say... Nancy Pelosi.  Lots of people are going to look at it, since its controversial, and everyone has an opinion.  Let's say 50% of HN readers look at it, and 20% of those upvote it, and 60% of those would have wanted to downvote it.  With downvotes, the article would have been buried quickly.  But this article gets 100 upvotes and quickly flies to the top.<p>Now, let's say you post a very interesting article on creative use of assembly, Article B.  Not nearly as many people will look at it--let's say 10% of readers.  And let's say 40% of those upvote it, and 10% of those would have downvoted it if they could.  The article only gets 40 upvotes, despite being much better and more on-topic HN content.<p>It seems to me to be much like the classic ""color of the bikeshed"" issue; if its something everyone has an opinion about, it gets voted up even if the majority of people think the link is junk or offtopic.<p>Now, my question is--how can this problem be resolved without reintroducing the problem of downvotes?",1222839850
320414,comment,320355,320355,0,0,ahizzle,,,"One of the very noticeable things I've observed, and I'm sure someone else has already blogged about this, is that if you're doing something ""new"" people will hate on it because it can't be done... but if you're doing something that sounds like it's already been ""done"", you'll get hated on because you shouldn't bother doing it.<p>Really it boils down to being able to differentiate hater-ade from constructive criticism.",1222839717

If you give out bribes there is possibility bribery can also be used against you. So be careful how you deal with this kind of activity.

Meanwhile, they've reinstated their 2D animation department, which is BIG fun news and which might bring back the good old Disney.<p>Why should we criticize them for making weapons components or for owning Disney?

I don&#x27;t know too much about elite universities, but the fact that Facebook originated from someone attending Harvard and Airbnb originated from an RISD alum is evidence that any university has a fair chance of starting the next hot company.  Maybe even someone who hasn&#x27;t attended university at all might start it.<p>Imagine if Google wasn&#x27;t able to raise funding because someone was prejudiced against where the founders went to university, or whether they attended university.  How different would the world be?  That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s mistaken to place so much emphasis on Stanford.

What is the philosophy behind it, and how do you deduce that we can achieve peace and prosperity by forcing others to do the will of a small group in power?<p>Who gives anyone the right to steal from Google? I&#x27;m not on board with that. There&#x27;s a reason companies leave the US and it&#x27;s because it has the highest corporate tax in the world at 35%. Google does not live in the US. It does not owe anything to public education, healthcare, roads or infrastructure. Google is a company that allows me to search on the internet. They get paid to show me ads. I could go on and on about what they are and the topic of &quot;roads&quot; would never figure.<p>If you want to argue that the founders or the employees of Google need to care about education, healthcare, roads, that&#x27;s another topic, but I&#x27;m talking specifically about corporate tax. How is Google making billions <i>at the expense</i> of public good? How much do they owe the public, exactly? Is Google forever indentured to the State? Will it never be free? Are you OK with never being free?<p>I would say Google has provided plenty of goods to the public and it has paid more than its share several times over. We&#x27;re all better off because it exists, and the service they provide is even free. It&#x27;s free and you want to make it more expensive.<p>It&#x27;s almost as if you&#x27;re angry at how much money they&#x27;re making. &quot;Keeping high profit margins&quot; is exactly what anyone would do because as human beings we want to feel safe, and high profit margins provide the safety that you will have enough resources to change your course of action if necessary, adapting to new market conditions and consumer demands. You want to erode that safety buffer and make Google more fragile.<p>Your wording says it all: &quot;Google [..] could [...] drop a couple of zeros from their [...] profit&quot;. The profits are their reward for supplying something we all want. We all use it daily, it&#x27;s free, it&#x27;s amazing and they keep making more cool stuff, and because of that the market has rewarded them. And you&#x27;re advocating stealing their reward to fix roads. But we don&#x27;t even know if people want roads! They&#x27;re there so that&#x27;s why people use them, but who&#x27;s to say we don&#x27;t want something better? Well, we&#x27;ll never know, because the State said &quot;roads it is&quot; and they&#x27;re sticking to it, even when the upkeep gets harder and harder. Is the State looking into alternatives to roads? No? We went through a bunch of search companies like AltaVista and Lycos and so on and it took all this time to realize Google was what we wanted, and we&#x27;ve rewarded them for that. What is the State doing to foster a bunch of alternative ways of transportation in order to pick the best so we can reward it?<p>Oh, you mean you just want roads period, and you want to force everyone to pay for this product, and you don&#x27;t think there could be alternatives so that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re not looking into competing ideas? So let&#x27;s force Google to pay for this product that was artificially designed and not evolved from market forces like Google&#x27;s product were? And Google should pay up because it has so much money and it would still be profitable if it sacrificed a few zeroes? Can you please justify this line of thinking to me ethically? Here we have two organizations, one puts out a crummy product it can&#x27;t maintain, and the other puts out a good product that people said they would pay for; and you&#x27;re saying we should take money from the successful product and use it to build more of the unsuccessful product. Do you see what I see? Because from here it&#x27;s clear the solution would be for the State to simply stop making crummy products and stop stealing from successful products, but somehow we&#x27;ve escalated this problem all the way to the level of global corporate taxes.",1410932845

Damaged product littering the bottom shelves, discarded items all over the store from various departments, mis-shelved items. No attempt at proper sorting of  items that had only subtle differences.<p>It is very easy to imagine that their inventory management reports 6 of some item, but not a single one is in the place it is supposed to be.<p>If automatic reorder doesn&#x27;t kick in until 0, then there are likely many items that will never be replenished until a full inventory is performed.

It&#x27;s really disappointing that someone who could potentially be such a force for good in the world gets derailed by what is basically tribalism.<p>Two parties can disagree on 99% of their beliefs, yet still find ways to come together on the 1% that they happen to agree on. These parties can work together to each others&#x27; mutual benefit, and the world is better for it. But nooooooooo, not RMS. He has to demonize anyone who is not 100% in lockstep with him on everything, to everyone&#x27;s detriment, and throw his &quot;adversaries&quot; into a trash bin labelled &quot;Others&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a self-fulfilling prophecy. It&#x27;s easy to drive people apart in the name of some ideal. It takes actual leadership to drive otherwise separate people together to actually accomplish something. I have wished for so many years that RMS would care enough to provide the latter instead of the usual former.",1410931408

You need something for a wheelchair? Fine, they send you what&#x27;s available from their fleet.<p>When you request a ride from Uber or Lyft, those two are just middlemen who put you in touch with one of a thousand little companies. Potentially, each one is available.<p>So, here&#x27;s the evil bit: require each ride-providing service (a taxi company or an Uber contractor or a Lyft contractor) to provide a minimum of one or two ADA-compliant vehicles.<p>The independent contractors for Uber and Lyft immediately go away, except for the one or two that are so wealthy as to be able to afford a ramp-van or other compliant vehicle.",1410930945

8328694,comment,8328206,8328662,0,0,muuh-gnu,,,"The decision to go either Common Lisp or Scheme was made based on RMS very personal reasons and conflicts with close-source Lisp machine companies during the first half of the 80s.<p>GNU has had two common Lisp implementations under their umbrella at least since mid 90s (CLISP (of Viaweb fame) and GCL (of Maxima fame)), but due to RMS&#x27; hate of Symbolics and Common Lisp, all of the effort was invested into making Guile run properly (which took them 25 years and still nobody is using it) and the two Lisps were basically orphaned.<p>The latest effort of guile-ifying Emacs is more pushed by the Guile guys, in order to attach themselves to an already existing killer app (emacs) and to basically force more and more people to use Scheme, because nobody is doing it voluntarily.<p>The Emacs guys, as you see from the post, are not _really_ excited about the idea of switching to another _language_. They want FFI, multithreading, etc, but they do not necessarily want Scheme. Actually they dont want Scheme at all, adopting Scheme would be just a price to get FFI, etc.<p>Of course the proper way would be to go Common Lisp. Elisp is and has always been a subset of Common Lisp, and they&#x27;ve had a Common Lisp compatibility layer for decades, and a lot of packages use it. The problem is simply highly political. You&#x27;d have to confront RMS, and you&#x27;d have to finally get rid of Guile&#x27;s &quot;official GNU extension language&quot; status.",1410930722

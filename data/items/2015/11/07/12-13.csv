It&#x27;s also about being perceived as really successful by other people, so it&#x27;s not just about &quot;winning&quot; the &quot;competition&quot; of who has the &quot;best&quot; life, it&#x27;s about winning the competition of who other people think has the best life, which is a competition in which it doesn&#x27;t matter whether there&#x27;s a lot that you&#x27;re not hearing about the winners, because the majority of people (the judges) will only take the stuff you <i>do</i> hear into account.<p>I hope that makes sense, couldn&#x27;t really think of a good way to phrase it.",1446901142

Why should the benefit born of random chance overrule our humanity?<p>&quot;We find that increasing the income share of the poor and the middle class actually increases growth while a rising income share of the top 20 percent results in lower growth—that is, when the rich get richer, benefits do not trickle down.&quot; (Dabla-Norris et al., <a href=""http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=42986.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=42986.0</a>)<p>[FWIW I don&#x27;t agree that GDP is the best measure of improvements in society but it at least appears to indicate the efficiency - within humanitarian bounds - of a capitalist system.

When our second child was born and our preschool/daycare costs went from $1250/mo to $2650/mo, it was not nearly so clear.  Ultimately, she kept working because we determined the opportunity cost of taking years off (and missing those 401K contributions) would far outweigh the outlay for childcare, but we did think long and hard at that point.  Childcare was consuming >50% of her take home.",1446897710

As it turns out Soviet pilots occasionally flew in Korea and gave US pilots a run for their money.<p>Mig-15,17, and 19s were giving F-4&#x27;s a run for their money in Vietnam until Phantom pilots quit trying to turn with the smaller Migs and just used their giant J79 engines w/ afterburner to fight vertically.  I believe the Phantoms always had the advantage but it was obscene to lose a 2 crew multirole state of the art fighter like an f-4 for every one or two outdated Mig-15s that were shot down.<p>The Mig-21 was a point defense interceptor intended to zoom up to altitude quickly and intercept US bombers.  It was a reasonable fighter because it&#x27;s wing.  Delta wings don&#x27;t have a sharp stall angle like other types of wings, they just start piling on drag as the angle of attack increases.  The closest US fighter is terms of design is probably the f-104, but the Mig-21 was really in the same class performance wise as the f-4.<p>The Mig-29, SU-27 and on are solid first class fighters and probably have the edge on the F-16 and F-15.",1446897690

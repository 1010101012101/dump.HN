3350110,comment,3349670,3350026,4,0,cheald,,,"You're right - but I'd argue that the difference is just in default behavior, as you touched on in your edit. Ruby procs are bound to their lexical scope, and implicitly include self as a part of that scope. The function still has to be aware of some scope to run, though.<p>(I didn't know about assigning self in instance_eval, though - that makes me all kinds of happy!)<p>What I meant to convey is that every language that uses first class functions (I guess I should say ""any language with first class functions and the concept of this/self"") has to deal with the problem of execution context. Languages like Ruby and Python assume the common case and bundle the context by default. Languages like Javascript and Lua don't, leaving it up to the caller to explicitly specify. In all cases, though, the callee has to be made aware of <i>some</i> context, which is what I meant by the `this` problem. My point is that since Javascript requires explicit binding, a language construct that allows Ruby-style implicit binding is nice syntactic sugar. The author seemed to be conveying the idea that using jQuery's $.proxy magically freed him from the need to pass context around, which is just simply not the case.",1323823935

3350035,comment,3348671,3348671,4,0,Mz,,,"I attempted suicide at age 17.  I was also hospitalized twice for being suicidal, once in my teens and once in my twenties. I spent a lot of time in therapy (to deal with an abusive childhood), a lot of time working on getting a life and doing some serious problem solving (with regards to personal issues), and a lot of time resolving underlying health issues (that were undiagnosed when I was younger).  I am currently facing eviction and doing so fairly calmly.  I have no idea where I will go.  I may literally be sleeping in the woods in winter come January.  And I feel like I'm losing my mind because I'm not suicidal when I ""should"" be.<p>If, as one person here commented, you feel there is something broken with your brain, take that seriously.  I've read some things about arachadonic acid and depression.  And this happens to be an issue I addressed for unrelated reasons.  I consciously and intentionally changed my body chemistry to address my health issues and that is likely part of why I am currently <i>not</i> suicidal in spite of being very short of sleep and in serious financial trouble and feeling like the entire world doesn't give a flying fuck about my accomplishments, my situation and so on.<p>If you are going through major transitions and that is a source of stress, there are more effective means to deal with those things too.  I'm too short of sleep to write a book on the topic, I just want to make the point that if you  feel something really negative, don't focus on your feelings.  Focus on finding the roots of the problem, whether that is solving stressful life situations, addressing brain chemistry issues or something else.<p>Anyway, this is not something you have to just swallow.  And in my experience, the touchy-feely emotional outreach stuff is not real effective.  I was suicidal in part due to health issues and in part due to being molested and raped.  Healing my sexuality and my body has changed that and I can say that with confidence because I've spent the last 12 days wondering why on earth I am <i>not</i> suicidal while facing eviction, dealing with a mountain of debt...etc...ad nauseum.  Instead of falling apart and having histrionics, I am making plans to the best of my ability and working overtime.<p>Best of luck to anyone struggling with something like this.",1323822436

If I am in a slump and feeling like it is all too much I force myself to do some exercise. A chin-up, a push-up, go for a run or a swim. If I am feeling really bad I will make myself do one push-up, on my knees. or just kneel on the floor and do a negative repetition. That's usually enough to get me started on doing something. Then I will go and eat some food. Or more likely, go to the shops and buy some food to cook. Then eat something. For me doing a little bit of exercise and then eating often makes enough of a difference that my misery is manageable.<p>There is some evidence that exercise is helpful for others in dealing with depression, e.g. [1] (A review paper) Anecdotally, this seems particularly the case if you are at all ADHD.<p>Long term I agree with all the other posts pointing out that seeking professional treatment is the best option. The pride factor was a huge problem for me and still is. I treat it like research. Psychiatrists and Psychologists, are experts in there field who I pay to explain options for treatment an methods for assessment and monitoring. Thankfully this has only happened once, but if they can't explain the different options and why the course of action they recommend is the best I find a different doctor.<p>1.  <a href=""http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/7/1/13"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/7/1/13</a>",1323821675

If you can't recognize a code smell when you're writing code, the problem is probably that you aren't mature enough as a developer, not that the language is bad for allowing it. I don't think that most seasoned developers would look at that 160-column list comprehension, say ""okay, that works!"" and move on to the next task. They'd say ""okay, that works, but holy crap it's ugly. Quick, to the refactormobile!"" I've seen 160+ column nested ternary operations in pure Javascript that make the aforementioned comprehension look positively poetic.<p>I've seen some genuinely horrible Javascript. Like, stuff that so terribly abuses the language without any comprehension whatsoever of closures or context binding and only works because the author got <i>stupidly lucky</i> and/or abused globals so badly that the code was effectively one giant function.

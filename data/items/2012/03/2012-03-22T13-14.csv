Then you would be driven to learn Mandarin because you would need huge chunks of it for very real things.  NOT learning Mandarin would be more painful than learning it.<p>You need a project.  You need a project complex enough that you need huge chunks of programming knowledge to implement functionality.

3739667,comment,3735388,3736905,1,0,snowwrestler,,,"I don't think so, and here's why: we are post-scarcity when it comes to bottled water. You don't deprive any other 7/11 customer of bottled water when you shoplift, because 7/11 carries a lot of bottled water and has developed processes that ensure they never run out.<p>You could probably shoplift all the bottled water you can carry, every day, and you still would not deprive another customer. 7/11 would simply keep shipping in more water so they would have product to sell. (Of course they would also get some cops in there to try and stop you!)<p>Eventually, if they're not making enough money due to all the shoplifting, they might stop carrying bottled water. But that won't be because they ran out of supply; it will be because it's no longer profitable to do so. This is analogous to a movie studio deciding not to make or distribute certain kinds of movies anymore because it is no longer profitable for them.<p>What about the store? Surely you're depriving them of the bottle of water, right? Again, not really. The store does not actually want to possess so many bottles of water--what they want is to make money by selling bottles of water. And if you look at the economics of the transaction, that's primarily what you're depriving them of. Let's say a bottle of water is priced at $1.50. 7/11, who buys in bulk and then marks up, probably paid $0.50 or less for that same bottle. Thus when you steal it, 66% of the harm is in foregone revenue! Only 33% of the harm is loss of property value. Again, this is analogous to copyright infringement, where the primary harm is foregone revenue, not deprivation of property.",1332424591

3739621,comment,3735874,3739362,3,0,moe,,,"<i>Isn't ""they could serve direct links as static HTML"" the whole point of this discussion?</i><p>For me the point of the discussion was the claim that the first-load performance of a fat-client app is inherently terrible.<p>This is false.<p>It is a straightforward optimization problem. Twitter didn't care to optimize.<p>I don't think it is under debate that the overall responsiveness (after first-load) in a client-side app is heads and shoulders above anything you can achieve in the request/response paradigm. Network latency is real, AJAX can mitigate it but <i>instant response</i> is only possible when you don't hit the server.<p>So all we're talking about here is the specific (important) case of the initial page-load. As said above, that case has tons of optimization potential, up to the point where it's near indistinguishable from a regular HTML page-load.<p><i>Gmail is not a good example to support your case</i><p>This may be subjective. Yes, GMail is slow. But it loads faster than twitter for me, despite being significantly more complex. I also imagine google has less incentive to optimize the first-load because unlike twitter users rarely follow deep-links to gmail.<p>Now imagine twitter applied only the little optimization that google has to their much smaller app - the latency problem would probably not exist. And if that's not enough, I can only repeat: It's a valid approach to serve static HTML for direct tweet links (or just for everything) and upgrade it asynchronously.<p>My point is that it's very possible to optimize this problem away where it matters (deep links to tweets). I've done it myself a couple times. It's nasty gruntwork, involving endless Firebug sessions. Crying Foul and ""this is not possible"" is a lazy cop-out.",1332423776

This setup lends itself perfectly to vehicle-flow; each agent is a car, each car has a model for when it accelerates, when it slows down, when it turns, and so forth. Create enough of them, and you can start to simulate traffic jams and other interesting traffic phenomena.<p>Now, I have not studied this problem in particular. My research was on the effect of excessive lane-changing on overall traffic throughput (Spoiler: lane-changing tends to cause traffic to slow down behind the lane-changer, which means that system-wide lane-changing leads to traffic jams, but changing lanes is a strictly superior strategy for individual drivers in most situations.

Economics!)<p>However, it seems to me that it would be relatively simple to extend a traditional AB traffic model to include special vehicles that impose constraints on nearby cars.<p>If any of you are interested, there is an excellent java library developed at UChicago called Repast [<a href=""http://repast.sourceforge.net/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repast.sourceforge.net/index.html</a>] which contains a framework for building agent-based models.<p>You may also be interested in my favorite book on the subject, ""Micromotives and Macrobehavior"" [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Micromotives-Macrobehavior-Lectures-Public-Analysis/dp/0393090094"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Micromotives-Macrobehavior-Lectures-Pu...</a>] which is more rigorous than its Amazon description would have you believe.",1332423756

Usually, this is an indicator of one big underlying problem, therefore I assume that it is a problem in the US.<p>At least, this is how the author positions the situation and her individual case.<p>But..... in reality, at least based on what I observed in the multinational companies, where I worked, such behavior usually surfaces in three cases.<p>(1) The person does not understand how organizational dynamics and people/power play works, i.e. does not know the rules of the game.<p>(2) The person is not a good performer, or at least this is how colleagues perceive her or (for god sake) him.<p>(3) The corporate environment and culture OR the boss are negative - in this case most employees are treated like that.<p>Based on my personal experience:-<p>In case of (3) the best advice is to run - find another company that would value this particular individual strengths. There are plenty of companies out there. The life is not worth it to spend it on converting jerks to mother Theresa.<p>In case of (2) the best advice is to ""make yourself so good, that they can't ignore you"" [I do not recall that exact wording]. I seriously doubt that a valuable employee [i.e. she/he is the only one who can fix things with positive/negative impact on P&L] would be mistreated. In case she would be, than probably this is the case (3) - the company/boss does not understand the employee's value ---> same advice as above - run.   I recall two cases - female HR assistant and male Director of Strategy. The former was just dumb, and the latter was bullshitting his way around. In both cases gender had nothing to do with the fact that both had nothing to bring to the table. So the consensus of high-producing crowd (both female and male) was unanimous.<p>Usually, if a person is an excellent performer, these things (negative comments, stupid microtasks, etc) just do not appear or do not stick.<p>In case of (1) the best advice is to find a mentor (gender not relevant), who could teach or coach on how to behave oneself in a group or organization, so called organizational behavior or simply politics. It is difficult to summarize it, but the goal is to learn how to diffuse negative behavior towards you with humor, words or actions immediately at the point of action in such a way that everybody present would think that the one who initiated negative behavior is a jerk (or dumb, or idiot, or an asshole) without you calling names.<p>For example a comment from colleague<p><""Oop, Katie's got the low cut dress on today! I know where I'm sitting!""><p>can be rubuffed with<p>""Oop, John's got his socks smelling today! I know where I shall not be sitting"" or smth similar with a big smile.<p>The simple view and approach is to perceive such people as programs with bugs. To resolve the bug you need to understand how the whole piece is working and what's inside. Therefore, you need to understand each individual, what's inside, what are the bugs and how to approach/address them. Each one is unique and shall be dealt with as such.<p>Another approach is to start with yourself - how you perceive yourself and own self-confidence.<p>I agree with OneBytePerGreen that the author shall ""lighten up"". I do not recall the exact term, but the author perceives that the external environment is what controls her behavior and outcomes. Such view does not faciliate personal growth, or any growth per se. The only way to change is to understand simple fact that behavior of others is defined by your own behavior and start with yourself, because that's the only one a human being can change.<p>On a side note I especially disagree with one of the comments:\n<""Oop, Katie's got the low cut dress on today! I know where I'm sitting!""\nAnyone says that at my workplace and they will be shown the door in less than 120 seconds.><p>Acting like that is keeping the real issue under the table and unresolved. The real issue is the person's view of the world and lack of knowledge and understanding of how things work in life. A good boss or co-worker would teach or coach the person how to to deal with that.<p>Apologies for my English and, possibly, tone.

My point is simply that apps will continue to be produced, regardless.<p>Besides, even if its perfectly legal to copy apps (or music or movies) and distribute them however you like, that doesn't necessarily mean you can't monetize them. It doesn't even mean that you have to completely give up the pay-for-app model either - people will still be willing to pay for something they really like (I bought a CD online direct off a musician a few months back despite already having the mp3's and I've never even opened the CD!), but obviously a lot fewer people than now. Perhaps a pay what you want model would work. This can be offset in other ways - paid support, physical merchandise (printed documentation perhaps) and kickstarter-style ""I'll finish the app for $X"" are just a few ideas.<p>I'm not saying that this would definitely be sustainable, because I don't know, but I do see some potential there and either way, people will still make apps, music and movies regardless (though it will be less[1]).<p>I wonder is B2B sustainable on support contracts and custom work?<p>[1] Maybe hobbies of the future will revolve more around the production of (free) content and less about the consumption of (free or otherwise) content?

3739577,comment,3739166,3739166,1,0,tomkin,,,"I think this is going to be the Photoshop where people <i>seriously</i> start considering a web-based alternative. Not because CS6 will be poor software, but because I think the division among users who use Photoshop for photo editing/professional photography/restoration/stationary/brochure design and those who use it for designing web sites and applications is getting greater. The latter needing less of the options available in Photoshop today, let alone CS6. I say this with over 10 years of experience as a designer/developer – Photoshop needs a Basecamp simplicity-inspired derivative. I think as we move to more institutional, common & predictable UI (if we do), we'll find that we're doing very simple tasks and that those tasks can be taken from Photoshop and automated for the purpose of web/app design and execution. I know there are a few alternatives to Photoshop already, but of all the ones I've seen (yes, even Pixelmator) none of them really go for <i>just the web industry</i>. I think the market for such a tool (hopefully web-based) would be pretty great at this point – and given the audience – using state-of-the-art browser API wouldn't be much of an issue.<p>Long ago, Adobe had this product called ""Photoshop Server"" or something similar. I believe it was based off of Macromedia's Generator (which generated server-side Flash content). The concept was neat - place variables within a PSD, upload it and allow the server to render out based on what you wanted to show. The problem with this, of course, was that it was proprietary, heavy, expensive and overall pretty crappy. It would be really interesting to see someone create a web-based web design/development application that interacted with some OSS library that most hosting companies would allow (like gd, ning, etc), read .json and interpret data within the image.<p>Probably a bad idea, but how big would a .json-based image be compared to the average jpg? Pretty big, I'll bet. But I wonder with gzip compression how manageable could it be? Would be really cool to define information (text inside of the image, accessibility, SEO capabilities) within a .json-based image. No license required and it would be readable by any human or software.<p><pre><code>  {\n    ""dimensions"": { ""width"": 3, ""height"": 3 },\n    ""data"": [\n         [""rgba(255,255,255,1)"",""rgba(255,255,255,1)"",""rgba(255,255,255,1)""],\n         [""rgba(255,255,255,1)"",""rgba(255,255,255,1)"",""rgba(255,255,255,1)""],\n         [""rgba(255,255,255,1)"",""rgba(255,255,255,1)"",""rgba(255,255,255,1)""]\n     ]\n  }\n</code></pre>\nYep.

That ""programming ability"" is not the only criteria selected for?<p>In this case, and in most interview cases, there's already been some vetting done via resume/portfolio/phone, and face to face interviews are as much about personality and team fit as they are about technical competence.  Being able to demonstrate that you can think about others socially, include them in to a small ritual, and do it in a way that's memorable without coming across as too cheesy (I don't think I did) is... dare I say, a skill.<p>I've definitely been on the interviewer side of the table, and if someone had brought in some cookies to munch on, it would bode well.  If that's the <i>only</i> thing they do, and they still suck during the interview, no job.<p>I'd done this a few times over the years, and in a couple cases never even got a followup call back.  If it was <i>because</i> of the cookies/cake/snacks/whatever, then I'm <i>glad</i> I don't work at a place that's so uptight/rigid that they can't take some fun.<p>FWIW, I didn't take a job after that interview, but was offered one.",1332421343

Right now, any complex nesting of layer styles has to be done via Smart Objects, which is a terrible hack that has you saving, seeing what the effect on the final image is, then going back and making more changes, repeat.<p>- It's 2012. There should not be destructive filters anymore. All filters should just be another node in this layout. If you'd like to apply them, you should be able to right click a node and merge everything that feeds into it. Brushes should also be usable as layers. Composite everything.<p>- Where's this layer system going to go? Obviously, it will go on screen, but how about an iPad app that pairs with Photoshop for displaying and altering it? They already have something sort of like this for tools.<p>- Photoshop badly needs usable variables of some sort. I'm tired of jumping around 5 different places because I decided I want to change a color.<p>- Going with the last one, documents should be able to contain multiple images, like Illustrator does. This would be a great addition for icon design, since you could (easily, without ugly hacks) have all of your sizes in the same document. Combine that with variables, and...<p>- Finally, stop the sucky non-native UI already. Stop replacing perfectly good Cocoa widgets with terrible Air ones.<p>Adding fancy new features is nice and stuff, but the fundamental UI of this application is getting really dated.",1332421239

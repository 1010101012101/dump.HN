(AirBNB)<p>- Side note: YC is applying mass production techniques to venture funding.<p>- Measurement - Google Ads are popular because returns can be measured. Inventing a new way to measure more stuff is a good idea.<p>- Thoughts on the U.S.: As long as you have peace and people can make money and be entrepreneurs - then society will be prosperous. If bandits, government, invaders steal the money from people who make it then society could collapse.<p>- Let the good times roll in Silicon Valley. California is still rich. you can start a co. anywhere but it helps to be here.<p>- Higher resolution world, stuff gets done. Networks of little organizations that make things happen are more efficient. As products have more and more of a technical component, it becomes less of a good idea to become a big company.<p>- Economic inequality<p>- Moore's Law working, but differently.

Software and data will by default live on servers.<p>- Good customer service will be more important as it's easier for customers to switch.

You learn alot from talking to customers.<p>- Apparently frivolous stuff often turns out very useful.

Linux will be on servers for sure. Buy Apple stock. hackers are a leading indicator of what ppl will be using in the future. (Audience was 40% - 50% Macs)<p>- Everybody wants iPhones. Good for browsing the web. Problem for hackers because Apple are jerks. Android can't compete with iPhone. 
Apple cares about the iPhone the way Google cares about search.<p>- Design is something to bet on. China has made manufacturing a commodity. Design is software winning over hardware.<p>- Real-time is not bogus in the way ""Web 2.0"" was. Something definite going on, it's the computing equivalent from the change in going from dial-up to cable internet. Protocols may go real-time.<p>- Google Wave is going to be important. (Whoops)<p>- Venture funding is not going to go away because VCs need you. They may not have the upper hand they've had in the past. Will give people money on better terms.<p>- Founders will more and more have the upper hand. Investors are learning it does not work to fire founders. Really matters who the founders are.

I work on server apps mostly in c++, parsers, etc... systems that usually run on cron jobs, and not generally consumer facing.  I don't do front end-design well, or even at all.  Most of my ideas are very technical, and would not apply to anyone but a small subset of developers.<p>I believe that developers with ideas such as mine, are usually doing work for someone else, full time.<p>I've written several systems, that are pretty cool, but usually are the type to be open-sourced.  A recent example is a memcache like server I created, that stores the expiring data in the background on cloud storage, and can later be retrieved and reloaded into the memcache like server.  Stuff like this is really great, but a lot of sites don't get to be the size where they'd need to use it, and when coming up to needing something like this, its usually created by some big company out of need (like memcache) and then open sourced.  This is not something I'd go with for a start-up, and merely an example.  But this is mostly the kind of programs I write.<p>Are there any back-end developers here that have done a start-up, and become reasonably satisfied with their success (with a back-end idea?) or should I be looking into Objective-C for a Mobile game?  Creating the next remote-control my MacBookPro app, or even looking at some SAAS?

The real question is what are your long term goals?<p>This is how I see real estate investment.<p>PROS
- After paying off the mortgage you can still sell the house for its current value. If you select wisely, this is an additional investment.
- Monthly income that is generated as safely as possible. Since you can select a good market to invest in, and even select who is moving in. You have as much security as in a monthly payout as you are ever going to get.
- Can be used to leverage other investments. Equity can be an incredible tool.
- Makes your credit score and personal financial statement look amazing. If profitable, of course.
- You can invest money to make continued improvements on the property. And potentially increase it's value.
- Can live there is your significant other kicks you out (haha)<p>CONS
- Limited mobility. If you invest in real estate with are with it for a while.
- High initial cost. Unlike investing in stocks, it is difficult just to buy 10 shares google. You have invest quite a bit of personal capital.
- Ties your investment to the community. Which may be a positive if you don't like the swings of the investment market.<p>To say that an investment can be unsafe, or it is changing from a way you know how to make money to a way you don't, is an invalid reason not to do it.<p>Any investment can be unsafe. Business lose value all the time. General Motors has lost value consistently, buying there stock doesn't mean that Google Stock isn't going to be a great idea.<p>As for a learning curve, there was plenty to learn about stocks while learning to invest in those. There was plenty to learn about your startup before you could make it profitable. There will be plenty to learn about real estate as well.<p>Ultimately, what are your investment goals? How much money do you need, and how are you comfortable spending? Do you need money for huge investments, or are you content to have a steady safe income?<p>I love the idea of real estate investing just because it seems like it could replace the income from my job. Therefore, I would not have to work. Also, it gives you a base of credit to allow massive loans for massive expansions in business.<p>Also, if you don't screw it up, it can be multi-generational income.

This may be inconvenient, but it's true. Telling someone, ""You can do whatever you want with your life; we're not going to tell you what to do"" is effectively telling them, ""We're not going to tell you what society values and expects from you; you won't get any guidance from us."" It can be almost as bad to have too much choice as it is to have too little.",1282745141

We both bought condos that we lived in ourselves for a few years and we have both had about 30 years of rental income from. He bought another couple small units, and he quit working as a programmer when he was 40, he and his family live very frugally, and he has done nothing but property management since then.<p>My problem with the article: taking on a lot of debt. Bad idea, in my opinion. It is best to own much less property and have no debt on it. Of course, who wants to completely retire? I think that the trick is to make small income property investments, try to pay them off within a decade, and always work on what gives you pleasure, and don't concentrate on money.",1282745041

My prediction is there will be hundreds of micro chat sites in the next few years and there will be thousands of 'foursquares' similar to the way there are many, many ""social networks"" that aren't threatened by facebook.<p>1. Chat apps will appear for major cities that may or may not feed into a larger community. For instance, why doesn't someone launch 100 of these apps - Miami South Beach, Atlantic City, Vegas Strip, etc. I click it, i'm chatting with people I know are in Vegas and doing the same things... drinking and losing money, of course.<p>2. Reward systems will develop that are much more elaborate than a free beer for mayor. Pseudo-panzi-schemes with downlines, etc but tied to real financial rewards, to incentivize people to chat. For instance, you give people a share of ad revenue in proportion to how early they sign up in an area and how often they're online. Or prizes, or points that they can spend... Like groupon on top of chat?<p>3. Normal people will start to think of location based chat. Hashtags are a poor tech geek's way of filtering by location... if i'm tweeting to friends at a conference i wish i could <i>prevent</i> my friends who aren't there from receiving those messages. I know they don't care and don't want to be irritated at our elaborate tweeting about where to meet for the best Thai food in north america (which happens to be in Vegas, by the way). <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yelp.com/biz/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas</a>",1282744882

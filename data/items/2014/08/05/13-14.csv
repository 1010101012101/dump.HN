8136872,comment,8136340,8136340,3,0,DCKing,,,"I think many people are satisfied with the alternatives presented in that thread. A very large percentage will probably even be happy with the serialization to Lists and Maps - because that is what JavaScript already does! I understand that you have your preferences, and you are entitled to have those. In my opinion, you are not entitled to:<p>- Present your complaints as though Dart is missing basic functionality (not in the presence of the presented alternatives). It just misses <i>your specific</i> desired functionality!<p>- Assume your use case is representative for a significant amount of other developers.<p>- Extend your entitlement to the HN front page.<p>C# JSON support appears to be awesome, and you are very free to make a Dart library that does exactly that. You are also free to request it to be merged into the core Dart libraries [1]. You are not free, in my opinion, to drag out this complaint so much.<p>As a reference, here&#x27;s a list of other typed languages that don&#x27;t support JSON deserialization-to-classes in their core libraries:<p>- Java (Scala, Groovy, Xtend, etc...)<p>- GWT Java<p>- Kotlin (both on JVM <i>and</i> in browser)<p>- Ceylon<p>- C++<p>- OCaml<p>- Swift<p>- ...<p>Seeing those languages are often used to consume web services, it seems Dart is in good company. There&#x27;s probably a good reason why this stuff is relegated to third party libraries. I&#x27;d speculate that 1) accomplishing this is messy and complex in the context of type safety and 2) the problem you are complaining about simply isn&#x27;t as big as you think it is.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/dart/wiki/Contributing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/dart/wiki/Contributing</a>",1407246717

This type checks just fine. In fact this query will even work in Postgres; but it yields a syntax error from the database if you target SQL Server 2008 instead.<p>Then there&#x27;s the issue of the dialects letting you use features the RDBMS doesn&#x27;t support. For example you can build a merge statement regardless of which dialect is selected. If you were to select the Postgres dialect you&#x27;ll get an &quot;unsupported exception&quot; at runtime.<p>If a method is RDBMS specific (in practice) then why is it part of the generic API?<p>---<p>My biggest beef with all these SQL abstraction layers is that many of them claim to be &quot;write once, run anywhere.&quot; In practice I&#x27;ve just never seen that to be true.<p>I wish they would incorporate some sort of &quot;capabilities&quot; system that could run at compile time.

And most ORM only people I know overlook this part, which is a must for transactionality. Your data stay consistent other time.<p>Also, people tend to think querying with ORM are cool. They often query DB as random access record. However for me complex query are more like intersection, symmetric difference, union of records based on their joins. And SQL is so good at it.<p>ORM can have hook on transactions, making it possible to call a webservice on commit and rollback.<p>ORM can have mixins to help with having password handled carefully.<p>So, what is wrong at my opinion, is neither SQL nor ORM but the idea that only one is enough to learn.",1407244047

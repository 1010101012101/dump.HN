(The earth would have turned ~1500 miles under the orbiter by that point, so it would have to be aerodynamic enough to fly those 1500 miles as a plane.)<p>This crossrange requirement was what required the Shuttle to use the unusual delta-wing configuration.

1241620,comment,1239815,1240914,0,0,AlisdairO,,,"Fascinating - thanks for the detailed response, and that does make a lot of sense.<p>It seems that if string comparisons are the major cost, you could speed up collision handling on the hash table quite a bit by storing additional metadata.  Storing the size of the string, for example, would allow you to skip a lot of comparisons - you can do a simple size comparison prior to actually comparing characters.  This would also allow you to do slightly more funky string comparisons, such as comparing characters from the end first, or even starting at the middle, to skip common prefixes.<p>Alternatively, instead of storing the size you could store the computed hash value for each string, which would allow you to compare hash values rather than full strings.  The likelihood of a collision on a 32 bit hash value (say) is pretty low, so you'd mostly be avoiding extraneous string comparisons.  This would also speed up growing/shrinking the table quite a bit.  Have you tried these sorts of changes, and what (if any) difference do they make?<p>I can see that these optimisations merely reduce the cost of collisions rather than the baseline non-collision cost, and it definitely makes sense that tries require fewer operations.  What I wonder is whether, as you scale up the trie to very large datasets, the superiority of the trie tails off due to the memory latency?  Or are tries basically always superior in memory, due to their depth never getting all that large?<p>(To be clear, I don't mean to doubt your work on this subject, since you're clearly rather more knowledgeable than I am - I'm just interested :-) )",1270462383
1241619,comment,1240452,1240452,0,0,rfreytag,,,"I think this is actually an argument for more accessible markets.  Retail investing was not offering vehicles to the average investor who wanted to invest believing that house prices would fall.  I wondered to many professional and non-professional investors how t invest against the housing market to no avail.  If people had understood how to ""bet"" against house prices then I am confident the bubble would have deflated more gently and earlier.  The easiest retail position to take is a ""long"" purchase of an investment instrument.  What is needed is the knowledge of and retail accessibility to bubble-deflating investments.<p>How far should this go?  Anyone should be able to own and even construct derivatives.  Such a market would bring along a host of educational material and means to understand the provenance of your derivatives and the counter-party risk.  Obviously this accessibility and transparency would benefit professional derivative investors as the pool of clients, information, transparency, and alternative parties and views with which to trade expands.<p>But this is impossible as long as the notion of ""qualified investor"" exists.  If Greenspan and traditional economics has any hope of being correct then what is needed is to enlarge the pool of ""qualified investors"" to simply everyone.  We need not more regulation but less but for the requirement that the prospectus be accurate, intelligible,  and anyone that sells ""investments"" must do business with anyone has the purchase price.<p>Taleb says market-based black swans are becoming more common.

I started with $2000 and doubled it many times over to pay for tuition. But I read everything I could and watched my stocks religiously.<p>I would buy and sell every few days or weeks to make use out of every 5% gain or loss in the stock's value.<p>Yes, the fees (etrade at $20 a trade) were ridiculous. They might have cost me 25% of my gains but at the end of the day my gains were still up there. It's much cheaper to trade now.<p>If you have the time to invest then I would learn foreign exchange instead. You can have much more leverage there without much initial capital.

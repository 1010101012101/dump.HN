If once, over many years of following this strategy, it means your phone dies at an inopportune moment, was it worth the years of savings?<p>We spend energy all the time for convenience, and $2/year for not having to micromanage a device that's supposed to make life easier is a bargain.",1255452751

879466,comment,879213,879213,0,0,biggiesu,,,"Good article, but much more applicable for enterprise products vs. consumer.  The problem VCs have is that most of the time they need to figure out patterns by which to determine the potential of an early stage company, but most of the great companies don't fall into any pattern.  Only after the fact, when looking back, can you see a pattern (other than founders, which is why they put such an emphasis on team, cause team does matter and team is more easy to recognize than product fit).  By this criteria, twitter would be vitamin, facebook would be (be honest, has it been a burning desire for you to connect with long lost friends or have a social graph? not until you had it did you realize you needed it).  So if your product fails these criteria, it's not the end of the world.  But it is useful especially for products targeting enterprise customers.",1255452583

It's a vector graphics toolkit, a bit like Cairo, Quartz 2D or Java 2D. It uses a particular style of C++ - a mixture of template programming together with regular polymorphism - to build up a collection of rendering components. The components are almost Unix-like - you plug them together to build your customized rendering pipeline, and the C++ compiler's template logic takes care of making everything hardwired (or dynamic, if you choose to use the polymorphic components):<p><pre><code>  http://www.antigrain.com/

However, I would caution OP to consider the following two (which it sounds like he has, at least for item 2 below).<p>First, biggest reason to go over 5-10% + market salary: if you think he will bring in that much additional money.  Say you pay him $100k + 10%.  Suppose your current profit is $50k / year (you said you were mildly profitable).  If he ramps this profit from $50k to $200k, you're still ahead of the game.  Yes, it is possible: with only 1 founder, OP is stuck doing a lot of overhead work, which would take less time of a second guy.  Plus, there's:
2) The emotional support.  Fresh blood can definitely help the weariness and solitude of running your own company.  Sure, employee #2 may not bring in another $150k, but he could help you increase what you bring in due to more enthusiasm (and, more impt, quality of life).<p>If you ever want to take a vacation, you will need a second in command.  Higher percentage means more (emotional) ownership, so this guy is also less likely to treat it as another job.  He probably doesn't want to work for someone else ever again (a common thought), so he wants more ownership.",1255450692

How would eliminating the enforcement of cleanliness standards reduce illness?<p>I didn&#x27;t say that eliminating the enforcement of cleanliness standards would reduce illness, rather I said crushing the small farmer isn&#x27;t the answer and suggested that more small farms would reduce illness.<p>Example (from Michael Pollan&#x27;s excellent book &quot;The Omnivore&#x27;s Dilemna&quot;): FDA regulations that require slaughterhouses to have a private restroom reserved for the FDA inspector.<p>For a large multinational corporation processing tons of meat per day, that is a drop in the bucket. For a small slaughterhouse processing maybe a handful of cattle/week during peak slaughtering season, that&#x27;s a much more substantial cost.",1405184374

8025000,comment,8024799,8024799,13,0,x1798DE,,,"I think the criticisms on this site are fundamentally wrong-headed. The original motherfucking website is reflowable, lightweight text that conveys everything it needs to. Navigation doesn&#x27;t need to be &quot;fixed to the viewport&quot;, and lines don&#x27;t need to be 66 characters long.<p>If every website were designed like the &quot;motherfucking website&quot;, I could design a &quot;browsing theme&quot; where all lines were 66 characters long. If there were some navigation metadata in there, I could theme the browser to show that as a viewport at the top. I could change the aesthetics <i>to the user&#x27;s preference</i>.<p>Not that there&#x27;s anything that can be done about it from this equilibrium, but I think the problem is that people got it in their head that they should be able to control how users view their sites, and that&#x27;s wrong. If you consider markup to be metadata about how your data should be displayed, then you shouldn&#x27;t have to do any QA testing or cross-device testing, because the onus of design would be <i>on the browser</i>. You&#x27;d choose a browser that displays websites the way you like to see them. Everything would be automatically 100% cross-platform and accessible, because you&#x27;re not trying to use markup to force a specific way of viewing your site.<p>Honestly, the <i>hubris</i> of designers can be amazing. As if aesthetics is a universal. Maybe some people <i>prefer</i> 100 lines of text per line. Maybe some people want to zoom a mobile site. It&#x27;s so incredibly difficult to specifically create a single (or even adaptive) design that works for blind people, people with every different kind of colorblindness, people using every browser on the market on devices with vastly different screen sizes and resolutions, people with every kind of character set and a million different aesthetic preferences you&#x27;ve never even <i>thought</i> of. And yet it&#x27;s so easy to just put your content up there with markup suggestions about how it should be displayed and let users choose how they want to see it.

The most secure approaches that I&#x27;m aware of involve both locking down the systems to prevent unauthorized OS modifications (e.g. Chromebook, iOS, etc.), combined with a whitelisting of all applications or activities allowed on the system, and tracking of extensive audit logs on Windows to a remote server such that abnormal behavior can be detected quickly. Automatic updates are a must, though I&#x27;d rather certificate pinning were used given governments level exploits of Microsoft&#x27;s certificate (since revoked) to install spyware via Windows Update. Ultimately... How can you be so right to say 2014.07 is still insecure but then not acknowledge that security is system-specific? My definition of insecure activity may differ on a case by case basis, because security, ultimately, is made up of tradeoffs, restrictions and oversight.

Currently, &quot;successful&quot; AI systems are indded systems with a purpose: cheating some human judges into beliveing your a boy in a chat,  wining a Jeopardy game, detecting cats in video.  Well done.  But lame.  With a purpose you get working systems, but you don&#x27;t get what we expect when we say we want an AI.<p>If you defined the purpose to be to execute any order given. by a human, it would be very nice, but it still wouldn&#x27;t be enough.<p>Perhaps the purpose would be to find out why we built them?  In a way, it&#x27;s a paradoxical question, like whether God exists, or why we are here?  I guess it would do, as a purpose, to obtain the wanted AI.

He&#x27;s also maintained, for years, an extensive series of commentaries on current events: <a href=""http://www.iwallerstein.com/commentaries/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iwallerstein.com/commentaries/</a><p>There&#x27;s a book I read around the same time that I often recommend, &quot;The Political Economy of Third World Intervention&quot; by David Gibbs, which cites Wallerstein. It proposes a &quot;business conflict model&quot; of warmongering, and analyzes a shift in US military policy toward the Congo between the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. Basically the thesis is that war is no longer country versus country, but Multinational Corporate Conglomorate vs (MNC), and countries sway in alliance to various MNCs.<p>Its a good read from the perspective of the &quot;World System&quot;, the definition of which is a (global) economic system which transcends localized political systems. Prior to the 1500&#x27;s, most economic trade took place within a common nation/political regime, but starting around then, the &quot;modern&quot; world became a place of extensive economic trade across political boundaries.",1405180908

2729246,comment,2729070,2729181,1,0,dexen,,,"<i>> Why does government debt equal private assets?</i><p>Not that I fully agree with his assertion, but: Gov't debt usually takes form  of `bonds'. Such bonds are issued for fixed terms and traded on free market. Both private and institutional investors (including other countries) invest in bonds, thus <i>some</i> of gov't debt will normally be in hands of private investors.<p>Government bonds are considered highly secure and reliable means of investment, if somewhat low-yield. That allows the issuing country to rely on bonds for matching income to expenditures any time it needs to, at rather low cost. Should a country declare bankruptcy, or just near it, this instrument is much harder to use for the govt.<p>Consider having a look at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ascent_of_money"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ascent_of_money</a> which covers the topic pretty well.",1309859851

Contrasting that with a particular rich temple makes sense if, and only if, one has an efficient gold-into-anti-poverty engine.

In the absence of evidence that windfall taxation would be treated differently than India's other sources of revenue, which get redirected to corruption and cronyism with some regularity, I would be inclined to leave the gold in the ground.

Joining the war only when the USA was attacked. As spoils the USA has military bases in Germany, Italy, Japan, etc, and joint political control of much oil-rich and strategically important territory.<p>As I said, intent is key.

But this is self-serving - literally. To serve/save yourselves. If you could have safely driven the Germans into continental Europe and left them bottled there - harmless to you, you would have.<p>And as for receiving the least back from it, not only does the USA occupy incredibly rich land it won through deceit and conquest, but it has control of many valuable resources around the world that it has gained in 'rescuing' others, or has itself taken directly by force.<p>> And please explain to me our world 24-7-365 everyone/everywhere wiretapping program you referenced?<p>Which countries do you think you don't wiretap and otherwise spy on?<p>> Also in case you haven't noticed, PG/Y-Combinator are from the USA?<p>So?

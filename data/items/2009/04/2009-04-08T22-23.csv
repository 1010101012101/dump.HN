I was in elementary school during the whole pokemon phase, so about 8 years ago.<p>I sold pokemon cards on the playground. Now, you'd usually go to the corner store and pay $3-5 for a pack of cards. I had the idea when I was at an asian night market that I could buy a box of cards for a lot less (I think about $1.50 a pack) and then resell those.<p>So I started out just selling packs for $2.50 or $3, a bit below the regular stores with a decent return. Which was pretty awesome at the time. I sold about 2 full boxes then realized there was more money selling single cards.<p>So I bought another box and some card protector sleeves and started ripping open packs. I found a bunch of valuable cards that gathered over $10 each. In total I spent about $60 on supplies and made a bit over $450 in a 3 week span.<p>And then I got busted by a teacher who confiscated my earnings for a day and a binder of cards. I was told that if they caught me selling anything ever again I would be suspended.<p>I understand that they can't allow others to sell stuff to the students, but it really hurt my entrepreneurial spirit at the time.

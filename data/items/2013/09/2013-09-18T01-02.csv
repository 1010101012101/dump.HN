The normal price to get to work on the MRT is less than 1 USD.  So the difference between that and free isn&#x27;t worth it for me to alter my schedule.

6402994,comment,6402047,6402047,2,0,sytelus,,,"From Wikipedia:<p><i>Modularity is one measure of the structure of networks or graphs. It was designed to measure the strength of division of a network into modules (also called groups, clusters or communities). Networks with high modularity have dense connections between the nodes within modules but sparse connections between nodes in different modules. Modularity is often used in optimization methods for detecting community structure in networks. However, it has been shown that modularity suffers a resolution limit and, therefore, it is unable to detect small communities. Biological networks, including animal brains, exhibit a high degree of modularity. A 2013 paper shows that modularity in biological networks may have evolved due to selection pressures to reduce connection costs.</i><p>Paper on Modularity Maximization algo to identify communities in graph is at <a href=""http://www-scf.usc.edu/~gaurava/modularity.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-scf.usc.edu/~gaurava/modularity.pdf</a><p>There are many other ways to cluster the graph.",1379469570

If you can guess your opponent&#x27;s hand, you can bet just enough to make the pot odds just under their odds of winning, so that the rational thing for them to do (assuming they don&#x27;t know you&#x27;re bluffing) is to fold, while exposing yourself to minimal risk. A converse strategy works for getting people to call when you know that you have them beat.

This impact statement will be taken into consideration when sentencing, and is often directly referenced in the judge&#x27;s closing statement. Eg, &quot;the victim has experienced years of mental anguish and you show no remorse; I am therefore pronouncing the maximum allowable sentence&quot;.<p>So yes, the court very much does &quot;pander&quot; to emotions.

- Oracle - which is now closed source
- Open-ZFS - which will be now the official open source ZFS that all Open Source systems will use.<p>Unfortunately it will still be CDDL, since no one in that project has power to do it. This would require Oracle and all contributors to allow for changing the license.",1379468919

Imagine a (flawed, but fair) system in which, if an executive selectively failed to prosecute anyone for violating a law, then the law is nullified, just as (approximately) in the arena of trademark. An executive bound to enforce the law would result in more citizen/legislative/lobbying effort directed toward implementing better laws and fixing those that were broken or out of date.<p>In practice, executive (and judicial (and in general!)) discretion is important.

6402925,comment,6400455,6400455,2,0,graycat,,,"The line in the essay I liked best was:<p>> But there may be cases where a startup either
wouldn&#x27;t want to grow faster, or outside money
wouldn&#x27;t help them to, and if you&#x27;re one of them,
don&#x27;t raise money.<p>Having the essay earlier would have saved me a lot
of time and effort.  For my startup, I tried for a
long time to raise money, and as in the essay it was
a huge distraction from the real work.  Eventually,
at absurdly high cost in time and effort, I
concluded the more common half of what is in the
essay.<p>Since I wanted to try hard to crack the nut of fund
raising, I kept at the effort until I got some
decent understanding.<p>Also I had to conclude that VCs and I do projects
and project planning and evaluation in very
different ways.  Since it was quite a while ago that
I was 20 years old, and I&#x27;ve done a lot of projects
and seen a lot of business, I prefer my approaches
to project planning and evaluation.  Also, for my
project, my technical background, in applied
mathematics, is far above that of all but maybe 10
VCs in the country.  There is likely not a single VC
in the country who could understand the crucial core
of my project, some original applied math I derived,
and only a few VCs who could even direct a competent
review of that crucial core.  So, I just can&#x27;t be
impressed by what VCs think of the crucial core of
my project.  When I was fund raising, I wondered how
the VCs would evaluate my work; the answer is, they
wouldn&#x27;t!  So, they don&#x27;t have a clue about what
they are missing.<p>So, net, VCs will evaluate my project based on
<i>traction</i> which should mean that, for me, a solo
founder with meager <i>burn rate</i>, by the time a VC
wants to write a check, as in the quote above from
the essay, I will no longer be willing to accept
one.<p>After the fund raising effort, I settled on the line
in the essay I quoted above:  For me, and as often
in the essay, the VCs are just too much trouble to
work with to be worthwhile.  Yes, the VCs are
trouble in fund raising, but also the VCs will bring
Board overhead, more time/money with lawyers and
accountants, and, then, in case of the success they
want, an IPO with all the Wall Street and SEC
nonsense.  Handling all that would be a full time
job for me, the CEO of my company; that&#x27;s not the
kind of work I want to do; and my hands would be
taken from actually building and running my company.<p>I see another point:  In the US, businesses are
started and succeed coast to coast in big cities
down to crossroads by solo founders by the millions
each year.  Such a business might be a pizza shop,
auto repair shop, landscaping service, big
truck/little truck business, etc.<p>My startup, with me as solo founder, is in
<i>information technology</i> (IT) which should be a huge
advantage:  E.g., my first server farm will cost
less than the truck and lawn mower of the guys who
cut grass in my neighborhood, and the Internet
connection I need will cost less than $100 a month.
Moreover if I half fill the Internet connection,
then from simple arithmetic my revenue and earnings
in one year will be quite comparable with funds from
a Series A.<p>So I just view my <i>startup</i> as a one person pizza
shop but with some big advantages from IT; e.g., a
pizza shop owner needs to be in the shop for each
dollar made, and my server farm can be making money
while I sleep.<p>For PG&#x27;s definition of a <i>startup</i> in terms of very
rapid growth, so rapid that VC funds become
important, that&#x27;s not important to me.  I need a
nice business; I don&#x27;t have to shoot for another
Google and wouldn&#x27;t want to manage anything that big
anyway.<p>A recent remark of Mark Andreessen is that there are
only about 15 startups a year that deserve a Series
A.  So, the essay is talking about only about 15
startups a year and, thus, I am not disappointed the
essay is not talking about my startup.<p>The VCs and I will have to disagree on how to plan,
evaluate, start, and build a company.  If I am
successful, then likely that disagreement will have
been a big part of my success.<p>The VCs remind me of the Mother Goose story <i>The
Little Red Hen</i> when she could get help only when
she had fragrant, hot loaves of bread coming out of
the oven and customers lining up to buy and no
longer needed any help.<p>For me, one really serious turnoff of VCs is that,
since they have really no chance of understanding
the crucial core of my business or how I do
projects, no way would I want to report to a Board
with VCs.  Vinod Khosla has some recent remarks on
how <i>helpful</i> Board VCs are!<p>Another big turnoff of VCs is that, as reported on
Fred Wilson&#x27;s blog, on average over the past 10
years, the VC ROI has been poor.  Net, VCs do not
have a lot of credibility in business.<p>Another big turnoff is that too many VCs were not
STEM majors and have written little to no code.<p>Another big turnoff is that my startup, as is
recommended for startups, is doing work that is new;
well, there is some education for how to work
effectively with things that are new, a Ph.D.
degree; I have an appropriate one from a famous
research university, and nearly no VCs do.  I will
have a tough time viewing a VC as a helpful
colleague in the crucial core of my business.",1379468115

Not so! Web development and CS are different enough that you can start learning the former without having a strong base in the latter.&quot;</i><p>This is very true, and I&#x27;m gonna go a bit further based on my own experience: if you dream of being a coder, developer, or web designer, and you&#x27;re starting or planning to start a Computer Science degree, you need to back up and reconsider. I can&#x27;t speak for all degree programs, but I spent years of my life and tens of thousands of dollars getting a CS degree that was practically <i>worthless</i> for doing what I wanted to do with my life. By the end of it, I knew a lot of interesting theory--some fascinating details about electrical engineering, compiler and processor design, algorithmic complexity, and so forth--and I couldn&#x27;t begin to design the most basic web or desktop application.<p>My most successful classmates used the degree program as an opportunity to meet and network with like-minded people and learned marketable skills on their own time. I&#x27;d&#x27;ve done the same if I&#x27;d known I needed to. Instead I trusted my advisors, did the homework, and spent my spare time on other things.

Even if it does change your perspective, that does not determine whether or not harsher punishment of the criminal will help you - people often wish things that has different effect than they believe it will have. There is also to my knowledge little indication that e.g. most Norwegian victims of crime cry out for drastically harsher punishments, despite sentences that in the US would often be slammed as slaps on the wrist, so it is by no means given that victims of crime will feel an urge for harsh punishment; that seems to be more culturally specific.<p>> practically all young parents i know turned around their stance on punishment once they thought about someone maiming/hurting their kids.<p>I have a four year old son, and though the thought of anyone harming him is one of the worst things I could imagine, it has not changed my stance on punishment at all. I am sure I would feel an urge to kill someone who harmed him; at the same time I am very much aware how little my urges reflect my long term emotions, and how often they will temporarily be out of step with what I consider moral once I have had a chance to calm down.<p>There is a reason why we do not let the victims judge or sentence.",1379467716

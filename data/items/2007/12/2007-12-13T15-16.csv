Building a secure system is a hard problem and even if you build the best system few people can judge how well your doing.  You could market it as ""The only 4096 bit system"" but you end up with a tiny market segment.<p>I would suggest starting with a secure chat system with good logging options.  That way you can reasonably target teenagers, bankers and the truly paranoid.  And you don't need a huge backup infrastructure or a 50$ / year price tag to compete.",1197561465

Bare in mind that this was a part-time/evening project. Had I done it full-time my guess is that it wouldn't have taken more than 1,5 weeks to complete.<p>As for your suggestions you are spot on. Many people have asked for mouse interaction. And the reflection thing would be cool but I am not sure if it is feasible... I'll have to check.",1197561383

89173,comment,89055,89055,0,0,imgabe,,,"Each individual mainstream user might have a finite number of needs, but the number of needs of users in aggregate is effectively infinite. I agree that I'd rather use 5-10 great apps than 40-50 marginally useful apps, but why do you think the 5-10 apps you find most useful would be the same 5-10 apps someone else does? No one webapp has to appeal to the entire market to be successful, it just has to appeal to enough users to provide an income to cover its costs.<p>This reminds me of Joel Spolsky's take on the 80/20 bloatware myth. The idea being that bloated programs like Word are bad because 80% of the users only use 20% of the features. But they don't all use the same 20% is the problem, so you can't just remove 80% of the features without pissing off a sizable group of people. I think the same applies to web apps. Nobody needs every one of them, but the right set of web apps for any given person probably isn't identical to anyone else's.",1197560494

89165,comment,89055,89164,0,0,hhm,,,"Sorry if I didn't express myself correctly. I'm not a native English speaker.<p>I say: you can have a need, but you can have not enough money to pay for a solution to that need. For example, you can say that as there is so much poverty, there is a big need for food so there is a big market for food right? But probably, the sector that is suffering poverty wouldn't make an interesting market, as would not have money to pay for the food you might offer to it.<p>That's an exaggeration, but the same can happen with other stuff. There are lots of human needs you can point to, but the segments that would pay for solutions to these needs are, as I think, more limited, for many reasons. Maybe your solution is expensive for them, maybe they don't want to use credit cards online, etc...<p>About ""too much money""... that was where my ""non-native"" English came along. I meant: maybe the people that have the needs have not enough resources (money) to buy your product/service, making that an uninteresting market despite being an unattended need. I was not saying you can have ""too much money"".",1197558262

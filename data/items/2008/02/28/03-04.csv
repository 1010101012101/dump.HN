You've got something of a stream of consciousness style going on; your posts are longer than most here. My advice is to try and make your posts more concise. If they were shorter, people would be more likely to take the time to reply rather than just downmod you.",1204170296

125235,comment,125093,125218,0,0,curi,,,"Regarding that link, in the ""background essay"":<p>The first sentence misuses the word ""revolutionary"".<p>The second sentence misuses the term ""all aspects"".<p>The third sentence misquotes the general position of string theorists (I think) by misusing the term ""explanation"". Either way, it's making a reductionist mistake.<p>The fourth sentence (second paragraph) suggests that the biggest obstacle to acceptance of string theory is that it's weird, not whether it's true. This is false. If there was no case that string theory were true, then it's adherents would give it up, and it would never be able to gain acceptance.<p>The fifth sentence misuses the word ""detect"".<p>The sixth sentence (third paragraph), which I think was your point, is ... well let's see how they support it in the remaining sentences.<p>The seventh sentence makes both inductivist and justificationist mistakes before the semi-colon. Then misuses the word ""suggests"" after the semi-colon.<p>The eighth sentence restates the claim from the sixth.<p>The ninth (last) sentence badly misuses the word ""explains"" and the term ""scientifically valid"". It's also terrible English.",1204169362
125233,comment,123509,125228,0,0,NSX2,,,"But I get downmodded no matter what.  It seems like there's a conspiracy to make sure I never get above mid-50s.  Heck, I think if I add all the 30-to-50 variances I'd be up to at least 500 by now.  Okay.  Fine.  Um, ""Me too.  I agree.  What that guy said reminds me of an article by Paul Graham ... BTW, I was using all these cool new startup apps, then I found out they were all started by this incubator, Y Combinator, which just happened to be run by the guy who wrote most of my favorite articles on the whole wide internet, Paul Graham.  Did I mention I can't wait for someone to do a mashup of Xobni and RescueTime and Reddit?  Also, a random thought occurred to me: without Viaweb, Yahoo would probably never have gotten off the ground.  Also, last, I would upmod everybody if only I could, especially pg and rms.  Have I mentioned how clean, fresh and well-thought out the design of Hacker News is?  If only all forums were this elegant.  There!  Can I please have a few extra points now?  My dream is to someday break the magical (for me) ""60 barrier"".  I've heard tales.  I believe it's possible, somehow, someway.  I love all you guys, even the band of down-modding ninjas tracking my every move.  May you all have many buyout offers from Google and Microsoft, but enough customers to be able to turn them down and go on to bigger, better things.<p>Now watch this get downmodded.",1204169272

125219,comment,125158,125168,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I think you're right that there's going to be (is?) a Rails ""backlash"", but I disagree that it has anything to do with DHH or his personality. (What, you think Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, and Steve Ballmer are humble and self-effacing?) It's just the backside of the hype cycle.<p>Rails is no longer as young and hot as it used to be, and the fanboys and the media will move on to something else. Because Rails was the subject of such breathless hype from the Silver Bullet crowd, the ""backlash"" meme will probably get considerable media play as well. Nobody is more bitter than a frustrated seeker of Silver Bullets.<p>Meanwhile, Rails and Merb and jRuby and other Ruby-based tools will continue to slowly improve, as such tools generally do.<p>You can argue over whether or not such hype cycles are useful in the long term. They certainly didn't hurt Java.",1204167641

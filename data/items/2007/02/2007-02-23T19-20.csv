A lot of it extends beyond what many of us are focused on at the moment (just building a truly meaningful product), though it's probably good to keep this in sights.<p>Read it and saved it for (near) future reference... ;)",1172260413

If you have some nice keys : above hand writing. With nowadays mobile phone : equal or above T9.<p>You will be excited if I can show you the thing face to face. I have no pictures right now (their are not completely finished) as we are in early stage of  developing the stuff. But we will provide soon nice ppt.<p>Thanks for your attention and keep a eye upon the site.",1172260169
741,comment,712,712,0,0,danielha,,,"As far as implementing basic features go, my rule of thumb is this:<p>If someone is using your site and he feels he should be able to intuitively accomplish something, it should be there. These features should feel as little as &#34;features&#34; as possible. They should be so ingrained as for the user to feel that it just naturally exists.",1172259972

738,comment,732,732,0,0,danielha,,,"There are a lot of services I use because, in addition to being useful and convenient, they are free.<p>Despite how much I may gain in productivity or enjoyment from a service, it may stop being so as convenient or approachable when I have to grab my credit card to check it out. But that said, if Google Calendar, Flickr, or Wordpress became pay only, I probably would take the time to sign up for a subscription account.<p>For those of you entrepreneurs with non-pay business models: Would a user want to continue using your service or product if you began a mandatory charge? How about those of you who already plan to charge: Would your user-base increase x-fold if you decided to make it free?<p>I think these might be some interesting questions to ponder when you're still in the early stages.",1172259632

730,comment,721,721,0,0,danielha,,,"If you can't get someone else excited about your product, then you might be approaching it the wrong way. But there are many reasons why VCs might not want to get their hands in. They might deem it as a me-too or as a novelty not worth exploring. But there's no way they can completely estimate the web community. If you have a firm belief that you offer something someone else does not, or you implement it better, do it. Fund it yourself. The true reason you should give up on your idea is if you cannot sell it to yourself anymore.",1172258880
729,comment,707,707,0,0,danielha,,,"Coulton's stuff is great. And although this is one of my favorites, it's important to remember that you don't HAVE to be a code monkey if you're a software engineer. I think a lot of students are getting discouraged from the computer science field because they don't want to be pre-Matrix Neo or stuck in the daily grind from Office Space. <p>You definitely can end up in that situation but if you're smart and passionate, you won't. Being a developer in a startup is an example of that. If you love what you're working on and you're contributing to its potential, you're not going to be that monkey. <p>Or if there's nothing already out there where you can apply this passion, take the entrepreneurial route. That's likely why we're all here on this site to begin with. :)",1172258261

336933,comment,336153,336352,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"That's an interesting thought. You're probably right. I imagine doubling the number of terrorists required probably more than doubles the chance of them getting caught. Might be exponential.<p>Unfortunately, one ziploc bag full of plastic explosive is probably more than enough to blast a hole in the side of a plane. And one of those beer belly things I would think could take a whole plane out.",1224394593
336932,comment,336556,336887,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"The existence of some facets of the financial system that were not controlled by the state hardly implies that more state control would have stopped the current crisis. Nor does it imply that less state control would have stopped it. However, I have yet to hear a single new regulation that did not require 20/20 foresight that we could have pursued to avert the credit collapse that we have recently suffered.<p>Our economy is very mixed. Large portions of private money, semi-private money, and government money were sloshing about in the financial sector prior to the credit crisis. Blaming ""libertarianism"" or ""government"" for it is silly. Deeper analysis and more careful thought is needed in dissecting the lessons from recent events in the market. Causal links must be proposed and evaluated.<p>Also, I personally don't claim that libertarianism can only work in an unadulterated form. I think rather free markets work pretty damn well now, and that most of them would work better without tinkering from central planners. I don't think you could design an economic order without macroeconomic fluctuations, free or planned. I also don't think any regulator will be smart enough to design an optimal regulation scheme, or that one necessarily exists for a dynamic economy.",1224394505

I guess that would first require understanding PG's essay, which he clearly didn't. In fact, nothing he said even seems to contradict PG's thesis, which was (as I read it) that even though now isn't the best time in history, it's still +EV, and waiting is -EV.",1224394401

336927,comment,336556,336850,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"By the way, there aren't that many libertarian anarchists that have written popular works. The only one I can think of besides David is Murray Rothbard, who wrote ""For a New Liberty"" detailing his anarchist vision. It's available in its entirety online. However, he is not a utilitarian, and I don't remember Murray being as convincing as David.<p>As the libertarian movement has grown it has become more ideologically diverse and more moderate on average. There are few fire-breathing anarchists around any more (David is not a ""fire-breating anarchist"". Murray was.).",1224394007

The Communist party offered just one bitter pill. The two Capitalist parties offer a choice of two placebos. The latest innovation is the photo finish election, where each party buys 50% of the vote, and the result is pulled out of statistical noise, like a rabbit out of a hat.</i><p>Ok, I'm pretty sure this was a joke/satire/etc but I really liked this bit.

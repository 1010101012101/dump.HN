It ends up in grandma's inbox in the best possible way.<p>Embarrassingly, the camera-to-internet part of the chain is only seamless on Windows right now.  It's a little more manual on Linux and OSX.  Still, I'm questioning now whether it's another improvement that the site needs, or if it's marketing.<p>There are even photo frames that support media RSS, so the chain to grandma doesn't have to involve email.  I actually give two Media RSS feeds--one text+photos, one photos only.<p>Further, if grandma is comfortable clicking buttons on web pages, she can take over from mom and dad the job of picking good pictures from among many that were taken.  Mom or dad just needs to turn on the option.",1203051598

I know how hard it is and how scary it is (we all set aside really lucrative jobs).  I agree with you about the marriage analogy.<p>But, sticking with that analogy-- having bad spouses in your past is a pretty lousy reason to swear off of dating. ;-)",1203051480

We are planning to meet in a few weeks...if all goes well I'll have a new member on the team that seems as enthusiastic as I am about the project.<p>I like what you said exploratory programming because with a new cofounder I can sit down and say, ""look this is what I've found will work, this needs help, this needs someone to just start outright, and do you have any ideas how the hell to make this work.""  Thanks for replying...I'm glad you did.",1203051198

116302,comment,116258,116291,0,0,brlewis,,,"Good point on the TBD.  I've changed it.<p>I'm actually not worried about Flickr.  I'm gunning for a much larger competitor: people's hard drives.  Flickr is a perfectly fine social network for photography enthusiasts.  For normal people who want to share their doings, I've made something clearly better, in ways you can see at a glance.  Flickr is a grid.  OurDoings is an illustrated story.  The only problem I expect to encounter related to Flickr is people getting the expectation that your photos won't be organized unless you put effort into it.<p>That said, your point about MSFT is a good one.  Perhaps the time is now to make a Flickr import tool.",1203050912
116301,comment,116169,116296,0,0,edw519,,,"Yes, I didn't even get that far.  This may be the biggest hurdle.  Of all the hackers I've ever met, I wouldn't even approach 99%.  I've seen their work.<p>I know 2 rock stars who are local and I've worked with before that I would love to be with now.  One is laid up after a horrible motorcycle accident and the other is going through a nasty divorce.  Lunch and phone calls, yes.  Co-founders, no.<p>Interestingly enough, I'm corresponding off-line with several people from this board.  Who knows, maybe that will lead somewhere.<p>Willie Sutton robbed banks because ""that's where the money is"".  Do you think if he was a lonely hacker, he'd be here now?",1203050817
116300,comment,116258,116258,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I don't think going viral works as well with busy parents as it does with teens and college students.<p>If you want to focus on busy parents, I think working this from a different angle would work best. If your service has any special features that you feel are newsworthy, you could try submitting it to local newspapers (used by busy parents much more than the internet still).<p>Another angle to consider: What if you could partner with a camera manufacturer to bundle a client-side program that integrated with your site? If you could convince a manufacturer that your service is worth partnering with, you will see a tremendous amount of growth and revenue (if things are done right).<p>I think in order to successfully market to busy parents, you have to be a seamless link in the chain that links the picture from the moment it's taken to the moment is arrives in grandma's inbox (which represents what the majority of busy parents want to do with their photos - that and archiving). One product I've seen that has this in mind is a wifi-enabled SD card that automatically sent pictures to your network when it was in range. Your service is the next link - the one that brings the images from the computer to the internet, and even to grandma's inbox. Keep that in mind as you go forward and I think you'll do well.",1203050777

Even if you don't like them all you can make them optional.  It just doesn't seem like you have a lot to loose and only stand to gain a great deal in this.   His work will ""make the pie bigger"" so to speak, raise your valuation in the end.",1203050535

116296,comment,116169,116293,0,0,ph0rque,,,"You said it much more elegantly than I could. To add to reasons why it's hard to find a co-founder, it's harder to find a hacker co-founder when you've just started on the path to hackerdom, as is my case.",1203050204

116294,comment,116258,116280,0,0,brlewis,,,"What you're saying is true, but not simple.  Suppose I'm providing a shoe-shine service.  I understand my customers well and make every improvement I can think of, but still don't generate excitement.  How do I tell if (1) the next improvement will lead to the tipping point or (2) no improvement will generate excitement until I target a different set of people more likely to get excited about shoe shining or (3) Nobody else is as excited about shoe shines as I am, and to generate excitement I need to take my service in a different direction?  There are three possible paths.  Which one leads to making something great?",1203049865
116293,comment,116169,116221,0,0,edw519,,,"You can add:<p>4) The guy is cautious because he has been burnt before.  Every cofounder he has had has in previous ventures has either: failed to fully commit, failed to perform, reneged on their agreement, suffered personal tragedy, or died.<p>Just because someone doesn't have a co-founder doesn't mean that it must be 1, 2, or 3.  Personally, I'm tired of hearing #1 - I've always thought it was without logic.<p>And don't forget - it's a lot easier to find co-founders when you're still in school with like minded people with time on their hands.  Things get a lot tougher when your peers (if you can find any) have families and mortgages.  Not being able to miss a paycheck is a tough hurdle to overcome.<p>Finding a co-founder is more like getting married than dating.  I'd much rather be alone than be with the wrong person.  I'll either find the right person or launch alone.  In the meantime, I keep working.<p>If you have a good team, consider yourself very fortunate!  You've already completed a hurdle that others struggle with through no fault of their own.  So they keep on working and reaching out to groups like this.

116291,comment,116258,116258,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I bookmarked your site and may get around to trying it sometime, although I may have almost as little time as a new parent. :)<p>Quick thoughts, no intelligence guaranteed:<p>Your pricing plans are organized backwards. Click the link, glance at the leftmost column where the cheap option always is, see ""$52"", have a 500-millisecond heart attack. Then keep reading and notice that it <i>does</i> get cheaper. Great! Except that the damage has been done: the $52 sticks in my brain. Not good.<p>$52 is too much to quote. Especially with your wacky (nifty?) ""pay for what you use"" plan. If you have that plan, use it! Quote a price per picture! Or, if that's too late-night-infomercial a tactic for you, quote a price per 250 pictures, which is conveniently about $26. (Price of a 1 year Flickr Pro account with <i>unlimited</i> pictures: $25. Unless I'm missing something. If I am missing something your site needs to explain it to me or I'm just going to buy Flickr.)<p>""TBD"" is bad. Flickr doesn't give me any of this ""TBD"". I can tell exactly what the limits of my free account are. You should pick a number and put it there... having ""TBD"" there gives the subliminal impression that you're a newb and haven't figured it out yet. :)<p>You have a hard row to hoe. Flickr has the mindshare, they've got the network effect, they've got deep pockets in the form of a giant corporate owner who may soon be sold to an even larger corporate owner. You might consider positioning yourself as the perfect place to move to when you get sick of having your Flickr photos owned by Microsoft. I'm only half joking. How's your Flickr import tool? :)<p>Finally, if you have good photo support for bloggers but can't get the bloggers to move to you, can you move to them? Can you take any small bites of Photobucket's market? Is there any point in a Facebook app? (Doubtful, but what do I know?) A plugin that lets you embed slideshows into a Blogger/Livejournal/MySpace/??? page?",1203049627

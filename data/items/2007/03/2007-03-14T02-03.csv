4050,comment,4049,4049,0,0,amichail,,,"Why try to guess what many people would want? Let them tell you more directly via a service for collaborative startup specification. Unlike implementation, specification -- at least at an informal level -- can be done by pretty well anyone.  Of course, you will need to provide some way to end up with a coherent spec from all those user contributions. But if something like wikipedia can produce stellar results, then why not this?<p>And when you start working on something, why not keep all those people up to date with your progress? They would probably be very eager to see what you are doing with their spec contributions.  And they may evolve the spec over time, again, in a collaborative way.<p>When your startup is ready to launch, you will then have all those people ready to try it out and tell their friends.",1173839819

4041,comment,3851,3851,0,0,pashle,,,"This one comes from Paul Graham, from 'How To Start A Startup':<p>""What you should do in college is work on your own projects. Hackers should do this even if they don't plan to start startups, because it's the only real way to learn how to program. In some cases you may collaborate with other students, and this is the best way to get to know good hackers. The project may even grow into a startup. But once again, I wouldn't aim too directly at either target. Don't force things; just work on stuff you like with people you like.""<p>Granted, it's targeted towards a college student (which I am), there's an underlying principle that can be applied to most any case you might face. Just do projects with people you like. Too simple.",1173837670

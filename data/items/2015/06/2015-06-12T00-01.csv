They don&#x27;t care about what postgres or EC2 or whatever can do, it&#x27;s all about not doing anything that someone can point a finger at you for later.  Nobody ever got fired for choosing IBM, Oracle or Microsoft. Also, companies that supply software to corps also supply something that&#x27;s probably more valuable than the software itself. Support & Maintenance agreements. The fact that if anything goes wrong they can call up a phone number and immediately have a consultant($200+/hr) show up at the corp&#x27;s location and troubleshoot the problem is a lot of accountability they don&#x27;t have to directly absorb. There&#x27;s also PCI compliance and just general fear of new things.<p>Accountability/blame is the name of the game. You want that value for yourself to be zero unless you get privileged info that the project has succeeded before everyone else finds out, in which case you then scramble to get your name on any documents or email chains related to said project so you can claim it was all due to your planning & decision-making.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this happen several times and was personally burned hard by people I thought were my friends back in 2006. I&#x27;m still bitter about it. I will not let that happen to me again. And I know it happened because I didn&#x27;t properly document what I was doing and why. Or maybe, I just shouldn&#x27;t have done it at all and just sit back and watch everyone else panic and burn.... whatever. It was my first job out of college, I was naive.",1434070688

9703366,comment,9702372,9703264,0,0,StevePerkins,,,"Cassandra is a distributed database that easily scales more or less to infinity.  As you add more nodes to a cluster, it automatically redistributes data throughout the cluster.  It &quot;just works&quot;, and that&#x27;s pretty exciting.  So Cassandra at the moment seems to be enjoying a bit of the hype cycle that MongoDB enjoyed 5 or 6 years ago.  It&#x27;s the thing that everyone wants to try out and get onto their resume at the moment.<p>However, like all &quot;NoSQL&quot; databases, the trade-offs come with the usual severe limitations (e.g. no joins, no foreign keys, no transactions in the usual sense of the term, eventual consistency, etc).  Curious people diving into Cassandra (or most NoSQL databases for that matter) typically have zero understanding of these trade-offs at first, and think that they will be easier to work with.  It isn&#x27;t, and it isn&#x27;t supposed to be.  It&#x27;s <i>harder</i> to work with, and has <i>fewer</i> features, because that&#x27;s the trade-off you&#x27;re making for scalability.  There&#x27;s little reason to use it if you don&#x27;t need to scale like that.<p>So, curiosity and RDD (&quot;resume-driven development&quot;) aside, I don&#x27;t think there are many situations in which one would be choosing from Cassandra or MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL.  If you are working with multiple terabytes or more of data, then there is seldom a good reason to consider a relational database.  If you are working with less than a terabyte of data, then there is seldom a good reason to consider anything OTHER than a relational database.  I just don&#x27;t see much overlap in which these technologies seriously compete against each other.",1434069987

Not a big chain or online or anything, just one where I could walk in, sit down and talk to the guy about general components, pick all the pieces I wanted and then have them order them in and build them.<p>Build quality was great, he did a really good job with the cabling, I got all the boxes/manuals/extra parts.  Have no complaints.<p>I&#x27;ve done some upgrades to that machine myself over time (RAM, graphics card, PSU, a drive change).  PC assembly has gotten incredibly easier than it was in the past.  It&#x27;s the little touches.  I notice that tolerance on cases are a lot better these days (things tend to align much more easily than they used to).  PCI-E slots are a lot easier to put cards into than the older ones.  RAM sticks generally have heat-spreaders on them, so you don&#x27;t have to worry as much about handling them as you used to.  Drive cables are easier (cabling in general is easier as most things are keyed these days), thumbscrews are almost ubiquitous, as are easily removable drive bays.<p>The only thing I still get nervous about is CPUs and their heatsinks.  I haven&#x27;t fitted a CPU in a long time and a mate of mine did my heatsink replacement for me.<p>All that said, I&#x27;d still pay someone money to assemble my PC from scratch.

A one-stop solution is a powerful sales pitch.<p>2. They have a massive existing install base within the Fortune 500, which spend amounts of money that the average hacker just can&#x27;t grasp. Somebody that I know very recently worked on an enterprise project to create more-or-less a web page that had a $1,000,000 budget. Oracle is not asking for unreasonable amounts of money, by enterprise standards.<p>3. Companies value safety over risk, and Oracle has a long track record at the executive level of providing safety. The mindset goes something like: Postgres might be good enough for Imgur or Joe Bob&#x27;s Bait Shack And Social Network, but neither of those is a bank, healthcare provider, or an entity capable of ordering an air strike. Oracle is telling the story their customers want to hear.<p>4. Because Oracle has such a large install base and so many success stories at the enterprise level, they are one of a very few number of default choices that an enterprise will make. They have spent <i>decades</i> building up sales momentum.<p>Business decisions usually have very little do to with the underlaying technology.",1434068100

Both have very high concentrations of bacteria, and require refrigeration. These are expensive, and typically used if you&#x27;re trying to fix some condition. I make sure I always have a bottle of either stocked, and take it only if I feel I need to.<p>For day-to-day use, the following work great: Culturelle and Jarrow Formulas S. Boulardii. They&#x27;re reasonably priced, don&#x27;t require refrigeration, and the effects are noticeable in a day. I typically take a capsule of each twice a day (morning/night.)<p>Finally, make sure you get digestive enzyme supplements and take them religiously with meals that are hard on the digestive system (e.g., meat.) Twinlab Super Enzymes are what I typically get.<p>In general, the key effects I&#x27;ve noticed are: much improved digestion, lower anxiety, corrects GI issues, improvements in skin and oral health, and simply a better overall sense of well-being.<p>What&#x27;s particularly cool is if you take them with foods that you love but typically upset you (burgers, pizza, other greasy stuff), extra doses of these probiotics right after the meals (along with the digestive enzymes) completely eliminate negative aftereffects.<p>Good probiotics are incredible, and I wish more doctors better understood them.

  breathe life into it, if he makes one hell of a pivot away

  too confusing to use for most [2] and lacking an identity

  Bonus reason : Twitter has gone through 5 product heads

Block a server? They move the server. Seize a domain? Users can edit their host files (or get a new domain). Block an IP address or IP range? People will set up mirrors. The average person (and for that matter, politician) are seemingly unaware of this and waste a lot of time and money forming non-solutions. In some cases I&#x27;m actually supportive of B occurring due to the Streisand Effect. Their attempts at censoring information ends up spreading the message further and gives it a microphone and limelight in an increasing number of cases.",1434067428

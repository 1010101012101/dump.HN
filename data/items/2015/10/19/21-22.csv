Each remotely capable school will find a way to game the system and get qualified. You&#x27;re really screwed if you go to a school that cannot qualify, which would likely include most of the students who need this help the most. The system is still money chasing money.<p>The only way this works is through public education, where the K-12 system is tightly coupled with an elite public university system, and public policy can drive both into a tight partnership. There&#x27;s a system somewhat like this in California called TAG; any student who signs up and makes grades in community college can usually get guaranteed entry into a UC. It only works because the California community colleges are required to teach all &quot;transfer courses&quot; at the UC level in terms of content, etc. It might be possible to extend this kind of guaranteed enrollment down to K-12.",1445291832

Multiply that by 5, 10, or 20 traffic lights on a journey and an extra minute at each one can add up.  So people have incentive to run the light and shave the 30 seconds or a minute.  But then when people run the light, it slows down the cross-road who has to wait extra for the road to clear, despite it being &quot;their turn&quot;.  So then people on that side have an incentive to run the light, because they got wrongfully cutoff by the arbitrariness and the other jerks running the light first.  Rinse and repeat for a few cycles and it&#x27;s easy to see that this is not a good situation.<p>Traffic circles on the other hand don&#x27;t suffer from this as there isn&#x27;t arbitrariness on such a &#x27;long&#x27; timescale.  If you have to wait for a couple of extra cars it&#x27;s only a few seconds, versus a minute or so.  Because it&#x27;s just a couple of seconds, people have less to lose and are more inclined to be nice.

Worse than that though is stuff like hitting &quot;enter&quot; on the keyboard – all sorts of crazy stuff happens (new <span> tags being added, nothing consistent between browsers, generally doesn&#x27;t do what you want). We came to the same solution the guys at Basecamp have: you generally can&#x27;t trust the browser to get you from state A -> B and have to do it yourself.<p>Probably the hardest thing to do is handle copying and pasting, partly because most browsers give you very little control over this, so you have to resort to terrible hacks. You also have to decide how much of the formatting in the clipboard item was &quot;intentional&quot; and how much should be cleaned. I see if you copy/paste just a word from within Trix, it pastes it as a whole block with the block&#x27;s formatting around it. I suspect this may surprise many users who expect it just to copy the word (the inline bit, not the block around it in editor parlance). Once you start going down this rabbit hole, you end up having to do things like take one DOM tree and recursively merge the &quot;edges&quot; with the adjacent trees to get it to behave as the user expects. I think we do a pretty decent job with Squire, but I&#x27;m sure there are still more edge cases we haven&#x27;t covered.",1445290758

The article doesn&#x27;t seem to identify any extra special sauce. It points out that geared turbofans have been used on an airliner in the past, and identifies some design trade-offs. &quot;there may be a performance penalty, marked by slower cruise speeds for the same thrust setting, possibly slower max cruise speeds, slower green dot (best L/D speed),  slightly shallower climbs, and possibly degraded single-engine performance. The single engine performance difference is expected to be the most prominent, with a possibly larger yaw, and a definitely reduced climb gradient, consequently lowering obstacle clearances.&quot;<p>My impression based on just reading that article is that, rather than a technological breakthrough enabling the geared approach, Pratt and Whitney have explored a rather neglected area of the design space, to arrive at a more efficient, lower noise engine with slightly worse performance in some other respects. And had to conquer numerous &#x27;ordinary&#x27; engineering challenges to make it work.",1445290671

10415866,comment,10414294,10414294,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"Wow, that&#x27;s a tough one on many fronts.  As someone mentioned, the change in UI when Office 2007 came out was more painful than most care to admit.  I personally went from feeling like a power user to a complete moron crying like a little baby.  Horrible move on Microsoft&#x27;s part.  Not sure we&#x27;ve gained anything at all.  But, now years later, it is what it is.<p>Then there&#x27;s &quot;Office as a Tool&quot;, which, to me, means mostly Excel.<p>Another big huge part of the MS ecosystem, at least for us, is the fact that you can automate and create custom solutions using VBA (or Python).  I don&#x27;t have any data to indicate this is commonplace but I&#x27;d like to think large companies have such things as highly customize Excel spreadsheets doing all kinds of interesting stuff.<p>As an example, we developed an Excel application to design Helmholtz resonators for acoustic treatment of mixing rooms and high-end movie projection rooms.  It would calculate various room resonant modes, use a database of materials to determine damping across the desired frequency ranges and spit out Helmholtz resonator build parameters for low to mid-range acoustical treatment.  It worked like a charm and could be installed and loaded by anyone with Excel.<p>Yet another tool was used to simulate FIFO timing for a frame buffer to be implemented within a Xilinx FPGA for an image processing application.  It would allow faster verification of various parameters than running a Verilog simulation and spit out a bunch of Verilog code based on results.<p>Another tool was a really neat state machine generator for embedded systems using multi-line text LCD displays for a menu.  You could build the menu in Excel, click a few buttons and out would come a full state machine with callback function definitions for full navigation through a menu as well as dealing with screens where user adjustments could happen (think &quot;volume up&quot;, &quot;volume down&quot;, &quot;set temperature&quot;, etc.).  If you&#x27;ve ever written and maintained LCD menu code for an embedded system you can appreciate the advantage of entering your menu into Excel and having cut-and-paste C code you can paste into your Keil compiler (or whatever).<p>Another tool was created to help design Power Distribution Systems (PDS) for high speed boards.  In designing electronic boards operating at high frequencies PDS integrity is a big deal.  We wrote an Excel tool that encoded all of the required knowledge (for our work) and allowed the engineer to explore various PDS integrity topologies and configurations with graphs, etc.<p>A tool I really like helped with the time consuming task of creating land and schematic patterns for Altium Designer.  Rolling-up to your desk to create schematic symbols and a pcb pattern for an FPGA with 1152 pins is, well, a nightmare.  And it is worst as a design is modified during  development stages.  Our tool was able to take a process that consumed 10 to 12 hours and shrink it down to 30 to 45 minutes.<p>We created a Powerpoint presentation that made heavy use of VBA to simulate a full control panel, complete with a dot matrix LCD display.  This tool was used to both demonstrate functionality and train people on the system without much more than a laptop running powerpoint.<p>I have a lot more examples like that.  The point being that, in the right hands, these Office tools are far more useful and capable than out of the box.<p>And then there&#x27;s the financial side.  Google tools cost money.  We upgraded our Office 2003 licenses to Office 2007 and we&#x27;ve been using that version ever since.  There&#x27;s nothing in the new versions that is compelling enough to upgrade.  This means that the cost of Office becomes insignificant and non-recurring, which can be very important.<p>Note to Microsoft:  Want to get me (and others) to upgrade again?  Make Python a NATIVE alternative to VBA.",1445289587

Craigslist was the de facto method, though. Never any misrepresentation, or other real estate trickery going on. As a student of the local private art & design school, my enrollment there was as good of credit as I ever needed. Often a jobless student could walk into an apartment with the landlord and sign the paper right there, without any background checks or financial statements. I thought this was reality.<p>In NYC the fact that brokers required bank statements, tax returns, credit check, background check, pay stubs, plus all of that and more from a co-signer (if needed) was downright disrespectful and degrading. Not to mention paying a broker 2 months worth of rent meant they never tried to get you a deal. Don&#x27;t even think of using Craigslist in NYC.<p>Now I live in an apartment in Seattle. It&#x27;s on the west side of Queen Anne hill, with a view of Elliot Bay. We found it on Craigslist.

We&#x27;ve lived in it for just over 3 years now and have no desire to move.<p>If brokers are the standard way of purchasing in major cities, then that is a real shame.

Same for a number of Mendelian trait diseases.<p>This is not genetic but not &quot;necessarily hereditary&quot;, this is hereditary, but requiring a combination of inherited &quot;things&quot; to manifest. (The typical simple case of &quot;Mendelian trait diseases&quot; to which this applies are recessive traits, which require inheriting a copy of the gene from each parent to manifest.)<p>IQ, not being a binary trait, doesn&#x27;t work the same way, and probably (even to the extent it is genetic) the product of isn&#x27;t a single, simple genetic trait of any kind, but influenced by a number of different genes.

You <i>do</i> get a compiler error when you initialize by position. In my minority opinion, you can and should use that to your advantage whenever possible. Some structs are clearly &quot;configuration-like&quot;, for instance, and you don&#x27;t want an error if a new option shows up, which will probably default to whatever you had before anyhow. Some structs are clearly data structures, and you&#x27;d really like to know if your two-dimensional point suddenly grew a third parameter. Of course it&#x27;s not a bright shining line, but it&#x27;s often pretty easy to tell which you have, or which thing you want, and use the correct initialization.<p>In this case, if you used:<p><pre><code>    T{4, &quot;hello&quot;, 3.5}}\n</code></pre>\nmost future type changes to the T struct will become compiler errors. (It won&#x27;t be if the types are compatible, for instance, changing the first to a float would still result in a legal struct. If you have richer types in play that is less of an issue.)<p>golint will then complain at you, but you can pass a command-line switch to turn that off.<p>(This, amusingly, puts me in the rare position of siding against the Go community, on the side of the language designers. Bet you may not have known there is such a position to take. :) )",1445288629

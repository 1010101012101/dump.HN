Monthly subscription
Pay per view
Ads (what specific ads are you thinking, interstitial video ads between clips etc)<p>Great article about Hollywood 'Fear' :http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/17...<p>Note:In my opinion Hollywood needs a global business model, otherwise piracy will continue to be the global model, because, today piracy suppresses a need, because Hollywood studios don't have a global solution to a big problem. So... if I'm a big fan of Californication for example, and I live in Europe, usually I need to wait 3, 4,5 months maybe a year to watch the new season, so what I do? I simply download it because I don't want to wait, and I download it because I can't access this content legally at the same time that people watch it in US, so the question is Hollywood want  to keep fighting piracy (Mission impossible, like Music Industries knows), or found a solution and start monetize contents around the world, eliminating some intermediates and making more money (because most of the times internet distribution can be much more 'direct' to consumers)<p>I think that something to manage content, like a market place for content where content owners can manage many things like, territories, revenue models etc. to each content can be the key to Hollywood move fast to a sustainable global model.<p>Some examples of companies that actually do this service to several content owners, like, Showtime, Discovery, ESPN etc. and easily provide a ""global market"" check below:<p>http://www.brightcove.com/en/

But that doesn't make them interchangeable. ;-)<p>In general I find that Python is the easiest language for me to ""think in"", syntax-wise. It is almost pseudo-code in its simplicity, and I like that it has extremely powerful namespaces. It also seems to me that it's easier to write programs in Python which ignore object orientation in favor of a more functional style, than it is in Ruby. I'm slowly falling out of love with OOP, and Ruby loves its objects.<p>I also really like Python's libraries for numerical and scientific work. For whatever reason, Python took off in the scientific community, and it's got libraries like NumPy and SciPy which I haven't seen duplicated in Ruby. It's also easy to integrate with existing Fortran and C libraries... and if you've done much work with Fortran, you know that it might be blazing fast but it's not the most pleasant thing to work in. Much nicer to glue it together with Python. :-)<p>Where Ruby shines <i>for me</i> is in its libraries for server configuration and web development. I like Python's webdev libraries, but I still find it easier to work with Rails or Sinatra than with Django or Bottle. I also think that Chef is one of the best things ever for managing servers in a programmatic fashion, and for that you need Ruby.",1332553192

Don't want to go into JIT / C flamewar... but let's take a sorting example. In samples directory you can find my hand-coded assembly code (thank you Takeshi Yamamura for the help) for sorting. GB is sorted within seconds. I am sure no JIT comes even close and I tried it hard. I my self SCEA and Javaist and JIT/LLVM enthusiast. If you need my help with compiling the sample let me know I'll gladly help... I know it is not ready for the prime time, very very cryptic badly commented too... which should not be for a sample. So you are warned. But it I never ever saw in my life a single threaded sorting performance that comes even close. Let me know if I mistaken.<p>3. Why not just use process isolation.... Well this is right way to go and zerovm would be a solution looking for a problem if and only if OS process would be secure in multi-tenant sense. However, there is no such OS. The only way is to use KVM/XEN and this is just too heavy... Another issue: why I use NaCl and not native hardware support for memory protection? The answer is two fold:<p>a) I was afraid of the amount of work needed to write my own complete OS from scratch (if I use existing stuff it would have most of shortcomings I am trying to solve in the first place)<p>b) It would be useless in its initial years if not decades as there are would be not enough applications for it to justify complete hardware dedication for zerovm. I thought about writing it as lightweight real OS running under some quickly spawned KVM processes, but still was afraid I and my team just had no spare engineering capacity for that and missing knowledge also that would be fun to acquire but just could take too long and even then it would be heavily linux-specific.",1332551988

I was a willing victim of the rather unhealthy obsession with ""getting in"" that most pre-meds develop.  Medical school, at least at first, was a rude awakening.  It was not intellectually challenging (other than by virtue of the sheer volume of material), it was rote, the hours sucked, the and the culture was unpleasant.<p>It was not until a couple of years into my residency that I started to really appreciate more of the nuances, and to enjoy practicing medicine.

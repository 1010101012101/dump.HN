There&#x27;s tons of functionality which exists in many ribbon-ified programs but not actually accessible from the ribbon.<p>If you right click on the ribbon in many applications and select &#x27;customize&#x27; you&#x27;ll find all sorts of useful functionality. The customize window (at least in Excel 2010, which I happen to be looking at at the moment) has organization to help you find the stuff you can customize the ribbon with, and it even has a &#x27;commands not in the ribbon&#x27; section!<p>Maybe the ribbon contained all functionality when it was first introduced (though I doubt it very much) but that certainly hasn&#x27;t been true for years.",1436072386

From what I&#x27;ve read it seems like the lack of ubiquity forced the Plan 9 guys out of Plan 9 and back into Ubuntu or OpenBSD. From their discussions of rc, etc it seemed like the lack of users caused them to move away from it until it just completely fell apart... But I&#x27;m not sure?<p>And where is Plan 9 now? If I want to get involved should I look into 9front? Inferno? Or this guys github mirror [0] because the Plan 9 website is down?<p>I understand these are some smart guys, but the cat-v website makes a ton of divisive statements and &quot;leaves it as an exercise to the reader&quot; to figure out why they hold these views. The trolling isn&#x27;t awful, but in general, I&#x27;m having a really tough time fighting my way into the Plan 9 circle.<p>How have you dealt with this? Aside from my initial (more historical) question, any suggestions for getting started? Is it even worth getting familiar with Plan 9 or rc or acme or sam or the plethora of ported tools? Or should I just wait until Russ Cox and Rob Pike come up with a production-ready OS?<p>No disrespect meant, just have a lot of questions.<p>[0] - <a href=""https://github.com/0intro/plan9"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/0intro/plan9</a>",1436072377

The description of what&#x27;s going on with the screwdriver would be equivalent physically and much more intuitive if air pressure wasn&#x27;t mentioned at all.<p>What&#x27;s going on is the curved back pulls air around it, which deflects it downward, and that downward force on the air implies an upward force on the screwdriver. With the sharp edge back, this detaches the air flow instead, meaning there&#x27;s much less deflection, and thus less force.<p>The air-deflection model is a much better intuition pump than the air pressure model. I think the historical dominance of the air pressure model is because it&#x27;s easier to measure - just stick some air pressure gauges on surfaces, and you can calculate what that means for lift.",1436072161

If you get a creative community there are in-world building and graphics classes, games, events, exploration, and other pass-times.  One of the best communities SL I know of is Raglan Shire, tiny AV community, no sex, violence stuff or anything like that, fun and very active.  Second Life would take too much to explain, best to visit it Raglan Shire has a webpage it&#x27;s <a href=""http://www.raglanshire.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.raglanshire.com</a><p>Otherwise if you are in suburban area I bet there are a bunch of community groups, either to participate or volunteer in.  The local senior centrer is a good start, either to work there or find out about other local groups... Library too.",1436069780

It does work better for when the melody progresses into that range, true, but I think it&#x27;s a &quot;right tool for the job&quot; situation.  Often 8va&#x27;s are used for when you want to raise a single note or chord one time, and that would be much more readable than a separate staff or ledger lines.  It seems like it&#x27;s a random access vs sequential read type thing.  8va is better if you&#x27;re jumping to a far octave with no intermediate context; stacked staves would be better for when the melody incrementally takes you there.<p>I&#x27;d love to see what the equivalents of both approaches would be in this notation.",1436069731

Church, known black-market-labor places where a &quot;boss&quot; will come and pick up a select number of people for the day. And go after these places..<p>A person coming in will probably seek the assistance of close family members, or seek the assistance of a trusted figure (hence my example of Church). Maybe it would be useful to talk with the representatives of these communities and explain to them what you are trying to do. I think they&#x27;ll be pleased that someone even cares and will have a lot to say about the actual situation and you can use that to tweak it and make it fit..<p>They&#x27;re not using the internet? It might make sense that they might not be able to afford a smartphone or a computer and internet access, etc. So I think it&#x27;d be good to talk to community leaders.<p>Good luck..",1436069415

It is only my purpose here to tell you about this fact.

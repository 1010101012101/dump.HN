For instance, Amazon Prime (Student) was free for a year last year, now it's free for 6 months. From this we can guess that a year was overly generous and they didn't make enough money off of that through the increase in purchase volume.<p>Additionally, Amazon has significant deals with their shipping carrier for the mass quantity of things they ship out.  This reduces their shipping costs.<p>The other component that reduces their shipping cost is the warehouse locations. Newegg used to (still does?) aim to get their packages delivered in 2 days. Their warehouses were strategically set up for that, and even if you ordered 3 day shipping  you could get it in 2 days, it just wasn't guaranteed.  I'm sure Amazon's warehouse layout is similar where most items reasonably get to their location in 2 days via cheaper shipping, and they can just pay for the extra SLA for the packages that might not.",1320361012

If it is no-communication parallelizable, then it's very easy to do. The more communication or the more data striping you do, the more interesting it becomes.<p>In any case, tons of people would like a simple sql like language for hadoop.  There already exist some examples: pig, sawzall, etc.  Unfortunately, the inefficiencies hurt.  Say pig takes 2x as much data processing as hand coding java.  At large scale, that can eat you alive.  To get some intuition about scale, review Ron Bodkin's, former vp eng at quantcast, slides: [1], page 9 and on.  Obviously if a 2x penalty means going from 4 to 8 machines in your cluster, it's not such a big deal.  But if you buy clusters a datacenter's cage worth at a time or more, its painful.  We haven't escaped the tradeoff between programmer time and computer cost.<p>People would also love something as easy to program as R or matlab that magically scales to large data.  Nobody has written such a thing despite quite a lot of demand, which makes me think it's even harder than I thought it as, and I believe it to be a quite hard task.<p>For the tools: I'm not a qc spokesperson and none of this represents the opinion of my employer and wasn't endorsed by them.

3194036,comment,3192872,3193597,3,0,armon,,,"I'm not saying that one solution avoids the need for setting up things in a sane way. In both cases, you need to configure things properly or you can shoot yourself in the foot.<p>However, depending on the systems your company uses and your configurations, one solution might be simpler than another. Network topologies tend to be very static. You might have a public subnet, and a few private subnets.<p>Over time, you might add or remove web servers to the public subnet, or add various services to the private subnets. Especially if you are using a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), you might have many different services that need to interact with each other, but not with the public internet.<p>When you are using security groups, you need to make sure to have separate SG's for each category of machine (public, private) and then manage them at a service level, and manage the interaction between multiple SGs. For example, Web should be available on port 80 from the internet, but the DB should only be available on port XX accessible from the Web SG. But also accessible from the same port from a Service SG, etc.<p>So as you continue to iterate on your services and deploy new ones, you need to be constantly tweaking the security group configurations. With VPC, once you have a sane public/private topology you can forget about it.<p>Additionally, most SOAs try to provide some form of high availability. For us, that means cross region / cross AZ replication and availability. Doing cross AZ is fairly simple in both EC2 and VPC, but doing cross region in EC2 is a pure nightmare. You cannot apply a security policy across regions, so you have no simple way to allow your nodes to communicate.<p>Since VPC acts as a distinct private network, we can simply use site-to-site VPN configurations between our regions, and nodes can easily and freely communicate with each other. There is nothing to worry about, since the private subnets are connected over VPN, and are using hostnames that are only routable within our private network.<p>Don't get me wrong, security groups can be properly used to provide a totally secure environment where only trusted nodes are allowed to communicate. You can add monitoring and configuration testing easily as well. But once you try to scale up past a few servers, move to a SOA, and provide cross-region availability, VPC becomes the simpler alternative.",1320360468

This is one of those things that is, I think, easier to do declaratively one level up in abstraction. (You can see examples of this by looking at invocations of our Aggregate operator in the above documents.)<p>I had assumed there was no arbitrary state because of the replay semantics. Let's say bolt A sends tuples to bolt B. B has internal state. A sends tuples t1, t2, t3 and t4. A receives acknowledgements that t1, t3 and t4 were processed. So t2 needs to be replayed. But the semantics of what that means is undefined - B has internal state that already incorporates, for certain, t3 and t4, and maybe t2. (While it's unlikely, you never know where a tuple got lost.) So replaying t2 is problematic - do you just blindly replay it, and allow potentially broken semantics? The alternative is to do rollback, which is quite hairy.",1320359970

I think you have a point, I just don't think it is quite the point you are trying to make.<p>To wit, this is a lot of the reason the storied SF law firm Heller Ehrman collapsed a few years ago: a large group I believe simultaneously left the firm, and the firm had losses, and there was no capital base left to draw on to get over bad times (for the record, a lot of professional services firms like investment banks used to be organized this way, and in bad years, the partners would be responsible for recapitalizing the firm.  This is one of the reasons you so frequently saw IBs and other similar firms so anxious to sell themselves in the 90s, and it was, in fact, the primary driver behind the notoriously secretive Goldman Sachs going public: they had people rejecting partnership because losses made it unattractive, and their capital base was too unstable to compete in the global big leagues when it was just partners).<p>That said, Heller was cobbled together through a series of acquisitions, most notably for the HN audience, the famed Venture Law Group.  And it's not like this was all terrible, the firm lasted for well over 100 years.<p>Similarly, people have acquired real estate brokerage firms, where you'd think there'd be even _less_ of value to acquire, but they do it profitably.  I think Cendant  paid like $50m for Corcoran Group.

The bigger problem is people are accustomed to typical 'write down the word' CAPTCHAs and yet, they're fed up with them, so anything different would only be more annoying and hardly more secure. It's also hard to think of a challenge type that would have enough combinations for blind guessing to be ineffective and not be of the text-based type we all know.

For\nexample, after begrudgingly allowing 22 or so ""fart"" apps into the app\nstore, they said, ""ok, we gave you some fart apps, now you have enough\nfart apps, we aren't going to allow any more fart apps into the\nstore"".

Literally, we can probably get the same quality of education I teach in class for about 1 to 2 percent of the cost, Thrun told me.</i><p><i>The traditional university, in his view, serves a fortunate few, inefficiently, with a business model built on exclusivity.

But its also insanely uneconomical.</i><p><i>Thrun acknowledges that there are still serious quality-control problems to be licked. How do you keep an invisible student from cheating? How do you even know who is sitting at that remote keyboard? Will the education really be as compelling  and will it last?

I'm deciding between selling an eBook + code versus just blogging it. If such a service allowed me to sell access at $3 per chapter/turoial, I'd consider it.<p>All in all, you might take this angle and focus on a specific type of content in order to get traction.

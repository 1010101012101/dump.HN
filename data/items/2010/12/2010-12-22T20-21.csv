PHP is my tool of choice for small and compact web projects and since I try to keep them as simple as possible performance isn't that much of a concern. Anyway I did a small benchmark and was a bit surprised:<p>direct access: 0.276369s
getter access: 0.540416s
property overloading access: 0.825164s<p>Of course I can publish the benchmark source if someone is interested. It basically accesses a property 1000000 times adds the returned value to a sum (so that it's not optimized away… just in case).<p>The overhead looks ok for me. 1 out of 5 properties can be redirected via property overloading before its performance is worse than getter methods. I don't really know much about the internals of large PHP projects but I you can avoid most ""empty"" getter and setter methods and handle the view exceptions with property overloading performance seems fine for me.<p>Unexpected behavior might be a problem. However not existing properties still return NULL. The only difference is that no notice is generated… and that can be easily done with one line at the end of the __get() and __set() functions. Management of ""raw"" property overloading can be troublesome for a larger number of properties. However you can simply add some runtime reflection to call a corresponding getter function. But in that case I would start to think about the interface and if I might have done something wrong (in regards to encapsulation).<p>Having spend much time in the Ruby world I really like the kind of interfaces you can build with property overloading (like SimpleXML). For me more fluid handling like that is worth the performance cost.",1293051317

It's part of a nasty feedback cycle: the progressive centralization of the internet.  The internet is supposed to have no centre.  Centralizing it effectively mean shutting it down, and get back to something like AOL.<p>The feedback cycle itself is quite simple.  First, people start not to use the whole internet.  Like, they don't send e-mail (they ask their mail provider to do it for them), they don't host a web site, etc.  Second, ISPs start to restrict their customers: they filter the SMTP port, they offer an asymmetric bandwidth, and some don't even give you a public IP!  They get away with all those restrictions because too few people felt them in the first place.  That leads to situations that would be unfathomable otherwise, like MegaUpload replacing Peer to peer for file sharing.<p>The ultimate conclusion of this trend is a connected world divided in 2 categories: (Big) companies, which will have full internet connexions, and the regular folk, which will have nothing but the outgoing HTTP port open.  Which means that to do <i>anything</i>, a user will have to find some central hub first, and go through that. Facebook is one of those hubs. Facebook is part of this trend.<p>With a quality network, some services wouldn't have any reason to exist at all: Gmail, YouTube, Facebook, MSN, MegaUpload… Give everyone a symmetric bandwith with all ports open and a Freedom Box, and those services are all toast.  Give everyone a convenient, secured, asymmetric, pseudo internet connexion, and our <i>freedoms</i> are toast.",1293050985

Ada was going to save the world - everything in the US Government was going to move to Ada, learn it or be a dinosaur.  Ada had some very unique traits that made it very flexible.  Dealing with financial figures/budgets? overload your math operators to handle currency.  Dealing with extremely accurate numbers for missile tracking? overload your math operators to handle extremely precise numbers.<p>The problem was, after receiving this Ada training, replacing Cobol (which was the main intent), never took place.  Now, the US Government allows programming groups to choose the 'right' language for the job.  Ada is still used in some government and civillian tasks, but, it certainly didn't live up to the original hope.  I believe portions of the Boeing 777 use Ada.  It was still cheaper and easier to maintain Cobol code than to rewrite - and still is.  I know two recruiters that occasionally mention their passing need for Cobol programmers - and it's been 25 years since Ada was going to replace Cobol.<p>PHP was originally developed to get away from Perl CGI and allow pages to be easily scripted and customized.<p>Every language has a particular strength or weakness and their own following.  Not that you can't accomplish almost any task with any of them, it is selecting a language that might handle that task more efficiently.<p>Even for something like webapps, if you had 30 people in a room, I seriously doubt you would get any consensus on the best language for web scripting.  Add on top of the language choice, frameworks, and you've got another religious war.<p>I don't think I have any projects that use a single language in deployment, even discounting bash from the equation.

Peter Parkes<p>Skype downtime today<p>Skype structureEarlier today, we noticed that the number of people online on Skype was falling, which wasn’t typical or expected, so we began to investigate.<p>Skype isn’t a network like a conventional phone or IM network -- instead, it relies on millions of individual connections between computers and phones to keep things up and running. Some of these computers are what we call ‘supernodes’ -- they act a bit like phone directories for Skype. If you want to talk to someone, and your Skype app can’t find them immediately (for example, because they’re connecting from a different location or from a different device) your computer or phone will first try to find a supernode to figure out how to reach them.<p>Under normal circumstances, there are a large number of supernodes available. Unfortunately, today, many of them were taken offline by a problem affecting some versions of Skype. As Skype relies on being able to maintain contact with supernodes, it may appear offline for some of you.<p>What are we doing to help? Our engineers are creating new ‘mega-supernodes’ as fast as they can, which should gradually return things to normal. This may take a few hours, and we sincerely apologise for the disruption to your conversations. Some features, like group video calling, may take longer to return to normal.<p>Stay tuned to @skype on Twitter for the latest updates on the situation -- and many thanks for your continued patience in the meantime.<p>=====================",1293050628

When I said that a lot of the current shells can learn a thing or two from ksh, I was talking about the scripting part. And there it's mostly POSIX/Bourne with a few things from ksh and some idiosyncratic new features. The rc shell from Plan 9 was an interesting approach, too.<p>Zsh/bash/fish don't try to innovate in that area. The readline library (which is the basis for most of the interactive history features) is quite nice, but I'd much rather save me some repetition than make sure that the repetitive commands can be entered fast enough.<p>I guess it all comes down to how repetitive your shell usage is. If you're very exploratory, i.e. use different paths, systems and command line options all the time, completion helps, just like it helps you navigate a huge mess of a class inheritance tree. If you find yourself able to factor out common tasks, scripting is a bit more helpful. And most of the time, I fall into the second camp, which is why I've never found fish all that attractive.

None of those got saved. When I clicked on Cast/Change Predictions again, they were all reset.<p>""Contest"" doesn't sound like the right word. Think of something more relevant to cricket.<p>On your ""Start a Contest"" page, why don't you add Flags of countries which one can drag and drop to make a match. Over time, you could add a list of upcoming international, national and domestic league matches.<p>Have a look at <a href=""http://smarkets.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smarkets.com</a> and see what they are doing right. Use the site to see how it works. I used it during the football world cup and it was effortless. I had never used a betting site before.<p>This is a huge market, so you've done well to start.

Maybe even ""Eclipse will do that for me"". Needless to say that encapsulation isn't understood then, too. But encapsulation is bigger topic of it's own and would have been to much for that post.<p>While talking about that with other people I got the impression that just explaining the way it was meant to be does not work well.

3554172,comment,3553806,3554074,16,0,jakevoytko,,,"It's pretty hard.<p>This assumes the existing radio links can handle the extra bandwidth. I don't see a WiFi card, so they may use radios with low-baud serial connections. Maybe the radios are good enough that doubling the radio communications is fine. Now, all the new hardware means extra draw (and potentially extra batteries) on each quadrotor. They might fly with this extra weight, but it won't be nearly as long.<p>Also, indoor flying means no GPS. In this case, using accelerometers means <i>something</i> is dead-reckoning the position of each quadrotor. There's no more space/power for processing juice, so the external system must do this. Now the external system must take this localized data from each quadrotor and place it in some global coordinate system (how does it do that?). It will use dead-reckoning to determine the position of each quadrotor. This means the system is accumulating errors over time, for each quadrotor. At least sailors could eventually correct their position with stars - there is no real global correction with these sensors. They could hypothetically do radio range estimation on the radio signals of the quadrotors, but who knows what kind of accuracy they will get.<p>Now I remember why I left robotics :-)",1328453921

I once worked with 5 other C++ developers all sitting at a couple fold out tables in a one room office to work on a software that was used in a highly competitive niche market and this was by far the most productive I ever was.  Like the OP, we could instantly talk to one another about a problem or to ask why certain blocks of code were a certain way.  We wrote software used to track bets (off shore gambling).  Our software sold for around $100K and at the time (about '93-'95) our only competitor was a large corporation that appeared to struggle to keep up with us.  We were so innovative and fast to deliver.  Those days long behind me, I often wish to find that same cohesiveness in my work-life again.",1328453842

Simply it is cheapest kind of office space, without walls you may use big space (lets say 25 m x 40 m, so 1000 m^2 with windows on both longer walls) and place desks everywhere. With walls you will be able to use not more than 800 m^2, and probably even less because walls block light and this part in the middle of office with walls will be dark and you cannot set desks there.
Also air condition is cheaper.<p>Personally I loved solution used in Motorola, so cubicles with thick walls (about 10-15 cm of sponge or similar stuff) which has about 160-180 cm of height. Even people talking in normal way in corridor didn't interrupted you.",1328453026

But that's because the environment is so complicated: there are several layers of servers, mail is stored on NFS so there are weird locking issues, LDAP is used for user accounts, etc.  There are some very bad failure semantics and if we're not careful, we start bouncing mail.<p>My small setups use exactly the same software (Debian, postfix, dovecot, spamassassin) but the environments are much simpler: one server, no NFS, no LDAP.  I use a VPS so I don't have to worry about hardware.  Backups are an off-site rsync in cron.  Failures rarely happen but when they do the semantics are much nicer: temporary failures so the mail is resent later.  My VPS host failed for the first time in 5 years recently, so I couldn't get mail for a few hours, but I didn't <i>lose</i> any mail and didn't have to spend any time on recovery.<p>I also run other stuff on my VPS, so the monthly cost and recurring maintenance overhead (security updates/backups) is amortized.

I think it depends whether the not drinking till some ages is self-imposed, or externaly imposed, and how much external that prohibition is.<p>For example I weren't drinking till 18, because I was very religious in primary/secondary school, and priests encouraged promising to yourselves to never drink till 18. Most people didn't care, I did (religion is nice mind-hack, btw, it's a shame it stops working when you don't believe it anymore).<p>So I had to learn to party without alcohol, and I did. Some people were unfriendly because of that, but I figured they were obviously dumb, if me not drinking spoils their fun, so I won't care about them.<p>Then I got 18, go to university, and drink alcohol like everybody, but never feel the need to drink too much. As for now I'm 28, and I've never had hangover, or lost memory. And I was partying hard at university.<p>In my country you can buy alcohol from 18, but enforcement is not very strict, so kids start drinking in primary school, because it's cool, because you're gambling system. Of course most people grow up eventually. Binge drinking is a part of culture (well, wdka is Polish/Russian invention :) ), but young people prefer beer, and you have to really want to got drunk, when drinking beer, to got drunk.<p>I think it more depends on the attitude and example of parents (mine had drink on occasions, but I've never seen my parents drunk. They also never made the alcohol sound like it's some great forbidden fruit they had to protect me from).",1328452859

If you elect to give away your content for free, that's your choice.  Others have already proven that giving away DRM-free content can lead to making a tidy profit.  See the humble-bundles and Louis CK's recent experiment as demonstrations.  Look at Bandcamp.com, and the countless artists selling DRM free content.  I've spent more money there the past year then anything the labels have produced.<p>2. Less likely to be cracked?  That's wishful thinking at best.  It's already been shown countless times that smaller companies content will be cracked just as readily as larger companies.  It's not as if they are using some other form of DRM.<p>3. Which bugs afflict you in the video playing department?  I've found that playing videos without Flash is fairly simple.  Granted, you need to provide 2 videos, but you'll what you need.  Are you referring to lack of DRM support in these browsers? In fact, I'm not really sure what you are referring to here.<p>4. That's not true.  Rather, content that includes extras like DRM will provide an inferior user experience.  I'm sorry, but even Valve, who I love, doesn't have as great an experience as I can get if they'd remove the DRM.  And it's because of the DRM they use.  If you attach DRM to your content, you are degrading the UX.  There is no argument against that.  It's simply the way it is.  Even if you simply put your content in a membership area, I have to log in rather than simply see that content.  If I have to install some 3rd party software to read that content, it's a degraded experience.  I'm sorry, but it's the content providers that choose to degrade the experience.  At least man up and take ownership.<p>Finally, you claim people like me need a far stronger argument.  I guess that's fair.  We could all use stronger arguments.  But at the same time, the arguments for DRM aren't strong either.  The only argument in favor of DRM that I can get behind is: ""It's my content, I can do what I want with it.""  Yes, you can, and I support that.  Beyond that, not much more can be said.",1328450707

It is everything or nothing. Trying to keep a balance between the two extremes takes so much effort, leaves a lot of room for failure and requires to adapt patterns. The black-and-white approach is simple and effective. It does not require you to think a lot and there is not much room for error.<p>Thinking clearly about what amount of alcohol is appropriate for you while you are actively incapacitating yourself is just very hard for some people. While I appreciate relativity and nuances it's just not worth it in this case.",1328450497

That doesn't mean it will fail in that time frame.  It means if you have a large population of that configuration, that is the rate you would be dealing with for drive replacement planning.<p>The MTBF and MTTF calculations apply to populations of drives (e.g. a given model) not to a given drive.  The values provide no predictability for the failure of any specific drive.  Using the values for that purpose is a common misapplication.  A drive with a MTTF of 1,000,000 power-on hours can fail in 15 minutes or never during its useful life.<p>As a result, a three drive array will have a higher probability of failure over a given interval, but the MTTF/MTBF of the drives is essentially unchanged.<p>Think of it this way... The probability of winning the lottery is one in 20,000,000.  The probability that someone (anyone) will win the lottery in a given week may be one out of ten - 10%.  In other words, some person wins the lottery, on average, one time in ten weeks.  That doesn't mean that your probability of winning the lottery is 10%.  It also doesn't mean that the average probability of winning the lottery is 10%.  It also doesn't change the probability of winning the lottery; it's still one in 20,000,000, even if three people win in a 10 week interval.",1282239566

1617960,comment,1617572,1617572,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"The utility of location based services has a strong network effect. For finding friends, they need to be on the service. For coupons & deals, business development is far easier with a larger audience.<p>Interestingly, one way to be ubiquitous is to open up the service as a platform. That means that it makes sense for Facebook to let Foursquare & Gowalla use the platform. Those using Foursquare and feeding into Facebook make Facebook more useful.<p>It also matters whether location is a way to drive engagement for Facebook, or if they expect deals to be a major revenue driver. I highly doubt even a large effort on local deals and coupons would earn significant revenue for Facebook relative to their astoundingly successful ad system. They aren’t mutually exclusive of course, in that they can have hooks for their ads to leverage places. Ignore for a moment that mobile ads are universally horrible and Facebook doesn’t have any (yet).<p>This makes me think Foursquare can still grow by being the best place to find deals.

I watched as people stood up left and right, saying ""I'll take over hpricot,"" ""I'll work on Shoes,"" ""I've got Camping,"" and I thought, man, this would be a great time to step up and really give back. My only real open source contributions were my own projects, that nobody really uses. I could never seem to find anything useful to contribute elsewhere.<p>My favorite project of _why's was Hackety Hack. I _was_ that kid who learned to program with GW-BASIC when I was seven, and the world is totally different now. So I checked out who had stood up to work on Hackety... and nobody did.<p>As the day progressed, I expected someone to. It was _why's masterpiece, after all. Lots of the other libraries he wrote are part of Hackety. I didn't want the responsibility of taking charge of such a well-known project, since I'm just a nobody. I figured that someone better than me would step up, and then I could just help them.<p>But nobody did.<p>Finally, after lots of thinking about it, I gave a small little ""I will."" Bam. I'm in charge. Sweet! ...<p>Oh God, this is scary! This is a huge responsibility. What if I do poorly? Everybody on the internet will see. Can I really do this? I haven't even been coding in Ruby all that long!<p>Then, to complicate things, I had some personal stuff come up, and I couldn't really find the time in my schedule to actually write some code. There were also upstream issues; Hackety needed Shoes 3, which was in development still, and really unstable and an absolute motherfucker to compile. So I got frustrated when I even did try to work on it.<p>By Christmas last year, I had made some small modifications, and released it as 0.9, hoping to get some people interested to give me some support. But that didn't really happen. So, I trucked along, doing little bits here and there.<p>Finally, I had a serious breakthrough with my Shoes development. I got it to work with Snow Leopard. That's a whole other story. But the momentum and high off of doing that got me to put a bunch more work into Hackety, and I made some decent progress. Also, around this time, I got an email from Fela, who wanted to work on Ruby Summer of Code. And he wanted to do it with Hackety. Between he, myself, the Shoes team, and some of my friends, we've made really great strides with the project over the summer, and I couldn't be happier. 1.0-final should be out within a month, once we polish up some more things, and sort out a few issues. I still occasionally grapple with ""not being _why"", if that makes any sense.

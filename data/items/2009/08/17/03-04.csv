Then this can spark interest in the ""buyers"" who may find the right experience/knowledge they were looking for.<p>If you get the right distribution, I believe it can overcome the challenge you speak of.

There are really not any good reasons for believing most of what you said there, but people seem to think that no arguments for these positions are necessary: it's enough to state them forcefully and claim that anyone who disagrees is an idiot.<p>>It's a basic fact that science is the study of reality by any effective means;<p>I guess you could define science that way (although it hardly seems like a ""basic fact""), but I'm not sure that it would do anything useful in this context. The whole question at issue is what constitutes an ""effective"" means of studying various topics of interest. For example, what are the effective means of studying moral facts? You seem to think that they are limited to brain science, but why do you think this?<p>Incidentally, your proposed definition of science is clearly at odds with most standard conceptions. For example, it might (hypothetically) turn out that pure intuition is the most effective way of studying reality -- we might turn out to have incredibly good intuitions about how the world works. According to your definition, pure untested intuition would then be ""scientific"". As it happens of course, intuition isn't very effective. The point is that all kinds of crazy methods might turn out to be effective, but we wouldn't therefore want to call them scientific. The methods used in science have to be in some sense rational as well as merely effective, although no-one has ever quite pinned down the precise nature of this additional constraint.<p>>We've prodded the brain enough to be reasonably sure your psychology (purpose, meaning, morals, values etc) is in physical atoms & not in a soul.<p>Maybe you should refer to some specific results in psychology, neuroscience or phsyics that back this statement up. For example, an explanation of how facts about purpose and morality could reduce to facts about the primitives of physics. There are a few explanations on the market, but you might at least be specific about which one you are buying into. Here's an exercise. Explain how the moral fact in (1) reduces to physical facts:<p>(1) It is wrong to kill someone for no reason.",1250478765

So how can you use the process itself to get people to sort themselves somewhat?<p>Hypothesis: you come up with a bunch of startup ideas in big spaces where no easy solutions exist, but many many startups have gone and failed.  These apps go in the ""paint-by-numbers"" pile and get less scrutiny, because you figure two things:<p>1. For someone who doesn't have an idea or a problem to solve, they'll look at YC and see this list of pre-existing problems that need solutions.  They could learn a domain or a space really well and organically come up with their own idea, or they could use one of these.  We assume that people in that situation who pick the easier path will probably come up with solutions that suck, but that's ok, because it keeps fewer apps from the ""artisan"" pile, which get much heavier attention.<p>2. If someone does submit an app to the ""paint-by-numbers"" pile that is truly novel or brilliant, it'll probably leap off the page, so all is not lost.<p>I guess my overall hypothesis is that people who <i>need</i> to pick an idea off a list like this and/or don't know enough about a space to come up with their own idea are probably unlikely to succeed.  This just gives them an opportunity to declare so more readily :)<p>I'm sure that YC isn't doing this, but would it be useful?",1250478630

It seems to dilute the quality of the comments for two reasons - first, they themselves aren't that insightful. But more scary is that like five other people typically jump in and reply with more internetisms afterwards. The comments here have historically been the best I've seen, but seem to be slipping just a touch lately.<p>I don't know how that would be tackled exactly. I suppose just introducing new people politely to the culture here, and for current members to refrain from upvoting comments that are ok but have the pseudo-clever semi-snarky internet vibe to them.",1250478587

So, my question to you is how do you explain qualia?<p>Qualia is a term describing the actual _feeling_ of something as consciously perceived. Wikipedia explains it better: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia</a><p>The problem is this: Consider perceiving the color red. An outside observer can explain this as photons hitting my eye and me reacting. The only problem is, I can actually see the color. How can a series of chemical reactions cause me to feel?<p>The irony of this is, of course, that pzombies (philosophical zombies: beings that don't feel anything but act exactly as though they do) would come to the same conclusion.<p>Since it is impossible for anyone other than myself to verify that I exist as anything more than a series of chemical reactions (ie. I actually feel),  it is a difficult problem to work with.<p>I, for my part, was led to the conclusion that the scientific-materialist perspective was wrong, or at least grossly incomplete. It seems logical as science is essentially the art of useful fiction: we make up the simplest story that predicts the right answers and use it until it breaks (and sometimes beyond that and just avoid the points we know it breaks at).<p>I'm very interested in hearing others' views.",1250478027

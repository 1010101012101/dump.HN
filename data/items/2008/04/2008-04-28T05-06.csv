175391,comment,175319,175319,0,0,samratjp,,,"The thing is that technology is only a means, so ask a real question such as:<p>What ""can"" you design under $1 that solves a major problem in the world?<p>Example answer: packets of salt and sugar is all it takes to prevent/solve dehydration in many sub-saharan countries. Can it save the world? Yes. Is it executable? Yes. Is the UI simple? Yes, ziplock sugar packets. Marketing costs? evangelize.<p>Point is that the technical skills can be evaluated to a great accuracy more or less, it is the real-time thinking skill that matters; i.e. it is extremely ok to ask a question that demands considerable attention and problem-solving. An ideal interviewee knows that a good answer is not a matter of complete polarization, but careful articulation.",1209362326

Whatever it is that you are trying to do using core JS, jQuery should be able to handle it. jQuery is fast, and makes your code really short. I suggest you go straight to jQuery and save time.

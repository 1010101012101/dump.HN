I think I did some exams 5 times before I passed (this might be easier in Dutch universities than in the US system). I put off my Master&#x27;s thesis for a few years while I worked a full-time job, then switched subjects and managed to complete it anyway (9 years after I started). That first job was with a startup I co-founded, where my opportunities for growth sort of fizzled out after five years. After six, I quit, posted my resume online in a few places and got a nice new job through a recruiting agency. Started in the new job as a C++ engineer and was promoted to a management role in 6 months... Lots of challenges!",1448290743

10614882,comment,10610690,10614545,0,0,trgn,,,"The point is that building more roads doesn&#x27;t reduce congestion. This is because the number of car trips increases as well. As the supply of roads grow, the demand for car trips goes up as well, to the benefit of no one.<p>It is definitely an editorial decision of Citylab to evangelize this finding. But in this case, not in a mendacious way, more in an exasperating i told you once i told you a million times kind of way.<p>That NJs economy stalled due to not having enough roads is a conjecture.<p>You don&#x27;t need physical room for economic growth (well, I&#x27;d say in the US you don&#x27;t). The US is incredibly wasteful, to the point of it being obscene, with its physical space. The upside is dubious. But the negative results of car slavery are clear: it excludes children and seniors of being independently mobile, it creates a terribly unattractive environment, high speed roads - aka car sewers - are a killer on property values since nobody wants to live next to on, driving claims more than 30000 lives per year in this country alone.<p>Cars have benefits though!!! I have three, should that factoid help convince you. But they work best in a handful of use cases: longer trips, hauling stuff, recreational driving in the country, ... Basically, what the commercials show you.

But if we build parks, this mostly just lowers the density of park-goers in the short term.  In the long term, people move to live near the parks and use the parks more, so that the density of park-goers rises again, and we loose most of the benefit!&quot;<p>There&#x27;s lots of constructive arguments to be had about the relative benefits of investment in roads vs. rail vs. whatever, and tons of good criticism to level against subsidies and un-taxed externalities (for all those options).

I kept freelancing in my spare time and helped my brother build a successful e-commerce company over the past 11 years.<p>In 2012 I left full time employment and continued freelancing to two regular clients.<p>In 2013 I built an MVP to be notified of changes on a web page, and while at an E-commerce trade show, I asked the CEO of a company exhibiting the question about how they get client e-commerce products into their system without any technical integration.<p>This resulting in me creating a second MVP to scrape e-commerce data for retailers wanting to sell on marketplaces.  The CEO spent the following 6 months convincing me to be their CTO, which I&#x27;ve been doing for the past 2.5 years now.<p>So yeah, my future changed very drastically based on me deciding to wait a few more minutes to see if the CEO was free to have a chat.

On my daily route to work I see the effect that adding just a few more cars to a road does.  Adding 5% more cars doesn&#x27;t increase congestion by 5% it actually brings traffic to a standstill where it was moving at an effective pace before.<p>Adding extra capacity can even make the problem worse because of what happens when increased capacity meets lower capacity.  Human driver are terrible at going from two lanes down to two.  You could say that this is bad design but in cities especially there are constraints that you can&#x27;t really design around very easily without destroying massive parts of the city.  This was done in the past to allow highways to penetrate right into cities but those highways just slowed to a crawl.<p>As for cost effectiveness bike lanes are a lot cheaper than extra road lanes and very much cheaper than elevated highways.  Bus rapid transit is also extremely cheap.  That&#x27;s before you start looking at other cost benefits such as increased health for more exercise and less pollution.",1448290497

Most of them are nearly useless, often intentionally so by design. It&#x27;s natural for people to demand something useful, and light rail is nearly universally more useful than busing (including BRT) in any given market.<p>> It isn&#x27;t flexible and its cost per mile is staggering let alone the cost of maintenance.<p>Those are <i>benefits</i> of light rail, not drawbacks. The higher costs and inflexibility of light rail represents an authentic long-term commitment to good useful transit in that area.<p>To replicate that value with a Bus system requires you to build grade separated, dedicated right of way. Which is where 90% of Light Rail&#x27;s cost comes from. So if your going to spend that money, you might as well put in real Light Rail and get all of the benefit.",1448290213

That&#x27;s not some incidental thing to gloss over, but a clear case of crippling binary intervention.<p>There were plenty of land grant programs at the time, such as the Homestead Act. The state, through common law, retained eminent domain and condemnation of private land for nominally &quot;public&quot; purposes. There were several immigration restriction acts passed that served as a free trade barrier.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that the railroads which characterized the Gilded Age were kickstarted by government initiative in the form of the Pacific Railroad Acts, which ensured land and bond grants.<p>There were at least a dozen tariff acts passed by the time the Gilded Age was emerging, and indeed U.S. trade policy was quite protectionist back then. The U.S. have also been involved in plentiful military interventions, some overseas, others covered by the Monroe Doctrine, since the earliest days for economic and hegemonic reasons.<p>The federal government was weaker, but not as much as often presented. They tried wholesale embargoes as early as 1807, enacted tariffs, controlled trade (Commerce Clause and other justifications), intervened militarily frequently, and remember that the Constitution in general greatly expanded federal power relative to the prior Articles of Confederation.<p>As such, I&#x27;d think it disingenuous to qualify the Gilded Age as &quot;libertarian&quot;. There wasn&#x27;t really so much as a <i>system</i> back then, it was a country in an identity crisis trying to see what worked, and often coming to protectionist conclusions that would foreshadow what was to come (ironically, tariffs are much less of a problem in the present than back then).

I know now that getting a grip on how long R&D takes really requires one to experience it first hand. I do know one thing, I was dead wrong about our original shipping dates, and I posted those estimated dates without having the skillset to really estimate them. I’m also glad we didn’t stick to our estimated shipping dates. When you’re wrong about something its disastrous to not admit it and just stick with the original plan. If we had shipped what we had at the original shipping dates we would have disappointed everyone. The printer didn’t work that well and wasn&#x27;t designed to be produced in high volume.

The brain has to filter out whether the first variable holds a reference or is a hash variable, then has two different dereference syntaxes to choose from (ok JavaScript has two variants, too), then later &#x27;->&#x27; are optional. You get used to it, but it still draws some attention away from the more interesting parts of a program.<p>In a way my project improves a bit over this, since you&#x27;re often not using Perl base data structures directly anymore; OTOH of course that means writing out a function or method call, and while this is more universal (which I like) it also uses more space to type. Also, sigils are getting more pointless when using libraries (I usually don&#x27;t use % and @ anymore, always references, the good part of which is that this is giving a bit more consistency).",1448289588

Did well in high school, didn&#x27;t do to well in my school&#x27;s comp sci program (only minored).<p>At work, adopted a policy to always try to own more things and make things easier for others (particularly those above me) without becoming a silo for information. Write everything down, make it accessible, and give people status updates (which include any accomplishments) before they ever need to ask for them. Then, just get to work, and own things as much as possible. Because of this, I was able to show ownership above my given position for every single job, which really helped when the next opportunity came along. Additionally, always be learning / focused on continuous improvement. If you can constantly be thinking about ways to chart a path forward and suggesting those things when they make sense, you work to make everyone&#x27;s life easier.<p>You also have to know your market and not be afraid to leave whenever the writing is on the wall or when you feel your ownership is limited. Leaving for those reasons rarely leads to hard feelings; if you leave because you want better ownership in helping your company but aren&#x27;t granted it, and have a track record of success, usually people don&#x27;t want to see you go and you&#x27;ll leave on good terms.<p>With this outlook, I went from a college grad in 2009 making 45k/year, and 6 years later I&#x27;m about to lead a team at 185k/year with a 40 hour work week (and paid overtime, somehow).

Now I&#x27;m going to explain how close all of this came to not happening...<p>I grew-up in the rural deep South. My parents were extremely well educated and well traveled, but they had careers that didn&#x27;t make any money. So I basically put myself through school. I got some scholarships and I taught part-time, but I had to take-out a lot of loans in the end. By the time I returned to the US, I had over $100K in debt from students loans and credit cards.<p>I didn&#x27;t manage to get a job when I first got back to the States. I moved to NYC anyway and couch-surfed with every friend I could think of. (I ran-out of people I know, so I ended-up in a hostel for a few weeks.) I&#x27;m a fencer, so I refereed college fencing tournaments for enough money to eat.<p>It took five months to get my first quant job. The job I have now is the fourth such role because the first three trading desks I worked for all ran into the ground one way or another.<p>Along the way I had a big healthcare issue that resulted in surgery. That took years to prepare for and to heal from.<p>And since you ask about failing a class, I never made below a B- in a course, but I did fail my thesis defense the first time around. I had to resubmit my dissertation with a ton of changes to pass. (By the way, I got rejected from every grad school I applied to except for Oxford.)<p>So when you think that your current path is difficult, just know that I have survived two recessions (dot-com and financial crisis) and been turned-down from most jobs I&#x27;ve applied to.<p>I have three pieces of advice for you. Firstly, always be frugal. Despite my heavy debt when I returned to the US, I actually have flawless credit since I&#x27;ve never paid a bill late. That kind of history comes in handy a lot.<p>Secondly, always keep learning. Especially in my field, I have to keep-up constantly, which means following Hacker News, reading ACM/IEEE, taking MOOCs, etc.<p>And third, make friends. Help-out other people as often as you can.

If you just want to see quickly if CF fits your needs, the place to go is Lattice[1], explicitly designed to be installable on a laptop.<p>The issue is not whether or not CF can meet my needs, but that it is crazily complex. That it is complex enough that there&#x27;s a need for a separat setup &quot;explicily designed to be installable on a laptop&quot; is to me an admission that CF is flawed from the outset. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s&#x27; installable on a laptop, incidentally, I do all my development and testing and experimentations on setups that matches (in architecture anyway) the environments I&#x27;ll deploy to.

It&#x27;s not remotely cost effective for the types of things I do. E.g. for one client I currently part-time manage a private cloud environment with abou 150 containers. Firstly, none of Pivotals options offer enough CPU or memory for us to be able to run it on 150 of the 2GB container options (it&#x27;d be more like 500+ at that size), but even if 150 was enough, the estimated cost for that would be substantially more than what it costs to lease racks + power + bandwidth + leasing costs on all the hardware + charging the cost of hardware upgrades/maintainenance and the cost of server admin. With more realistic container counts, it&#x27;d bankrupt the company in question.<p>> and deploy it to you own OpenStack or vSphere environment. Or on AWS. Or on Azure. Or some mixture of the above.<p>The complexity and/or cost of these options makes CF massive unattractive for me. I&#x27;m just in the process of cutting a clients hosting costs by about 80% by ditching AWS for a setup on managed servers, for example, and the <i>full</i> deployment of all the infrastructure we need is substantially simpler than just deploying a &quot;bare&quot; OpenStack deployment, and certainly nothing like putting CF on top.

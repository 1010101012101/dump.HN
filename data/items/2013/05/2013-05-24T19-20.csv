5764898,comment,5761297,5763950,1,0,jkn,,,"Well I was actually thinking about mutations :)<p>Let's consider a simplified model, where there are only two different bases (A and G instead of A, T, G, C) and assume that the probabilities of mutations A->G and G->A are the same. Let's consider a single base mutation[1]. No matter what the mutation probability is, and no matter what the initial distribution is, I expect that the population will converge to about 50% A and 50% G. I guess you would agree.<p>Now if we make this very wrong model a bit less wrong by including the four base types A, T, G, C, we can expect that each allele will be found in about 25% of the population. And that is for single base mutations only. A mutation that depends on the precise value of 5 different bases would be displayed by a much smaller share of the population (1/4^5 = 0.1% I guess).<p>Of course people don't get born with fully random genomes like that, the vast majority of these mutations would not yield a living embryo. But still, the intuition we can get from this is that without evolutionary pressure, a particular mutation will eventually be found in a fraction of the population that is inversely proportional to the complexity of the mutation (in most cases that would be far from the 50% of my initial intuition).<p>No idea how close these layman's speculations are from the reality...<p>[1] Such as the gene that determines the type of ear wax: <a href=""http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/mythearwax.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/mythearwax.html</a>",1369425389

5764860,comment,5764414,5764414,4,0,examancer,,,"""How will java's recent security vulnerabilities affect its popularity?""<p>This is the one question the infographic takes the time to ask. It's a poor question, but one many people seem to ask after the recent java plugin vulnerabilities.<p>Java hasn't been popular for in-browser development for many years now, and even at its height it was never <i>that</i> popular. These security vulnerabilities only affect Java use cases where untrusted java code is expected to be restricted to limited system access. This is not the environment mainstream java software will ever run in, so the mainstream use cases for java are entirely unaffected by these security issues.<p>The majority of Java software falls into two classes: desktop/native software and enterprise/server software.<p>Desktop/native software, like Minecraft or Android apps is either intended to have full system access (Minecraft) or is already restricted to making system calls through a rigid API that requires user permission to have access to (Android apps). In addition, Android uses its own Dalvik VM, so issues with Oracle's JVM are immaterial. Security of browser applets is a non-factor in both cases (android phones can't even run them).<p>Enterprise/server software are Java web applications, Java services, and other enterprise/web/server architecture pieces. These don't run on end user machines and are trusted applications, so JVM sandboxing is not really a concern.<p>There is absolutely nothing insecure about Java as a language. Occassionaly, there are issues with certain implementations of Java. These latest security flaws were in an implementation of Java that very few people use. Yes, everyone should remove Java from their browser, but if they were even using Java it almost certainly wasn't in the browser to begin with. The plugin has stuck around far long than it was useful, so good riddance.<p>Removing Java from a system altogether, as I have seen many people recommend, is in general too far and may break desktop apps users depend on that are not a security threat.<p>Sorry for the rant... I'm actually an ex-Java developer who has fallen for Ruby. There are plenty of legit problems with Java, but security generally isn't one of them.",1369424760

I've tried G+, and for a brief period a few of my friends tried it as well, but we switched back when it failed to reach critical mass. That's all Facebook has going for it, really, is the people using it; I'm sure most of us would switch to a better network if given the chance, but we won't do it unless a significant majority of our friends come along with us.<p>I don't like Facebook's approach to privacy, I absolutely hate how many permissions the Facebook app requires on my Android phone, but if I cut myself off of Facebook I'm losing out on a huge, huge percentage of social interaction with people who I know but am not particularly close to (which for most people is at least 80% of their friends list). Plus all the history I've amassed on Facebook since grade 7.<p>For better or worse, teens are stuck on Facebook for the time being, and unlike the move from MySpace, I don't see switching off of it happening any time soon. Sure, there's Twitter, Instagram, etc. which are also heavily used by my age group, but only as secondary networks - Facebook remains the definition of online social interaction.<p>EDIT: A few more thoughts:<p>An important part of it mentioned elsewhere in the thread is the fact that Facebook basically acts as a glorified address book/communications hub - if I want Chris to come to my party or add him to a group conversation about something or share a picture with him, all I need is his name.

Think about the logistics and the invasion of privacy!). Even in those cases, the government shouldn't have the power to sterilize the subject.<p>You can run educational campaigns. Teach people this stuff with sex-education or have married couples take a course(you will still miss out on a lot of people).<p>Eugenics takes away a basic right of a life form.<p>Update:<p>I understand that you may be speaking about people who have been diagnosed as having a certain genetic condition. If a disease has the capacity to cause public harm, there are exceptions made to the professional secrecy that a doctor is supposed to maintain. This involves informing relatives/a potential spouse about a condition that the patient may transmit. In cases of infectious diseases, quarantine and isolation procedures are well established. But most are for infectious conditions which can harm the public. So if the off-springs of individuals with bad genes can infect large number of people with some contagious condition, isolation protocols may apply. But that is still hypothetical.<p>If we dream up an horrendously bad genetic condition which can disrupt the human race, someone is going to come with horrendous regulations to prevent that. But the truth is most people suffering from ""bad"" gene induced conditions do not lead a normal life(do not have kids).  If the sufferer of a genetic condition can easily have kids, then that condition may not be that ""bad"". Carriers of such genes could do with some pre conceptional counseling.",1369424315

      content of all these syntactic alternatives was the same, so that
      the one causing least difficulty for existing systems should be
      chosen.  Hence it was decided to add all new information on the
      right of the @ sign, leaving the ""user"" field to the left
      completely to each system to determine (in particular to avoid the
      problem that some systems already use dot (.) internally as part
      of user names).

   The conclusion in this area was that the current ""user@host"" mailbox
   identifier should be extended to ""user@host.domain"" where ""domain""
   could be a hierarchy of domains.
      
      In particular, the ""host"" field would become a ""location"" field
      and the structure would read (left to right) from the most
      specific to the most general.
</code></pre>
It was chosen apparently because RFC 805 was standardizing to ""mailbox@computer"", and since 'mailbox' is more specific than 'computer' it became more and more specialized going left.<p>As for why 'mailbox' comes first, it's presumably because that's someone's username. The very first thing you want to see is, ""I'm sending this to drostie,"" and only afterwards do you need to know where that server is located.",1369424264

No other provider can be injected for the very good reason that .config cannot inject transitive dependencies.  Because constants cannot have any dependencies (unlike services and factories) and do not change (unlike values) they are safe to inject during the config phase.  FYI, the .run function is invoked (and its dependencies injected of course) after all modules have finished loading and all config functions have been run.  If your provider needs another provider as part of its init then you can set that up in the .run function.<p>Remember that DI in angular is not magic.

Perhaps this memory model is necessary for small pieces of high-performance code, but I wouldn't want us to keep using it as the primary memory model for new applications, especially when at least some of the current JS engines have advanced copying/compacting garbage collectors.<p>I would love to have a memory-safe language that compiles to efficient JavaScript with no intractable semantic or runtime mismatches between the JS and the source language or its libraries (e.g. no preemptive threads with shared memory) and takes full advantage of the JS engine's garbage collection, but can also be compiled ahead-of-time to fairly efficient native code for environments where JIT compilation isn't an option (e.g. iOS apps). I suspect that a language like this would need static typing. To gain traction, such a language would need to stick to fairly mainstream concepts (e.g. not purely functional).

My passion for startups started about a year ago when I discovered Hacker News. Every time I read about startups and people building things to show on HN, it gives me courage to continue with my dream of diving into the world of startups one day, ideally once I graduate. Ive been working diligently on a couple of side projects during my free time for a while now, which helps me keep engaged in web development. This summer Im interning in Seattle, WA as a software developer, and Ill finally have enough money saved up to visit San Francisco for the first time.<p>I was hoping to gain some insight from the startup community in San Francisco as to what the best time this summer might be to visit The City. I have until August 2 before my internship comes to an end, so any weekend from now until August will work! I am looking to probably arrive on a Thursday night and return to Seattle the following Sunday. This will give me a chance to use all day Friday to pay a visit to any startups that would be open to the idea of me visiting their office space that day! I am also looking for a place to stay, so if you have any recommendation as to where the best places to stay are, I would greatly appreciate any suggestions you may have!<p>If you work at a startup in SF, or know of someone who works at a startup, who would be open to the idea of me visiting your office space, send me an e-mail at jlteran@cs.arizona.edu or comment on here!<p>Cheers!",1369422166

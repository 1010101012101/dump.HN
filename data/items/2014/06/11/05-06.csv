I was recently doing some benchmarks on an AWS I2 instance type, and while doing research, I came upon AWS&#x27;s &quot;Optimizing Disk Performance&quot; [1] page, where they suggest you pre-warm the disks (note: I2 is the only instance type that is exempt).<p><i>Because of the way that Amazon EC2 virtualizes disks, the first write to any location on a standard instance store volume performs more slowly than subsequent writes. For most applications, amortizing this cost over the lifetime of the instance is acceptable. However, if you require high disk performance, we recommend that you pre-warm your drives by writing once to every drive location before production use.</i><p>Do you write to the disks before your benchmarks?

As soon as you create hard links to a file, the file is moved into a invisible folder named &quot;Private Data&quot; and becomes a &quot;node file&quot;. The original file is replaced by a stub containing the CNID (special type, special content). That&#x27;s not as efficient as having iNodes and hard links from day 1. If you mount such a volume on Mac OS Classic, the &quot;Private Data&quot; folder is totally accessible and modifiable by the user, and of course hard links do not work.<p>Hot file clustering and journaling are implemented in similar ways to hard links (invisible folders).<p>The opposite example are extended attributes (xattr) which were added in 10.4. A special filesystem structure named the &quot;Attributes File&quot; was reserved in HFS+ from day 1 but never used. De-defragmentation does not rely on any changes to the volume, it&#x27;s purely done in the Filesystem driver stack.<p>Things like Copy-on-Write or Snapshotting, are probably impossible to implement in a backward compatible manner though...",1402464177

I&#x27;m not really a Haskell expert but I worked through Learn You a Haskell for Great Good [2] and found it to be one of the most enjoyable texts about a PL that I&#x27;ve ever found. You can read it all online for free or buy it in real-world book form.<p>As well as those I&#x27;ve worked through SICP in Racket (a lisp), SICP is a classic and well worth taking a look at even if you don&#x27;t want to lisp.<p>I&#x27;ve written in all of the above with Emacs where there&#x27;s great support, I&#x27;m sure there are vim equivalents of the language support, although I&#x27;ll have to rely on some other HNer to point them out.<p>Finally, elements of FP are seeping through into non-fp languages, you can already see them in Java 8, C#, JS, Python, Ruby and more.

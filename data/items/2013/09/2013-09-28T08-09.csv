6461359,comment,6460425,6460739,2,0,lmm,,,"> Most of the criticism of php seems to contrast it with a language plus a framework. If you really want to compare, compare php with ruby or python, not Django or RoR.<p>Why? What difference does that make as a programmer using it? If another language is more modular, and lets libraries handle things that are baked into php, isn&#x27;t that a good thing?<p>> As for php encouraging shitty programming, a good bit of that is that so many more people program in php because its easier to get started with. This does not mean that just because php attracts shitty programmers that it doesn&#x27;t have more or many awesome programmers than languages such as python.<p>Maybe not, but it makes it harder to hire the good ones.",1380358567

At the bottom of the page, the &quot;I accept the terms of&quot; is in black for higher visibility while the &quot;JustFab VIP membership program&quot; is in pink. Now, Black on white is easily more visual than hot pink on white. And since the hot pink is next to the black, its visual contrast reduces even more. Combine that with the fact that users are very highly likely to tick a checkbox, <i>any</i> checkbox with the phrasing &quot;accept the terms&quot; it makes this even more sinister.<p>Regarding link [2] I&#x27;m unable to even find a way to &#x27;escape&#x27; the subscription process.

We used it for a robot we build in the 90s. Everything from the low-level control to the image processing on some fine 386 boards with QNX-native networked IPC.
Too bad that Blackberry was probably the death-spell for it.<p>Also agree on Mach, although somehow NeXT/Apple seem to have managed to make a very good modern OS out of it - with a lot of Mach cruft hidden in the basement. The original NeXTStep Kernel suffered seriously from memory leakage and instability. Unbelievable it became the basis of iOS much later.",1380358019
6461343,comment,6457988,6458852,1,0,xerophtye,,,"Regarding your comment about DOTA2, i see how they have a stake in making this good for rts, but i am not sure how it will work. Me and a cousin hacked an old XBOX (not 360) controller and made it into a usb controller and i tried playing League Of Legends with it... hellishly tough man. I figured it would be more suited to a controller than other rts games because it involves a lot of button action, instead of just the point-and-click of rts games. so while the controller was pretty cool for casting spells, but mouse movement is a pain. because u have to click all over the screen pretty rapidly (MOBA games get pretty intense) and such rapid precision is very VERY hard to obtain from a controller.<p>Maybe its just all of us aren&#x27;t used to doing those tasks with a controller as we are used to it by a mouse (btw long time halo veteran so am more comfortable on controllers for FPS games) but i think a learning curve would prevent high level players from switching to controllers becuase it would (albeit temporarily) really shunt their skills",1380358002

This is handy for things like testing, where eg, a name that would normally resolve to a network API module would instead be resolved to a stub module with pre-canned responses, so any calls to that network API module return consistent responses.<p>Lack of dependency injection in existing JS module systems (you can do it in AMD, but using file paths so it&#x27;s kind of hacky) is cited in the angular docs as the reason Angular includes its own unique module system.<p>Weather people still use AMD or CommonJS or Angular modules after ES6 modules really depends on the feature set of ES6 modules. Hence asking about the feature set of ES6 modules.",1380355940

6461293,comment,6461166,6461249,5,0,lloeki,,,"> CoffeeScript != JavaScript [...] Python != Ruby<p>I beg to differ, CoffeeScript really is JavaScript, <i>written</i> (literally) differently. CoffeeScript is merely a different <i>formal</i> language+grammar[0] that can (and is  almost) translated word for word into the same core. The semantics and underpinnings are exactly the <i>same</i> as with JavaScript.<p>Conversely, were you writing Python with a Ruby-like formal language, it would not give you things that are profoundly Ruby, like blocks or inheritance model (classes and modules, singletons, method resolution) or open classes or require. The opposite is completely true, as writing Ruby in a Python formal language would not give you decorators or (python) modules with their imports and namespaces.<p>CoffeeScript vs JavaScript is literally a bikeshed over the very same core.<p>(That said, I&#x27;m in the CS camp because I find the language requires much less overhead to keep code safe and sound, especially when dealing with not so potent developers that just can&#x27;t seem to understand that yes, <i>var</i> is damn important)<p>[0]: in the mathematical sense, i.e <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language</a>",1380355716

Either way, loose coupling is a concept to strive for as far as reasonably possible - not an absolute requirement. If your code requires something else, then it requires something else. The solution is not to create a <i>new AbstractPretenderOfTotalWorldVisibilityEvenThoughControlFlowIsNowAllOverTheShop()</i> After all, if you carry that tight coupling argument further you could claim that by virtue of writing PHP at all you are tight coupling to a certain, if broad, class of processor architectures.

5209094,comment,5208461,5208461,2,0,haubey,,,"I go to a private school in Florida, so I never had to take the FCATs, or any of the No Child Left Behind tests. When I was in elementary school, I took the ERBs, but the tests meant nothing, so nobody really cared about them that much--or at least the students didn't care. It's hard to remember because that was so many years ago, but my friend who were in public school would always talk about the FCATs, and from what I gathered, teachers taught for the FCATs pretty much the entire year, and almost exclusively for the test in the couple of months proceeding the examination. Meanwhile, I had teachers teaching me the subjects, not the tests.<p>I didn't really have much testing until during middle school, but staring in freshman year I took the PSATs and AP tests. All the PSAT prep we did was vocab in English class, and then in Junior year some brief prep in math. Luckily most of my class sizes were and are small enough that my teachers could give us individual attention if we needed/need it. As a second semester senior, I don't need it anymore. My friends had the FCATs up through 10th grade, after which they changed gears into (P)SAT mode. I'm not sure if their teachers taught for the SATs, or just taught for the class at that point.<p>I've had teachers that teach for the APs and teachers that teach the class topic, and I'm of the opinion that if a teacher teaches for the class, and not for the test, and does it well, then a byproduct of the class should be good grades on the AP test. I'm also of the opinion that the AP Lit and Lang tests need to be remade, because it is incredibly hard to teach critical reading. Math and science AP tests make sense, because there is a right and wrong, but language is much more subjective.<p>Testing is important, however. While the SAT isn't perfect, and while I don't think it will ever be perfect, it's a necessary evil. It's a standard--or as close of a standard that we can probably get to, and so we, and colleges, still need it.",1360699161

Because you would have made less money and gotten less retirement.<p>Now the OP sounds like someone who _deserves_ more money.  But this is impossible in the current education regime, the teachers' unions are adamantly opposed to this sort of thing.  And not entirely without reason, public schools are political institutions with political accountability.  It's only a matter of time before discretion over compensation is used not for institutional purposes but political ones.  Because whether a public school does well or poorly, it will continue to have students and budget to pay salaries.<p>Salaries are currently politically controlled, by unions, to subsidize a large-proportion of subpar workers.  Currently the alternative is administrative political control, where principals and superintendents will vary salaries for who knows what purpose.<p>No Child Left Behind was an effort to improve obviously sub-optimal results by imposing some kind of ""standards"", a regulation of the quality provided by these centrally planned institutions.  It's no surprise that these regulations proved as brain-dead and counter-productive as any other management by regulation.<p>But if we remove the standardized testing, we'll be right back at trusting the discretion of _some_ political entity for the management and control of the schools.  The miserable track records of these entities is what lead to standardized testing in the first place.<p>The root problem in the schools' governance the public schools' effective monopoly on education.  Schools are accountable to _politicians_, not parents, because they get budget from politicians.  Giving parents control of the politicians only changes the politics.  Only when parents control where their children go, and the budget with them, will we move towards governance that actually cares what parents think, and thus acquire a focus on educating kids.  Because only then can administrations have the necessary discretion to pursue real qualities, within a check on the usage of that discretion for its intended purposes.<p>Until we fix that, all the complaints about education and its obvious problems will be so much water under the bridge.  The schools are lousy because no effective actor has an interest in making them good.  Give the parents effective power to hold schools accountable and things will change.  And not before.<p>In the meantime we'll have pious complaints from the politically indoctrinated about how they were forced to do a bad job.  No, sir, not so.

I find it ironic to be correcting an essay of a teacher complaining about the lack of critical thinking in the youth. Or perhaps ""sadly ironic"" would be a better phrase.<p>I think the worst offender is the idea that people who don't do X cannot sit in judgment of those who do X. Our entire system of democracy -- of jurisprudence -- rests on informed citizens making judgments about areas where they spend their money. Nobody gets a free ride. I get to vote on whether the fire station gets a new truck whether or not I've ever been a fireman, whether or not I've ever driven a truck, and whether or not my house has ever been on fire. To do this any other way is insane.<p>The saddest part is that the public education system took a reasonable request -- measure your performance -- and turned it into a bureaucratic nightmare. I hate to be blunt but I'll just say it: these folks shouldn't be trusted with sharp objects, much less our kids' education. They (the administration, the consultants, the ""blob"", the politicians) are part of the problem, not part of the solution. Testing has nothing to do with anything.<p>As sharp as my criticism is, I mean it in the aggregate. There are no bad people here, only a bad, overly complex system that is failing our children. It's a scandal, and removing testing isn't going to do anything but make it less visible. This is very much akin to the attitude of ""Why do we need testers? All they ever do is complain!""<p>I'm not going to continue my analysis because this is an old, tired road, and full of little homespun essays like this which are supposed to make us take sides. I refuse to. We need tests. Period. In my mind once the tests leave, the teachers leave, because I'm not writing a check for something I can't measure. The rest of it? I'm perfectly open to discussions about the kinds of tests, the types of measurements that would be acceptable, and so on. We've taken a good idea and made a monster out of it, yes.

Steve Ballmer claims this a big reason why Microsoft beat IBM when OS/2 was coming out - as IBM rewarded their programmers for more SLOC, so they screwed everything up.<p>If you reward people for good measurements, they'll find ways to screw with the measurements.<p>Big tests mean, the students and teachers will focus on beating the test. They'll teach exam techniques, and stick to what they think will be on the test. It's fairly easy to teach a ""shallow"" way of solving problems, if you can guess the problems. Learning to solve unseen problems is hard - you actually have to understand the material. But most tests won't have a lot of difficult questions, so teachers will focus on getting their class to memorise the algorithm used to solve the basic questions.<p>Rote learning is good, if it's an enabler. Learning your times tables helps you do higher mathematics. But if you only worry about rote learning, then you can go through school without actually understanding what you are doing - you just follow the rules, and hope there aren't too many trick questions. Rote learning can be the foundation of higher learning, but creating nothing <i>but</i> foundations is a waste of effort.<p>It's also a huge waste of resources, as teachers will be spending all their time trying to figure out the test parameters, instead of worrying about whether their students actually understand the material.<p>Finally, there's the opportunity cost. Instead of saying ""the good teachers are the ones which get good test results"", they could do some deeper analysis. How do the ""good"" teachers control their class? What kind of homework do they set? What is the format of their lessons? What can the ""bad"" teachers do, to emulate their success? The ""bad"" teachers mostly just don't know how to teach well. There's probably a few idiots (who can't teach because they don't understand the topic), a few ones whose personality makes them ineffective, and some who are lazy or burnt out. But I bet <i>most</i> teachers would be much more effective if they knew what the ""good"" teachers were up to.<p>If the tests are high stakes, you'll just find that the ""good"" teachers are the ones who care most about gaming the test, not the ones who are actually good teachers. If the tests aren't high stakes, then the good teachers will naturally do well, and it's worth studying how they became so effective.<p>It would be justifiable, if the incentive of high stakes tests was strong enough to actually bring the kids up to a certain level, but I don't think it has. Instead, it just creates bad incentives, and is a distraction from serious quantitative research into teaching.",1360698156

5208976,comment,5208461,5208773,3,0,mazelife,,,"There seems to be a common temptation to chalk student performance solely up to teachers. This despite the fact that there are plenty of things that are out of teacher's control that strongly affect how well a student performs. Here in Maryland, there have been a bunch of recent articles about an alarmingly high percentage of students coming to school without getting adequate nutrition outside of school hours. This has a huge effect on concentration acquisition of new material. In general, socioeconomic and cultural differences between communities have very strong effects on schools; teaching in a school district with highly involved parents gives a huge boost to test scores vs. districts with largely uninvolved parents. Same for rich vs. poor districts, rural vs. suburban districts, etc.<p>Also, what makes you think school administrators have some answers that teachers don't when it comes to how to do the job, or have any idea, really, how to fairly and correctly evaluate teacher performance. Similarly, why do the same people who routinely call for teachers to be fired for poor performing classrooms never seem to want to hold administrators and school boards to account for their poor performance? Why do state and local governments who cut education funding year after year get a pass?<p>I think it's a comforting world view to think that if we could just bust the teacher's unions and start firing people, we'd get real results. But it ignores the fact that the system is broken in may more waysand in many worse waysthan just the teachers.",1360698153

So after ten minutes on wikipedia, I thought I'd share what I learned, to contextualize DeepDuh and kragen's references to economic collapse.<p>Note that I am not an expert, this is just what I gathered from WP and a few other sources.<p>Sweden had a financial crisis in the early 90s (perhaps 1990 to 1993).  This was partly due to a real estate bubble in the 80s which collapsed.  Unemployment ""soared"" (from ~2% to ~10%, which many countries would be fairly happy with).  The central bank at one point set overnight interest rates at 500% (!!!).  Yikes.  At one point the federal deficit was 15% of GDP.  Sweden recovered through the mid-90s.  Their unemployment rate continues to be much higher than pre-1990, but they've run a budget surplus most years since 1998 (everyone is envious).<p>Argentina had a completely unrelated crash, about 10 years later.  It started in 1998 (by which point Sweden was firmly recovered).  There was an IMF bailout, but Argentina couldn't hold up their end of the deal, and the bailout collapsed.  20% economy shrink, 25% unemployment, peso devalued by 75%, rampant poverty, holy crap that sounds really really not fun at all.  In 2002, there was a two week period with five different presidents, what the hell.  Macroeconomic indicators start getting better by 2002; the government has run a small budget surplus for most of the time since then, and unemployment returned to the single digits by 2007 (still worse than a lot of countries, but 7% today is a hell of a lot better than 25% in 1999).<p>And that's what I learned this morning.

The narrative presented suggests that one of the best things Washington Irving did was to have carefully constructed report cards that measured what specifically was being taught to students. The other thing was removing poorly devised standards.<p>That being said, at the end of the episode, one of the teachers interviewed, when asked about whether the temporary success of Washington Irving was due to some hard to measure effect of having good teachers at the right place at the right time had this to say:<p>> It can't just be magic. It can't just be fluky things landing people in the right places, and the chemistry being right. It just can't be that. What's the hope for the rest of the schools? What's the hope for Irving in the future? What's the hope for any school, anywhere?<p>The apparent tension between a need for measurement by standards and a need for teachers' autonomy was palpable and heartbreaking. It is well worth a listen.<p>As for a solution, I can't help but wonder why there is such a focus on making and enforcing standards at higher levels of administration. I imagine it gives a feeling of productivity and control. I wonder if it would be more useful if those bodies focused on studying and informing. Of course studies are harder without standards but it might be worth expending the effort, since it would give a more natural view of what is effective in promoting learning.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/275/two-steps-back"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/275/t...</a>",1360697324

If abc transfers bitcoins to xyz, and the FBI knows that xyz is a drug dealer, then it sees that abc transfers bitcoins to DOM, then it can subpeona dominos records and find the address of someone who purchased drugs from xyz.<p>The assumptions I am making: the FBI knows that xyz is a drug dealer. the FBI knows that DOM is dominos.<p>Are the assumptions wrong?

They have a buttload of locations to choose from, fast networks, and as everyone else has already mentioned: out of this world support. I've even managed to earn a few hundred bucks in referral cash from them.<p>I had a handful of dyno's, a worker, and a few add-ons running my iPhone app's API within Heroku up until about a week ago where I transitioned everything onto a small collection of Linodes in the UK datacenter. We're launching in Europe so it made sense to bring everything closer. If you're comfortable and skilled with a terminal, you can get a lot more bang for your buck with Linode.<p>That being said, I am always interested in trying something new. For a $40 Linode you get 1GB of RAM, with DigitalOcean the same $40 gets you 2GB of RAM and they run on SSD's. I'm going to deploy a copy of my primary API server here to take it for a spin.<p>First impression thus far: fast deployment. From pressing the submit button to shelling in took literally less than a minute.<p>Unfortunately though the latency on the box seems a bit high. There is a bit of lag in the terminal, something I do not experience with Linode's UK datacenter.<p>I'm in Sweden on a 4G modem, here's a traceroute between me and both boxes. DigitalOcean is first, followed by Linode.<p><pre><code>  ### DigitalOcean  Amsterdam Datacenter

Poor Management Team
- Can't effectively execute, have a poor strategy and a poor management team 'breeds' a poor team (A players hire A players etc). A good management team will avoid the other issues below:<p>2. Market Problem - No Market or a Market not large enough. (May have been too soon etc)<p>3. Product Problems - Creating a poor product, so noone uses it.<p>4. Business Model Problem - Acquiring a Customer costs more than Long-term Value<p>5. Poor Execution<p>6. Building A Company around Technology not the Solution - This goes back to point 2 but your users don't care about your stack. Seriously you users do not care about your stack they care if you have a solution to their problem. If you do then you have a potential company but if you focus on building it around technology instead of giving them the solution, you're going to run into a lot of problems.<p>7. Lack Of Focus
- Not saying 'NO' enough<p>8. Running Out Of Money
- Most people raise to get to the next round of funding. That is <i>wrong</i>! If you are raising money etc then you should raise enough money to achieve a set number of milestones which attracts another round of investment from existing/new investors.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html</a>",1360696197

It makes me a target of personal attacks. I am pretty thick skinned and I understand the reasons why people are skeptical of my story, but it simply isn't possible to develop the site in a feedback vacuum. The personal attacks I get in no way help me figure out what I need to talk about or how I need to talk about it. But they make it abundantly clear that it is potentially dangerous to tell my story. I did not spend twelve years getting myself well just to inspire some stressed out mom to shoot me because her child isn't getting well.<p>I will be focusing on lighter topics with more hope of being monetized. Hopefully I can figure out how to shut up about my medical situation. Shutting up isn't one of my strengths but I remain deeply in debt and struggle to get enough to eat every month. I need to figure out how to make money. Trying to make the world a better place has never gotten me anything but pissed on and very few people care at all that getting myself well has cost me so much. I cannot get anyone to understand that this is far cheaper and more effective than conventional treatments, the problem is a) it all came out of my pocket rather than being covered by insurance and b) the single biggest thing I still need is an online income so I do not have to go back to a regular job. A regular job winds up keeping me so sick that it is a net negative income. I have been better off jobless and homeless but my creditors are becoming a bigger and bigger problem.<p>Anyway, I am sure you don't actually care and didn't really want to know. Fwiw: cystic fibrosis currently costs the U.S. about $3 billion (with a B) annually for medical care for a mere 30,000 people. Much of that no doubt comes at taxpayer expense. My debts after getting both me and my son with cf well are a few $10k. One time expense. My condition is now managed with diet and lifestyle. Neither of us takes any medication. But I am a former homemaker. I cannot determine a means to monetize educating people about diet and lifestyle changes which cost a fraction of their current medical bills.

What I have to say about this is that ill prepared college freshmen are a well known phenomenon in the United States. But I think the author of the guest blog post submitted here has not correctly identified the underlying cause of that problem.<p>I have read some of the curriculum standards adopted in various states over the last decade and have examined the item content of some of the No Child Left Behind Act state tests implemented during the same period. The curricula were often quite lousy, and the tests rather poorly constructed. But neither so constrained teachers that we can conclude that they made things WORSE for teachers than before the Act and the associated tests. Teachers are in the classroom to help pupils and students learn something. Defining part of what that something is by no means prevents teachers from teaching more.

(In earlier years I was a classroom teacher of English as a second language or of Chinese as a second language.) My elementary-age pupils come to me for lessons after attending their regular school lessons each week. All my clients have to pay me (my nonprofit program also offers financial aid, up to a full fee waiver, for families with financial need) after already paying their taxes for my state's friendly public schools, and some of my clients come to my program after paying out of pocket for a privately operated classroom school or as a supplement to family homeschooling. I don't give my pupils letter grades, and tests I offer to the pupils are from national voluntary participation mathematics contests, which they take (or not) as one of several reality checks on how they are learning the course material. Parents from a wide variety of school districts have told me that their children do much better on various kinds of school tests after taking my course, even though my course is explicitly NOT test-prep, and even though I don't align my curriculum to the curriculum presupposed by any testing program.<p>Children who learn how to use their brains to think<p><a href=""http://www.epsiloncamp.org/ProblemsversusExercises.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epsiloncamp.org/ProblemsversusExercises.php</a><p><a href=""http://www.epsiloncamp.org/LearningMathematics.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epsiloncamp.org/LearningMathematics.php</a><p>can handle novel problems and are not afraid of tests. Children who are overprotected in school from learning challenges outside the standard curriculum often get scared and shut down when tested, even when tested on the curriculum content they have studied over and over. I'm all about helping young learners be unafraid to take on challenges.

The class size I teach is lower than the typical class size at the schools of regular enrollment of the pupils I teach, and more to btilly's point, my total enrollment of students at a given time is less than the typical student load of a full-time teacher in the local public schools. That's a fair contrast between my situation and theirs. On the other hand, for the first several years of my program I was writing the whole curriculum from the ground up (as no suitable textbooks were avaiable from United States publishers) and sometimes gathering materials from three different countries just to put a lesson plan together.<p>More to the point of teaching large classes, it has been done and done well in many parts of the world. When my wife was growing up in Taiwan, the typical elementary school class size was sixty (60) pupils. An unusually small class would have only fifty (50) pupils enrolled. The differences in school staffing practices and teacher training to make that possible are described in book-length works<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematics-Understanding/dp/0415873843"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematic...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Gap-Improving-Education-Classroom/dp/1439143137"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Gap-Improving-Education-Class...</a><p>but boil down to letting classes be extra large, so that teachers can be scheduled to have joint prep time together each day in which new teachers learn from master teachers and plan lessons together.

How is this better than a homeless applicant getting a pay-as-you-go phone to get a job?<p>I understand that the go-phones are not free, but there is no contract or long term commitment, and that way they will actually have a way to get to their voice mail.<p>This reminds me of a story a little while back about a man who voluntarily limited himself to $25 and the clothes on his back, worked his way to an apartment, a truck, and a decent amount of savings in less than a year.<p>Congratulations Google et. all. I hope this project works out well.",1204179238

He's saying something stupid and stupidly arrogant:<p><i>I would have a hard time imagining hiring a programmer who was still on Windows for 37signals. If you don't care enough about your tools to get the best, your burden of proof just got a lot heavier.</i><p>Whatever. I could find you some old fogeys who wouldn't hire you because you didn't love OpenVMS, and Richard Stallman himself doomed us all to using Unix instead of VMS, which he prefered, because of political constraints. Is DHH using OpenVMS? No? Then he's not using the best tools, and he should seriously consider firing his stupid ass.<p>That he thinks that ability really corresponds to making the polically correct choice in OSes really says more about his hangups than his discernment. As for OSX, it frankly strikes me as the Disney Corp. of the OS world. But that's just my stupid opinion, and I wouldn't hit someone over the head with it.<p>I code on Windows, and deploy to Linux and have never noticed any differences besides file path names and a mysteriously superior performance of MySQL on linux. Hey--I know linux in and out----why am I not using it for a desktop machine? Because Windows is better at that.",1204179138

4077390,comment,4063731,4067387,2,0,sojourner,,,"Sigh. She mentioned his daughter and wife not to engage and escalate, but to remind him he was a human being. Fail.<p>Personally, this guy deserves filming and posting, but a lot of women like being nice. Even with people being utter and complete sociopaths. She gave him some consideration, like a lot of women would. He was drunk, and she kept nicely attempting to redirect his attention away from her. Even now, she is not outing him. She has kept the details vague enough so that few probably could guess who this was.<p>Not everyone enjoys being obnoxious. Even with determined assholes, even with dangerous sociopaths (not saying he was one, just saying in general).<p>That wasn't a tease or a challenge she was throwing out to him. That was a ""I said no. And by the way, you're married, so even if I was attracted to assholes, it would still be a no. And by the way, you're married with children, so even if I was attracted to assholes, it would still be a no. Oh, and by the way, have I mentioned, no? No? Then, let me say it again no.""<p>I think it's interesting that you see her actions as engaging and escalating. I'm sure there are a significant number of males who would agree with you on that. I'm curious, because I've encountered a fair number of guys who don't seem to hear the word ""no"" or follow-up phrases that indicate ""no"": say I'm having a great time in a bar after the conference, and here comes the father with a slut for a daughter looking for some action. Are my only options to get the bartender to throw the guy out, or to leave the bar in order to have this guy -- if not to hear and respond to my ""no"" -- act as if he did? Or is there something magical phrase that a woman can tell a guy where he will hear ""no"" and actually respond as if he respected that?",1339037970

This made almost no difference but did complicate maintenance and require reinventing common Django template tags and filters. I joined the project later and actually made the page much (50x) faster by actually profiling and not executing 8,000 SQL queries.<p>Jinja2 is a great project but I have yet to run into a case where the Django/Jinja debate in any way affected performance significantly.

Obviously this is in the case of using md5/sha1 for your hashing.<p>As an example, find the md5 of a dictionary word and google it, its original value is bound to be in the first or second  result. Now find the md5 of that word and a random string (aka a salt)... google and there shouldn't be any results. and even if there was due to a collision, that password wouldn't work, because it would be resalted prior to the comparison happening.",1339037756

For instance: Django is naive regarding multi-tenancy, something you usually need when building web apps, so you'll have to hack some parts in it; the coupling of most 3rd party apps with the built-in authentication app can also get in the way; etc. If your use case deviates <i>too much</i> from the ""website"" model, using Flask (or just going down to WSGI) for the plumbing and then picking best-of-breed libraries (SQLAlchemy, Jinja, etc.) can pay off in the long run as opposed to going with monolithic Django from the start because, down the line, you'll find you had to hack most parts anyway.",1339036722

Facebook has screwed with privacy policies, and over-complicated application data-sharing settings so many times that I can't imagine funneling money through their platform.  While I trust them with some of my personal information which has value, there's just no trust there for me when it comes to actual money.  Psychologically, they rank below Paypal in my mind ... and that's pretty low.",1339035031

(Although it does look like the article meant ""absorption"" and not ""adsorption"".)<p>Quote for those not in the know:<p>-----<p><<<""Absorb"" refers to a situation where something is taken into a medium, and disappears as a 
consequence (from?). ""Adsorb"" refers to a situation where something gets stuck onto (to?) 
the surface of a medium.<p>We would use ""absorb"" for when light is absorbed by a coloured or opaque object, or for when water is 
soaked into a sponge, or even for when my students manage to ""take in"" some of what I am telling 
them. It is an ordinary English word.<p>""Adsorb"" is used for a very specific situation where molecules get stuck onto a surface. It does not 
occur as a word in ordinary language, outside its scientific meaning. Adsorption is very important, 
because many chemical reactions can go a lot faster when the reacting molecules are adsorbed at a 
surface (reactions of hydrogen gas on the surface of nickel, for example), or chemical reactions can be 
prevented by the presence of a barricading adsorbed layer on the surface (aluminium failing to react 
with air, for example), or impurities can be removed from a solution by adsorbing them onto a finely 
divided solid (activated charcoal for decolorizing solutions, or for medicinal use, for example).>>>",1339034958

I would argue that it has less constraints, however I assume he is arguing that text editors are better which implies that they have more constraints. The same goes for Pen&Paper vs digital notes. Surely being able to write in any direction at any size with any style as well as draw means there are less constraints than simply typing a digital note.

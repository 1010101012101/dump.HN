Then in 1961, IBM executives decided to set limits on how much commission a sales person could receive each year. It did not take even three weeks for Perot to reach his yearly maximum, which caused him great frustration. Additionally, Perot had some new business concepts that he wanted IBM to implement. IBM management was extremely resistant to trying his new ideas. Frustration related to the cap on his commission and the insult of deciding not to implement his business ideas, resulted in Perot leaving IBM in 1962 to start his own company. His company, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), was based on the very ideas that IBM rejected.""<p>Don't get me wrong, capitalism is not perfect; but it does favor creativity, risk taking, and persistence (in the face of adversity).",1203991128

123535,comment,123060,123060,0,0,fiaz,,,"I would like to know if words sufficiently similar sounding to ""GO"" and ""STOP"" evoke the same impulse in the circuitry to accordingly output the voltage.  I'm guessing that they will if the signals are sufficiently similar.<p>There is a difference between symbol and signal; as impressive as this story is, it is important to make this distinction because the article seemed to imply processing on the symbol/semantic level as opposed to the signal level (which I am assuming is the dominant modality of interpreting the words ""stop"" and ""go""); there were also hints of awareness as in:<p><i>""It appears that evolution made use of some physical property of these cells—possibly a capacitive effect or electromagnetic inductance—to influence a signal passing nearby. Somehow, it seized on this subtle effect and incorporated it into the solution.""</i><p>As an example of the difference of symbol/signal, a chimpanzee can be trained to obey traffic lights according to what they represent.  The chimp will no doubt have the capacity to do what the lights command, but what would it do if it saw a red light while in the middle of an intersection?  Would it be able to separate the symbology of ""don't stop within the intersection"" with the signal of ""stop now"" and end up either inside the intersection or directly after the intersection obediently waiting for another light to show up within its field of vision to tell it to continue?<p>The fact that he's used the process to create controllers for robots does not mean, to me at least, that there is the beginning of awareness forming at this stage; the controllers are more likely computed as opposed to rationalized; I suppose you could say that genetic algorithms are a form of rationalization, but feel free to show me how this is the case.<p>This is nonetheless an amazing break through in that we have what looks to be an ""emergent entity"" that responds to commands and the creator is baffled about how this happened.  I'm hesitant to use the word ""evolved entity"" at this point because I don't see an imperative drive for survival for the sake of survival in the same way members of the five kingdoms display.  I think the distinction is relevant given the nature of what has emerged and how it emerged (through genetic programming which uses the concept of evolution as a schema to describe the process accurately).",1203990099

For real dev tasks I use Jira, everything else goes into iGTD:  Phone calls I have to make (call mom, return recruiters message), errands I need to run (pickup dry cleaning, drop off library books), work tasks (write arch doc for phase 5, review code for project X), personal projects, home tasks (run laundry, spent an hour reading a book and drinking tea), etc...

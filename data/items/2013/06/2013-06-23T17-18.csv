For me, it doesn&#x27;t destroy credibility and legitimacy at all. Nor does it smell of defection. The irony, however, is what is most tangible. If we have, through the actions of our intelligence agencies, reached a point where American citizens must flee the country and take refuge in a traditionally maligned foreign power to effectively <i>protect</i> the Constitution and the People, it is a clarion call for the need to make a full stop, publicly work out these problems, and get ourselves back on the right track. If protecting constitutional and human rights requires one to flee a nation that champions those causes publicly, but prosecutes their defenders privately, we have a serious problem.",1372010272

Of course, there is no clear boundary between &quot;obvious&quot; and &quot;needs proof&quot;.
However, I found that most people are quite able to judge whether it would be helpful to include a source for a statement. 
I think that within most discoursive communities there is an implicit consensus on when a statement needs an explanation or a supporting source for it to be accepted [1].<p>Regarding the author&#x27;s &quot;duty&quot;: Maybe I should have called it &#x27;courtesy&#x27; instead.
On the other hand, if I am not completely mistaken, HN was intended as a forum for constructive and thoughtful low-noise discussions. 
As I want to profit from these discussions, I personally see it as my duty to make my comments as helpful as possible. 
I would argue that including source for statements more often is beneficial to a discussion than not.

5928447,comment,5927843,5928149,43,0,avar,,,"We&#x27;ve been working on moving away from rsync for our code syncing to
using Git where I work.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there aren&#x27;t uses for rsync, but your dismissal of git
as not being suitable for a &quot;true production deployment system&quot; isn&#x27;t
supported in any way. And stating that rsync was &quot;specifically made
for this kind of thing&quot; without comparing any of the trade-offs
involved is just appealing to authority.<p>Some things you may have not considered:<p><pre><code>  * rsync is meant to sync up *arbitrary filesystem trees*, whereas
   with Git you&#x27;re snapshotting trees over time.

   When you transfer content between two Git repositories the two ends
   can pretty much go &quot;my tree is at X, you have Y, give me X..Y
   please&quot;. You get that as a pack, then just unpack it in the
   receiving repository.

   Whereas with rsync even if you don&#x27;t checksum the files you still
   have to recursively walk the full depth of the tree at both ends
   (if you&#x27;re doing updates), send that over the wire etc. before you
   even get to transferring files.

 * Since syncing commits and actually checking them out are two
   different steps you can push out commits (without checking them
   out!) to your production machines as they&#x27;re pushed to your
   development branches.

   Then deploying is just sending a message saying &quot;please check out
   such-and-such SHA1&quot; and the content will already be there!

 * You mentioned in another post here that rsync has --delay-updates,
   this is just like &quot;git reset --hard&quot; (but I&#x27;ll bet Git&#x27;s is more
   efficient). With Git you can do the transfer of the objects and the
   checking out of the objects as separate steps.

 * It&#x27;s way easier for compliance/validation reasons to not get the
   data out of Git, since you can validate with absolute certainty
   that what you have at a given commit is what you have deployed
   (just run &quot;git show&quot;). If you check the files out and then sync
   them with some out-of-bound mechanism you&#x27;re back to comparing
   files.
</code></pre>
Edit: One thing I forgot, it&#x27;s distributed. Which gives you a lot of
benefits. Consider this problem, you have 1000 servers running your
code and you&#x27;ve decided that you want to deploy <i>now</i> from a staging
server.<p>Having trying to rsync to 1000 servers at once from one box (the nave
implementation with rsync) would take forever and overload that one
box, especially if you wanted to take advantage of pre-syncing things
on every commit so the commit will already be there if you want to
roll out (constant polling and/or pushing).<p>You can mitigate this by having intermediate servers you push to, but
then you&#x27;ve just partitioned the problem, what if you need to swap out
those boxes, they go down etc.<p>With Git you can just configure each of the 1000 boxes to have 3 other
boxes in the pool as a remote. Then you seed one of them with the
commit you want to rollout. The content will trickle through the graph
of machines, any one machine going down will be handled gracefully,
and if you want to rollout you can just block on something that asks
&quot;do you have this SHA1 yet&quot; returning true for all live machines
before you &quot;git reset --hard&quot; to that SHA1 everywhere.",1372008678

And yet, it doesn&#x27;t hold water. For one thing, teaching kids how to synthesize information, explain how a process works, is quite valuable and not at all soul-crushing. &quot;To learn is to teach,&quot; they say, and writing papers about what you&#x27;ve learned is, essentially, teaching about what you&#x27;ve learned. It&#x27;s a good thing.<p>And of course if you generalize the argument, then students could be excused from learning entirely. How &quot;soul-crushing&quot; is it for a piano student to try to play tude in C major, when there are countless recordings of it being played perfectly, and with great genius? Following in the steps of great thinkers and doers is not soul-crushing, because you&#x27;re walking in the footsteps of greatness. Those notes are the right notes. You play it badly, but <i>you&#x27;re playing it</i>. It is humbling, though. The difference between soul crushing and humility is that for the latter, there&#x27;s every reason to believe that one day you too could be great.<p>The other good thing about writing papers is that, no matter how expository it may be, there is <i>always</i> opportunity for viewpoint. Even if the viewpoint expressed has to do with how best to organize the material, every paper is a chance for self-expression.<p>The reason students don&#x27;t like writing papers is that it&#x27;s really hard. It&#x27;s hard to consume the information, and it&#x27;s hard to organize it, especially if you&#x27;re not used to organizing information. But you have to make mistakes, write papers that are all jumbled and confused, before you can get better. Those jumbled, bad papers are clearly worse than the source material, and the teacher is there with her red pen marking the next step toward greatness.",1372008609

5928325,comment,5924832,5927006,1,0,mtts,,,"> English grammar is not simple. It has what (12?) tenses. (on the contrary Russian has basically 3 tenses) And it&#x27;s full of exceptions. Why &#x27;I see&#x27;, but I&#x27;m looking at you. There&#x27;s simply no reason. It&#x27;s an exception. Thousands of them.<p>This is actually not such a great example. Yes, English can <i>express</i> 12 tenses, but it doesn&#x27;t have them in the sense that Russian, Italian or Czech do with affixes and declensions and what have you.<p>> Let&#x27;s just take 2 sounds. etc<p>In this, of course you&#x27;re right, but I didn&#x27;t dispute this fact: English is a Germanic language and as such has a much larger number of phonemes than most other languages in the world (though it has far fewer than other Germanic languages, such as Dutch, Swedish and Norwegian, which have an - by global standards - insane number of vowels). Like I said, English isn&#x27;t ideal, but it could have been worse. German, Polish or French (which has the added bonus of written French and spoken French being essentially two entirely different languages)would have been much worse. Indonesian/Malay, Tok Pisin or Swahili would have been much better in this regard, but alas, we have English.<p>> &quot;In general, English spelling does not reflect* the sound changes in the pronunciation of the language that have occurred since the late fifteenth century.&quot;<p>Right. The ortography of English is atrocious and difficult to learn, even for native speakers. So there&#x27;s that. It&#x27;s definitely a point against English and it&#x27;s a matter of taste whether this detracts significantly from its good points.<p>> Artificial != bad. We have tons of artificial things in our life that are awesome!<p>This, I think, is our true bone of contention. My argument is Esperanto brings very little to the table an organically developed Western European creole doesn&#x27;t already have. You&#x27;re free to disagree, of course, which brings me to:<p>> Esperanto is several times faster to learn than English for anybody (given similar conditions). Linguists say it and I second that based on experience.<p>Do you have sources for this? I&#x27;d be very interested to see the research on this. I would think the chief difficulty in learning a language that is wildly different from your native language is the fact that it&#x27;s, well, wildly different from your native language, but I am  very much open to evidence that learning a language from an entirely different language family than your own becomes easier if that language is rigorously structured and cleaned up instead of being merely an example of a worse is better organic jumble.",1372007322

All of those things deserve debate - even on foreign surveillance the NSA should not have a free hand IMHO - they&#x27;re supposed to <i>target</i> enemies of the US, not engage in blanket surveillance - that&#x27;s a dangerous and massive expansion of their powers and in the hands of a president like Nixon would be truly terrifying. It also undermines the position of the US in the world and allows nations like China to indulge in cyberattacks with absolutely no moral high ground for the US.<p>Re where Snowdon goes, I think that has far more to do with pragmatism that his wish-list of most desired countries - from his own words I think he would have preferred to stay in the US and fight this if he felt he&#x27;d be given a fair trial, but that has been made impossible by the calls of traitor from the current administration (what they mean of course is traitor to the NSA and administration, not to the country, but those two are confounded).<p>The alternative interpretation of his actions is that a champion of human rights has been obliged to flee the US and seek refuge with enemies of the US, because he risks imprisonment without bail, torture and indefinite detention at home (all of those have been used in the war on terror in the last decade). It is quite credible that he wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to state his case or argue his defence as Ellsberg did, and in fact Ellsberg agrees with him on that, and the treatment of Manning justifies his fears.

I&#x27;m not sure about how git works in detail, but are repository updates even atomic?<p>When I deploy my website, I use a different approach: My webroot is just a symlink. My deployment script exports the repository to a directory with a unique name for every commit. When the export succeeds, the symlink is updated to point to the new directory.<p>The advantage: Changing to the new version is instantaneous. If something should go wrong, I can immediately revert by changing the symlink back to the old dir.",1372006876

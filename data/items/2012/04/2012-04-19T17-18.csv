Today the estimated number of users is 30 million.

He is a Web Designer, and not simply a designer; so he should use the best practices<p>1- Use the HTML5 Doctype<p>2- Removes unnecessary space (empty lines and spaces). Why the extra bits?<p>3- JavaScript, I see that you are loading a good chunk of JavaScript in the HEAD and you are loading a bunch of it in the end.

It was a collector classic and was fetching upwards of $300 in the secondary market. We didn't buy a copy, we didn't ""pirate"" one either.<p>The publisher saw the high price as proof there was still a demand for the book and produced another printing. We paid full price for it, around 15 bucks, I think. It's a cute book, I'm glad I have it, I wouldn't have wanted to pay $300 for it, though.<p>One could make the case that if everyone could just ""pirate"" the book because it was financially unavailable, then the publisher would never bother doing a re-issue.<p>More broadly, I think that respecting copyright holders (and the rule of law) means that sometimes you don't get exactly what you want exactly when you want it.",1334858365

And yes the FBI will no doubt try to use this to 'fix' the issue of having to get warrants for gps tracking, which folks will watch out for, but the 'good' parts of an EDR are that you can find out just what the heck happened post 'event.'

Another benefit of the Senate legislation is that it applies to <i>all</i> EDRs in cars, so folks who put EDRs into your car today and <i>do</i> sell information to third parties (I'm looking at you OnStar) will also be bound by this.<p>So a more reasonable story might have been:<p>EDRs are in a lot of vehicles now, they represent both a privacy threat and a potential benefit.

Namely, content needs to be encrypted from the time it leaves their server's to the time it is decoded by the screen.  The reason for this is simple, if they achieve this goal, they can argue that anyone who provides an unencrypted copy of content must have violated the DMCA (which has provision against tampering with encryption).  Whether the technologies have cracked (the article points out the HDCP has been) or whether the provider ever prosecutes isn't the point, the content providers feel they need to reserve their rights at any cost.<p>Many folks (techdirt included) argue that piracy is just marketing.  For instance, it allows HBO to reach an audience they wouldn't reach otherwise.  They even speculate that the Game of Thrones ratings bump was due to piracy.  While that may (or may not) be true, in most industries, companies control when, where and much to spend on marketing.<p>For HBO (or any content provider) all these decisions come down to economics and how they can maximize their profits.  In this new case (adding HDCP to their streams) they probably judged that the number of customer's they'd loose was pretty small and making the change would allow them to further their strategic goals.",1334856954

Kind of ""Nothing to see here, folks. Please move along.""<p>What we've learned through repeated experience is that data collection always leads to some future configuration that we are not happy with. Maybe it's advertisers tracking our every move on the web. Maybe it's the police getting all of our cell phone records simply by filling out a form. Perhaps it's the government tracking all international calls. Maybe it's the cops taking COTS GPS devices and using them to track cars without a warrant. Whatever. The pattern is clear: one day we start collecting data. Somewhere down the road somebody starts using that data in a way we do not like. Big Data is simply too attractive to too many entities to leave alone.<p>While the cops angle is the one that's most emotional, my money says the real players behind the scenes here are the insurance companies. Initially, the spin will be for accident litigation, but within a few years they'll have ""collecting any relevant data"" clauses in all their new car insurance policies. And then they'll be able to see exactly how you drive. Insurance companies are already trying to do this voluntarily. I think Progressive has some kind of Orwellian name for it like ""Safe Driver Program"" or something. Don't know. All I know is that whenever I see their commercials it reminds me of how stupid they think their customers are.<p>It's a fair cop to say that many of these stories are overblown, emotional, and manipulative. But that's a far cry from saying they are useless. The problem here is trying to guess a future world in which this goes south. For every ten guesses, maybe one is close. So looking at it from that angle, what a terrible track record! But looking at it from the proper (in my opinion) angle, the problem is simply one of style. Nobody wants to read a long-winded discussion of the problems here, but everybody will click on ""The police are checking your underwear every night using your iPad!"" stories. Simply because that's the nature of the business doesn't mean there aren't also serious concerns.",1334855220

10134362,comment,10127208,10127996,0,0,asgard1024,,,"> If humans are being replaced with computers, then there will be need for fewer managers, supervisors etc. This would cause a decline in demand for people with &quot;human skills&quot; also.<p>Here&#x27;s my answer to this paradox. The humans vs machines is just another &quot;good old boys club&quot;. Of course humans don&#x27;t want to relinquish control and be managed by machines, they are not silly. So they create another layer of &quot;soft skills&quot; which prevents from machines (or people who understand them) taking over.<p>Take a high-frequency trading company as an analog. The job is done by computers and technicians running them. Still, the CEO and investors into this are probably better paid than those technicians, and make all the important decisions. (In fact, today you could probably create a completely self-managed HFT company that would just put all the profit into hiring more technicians who manage its algorithms.)<p>And I think this was always the case in human history (although not against machines, just against other social groups); and many technical people here seem to be in denial of this reality. What we can do though is to attempt to change this, but it will require political, not technological, solutions (that is people skills).",1440752228

They&#x27;re just doing it using more sophisticated algorithms instead of fingerprints.  Traditional anti-virus software trying to match file signatures is not effective against 0-day attacks.<p>What&#x27;s newsworthy is that a vendor was able to convince important people (e.g. AV-TEST Institute) that algorithms scanning for anomalies is equivalent to, or stronger than, traditional disk-scanning.  However, it doesn&#x27;t look like they&#x27;ve convinced the credit-card industry yet.  They&#x27;re the ones who determine PCI DSS compliance.  However, PCI DSS may not apply to Netflix.<p>Interpreting the story as an <i>ongoing progression</i> of anti-virus technology, it means the industry won&#x27;t &quot;die&quot; at all.  They&#x27;re just retooling themselves with more algorithmic approaches.  Maybe Symantec will add algorithms and also be included in the changing industry of fighting viruses.",1440752215

If you are the sole user of the laptop, then having your root password be different from your LUKS password has no meaningful security advantages.<p>Your root password is much easier to steal than your disk encryption password.  Trick the user into running a program that does &#x27;alias sudo=evil-sudo&#x27; >> ~/.bashrc, or sniff it from an unrelated X11 window, or use a microphone.

10134269,comment,10134037,10134037,0,0,dvt,,,"Read the article earlier today and I just read it again because the first time I honestly didn&#x27;t really get its point. After reading it a second time, here are my thoughts:<p>> In the Vanity Fair article, David Buss, a University of Texas psychology professor, claimed that apps like Tinder contribute to “a perceived surplus of women,” among straight men, which in turn leads to more hookups and fewer traditional relationships. Here’s the thing: This surplus of women is not “perceived” at all but very, very real.<p>Okay, so according to Mr. Birger, we have we have a surplus of women. He fails to qualify it here, but later we realize this is true of only a few places (Manhattan, for example) and not necessarily true in the general case. In fact, women generally outnumber men in college[1].<p>> As I note in my book, today’s lopsided gender ratios “add up to sexual nirvana for heterosexual men, but for heterosexual women — especially those who put a high priority on getting married and having children in wedlock — they represent a demographic time bomb.”<p>I don&#x27;t really get this. It smells of thinly veiled anti-male sentiment (&quot;sexual nirvana for heterosexual men&quot;) -- as if women don&#x27;t enjoy casual sex? It also seems that Birger doesn&#x27;t think relationship goals are discussed by both parties. Men aren&#x27;t the only ones that &quot;decide&quot; where a relationship heads -- Vanity Fair disagrees, but I frankly think that&#x27;s complete nonsense and does a disservice to young women. Furthermore, women aren&#x27;t indentured -- they can leave an unfavorable relationship at any time. Specifically, the Vanity Fair article was referring to <i>hookup culture</i>. Presumably, if you want a long term relationship (and put a &quot;high priority on getting married and having children in wedlock&quot;), you won&#x27;t meet someone on Tinder Friday and have sex with them on Saturday. Even a dating neophyte can tell you that much.<p>> Regardless of orientation, obviously not all women place a premium on marriage, or even monogamy. But for the straight, college-educated woman who is eager to get married and start a family, the question becomes how best to deal with a dating market in which men have too much leverage.<p>Again, the Vanity Fair article specifically dealt with <i>Tinder</i>. You put a high premium on long term relationships and wedlock? Don&#x27;t use Tinder. There&#x27;s OKCupid, Match.com, eHarmony, and PoF; most of these are aimed towards relationship-building and not necessarily thrill-seeking. Tinder is primarily a hookup app. Kind of how the Silk Road was mainly used for buying and selling drugs. Sure, there are edge cases, but it&#x27;s important to see the salient point here.<p>> Unsurprisingly, men tend to be less — I’ll say it — promiscuous when women are more scarce.<p>This is a (stupid, and again, thinly-veiled anti-male) truism. Female scarcity by definition implies less male sex going on. Mr. Birger managed to say absolutely nothing while at the same time making it Tweet-worthy.<p>But really the article fails at a much more basic level. Some people are looking for relationships while others are looking for hook-ups. Without quantifying these two segments (and the cross-pollination between these groups), Birger&#x27;s claims are meaningless. At least the Vanity Fair article didn&#x27;t particularly try to make any sweeping generalization and was somewhat of a showpiece: an excellently written, wonderfully researched, and fun to read collection of interviews. Birger&#x27;s, on the other hand, makes claims it can&#x27;t possibly prove and reduces some of the most complex human social interaction to &quot;leverage&quot; and &quot;priorities&quot;. I think he took the Vanity Fair article a bit too seriously.<p>Finally, the entire Birger article makes a huge assumption: that most women are interested in a &quot;boyfriend&quot; rather than a hookup. Without the data to back this assumption up, we&#x27;re stuck in the middle of nowhere.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nber.org/digest/jan07/w12139.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nber.org/digest/jan07/w12139.html</a>",1440750440

You can say allot about Flash but atm it&#x27;s performance and stability are better than WebGL in it&#x27;s current state.<p>The problem with WebGL is that it pretty much inherited the mess of OpenGL every driver version on every GPU can implement different feature set of it (similar to the extension mess of OpenGL in Nvidia and ATI minidrivers at the time) which results in Browsers having to maintain blacklist/whitelists[1] for a very large array of hardware and software combinations (Chrome currently isn&#x27;t maintaining a driver version based list other than a cut off date for certain drivers which also causes problems if you are running old hardware and the best drivers for it are considered out of date by Google).<p>WebGL it self is also not implemented in the same manner across different browsers Chrome and FF for example have quite a different blacklist/whitelist for WebGL, I don&#x27;t know if this because of different in browser implementation or because of they are simply encountering different issues and adjusting accordingly.<p>The worse thing I&#x27;ve encountered so far is WebGL on switchable graphics (e.g. Nvidia Optimus) enabled laptops, some features might switch the GPU arbitrarily even mid execution which causes the whole thing to implode..<p>[1]<a href=""https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/gpu/+/master/config/software_rendering_list_json.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/gpu/+/master/...</a><p>Whats worse is that WebGL can actually crash your graphics driver and if it&#x27;s bad enough than Windows can&#x27;t recover the kernel mode driver it&#x27;s a complete kernel panic.
This doesn&#x27;t happen often but if you want to do it you can do it sadly too easily, Chrome/FF chase known DOS cases with WebCL quite well but they really don&#x27;t catch all of them and if that feature isn&#x27;t blacklisted for your setup well you can crash a machine with a single pixel draw ;)<p>And the introduction of WebCL would probably lead to some of the nastiest RCE vulnerabilities you can imagine soon enough you are allowing people to execute general purpose code directly on the metal and interact with Kernel mode components.

When we can&#x27;t manage our levels, the brain shuts down. In order to prevent this we grow up paranoid, watching for every sign. Stress, faulty needles etc. all effect us. 
Knowing that we can theoretically prevent nerve damage (almost every person with 10+ years diabetes gets it) and other serious conditions (kidney failure, blindness) and practically not being able to do anything is very depressing.",1440750092

10134227,comment,10134037,10134137,0,0,m12k,,,"Tinder&#x27;s swipe mechanic, while incredibly superficial, helps with the biggest problem with OkC and other traditional dating sites: The experience is horrible for women. Their inbox receives a torrent of marriage offers and incredibly explicit sex offers from men they have no interest in. Tinder&#x27;s reciprocality system, where you both have to show interest before a chat is even possible, solves this elegantly. The downside IMO is that it&#x27;s incredibly hard to find someone that you have more than a physical interest in. OkC&#x27;s matchmaking questions and match% system is actually a really good solution to this. I think there&#x27;s a business opportunity in combining the two - enforce the reciprocality like Tinder does, but have matchmaking questions, so it can try to pair you with more likely matches first. (OkC actually has a feature like this, but when they don&#x27;t enforce its use, it&#x27;s entirely meaningless). Of course this would begin compromising Tinder&#x27;s other big advantage, the incredibly easy setup (it doesn&#x27;t really _feel_ like making a dating profile, so it attracts a much wider audience) - but I think it&#x27;d be worth experimenting with nonetheless.",1440749332

They are usually less concerned with upholding traditional gender roles, and often can speak freerer.<p>However you&#x27;re right that the societal filter can apply. If a conservative older, more powerful, man asks a woman (e.g. a 40 y.o. boss asking a 20 y.o. new employee), then yes, sometimes people don&#x27;t tell the boss everything.<p>A general advise of &quot;don&#x27;t listen to women!&quot; is very disturbing.",1440749031

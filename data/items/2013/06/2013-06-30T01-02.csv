5964407,comment,5963891,5963891,6,0,cupcake-unicorn,,,"It is very unfortunate that BFL is getting publicity over this article - they&#x27;re a company with a terrible reputation and have treated their customers horribly. I got bitten by the mining bug recently and was stupid enough to almost buy one without doing proper research, until I ran into an issue with checkout. They were ridiculously unprofessional and rude dealing with it, and slow to get back to me, and that was a blessing, as I realized how worthless it was in the end.<p>What it&#x27;s probably not going to say in this article is: People have been waiting to have one shipped to them for over a year. Use a calculator to find out how much lost profit that is. If you buy one now, or even if one is shipped to you in the next few months (unlikely, unless you ordered it 10 months ago), it will be basically worthless due to more and more ASIC hardware coming out on the market.<p>If you must go into mining, check out some of the custom Klondike K16 Boards that are being developed. These will be shipped much faster than anything BFL ships out, but even then you&#x27;re looking at a few months lead time, which could be significant in terms of increasing difficult and return value.",1372557496

BFL estimates they will clear the backlog of orders by September of this year, but their estimates are notoriously bad so take that with a grain of salt.<p>These units don&#x27;t perform worse than what I originally ordered, in fact they hash at a rate that is 24% higher than what I ordered (5.6GH/s vs 4.5GHs).

Mining these currencies usually offer an extra 30-50% over mining bitcoin directly and can be sold for bitcoin or USD on various exchanges.<p>As an example for a $300 ATI 7950 card that generates ~600kH/s scrypt you will generate $1.33 per day in litecoins vs ~450MH/s with SHA256 which currently generates $1.01 per day in bitcoin.<p>With the onslaught of ASIC hardware coming though it&#x27;s not clear what&#x27;s going to happen with GPU mining.  As more people move to the other currencies they will become less profitable to mine and could get to the point where they cost more in electricity than they generate in profit.

For example, a simulation of a washing machine is not a washing machine. But, a simulation of a calculator _is_ a calculator. A realistic simulation of a calculator would look just like one of those calculator programs you have on your computer or your mobile phone. And those programs actually _are_ calculators - because we use them to do calculations for us just like we used to use real calculators to do calculations for us.<p>The question of whether simulated pain is the same as actual pain is equivalent to the question of whether pain is an aspect of an information processing system (which I think it is), or whether it is something else.<p>An information processing system that &quot;feels pain&quot;, will be less and less inclined to do something that is &quot;painful&quot;. This will be part of the decision making process of that system. If the system is somehow able to &quot;ignore&quot; its own painful feelings, it will end up making bad decisions - just like a person who can&#x27;t feel pain ends up making bad decisions. Typically people who don&#x27;t feel pain suffer accumulated injuries and generally fail to look after themselves, even when they intellectually know that their insensitivity to pain puts them at risk, and as a result they become disabled and die at a younger age than those of us who suffer pain in the normal manner.",1372554298

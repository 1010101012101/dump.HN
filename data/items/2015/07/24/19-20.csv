9944772,comment,9940202,9940202,0,0,Yhippa,,,"> Believe it or not, the Content Services team at Mozilla is thinking about way more than just &quot;plunking ads into Firefox&quot;. Like, what if we actually accepted the fact that ads are a way of funding the web at large, and browsers themselves offered built-in mechanisms to support advertising that respect privacy & performance? Yeah, that&#x27;s a bit of a change from browsers&#x27; traditional neutrality. But, it could be a better deal for publishers and users together.<p>I&#x27;m curious as to how that could ever be done.  I feel that it&#x27;s almost impossible without somehow getting user information.  I feel the trend is that ads are going to continue to be tuned to people and aspects about them.  Maybe fully homomorphic encryption can do that without violating privacy but that&#x27;s a long way off.<p>> Here&#x27;s another idea: Almost a year ago, I heard the notion of &quot;Subscribe 2 Web&quot; at Mozilla. The gist is that you&#x27;re worth about $6.20 per month across publishers via advertising revenues. What if you paid that much into an account yourself every month and used a mechanism built into your browser to distribute that money? Yeah, it&#x27;s micropayments, but I find it interesting that these folks came up with a specific dollar amount that doesn&#x27;t sound terrible.<p>It exists.

For example CAN does not have a notion of source, it&#x27;s really in the abstract a whole lot like a bus, just with cables.<p>So one reason the infotainment might want to send commands is to that station/song information appears in the instrument cluster.<p>Now I agree it would be really smart if there was another module sitting between the the radio and the IPC with two sides and it filters both ways. Also that gateway has logic like, I have power but it&#x27;s been less than a minute, this packet has the right code, sure I will let this reflash happen. In fact such devices exist (except they are more trusting).<p>The thing is though that the radio tends to have the most impressive CPU of all in the car, so there is pressure to add that in there (I mean there was one manufacturer that had tried to merge BCM, TCM, telematics, and DIC all into the head unit with a roughly 400MHz cpu, so that gives oyu an idea), logic like &#x27;yeah maybe, we won&#x27;t be sending that in fact.&#x27; But once it is hacked, all bets are off, it can even DOS the bus. The other aspect is you just want they crap from Delco to work with the stuff from TRW and the gateway is getting in the way and yo don&#x27;t want to expend the resources to figure-out why.<p>When it was all a wired network, it did not really matter so much.",1437767959

9944750,comment,9944273,9944273,0,0,codegeek,,,"first, let me congratulate that you are admitting to a problem that you have and looking to do something about it. A lot of us don&#x27;t even get to that stage. So you have already taken the first step when you are asking for help.<p>&quot;I have no social support, no work support, and am generally feeling isolated and defeated&quot;<p>This is probably the biggest cause. We are born to be social even though the social&#x27;ness can vary a lot. Isolation is a huge problem which can cause things like depressions, negative attitude etc. I will say work on fixing this first. Forget about projects, ideas etc even though they are important but not your immediate concern at this time.<p>Do something out of your comfort zone. This is the biggest challenge when trying to improve oneself. I personally struggle with this a lot but doing things that you normally don&#x27;t do will change your perspective in many things. One small example: Force yourself to go meet random people at random places. Talk to them. See what it does. Don&#x27;t expect any outcome though. just do it. Get involved in some social sports if you can. Go play tennis with a stranger or even squash or whatever you can. Don&#x27;t worry if you suck at it. That&#x27;s not the point. Call up a family member randomly whom you don&#x27;t meet often and ask them to meet. Next time when you get upset at a stranger because they cut you off on the road, think that they may be in a hurry due to family emergency. Think Positive. Force yourself into it. It may seem silly to do this but it grows on you.<p>Oh, and try to spend time with people who have positive outlook in life and can influence you. Who you hangout with matters a lot. We like to learn from our company. It is just how we are wired.<p>All these may not be the magic wand but doing things differently than what you do currently will be a start. There is no binary answer to all this of course but just trying to give you some insights.",1437767799

In a PWR, the working fluid and the fluid circulating past the reactor core are separated via heat exchangers in the steam generator, so that&#x27;s probably the only widely used reactor type that could do distillation-based desalination without heavy modification.<p>But probably the most useful way to go about doing it is to keep the rest of the reactor as it is, and just attach the reverse osmosis desalinator pumps to the same driveshaft as the electricity generator.  Even though boiling and condensing water is an integral part of steam engine operation, it really works best when that water has been completely demineralized already.  Otherwise, your boiler fills with salt sludge, and your condenser gets clogged with mineral scale.<p>You&#x27;re saving efficiency by taking out the two conversions between electrical and mechanical work and the transmission loss between generator and pump motor.

Basic has the reputation of being easy for beginners and hobbyists but properly written code in a recent OOP dialect of Basic doesn&#x27;t look <i>too</i> different from code written in any object-oriented  Algol-derived language.

Other possible reasons they get the sort of following they do could be that<p>1. Those environments are easy to install and create your first project with.<p>2. They start you with an IDE, so compiling and running your first code is only a matter of pressing a single key or clicking a single button.<p>3. They ship a &quot;fun-oriented&quot; standard library.

9944493,comment,9942889,9943556,0,0,Paul-ish,,,">This is a red herring: this idea that the user will already have a cached copy of CDN-hosted jQuery is bogus. Even for a common library like jQuery: the number of versions of jQuery that are in use is likely above 50, and the number of popular CDNs that host jQuery is surely above 10. So we are hoping that the user will have a cached copy of that exact jQuery version from that exact CDN.<p>I wonder if it might be a good idea to have a hash attribute for external resources. For example, I might include jquery by including<p><pre><code>  <script src=&quot;//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js&quot; sha256=&quot;ecb916133a9376911f10bc5c659952eb0031e457f5df367cde560edbfba38fb8&quot;></script>\n</code></pre>\nI calculate the hash on my end. This ensures that if code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js is changed, the browser can know that the resource was tampered with or the developer made a mistake, and not load that resource. Also, if the browser sees a hash for a resource it has cached, it can load that cached resource, even if it is hosted at a different location. This seems better for both security and performance, but does put a slightly higher burden on the developers.<p>EDIT: This seems to cover what I am talking about: <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/</a>",1437765504

My experience disagrees with this.  I spent 6 months studying in Germany and did not see a significant difference vs how people drink in the US.  Germans, Italians, Poles, etc. all binge drank, with the primary difference being what they consumed most of the time.  When I was in London, I saw plenty of Brits binge drinking as well.<p>It&#x27;s commonly claimed that US drinking culture is different from European drinking culture. I&#x27;ve heard a number of people, mostly Americans complaining about our drinking culture, make claims like &quot;Germans drink, but they don&#x27;t get drunk&quot;.  We&#x27;re really not that different in general.  Some people drink very moderately.  Some people binge drink.  Some people binge drink to the point of serious danger.  Some people are alcoholics.<p>The biggest difference I see is that American culture is different with regards to youth drinking.  We&#x27;ve made it generally illegal to drink before the age of 21, so we have a culture of expected abstention until that age.  This means that youth drinking becomes <i>largely</i> binge drinking, because if you&#x27;re going to violate the law to consume alcohol, you&#x27;re probably going to do it to excess.  Contrarily, even if you were interested in moderation, you aren&#x27;t going to be moderately drinking often, because it&#x27;s not worth the risk.

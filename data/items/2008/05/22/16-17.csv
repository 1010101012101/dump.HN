197266,comment,197064,197090,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>a distinction between programming as art, and programming as plumbing [...] transcending the mundane to imagine the creative</i><p>I think this is a common misunderstanding of what art is. Every art has its mechanical, detailed side that must be worked through. The end result may be a lofty and soaring creation but it doesn't follow that the artist lofted and soared their way to get there. On the contrary, what's striking in the lives of great artists is not how they transcended the tough slog but how they did <i>more</i> of it, far more than their peers. The mundane and the creative are closely related, and the idea of the creative without the mundane is an ungrounded fantasy.<p>I remember reading something about the Beatles (by one of their early girlfriends or wives) that said when they went to parties, Lennon and McCartney would usually end up in a corner going over song ideas. There are countless such anecdotes. A woman walks up to Picasso in a restaurant and asks him to sketch whatever he likes on a napkin and charge her whatever he thinks it's worth. Picasso does so and says, ""That will be twenty thousand dollars."" ""But it only took you thirty seconds to do that!"" ""Madam, it took me thirty years to do that.""",1211474915

The keyboard is just amazing compared to anything else out there. The TrackPoint (little red mouse pointer thing in the keyboard) is great when you get used to it. Unless you play games, you should get the integrated graphics (great battery life and easier to get working under Linux). The only bad thing about ThinkPads is that they don't run Mac OS X (legally/easily).<p>If you are on a budget, I recommend getting a slightly older model (slower processor) but with as much memory as you can get. I also recommend that you get a model with the one-year warranty instead of the three-year warranty, to save money. There are so many people selling ThinkPad parts and accessories that there is no reason to pay for a warranty that you will probably never use when you can replace anything that breaks yourself for less money. I just priced one at lenovo.com and it was less than $1,100.<p>BTW, I strongly considered buying a MacBook but I went and tried them at the Apple store and I found that the keyboard is really horrible for programming.

Also big VCs might have some % of profit spent on charity just to give back to the society, for that you need to contact all big players. The best idea is to get couple of VCs/angels on your management team (or board) - they will raise more funds (just by making couple of phone calls) than you can ever get it by knocking doors for the whole year.<p>EDIT: the another idea is to put ""Donate"" button (asking users to donate by credit card) on almost all the web pages - more the people use your service the more the donation coming in. you may also raise some money by putting ads (text and display, related to your service) on the web pages, for example if you're providing online service related to health care then you can get advertisers from health industry (or if u want to keep it simple then use Google's and Yahoo's ad services).",1211473702

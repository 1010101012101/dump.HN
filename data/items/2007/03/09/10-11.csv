The comments on Mashable are worth checking out:<p>http://mashable.com/2007/03/08/myspace-news/<p>By their own contention, MySpace is a ""place for friends"". I am not sure what NewsCorp has in mind, but this is certainly not a direction that will appeal to teens. Companies that try to appeal to everyone end up losing market share to smaller more focused startups.",1173437946

You should fear having to go back to your cubicle job or the lecture hall at school. Know that a startup lifestyle is for you, and fear going back to the life you didn't want. Fear these and that will keep you reaching to succeed.",1173436881

3126,comment,3103,3103,0,0,danielha,,,"""In the world today, there's plenty of technology, plenty of entrepreneurs, plenty of money, plenty of venture capital. What's in short supply is great teams. Your biggest challenge will be building a great team. There's enormous change underway in every facet of the world. Some is technology driven, some is market driven. All that change creates unprecedented opportunity. But to take full advantage of those opportunities, focus on the team. Teams win.""<p>I'll refer future askers of ""Do I need a co-founder"" to that. They can get what they will from that.<p>I've been reading Jessica Livingston's Founders at Work and these interviews have pretty much reaffirmed that statement from Doerr. The perseverance and the great team relationships involved are what made some of these early startups. Without that, sometimes you're just a guy with a great idea.",1173435984

I have recently setup an article with an editor and 6 contributing authors; I know the collaboration on Google docs for such a project is going to be hell.<p>Octopart: I love vertical search engines since they have the potential to compete with mainstream search engines. Moreover, as an engineer and electronics enthusiast, I've always had trouble locating components, so Octopart will certainly come in handy. In fact, I am going to go ahead and recommend it to my EE friends.<p>Auctomatic: I am not a power user on eBay, but from the sound of it, this startup really has something going for them. There is a definite need for streamlining the process of listing on eBay. The downside is that their exit strategy is limited to eBay and perhaps a few other smaller companies.",1173435930

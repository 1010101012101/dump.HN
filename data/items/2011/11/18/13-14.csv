3251689,comment,3251522,3251522,1,0,dkersten,,,"Before I start my rant, let me say well done! I enjoyed the game and liked the deomonstration of fullscreen 3D browser games.<p>The game itself is pretty cool and demonstrates nicely the possibilities of browser-based gaming, though I get the impression that Javascript and WebGL aren't really going to displace native games anytime soon.<p>It runs at a very acceptable framerate of ~35 fps on my computer. This sounds good until you realise that I can run Skyrim on medium-to-high settings and get a similar (and sometimes higher) framerate. This game only uses 30 to 40% of my gpu, but the graphics are very simple. Skyrim uses 20 to 100% depending on the scene complexity, but even its simplest (20% cpu usage) scenes are more complex than this one. I've also tried lots of other WebGL demos and the common theme was usually low framerate but with low GPU usage, so my conclusion is that its not WebGL thats at fault , but Javascript - that is, the GPU renders what its given blazingly fast, and its the JS game logic and physics that caps the performance. I imagine most internet users won't have an expensive gaming graphics card like I do too, so my performance is probably even at the higher end of the spectrum, rather than representative...<p>I've played witht the ImpactJS game engine (not webgl, but 2d canvas drawing) and the performance analysis tool shows that rendering is always a tiny tiny portion of the frame time. Logic isn't all that much more (but I never had anything terribly complex either) and ""system overhead"" (stuff like garbage collection) was where most of the frames processing time was spent. I imagine that JS is also forced to give up cpu time more often than a native game would be - to keep the browser responsive.<p>tl;dr - cool game, but I don't believe Javascript performance is even close to really taking on native games. Yes, its improving, but it will be a few more years at best before its really good enough to make a difference.",1321624441

If they suspect a company is using unlicensed software from a member, they'll demand the company undergo a ""BSA audit"", which will work to correct the problem and reach a settlement. Of course, they aren't a law-enforcement organization, but they try to pressure companies to agree to a BSA audit through a mixture of claims that the company agreed to such an audit via their licensing terms, and through threats of lawsuits if they don't agree. There's a whole ""BSA audit defense/compliance"" specialist-lawyer industry around that.<p>To be fair, many of the companies targeted are not exactly innocent, but many businessmen who <i>do</i> have valid licenses are also worried about the expense/disruption of the process. Disorganized shops who don't have their licenses nicely indexed can end up in trouble, too, if they can't manage to rummage through enough cabinets to locate copies of their licenses (one reason some have resorted to physically attaching the Windows license to each machine, so it moves with it). It's sort of like being audited by the IRS; sucks even if you weren't cheating on your taxes, except it's weird that it can happen from someone who isn't even the government!<p>There were also some allegations (I believe settled out of court) in the 1990s that the BSA was using its enforcement threats to coerce companies into buying site licenses of its members, because having a site license would exempt you from the possibility of an audit.",1321623683

No Gmail app (very obviously) and the built-in email client doesn't seem to support Google's 2-factor auth. It doesn't accept your account password nor will it accept an app-specific password. The web interface works fine, but the icon you get with a www bookmark is generic and boring. I know that sounds like a nitpick, but a favorites tray full of generic-looking icons does not a good experience make.<p>2. Scrolling sucks. It sucks in every sense of the word. At no time does scrolling through a web page, an app, or even the UI begin immediately and smoothly. And if that weren't bad enough, turning pages in Kindle books is equally frustrating. This is supposed to be the primary purpose for which the device is designed, and pages turn slowly and jerky, never glued to your fingertip. It makes the entire experience seem to lag behind your every move, and constantly waiting for the device to catch up to where you were a second ago gets annoying very fast.<p>Beyond that, every little thing seemed disappointing in some way.<p>My wife was hopeful that this would be an affordable alternative to a Galaxy Tab.

When will internet explainers ever get this right? :-) Your explanation cannot be literally correct because, if the null hypothesis is true (the coin is fair), the ""probability of seeing the data"" is exactly the same for all possible sequences of six coinflips. What hypothesis testing actually does is arbitrarily pick a class of data that's ""at least as extreme"" as what was actually seen, and report its total probability.<p>To quote Eliezer Yudkowsky rephrasing Steven Goodman's example:<p>> <i>So lo and behold, I flip the coin six times, and I get the result TTTTTH.  Is this result statistically significant, and if so, what is the p-value - that is, the probability of obtaining a result at least this extreme? Well, that depends.  Was I planning to flip the coin six times, and count the number of tails?  Or was I planning to flip the coin until it came up heads, and count the number of trials?  In the first case, the probability of getting ""five tails or more"" from a fair coin is 11%, while in the second case, the probability of a fair coin requiring ""at least five tails before seeing one heads"" is 3%.</i><p>Also see the ""voltmeter story"": <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_principle#The_voltmeter_story"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_principle#The_voltme...</a> .",1321623187

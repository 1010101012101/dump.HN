Both are very common and hardly unique.

We found out a few months later, that there was a hungarian company that had the same name, same concept for logo (which was typography only), very similar font and almost identical color scheme. It can happen. In our case you could blame us for not researching it, but similarities hardly mean stealing, especially if there are no really unique attributes...<p>edit: corrected syntax, formatting",1425556679

9150174,comment,9147561,9149886,0,0,adventured,,,"The short explanation is: earnings are what matter. Valuations are almost entirely derived from future earnings and growth potential or expectations.<p>Using cash to buy earnings is often a very expensive maneuver, you inevitably end up paying rich premiums to acquire those earnings streams. Most big acquisitions are disasters. It&#x27;s very hard to take $XX billion in cash, and buy somethings that will actually translate to an appropriate earnings stream for the next ten years such that it can even pay for itself.<p>Assets like the Alibaba stake often have tax consequences associated with them, such that you&#x27;re never going to see the full cash value of the assets no matter what happens (if I&#x27;m not mistaken, Yahoo has already paid billions in taxes on previously sold off shares of Alibaba).<p>Companies with large cash balances, that typically tells you they don&#x27;t require that cash to fuel growth. At that point the value of that cash to the growth of the business plunges. Something that isn&#x27;t very important to growth, will be discounted heavily by investors.<p>A few examples.<p>Let&#x27;s say you have equipment on your balance sheet. For example some small energy companies have a very large % of their assets held in equipment. If the company ever gets into trouble, such that that equipment really needs to be converted into cash (eg to pay debt coming due), you&#x27;re going to get a fraction of the supposed value in a sale. The company will get squeezed. In almost any scenario where those equipment assets come into play, they&#x27;re going to get knocked down in value.<p>Let&#x27;s say you own real estate, a building for your headquarters. Unless you&#x27;re sitting on really valuable land, or in a booming economic zone, more often than not you&#x27;re going to take a beating on the resale value of those assets. The acquirer will probably have to do a lot of renovations, or perhaps entirely demolish your existing building; there is also likely to be plenty of other competing commercial buildings available. This is a typical problem faced by fading companies that purchase a trophy headquarters during the good years.<p>When it comes to cash (if you&#x27;re valuing a publicly traded corporation this is even more frequently the case), the company is primarily valued based on its future earnings potential, cash flow, growth rate, margins, market position and sometimes intangibles such as brand (eg Coke) or patents: things that are primarily responsible for the performance of the business toward generating earnings and growth.<p>Most successful companies don&#x27;t have a cash problem, they have a need for growth, and you can&#x27;t just buy growth with cash (that&#x27;s a fast way to vaporize very large sums of cash however). The market doesn&#x27;t care if Apple has an extra $20 billion in cash on its balance sheet: the market wants to see Apple boost earnings by 20%.<p>The market will excuse all sorts of balance sheet disasters, so long as the net income is there, the cash flow is there, there&#x27;s some growth, and the business is sound.<p>For example, Comcast, Time Warner, AT&T have notoriously terrible balance sheets. It doesn&#x27;t meaningfully subtract from the the valuation placed on the business. Time Warner Cable has negative $21 billion in net tangible assets. They&#x27;ve been worth $35 to $45 billion in terms of market value for the last several years, giving them a 17 to 22 or so PE ratio - they&#x27;re suffering no obvious $20 billion discount against their valuation due to the horrible balance sheet (they trade with a multiple comparable to their peers). Why? Because the market doesn&#x27;t care, so long as their debt is manageable and the earnings are there.<p>Apple could discharge $100 billion in cash off to investors tomorrow morning, their stock would not drop by 15% to match that reduction in cash. Why not? Because Apple is primarily being valued based on its earnings, and expectations of continued iPhone growth generating ever greater profit levels.<p>Cisco for example has $53b in cash, and its market cap is $150b. If they discharged $40 billion of that tomorrow in a one-time dividend, the market would cheer, rather than crash the stock by 25%. Cisco has a 17 pe ratio, and its valuation is supported by its consistent earnings, not the cash.<p>That cash for Cisco has value to the extent it can be useful to provide more growth. Put one way: only a % of that cash is ever going to actually deliver growth, which is what investors really want. Investors would love to see Cisco be able to invest $10b in cash, and yield $50b in new earnings, but that simply isn&#x27;t going to happen. What&#x27;s going to happen, is that cash is going to sit there and yield terrible interest, and occasionally be used for a couple billion dollar acquisition. It has low real value, in the sense that whether Cisco has $15b in cash or $50b in cash, makes almost no difference to their earnings potential over the next ~5 years.<p>For Yahoo, $20+ billion in cash isn&#x27;t likely to buy them a big fat profit stream worth $1+ billion per year, and the market knows it. Expectations for what that cash will do for the Yahoo business, are very low. Yahoo&#x27;s core has problems, and cash isn&#x27;t going to solve them. If the market believed Yahoo could take $20 billion and translate it into a new earnings stream worth $3 billion per year (eg $60 billion in new market value), the market would of course go crazy and bid Yahoo up.<p>And last but not least, the easiest way to prove all of this out is this: if Yahoo is doing $4 billion in sales, $500 million in earnings, and they discharge all of their Alibaba + Yahoo Japan holdings to shareholders, the theory would have to be that that $4 billion in sales and $500 million in earnings is worth a negative valuation for a public company. Now, it goes without saying that that is an extraordinarily dumb conclusion, that no person would reach in valuing a public company. If Yahoo simply did not possess any of those assets, nobody would look at their business, as a public company, and slap a negative $7 billion valuation on it. The fact that writers keep repeating that premise, well, I don&#x27;t know what to say about it at this point.",1425556543

9150165,comment,9149038,9149705,0,0,mjburgess,,,"The problem is we&#x27;re dealing with real objects, conflating real objects and mathematical objects is begging the question against the person saying we need haecceity (also called &quot;thisness&quot; - the property of being &quot;this&quot; thing and not &quot;that&quot; thing).<p>If real objects are just like mathematical objects then all they are is bundles of properties: object A is no more than the set of properties that can be ascribed to A.<p>There are a few problems with that, but here&#x27;s an interesting one. Consider a world in which there are only two identical iron spheres, say 1 mile wide, 1 mile apart from each other. Now each sphere has exactly the same properties - are they the same spheres?<p>Most people would say no. So what individuates them? Well, some property that makes it the case that one sphere is that sphere and not any other.<p>To put it in your terminology, for every boolean function f(x) which is true iff x has property f and false if it doesn&#x27;t have f (eg. IsIron(x) = True), then both spheres have exactly the same set of true/false values for all properties (forall f.). <i>Unless</i> we introduce a haeecity functions: a(x = A) = True  for A, b(x = B) = True for B - ie. properties which are only true when their arguments pick out the objects which they are about.

The simple case is one where I use foldMap to put together some values in a list. In isolation it&#x27;s only saving a few lines compared to an explicit summing loop - but if you can &quot;replace a few lines with a single method call&quot; in a lot of places in your code, you end up with much more readable/maintainable code.<p>The other is more complex but also shows the power a bit more: a report that wants to accumulate some statistics separately (something like &quot;12 successful, 45 error A, 2 error B&quot;). So I have a type representing that:<p><pre><code>    case class Stats(successful: Int, errorA: Int, errorB: Int)
</code></pre>
I use <a href=""https://github.com/typelevel/shapeless-contrib"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/typelevel/shapeless-contrib</a> to automatically derive a Monoid instance for this type.<p>And then I can use this type with the Writer monad: <a href=""http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/Writer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/Writer.html</a><p>So with very little code, my report steps all include a &quot;stats for this step&quot;, and they automatically accumulate into an overall stats object. Of course this is nothing I couldn&#x27;t have written myself, but the library methods already exist and help.<p>More importantly though, I have another report that uses the same infrastructure, but makes async HTTP calls. So that report uses Future. But I can share common code between the two reports easily, because my abstract superclass is just `Report[F[_]: Monad]`.<p>I think they are happening, slowly but surely. Five years ago I wouldn&#x27;t have dared suggest explicitly using Monad in production code. Two years ago we used one single Monad across our whole application, and even that was controversial.

I guess my question is --- &#x27;Who doesn&#x27;t have voices?&#x27; and what&#x27;s wrong with them?<p>Do they interfere with your day to day living? Do they cause you distress? Do they ever tell you to harm yourself or other people?<p>There&#x27;s a few possibilities.<p>People with an OCD can experience very distressing, intrusive thoughts. There are no reported instances of someone with an OCD acting on those thoughts. The risk to other people or the person comes from the protective measures the person takes.  Someone who has a germophobia may restrict themselves from day to day life and wash their hands frequently with bleach. A mother with post-natal OCD may have thoughts like &quot;just throw baby out of the window&quot;. She will reduce contact with her child to protect the child. But no woman has ever acted on the thoughts of an OCD; no mother with OCD has ever thrown their child out of a window.<p>People with an OCD recognise their thoughts as thougts.<p>People with a psychosis style illness may hear voices - have auditory hallucinations.  Violence as a result of a psychosis style illness is rare, but possible. A person hearing non-distressing voices may want to learn how to contact mental health services just in case the voices turn distressing. A person experiencing distressing voices should probably contact mental health services.<p>EliRiver and ripter describe nicely the difference between thoughts and voices.<p>There are a few things that can cause auditory hallucinations and not all of them are mental illness.",1425553905

Read Larry Lessig&#x27;s book about the outsized threat of campaign contributions beyond the actual contribution budget. Or, read about the Panopticon prison model or behavioral studies of the psychology of loss avoidance.<p>There are all kinds of peaceful forums that have this problem and Metafilter is just a prominent example. The thread you linked is interesting but not outstanding for a web forum, and the cost of it is probably several threads that a healthier community would have made.<p>This is hard for you to see because you probably read about new people entering these communities and praising them for closely fitting their preferences. What you don&#x27;t see is how many people leave, don&#x27;t join or reduce participation.<p>But again, these are common forum issues. The owner of Metafilter has managed the situation pretty well and especially over sixteen years. I&#x27;m sure the personal attention to the community by Metafilter staff is a big reason why it&#x27;s as similar to its old self as it is.",1425553429

Pin in this context means you have the identity of the specific certificate stored on your client, and so you are not depending on whether or not it is being declared by some CA to be be valid for the server in question. Instead you are expecting <i>that exact certificate</i>.<p>That it is a private cert does not make it any more secure, but pinning is more secure, and with a pinned cert, having the cert signed by a CA gives no <i>additional</i> security.",1425553385

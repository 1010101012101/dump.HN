6235533,comment,6234612,6234969,2,0,e12e,,,"I think* that for those of us that don&#x27;t have any language learning disability, or &quot;glyph&quot; learning disability -- all symbolic communication is best understood as flow of words/phrases, not symbols -- at least when you&#x27;re talking about fluency/proficiency/literacy. I believe that&#x27;s simply how our brains work.<p>Yes, spoken language is technically built out of phonemes (sounds that we can distinguish, and which carry meaning) -- but there aren&#x27;t &quot;universal&quot; phonemes (hence most Japanese&#x27;s problems distinguishing between r/l -- two sounds that are almost identical, and do not carry distinct meaning in Japanese, but do in most(?) European languages).<p>But the &quot;stops&quot; that allows us to &quot;hear&quot; the phonemes, and even the &quot;stops&quot; between words -- are in fact almost non-existent. This is one reason why we often feel native speakers of a language we&#x27;ve yet to master, speak &quot;too quickly&quot;. Our brains are unable to recognize the patterns (words and phrases) from the stream of sounds.<p>I thnik there&#x27;s a storng parallel there to how we raed word-picurtes, and not wrods. (Read that line again, slowly).<p>It makes sense to me that to be &quot;literate&quot; in morse, you&#x27;d have to stop looking at the letters, and start looking for the words. Sounds like a great way to learn morse code (and there might be a lesson there about flashcards for foreign languages as well...).",1376884703

If two are a struggle, five is cruelty&quot;.<p>Seriously, if you&#x27;re planing on using the pumping lemma you should also be able to read and understand those five quantifiers. It&#x27;s not &quot;just the lemma&quot;, it&#x27;s also the ability to read that and understand it that has some value in itself. Go on then to the pumping lemma for context free languages. I don&#x27;t know about you but learning how to read the lemma and understand it, helped me understand the lemma for CFG really quickly.<p>Knowledge is always good, and if you have to learn something else to get the lemma too, then that&#x27;s even better and what do you know maybe one day you&#x27;ll have to know how to read a complex statement with quantifiers and not the pumping lemma.",1376884674

And they were no more willing to start nuclear war than Americans were.  And given the fact that there was completely Mutually Assured Destruction, there was no point for the Soviet Union to ever launch a nuclear strike.<p>So, sure, there was always the <i>possibility</i> of nuclear war, just like there is currently the possibility of a nuclear war against China, or India, Pakistan, North Korea, etc.  But it&#x27;s not nearly as likely as we were brainwashed to believe as kids.<p>Instead, Reagan used this as a tool to increase support for a build-up of nuclear weapons, to increase military spending, and ultimately turned the US from the world&#x27;s largest creditor to the world&#x27;s largest debtor.  Some might say that he saved the world from the Soviet Union by crippling them financially by goading them into an arms race that they couldn&#x27;t win financially.

The quality of this FAQ entry is in my opinion narrowed by their inclusion of FileNotFoundException, which it seems they did not understand. The use case for this exception is <i>not</i> to allow lazy programmers to use it instead of checking that a file exists, but to signal to a programmer that his world view of the state of his program may be <i>wrong</i> despite his best efforts, e.g.<p><pre><code>  if(file.exists())\n  {\n    //do something\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s a race condition between the if and do something which invalidates the programmers world view (someone can delete the file between these two statements). And this is an exceptional situation the program has to deal with. Error codes <i>may</i> tell the programmer this, but it is quite likely that the programmer will just ignore it, because &quot;I&#x27;ve already checked that it exists - what could possibly go wrong?&quot;. Exceptions, especially checked exceptions (in my opinion the only good exceptions for &quot;normal&quot; program code)(1), force the programmer to deal with this problem. Or to say - deliberately - &quot;Hey, program, I don&#x27;t care for the stability of my software.

That they <i>are</i> now being solved by Go is likely an effect of the &quot;Golang advocacy group&quot; that has formed at Google.<p>Others can&#x27;t be solved by Erlang, but can be solved by Go (e.g. CPU-bound matrix-multiplications for PageRank index calculation), or vice-versa (e.g. deploying new Google Talk daemon code without dropping the XMPP connection.)<p>I&#x27;m not saying Google could have used Erlang for <i>everything</i>.

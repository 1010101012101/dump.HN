Some ads are aimed at them to make the whole &quot;experience&quot; somehow better, to offset buyer&#x27;s remorse.  That way you will talk up your purchase and be more likely to buy another when you replace it.<p>The other is when you have a high volume low-price item (e.g. toothpaste): you&#x27;ve demonstrated a willingness to buy (i.e. you&#x27;re a qualified buyer at some level) so why not try to remind you that the next time you need toothpaste you should get it from the same place?<p>Since so much marketing &quot;science&quot; is bull, nobody actually knows if this works (any more than they do with the online ads).

7927803,comment,7927640,7927640,22,0,hawkharris,,,"This reminds me of a fascinating article in The New Yorker called &quot;Twilight of the Brands.&quot; [0] The author&#x27;s basic argument is that brands have historically filled an information gap. Before the Internet, when consumers didn&#x27;t have tons of on-demand info about products, brands were a compass that pointed them in the right direction. If the last Sylvania TV you bought worked well, you might buy another one without hunting down reviews for the new model.<p>Now that product info is ubiquitous, the author says, the role of brands and traditional advertising is declining. So, when I hear critiques about a particular form of online advertising, I think about the broader, more subtle ways in which websites influence our purchases. Companies are starting to pay more attention to online forums and social sites, which are more persuasive to consumers than traditional banner ads.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2014/02/17/140217ta_talk_surowiecki"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2014/02/17/140217ta_...</a>",1403444788

I also felt that way, spent the first month after leaving looking for next closest thing.<p>The most exciting thing I found was Nix <<a href=""https://nixos.org/nix/>"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nixos.org/nix/></a>, a hermetic build system + linux distro + config-based service manager, all built around a purely functional language.<p>The way it&#x27;s actually used to build a lot of existing projects is coarse-grained — the Nix build actions might be simply &quot;get tarball; untar; configure; make&quot;.  (I think it may be combined with distcc/ccache for per-object caching, not sure).<p>But if they run existing tool to do the actual builds, how do they enforce hermetic dependencies?  They force a specific absolute path structure where all inputs and outputs dirs include the (transitive) hashes.\n[There is also some crazy rewriting of hashes inside binaries, which they claim works fine.]<p>The drawback is <i></i>you can&#x27;t move binaries or libs around<i></i>; the benefit is multiple versions can coexist in-place.<p>I was planning to experiment with some pieces I was missing:\n - Use bup <<a href=""https://github.com/bup/bup>"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bup/bup></a> to chunk build products for incremental transmission of similar builds.\n - Their build farm IIUC assumes long-running slaves; I wanted to build on public cloud only paying for burst activity.<p>Then I suddenly remembered that I write python and now javascript, which I can use without any kind of build, and gave it up :-)<p>But if I were to toy with hermetic building now, I&#x27;d look at basing it on Docker.",1403442302

The gyms themselves select insurance-friendly machinery.<p>While Crossfit gets people up off their backsides to do actual work, there's a lot of flat out stupidity mixed in with the legit stuff.<p>High rep Oly movements?

That is still being racist, because you are discriminating applicants success based on ethnicity.<p>Reactive laws is really just judicial.  You can't write a fire and forget rule of law and have it be anything but a passive manipulator of public policy, it doesn't have reactionary change based on circumstances like courts do.<p>> Also, use of the legal system to remedy institutional and societal problems has really only been effective to introduce marginal change in the face of existing problems, so its not an overall solution to the problem, just a small part.<p>You don't solve the hostile behaviors of cultures and groups by being racist.  You solve it by criminalizing their racism and punishing those who are bigoted.<p>> This would of course assume that it is possible to be institutionally racist against the predominant white culture in the US, which is not possible. In that sense, a policy such as affirmative action is not racist and instead is a policy that combats racism.<p>I'd argue the MLB is institutionally racist against white people.  There is a tremendous cultural racism thinking it requires high melanin skin content (not even necessarily African heritage) to be good in basketball.  And <i>that</i> is a permeating cultural force that a lot of people don't argue against, they just ""assume black people are better at basketball"".  Or how Asians are better at math because they are Asian, and not because they had strict parents who lauded over their studies.<p>There is plenty of institutional anti-white racism.  White people can't be ""street"" or ideas like ""white people can't dance"".  They are institutional, not of white culture, but other cultures.  It doesn't mean it isn't racist if the majority population isn't in the culture that purports it.<p>I'm not saying there isn't tremendous institutional racism and sexism in the US.  I'm just saying inverse bigotry that replaces merit with skin color, ethnicity, or gender is inherently wrong.  When ethnic minorities and women experience less math, science, and intellectual learning, you go where they aren't getting that and give it to them, you don't take what is inherently not racial and make it so.",1352448363

4761846,comment,4759642,4761118,2,0,pandaman,,,"The entrance math exam in MSU is not pass/fail but graded. There are two math exams (at least in the ""math department"", I imagine she meant either Mech-Mat or VMK), written and oral. Written exam consists of 6 problems with the passing mark 3 and maximum 5 (you only need to solve 5 correctly, 5th and 6th problems are the hardest and usually allow a choice between an algebra and a geometry problem, giving the time limit it's hard to solve both). Oral test is administered by drawing a random ""ticket"" with two general questions from the school program (e.g. ""What are properties of a triangle?"") and the problems the person conducting the test can choose based on the answers and the result of the written test. Answering two ""ticket"" questions correctly gives you the passing grade (3) already. So there is no way anybody could be failed by any number of the problems given during the oral test if they managed to answer the ""ticket"". At the worst case one could be dropped to 3 at the oral test, giving total of 8 for the both math tests and that's a pretty good mark. Total test score of 13 (you need to get 5 for the third marked test, written Physics and pass unmarked written Russian) is guaranteed admission. 12 - is a good chance of admission and, depending on the year, even 11 can get you in.<p>However there is a shortcut - under some conditions (either being a subject of one of Soviet ""AA"" incentives or being a winner of a math Olympiad), 4 or 5 for the first test (written math) gives automatic admission. 9 for the both math tests is also automatic and unconditional admission.<p>So the way the hard questions in the oral test come up is usually when you get 4 for the written test. If you could not solve 5th or 6th problem in the written test you are at the average level and giving you 5 (and automatically admitting you) in the oral test would defeat the whole purpose of the shortcut rule to secure admission for the exceptional students. So you have to get 4 or, really, 3 and such a question is to ensure that.<p>I don't know about anti-semitism, maybe there was some yet I have seen plenty of Jews both among students and faculty so, evidentially, they have not been entirely kept out.

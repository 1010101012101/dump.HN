2383859,comment,2383502,2383502,14,0,michaelochurch,,,"Not the ""right"" answer, but the rude as fuck and honest answer that I'd give:<p><i>It's Friday, a feature you're working on is due on Monday and all you have is some spaghetti code and that academic paper you don't understand. What do you do?</i><p>First, if the writer of the spaghetti code is still with the company, I go over and ask him (politely; maybe this was <i>his</i> deadline code) to explain why he wrote his code in such a way. (Maybe there's a good reason for it and the problem isn't bad code but a lack of understanding on my end.) I let him know that I'm going to have to spend an entire weekend on a critical feature and ask him to make himself available, if not work with me, while we figure this out. Involving him will radically improve my chances of success at meeting the deadline.<p>I've had enough experience to know that even with great people making solid efforts, most deadlines slip. It's not like school where deadlines are exceedingly well-tested and failing one is usually a reflection on the student, not the situation. Just out of professional responsibility, I have to let my boss know that I may not be able to succeed by Monday.<p>I may not do it, but it's my job to work as hard as I can. That said, the most important thing is bringing in the developer who wrote the original ""spaghetti code"". Working alone, it's more likely than not that, even with great effort, I'll fail it: new features are always more complicated than they look. If I can involve the writer of the ""spaghetti code"" in my weekend rush, that's a huge benefit and I just might make it.<p>It's possible that the writer of the code is gone. This is scarier. If the guy was fired, then I congratulate the trigger-puller on her good sense, but I ask why we're still using terrible code of someone who was fired. If it'll take me less than 6 hours to replace it, I do. I'll make that time up over the weekend because dealing with shitty code is exhausting and infuriating and will cost me more than that.<p>If the code is so terrible, I tell the manager that this code really needs to be replaced and that it is a very high priority because it's necessary for a critical feature and an unmaintainable mess. If I get the feeling that she doesn't care about source quality, I GTFO of the company.<p>In terms of how I manage my own time, I work till 10 on Friday night, get a good night's sleep, work out at 7 and start working at 8. The morning (8 - 12) I spend reading the paper and the code (when I'm sharpest, because reading code is harder than writing) and the afternoon (2 - 10) I spend writing. No all-nighter on Friday or Saturday because that's fucking stupid-- you pay for it the next day, and productivity in a double-all-nighter is negative. All-nighter on Sunday if needed. Take Monday off, except possibly to verify that the feature worked, if I work past 10:00pm on Sunday.<p>If we're established enough that ""vacation days"" exist in a limited allotment and bad things happen to you if you take more, I better get 2 vacation days for the weekend I worked or I am fucking quitting. I don't mind working weekends but I won't be taken advantage of.<p>I also mandate that I'll be allowed to spend Tuesday and Wednesday cleaning up <i>my</i> shitty code that I produced to meet the deadline. I'm very good, but my deadline code stinks as much as anyone else's.<p>Finally, I ask why the feature was ""due"" on Monday. Who made this promise, and why? Can we stop making unrealistic promises to clients and focus on delivering what we understand, well? Weekend heroics are occasionally necessary, but if they become a common occurrence and management starts requiring or relying on them, that's a bad sign. There are a lot of companies (some startups, some not) that exist to take advantage of dumb young people who don't know their rights but I am 27 and far too old for that shit.<p>Maybe I make the deadline and maybe I don't. Maybe I even get fired when I tell the management not to make unrealistic promises to clients anymore. Most often it's unintentional when things like this happen, but there is a really fucking parasitic (I don't put it this way; I'm not <i>that</i> rude) anti-pattern you sometimes see where client-relations guy makes unrealistic promises and becomes a star while inflicting suffering (impossible deadlines, perpetual crunch) on technical people. You know how unskilled programmers always inline because ""it makes the code go faster""? Unskilled managers always create ""crunch"" or ""urgent"" conditions because ""it makes people work harder"". Client-facing people who make unrealistic promises are the enablers of those shitty managers.<p>If that particular anti-pattern is in place: in a startup, I leave if I can't get the CR guy out because he'll bleed talent and the startup has no future because its clients don't respect it. In a mid-size company, I try to get the parasite plucked out-- but am most likely to fail; the fact that he's in client relations means he has better social skills than I do. Still, it's always worth a try to make a company better, no?<p>""He's single"" but I'm guessing half of my readers can see why. New York based.",1301424301

I've found clients are much willing to pay more when they trust the consultant and a verbal referral from a friend can go a long way in providing that trust.<p>Some tips for this:<p>* Make sure your friends know what you do - update your Facebook profile, hand out business cards, start a blog, etc.<p>* Make sure your friends think/know that you are the best developer that they know and that you are the first person they think of when someone says ""I'm going to need a website""<p>* Use LinkedIn - surprisingly enough, I've had old contacts connect with me via LinkedIn, view my profile and hire me for a project<p>* Exploit whatever niche you're a part of - if you are active in your church, approach them or another local church to see if they need a site.  Apply same strategy for a youth group, social club, etc.",1301424165

As a small company you simply cant have both. Enterprise clients need things done exactly how they need them done. Small clients dont want to pay for features they dont need.<p>3) marketing generates leads - you may not have a sales problem it may be a marketing problem. Do you go to shows? Mailing list? advertising? etc You have a sales problem if you are not able to convert leads to sales.<p>4) I sell exclusively to fortune 1000 clients and I can tell you they are a pain in the ass and will suck your morale dry.

The elephants are great because they can dependably generate > 2M in business for us each year, but they will steal your soul.<p>5) 80% of your revenue in a single client is probably the single biggest risk you have.

You may want it to be that the code is bad, but if that really isnt the issue, then fixing the code wont get you more revenue. I think it is probably a lack of understanding of who your customer really is and what they need. Once you decide, then you can implement specific changes to make it happen. Those changes most likely will include determining how to reach those people then running campaigns to reach them. Once you reach them you can find out why they arent buying, then you can begin making changes to the code.",1301422785

I found that since I make websites myself, I tend to value the work a lot less because it seems easier to me.  In reality, the work is very valuable to people who are not capable of doing it themselves, so they're usually willing to pay more for it than you are.  And as usual patio11 is spot on in regards to those qualities, having strength in those areas can give you a powerful edge in winning over clients.",1301422080

2383687,comment,2382279,2382279,4,0,lefstathiou,,,"I view this as a disturbing assault on individual liberty and freedom. Automobiles and the mobility they offer communities have played a monumentally positive role in the shaping of modern society. In many ways they serve as a form of checks and balances. With automobiles, we can put our kids in better schools, even if they are further away, we can learn about different communities that offer benefits relative to our own (for example lower taxation, more open-minded, etc) and move to them. They give us the ability to fulfill the innate human desire to explore. You may think this is silly but i know with 100% certainty i am far less inclined to take a road trip to new places if it entails connecting on 4 different forms of public transportation. I own a car in the city now, but if i'm not allowed to drive it, where do i put it?<p>The reality of how this will play out is that it will only further increase the perceived and actual separation of wealth with no descernable improvement in environmental conditions. Property prices are going to sky-rocket since this is essentially government mandated urbanization. Poor people are going to have to live further, commute longer and now wont have access to simple ""luxuries"". Their employment options will be more limited as will their leisurly activity. Owning a second home, something many people in europe do, becomes that much more difficult. All because the government wants to control how you get to from point A to B.<p>I hope they fail.",1301421947

He responded with the typical ""I couldn't in good conscience charge that for something that takes me only a few hours to do!"" And then we had a long discussion about how the market sets the rate, not you, and if you hold your rate under market it will overwhelm you because you're leaving money on the table, if you don't have enough work to keep you busy then you're over market. The key here is <i>the market sets the rate, you don't</i>.<p>Once we established that it was pretty easy to see how letting his rate float up would help with his workload, he would not only be less overloaded but he would be collecting more of the market value of his work. Since in his case (he's nominally retired) not working at all was just fine, he had a lot of freedom in over shooting the market and then coming back.<p>I recognize that its not as useful for someone who is wondering where rent money will come from.",1301421936

It is a shakedown scheme, pure and simple.  Due process is abused to such an absurd extent.  Never mind the strain these lawsuits are putting on ISP's for ip lookups, -so much so that multiple ISP have come out and sided against these frivolous lawsuits.<p>All that being said, the issue here is not what the right decision is, but rather how Howel a former RIAA lobbyist and lawmaker could possibly make an unbiased decision.<p>Frankly, regardless of your stance on the p2p subject, her even being appointed to such a position leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth.  If I were in her shoes, I would recognize the ethical dilemma and sit that one out.  But to add insult to injury she has chosen to ignore the hand full of precedents set by multiple judges around the country to disallow such abuses inherent in these mass joint filings.<p>Ironically, numerous people have argues that her past knowledge of law would make her a better judge.  So she knows the laws, many of which she helped write; when and where did she learn a damn thing about technology, -I don't know like the fact these law firms are paying for cheap inaccurate methods for infringement detection so they can pad their lawsuits with still more innocent person to shake down.

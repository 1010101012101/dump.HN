They offer up two examples, but the ""examples"" don't resemble anything that I can play with or take action with, I see two code snippets and not much in the way of explanation.<p>I find enough APIs like this that I have a text file with sample api calls for different services that I get out when I go to play around with them as I can't find cut-and-paste examples of their calls in their documentation.<p>If anyone can steer me to a URL I can try out (I have an api key), I'd be appreciative.

619568,comment,618804,619442,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I was under the impression that this was more like ExtJS (i.e. the heavier end of the scale) rather than something like jQuery that pretty much just works on top of standard HTML markup.<p>I spent several months attempting to hack our applications to work within the ExtJS way, but found it pretty hostile to working with a traditional web application (e.g. POST/GET rather than AJAX everything).  This bad experience led me to dismiss Cappuccino as being inappropriate for our needs, though it might be useful for writing apps from scratch.  jQuery has proven far more amenable to a baby-steps conversion from a traditional CGI app to an AJAX application.  There's also the accessibility and downgrade path question with all-JavaScript generated pages (like ExtJS, and, I thought, Cappuccino).<p>But perhaps I'm mistaken about Cappuccino.",1242863882

After a certain size, it doesn't matter really how big the community is because there is enough to sustain help.  After a certain point, it only helps in finding specialized sub-communities which need to be that minimum size too.  I think almost any language that a person here would consider for some project or another has that community, and you'll really notice the difference w/ languages that don't.

Go find a poor person. Use your money to make them less poor. It's easy, really. If the nation can do it, surely you or I could do it as well, right?<p>The goal of this experiment is to take away lofty ideals and ask practical questions: just what are we supposed to do that is going to help? Just what really helps and does not hurt poor people?<p>So pick a strategy and pay for it. Let's agree to come back in three years and see how they are doing.<p>You'll find that there are only three cases: 1) the person is poor because they continue to make poor choices, perhaps due to addiction, mental capacity, or emotional issues, 2) the person is temporarily poor due to circumstances outside of their control and is quite able to get ahead in the world if given time and left alone, 3) the person is somehow trapped by circumstances outside of their control which will not go away: medical bills, bad spouse, etc.<p>#1 and #3 aren't going anywhere -- by definition they have chronic issues which money will not fix. No amount of mental therapy is going to make a drug addict into a banker: recidivism for drug addiction is around 95%. No amount of money is going to take the wife of a crack addict wife-beater and turn her family into Oprah's.<p>For #2, those guys are going to do well anyway. Sure, if you want to lend a helping hand to make yourself feel better, go for it. But don't kid yourself that you're the one making the difference. The difference comes from inside, not from outside.<p>I'm not saying don't help people. I'm saying that lofty, praiseworthy feel-good rhetoric does not fix a damn thing. Instead everybody just smiles and nods and agrees to spend money. If you or I have a hell of a time fixing one poor person, with direct one-on-one involvement, it is completely ludicrous to expect an impersonal government to do it for us. It's also a lazy man's morality -- I'd like to help people today, but I'd rather write a check (or even better, make the rich guy down the street write a huge check) and just go take care of it, okay?",1242863141

619545,comment,619512,619512,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Used, obviously.<p>But you should buy from an individual rather than a dealer.  You pay a very large markup from a dealer on used cars, and most have a vested interest in keeping the price of used cars as high as possible (because they want to sell you a new car even more than a used car).  The dealer also knows better than you when they have a good used car...it's been through their shop, so they know.  If it's a ""good deal"" at a car dealer, then you're almost certainly getting a car that's going to have problems in the future.<p>Also note that standalone used car dealers are often merely dumping grounds for the cars that new car dealers don't consider worth putting on their lot.  So, even though a dealer that only deals in used cars wants to sell you a used car and has no interest in you buying a new car, he also generally only has steady access to the cars that new car dealers take on trade-in but don't want to sell on the lot.  (There are also bankruptcy and repossession auctions, auctions of distressed vehicles from out of state that are auctioned as scrap and then re-titled as clean through various loopholes in the law, and a <i>few</i> trade-ins from people buying a used car from that dealer and upgrading.  But used car dealers are almost universally selling the absolute worst cars available, and at significant markup.)<p>Buying from an honest individual, knowing the blue book price, and having a trusted mechanic go over the car before making a decision, is the best way to insure you get a good deal on a good car.  Watch for signs that you're dealing with a hobbyist used car salesman.  There are many folks that operate small-scale buy-sell operations from their home, having one or two cars for sale at any given time, mostly purchased through the same shady channels as used car dealers.<p>There are probably exceptions to the always buy used rule.  Finding a used sports car that is actually going to last is difficult.  Most folks don't know how to care for a performance car, and will drive the hell out of it for a year or two, and then pass it on when it starts getting troublesome.  BMWs fall into this category a lot of times.  When I bought a 350Z a few years back, I bought new, because the few used ones I could find were already (just a year after they hit the market) pretty abused and had problems.<p>But I'm not even certain that was a wise choice...if I'd waited another year, I might have found more options to buy used.  Regardless, the vast majority of cars don't fall into this category, and the more boring the car, the better deal you can get on it used.  My folks bought a two or three year old Camry with 30k miles for very little, like maybe eight grand, a few years back.",1242862998

($4K seemed like such a good deal at the time!, its was a beautiful car with 160K) After another $4K in repairs and a blown headgasket...not such a good deal after all...<p>What's the most economical replacement car? 
A) Brand new Japanese car which I'll take great care of for the next 20 years.
B) The same car for a few thousand less with a few thousand miles on it.
C) Similar car for dirt cheap with a whole lot of miles on it?<p>I'm not concerned about style or comfort, just trying to figure out what's the best deal economically.",1242861869

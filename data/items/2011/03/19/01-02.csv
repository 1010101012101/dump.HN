Allowing people to work more creatively is great for society, but it's bad for the people who currently hold power (who care more about their relative position in society than the health of society as a whole). I don't see a non-confrontational solution.<p>I'm half socialist. I actually think the best way out is to provide a substantial basic income. Emphasis on <i>basic</i>, not minimum, income. The difference is that MI means the government makes up the difference for low earners, whereas BI is an amount (of cash and services, such as healthcare and education) that everyone-- rich, poor, or middle-class-- gets. Then there's no ""welfare valley"" where a person becomes poorer by getting a job; one's income is a monotonically increasing function, as it should be, of what one earns. I think the BI should be about 50% of society's income, financed through flat taxation, a small wealth tax at the upper end, and very high (90+ at top) inheritance taxes. The other 50% is distributed by a free market. This actually makes most middle-class peoples' net tax (remember that they get the BI as well) <i>lower</i>. I would also, if you haven't guessed this, cut the military budget dramatically.<p>Once BI is in place, you don't need the patchwork of semi-authoritarian and conditional welfare programs that require bureaucracies to prevent abuse and fraud or determine who should get it and who not: everyone gets it. The rest of the wealth is allowed to flow on an essentially free market (so you have a capitalistic engine on top of the socialist infrastructure).  It's freer than the one we have. For example, once everyone has basic income, you don't need a minimum wage (which is just a clumsy minimum-income program paid-for by low-end employers, who compensate by hiring less, creating unemployment).<p>No one has to work, so the least productive people probably use the option not to work, but the most productive people do a lot more: they're more creative, autonomous, and effective. Basic income wouldn't stop most people from working, but it would dramatically change <i>how</i> they work-- for the better. The net gain is positive. The worst thing about basic income is that it <i>might</i> create an underclass of entitled parasites at the bottom of society, but authoritarian corporate capitalism has a class of entitled parasites at the top of it, and that's a lot more unhealthy for society.<p>One partial fix might be to ""fix"" job searching, but internet career sites are nothing new and, while they might match talented people more efficiently with jobs, don't fix the underlying problems of corporate capitalism. Startups are great, for people privileged enough to do them and connected enough to have a shot, but in the ""real world"", bad people are on top and hold the cards.",1300499470

I grabbed Anne Hathaway's web presence from Google Trends, and Berkshire-Hathaway's performance from Google Finance.  After a little massaging, I dumped the numbers in to R, and there is indeed a reliable correlation between Anne's (per-week) web presence and B-H's weekly average close (or closest preceding close).<p>data:  hath$AnneTrend and hath$BerkClose \nt = 4.6739, df = 373, p-value = 4.135e-06\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 \n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.1372140 0.3286587 \nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.2352165<p>It's an R^2 of 0.23, which isn't much, but it's not completely spurious; Scarlett Johansson doesn't show the same pattern (there's a weak correlation, but not reliable at p < 0.05).<p>Pearson's product-moment correlation<p>data:  hath$ScarlettTrend and hath$BerkClose \nt = 1.7687, df = 373, p-value = 0.07775\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 \n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.01016440  0.19071018 \nsample estimates:\n       cor \n0.09120053<p>However, Scarlett's career hasn't mirrored Anne's all that well.  What about someone a little closer to Anne, say, her Oscar co-host, James Franco?  Note that apart from that, the two haven't really done anything together (<a href=""http://imdb.to/g6vwbp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imdb.to/g6vwbp</a>), although I'd say they've both come to fame recently.<p>data:  hath$JamesTrend and hath$BerkClose \nt = 4.5991, df = 372, p-value = 5.826e-06\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 \n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.1336854 0.3256934 \nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.2319475<p>And that might be the clincher.

This was either not possible or unreasonably priced so I ended up with two independent tickets, one for the Zurich -> SF round trip and another with a SF -> BA round trip. Well the BA -> SF return stopped in NYC one day and  SF -> Zurich stopped there the next day and I didn't see much point flying across the country on consecutive days, so I tried to cancel those legs of my ticket (buying the ticket without these superfluous legs would have cost $2000 more than what I bought). Cancelling the first cross-country flight was going to cost around $200 so instead I just walked out of the airport in NYC after clearing customs.<p>I tried to cancel the second, but Continental told me that I couldn't cancel part of the trip and would have to rebook with no credit from my existing ticket (a 1-way NYC -> ZRH would be $2700, compare to a round trip at $600). Fortunately, the NYC -> ZRH leg was operated by Lufthansa which apparently doesn't talk very closely with Continental because they didn't blink an eye when I showed up at the airport after ""missing"" the Continental flight from SF. Had Continental been operating the last leg, they would have turned me away and I'd have been stuck buying a new ticket, but still better off than formally cancelling because of not paying the cancellation fee.<p>I had hoped that ubiquitous online travel indexing would bring some sanity to the airline pricing model, but this does not seem to be happening. I fail to see how having ticketed passengers that don't plan to fly, financially rewarding passengers for being deceptive about which flights they will board, and incentivising mixed-carrier tickets for the flexibility they lend is helpful to their bottom line.",1300498154

I used to be adamant that this was the right way to go (and I still appreciate the pattern), but then I found that just following the convention of prefixing private members with an underscore worked fine--most people understand that it means ""private"".

It's bitten me a couple of times, both in cases where a family member had just died or was about to die, and so I'm not inclined to be charitable.<p>Most recently, I had an issue where I was scheduled to fly home for Thanksgiving, but my father's condition worsened suddenly a week before then (he'd been in the hospital for about a month before) and the nurses informed me he wasn't going to make it until then.  I looked into moving up my flight by a week - it was significantly more expensive than just buying a new ticket.  I also looked into buying a one-way ticket: it was also more expensive than buying a roundtrip with a random end date.  So I just bought a completely new round-trip ticket, ate the cost of the old one, and didn't show up for it.<p>Fine, whatever, I had the money and didn't feel like fighting.  But maybe this is why I frequently end up with an empty seat next to me on United, even when the plane is supposedly booked solid.  (Hey, I'm also fine with that, but it seems like from a purely business perspective, the airline would want to sell that seat to somebody else...)<p>It's interesting to contrast this with Southwest, which will give you a credit for the cost of the flight if you reschedule anytime within the next year.

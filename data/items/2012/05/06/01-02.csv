But then again it has been suggested somewhere on here before that actually talking lots (i.e. not being concise) is not such a bad thing when speaking because it keeps the listener engaged. Keeping the listener engaged here means, more precisely: preventing them from being distracted from the point you are making by hijacking their thoughts for a little while longer. Inversely, if you are concise in speech you run the risk of being overlooked like a joke that doesnt have time to land. That happens to me a lot.",1336268773

Could've been the great AI depression, but we'll get over it. I think the entire disappointment spiral led the AI Community to get treated like ""wadda wadda wadda"".<p>To me it appears like when a prehistoric human finds laser technology from a crashed UFO and doesn't know what to do with it. Making him disappointed about laser technology. So before whining about how slow we find things out about ourselves, the human brain and the mind we should better invest more in education. The more people can research this topic the faster we get amazing results.<p>When the research in a topic doesn't yield a promising result it doesn't mean the researchers are incompetent, it means we just don't have enough education or researchers who can complete the puzzle.<p>Before consuming popular information:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Lasswell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Lasswell</a><p>At the time the Numenta stuff got popular, the critics also got a voice: <a href=""http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/michael/blog/2010/04/ben-goertzel-on-numenta/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/michael/blog/2010/04/ben-g...</a> and <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/08/ray_kurzweil_does_not_understa.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/08/ray_kurzweil_does...</a><p>PS: enjoy the earworm: <a href=""http://www.musick8.com/mclips/34wadda.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.musick8.com/mclips/34wadda.mp3</a>",1336268723

It's also totally fine for situations where the primary content of the file is the XML tags themselves. For example, it's got its share of irritating gaffs but overall I'm rather fond of XAML as a way to define user interface layout.<p>But I've also seen a lot of monstrosities in XML.  Situations where the tags themselves comprise 80% of the file, and yet are almost entirely redundant.  Situations where the markup primarily serves to obfuscate the data itself.  Situations where a file format changes to XML, bringing about a switch to routines that use an off-the-shelf XML parser. . . that still manage to consume twice as many lines of code as the from-scratch custom parser they replace.",1336268515

The Earth's oceans, for comparison, have a mass of about 1e18 tons.",1336266115

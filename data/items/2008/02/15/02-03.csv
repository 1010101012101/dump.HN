The people we dealt with tended to have a massive number of problems.  Sometimes it was outright drug use or mental illness.  Other times it was simply never having any pattern of success in life.  They wouldn't know how to make appointments, present themselves decently, be consistent, or talk intelligently.<p>I came to several conclusions:<p>1)  You can try to infect them with a can-do attitude all you want, but the concept of working hard to build the good life is so alien they never buy into the program.  Yes, the guy in the story is right, success does come down to attitude.  But changing someone's attitude is much, much harder than just giving out money.<p>2)  The existence of the minimum wage hurts the homeless. The people I worked with were incapable of producing $6 an hour of value for an employer.  If there was no minimum wage, they could work $2 an hour of value and then gradually work their way up.  I don't know how many would actually do this, but at least they should have the choice.  Because they are legally prevented from getting a job, they usually end up doing black market work like selling flowers or collecting cans which has no path of upward mobility.<p>3)  I tend to think supportive housing is the best you can do.  Give them stable place to live and gradually push them towards being more productive. It often ends up being cheaper than the cost of shelters + emergency room care + police monitoring of the streets.  Of course, few cities want to build this kind of housing for fear of becoming a draw for the homeless.<p>Keep in mind, I'm talking about the hardest cases.  There were people who managed to have a good attitude and rebound very quickly.  One great example was a woman who just got out of prison from drug use and was looking for a job.  We helped coach her on how to answer interview questions about her past, and she ended up getting a job at Sears.",1203043345

I don't think that has any influence on the experience that he did ultimately write about.<p>If the article is true, this man turned $25 into an apartment, a truck, and $5,000 in savings in under a year. It shows that it can be done, at least for a single random sample. I hope that the fact that he wrote a book about his experience doesn't prevent people from seeing the result of the experiment.",1203041338

Take the top 200 sites (by traffic) and show many how many have a single founder.<p>The number to optimize is your chance of getting ANY payday- not your percentage of ownership.  Would you trade 50% of your company to increase your chance of success from 2.1% to 4.2%?  I have no idea what those numbers are (but I suspect that a co-founder more than doubles your shot at success)...  But if you're more concerned with personal wealth than having a successful company, you're already a step behind.<p>If you think you'll just run out and get some funding so you can ""hire"" a partner, you should consider that savvy investors are thinking one of two things:<p>1) This guy either isn't persuasive enough or doesn't have a good enough idea to get a co-founder, OR<p>2) This guy is jealously guarding his equity, when he could add 50 hours a week of free and passionate labor from someone with a (hopefully) complementary skillset OR<p>3) This guy isn't smart enough to know that he doesn't have all of the skills and answers to pull off v1 of this thing.",1203040932

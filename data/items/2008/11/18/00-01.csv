In the Erlang language for example: It is completely functional but threads actually become somewhat stateful and ultimately end up recreating some similar scenarios for OOP programmers. On top of that, functions themselves showcase an even higher amount of reusability at times especially in functional languages because of the prevalence of lists of things and tuples. This prevents an over abundance of duplicate implementations of the same thing that, even though their signatures are identical (or nearly so) can't interoperate because they haven't been specified as exactly the same. So language wide consistency is a big plus for some functional languages.<p>Having said that no one tool is a golden hammer. OOP and Functional programming are just tools and there are others out there. Some not even based on Von Neumann architectures that are even more flexible than the ones we, Von Neumann proggies, are (think data flow architectures for example).",1226969829

If you can do it through someone else's business then even better. You are simply reducing the calculated risk.<p>A few years ago several bartenders and waitresses went out and bought investments properties because another bartender had done it and made lot of money. They had a few properties, incorporated their business and rolled over the taxes, and got loans easily. That did not make them entrepreneurs. Those business owners helped to drive house prices all the way up, then all the way down taking the economy with them along the way.<p>On the other hand, take Google. A great search engine, a good amount of visitors who love the product. But someone outside the founders came up with Adwords and executed it pretty well. That s an entrepreneur.",1226969519

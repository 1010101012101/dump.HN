But you bet your buttons that it'll be <i>all over</i> the internet within ours.<p>Sure, it probably wouldn't even cause a blip to the stock price, but it's a huge amount of harm for a single person to cause.<p>I once worked for a company where anybody can push changes to prod without much feedback whatsoever. Certain more senior guys watched the commit logs for any obvious shenanigans or idiocy, but generally changes were within customers' hands within a day or two (and this was a desktop app!). They suffered some horrifying stability problem for a while that necessitated some new policies. It was certainly liberating to work in that environment, but I can see why many places have safeties in place.",1227909576

379580,comment,379301,379484,0,0,jamess,,,"Your fundamental assumption is totally wrong. You simply cannot calculate the signature once and then store it and use it forever after, even for static content. That leaves you open to a whole class of attacks from a simple replay on up. To protect yourself, you'd need at minimum a nonce supplied by the client per request.<p>You've given no thought to exactly what the signature would be over, nor how having one or more untrusted caches between you and the client might affect the content. If you think you can merely sign the payload, not the headers, think again. Where exactly do cookies live? What effect can the status line have on a client's behaviour? Now ask yourself, what are caches allowed to do a request without stepping outside the bounds of the standard? Yes, exactly.<p>You haven't addressed at all how the client would even get hold of the public key needed to verify the signature. You haven't addressed what the signature is over in the event the server uses some content encoding like gzip, or the chunked encoding. You don't even add the obvious and trivial optimisation that the signature would be best sent as a trailer rather than a header, neither do you define the behaviour if the server wishes to send trailer fields after the HTTP payload.<p>The only thing that can be concluded from this is that you don't really understand security or indeed HTTP. I'm baffled by the attitude that you admit you don't know anything about these topics, but you're trying contribute something to the field anyway. This is completely arse backwards, and in no other field of endeavour would anyone even consider tolerating it. Would a peer reviewed biology journal look kindly on me if I sent them my thoughts on protein folding? I think not.<p>The attitude that any software engineer can do security is prevalent in the industry and gets us in to ridiculous amounts of trouble. You wouldn't believe how many software and hardware products I've seen that are completely broken security wise thanks to this.

Just be sure he knows that you are growing and you'll be placing a big order every few months.<p>First go to the Dell website and price out the equipment.  Then when you're speaking to the sales guy, tell him you priced it out on the website and it came out to about 88% of the actual price the site gave you.<p>Then tell him you've heard that talking to the sales guy is the way to start a business relationship and that you were hoping he could quote it out for you.  Tell him you're ready to make the purchase decision immediately but the pricing has to make sense.  Tell him the pricing on the website looks like it's marked up quite a bit.<p>It may take him a day or more to generate the quote.<p>Be aware that he has tremendous room to wiggle on some items, but not on others.  Last order I placed the salesman could discount heavily some items but not others.  You don't really care as long as the overall price makes sense.  So when you eventually go over the quote with him, be sure to focus on your ""budget"" for the equipment, and not on where the specific pricing comes from.<p>You should also have a simultaneous dialog like this going with a rep from any other companies you'd buy from.<p>To the salesperson, the equation is effort vs time.  If he knows you're ready to buy soon, then he has every incentive to make you a good deal b/c in a day the sale will be made and so he'll be willing to take a small commission in exchange for a quick sale.  He has some constraints about how he can price items, but has a lot of flexibility on price.<p>If you're buying 10 to 20 servers you should be looking at least a 25% discount off of the website price.  The only reason they publish those prices is to give the salesperson a starting point to work down from (or to sucker naive shoppers into paying full price via the web).<p>You want to come across as decisive and ready to buy at all times, if only he can solve the ""issues with the pricing"".<p>Frankly Dell's sales process stinks, and it is annoying to have to work with some of the salespeople there.  But I've saved a substantial amount of money over the web prices by negotiating with them, so it's worth it.<p>You may also be able to save money by modifying some of the configurations slightly, b/c Dell lets salespeople discount based on the need to move inventory.<p>Don't be afraid to tell the salesperson it's OK if he needs to ask permission from his manager to make the deal, but that you're eager to get the order placed today.  Tell him he can put you on hold while he speaks to the manager.<p>Good luck!",1227909160

379565,comment,379471,379534,0,0,e1ven,,,"I'll add another vote for Dells-<p>a) Their servers rack very nicely, particularly when you're using Dell racks. No tools are necessary, which saves a Lot of time when you're setting up/moving the machines.<p>b) The management tools are much better than you get from SuperMicro/offbranded machines- You can generally find a hardware fault quickly from their boot CDs, rather than diagnosing manually.<p>c) As Kyle mentioned, the parts are ubiquitous- Dell still carries parts for most of their machines, but even if you can't find it from them, you can find it from another vendor.<p>d) Because Dells are so common, it's easy to find other's experiences with a software/hardware combination.
<a href=""http://en.community.dell.com/forums/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.community.dell.com/forums/</a><p>e) Support. Don't underestimate this when choosing what vendor to buy from.. With one of out offbrand vendors, a replacement drive took at least 2 weeks to be shipped out and arrive.. If you pay for the Dell premium support ($200ish per server), they'll drive a tech to the spot within hours.<p>They're less than ideal on storage pricing- It's often cheaper to buy drives elsewhere.. Further, their live reporting tools (Check HD status, etc), aren't as good as they really should be.<p>I'd certainly call up a sales rep and have a chat with them. They'll usually give you a discount if you're buying any quantity- If they hesitate, ask if they'll throw in free gold support. They'll normally do that to save a sale, since it doesn't cost the rep very much.<p>-Colin",1227908440

That's great for reference, but not so great when you're trying to learn it.  The documentation for SPL (largely <a href=""http://www.php.net/~helly/php/ext/spl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.php.net/~helly/php/ext/spl/</a> ) is an example. The php.net website has traditionally been good for both reference and learning.<p>On the other hand, a lot of that ""bad advice out there"" is actually in the PHP documentation (like building query strings directly), which has caused it to pop up in other places.  The comments on the documentation nodes are a great idea, but use anything in them with caution.  If one comment says ""Here's how I solved this problem..."" there might already be function that did that and the poster didn't know about it.<p>As for pass by reference working with objects but not arrays... I think a lot of confusion over this comes from PHP4's crappy object model when objects were passed by value (which doesn't make any sense in an object model) and that people like to think of arrays like C arrays (which are just pointers).  That arrays are not passed by reference by default seems to fit the immutability of other base types (however, I use the word ""immutability"" with caution there, since it's not strict immutability in PHP).",1227907424

Those kinds of companies are the exception. I hope Heroku has rigorous testing and scrutinizes every change, even though they are a startup.<p>Let's say I own a video site and I want to add threaded comments. If I have 5 users and the site goes down for 5 minutes, those 5 users will get 5 minutes each of annoyance. If I have a million users, each of those users will get 5 minutes of annoyance each also. There is no difference to the user there. So, by adding more checks to make sure the site doesn't go down for 5 minutes when you have more users, you're saying the more users you have, more the important each user becomes. I think that's a strange way of thinking.<p>(The same is true here of an infrastructure service-- if S3 had 5 users and were more cavalier about their release schedule and broke something, those 5 users would exact the same net effects of downtime as if S3 had 5 million users.)<p>The awesome benefit of getting threaded comments developed, tested briefly, and pushed in one evening is worth the risk of 5 minutes of downtime compared to the 2 weeks of rigorous testing and approval-by-committee.

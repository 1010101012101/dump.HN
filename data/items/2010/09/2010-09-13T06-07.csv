This is our secret advantage: <a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/may/27/america-my-new-found-land/?pagination=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/may/27/america...</a><p>> <i>By far the best thing about America is its universities. Not Harvard, Yale, e tutti quanti: though marvelous, they are not distinctively American—their roots reach across the ocean to Oxford, Heidelberg, and beyond. Nowhere else in the world, however, can boast such public universities. You drive for miles across a godforsaken midwestern scrubscape, pockmarked by billboards, Motel 6s, and a military parade of food chains, when—like some pedagogical mirage dreamed up by nineteenth-century English gentlemen—there appears…a library! And not just any library: at Bloomington, the University of Indiana boasts a 7.8-million-volume collection in more than nine hundred languages, housed in a magnificent double-towered mausoleum of Indiana limestone.</i><p>> <i>A little over a hundred miles northwest across another empty cornscape there hoves into view the oasis of Champaign-Urbana: an unprepossessing college town housing a library of over ten million volumes. Even the smallest of these land grant universities—the University of Vermont at Burlington, or Wyoming’s isolated campus at Laramie—can boast collections, resources, facilities, and ambitions that most ancient European establishments can only envy.[fn1]</i><p>> <i>...</i><p>> <i>My own perspective is still colored by that year in Davis. Originally the agricultural extension of the University of California, precariously perched amid the rice paddies of the Sacramento River delta—halfway between San Francisco and nowhere in particular—UC Davis now boasts 3.3 million volumes, a world-class research faculty, and the country’s leading green energy program. Some of the most interesting colleagues I know have spent their lives in Davis. At the time, however, this was a mystery to me: the year completed, I retreated cautiously to the Olde English familiarity of Cambridge. But nothing was quite the same. Cambridge itself felt somehow reduced and constricting: the pancake-flat Fenland as remote as any rice paddy. Everywhere is somewhere else’s nowhere.</i><p>> <i>[fn1]: By way of comparison, the University Library in Cambridge, England, boasts just seven million volumes; the University of Vienna (founded in 1365) just 6.6 million.</i>",1284360821

But I also think that the problem of ""the user not reading the app  description"" (as described by the parent) is a separate issue.<p>For example, I found that there were several problems to be solved that were all related to the same domain. Apps existed that do a decent job of solving problem X. So I wrote an app to solve problem Y. I have received numerous 1-star reviews because the user is disappointed that my app does not solve Problem X. In my case, I am pretty confident that I clearly described the problem solved by my app.  I even explicitly say that it is not meant to solve problem X. 
I have also received many positive reviews from users looking for an app that solves Problem Y. So in my case, I don't think it was a problem with understanding the user.",1284360772

I'm at kind of a crossroads: I want to make a site that will feature a web based editor for text files in some markup languages aimed for non-developer users, but I want to offer them the ability to track changes to those files and maybe even ""fork"" and ""merge"" other documents/document-clusters; again, all via a web interface. Basically, you could say that it's like a web-based github for non-devs.<p>I could use a key-value store like couchdb or cassandra to store diffs between times when something is saved to show histories and do merges with one of the strategies git uses; and <i></i><i>maybe</i><i></i> in the future let users use a desktop app and thus clone/push/pull changes like a regular git hosting site. Again, in a skimmed non-dev approach to git.<p>For the record, this talk has practically convinced me of using git http://www.techscreencast.com/language/ruby/using-git-in-ruby-applications---scott-chacon-/1431 because I realize that it might seem overkill at first but I don't want to end up reinventing git. But a little n00b voice in my head still screams overkill.<p>So, hackerworld, what's your take on this? I mean, I could just do something with the [ruby](http://github.com/mojombo/grit)/(python)[http://gitorious.org/git-python] interfaces to git and something like gitosis, or create my own subset of file history management like said above; what would be the wisest choice?",1284359897

1685783,comment,1684595,1684595,0,0,dtsingletary,,,"One point not being made here is that nearly every wireless carrier requires you to add an Enterprise Data Plan to your service in order to use an Exchange connector.  AT&T requires this with the iPhone.  Verizon, T-Mobile, etc. all require it for the Blackberry.  I haven't heard of a single device/provider that doesn't require an elevated service level to allow for enterprise mail access.<p>So there's a security by obscurity to start with: the average user doesn't know to ask for the Enterprise plan, let alone what Enterprise even means in context.  So the scenario here requires that a) the salesman talked them into it, b) they bought into that service for the extra $15 on top of the data plan, or c) they consulted with the company's IT department or policies and knew they had to get that service.  If they didn't, they simply cannot connect to the Exchange account.   There's very little ""oops, I didn't know what I was doing"" here.  I hope that most companies have a clear policy against checking your work e-mail from personal devices, and on your own time.  There are legal implications for overtime pay.  We may look the other way in startups, but this can't always be done.<p>Most law firms require this, unilaterally.  It's part of the deal-- we'll pay your enterprise data plan in exchange for knowing that we may wipe the device, control which apps you can install [this is another can of worms], so on and so forth, per the requirements of malpractice insurance and data security.<p>In a perfect world this wouldn't be required, but I think we all know this can't possibly be the case in many industries.",1284359889

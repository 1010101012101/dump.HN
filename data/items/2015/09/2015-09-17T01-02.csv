It steals conceptually from Lisp machines (language-based kernel)<p>These two concepts being so close together (&quot;minimalism&quot; and &quot;Lisp&quot;) is practically an oxymoron, as far as Common Belief Structures go.<p>Minimalism is 6502 machine code as written by someone who honestly believes assemblers make code go slower. Don&#x27;t you know that? /s<p>Meanwhile, this:<p>> It boots to a JITting Lisp-like REPL<p>... is basically Dalvik/Android.

However even after years of putting together a top notch team I am still one of the best engineers in the company. My position means I can&#x27;t do much technical work any more, but there have been many occasions where customer problems that some of the most capable people in the company couldn&#x27;t solve were easily solved by me in a short time ,and its pretty common for me to assist the team to finish projects when the schedule gets tight or contribute to the design of key components of various products.<p>So what do the smartest people in a company do.

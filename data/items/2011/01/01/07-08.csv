Then in January they said that that wasn't going to happen. A few months later they said that they shipped to super-early preorderers and:<p>""The next batch of units will ship no later July 30th, 2010. Based on your pre-order date (01/19/2010), you should expect your WakeMate no later than 07/30/2010, but probably significantly sooner.""<p>Coincidentally, that was April 1st.<p>Then in August they said we'd be getting them in September.<p>In the end, it took overnight shipping to get them to some people by Christmas.<p>I understand and accepted that it would be ready when it was ready, but I can definitely see how hearing ""Soon"" for a year would disappoint people.",1293868613

And can you imagine recommending it now to anyone? How do you think WakeMate has spread? Probably word of mouth, which if that channel hasn't closed forever will now come with a big bold asterisk.<p>I wish you guys the best. It's going to be hard work to not only improve your product, deal with the financials but recover consumer trust. A good idea might be some new awesome, but some what gimmicky feature, that will wow everyone.",1293868525

So if you aren't going to put the up-front investment into building your system so it can scale quickly then it frequently doesn't make sense to use amazon as it is more expensive.<p>Further, EC2 has a lot of uncool attributes, like low and inconsistent IO throughput both from machine to machine and to EBS, certain limits about the network configurations, and the fact that you have to go the ""let it fail"" route instead of trying to just have redundancy within a machine.  ""Let it fail"" works for certain kinds of workloads and architectures and requires more complex software.",1293867752
2057360,comment,2056978,2057052,0,0,pjscott,,,"Looking back, though, it's kind of surprising how many times we seem to have narrowly dodged the Malthusian bullet. Famine was coming... and then the Haber-Bosch ammonia synthesis process was invented. Famine was coming... and then new crops like dwarf wheat came along just in the nick of time. Most recently, we're seeing a remarkable leveling off of the world population, without needing any sort of coercive population controls.<p>Sometimes, the world really does work out surprisingly well. (This makes sense, of course. If the world was always worse than we expected, without any surprisingly good luck, we would just become more pessimistic until the world started pleasantly surprising us again. Still, hooray.)",1293867749

2057340,comment,2054992,2055822,0,0,dkarl,,,"Okay, that kicks ass.  You got my email address; I can't wait to use the product.<p>1.  You got on my good side when I saw young Arnie.  That's awesome.  I hope if you need permission you get it, because it would be a shame to lose him.  I got an instant flashback to ""Pumping Iron"" and how charismatic and inspiring he is in that movie (despite being a dick.)<p>2.  I got briefly annoyed at the initial screenshot.  It's obviously a screenshot, but it contains instructions to close the locker door, and I just could not stop myself from spending thirty seconds trying to close the locker door even though I knew it wouldn't work.  It's hard to explain, but I just <i>had</i> to try to close the locker door before I could move on.  I bet some people will be legitimately confused, too.  Screenshots are okay as long as they don't contain instructions telling you to interact with them!<p>3.  Clicking through, looks cool, looks cool, being sold, and then BAM I'm completely sold on the screenshot that shows I can earn stuff for my friends and vice-versa.  For many people it's a lot harder to let other people down than it is to let themselves down.  I immediately thought of a certain friend who's a rather extreme case, but it applies to me, too.  My first breakthrough in fitness, when I went from a wannabe exerciser to a guy who actually does work out a few times a week, was when I had a roommate who recruited me as her running partner.  Social pressure, not wanting to send my friend out running alone when she was asking for my support, pulled me through a lot of tough times when I really, really didn't want to work out, and then when I moved out a year later I found I was, for the first time in my life, capable of pushing through those tough times by myself.  I bet your product will accomplish the same thing for a lot of people -- you MUST do this!",1293865770
2057339,comment,2057157,2057157,0,0,nkurz,,,"You mention that you've tried exercising in the morning, but have you tried an afternoon schedule instead?  Not that I've got this figured out, but I've been pretty athletic most of my life, and have never found a way to make a morning workout enjoyable.  But something very physical in the evening keeps me fully awake until I go to sleep, and then helps me sleep more solidly.<p>If your effects are seasonal, Vitamin D might certainly be worth trying.  Diet certainly makes a difference, as others have pointed out. Don't necessarily assume that less is better: hungry people can be pretty lethargic too.  Consider eating more and exercising to match.  And I wouldn't necessarily give up on the idea of just sleeping in two shifts: going to sleep when you are tired, waking up and working without distraction from midnight-3am, and then sleeping until morning will get an awful lot done.",1293865671

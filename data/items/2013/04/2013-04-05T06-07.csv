Or the people selling things for bitcoin who will get more and more value over time without having to increase prices.<p>It would hurt people who borrow money, but that's not what bitcoin is primarily used or was intended to be used for, and the interest rate people borrow money at could just be adjusted accordingly. (Which would then encourage people to loan instead of hoard as the amount of bitcoins they get back at the end of the day would be the same either way, but this way they would get interest on top of it. So your ""hoarding"" problem is self correcting anyways.)<p>If someone was hoarding bitcoins it doesn't hurt or affect anyone else. Your central bank inflating it wouldn't just punish hoarders, but everyone who used the currency. To the benefit of whatever group controlled it or got the newly ""minted"" bitcoins.<p>Bitcoin does have a built in way of inflating the currency by people ""mining"" more of it, but that was a necessary evil of getting the first bitcoins into circulation relatively fairly. There is no actual benefit of having people wasting vast amounts of computing power otherwise, or making everyone else's money worth less.",1365145182

The finance literature has some fascinating articles on this dating back as far as the late 80s (look for Desai 2002, J of Finance, Asquith 2005 J Fin Econ, or most recently <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1570451"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1570451</a>).<p>The intuition behind this signal as a market inefficiency, or 'anomaly' is that the market sees short sellers as informed investors, the so called 'smart money', and there is a herding effect to follow their trades which generates abnormal returns. The same logic can be applied to disclosed insider trades or institutional holdings filings made public via the SEC's EDGAR database.<p>Fawce's slick implementation of a 'Days to Cover' signal is a great way to highlight the power of aiming new tools like Quantopian at freely available public data stores (which exist expressly to increase market transparency). And sure, it doesn't go the whole way for you on execution details like borrow costs, liquidity etc. but those aspects tend to be unique to each trader.",1365144890

But for the network, that would look like you sending both $99 and $1 to new(?) addresses.<p>Anyway, the 7M unspent BTC are all ""change"" that hasn't been spent yet.  So your 99 BTC in your example <i>is</i> hoarded: You got 100 BTC somewhere, and spent 1, but you haven't spent the rest.
If you eventually spend your 99 BTC change, it will be sent from the address that was formerly hoarding it. But if you get 98 BTC back in change to a fresh address, that's 98 BTC you haven't spent.<p>But if you ever really spend that 98 BTC, then the person you send them to may be accused of hoarding -- if they use a fresh address for more anonymity.<p>So in a sense all BTC ever recieved to privacy-defending users will always appear to be hoarded by their most recent owners. A better measure of hoarding then would be the 7M (owned by non-spenders) divided by transaction volume.

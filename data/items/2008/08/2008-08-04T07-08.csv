It remains to be seen if the platform is still viable once the dust has settled down.",1217836263
266096,comment,265897,266021,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Most folks who say Perl is ugly are talking about one of two things (or both): Sigils or Regular Expressions.<p>Regular Expressions have turned out to be so useful that they've been slurped into every modern language (and using the Perl interpretation of regex to boot), so it's pretty much a null statement to say that Perl is ugly because of regular expressions...because it means every language is ugly.  This is usually what people mean when they call Perl executable line noise...but is it really the fault of Perl that folks write regexes that are longer and more complex than is readable?  Perl just happens to be a culture that is steeped in UNIX history, and sometimes we reach for a regex before other more readable tools...it's a failing of the developer, rather than the language.  I find regexes in Python quite ugly, myself, since they're in the ghetto of a library rather than a first class part of the language.  In Perl, you can take a reference to a regex, or turn it into an object, and of course, you can use regexes extremely concisely and in one-liners and quick throwaway scripts.  I consider this a worthwhile tradeoff.<p>Sigils, on the other hand, are core to the language and Perl uses them more heavily than almost any other modern language (PHP and Ruby both use them to some degree, but nowhere near the degree of Perl), so if it's not the sort of thing you like, then Perl is not the sort of thing you'll like.  This one, at least is a point of real difference.<p>I don't find sigils particularly offensive or particularly nice; I'm pretty much indifferent to them.  Though I am happy to know that the inconstant sigils of Perl 5 are going away in Perl 6, as they've been a source of confusion for me on many an occasion (though less so when I'm working with Perl a lot--I haven't written a bug in weeks due to that particular quirk, and I don't think I've ever written one that the compiler didn't catch immediately).  References are also problematic, and will also be made prettier in Perl 6 (in particular, function references are automagic when it is apparent that's what you want to happen).<p>My first dynamic language (if I don't count tinkering with ARexx on my Amiga when I was a kid...and I don't) was Perl, and I worked with it for several years.  Then I went to work in a Python shop, luckily with some of the best Python developers in the world working on some of the most interesting Python code going (if you use Python, you use some code written by several of the folks I was working with), and I really enjoyed working in Python and found it ""cleaner"" than the Perl I was accustomed to.<p>After a few years with Python, I found myself working with Perl again...and I set myself the task of learning it a bit more systematically then I had the first time around.  Turns out, Perl is a quite pretty language...and I like it better than Python.  Both are very fine languages, but Perl suits me better.  I was merely judging some extremely nice Python written by masters of the language vs. random snippets of Perl found on the Internet, and unsurprisingly Perl fared poorly in the comparison.<p>Ruby, on the other hand...I might actually find it prettier than Perl--it has a lot of the things I love about Perl, and very few of its rough edges.  Though I'm not fond of the seeming standard usage of ""end"" for blocks.  You guys know you don't have to use those, right?  I mean, it's not Pascal.  You can use curly braces, and it'll work just fine...and bouncing on % works.  I'm also not fond of the occasional verbosity of Ruby that seems to be a function of its ""everything is an object"" philosophy.<p>Anyway, beauty is in the eye of the beholder...and conciseness is one of my primary ""beautiful"" qualities.  And, if Perl is anything, it is concise (at least, it <i>can</i> be, and for almost any task).",1217836053

Google search now is basically a way to find the site thats best at being found by Google, not necessary the best content. Usually when I search for something that gets spammed I don't find any good links until page 4-5.<p>If there was one list where the person did the groundwork to find the best links for each category that'd be much better. I mean whatever the category almost all the information is repeated between the links. So there is really no reason to list 10 different links that compare an LLC to a C-Corp.",1217835338

266088,comment,265911,265911,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"So we seem to have these facts:
The iPhone platform is a commercial success for Apple.
The iPhone platform is a commercial success for 3rd party devs.
The iPhone platform is tightly controlled by a vendor whose actions range from understandable lies to misleading behaviour and outright bullying.<p>So, is there anything to be criticised or is commercial success a justification for everything that is lawful?<p>I think being the uber cool bully who lends his followers success for a while but may turn against them at any moment is a dangerous long term strategy.<p>It basically means that Apple's growth rates must keep up with the inconvenience caused by their behaviour. And I don't mean just intellectual inconvenience that affects only a small number of people (closed vs open platforms, etc). I mean getting harassed by a vendor has a cost and that cost needs to be covered by growth. It's as simple as that.",1217834833

266079,comment,265990,265990,0,0,unalone,,,"Bloggers really have to learn to edit their posts. Not even as a disagreement with ""open for open's sake"" but as a matter of writing quality in general. Bloggers just don't write well.<p>""To reach the rest, we will keep turning people into Firefox users, and pressure Apple, Microsoft and other vendors to support Vorbis and Theora.""<p>That's a complete waste of a sentence. ""To get people who don't use our product to use this format, we will make them use our product.""<p>""Isn't Theora inferior to H.264, so no-one will use it? Theora isn't bad on an absolute scale --- look at some demos to see for yourself.""<p>Can't they just say that it's inferior, and say it straight out? Double talk fools nobody. Something like ""It's inferior, but not by much - and a growing community online is trying to use entirely open formats. (Try it yourself here.)""<p>""Even if it's slightly lower quality than H.264 at some bit rates, it's still going to be very useful to people who favour free formats on principle, or who need an open-source solution, or who want a solution that Just Works across platforms without plugins, or who just want a solution without licensing fees --- for example, if you just want a convenient way to use a video clip in a Web app.""<p>First off - DO you have to pay Adobe to use Flash commercially? I was not aware of this.<p>Second - liking something just because it's free is and always will be stupid. People don't use Firefox because it's free. They use it because they think it's the best browser, and by some arguments it is. Similarly, a post like this would serve better purpose to be open about the practical advantages of Ogg, rather than to try and preach to the masses.<p>This is something that I've become increasingly annoyed with over the last few months regarding the Firefox team: they've become less like visionaries and more like evangelists. Reading this was like seeing Firefox's download page for 3: the See How We Stack Up comparison with Safari.<p>Compatible with modern Web pages and technologies - both<p>Active security features like anti-phishing and anti-malware - Firefox<p>Battle-tested security process and the industry’s fastest response times - Firefox<p>Thousands of ways to personalize your online experience	- Firefox<p>100% free and open source software - Firefox<p>That is a pure propaganda bit and Mozilla knows it. The important bit is the compatibility, and by Acid3 standards, Firefox is LESS compatible than Safari (and Webkit blows it away, of course). The quick response times is really a tie. ""Battle-tested"" means nothing. I know people like plug-ins, but ""online experience"" is another marketing term. It doesn't really matter in terms of competition whether or not something is open source, but Safari IS ""100% free."" ""Active security features"" is legitimate, but that's only one point in Firefox's advantage, and - of course - they leave out Safari's advantages as well. While I know this is standard practice for competition, Firefox would win me over much more if they cut the crap and were honest about ""Okay, you might like us more IF you do the following things a lot, and you might NOT like us if you do such-and-such.""<p>This point, and my following points about aesthetic of writing, don't seem to bother many other people here. The art of honesty is one that doesn't hold much water online, so it seems. People online are much happier with imprecision and selective dishonesty than they should be, and it's something that worries me about developing culture.<p>That's my main argument; what follows is merely aesthetic nitpicking rather than nitpicking on content.<p>""Vendor pressure must come from content providers dedicated to making compelling content available in free formats (coupled with a superior playback experience in Firefox).""<p>This sentence is just terrible and seems to shift subject and tense as it does. Vendor pressure - the noun here seems like it should be vendor, but it's pressure - must come from content providers - an empty term - dedicated to making compelling content - compelling is compelling regardless of format - available in free formats - but, of course, this is self-obvious (because, the ""pressure"" is the pressure to use open formats; therefore, any pressure to use open formats must come from open format users) - coupled with a superior playback experience in Firefox - not only is ""experience"" a terrible word that's overused in this post, but this post should have to do with Ogg Vorbis and not promoting Firefox. That hurts the cause of Ogg, when its promoter is only promoting it to promote itself.<p>""This is a great example of why Mozilla and Firefox are important. The Web needs a high-market-share browser vendor committed to free software and open standards across the board.""<p>This is not a great example, because open formats are not necessarily important, never have been, and most likely never will be. They've been nice, of course, but they're always an added luxury rather than a main feature. The web does not ""need"" these things. It might ""benefit from"" them, but it does not need them. Also, needless to say, there's so much fluff in this sentence. This writer is terrible.<p>""The answer is simple""<p>Yes, but it wasn't explained simply.<p>And it's funny, as an afterthought, because almost every programmer I know is precise with language to a fault. The person writing this is not writing as a programmer. He is not writing from a logical point of view. He is writing as a marketer, which almost guarantees that he knows he's being deceptive with his language.<p>Here's how he could have written that post and made it shorter but better.<p>""Matt Asay doesn't understand why shipping Ogg Vorbis and Theora in Firefox is important. The answer is simple. Open video/audio formats are not widely supported as of yet - and we believe that open formats help keep the web free and equal. By giving 100 million users Ogg support, we're making it a format that's less risky for developers, which may pressure other companies into supporting the format as well.<p>""Is Ogg equal to H.264? Not quite, but it's good - check it out for yourself. And quality is only improving. We would love to offer open codecs for H.264 in the meantime, but until something changes, we can't.<p>""Wasn't this already available on Firefox? Yes - but as a plugin. We feel that supporting Ogg out-of-the-box meant one less step for the end user - and that means that overall, Ogg is a hundred million steps closer to being an actual alternative format. Making formats difficult to use is bad for everybody, even developers and users that prefer other formats.""<p>Of course, Mozilla wouldn't mention usability nowadays, since usability design isn't nearly as high a priority as it was even with Firefox 2.",1217833394

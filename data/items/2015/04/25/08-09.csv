9437733,comment,9437641,9437642,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"It&#x27;s easy to forget that things change, and change tends to be exponential. What YouTube did was remove the hassle and fiction in posting videos online. It used to take a lot of effort, and many people who didn&#x27;t know enough didn&#x27;t realize the complexities involved.<p>The author here calls youtube an ftp site, and in doing so ignores what set youtube apart. Youtube automatically transcoded videos, it played videos in your browser inline with other content, and it was free. All you had to do was make your video small enough to upload and YouTube did the rest. You didn&#x27;t have to worry about codecs, or hosting, or bandwidth Nichols, or domain registration, or any of that. Previously if you wanted to host a video online you had to optimize the encoding, pay for bandwidth, and worry about compatibility depending on encoding. Then your video would be viewed by a browser plugin, usually as a bare video.<p>Plus there was a catch-22, if your video got too popular it would cost a ton of money to host. Youtube got rid of all that hassle, and in so doing naturally started to acquire content and users. Once the critical mass network effect kicked in then youtube became the default place to view and post any and all video content. From there it should have been obvious to anyone paying sufficient attention that the quality would only go up, the costs of bandwidth and servers would only go down and with a sufficient number of viewers that some monetization strategy or another was likely to be effective.<p>People made similar mistakes about tons of new technologies, the commonality is often assuming that the launch state is the end state, and not square one of a massive acceleration in sophistication, features, etc.",1429952396

The biggest argument for Gogs instead of GitLab is that despite it lacking features compared to GitLab, the much smaller amount of moving parts make it simpler to deal with. That said, GitLab is an excellent product, Gogs is just simpler in a lot of ways, which when you&#x27;re dealing with a team of 10 instead of 100 and I&#x27;m the person looking after it (and thus writing the documentation for how to manage it) makes it a better choice for that use-case :)",1429952156

If you are stopped, such that the police dog can sniff your car, then they can sniff your car. But the cops can&#x27;t stop you just to let the dog sniff, without more suspicion. Since the car is stopped for a traffic stop, it gives a chance for the dog to go work. Put it another way, the cop is standing on the side of a road near a traffic light.

It&#x27;s nice that there are attempts to remove and/or replace Intel ME, but that&#x27;s just step 1; Intel&#x27;s microcode, which has never been decrypted or reverse engineered, undoubtedly contains a lot of very software-like bits, and with the upcoming SGX, those bits are suddenly going to get quite hostile to the owner of the device, by locking the OS out from inspecting running programs.  Running from ROM or from a blob provided by firmware ought to be considered immaterial; it&#x27;s not like Stallman would be okay with running Windows as long as he stuck to version preinstalled on his device and never installed any updates.<p>I believe AMD is no better.  But ARM CPUs are getting faster and faster, and most of them have no upgradable microcode, which probably means little or no microcode at all; if you truly believe in free software, get something with one of those (and hope you can avoid the nightmare of ARM SoCs&#x27; GPUs).

Given the synthetic nature of the problem, we might assume that both Albert and Bernard are of equal ability, and able to make logical inferences based on reasonable assumptions. We&#x27;ll also assume that both Albert and Bernard are only going to announce the binary state of each others certainty of the answer.  Lastly, we&#x27;ll assume that whoever can deduce the binary state of certainty first, will speak first.<p>These assumptions, while a bit presumptuous, seem on the surface to adhere to the spirit of the puzzle.<p>Given those assumptions, what does it mean when Albert speaks first?  It means that he&#x27;s figured out the binary state of certainty before Bernard.  How could that be?<p>If Bernard has the dates 18 or 19, then he knows that he knows, and he also knows that Albert does not know.  If Bernard has any other date, he&#x27;ll know that they both don&#x27;t know.  How does Bernard make this determination?  He checks if his date is repeated anywhere.<p>Compare that to the logic that Albert must perform to rule out Bernard&#x27;s certainty.  He must check that all of the dates in his month are in fact repeated.<p>If they both perform these mental operations at the same speed, then Bernard should speak first in the case where he knows a unique date.  The only reason why Bernard might not speak first is that he must also reason through whether or not Albert might know the date at this point.  If Bernard holds an unrepeated date, the complexity of reasoning through Alberts situation boils down to considering only one month.  But if Bernard holds a repeated date, he must consider Albert&#x27;s situation for two months.<p>So, there exists a time past which Albert must know that Bernard is considering the more difficult situation, and thus he can infer that Bernard does not know.<p>If one assumes precise knowledge of the timing of logical operations, one can make even stronger inferences.  To the point of even solving the entire problem without anyone every saying anything, for specific birthdays.<p>I will be the first to admit that this line of reasoning may require certain assumptions which are strained.  Thus the question may still remain:<p>1. &quot;Why did Albert speak first?&quot;<p>Does anyone have a different set of logical assumptions which leads to Albert speaking first?<p>----<p>What this exposes really, is the more subtle assumption that the &quot;correct&quot; solution makes:<p>&quot;There is only one way to make inferences in this puzzle.&quot;<p>The truth of that statement depends very much on the assumptions one makes about the puzzle. Most problematic is that most assumptions which makes that true, make it impossible for Albert to be the first speaker.<p>It&#x27;s a kind of logical paradox brought on by the fact that synthetic logic problems do not map very well to real world situations.",1429949494

3608385,comment,3607961,3608154,1,0,pessimizer,,,"I definitely didn't write any HTML, CSS, or javascript in college, but I feel like I use algorithmic analysis stuff from there at least once an hour. Data structure stuff I use a bit less often, because I'm usually just using what I've been given by some framework - but if I have some huge bizarre piece of state that I'm passing around, knowing how to structure it or find what I want in it efficiently comes in handy.<p>Those things were a bit of a terror to learn in class, whereas the basics of HTML took a day or two, the basics of CSS took a good week or two to completely get my head around, and the worst part about javascript was getting my head around a C looking language that didn't behave at all like C. All of this was stuff I couldn't help picking up because I had to complete projects for money. Understanding how a O(n log n) algorithm looked or how fast something was going to fill up all of my ram would not have been something I learned on my own without years of experience of benchmarking and debugging, without school.<p>edit: I do share the experience of the author of not using any language that I used in college, since college. That's certainly not the fault of the languages, C++ and Java, which are still probably the most widely used outside of the web (well, servlets, but I hated Java.) But if it had been a .NET college teaching me how to automate Excel, I may have killed myself, though I have collected paychecks for doing just that, since.",1329616743

Either way, thanks for reading the post and taking the time to question whether rearranging navigation options has an impact on conversions, which pages get the most traffic, etc.<p>My view is based on my experience. When I first visited the site, I was ready to sign up. But then my eyes glanced at the navigation bar, and the blog was linked first.<p>So I clicked on 'Blog' instead of signing up.<p>As much as I was ready to sign up, I also find it very interesting to read startups' blogs, so I clicked through there and only really came back to sign up because I was planning to write a blog post about Buffer's UX. I would have bounced otherwise.<p>Moreover, the blog's masthead + logo link to the subdomain's index (i.e. the blog itself), so while there's a prominent 'Sign Up' element on the blog (credit to the Buffer team on that), my initial attempt to go back to the home page (and perhaps sign up) was met with a return to the blog. I don't think most users have much patience, and it's quite possible that people visit, get distracted by the blog, and then bounce, especially when a first attempt at going back to bufferapp.com doesn't pan out as expected.<p>Even if the order doesn't matter at all, and there's no impact from 'Blog' being first, my point is also about subdomains, as I sort of hinted at above. So when I say the current UI directs traffic away from the main site, I mean to say that if I click on 'Blog', almost all of my interaction options from there send me to somewhere else on the blog.bufferapp.com subdomain where my options are less about those on the main site (i.e. sign up, explore pricing, etc.), and more about reading posts, commenting, clicking through to the founders' Twitter pages, etc. For all I know, that interaction may somehow increase brand affinity and the likelihood of positive word of mouth for Buffer.

One week, they decided to run a promotion: you would go to the Circuit City website, pick out and customize a computer. Then, you would print out a sheet with your order number on it, <i>and go to the store to pay for it</i>.<p>It was painfully obvious to me at the time that this was probably the brainchild of some young gun marketer at HQ. ""Here's the deal,"" I imagine him saying. ""People that shop at our on-line store don't go home with as many accessories and don't purchase extended warrantees as often as our in store customers. So, we'll make sure they have to go in the store. Then we can up-sell the crap out of them! It's flawless!""<p>Later on, I worked at the Apple Store. I once had a customer come in who was trying to decide between a MacBook and some low-end model of HP. I went through everything that she would get with the MacBook that she wouldn't get with the HP, and one after the other she informed me that she wasn't all that enticed by the difference. When we finished she told me, ""I think I should get the HP.""<p>""Yeah,"" I replied, ""that's probably the right choice for you at this point. If you need another computer in the future, though, don't forget about us."" The customer was stunned. She wanted to know why I wasn't pushing her toward the Mac. ""Simple,"" I said, ""we want you to buy an Apple because it's the best product for you, not because some pushy sales-person badgered you into a sale.""<p>One of those companies is gone, one is the most valuable company in the world. Marketing on Facebook, to me, has always felt much more like Circuit City's strategy, and almost never like Apple's.",1329613648

Do you really hate Facebook (provider of a tool) or those who spam you via Facebook (users of the tool)? If you're so worried about Facebook tracking you offsite, why have an account at all?<p>I think it is right on. Both because the tool shapes the usage (if your only tool is hammer, all problems look like nails). I don't have one.",1329613551

3608256,comment,3607248,3607532,6,0,ScottBurson,,,"You can use the protocol buffer schema language to define your ASTs if you want, but I think that addresses only a relatively small part of the problem.<p>There are two larger problems in adding Lisp-style macros to non-Lisp languages, one social and one technical.<p>The social problem is that language designers must be persuaded to publish a specification of the internal representation of the AST of their language.  This makes the AST a public interface, one which they are committed to and can't easily change.  People don't like to do this without a good reason.<p>The technical problem is more difficult, though.  To make a non-Lisp language as extensible as Lisp would require making the parser itself extensible.  This is not too hard to implement, but perhaps not so easy to use.  If you've ever tried to add productions to a grammar written by someone else, you know it can be nontrivial.  You have to understand the grammar before you can modify it.<p>And if you overcome the difficulties of having one user in isolation add productions to the grammar, what happens when you try to load multiple subsystems written by different people using different syntax extensions which, together, make the grammar ambiguous?<p>I don't know that these problems are insurmountable, but a few people have taken a crack at them, and AFAIK no one has produced a system that any significant number of people want to use.<p>It's worth taking a look at how Lisp gets around these problems.  Lisp has not so much a syntax as a simple, general <i>meta</i>syntax.  Along with the well-known syntax rules for s-expressions, it adds the rule that a form is a list, and the meaning of the form is determined by the car of the list -- and if it's a macro, even the <i>syntax</i> of the form is determined thereby.<p>Add a package system like CL's, and you get pretty good composability of subsystems containing macros.  You can get conflicts, but only when you explicitly create a new package and attempt to import macros from two or more existing packages into it.<p>Applying these ideas to a conventional language gives us, I think, the following:<p>() While the grammar is extensible, all user-added productions must be ""left-marked"": they must begin with an ""extension keyword"" that appears nowhere else in the grammar.<p>() Furthermore, those extension keywords are <i>scoped</i>: they are active only within certain namespaces; elsewhere they are just ordinary names.  This requires parsing itself to be namespace-relative, which is a bit weird, but probably workable.<p>I think that by working along these lines it might be possible to add extensible syntax to a conventional language in a way that avoids both the grammatical difficulty and the composition problem.  And if you do that, maybe you can then get the relevant committees or whoever to standardize the AST representation for the language.<p>I've never taken a crack at all this myself, though, because I'm happy writing Lisp :-)",1329613383

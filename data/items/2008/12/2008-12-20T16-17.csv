java.lang.System is class, not a namespace (although classes in Java are overloaded to function as namespaces as well as modules and data type definitions). println() is not a static method, but an instance method of the java.io.PrintStream class. out is a static variable in the System class of type PrintStream which refers to an instance of that class, on which we invoke the method println().

<a href=""http://www.juliansimon.com/writings/Ultimate_Resource/TCHAR04B.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.juliansimon.com/writings/Ultimate_Resource/TCHAR0...</a><p><i>Our whole evolution up to this point shows that human groups spontaneously evolve patterns of behavior, as well as patterns of training people for that behavior, which tend on balance to lead people to create rather than destroy. Humans are, on net balance, builders rather than destroyers. The evidence is clear: the civilization which our ancestors have bequeathed to us contains more created works than the civilization they were bequeathed.<p>In short, humankind has evolved into creators and problem-solvers. Our constructive behavior has counted for more than our using-up and destructive behavior, as seen in our increasing length of life and richness of consumption.<p>This view of the average human as builder conflicts with the view of the average human as destroyer which underlies the thought of many doomsdayers. From the latter view derive such statements as ""The U.S. has 5 percent of the population, and uses 40 percent of resources,"" without reference to the creation of resources by the same U.S. population.  (Also involved here is a view of resources as physical quantities waiting for the plucking, rather than as the services that humankind derives from some combination of knowledge with physical conditions.) If one notices only the using-up and destructive activities of humankind, without understanding that constructive patterns of behavior must have been the dominant part of our individual-cum-social nature in order for us to have survived to this point, then it is not surprising that one would arrive at the conclusion that resources will grow scarcer in the future.</i>",1229791539

I think in most cases char is unisgned, i.e., in most environments, so this is not a problem. But can't you do something like:<p>char c<p>while( (c = getchar() & 0xff) != EOF) { //Do something }<p>if you are in a signed environment?<p>I think really stdio is rather like my experience with mexican food. I live in Austin, Texas now, and I love mexican food, the hotter the better, but as a kid I lived in eldritch New England, not far from the Miskatonic river, and felt I didn't ""like"" spicey food, being more used to lobster, clam chowder, and so forth. Now they can't put enough jalepenos in a burger for my liking. Similarly, being 27, and thus living in the ""java age"", I first taught myself to program with the Java SDK, which spares one from alot of these ""pitfalls"". But now I like the control, and also the relative simplicity of the API, that stdio gives one, arguably more intuitive and easier to remember than in Java, and given a choice between Java and C, I would go with the later. It is an acquired taste.<p>To paraphrase Charleton Heston:<p>""They will take my [stdio] away out my cold, dead hands!""<p>:-)",1229788906

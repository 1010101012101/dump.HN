4361312,comment,4360271,4360271,5,0,shawnee_,,,"In high school, I became yearbook editor and was entrusted with keys to certain parts of the school (darkroom, computer lab, etc).  In the late 90's, yearbooks were all done manually: film was loaded into cameras with heavy lenses, pictures were burned into photo paper and stop bath.  Some of the work in putting it together was done on a computer, enough to justify being on the computer after hours.  We'd print out pages with blank rectangles and squares for the photos, glue the manually-developed pictures onto the pages that had printed text, bind together the book, and send it off to the printer at the end of the year.  Being yearbook editor was great, always an excuse to be working on something creative.<p>I also had a key to the computer lab.  Problem was, the part of the building where the computer lab was located was not accessible after hours -- there was a gate which was locked during off school hours. (Meaning it was designed such that I could get into the room with the computers during regular school hours, out during off-hours, but not back in after hours).  This lab had about 20 computers, and live Internet access.  More than enough reason to find a way.<p>While none of my ""breaking into"" that part of the school during off-hours was done with malicious intent to steal or deface school property, it probably wasn't exactly the most lawful thing a 17 year old could have been doing.  My good student status probably helped for those rare occasions when one of the janitors or teachers would ""catch"" me in that part of the building at times when I shouldn't necessarily have been there.  ""Research for college"", was a good excuse at the time (and actually pretty close to the truth).",1344524175

4361296,comment,4355103,4360832,1,0,snowwrestler,,,"But what do you mean by ""performance""?<p>You are talking about how the advertising industry went from measuring ads statistically, to measuring them by direct action--the click. Before the Internet, the only ""ads"" that were measured by direct action were coupons, because stores could keep track of redemption transactions. Other than that, it was understood that the value of ads could not be correlated to direct actions by consumers. Sort of like how no single thunderstorm can be directly attributed to global warming.<p>It's not that online ads perform abysmally. <i>All</i> ads perform abysmally when they are measured by the metric of direct action at the moment of viewing--the Internet was just the first time that could be directly measured on every ad. DoubleClick and others established a competitive advantage by being able to slightly reduce just how abysmal the measurements were. They spent a lot of time and money ""educating"" brand owners that direct clicks were the ""right"" way to measure their value.<p>The unfortunate side effect was that the shift of ad dollars from TV and print to online was greatly slowed. Brand managers look at the super-low online click numbers (even the best numbers from profile-driven networks) and say ""what a waste of money, let's keep the bulk in prime time TV."" They get numbers from the TV industry that indicate that millions and millions of people saw their ad--and they are not under any illusion that these people are doing anything about it that very moment. TV ads are held to a much lower standard of action, and therefore TV ads attract much higher levels of investment.<p>Why should online ads be measured by clicks?? The assumption that they should is quite recent (in the context of the full history of advertising), but already deeply held and rarely considered. But it's been incredibly harmful to the efforts to shift industries like TV and newspapers online.",1344523807

There's nothing to optimize in my situation, I had more physical cores than vCPUs, so there was no over-allocation.  I get that obviously there must be some contention between the vCPUs, but to double the performance by dropping to a single vCPU?  I wouldn't see that type of performance hit on a physical system otherwise multi-process databases wouldn't exist.<p>I had another question that was arbitrarily closed as a dupe, but I made a comment disputing it, and by some small miracle, the mod removed the dupe status.  I can't remember which other question it was at this point since it was modified to remove my comment and the closing.  The point is that there is no way to flag the question as being under dispute, and if the moderator decided not to do anything about it, then I couldn't do anything (except post to meta which I just learned today).<p>EDIT: I posted the wrong link, and just corrected it now.",1344523280

In terms of game design, most games on Android are based entirely on touch input or sensor input (e.g. accelerometer), not game pad input. How many games can realistically use both control schemes effectively? I think it will turn out to be much more like how devs design around keyboard vs. gamepad for games that are both on consoles and PC, one will be preferred over another.<p>More fundamentally, many apps and games on the Android market don't support the extra large screen category that Google TV uses and therefore won't install. Of apps and games that do install, many do not test for a 10' experience. We've seen that with tablets it took quite some time and a lot of hardware sales to get devs interested in making tablet layouts, so I'm not sure that the base of people interested in Ouya will be enough to have devs even look at the TV experience.",1344522642

I had found a program on some local BBS that could resize a hard disk partition.  So on a few of the machines, I shrank C: by a few dozen megabytes and created my own D: drive and copied games into it.<p>How to hide that D drive?  With Norton DiskEdit, I figured out how to manipulate the partition table manually, setting the partition type to a null value so that DOS wouldn't see it.  Next I figured out how to read and write that disk sector in assembly language.  Soon I had a command-line executable that would hide or unhide my private partition with a single command.  Best of all, DOS would only read the partition table on boot.  So I could boot with my partition enabled, then hide it, and play games knowing that any reboot would render the partition hidden again.<p>The last thing I needed to cover up was the missing space on the C drive, which could be revealed by the DIR command.  So I wrote a memory-resident program (assembly again) that constantly scanned for the string of ""bytes free"" in video memory, and patched in a larger value.<p>Okay, now the MEM command might reveal the existence of my TSR.  So I named my program as VSAFE, which was the name of a memory-resident antivirus program on each of these machines.  I had my program output the same text as the real VSAFE did on startup, and overwrote the real VSAFE executable with my own.<p>So I had a pretty well concealed partition, that would have required some heavy duty skills to find and remove.  ""format c:"" would not affect it, and even FDISK would just show the space as empty, not a partition.  Never got caught for any of it; the computer lab supervisor and other students knew I was up to something but never found any of the hidden stuff.<p>Man, I could have had a career as a malware author...",1344522591

The primary reserves of natural gas we're tapping now have been known about for a long, long time, and there are few new discoveries in the pipeline.

4361122,comment,4360462,4360867,1,0,einhverfr,,,"I see peak oil differently.  Peak oil/energy really is meaningless as an absolute.  The only thing that really can matter is peak supply relative to demand, because this is what forces prices up and market changes.  Oil hit this peak decades ago and is continuing to crunch slowly.  Coal is likely to hit this peak soon, primarily because the cost of extraction is going up compared to yields.  This means relative shrinking in supply regardless of what is in the ground.<p>What this means to me is that energy prices, which have been supply constrained since the mid-1970's are going to continue to go up by fits and starts, and occasionally go down but it's a ratchet overall.  This does have huge ramifications all across the economy.  It won't be a drastic end like many of the peakers predict but a very slow crunch.<p>In other words, the current economic troubles will continue by fits and starts more or less since they have since oil stopped being a demand-constrained commodity.   I think you can trace most of the economic problems in recent decades to instability and supply constraints regarding energy.  This has also helped fraud along, as in the case of Enron.<p>The more we can do without oil, the more we can do.  But energy return on investment is an important problem to solve and it isn't clear we have sufficient solutions available.",1344521933

4361116,comment,4360462,4360462,8,0,mdasen,,,"I think one of the issues with the thesis that oil prices will lead to a drop in globalization is that it's actually quite fuel-efficient to ship goods.  Grabbing fast stats from Wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_efficiency_in_transportation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_efficiency_in_transportati...</a>), we see that it takes 246kJ to transport 1 tonne (2,204.6 pounds) 1km by freight rail in the United States.  By contrast, a car carrying a single person takes 3,594kJ to transport that person 1km.  Also, I think ocean-borne freight is even more favorable than rail, but I would assume that we would also have the option of creating nuclear-powered ocean-borne freight transportation given that we do this today for military vessels.<p>Freight has the advantage that it often doesn't care if it arrives 6 hours late or has to wait around a bunch.  That means that we can hit maximal loads nicely.  Businesses also tend to pre-plan (at least the ones that do well) so that they can take advantages of the efficiencies offered by going slower.<p>Passenger transportation just isn't as efficient and would seem to be under a greater squeeze.  Even if you go by Amtrak's rail service, to transport a tonne of humans (assuming the average North American body weight of 80.7kg) would use 80x as much fuel as transporting a tonne of freight.<p>Getting back to freight, a lot of the world's goods are transported by freight truck over land.  Freight trucks use 2,426kJ per tonne-kilometer.  So, something coming from China over water to the Western US would use considerably less fuel than something from New York trying to get to the Western US.  It's under 8,000mi from China to SF and (as the crow flys) 2,500mi from New York to SF.  If water-borne transit is 10x more efficient, goods from China still have a fuel advantage over freight truck.<p>If anything, we'd see the end of freight trucks before we saw the end of globalization.  Something coming from China to the Western US and then onto New York by rail would likely use less fuel than something coming from the Western US to New York by fright truck.<p>I guess I just see freight trucking and passenger trips ending considerably sooner than the water-borne and rail transit that would enable globalization to continue.",1344521860

Specifically, he would notice a price movement on the tape, tell his runner to go (for example) buy 100 at $60, but by the time the runner was actually able to execute, the price was at $80, hence he's getting a worse price. The solution back then was faster runners, then faster communication (such as hand signals), then computers, etc.<p>Wall Street is not just HFT.

Part of the cost of oil is based on people's projections of the price of oil in the future; if one expects oil to be much more dear in the future than it is now, one should either buy oil and consume it now or buy oil and sell it later.  Buying oil today drives up the price of oiil.<p>One plausible reason one could think that oil would be more expensive in the future is if one thinks demand will outstrip supply.  If one believes the future will hold an acceptable substitute for oil, one will be less likely to believe that future demand will exceed supply, and as a result one will believe the future price for oil will decline relative to today.  This causes one to sell oil, propagating the price fall in the oil-demand-has-fallen future into the oil-demand-has-not-fallen-yet today.  Which, at the margin, slightly delays ""the future.""<p>Or, to put it another way: the credible announcement that we're ten years away from totally solving fossil fuels would cause the present price of all of them to <i>crater</i>.",1344520987

I'm fine (and in fact, prefer) folks authoring applications specifically to the Nikon camera's interface.<p>And there's so much opportunity to extend a camera's capabilities, once it can run 3rd party applications.  Auto stitching panoramas.  Unwrapping spherical maps.  Chromakeying.  Instagram-esque filters.  Subject tracking.  Realtime preview and control over wifi and bluetooth via companion devices.  Panning motor control.  Multiple camera's automagically synchronizing.  Etc etc.<p>The author uses Parrot's Asteroid car stereo system as an example for how a non-standard usage and non-standard UI are bound to fail.  But that's a really weak comparison.  Who do you think is more likely to grow a robust 3rd party ecosystem - a one-off experiment in a crowded, cost-sensitive market (a $350 device for bleeding edge enthusiasts), or an oft-upgraded stable of professionals who are already spending multiple thousands on equipment to be more productive?<p>The alternative is Nikon creates their own OS and development environment.

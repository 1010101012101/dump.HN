In fact, when the Wii came out, most of the &#x27;Party-style&#x27; group games had a lot of couples playing. When I&#x27;ve been to the Final Fantasy Music concerts, I would say it&#x27;s at least 30-40% women. These are only my anecdotes and I don&#x27;t work in the gaming industry.&quot; - Shinkei, somebody who&#x27;s had good experiences gaming<p>&quot;[In response to the question, &#x27;Can I get my Street Fighter without sexual harrassment?&#x27;] You can&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t because they&#x27;re one and the same thing. This is a community that&#x27;s, you know, 15 or 20 years old, and the sexual harassment is part of a culture, and if you remove that from the fighting game community, it&#x27;s not the fighting game community—it&#x27;s StarCraft. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with StarCraft if you enjoy it, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with anything about eSports, but why would you want just one flavor of ice cream, you know? There&#x27;s eSports for people who like eSports, and there&#x27;s fighting games for people who like spicy food and like to have fun.

But people in video gaming communities say pretty gross things about women, and it&#x27;s been happening for a while. That particular quote is from 2012. Later in the conversation, somebody asked Aris if shouting &quot;Rape that bitch&quot; is an acceptable thing to do during a tournament. Take a moment to consider how you would answer that question.<p>Aris&#x27;s answer was &quot;Look, man. What is unacceptable about that? There&#x27;s nothing unacceptable about that. These are people, we&#x27;re in America, man, this isn&#x27;t North Korea. We can say what we want. People get emotional.&quot;<p>But hey, that&#x27;s great that your friends don&#x27;t exclude women from your groups. It&#x27;s too bad more people aren&#x27;t like you, that&#x27;s all.",1416441464

This more purely cinematic screen was, according to Eisenstein, necessary for properly showcasing the energies, conflicts, and collisions germane to the moving image arts. It would also, at least in theory, be the most accommodating frame, capable of hosting images composed for planes that were either horizontal or vertical. Eisenstein proclaimed that previous industry standards (4:3), as well as contemporaneous calls for wider screens, were nostalgic, calling forth a dated viewing regime dictated by traditional art forms.&quot;<p><a href=""https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/cinema_journal/v051/51.2.wasson01.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals...</a>",1416440663

This is essentially the scale at which the cloud becomes unstable to perturbations --- pressure is no longer able to support the cloud against gravitational oscillations.<p>The Jeans mass depends inversely on the square root of the density of the cloud.  The main problem in forming very low mass objects is that you need very large densities.  For a Jupiter mass object you need a density of ~5 x 10^4 / cm^3.  Even in molecular clouds it is difficult to achieve densities that large.  There are ways around it --- turbulence can produce small regions of very high density, for instance.

Some observations about the design of good disk-based systems:<p>- Typical inexpensive server and disk systems today are quite a bit different than even five years ago. A database internals design heuristic that would be valid several years ago no longer applies in many cases. An &quot;optimal&quot; design can vary widely due to relatively small changes to the assumed constraints.<p>- The disk bandwidth typically exceeds network bandwidth by a significant degree. Even if you are saturating the network with inserts and similar, in theory you should be able to drive that through storage if you use the available IOPS efficiently and proactively.<p>- RAM is RAM. Whether backed by disk or not, the amount of data it can hold is approximately the same. Any significant differences in what you can put in RAM between in-memory and on-disk architectures has more to do with internal implementation and design choices, it is not intrinsic.<p>- In modern database kernels, no thread is waiting for I/O operations to complete. There is also few or no tree structures, locking, secondary indexing, context switching, and similar which are frequently the source of poor throughput. It tends to be much more linear, pipelined, and parallel.<p>All of the above aside, regardless of design, a database engine only needs enough throughput to saturate the network interface under load. Once the network is saturated, nothing you do in the database engine will improve the effective throughput of the database.<p>It turns out that it is pretty straightforward to design a disk-backed database kernel that can saturate 10GbE full-duplex for a wide range of workloads. Consequently, the supposed performance benefits of in-memory are largely moot. It simplifies implementation but does not address a real performance problem on modern hardware relative to a modern database kernel design.",1416439192

At their most articulate, the GamerGate crusaders denounce progressive voices in games (whom they derisively call “S.J.W.s,” or “social justice warriors”), claiming that they have needlessly politicized what should be mere entertainment. At their least articulate, they have carried out sustained and vicious harassment of critics, prompting at least three women to flee their homes in the wake of rape and death threats.</i><p>I liked the ability of the writer to paint a picture of the games mentioned in a way that evoked at least a bit of the emotions they are intending to stimualte. However, this pargraph should&#x27;ve been left out. I am no expert on this &quot;Gamegate&quot; stuff and I can only rely on what I&#x27;ve read casually, but the media is not a court of law. The journalist does not know whether the allegations are true or not and the second part really lets her bias shine through. The actions of a few should not condemn the entire group and it&#x27;s unfortunate that some people are being uncivil in their attacks.<p>I have gamed from childhood through adulthood and never ONCE have I seen a woman be excluded from our groups or treated as inferior. In fact, when the Wii came out, most of the &#x27;Party-style&#x27; group games had a lot of couples playing. When I&#x27;ve been to the Final Fantasy Music concerts, I would say it&#x27;s at least 30-40% women. These are only my anecdotes and I don&#x27;t work in the gaming industry.<p>IMHO, a vocal minority is forming the debate and although this article should be informative, I think the journalist loses some moral authority when she reveals her bias in that paragraph.",1416438279

If everyone you know (personally or professionally) is using language X then there will be collective experience you can tap, documentation, mailing lists and howtos, lots of code already written, etc. It doesn't matter if you have a ""better"" language if there's no-one you can talk to or whose code you can reuse.<p>Remember, a programming language is not a technology.

446134,comment,445959,445959,0,0,anuraggoel,,,"I am probably just rephrasing your question. It looks like a lot of the suggested customizations (except things like ranking algorithms) can be coded on a site-wide basis and enabled/disabled on a per-user-basis by just selecting drop-down values or entering text in a box, <i>without</i> users putting a single line of code in their profiles. Just like noprocrast, topcolor etc. Additionally, a user code fragment that provides useful customization may also be useful to others (like a greasemonkey script). So, what exactly do you see a <i>code fragment</i> doing that would be unique to a user?",1232696857

Shape determines fabrication & material: Flat objects (including faceted, folded) can be best prototyped using paper/boards/sheets. Simply curved objects (cones, cylinders) aka single curvature surfacing & developables can be also done using paper. Complex forms aka double curvature requires either complex fab such as rapid prototyping, molding, pressing etc or rationalization (eg take a sphere cut it in layers, cut out flat sheets, glue, sand ie downgrade to previous option).<p>2. Drawing: You can use either a mesh 3d editor: sketchup, blender, or NURBS / subdivision surfacing: rhino, solidworks, maya (download demo where available). This is only for the intuitive part of making the form. Even though simpler I would suggest avoiding 2d apps as they tend to be tough ie misleading for physical objects (fine for plans and pcbs)<p>3. Fun: code it! You need OpenGL + you favorite language. Generate a polyhedral model, flatten it send to printer, assemble. Or just write out an STL file (super simple text format) and send it to a 3d printer (by far the easiest method for noobs).

446115,comment,446078,446078,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I think the money issue is the most pressing.  The way I see it there’s a couple problems.<p>1.  Even though feeds are fairly small and easy to serve there’s got to come a point where you have so many users that even their small feeds begin to cost significant money.  Feedburner not only has to check the host feed often but serve all the subscribers who poll as often as every 5 minutes.  That’s a lot of bandwidth and a lot of server power.<p>2.  With free analytics services all over the place it’s very unlikely you’ll be able to make money on a subscriber model which leaves ads as the only viable revenue stream.  But for that to work you need a decent ad network behind you and you can’t very well use adsense<p>With that said, I'd think it a fairly easy service to duplicate.  All Feedburner really does is read your feed and then repackage it while logging the pertinent data from the subscriber http transactions and sticking it in a database.  Since every modern language I can think of has free libraries for reading RSS/Atom feeds and logging transaction data the whole thing could probably be duplicated in a couple days.",1232695638

446113,comment,445389,445750,0,0,kailashbadu,,,"Exactly. Darfur is wretched because the government has a stake in keeping it that way. Anything that threatens to weaken their stakes will in every likelihood meet resistance from the government. Had the government’s intent been to see a thriving and safe Darfur, the crisis wouldn’t exist in the first place. It’s not surprising that any attempt to improve lives in Darfur would be frowned upon.<p>Be that as it may, it never ceases to amaze me how some nifty startups come up with innovative ideas that discreetly transform the lives of people more than what UN’s billion dollar diplomacy fails to pull off. For example the stoves that helped keep Darfur’s women safe.<p><a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/12/27/stoves.darfur/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/12/27/stoves.darfur...</a><p><a href=""http://www.darfurstoves.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.darfurstoves.org/</a>",1232695630

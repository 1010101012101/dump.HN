They collected a dataset from many web startups and can sell that data or make a nice ad based website out of it(in the TechCrunch/RWW space). It could be a profitable niche. Or it could turn into little more than a thesis paper. Of course, if it turns into a profitable niche it could always grow into something different and bigger.<p>But the technology, at least in my understanding at this point, is nothing more than running your standard regression on a proprietary dataset.",1217976978

While I doubt YouNoodle will be able to make valuable predictions, people are gullible and this tool will produce great linkbait.<p>The predictions from YouNoodle might be closer than simply picking a random number from 0-$1B, but I think a regression with a few regressors(founders previous startup success, current income, market size, etc) would be just as useful.<p>But most people don't understand statistics, and if you overestimate the valuations of new startups, that particular startup will likely link to YouNoodle.

One of the cool things about Supermemo and imitators is that there are big, maintained sets for a lot of common tasks.

In San Francisco, there has been a huge resurgence in the number of families with small children.<p>That's <i>small</i> children, not necessarily school aged children, which is why I'm still wait-and-see on this.  I attended public elementary school in SF in the 70s, which surprises a lot of the parents I meet now (I have a three year old).  I don't, unfortunately, have very encouraging things to say.  It was a rough environment.  Fights (and by that, I mean fist fights) were extremely common, even among eight year olds.  Then again, a lot of people didn't enjoy school, so I'm not necessarily saying things were all peachy in Marin or Palo Alto.<p>I have to wonder if the middle-class people will stick around once they are faced with difficult decisions about school.  San Francisco still uses a lottery to determine school assignment, while wealthy suburbs guarantee you access to the ""free"" wealthy local school.<p>I know a lot of people with three year olds, and I really like these folks, but very few of them grew up here, and I wonder how they'll react when the city tells them they've been assigned to a poorly performing school across town.  Will they accept the assignment (hard to swallow)?  Pay $17K+ for private schools (hard to do when you're struggling to make the mortgage payments)?  Or will they just move out of the city?   Keep in mind that SF is very expensive, just as pricey as these tony suburbs.<p>It could be that city centers become wealthy, safe playgrounds for singles, retirees, and young couples who stick around until their children hit school age.",1217975535

267969,comment,267813,267945,0,0,LukeG,,,"Thanks Alex. I think this latest feature is much more basic than that; we're not implementing a collaborative filtering algorithm for applicants. We let startups rate everyone who applies for their job. We think this helps, as everytime they log in, they can see who their preferred applicants are. The ""collaborative"" part of this just refers to the fact that we make it easy for multiple people on their team to rate a resume.<p>A positive side effect of this is that we get data about how good our candidates are (or how good startups think they are, which is generally what counts here). This will let us focus our very limited resources much more accurately.<p>""Empirically proven best practices"" are tough in HR, especially for small companies, because every startup has such a distinct personality. This idea of ""fit"" is huge, and it's something we're working to address, but we also think it's important for our process to be as transparent as possible in such murky territory.",1217975484

The site should then guide employers to hire using empirically proven best practices without requiring them to understand the theory behind the model or even realize that they are using one of these models. Trying to apply the the methods collaborative news filtering sites to hiring seems like a bad idea. (It sounds like you are trying to write an applicant quality predictor or something similar, unless you are just tracking the quality of applicants from different referral sources to optimize your advertising dollars.)

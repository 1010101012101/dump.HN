But it states the what the commit contains, what it solves, any caveats. Very good.<p>When I commit a transaction that contains several related changes I usually use something like (1) ABC, (2) XYX...<p>The only exception to good commit messages at one of the companies I talked about was one dev that always used one of three messages: &quot;little change&quot;, &quot;big change&quot;, &quot;major change&quot;.

Maybe the other option would be a chartered jet with in-air refueling, flying solely over international waters (or sovereign countries, like Russia and maybe China).<p>You can charter a military transport (capable of refueling) from a bunch of companies, like RUS Aviation.  Actual refueling services are harder, probably would need to be a military, although there are a few operators of contract aerial refueling service (e.g. Omega) -- unfortunately they have big military contracts, usually with the US, and thus wouldn&#x27;t be willing to participate.  You could probably take a military transport, fill it with ferry tanks, and make a decent go at it, but the problem is most of the cheap-to-charter aircraft are old inefficient aircraft like the IL-76.  I guess with new engines it wouldn&#x27;t be horrible, but something like a 737 in ferry mode would be better.  A 777-200ER or 777-200LR would probably be the best.  A 747SP is the only thing I actually know how to charter which has crazy long range (7600nm), which is almost as much as the 777-200LR (which is new, and thus highly utilized).  A 7600nm range aircraft is just enough to stay in Russian airspace and then come in through the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap, down the Atlantic, to Caracas.  The total cost of that mission would be far less than the $23mm Ecuador was willing to give up, but well in excess of $1mm.<p>A warship would probably be a lot easier, although you&#x27;d probably want to go to the Russian Far East to avoid bottlenecks -- assuming a fifth rate power like Ecuador, there could easily be &quot;this area closed due to a military exercise&quot; or other tricks to block it otherwise.",1372847655

5983564,comment,5979766,5982529,2,0,Peaker,,,"I think people tend to underestimate the amount of time they spend on problems, when those are uninteresting. A single null dereference error may be trivial to fix, but the overhead around fixing <i>any</i> bug may be costly. For example, you might need to deploy a whole new version, rerun test suites and have a bunch of meetings. Then after all of this, you might remember that the problem only costed you 10 minutes of fixing the bug.<p>When you implement a red-black-tree, do you not spend any time testing your invariants? Or figuring out the bugs? That&#x27;s a good example of where the Haskell type system can simply give you compile time guarantees saving you from bugs and from having to test them.<p>I also worry about the problems you mention, many of which Haskell indeed doesn&#x27;t help much with. I don&#x27;t see how these problems (which you solve once, usually by reusing a library) are what costs the majority of the time.  A big, non-trivial implementation has bugs and will require testing.  Haskell will have less bugs, and require less tests.  This is a pretty big deal.<p>It&#x27;s weird that you bring Twitter as an example, as they canned a dynamic language solution for a static language that is in many ways very similar to Haskell.<p>I&#x27;ve seen multiple large scale projects in dynamic languages. They all fail to scale well, both performance-wise and maintenance-wise.  Statically-typed systems scale far better along both of these axis.",1372847556

Marketing and business persons did this. If you have followed the story, there were posts describing how actual developer googlers used and loved Reader, and even tried to save it.<p>><i>It seems like you think it&#x27;s &quot;the web&quot;  thus search, RSS, and I don&#x27;t know what else you&#x27;d include  and they think it&#x27;s &quot;hacking&quot;, i.e. making things that were not previously known to be possible, e.g. a web search engine that automatically finds the useful sites, an email system with a hundred times as much storage as any other webmail system, a draggable and zoomable world map in a browser, gigabit fiber to the home, robot cars, a free-software smartphone, groupware that replaces chat and email, JavaScript that runs fast, balloon internet, scanning the books of the libraries of the world, an easy-to-use system for writing fault-tolerant massively-parallel programs, mass-market lifelogging, stuff like that</i><p>Seems like you bought hook line and sinker the BS PR copy they give.<p>For one, their core business is ads. Not search itself, not Android (a loss leader) and surely not flying robot cars.<p>Second, nothing &quot;hackish&quot; or &quot;impossible&quot; about most of which you describe.<p>Only the &quot;web search engine that automatically finds the useful sites&quot; fits the profile --and that&#x27;s based on that Stanford research the founders did, not Google work. If anything, it deteriorated over time, with BS non results and meddling with it to promote ads and/or G+.<p>And even that was hardly impossible. The Chinese search engine Baidu is based on similar tech, which was also created in the US, independently of Google, around the same time (even actually predating PageRank (it&#x27;s even mentioned in Google&#x27;s US patents).<p>An &quot;an email system with a hundred times as much storage as any other webmail system&quot; was just a matter of resources and monetizing, not some special technology.<p>A &quot;a draggable and zoomable world map in a browser&quot; was bought from another company.<p>&quot;gigabit fiber to the home&quot; is offered in many parts of the world. That the US lacks in this area, is not something<p>&quot;a free-software smartphone&quot; -- what&#x27;s innovative about it? They make money from ads. They give the software for free (especially since it was based on Linux and a modified Java SDK). And it&#x27;s not like they made a killing off of it -- Samsung did.<p>&quot;JavaScript that runs fast&quot; -- Safari did that first (they released it to the public at the same time --Sep 2008--, but Safari as a stable version, Google as a beta of Chrome).<p>&quot;an easy-to-use system for writing fault-tolerant massively-parallel programs&quot; What&#x27;s that? Go? Because you make it sound like the created Erlang.<p>Etc. The rest are &quot;robot cars&quot; and &quot;google glass&quot; -- mainly half-baked prototypes, that tons of other companies would have put out if they a) have the money, b) liked to show half-baked stuff years ahead of any release date.<p>And &quot;baloon internet&quot;.

Reader didn&#x27;t take off because most people didn&#x27;t use it.</i><p>As someone who never used Google Reader and therefore doesn&#x27;t really care either way about it, I can live with that, because the article raises points that strike me as <i>generally</i> true, and are discussed to rarely for my taste.<p>> <i>Most people found it too hard and found Facebook + Twitter way easier</i><p>You said this about Google Reader, but I&#x27;d like to take it out of context and go on a tangent (because when all you have is an off-road bike, everything looks like a ramp :D)<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone denies that literacy is really important, some would call it a human right, or at least something deriving from human rights. But what would constitute &quot;literacy in the information age&quot;? Or maybe even &quot;just&quot; &quot;web literacy&quot;?<p>Being able to sign up to Facebook? Being able to write HTML and CSS? Being able to code a little, enough to be able to discern cool projects from total charlatans? Being able to code well enough to do anything they could possibly want their computer to do, and to contribute to the pool from which they took in however small ways?<p>I don&#x27;t know where to exactly draw the line, but I am positive that signing up for Facebook is not enough (regardless of what Facebook might tell people, duh). It&#x27;s easy, but it leads nowhere, or not very far. It is akin to having someone read and write <i>for</i> you, instead of ever learning it. Perfectly acceptable in the short run, when there is no other choice, but pathetic, a complete no-no, in the long run.<p>Our society would be even more of a cold, dark cellar without widespread literacy. Not that everyone reads, but most people at least could if they wanted to, sometimes they do when it&#x27;s necessary, and that helps. With that in mind, I worry about how naively we treat this brave new computerized world.<p>There is this quote that predates the web but which the web constantly makes me think of, and which I believe goes hand in hand with another one:<p>&quot;<i>Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one.</i>&quot; -- A. J. Liebling\n&quot;Do you belong in journalism?&quot;, The New Yorker (14 May 1960)<p>&quot;<i>If people cannot write well, they cannot think well, and if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them.</i>&quot; -- George Orwell<p>Yes, not being able to think is easier. I know, I&#x27;ve been there. But only in the short run, in the long run it makes everything impossibly hard.<p>The web as we know it, isn&#x27;t even two decades old, and we already act all wise about it, that &quot;that&#x27;s just how it is&quot;. Yet we didn&#x27;t give up on literacy for hundreds of years, if not millenia. If anyone today suggested that hey, wouldn&#x27;t it be <i>kinda okay</i> if most people couldn&#x27;t read, as long as the others made sure they select the best books to read to them from...? they&#x27;d be laughed out of any group of people. Most people on the planet older than 10 would see through that. It took us so long to get here, but damnit, here we are.<p>I don&#x27;t see how computers are different, other than currently being mostly pushed and therefore being held hostage by motives of greed, consumerism and distraction, and our own shallow desire for instant gratification. But those motives are like clouds in the wind, in the way they are manifested they&#x27;re rather a zit that grew in an unclean spot, than a &quot;law of nature&quot;... while computation and communication are hard facts that will not go anywhere ever, until the very end of the universe, or at least the end of life in it.<p>Whoever obstructed literacy in history is now dust and their motives forgotten, whatever temporary advantage over others it gained them they lost - but literacy remains, and the gratitude to those who teached others with patience and creativity will never waver or diminish. Again, I don&#x27;t see how computers are different. Not everybody is Shakespeare, and not everybody has to be Carmack, but that doesn&#x27;t mean to just leave it to the &quot;experts&quot;.<p>Kicking out the ladder under you and being the middleman for what you found in the tree is a game old as dirt, and I think one nice step to help improving the physical world would be to stop repeating its worst mistakes in the &quot;virtual&quot; one.<p>/end rant..  no, wait:<p><i>A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.

It&#x27;s funny, because instead of building better relations with our neighbors &quot;we&quot; are constantly trying to please the US. This trend continues despite being given nothing but empty promises for years. So yeah, our gov likes to think and say (loudly) that those relations are pretty good -- hard to say if it&#x27;s because they want to keep their face or for whatever reason. I think that US also likes this arrangement a lot, because free service can&#x27;t be bad [3].<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/sikorskiradek/status/351959186072027139"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/sikorskiradek/status/351959186072027139</a> [polish]<p>[2] <a href=""https://twitter.com/sikorskiradek/status/352062021082165249"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/sikorskiradek/status/352062021082165249</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://rt.com/news/poland-drops-charges-investigation-136/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rt.com/news/poland-drops-charges-investigation-136/</a>",1372845836

If he can then it means he's taking an open source project and doing something with it to make money.  It doesn't even sound like he's closing the source of his fork (assuming he would even have this option).  It's not the most efficient thing but if he really can make money with this I don't see much fault in it.

Would your company be willing to demote you, or let you work on some of the code in the projects you are developing?<p>2) Coding is boring drudgery and you have less of a view of where you are going than the managers (we hope :-) You'll be stuck with bad colleagues bringing you down instead of being able to get rid of the dead weight. You'll be out of practice and not experienced in a lot of new things, but it sounds like you already put ten years in coding so you will be able to catch up.<p>3) What you said here made sense. You could also sell yourself as a ""fixer"", who has both the programming skill and the management nouse to get stuck projects going again. Another alternative is to go into consulting, but I'm guessing neither of these options appeal if you just want to go back to coding. You could try cutting your hours and work on open source the rest of the time in order to improve your CV. Hell, your company might let you work one day a week on open source a la Google if you pitch it right (like, I'm good and I'm quitting if you don't give me this.)",1283337764

Our website and email was down for 24 hours. They enabled the VPS the next day for us to look at it. What's worse I was asked to reinstall the VPS and it took me some convincing for them to enable it so I get my data from the server.<p>Lesson learned? I think you should never have any operations where you don't have full control. This still holds true but it was a bit ironic because to have full control I ran everything on the VPS, effectively transferring full control to the VPS provider! It was the single point of failure.<p>Now I will transfer each different service to a different provider. Email to rackspace, websites to a host, git services to github and so on.",1283336952

1652354,comment,1651869,1652119,0,0,mrtron,,,"Very close.  From what he later posts about supervisord monitoring - he is basically hitting a server bottleneck of number of threads, which causes him to run out of memory and get into swap space.  Then everything goes to hell and he (supervisord) has to restart.<p>Proof:  You will have 0 memory free and start using swap when the restart happens - type 'top' and watch this go down.<p>Fix:  Use less threads.  The number of concurrent users you can support is the # of pages you can serve up per second in each thread times the number of threads your server can handle.  So a huge improvement can be caching.  Cache pages, blocks, hell maybe your whole site.  The cache hits will serve 10-100 times more responses per second than generating your entire page.<p>I consulted on a project that was having horrible server performance on a huge server with relatively static data.  The way they produced pages was really poor and took 3 or 4 seconds.  There is no way you can serve up a large number of concurrent requests with the turnaround time over a second.  I added caching as a quick fix and they ended up just being happy that 99.9% of their pages served up in 1/100th of a second.",1283336517

Personally, I don't see a reason why you can't pander to both managers and developers. Yes, you've got some added expenses, but certainly less than most business-centric marketing campaigns or new yachts for Larry.<p>Having said that, I don't think Oracle was totally neglecting that area. They had a few decent free tools available (SQLDeveloper, JDeveloper, trial DB versions) and while their articles didn't come close to the sheer amount IBM offered, there was enough information out there.<p>They could've marketed that better, though. But in that regard, they're certainly not much worse than a lot of other enterprise companies. You can't measure everything by the way Microsoft and Apple are doing it.",1283336429

From a purely logical point of view sure, he should have opted for auto-renew or at the least noticed the expiration mail. However, that's precisely the argument in the article, Google is logical and lacks a human point of view.<p>Consider:<p>1) Google only sent one renewal notification email for what is obviously a critical service.<p>2) Some people distrust auto-renewing subscriptions (like me). I've used services that didn't realize my credit card was going to expire and gave me no warning before they cut me off. I'd rather receive a clear and concise notice email.<p>Human things Google could have done:<p>1) Sent a 1 month, 1 week and 24 hour notice.<p>2) Put a renewal notification in the Gmail UI. There is a system for this already to occasionally confirm your alternate email address etc.<p>3) Give a 7 day grace period after your subscription expires.<p>4) Respond with a transient full inbox failure, instead of a permanent failure which cause all sorts of havoc.<p>5) Put an explanation next to auto-renew option saying they will send you a email notices if your credit card might expire.<p>The OP in this case is somewhat technical and should have known better, but if this had happened to my mom, my grandparents or my girlfriend then I would say the blame falls squarely with Google for lack of UX due diligence.",1283335810

Also, the dollar was falling during the design phase. So the actual production cost came to $188, and the price to governments in quantity 10K was $189. More than 2 million have been sold, delivered, and put into the hands of students all over the world. (Later designs cost less, and we have every confidence in reaching the $100 price point due to the inexorable working of Moore's Law.) You can buy one on eBay for about $150. I own two, which I have named thing1 and thing2.<p>The $10 PC from India was a publicity stunt, not a PC, and never went into production.<p>The Raspberry Pi is $25, needing in addition a keyboard, display, external storage, and networking. That should come to about $150-$200.

The Highlander TV series also liberally used some of the songs, most prominently the album recording of the title song ""Princes of the Universe"" as the theme song, but also variations on ""Who Wants To Live Forever"" in the score.<p>There's no question Queen was a fully-sold-out pop band at the end.

This means that 87% of American adults lack the minimum level of literacy skill necessary to complete simple tasks like comparing the viewpoints in two editorials or computing the cost per ounce of food items. In other words, the overwhelming majority of Americans lack the minimimum amount of education required to participate in the knowledge economy or to contribute anything meaningful to the democratic process. Source: Table 1 on p. 3, Figure 2 on p. 4.\nAdults <i>unable</i> to read prose at a 'proficient' level, by race/ethnicity: White - 83%, Asian/Pacific Islander - 88%, Hispanic - 96%, Black - 98%.<p>Adults <i>unable</i> to read prose at a 'proficient' level, by educational attainment: High school graduates - 96%, College graduates - 69%, Graduate studies/degrees - 59%. In other words, the majority of graduate students are incapable of fully understanding a newspaper, let alone an academic journal article. And virtually all high school graduates are functionally illiterate. (And again, being 'proficient' does not mean being able to read academic journal articles, which is sort of the minimum requirement for being an independent thinker in society. In fact at least 2 / 3rds of those who score 'proficient' still do not possess this more advanced measure of literacy.)<p>John Taylor Gatto also gives his analysis of the situation here based on the 1992 data. (The data I cited was 2003)<p><a href=""http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/3b.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/3b.htm</a><p><a href=""http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/3j.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/3j.htm</a><p>Gatto throws in a couple weasel words, and I think sometimes his analysis is a bit reaching, but overall it seems to be generally accurate. Even if you don't fully buy into the idea of an enormous decline over the last 100 years, the current methodology of the National Adult Literacy Survey seems pretty solid. (That's currently the gold standard for literacy estimates in the US.)<p>But what about the CIA World Factbook, which estimates that the United States has a 97% literacy rate as of 2002? Where do these figures come from? To quote from Jonathan Kozol's book Illiterate in America, ""For one hundred years, starting in 1840, the census posed the question of the population's literacy level in its ten-year compilations. The government removed this question from its survey in the 1940 census. The reason, according to a U.S. Census Bureau publication, was a general conviction that 'most people [by this time] could read and write ...'<p>In 1970, pressured by the military, the Bureau of the Census agreed to reinstate the literacy question. Even then, instead of posing questions about actual skills, the census simply asked adults how many years of school they had attended. More than 5 percent of those the census reached replied that they had had less than a fifth grade education. For no known reason, the government assumed that four fifths of these people probably could read and, on this dangerous assumption, it was publicly announced that 99 percent of all American adults could read and write. These are the figures which the U.S. government passed on to the United Nations for the purposes of worldwide compilations and comparisons."" You can read the rest of chapter 5 here, which further explains the methodology and how the CIA figures are propaganda rather than science:<p><a href=""http://eserver.org/courses/spring97/76100o/readings/kozol.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eserver.org/courses/spring97/76100o/readings/kozol.ht...</a>",1315194752

In the highest levels, you can't really fight a straight up battle and hope to win, it's a game of getting little advantages (like removing %1 of his income) and trying to get ahead, and push those advantages much later on.

Unlike Warcraft3 or other RTS, units in SC have very low health. Even if you have 5% more units, you can easily lose a fight within seconds from bad unit control, bad fighting position or just bad luck. It's never a good idea to attack just because you have 5% more units. Good players will continue play cautiously to make sure the opponent never gets a chance to take those 5% back. In the end, they win by the accumulated bits of advantages from various battles or economy advantages. You don't always need an glorious ""final battle"" to win the game, as long as your advantage is big enough (say 50%), you opponent will know that he lost and leave the game.<p>This is probably why SC has become very popular and still remains very popular. There are constant conflicts throughout the game trying to increase or take back the small advantages.",1315194562

It is probably the most important strategic lesson in the game: if you have a temporary 5 pct material advantage, you can still easily get outplayed if you force a fight.  Better to turn that into a 10 pct material advantage, etc, and force a fight only after you've already won.<p>The other game I play a lot of is League of Legends, and sadly the community around my skill level has not learned this gospel yet.  If it looks like we have 30 seconds of advantage, the team of 5 almost invariably either does nothing or goes for a decapitating stroke whose downside risk is loss.  A better tactic is probably ""Get more ahead so we win the next skirmish, too, snowballing until we win by concession or overwhelming force.""",1315192996

Americans can never ever achieve any real scientific literacy at their current reading literacy levels. It's flat out impossible, and the fact that the authors of this article are complaining about scientific literacy out of context shows you that they don't know shit about the causes of the various problems within our schools.<p>Hell, roughly half of American adults are so illiterate that they can't even read the one sentence instructions on their medications. That's why you have stuff happening all the time like this:<p>""A two-year-old is diagnosed with an inner ear infection and prescribed an antibiotic. Her mother understands that her daughter should take the pre- scribed medication twice a day. After carefully studying the label on the bottle and deciding that it doesn’t tell how to take the medicine, she fills a teaspoon and pours the antibiotic into her daughter’s painful ear.""<p>To quote the most recent report on health literacy, ""90 million adults with limited health literacy cannot fully benefit from much that the health and health-care system have to offer.""<p>Despite all the media jokes about people researching their own diseases, the fact is that only roughly 10% of American adults are even literate enough to read popular articles about medicine, and only ~3% are able to actually understand the academic literature. When they say that 90 million adults can't participate in the medical system, they aren't talking about adults who can't research their own symptoms and medications and help the doctor on collaborating on a diagnosis and treatment; rather, they're talking about people who literally can't even do what their doctors tell them to do. Roughly 25% of all doctors visits result in the patient not doing what the doctor tells them to do, and a large percentage of the time it's because they literally can't understand the simple instructions the doctor is giving. We spend roughly 1.2 trillion per year on the health system, which means that up to (but probably significantly less than) 300B of that is going right out the window due to poor adherence, especially since those with low adherence have good outcomes roughly 26% less of the time than those with high adherence, so they end up costing a lot more money in the longrun. I forget what percentage of low adherence is due to literacy/education, but I know that it is one of the largest factors.<p>The fucked up thing is that ""among those scoring in the lowest level on the prose literacy scale [1st-ish grade level], only 29 percent reported they did not read well and only 34 percent reported they did not write well. The majority of those performing at this level perceive their reading and writing skills to be adequate. Among those in the next highest level [4th-ish grade level] the results were even more surprising, as only 3 percent said they couldn’t read well and 6 percent said they couldn’t write well (Kirsch et al., 1993; see Chapter 2 for more information on the NALS).""<p>If you ever actually go into a real science classroom you'll see that if the teacher actually tried to teach science it would be a complete waste of time. Virtually none of the kids would actually be able to understand any of the lessons, let alone transfer them to real life situations. And while it's true science textbooks and the way science is taught is terrible, the vast majority of students aren't going to become scientifically literate no matter how you try to teach it.",1315192208

It's also likely that these patents also apply to the later OpenType format, which was derived from TrueType.<p>The cause of ""fuzzy fonts"" complaints in Windows is ClearType, which is a implementation of sub-pixel rendering, which is rather different from the broader concept of hinting.<p>The Sharp Fonts website seems to be simply about installing Microsoft's Webfonts on Linux, although it does mention the issue of them looking poor if BCI is disabled in FreeType due to these now-expired patents.",1270331987

Is it used in a narrow, specialized domain or broadly? To what extent are the advantages of FP in this domain realizable in others? Is FP only suitable for small, elite teams or can mainstream programmers pick it up with the right training?

Having two parents who got disease at a young age is not great for a variety of reasons.<p>If the Chordoma Foundation or someone else could yield a breakthrough in treatment -- a real possibility -- my whole situation changes. For me, possibly more than for most people, this makes my argument stronger. They've been in operation for three years and already a lot has been learned. (More than in the past 20 years!) Consequently, I think the equation reduces to me getting to the bad point in sickness within three-to-five years, or them getting successful before then.<p>(Ignoring the very high probability of recurrence, I am perfectly healthy and have been since my surgery five years ago.

Smiling for you baseball photo is not necessarily indicative of smiling in general. Perhaps. But it's quite possible that the players who smiled for their photo were already well-established, could afford to seem less professional, etc. And if they were more successful by the time of that photo, then perhaps their careers on average were more successful, and hence they had easier, more-stress free and perhaps longer lives.<p>Or to continue the success-at-time-of-photo idea, maybe they smiled because the photographer smiled at them more, because the photographer was more familiar with them. Could by any number of reasons that the two things were correlated, all of which wouldn't necessarily imply that if you, reader, smile more, then you, reader, will live longer.<p>Though that's probably true. But yeah, easy to forget that a smile itself is very much an effect of something else. Concluding that if you 'smile more', something good will happen is sort of a false optimization.

It may be that they do but I wouldn't be surprised if we find that the kinds of errors they minimize aren't the kind that often impede development in practice and that the strictures of FP languages, particularly lazy ones, make some common programming tasks significantly more difficult.<p>People also like to claim that functional languages are particularly well suited for concurrent programming, but, as Simon Peyton Jones has himself said, just getting rid of mutable state doesn't automatically make your code parallelizable.<p>People used to hold up Darcs as a Haskell success story but as far as I can tell people have hacked together DVCS systems in ""inferior"" languages like C and Python that are at least as robust and featureful.",1270328803

They couldn't even be sure Unicode was going to win.<p>Besides, the <i>whole point</i> of wchar_t is to not be variable width. UTF-16 in wchar_t is an abomination that dates back to the industry building APIs that take UCS-2 (which the author really ought to cover) before they realized UCS-2 was too narrow to do its job. So now we have a lot of code that appears to support Unicode but may not handle it correctly, depending on whether QA knew they should try surrogate pairs. Almost nobody realizes UTF-16 needs to be searched and spliced as carefully as UTF-8. Each is just a compression scheme for the million or so actual codepoints, and there aren't many reasons to favor one over the other (in memory, at least).<p>What's the actual problem here, the team made assumptions that ANSI warned against making? Apple failed to accept UCS-4 for their API?",1270328565

A middle ground between never dating and putting Ms. X through the pain of your illness.<p>That middle ground is this.  Go date.  Go have that relationship.  It will probably end on it's own in a few months, as most relationships do.  In case it doesn't end on it's own, you have the fallback plan of ending it if you get sick.  Just slip into asshole mode, when you get sick, and if she doesn't end it, then you end it.  Tell her you want to see other people, etc.  That will hurt her, of course, but so what?  If she wasn't dating you, she'd be dating somebody else, who, statistically speaking, would also end the relationship, and would also cause her that breakup pain that we all feel more times than we would like to.  So she's not getting more pain, just the same pain everybody else gets.<p>Once you make up your mind that you will proceed on that course of action, you can go ahead and enter a relationship with no worries.  Nine times out of ten, all this soul searching will have been for not, because most relationships end, and they all end painfully.  On that 10th time, you have a plan to avoid inflicting any extra pain, by making it look just like the other nine times.<p>If they almost all end painfully, why get into relationships at all?  Because it's worth it.  In almost all cases, the area under the joy curve is greater than the area under the pain curve.",1270328549

We should play to the strengths of our language and our community.<p>It's easy to agree that there's lots of software floating around, but that not a lot of it is good.  That's particularly true about enterprise software (I used to work in the field).  It doesn't have to be good.  You could have an excessively complicated UI and do your numerics in Python (for the love of God, numerics and statistics in Python?) and people will still use it.  The damn app can take 12 seconds to load, and people will still use it.  How are you going to sell Haskell to the enterprise community when that's their bar?<p>If people want to write code in Haskell for a living, if they're serious about this freeing-software-from-the-von-Neumann-paradigm thing, they should seek out problem spaces where software quality matters.  This is hardly the sole core competency of Haskell, IMO.  When one of my friends was introduced to it, he noted that it was a very ""scientific"" language.  Which is to say, he thought it was impractical for regular software.  The flip side to this is that we can very easily do things like check for gene sequences in Haskell (Brian O'Sullivan was doing something like this).<p>The fact that things like sets and maps are treated like values means that they are very natural and easy to work with (albeit a little slower than their mutable counterparts in other languages), so why aren't we seeing Haskell used to analyze social networks?  Haskell is a powerful language.  We just need to see it for what we <i>could</i> do with it, rather than redoing the old things that have already been done.",1270328401

I felt the code ""was"" the tests since my erlang code was concrete and well guarded.  I never had any surprises between test and production.<p>This is not to bash the value of scripting languages.

My (canadian) wife and I moved from Amsterdam to Toronto last year in may. I'm a permanent resident now.<p>Family class is by far the easiest way. We did the paperwork ourselves without help from a lawyer. We simply did research online and listened to people who had gone through the same procedure.<p>I think the time between the first paperwork and me getting on the plane was about 10 months. We made one mistake on the forms which probably delayed the process by a month.<p>In Holland I was self employed and I'm doing the same here in Toronto.

440106,comment,439302,439302,0,0,vchakra,,,"I think you need to do a little bit more research before picking one of the above. Rather than pick one now, it would be better to spend a little bit of time building up some sort of a business plan (not something to show VC's but just for internal clarity).<p>Of the three, the 3rd option seems to make most sense to me. The things one would look for are:\n1. Customer pain point. Of the three, the third is the most clear. For the other two, its not clear as to who the customer is, or even what pain point you are solving.\n2. Your capability to compete (niche markets would be better). 1 and 3 seem better than 2 in this regard..\n3. Cash flow/bootstrap options: 2 and 3 seem to be better, although you may end up paying for agents sitting on the bench before business builds up. 1 is the least attractive since its unclear who will pay for this initially.\n4. Competition -- 1 has the least, 2 the most. However it might be better to have some competition, since (often) lack of any competition indicates lack of a market.<p>Just thoughts off the top of my head..",1232343106

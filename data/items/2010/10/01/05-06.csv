1746175,comment,1746081,1746081,0,0,grovulent,,,"The layers of irony in this discussion are quite astonishing.<p>The reason, I take it, that some are concerned that a comment about masturbation appeared on HN is that it is a signal that the quality of discussion on HN is in decline and that it's audience is gradually shifting over to the mindless hordes of Reddit and Digg.<p>Now presumably,by quality, we mean things like ability to propose a well thought out point of view and defend such a view with rational argument and sourced evidence.<p>But notice - what they are focusing on is a signal that quality is declining.  And treating the comment as a signal is as far as they seem to take it.  There doesn't seem to be much effort taken to get to know the person who made the comment, to investigate the degree of contribution made before.<p>Hence the irony.  There is sophisticated discourse, and there are ""signals"" of sophisticated discourse.  At some point, if you really want to participate in an extended sophisticated discourse, one that is really capable of going beyond group think and shallow mindedness, your first impressions and understanding of what the surface implies about what lies below need to be bracketed and put out of play.  (After all, superficiality knows only how to reflect itself when it stares into deep waters).<p>The irony goes both ways however.  In a group of highly sophisticated thinkers, and I've been around a few - I'm particularly attracted to the ones mouthing off all sorts of low brow and inappropriate things.  For these are the ones I tend to think have a greater propensity for independent thinking.  Quite often the signals are right - but eventually, if you want to get to know them, you have to put them out of play.<p>Having said all this - the hordes of Reddit and the rest will likely respond to the low brow signals as most people do - and will be attracted to them because of it.  If you don't want them here - don't signal to them that they will likely fit in.",1285912694

1746154,comment,1744417,1744417,0,0,kragen,,,"It seems to me that there are two or three things being conflated here under the ""NoSQL"" moniker, and Stonebraker isn't helping things.<p>First, there's the standard relational storage model.  We've known for almost 40 years that some kinds of queries are a lot faster if you denormalize so you're not even in 1NF. Occasionally this matters. ""Document stores"" are a lot better suited to things that aren't in 1NF than relational databases. In theory you could maybe make this problem go away by throwing more hardware at the problem, so that the extra factor of lg N (which might be around 20 or so) goes away.<p>Second, there's SQL and all of the hassles it comes with, which can be largely papered over by things like SQLAlchemy and Django and the like, but there are still tricky issues like schema migration and incremental rollout.<p>Third, there's the CAP theorem. ACID requires consistency (the C in ACID and the C in CAP are the same), so you give up either availability or partitionability, and when you give up partitionability you're usually giving up parallelizability as well, which can put a crimp in the ""throw hardware at the problem"" approach.<p>It's true that the costs of abandoning standard SQL databases are high. But there are things you can't get any other way. If you need a million queries per second per database server (serving up variable-length lists of structured data), if you need to be able to incrementally roll out a new database schema across your site, or if you need to tolerate network partitions (and latency; a partitioned network is just the limiting case of high latency) without your database becoming unavailable, standard SQL databases aren't going to give you what you need, as far as I know.<p>As far as I can tell, these are the three sources of ""NoSQL"": rejecting the relational model as a way to organize on-disk storage, rejecting the SQL DDL as a way to manage change, and rejecting ACID transactions.  Interestingly, none of these necessarily implies rejecting SQL as a user-interface language, and indeed FQL is an SQL user interface on top of some very non-SQL-ish systems.<p>(SQL itself is a terrible language, as Stonebraker will no doubt tell you if you ask, but it's not so terrible as to justify the switching costs.)",1285912065

There were warts for sure, but the biggest one was the pace of development and the outdatedness of the blog posts.<p>By now, however, it feels like all this complaining has put Bundler through a kind of crucible that RubyGems never had.  From my perspective Bundler 1.0.0 is a pure joy to work with.  The problems it solves were very real, and from where I sit it solves them in a very thorough way.  At the moment I'm contemplating how to bring my 50k line 3-year-old Rails app up to Rails 3, and converting to Bundler is the first step with immediate and significant benefits.  I lump Bundler in with efforts like RVM and Rubinius, as ambitious projects that are pushing the state of Ruby forward and keeping it relevant in a world of Clojures, Scalas and node.jses",1285910677

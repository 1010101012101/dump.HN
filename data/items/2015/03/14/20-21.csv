I learned BASIC and assembler programming on the Spectrum and it occupies a special place in my heart.<p>My mother told me recently that I used to ask her to read out the code from magazines while I would type them in to the spectrum.<p>I have a vivid memory of typing in long strings of hex from magazines to create graphics programs - kind of proto-photoshop things.

Lack of information about the SSL negotiation in the http context.

9204122,comment,9202039,9202314,0,0,cbd1984,,,"> C is the wrong language to dynamically allocate everything. The probability to forget to free it, including in every error path, is much higher in my eyes.<p>There&#x27;s a trick you can use to make remembering to free it more likely. Some people call it &quot;RAII in C&quot;, I like to think of it as &quot;nested allocations and errors&quot;: When you allocate something, or do something else which one, can fail, and two, must be undone (freed, closed, etc.), do the allocation and deallocation in properly nested pairs, and use gotos to jump to the code which undoes the last successful allocation if some allocation goes wrong. Basically, you arrange your code in a stack, where the most recent successful allocation is undone first, so you can neatly jump down to the code which undoes all successful allocations and doesn&#x27;t try to undo the unsuccessful ones.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>    int foo(void)\n    {\n        int ret = 0; /* Variable we return to indicate\n                        success or failure. Defaults to 0,\n                        which is success. */\n\n        FILE *inf;\n        FILE *outf;\n\n        if ((inf = fopen(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;)) == NULL) {\n            ret = -1;\n            goto inf_fail;\n        }\n\n        if ((outf = fopen(&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;)) == NULL) {\n            ret = -2;\n            goto outf_fail;\n        }\n\n        /* Do the actual work, now that you know you have\n           all the resources you need. */\n\n        fclose(outf);\n\n        outf_fail:\n        fclose(inf); /* If we jump here, we know we\n                        successfully opened inf,\n                        but not outf. */\n\n        inf_fail: /* If we jump here, we didn&#x27;t actually\n                     open squat, so all we can do is return\n                     the status variable we set above. */\n        return ret;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nC++ does basically this automatically, which is called RAII, but in C you have to do it by hand.",1426366523

We now do things like <a href=""http://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~uday/publications/pluto+.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~uday/publications/pluto+.pdf</a>\n</i><p>Thanks, I&#x27;ll read this over.<p><i>In fact, moving platforms now makes little performance difference.</i><p>Interestingly, we are saying the same thing but coming to opposite conclusions.   I agree that compiler generated code produces approximately the same performance on Sandy Bridge vs Haswell.  But I also know that the performance potential on Haswell can be much higher than that of Sandy Bridge, thus see this as a drop in compiler performance.  Whereas you seem to be concluding that because the compiler achieves comparable performance, there has been little hardware improvement across generations.<p><i>We decided we care more about compile speed than doing stuff like this.</i><p>I&#x27;ve never really understood the emphasis on compile speed --- it seems misguided.  Sure, you don&#x27;t want to wait for the compiler to slowly redo the same suboptimal &quot;optimization&quot; on every recompilation, but shouldn&#x27;t there be some way to cache the previous &quot;best&quot; so you can start from there?   And wouldn&#x27;t it be more efficient if there was some way that you could specify to the compiler where you want it to spend its time, maybe even offline so it won&#x27;t hold up everything else?  Not just the spectrum from &quot;don&#x27;t optimize and while you are at it please pass all function variables on the stack&quot; to &quot;do the best you can as long as it doesn&#x27;t take longer than a millisecond&quot;, but &quot;do what it takes and I&#x27;ll tell you when it&#x27;s good enough&quot;?[1]<p><i>It&#x27;s almost certainly just a small bug or tweak somewhere.</i><p>Perhaps I can try to send you an example the next time I come across a compact example.   I&#x27;m dubious that increasing the automatization is the right approach --- what I think I want is easier access to &quot;manual mode&quot;.  And I&#x27;m equally dubious that it&#x27;s going to be an easy fix, but would be wonderful it it was.<p>As a quick example of the sort of issue, Haswell allows two 32B loads and one 32B store per cycle, and has three address generation ports to support this.  Two of the AGP&#x27;s can be used for stores or loads, and one (Port 7) is only for stores.  But Port 7 can only generate &quot;simple&quot; addresses --- fixed offsets from a register.<p>I&#x27;ve yet to find a way to convince a compiler to generate two loads and a store that can be executed in a single cycle without resorting to assembly. Effectively, the cost of an instruction varies depending on what other instructions are executed the same cycle. They can&#x27;t be scored independently, and the compiler gets stuck in a &quot;local optimum&quot; rather than finding the &quot;global optimum&quot;.<p>Just the ability to say &quot;No, really, I want both of these to be loop variables, and this one to be incremented, and this one to be decremented, and I want the loop to terminate when the decrement hits zero&quot; would be tremendous.  Or a least, I&#x27;d like to be able to specify this as a starting point for optimization, and have some guarantee that the compiler won&#x27;t &quot;simplify&quot; by combining the registers unless the &quot;simplification&quot; actually has better performance.<p>[1] I feel like Dan Luu&#x27;s excellent and under-discussed article on Software Testing is very applicable here: <a href=""http://danluu.com/testing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danluu.com/testing/</a>\nLike software testing, compilers seem to have settled into the strange expectation that they should do the same thing over and over again very quickly, rather than doing something once and well.",1426365007

Realizing that someone has to read your code -- even if that someone is mostly just <i>you</i> -- requires a modicum of empathy...and more often than not, this aids in the design process.<p>A common complaint about learning via something like Codecademy is that you might learn the syntax and how to solve problems...but you don&#x27;t get much guidance on how to apply that knowledge to real projects.

9204003,comment,9202600,9202600,0,0,hlandau,,,"There are a few issues here.<p>SDO, CSDE: Firstly, some platforms are too short to fit all of the doors on, especially with the lengths of trains being extended. Thus at some platforms it is necessary to ensure that the first or last doors of the train, or both, are not unlocked.<p>The London Underground has its own system to do this (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Door_Operation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Door_Operation</a> ). Here it appears they decided to use GPS, but the LU almost certainly uses a much simpler (and more reliable system).<p>Of course, if a GPS fix isn&#x27;t obtained, you don&#x27;t know whether you&#x27;re at a short platform or not, so you can&#x27;t assume anything.<p>A related safety issue is whether drivers open the doors on the right side of the train (!). Yes, believe it or not, they sometimes get this wrong. When the London Underground moved to one-man train operation (meaning that the doors were controlled by the driver, rather than by a separate guard), they had some issues with this happening. They responded by introducing a simple, low-level system called &quot;Correct Side Door Enable&quot;, which uses an electrical loop by the side of the track in platforms, which is detected by the train and allows the train to determine that a) it is in a station and b) which side the platform is on. This prevents the driver from opening the doors in error.<p>You can find some information on CSDE here: <a href=""http://www.trainweb.org/districtdave/html/correct_side_door_enable.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trainweb.org/districtdave/html/correct_side_door_...</a><p>I would guess that the LU&#x27;s SDO system uses some similar or even interrelated mechanism.<p>Metro vs. Rail: Note that on metro trains (e.g. the majority of London Underground trains) the doors usually open automatically, whereas on other trains you have to press a button to open the doors once it illuminates. This makes the potential consequences of accidentally opening the doors on the wrong side worse on tube trains, especially when you consider how packed they can get. Whereas with a train like the class 377, a driver would have to unlock the door on the wrong side and then the passenger would have to accidentally open the door on the wrong side. So the consequences of accidentally unlocking the doors on the wrong side is not -that- severe, which makes the apparent difficulty and obscurity of the overrides available to the driver (plus the implication that the drivers aren&#x27;t properly trained on their operation) all the more ridiculous.<p>(A particularly curious variant is found on some trains of the Paris metro; the doors try and open as soon as the driver tells them to, but a mechanical latch on the doors prevents it. A passenger has to move up the latch before the doors can open. The latches were probably retrofitted, perhaps to mitigate unnecessary heat loss, but it also serves as a safety measure. This system has the advantage over a button-based system that a malfunctioning microcontroller cannot randomly open a door at inopportune times, though this is a rather academic advantage given that I am unaware of such cases.)<p>I have myself ridden the 377, and on one occasion I did notice an unusual delay before the doors unlocked, of about a minute, which involved the &quot;door out of order&quot; lamp momentarily flashing on and off a few times, perhaps suggesting some sort of train reboot.<p>I find the term &#x27;GPS repeater&#x27; strange. The nature of GPS would lead me to believe that &#x27;repeating&#x27; GPS would be rather difficult, though I could be mistaken. It seems more likely that by &#x27;GPS repeater&#x27; what they actually mean is some sort of overriding &#x27;you are at station #27&#x27; signal, perhaps implemented much like the LU&#x27;s CSDE system. The Wikipedia page for SDO seems to confirm this (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_door_operation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_door_operation</a> - note that &#x27;Thameslink&#x27; and &#x27;First Capital Connect&#x27; are effectively synonymous).<p>The idea that not being able to quickly open the doors is a safety issue seems quite peculiar to me. On the 377 and all non-metro trains, all doors are fitted with passenger-operable emergency releases. There are also somewhat anonymous emergency releases which could be operated from outside the train by platform staff. Both such releases are mandated and governed by railway standard GM/RT2473 (which can be found here, along with some rail accident reports referencing it: <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=gm/rt2473"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=gm/rt2473</a> )<p>That said, there is one way in which the Class 377&#x27;s doors are implemented in an obviously deficient way: if you hold down the open button before the doors are unlocked, the doors will not open when they are. You then have to release and re-depress the button. In other words, whoever programmed the door erroneously chose an edge-triggered behaviour rather than a level-triggered one. This is in contrast to the buttons on the Class 319 (which the Class 377 is replacing), which behave correctly. I previously ranted about this here: <a href=""http://www.devever.net/~hl/train377"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.devever.net/~hl/train377</a>",1426363989

Opiates also have a high overdose potential, and when you combine tolerance-forming with high toxicity, people die. Yes, addicts can continue to get positive effects from the drug, but only by increasing dosage. And dosage can only be increased so many times before they die of overdose.<p>High-purity opiates are necessarily expensive. The street price is inflated because they&#x27;re illegal, and pharmaceutical companies have to jump through some hoops to avoid legal issues, and because of patents, but an addiction will always be expensive.<p>Some addicts can continue to function as a part of society, but others can&#x27;t. Many of them only become addicts after they are already unable to function, either due to mental health issues or overwhelming stress. I don&#x27;t mean to imply that these people are morally lesser because of their inability to perform as society expects them to, just that it&#x27;s a tragedy.<p>The drugs prescribed for mental health problems are scary, and probably over-prescribed, but they can also help. Lithium can be toxic, and it often quells the patient&#x27;s personality, but when used correctly it can improve the patient&#x27;s quality of life.<p>We might find that one day we prescribe opiates for short-term emotional pain, but they will never be appropriate for chronic issues. Even well-trained doctors make the mistake of prescribing analgesics for chronic pain like arthritis. If that&#x27;s the case then how can we expect untrained individuals suffering emotional pain and probably some mental health issues to make a good decision about buying opiates from a dispensary. And if it&#x27;s any harder for them than just going to a corner store and picking up the drugs, the illegal market will still thrive.<p>[1]: Really, it&#x27;s inappropriate to mock anyone for substance use, but I take by the tone of your comment that you agree with that.",1426363661

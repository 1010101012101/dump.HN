You can then be the voice telling him when to move on.<p>It sounds like he would benefit from a closer inspection of his working practises. Perhaps he needs to be managed in a different way. For example same amount of work just delivered as smaller tasks with shorter deadlines to avoid overwhelm. Maybe to start with, instead of him being part of an hourly weekly meeting, maybe he needs a 10 minute chat per day to help him to catch up, prioritise and plan the next day. This obviously would be the responsibility of his manager to take on.<p>Perhaps some training in planning out his working day in advance would throw out some interesting changes in how he learns to manage his own time.<p>I think the worst thing that could be done is to restrict his working hours which would add an extra level of worry - so he is sitting at home more stressed than if he was working.<p>The most important thing is to help him catch up so he is then receptive to support helping him keep on track.",1422363556

At times there may be suspicions and warrants to go after lawyers and journalists but at other times that may endanger whistleblowers and it should be overseen by judges issuing warrants.<p>> The UK government don&#x27;t misuse surveillance for political reasons, if they did there would be uproar. We&#x27;re not slipping into an authoritarian state, that would be completely at odds with British culture and where we&#x27;re really heading.<p>Prove it. And how would we ever find out that the government were misuing surveilance? A whistleblower could immediately be identified by correlating movements with the relevant journalist or internet traffic. Secondly trusting today&#x27;s government and security services isn&#x27;t enough you need to trust all future ones too.<p>> I&#x27;m just tired of seeing a trend of people who post here all spouting the same anti-surveilance, privacy is everything, ideals.

Your approach seems to be &quot;all&quot; privacy with little information on the &quot;greater good&quot; that will come from it or acknowledgments of the harms done.

This makes closing tabs much more difficult since you can&#x27;t just move your mouse all the way to the top of the screen and middle click--you have to consciously stop moving the mouse before it leaves the tab.<p>I can understand why they don&#x27;t touch the top of the screen: the tab stacking shows up above the tab. My suggestion would be to expand the tab to the top of the window, and then just make the tab stacking show up inside at the top of the tab. If not that, at least make the tab&#x27;s bounding box touch the edge of the screen and leave the tab stacking on top of it.<p>I found a few more issues while typing this up:
1. The browser seemed to think my CTRL key was stuck or something. Typing in my password on imgur made it switch tabs and zoom out multiple times when I went to type some of the numbers in my password.
2. Copying the image URL from the address bar after I uploaded it didn&#x27;t copy the protocol. The protocol was hidden since it&#x27;s http, but that adds an extra step of typing &quot;<a href=""http://&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://&quot;</a> when I wanted to paste it here.<p>The browser looks like it has promise. I like the look-and-feel. I like that the address bar is the progress bar when the page is loading. Being able to add notes and screenshots also seems like it would be incredibly useful.<p>Overall, I&#x27;d give the browser another shot once you&#x27;ve made some more progress.<p>[1] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/xMOacR5.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/xMOacR5.png</a>",1422361655

Lloyd longed for this kind of clear explanation for his combination of ambiguous symptoms. But he knew he didn’t have narcolepsy. Sleep didn’t hit his brain like a bolt of lightning; it was more like a slow, thick fog.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s really only describing cataplexy, which is one symptom of narcolepsy, and one that not even everyone with narcolepsy experiences (only about 70%). That&#x27;s the flashy one that people associate with narcolepsy where the person appears to just fall asleep out of nowhere, often as a reaction to emotional excitement (fright, happiness, etc. Every once in a while I&#x27;d make my ex laugh so hard that she&#x27;d have a cataplectic attack). Even cataplexy really isn&#x27;t &quot;falling asleep&quot;. It&#x27;s more of a sudden muscle paralysis. They remain fully conscious, but collapse and can&#x27;t physically function for a while.<p>The main symptom of narcolepsy that takes its toll on day to day life is &quot;excessive daytime sleepiness&quot; (that&#x27;s the technical term), which is basically just feeling tired and sluggish pretty much all the time, sleeping a lot but never feeling rested. Pretty much the same symptom that IH and sleep apnea patients have.<p>The difference is that with narcolepsy, the immediate cause of those symptoms appears to be poor sleep (which in turn is caused by something deeper and less well understood). Narcoleptics basically don&#x27;t get deep sleep cycles like the rest of us; they go straight to REM and miss out on slow wave sleep. If you fix that, the symptoms go away. One of current drugs for narcolepsy is sodium oxybate (tradename Xyrem), which is basically GHB, a heavy sedative. That sounds pretty counter intuitive based on the symptoms (give sedatives to someone who&#x27;s too tired all the time?), but makes sense when you think about it letting them get proper deep sleep.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not questioning the diagnosis in the article (I&#x27;m sure the doctors did the usual sleep latency tests and ruled out narcolepsy), but I just wanted to clear up a bit.

When you take your first step out of bed in the morning, you don&#x27;t know the _real_ behaviour of the floor (it&#x27;s made of atoms, after all), you &quot;only&quot; use a relatively high-level theory of solid materials to predict that it will support you before you step onto it. There is no guarantee that that will work out, but there is fundamentally no way to do better than that, all of science works that way, _everything_ we know about the world is &quot;a theory&quot;, even the atom theory is a theory, and the quantum theory is a theory, it&#x27;s all about modeling as best as we can, none of it is &quot;proven to be the real thing&quot;, and no scientist ever even tries to prove something to be &quot;the ultimate reality&quot;, all that matters to science is to make models more precise, and to figure out what those models seem to be sufficiently precise to use for - and then use them, which we do very successfully indeed.",1422360945

True photo security would practically require what is mandated for photocopiers with respect to counterfeiting; all cameras and all displays would have to be equally mandated to use watermarked images that encode encryption keys (e.g. your camera can only take a picture of another image if the associated key is one that has granted you access).

10112220,comment,10109617,10111643,0,0,rancur,,,"> most people really shouldn&#x27;t be paying attention<p>eh, IDK about that. I was cooping at a company that bottomed to $2.50 ~February 2008. I had been reading everything I could get my hands on regarding the Fed, their history, and general fiscal policy. I had about $7k in cash I was planning to dump into the company&#x27;s ticker.<p>But in February, when it was $2.50, I wasn&#x27;t quite confident of my analysis.<p>In May or so I had completed my replica-painting of the full picture, I was sure enough to make a jump. Unfortunately the stock had rebounded to ~$9 by then. I&#x27;d missed my chance, Fed had already moved, markets were assured, life was continuing on as normal. They later got bought out (4 years later) for $22/share. Would have wiped out my student debt.<p>Note, this was not trading on any special insider information I had, it was simply my personal analysis of the stability of the company&#x27;s business model in a rough economic environment, combined with confidence in Bernanke&#x27;s unwillingness to permit much of any form of market turmoil (he received his PhD for his analysis of what the Fed did wrong that lead to the great depression-- conclusion: not nearly enough).<p>off topic: my next BUY recommendation was ARMH in 2010 ~$12.50. I figured nobody could be so much dumber than me and my expertise to not also see the imminent growth of the smartphone market at a time when half of everyone I knew were still on flipphones. So then I checked later and they&#x27;d made it all the way to $30-something.<p>so then I said to myself &#x27;no more&#x27; and bought NVDA at $16, but had to sell at $12 for other reasons.

We&#x27;d both have worked the same number of days, and overall the policy would be <i>simpler to understand</i> if vesting was pinned only to start date or hours reported on your paystub.<p>On the flip side: I was eligible for more stock in my first annual review[0]; if I&#x27;d started two weeks later I would not have been eligible for full additional year. This despite the fact that review conversations typically happen in March/April.<p>If I&#x27;m being uncharitable (and after having had conversations with managers about Amazon&#x27;s total compensation philosophy in which raises are scaled back if the stock did well but not scaled up proportionally if the stock underperformed, I am perfectly willing to be uncharitable here), I would believe that large chunks of their compensation system are structured around an average employee tenure of roughly 18-30 months. If you assume that, it almost looks like the company has gone out of its way to minimize the amount it will actually have to pay to people while maximizing the amount it looks like they&#x27;re offering.<p>It&#x27;s not that there&#x27;s anything <i>wrong</i> with it, it&#x27;s just that it feels sleazy, particularly in retrospect.<p>[0]: Not that I actually saw any of it, because unlike my current gig where refreshes begin vesting immediately Amazon&#x27;s refreshes don&#x27;t start vesting until ~18 months after they&#x27;re granted.",1440442544

And while we&#x27;re at it, they could stop displaying brochures from those companies in their offices, wearing the free lab coats, and so on.  Or better yet, stop accepting sales calls from them altogether.  And if they wanted this to be effective, they could push to make these ethical conditions part of the requirements for professional society membership and even state licensing.<p>I am sympathetic with the frustrated physician whose patients refuse to accept that there are any benefits to drug treatments.  I am also sympathetic with the patient who has spent his entire life hearing nothing but rosy assessments of drugs pumped out by the manufacturers even though many are completely ineffective and many others have been removed from the market because they proved unsafe.  There are ways to improve this, but all three parties (as well as the FDA, in the US) are going to have to give.  Drugmakers need to stop advertizing their products to patients and physicians.  Physicians need to leverage their professional associations to ensure that they are properly informed about new drugs, from impartial sources.  Patients need to insist that their physicians follow these guidelines and then trust them, or find a different physician that they can and will trust.  And the FDA needs to be at once much more demanding: many drugs are approved despite little evidence, or unreliable evidence, of effectiveness; and much less so: the interminable process of approval needs to be cut way down, especially for drugs that have a narrow base of potential patients.<p>Trust is gone, and needs to be repaired.  You build or rebuild trust by being trustworthy, going far out of your way not only to show that you are worthy but to go well beyond what would otherwise be necessary.  If you want patients to trust you, you need to do everything possible to earn it.",1440442433

Why?<p>There are a lot of things that have gone into that question. I would say the biggest thing was that I became aware of the fact that I was always &#x27;in my head&#x27; instead of having a more direct interaction with people/environment, and realizing (from a number of sources, but importantly, through meditation) that being not &#x27;in your head&#x27;—direct interaction with things—is a major part of feeling content or satisfied (as well as being effective in... most domains). Makes sense if you think about it: you think when you are trying to change something; if nothing needs changing, you don&#x27;t think and you&#x27;re content.<p>Now I&#x27;m looking for a balance with social interaction, physical activity, and intellectual work. Since I&#x27;ve been unable to earn money from my own projects, I am giving them up to just do a normal 40hrs/week kind of programming job: if I try to do the job and the projects, there&#x27;s no time for the balance I want.<p>After a few years I may get a job that&#x27;s more physical/social and return to my projects, but for now I need to catch up on finances, and programming is the only way I know how.<p>Edit: another way of saying the above: anxiety/depression became a problem, and the balance I describe seems to be a major part of the solution.",1440442259

A non-trivial portion of society has shown it is possible to not be obese. People have also shown it is possible to go from being obese to not being obese.<p>There are several inter-playing factors that shoulder most the blame I would say.<p>One major factor that seems to be missing from most conversations is that there is a huge mental factor in obesity I would surmise. And I think you&#x27;re overlooking that when you ask why do some people feel satiety when others don&#x27;t.<p>I think obesity can rightly be considered a mental illness. Why do some people continue to eat when it does their body no good? Everyone probably does this on occasion, but why do obese people do it routinely?<p>Most obese people I&#x27;m guessing would tell you that a lot of their eating has an emotional component, beyond a feeling of hunger.<p>When you think about it, present day &quot;food&quot; companies, are just as bad as tobacco companies, arguably worse when you calculate the costs. How many people are suffering from diabetes, or potentially will in coming years, how many from other &#x27;diseases of civilization,&#x27; what amount of health and monetary resources are expended on these preventable conditions each year?<p><i>These are diseases of a civilization that is structured poorly.</i> Just think about it, a civilization of overworked, overstressed, underslept, mindless-media over-exposed people who emotionally stuff their faces with garbage &#x27;foods.&#x27;<p>The &quot;food&quot; industry and regulation there of no doubt shoulders a lot of blame, just consider for some people, the majority of their food energy intake comes basically from candy.<p>It appears that &#x27;food&#x27; companies are exploitative of the low iq, low income segments of our society, but in the US I think that has a lot to do with agricultural policies that subsidize sugar and corn production and the like. And the people running these &quot;food&quot; companies navigate current market dynamics and govt incentives/subsidies to maximize shareholder returns, and that is producing negative health results for many people.<p>So with these factors considered, I would say that there are better ways of addressing this issue than the search for obesity immunity conferring pills and the like.",1440441657

A bunch of reasons:<p>* Politicians are quickly going to learn how hostile Twitter is, and assign professional spindroids to their accounts (or to filter the messages that they themselves post).<p>* It&#x27;s not like Twitter can prevent deleted tweets from leaking. They&#x27;ll get screenshot anyways. This just keeps the delete-shaming phenomenon from being shoved in everyone&#x27;s face.<p>On a previous thread about Twitter, someone pointed out that Twitter shouldn&#x27;t do this because they should behave like infrastructure. But Twitter doesn&#x27;t want to be infrastructure; the infrastructure market position is very bad for them.",1440441475

After all, low-level memory is just an array of bytes.<p>We <i>do</i> have a convention that dereferencing a memory address returns the 8 bits to the <i>right</i> of that address. We&#x27;ve even optimized our hardware for that convention. But that&#x27;s just a convention of the dereference operation; it&#x27;s not fundamental to the addresses themselves.<p>I agree that a C pointer isn&#x27;t analogous to an array index; that&#x27;s because a pointer is a <i>range</i>, determined by a pair of memory addresses. One, stored at runtime, refers to the location before the first byte of the range. The other, implicitly derived from the runtime value and the size information in the pointer type, refers to the location after the last byte of the range. When we think of memory addresses as the article&#x27;s indexes, and pointers as the article&#x27;s ranges, everything falls into place.<p>(Incidentally, please be careful calling out people for not understanding computers. C isn&#x27;t actually the lowest level of computing, and pointers aren&#x27;t as primitive as your post implies. When you call someone out, you need to be 100% clear and 100% right.)",1440441049

This remains true even when the mainstream medicine is highly affordable, or even when the person in question has good health insurance.<p>I saw an interesting case recently. Somebody stepped on a rusty nail (I didn&#x27;t know that was something that actually happened!) and of course they weren&#x27;t up to date on their tetanus shot, since vaccines are deadly poison. They asked friends what to do and got a variety of answers, most being some variation on &quot;whatever you do don&#x27;t get the shot, it will kill you,&quot; with various crazy alternative cures proposed. Ultimately they went to an urgent care clinic and got the vaccine.

You might come up with rationalizations about why, say, eating ham is bad for you, but ultimately a religious person with a pork prohibition will avoid it because it&#x27;s just not right. And someone who believes eating pork is sinful can still easily end up wanting it, so it ends up being a weird internal struggle.<p>On another note, at least among the people I know there is vast overlap between people who use alternative medical treatments and people who believe in stuff like chemtrails.

The corollary is that if you adjust your intake to X (where X might have to be determined empirically for the individual), and use planning and your conscious brain to know when and what to eat, you _will_ lose weight.<p>People talk about how hard it is to lose this way, but although I&#x27;ve tried diet after diet, I only recently understood intuitively the reverse: why some people can&#x27;t understand how difficult it is for some.  When I moved to a new area this year and went to a new GP, he wanted to talk about my weight, of course (I&#x27;m 42, but everything else about my health was quite good).  I explained that I had managed to lose about 50 pounds since my peak in 2012, through various diets like intermittent fasting, keto, and sometimes just counting calories for a bit.  He suggested I try an appetite suppressant.  I scoffed a bit, saying that my problem wasn&#x27;t that I was too hungry, since I rarely ate so infrequently as to experience hunger.  Instead, I said, my problem was that I ate when I was bored, or when friends were, or ate to improve other experiences like TV or movies, or just because it had been a while and I felt increasingly that I &quot;ought&quot; to eat.  He didn&#x27;t argue with me, but just mildly pointed out that it might well not work, but why not give it a shot for a few weeks and see?  So I agreed.  That was three months ago, and on the appetite suppressant I&#x27;ve lost another 50 pounds.  But that&#x27;s not my point, exactly.<p>My worldview around food has changed.  Before, I assumed that people who were thin were either heroically couting every calorie they ate, or had some weird biology that meant that they couldn&#x27;t gain even when they tried.  I think both of those sets do exist (since I know people in each), but now I realize that there is a large group of people out there who simply don&#x27;t care about food that much.  I didn&#x27;t even understand that I <i>had</i> this constant drive to eat until it vanished; I&#x27;d never not experienced it, as far back as I can remember.  <i>I didn&#x27;t know what people were talking about when they talked about appetite</i>, because the only thing that ever changed was <i>hunger</i>, until I started taking the suppressant.",1440439748

Basically, if the stock has done really well in the past year, your salary increase and stock bonus in your next annual review will be adjusted accordingly. If you&#x27;ve done really well and they&#x27;d strongly regret you leaving, you can negotiate on this, but only if you&#x27;ve got leverage. After my first full year there they offered me a 2.3% salary increase, zero additional stock[0], and when I pushed back said &#x27;look how well the stock has done! you&#x27;re going to make way more this year than you had expected&#x27;.<p>I politely informed them that they seemed to be trying to feed me a pile of bullshit, that bullshit wasn&#x27;t part of my approved diet, and that if they continued trying to do so, this would be my last week with Amazon.

I&#x27;d started January 3rd of the preceding year. They believed only people employed prior to Jan 1st qualified. I had brought my offer letter to the meeting, after having been warned to be prepared for these sorts of shenanigans, which clearly said that because I&#x27;d started prior to Jan 15th, I was absolutely eligible.

That presents a curious mathematical problem: who are all those extra men partnering with?<p>Let&#x27;s say the average reported number of sex partners for males is 11.7 [1]. Now that means that the set of men has a number of connections into the set of women times 11.7. Say, the number of men in the set is 31M [2], then the number of connections is 362.7M. For the set of women, the numbers are 7.7, 32.2M, and 247.94M, respectively.<p>The connections can terminate in either of the sets, so we can have M-M, M-F, or F-F connections.<p>At one unlikely extreme, we could have no heterosexual (M-F) pairings at all, so that means 11.7 gay partners for men, and 7.7 lesbian partners for women. Clearly, this isn&#x27;t the reality, not even in the UK. But even if we map all the connections from the female set to males, we&#x27;ll end up with 247.94M hetero connections, no lesbian connections, and 114.76 connections from the male set onto itself, or 8.0 hetero + 3.7 gay connections per male, and 7.7 hetero + 0 lesbian connections per female.<p>There may be a large number of spinsters, and a small number of gay people may be skewing the mean away from the mode for the males, but the important take-away is that, mathematically, hetero-sexual partnerships always draw from both sets equally, and therefore the mean number of heterosex partners is always the same across the whole population.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/11November/Pages/Results-of-UK-Sex-Survey-Published.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/11November/Pages/Results-of-UK-S...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/population-and-household-estimates-for-the-united-kingdom/stb-2011-census--population-estimates-for-the-united-kingdom.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/population-...</a>",1440439585

Not your application logic!  Not your web framework!  Not your idiom for string concatenation!<p>If you have three CSS files, condensing them to 1 CSS file is as close to zero technical risk as any intervention in the history of engineering, will take you far under a man-day to implement a process to correct this defect, and will provide instant, lasting, guaranteed performance gains everywhere you were using those three files.<p>If you don't gzip your Javascript, CSS, and HTML yet...<p>If you have spent weeks thinking about how to use memcached and not so much as a minute discussing expires headers...",1248098306

Probabilistic caching and/or ruthless pruning of cold flows can probably render the ""exploding cache"" attack impossible or at least impractical.<p>What bothers me more is routing table updates. I don't see how they can avoid invalidating the whole flow cache on each routing flap. OTOH, rebuilding the said top 20% of flows should be pretty fast, too.",1248098037

I think that still counts as DRM, it's only less intrusive.</i><p>No, this is patently false. The name of the buyer encoded in audio files is nothing like DRM.<p>DRM is a technological solution designed to limit your possible actions. And under the DMCA, you are not allowed to circumvent encryption techniques designed to protect copyright even if for the right reasons (like when you own the copyright of the file you're trying to decrypt).<p>The name of the buyer is just a ""watermark"" used to trace the original source. Watermark or not, legally you are still not allowed to distribute copyrighted works without having the permissions to do so. But you still have a choice to bend the rules, at your own risk ... i.e. there's no technology guarding your immediate actions.<p>From a social p.o.v., it's the difference between ""innocent until proven guilty"" and ""guilty by default, tracking device attached"".",1248097878

714385,comment,714317,714326,0,0,mquander,,,"But who is the ""we"" who is guiding the navigation?  On the one hand, you have millions of programmers and engineers like you and me, who are working toward some short- or medium-term technological goals.  However, those goals are hardly chosen out of the blue.  Many of us are working on goals determined by some arcane corporate bureaucracy, which we would never have chosen on our own.  Others are working on goals which are self-selected, but reflect the needs of the rest of our society and our existing technological framework.  The growth of bandwidth and storage (and the software to power them), for example, have such compelling entertainment applications that if one of us didn't work on them, a thousand others would.<p>On the other hand, if you look for the driving force behind those needs and corporations, you don't find any more control.  In America, we have a central administration, backed by hundreds of representatives, who are guided by thousands of advisors and staff and lobbyists, elected by three hundred million Americans through often dubious arguments and questionable motivation.  Hundreds of other nations can claim the same.<p>Nobody is navigating.",1248097558

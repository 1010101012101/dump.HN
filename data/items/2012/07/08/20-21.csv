Likewise, I can't do their work (I've tried management, it sucked for me, I won't try it again).<p>My current boss [and one of the best I've had, btw] puts it thusly: ""You solve problems with designs and lines of code. I solve problems by putting the right people in the right places."" It's an over-simplification of both sides, but it contains a lot of the truth.<p>Trouble starts when managers (who should be doing people-level stuff) get their mitts into technical stuff, especially when they start ""laying down the law"" without proper background.

Unfortunately, increasing the flow of money to the begging sector increases the number of beggars, it does not make individual beggars better off.  There is no law preventing potentially productive people from begging, and if you go around handing out 25,000 rupees to people who look like beggars, more potential workers will dress up accordingly.

4215682,comment,4215118,4215118,15,0,ThomPete,,,"This is IMHO the correct way to do these things. Seymore Papert wrote a brilliant book on the subject.<p>Here is the forword to his book:<p><a href=""http://www.papert.org/articles/GearsOfMyChildhood.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.papert.org/articles/GearsOfMyChildhood.html</a><p>From the link:<p>*\nOne day I was surprised to discover that some adults--even most adults--did not understand or even care about the magic of the gears. I no longer think much about gears, but I have never turned away from the questions that started with that discovery: How could what was so simple for me be incomprehensible to other people? My proud father suggested ""being clever"" as an explanation. But I was painfully aware that some people who could not understand the differential could easily do things I found much more difficult. Slowly I began to formulate what I still consider the fundamental fact about learning: Anything is easy if you can assimilate it to your collection of models. If you can't, anything can be painfully difficult. Here too I was developing a way of thinking that would be resonant with Piaget's. The understanding of learning must be genetic. It must refer to the genesis of knowledge. What an individual can learn, and how he learns it, depends on what models he has available. This raises, recursively, the question of how he learned these models. Thus the ""laws of learning"" must be about how intellectual structures grow out of one another and about how, in the process, they acquire both logical and emotional form.*<p>This kind of programming environment despite the stars in here scolding it is exactly how to teach IMHO.<p>What this allow children to do is to tinker with words and through an input/output model allow them to learn about variables.<p>There is no right or wrong output here (perhaps besides gramatically) there is only input/output.<p>The basic of computer-science is it not?",1341780988
4215681,comment,4214800,4215166,3,0,gue5t,,,"A caveat: GTK3 brought a lot of changes in GTK/GDK internals including how window sizing was handled, both based on widget size requirements and based on user interactions for resizing. This was intended in part to provide better support for WM paradigms like Windows and Wayland where clients have more control of their own size, and resulted in UI additions like resize grips by default in the corner of windows. It also cleaned up the code to be less semantically tied to X11's windowing rules. In many cases it's more efficient to use a single toplevel window and do logic application-side than make the X server work harder (due to context switches and changes in rendering codepaths).<p>The downside to these changes is that several GTK3 features were horribly broken outside of GNOME's default window manager. I've seen at least five or six window managers that would freeze applications with the mouse grabbed as of GTK3.2: click on the wrong part of a menubar or on the resize corner and you had to resort to the keyboard to kill the offending application before it or your mouse would work. Version 3.4 or thereabouts has fixed these bugs for the most part; even window managers that don't support much in the way of ClientMessage-based window manager protocols should work fine now. But for some time GTK3 did interact very poorly with most window managers.<p><a href=""http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=630972"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=630972</a><p>That this was so hairy and bug-prone is, in my opinion, a symptom of interacting with the ugly beast that is X11.

You're describing the average economist there, unfortunately. :)<p>Bundling all 100 channels for $40 doesn't benefit <i>everyone</i>. There are a ton of assumptions embedded in that analysis that may, or may not be true. You assume that every channel yields positive marginal utility, for example.<p>Personally, I would pay for <i>maybe</i> three cable channels. But each additional channel would lower my utility because of the knowledge that I was contributing to its existence (I sleep better at night knowing that I am not contributing to the development of shows about obese people with 14 children, etc.). Thus, I do not have cable at all.<p>You also assume that each channel costs the same to provide. Under an a-la-carte pricing scheme the prices would be all over the map because cable providers couldn't afford to offer certain channels for $1. So ""the average customer chooses 30"" would become a bit more complicated.<p>There are also probably psychological issues in play. For instance, why aren't HBO and Showtime part of ""basic"" cable? Surely they could make more money through bundling! Starz was included (bundled) with Hulu (or was it Netflix?) for awhile, but it was removed because the network feared losing its image as a ""premium"" brand. I suspect HBO feels the same way.<p>Beyond this, a television channel <i>is</i> a bundle in itself. You get a set of shows (or even episodes) and movies that you can't alter. So even if channels were un-bundled, the bundling would just move from cable providers to networks themselves, or to other intermediaries such as Hulu.",1341779741

Particularly:<p>(1) ""The general principle is: if a program is going to crash, it should crash as soon, as noisily, and as often as possible. (This quote comes from the GHC coding style guidelines, and was originally written by Alastair Reid, who worked on an early version of the RTS.)""<p>(2) ""The code of the RTS is littered with assertions to check these kinds of things. Assertions are our go-to tool for finding bugs before they manifest; in fact, when a new invariant is added, we often add the assertion before writing the code that implements the invariant.""<p>(3) ""So, the debug RTS has an optional mode that we call sanity checking. Sanity checking enables all kinds of expensive assertions, and can make the program run many times more slowly. In particular, sanity checking runs a full scan of the heap to check for dangling pointers (amongst other things), before and after every GC. The first job when investigating a runtime crash is to run the program with sanity checking turned on; sometimes this will catch the invariant violation well before the program actually crashes.""<p>This article made me respect the people around Haskell even more.",1341779343

It is not safe to roam about in wee hours not even for men. Except may be in Mumbai and a few more cities. I would advice any other visits against it.<p>Oh and people who have praised the word 'jugaad', in most cases it is a illegal-immoral solution. I hate it when people glorify the act. It is a reality and it is present everywhere in India - but I hope that we grow out of it.<p>You can divide the country into three parts: (A) The Powerful (who are always rich) (B) The not-so-rich and not-so-powerful (C) The poor and powerless. People of class (A) are leaders, businessmen and politicians who are also lawmakers. Class (B) is the middle to high income families who think political dialogue is a stinking business to be a part of. Class (C) is the overwhelming majority who vote and get paid for it - either directly or through improper political practices from caste/region/religion based arguments.<p>We have a huge population with few resources. We don't have enough fuel to dump our waste, not even enough ground to dump them on. We have very high unemployment and low literacy. Even the education system that we have is largely of very low quality. Cross Border Terrorism that is so not a daily part of western life is now too boring to be covered on Indian television. North India is so accustomed to it that people have even stopped demanding action - we don't think our government can take any. We also face Naxalism [1], a reality that a lot of us don't understand as it is largely based in Southern/Eastern India.<p>We regularly see large scale corruption ($1B+), as frequently as once every year. The culprits come back to power in a few years (An example: [2]). And people vote for them, because there is no better choice. This is unlike say USA when similar things would have been ends of political career for people involved.<p>BUT, please stop commenting on India as a comparison to the US and the rest of the western world. We get it, you have cleaner cities, healthier people, lesser discrimination and no unhappiness. We know it well, we live by it every day. These commentaries just seem unnecessary. We are innately handicapped in the race of development. We have started off late [3]. We have started off behind [4]. It is also very arrogant to impose your morality to the ancestors of others [5] as even if they may agree to what you say, they cannot comment on the situation in the previous era as they are unaware of the context themselves. It is very rude to use it as an argument against the present.<p>And let's make it clear. India is no more spiritual than any other country on earth. We just have a lot more temples and monasteries than most places. And they are also old and diverse. These exact things that attracts most westerners to India - the ancientness and the abundance, are also very closely related to what westerners hate about India. You cannot have orthodox, untainted and non-commercialized establishments without the perils of unorganized, corrupt and ill-managed institutes. Remove both, and you have a country that is working just as vigorously towards modern (and very western) ideologies and standards of living.<p><pre><code>  [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naxalite\n  [2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fodder_Scam\n  [3] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Independence\n  [4] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj#Economic_impact\n  [5] http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4214998 [Sec: Sati]</code></pre>",1341779340

4215561,comment,4214662,4214662,4,0,nirvana,,,"This reminds me of the Tragedy of IMDB, once again.  Many people may not know or remember, but IMDB (and CDDB which had a similar fate) were some of the great early ""open source"" works of the internet-- millions of movie (and music) buffs painstakingly compiled information to create these massive databases.  They gave the sites the data for free as part of an agreement that the sites would make that data available for free to everyone.<p>They grew like crazy and became really useful-- for instance in the early days of playing CDs on computers the CD programs (this is before MP3 rippers) would connect to CDDB to look up the tracks to display while playing the CD (since this info wasn't on the CD in digital form.)   Later MP3 rippers used this data to automagically put the right metadata into MP3 files.<p>But eventually the dotcom mania happened and everything with a dotcom suddenly was valuable.  So it isn't a surprise that these guys who created these volunteer sites sold them out.  IMDB, which uses data created voluntarily by members of the internet, sold to Amazon which now charges a massive premium price for access to the data (they keep a subset of it free on restrictive terms, possibly as terms of the sale, but they really try to limit the utility to maximize their profits among those who want to know about in production movies, etc.)   It used to be that IMDB was a great place to find out info about in-production movies, etc, but that data is now stripped (Though the titles remains so people think there just is no data.)<p>When I was an employee of Amazon, I had a free imdb-pro account.  There's a whole lot of data IMDB is not showing you unless you pay.   And of course, IMDB is still crowd sourcing most of its content!<p>This has extended to the data you can download. Back in the 1990s you could download the entire IMDB database.  No more.  The page about their ""offline dataset"" calls it a ""Subset"", but they never say what it is a subset of (%1 of the movies?  Could be it seems pretty small.)  The ""movie-database-faq"" we are to use as guide to the data is the rtfm faq (even with links to rtfm.mit.edu) from back in the day when IMDB was a free database, and apparently hasn't been updated in 15 years.<p>Their offline dataset does not include Ratings.  In fact the data seems really almost deliberately useless (but I just started looking at it.) For instance, Movies.list is just a list of movie titles.  Complete-cast.list just indicates whether they have verified the complete cast - by title.  Either they are using the movie title + supplementary information and year as the foreign key (which seems fraught with peril) or there isn't a good way to reconstruct a relational database from this data.<p>Sorry, excuse me for that rant.  It just seems fraudulent in a way to crowd source a database from the community with the promise of making it available to the community and then sell out and have that data taken away and used for profitable purposes.<p>This cuts off a lot of useful apps (like the one this topic is about originally) that would otherwise be built easily using this data.

One could argue that these countries initially had feudal-style serfdom, yet in both of them serfdom was abolished earlier than in the Russian Empire (1770-1830 in Germany, 1848 in Austria-Hungary, 1861 in Russia), and the standard of living continued to increase after the abolition of serfdom.<p>I am not a huge lover of big empires, yet I consider the typical postcolonial argument which goes basically ""white people are responsible for everything"" as politically motivated and leading to victim mentality, which further inhibits progress. If you want to see a true example of exploitation, look at Congo under King Leopold. The British regime was lollipops and roses by comparison. If you look at hubs of economic activity in South-East Asia, and which in no small manner are still influencing Asian economic growth -- Singapore, Hong Kong -- all of them are former British colonial outposts.<p>If you take a country/people where accumulating wealth is not a culturally-established practice, and introduce wealth to this country through trade/industry/oil exploration, you won't get a reduction of poverty -- you will get more poverty, since the wealth you introduced can now sustain more people at their previous standard of living. This is, by the way, why having a conversation with postcolonialists can be completely impossible -- they place such an emphasis on differences between cultures when talking about pretty much anything, but when you hint that willingness to save money and plan for the future can also be culturally influenced, they get red in the face.",1341778179

Google has cultural problems as any large company will, but they're fundamentally different (and less damaging to a technical firm) than the kind that MBA-culture creates. You could take 10 random Googlers and ask them to do a startup and they'd probably build something awesome. That's not true of the companies where MBA culture dominates.<p>I think one of Google's weaknesses is that there's an unspoken mentality that engineering is for smart people and everything else is for people who couldn't cut it. That might be why Google has excellent engineers but incompetent PMs and middle managers. If you think that engineering is what smart people do and PM work is for idiots, guess who ends up making product decisions?<p>Another of Google's weaknesses is that there are places where the engineering mentality doesn't apply, and Google doesn't seem to get that. Example 1: the Perf system has those nonsense calibration scores. They don't add anything; they just add another SPOF. It's data collection for the sake of data collection. But it turns out, in the real world, that data can be harmful. It can be used in ways that are really disgusting. (That's why Real Names is such an issue.) Google never got that. Example 2: the 3-word mission statements were a really bad idea. Same with downslotting. Engineers are supposed to fly with crazy ideas and give demos when things are still scrappy and rough. But in management, you really can't deploy an idea until you know whether it's good or not, because it's going to affect peoples' careers, and if you deploy a shitty idea it's hard to backtrack and take it all back. Downslotting never should have gotten through the door.<p>Google has some excellent engineers and many of them are people I'd love to work with again, but the place is losing its culture.

4215519,comment,4214403,4215142,6,0,ten_fingers,,,"> Most areas of CS you do are unlikely to need advanced calculus or topics that depend on it (differential equations, topology, measure theory...).<p>Right.  The only advanced calculus text I listed was 'Baby Rudin', and the main contribution there is just to get some of the more important properties of the real numbers, Euclidean n-space, infinite sequences and series, and Riemann integration solid.<p>If a CS student is to stop before these topics, okay, but if they are going to go on then these topics will be part of what is generally assumed.<p>For CS, as we know, it is doing what EE did -- moving beyond its core tools and into what to do with those tools.  E.g., EE got into nonlinear filtering and stochastic integration.  E.g., CS is now getting into both optimization and statistics.  Then being handy with that Baby Rudin material, at least the early chapters, will get to be important.<p>With Baby Rudin already done, there can be a good course in differential equations, and such a course can be a good way to see some of the value of what did in linear algebra and Baby Rudin and to exercise that material.  At some point in the future, a CS guy might well get into some work involving differential equations -- viral growth models, flight of airplanes and space vehicles, and much of mechanical engineering.<p>One of the main themes in the future of computer applications is handling 'randomness', and my view is that serious work in that direction should have the measure theory foundations.  I did an A/B on that!  Early in my career I tried the easy way.  After measure theory, Neveu, Breiman, Loeve, Dynkin, Lipster, Shiryaev, etc., I concluded that the measure theory approach to probability, stochastic processes, and statistics was essential.<p>In particular, without measure theory, people too easily get totally stuck in the mud on what 'random' means, while with measure theory Kolmogorov has a really nice answer.  My view is that people may not like Kolmogorov's answer but that, with some really simple assumptions, we get forced into that answer anyway!<p>For the rest, the Hilbert and Banach spaces won't go away!  E.g., a huge dessert buffet of really finger lick'n good applications of the Hahn-Banach theorem is David G. Luenberger, 'Optimization by Vector Space Methods', and that book will be a nice source of methods for a lot that computing people might encounter.<p>> You left out graph theory and combinatorics, both of which are extremely important to CS.<p>For combinatorics, I assumed that one would get enough, in some ways deeper than in Knuth's TACP, from abstract algebra and elementary probability.  E.g., combinatorics is a lot about counting, and so is group theory in abstract algebra.<p>For graph theory, I assumed that one would get enough from optimization on networks.  E.g., a 'basis' in the network simplex method on a network is a minimum spanning tree!  And the max flow/min cut theorem can follow just from linear programming.  Dynamic programming, which I mentioned, can be viewed as graph theory.<p>I did mention linear programming (and so does CLRS), and one reason is that in the CS study of algorithms the algorithms for linear programming are important, and surprising, benchmarks.  Also integer linear programming is one of the more important motivations for the question of P versus NP.<p>For some of the surprise, the simplex algorithm has low degree polynomial expected performance (K.  Borgward) but exponential worst case performance (Klee and Minty), but the polynomial algorithms (Khachiyan) when they are faster than simplex have both of them too slow for practice!  So, at one of the first places we looked at computational complexity for problems more challenging than, say, heap sort and AVL trees, an exponential algorithm turned out to be superior in nearly every sense of interest to a polynomial algorithm!  There never was a guarantee that the study of computational complexity would be easy!<p>But there's a lot of overlap:  I didn't mention courses in 'finite mathematics', combinatorics, or graph theory, but one way and another what I described should provide enough coverage.  I didn't mention the CS book CLRS, but I mentioned good coverage of some of the more advanced topics in that book.  Or, there is a lot of blending old wine and pouring it into new bottles.<p>There is a broad point:  A major theme in CS now is to borrow, modify, and apply work done some years ago in applied math, especially from operations research, e.g., linear programming, flows on networks, stochastic point processes, and statistics.  While CS has some new applications, typically the material is done more carefully in the old applied math sources.  So, I emphasized learning the material as math instead of as CS.  Besides, the OP was asking about math for CS and not 'mathematical CS'!  Also the title asked for the ""hard way""!<p>There's another broad point:  What to learn and why to learn it?  Just a first cut view of what O( n ln(n) ) means should take only a little searching on the Internet.  Besides, Knuth's TACP is quite clear on such 'asymptotics'.  I wish Microsoft's MSDN documentation of .NET was as clear and easy to read as TACP!<p>One reason not to learn this stuff is to confirm that Knuth, Sedgewick, CLRS, etc. were correct after all!<p>Generally the reason to learn such stuff is for new applications in the future.  For that, my view was just to stay with a relatively traditional course in relatively applied math although I leaned away from classic mathematical physics and more to business applications.",1341778045

Even better, I've frequently written code for the first time, hit the compile button, and had it work first time - something that almost never happens to me with Java or C.\n2) The huge, HUGE caveat to that is that it's only true for pure and sufficiently polymorphic code. If you're writing anything in the IO monad, or if you're using specific data types (e.g. Int, []) rather than writing polymorphic code, then all bets are off.<p>There's only one way (ignoring ) to write the forward pipe operator (|>) :: a -> (a -> b) -> b in Haskell. If your code compiles, it's guaranteed to be correct.<p>There are many, many ways to write the isPrime :: Integer -> Bool function, which differ widely in correctness, understandability and efficiency. Once you move from type variables to concrete types, you open yourself up to many more potential errors.<p>There are even more ways to write the function deleteFile :: FilePath -> IO (), including but not limited to (i) deleting the file and doing nothing else, (ii) deleting the file and its containing folder, and (iii) wiping your entire filesystem. All of these would type check. Sure, you probably wouldn't make these mistakes, but the point is that <i>the type system won't help you here any more than it would in <insert untyped language here></i>.<p>I think Haskell is an incredible language. It's certainly the  language I have the most fun with, and I find its approach to parallelism, concurrency, I/O and state to be natural and appealing. But there's a real danger of overstating what Haskell is capable of, and turning off newcomers to the language in the process.",1341777994

That's exactly what he mentions at the very end--the reason he trusted the type system so much is only because he believes there is only one non-trivial, non-recursive implementation with the requisite types. He qualifies exactly what he means and, moreover, does not even defend his behavior. And that is ""dangerous hubris""?<p>Also, there is certainly plenty of real-world code I would not like to write with Haskell--drivers, for example.

I built a peer-to-peer backup proof of concept in 1999, for example. (But knew, even while writing that code, that there bandwidth wasn't cheap enough for enough people for such a thing to take off.) The thing is, until very recently, my needs diverged a lot from all of the non-techies I know.<p>But that's less and less true. These days, most white collar workers depend completely on their computers (and phones and tablets) to do all of their work, every day. Corporate IT investment in ""collaboration"" tools like Sharepoint and Dropbox is large, and getting larger every quarter. Having access to your files, and the files that your colleagues share with you, and the various static resources your company maintains on your intranet, is becoming more and more important. So there's a clear business driver to build more sophisticated storage, access and sharing capabilities.<p>And, relatedly, many non-techies now use multiple computing devices every day. The laptop-plus-phone-plus-tablet user profile is the norm for more and more people. My sense is that iTunes Match and iCloud and various photo stream implementations are the special-purpose, walled-garden, leading edge indicators that this stuff will, eventually, get built into all our platforms and that we'll expect some level of interoperability between platforms.

I think maybe that's overestimating the impact in the short term. It's probably going to be a long time before you're going to be printing out the first usable objects (like the reprap's coat hangers, door handles and shoes) with minimal effort at, say, walmart quality and prices.",1225626802

351317,comment,350034,350034,0,0,markessien,,,"SSDs are the future. This is where the next big computer upgrade is going to be. The result, I think is that when rotational parts get completely removed from computers, we will see desktop software programmed for <i>instant</i> reaction. Using SSDs, most programs could be rearranged in a way that almost every standard usage happens in less than 1 second.",1225626402

But I stand by our solution even if it was made in ignorance.  It is the only bug tracking tool mentioned (besides the guy using git, good idea btw) that doesn't interrupt the workflow.",1225626318

351314,comment,350968,350968,0,0,jasonkester,,,"Lame.  This happened to me with my Yahoo mail account.  Twice.<p>The first time was way back when Yahoo first launched mail.  They actually lost EVERYBODY's accounts at one point early on, and you had to sign up again.  That was acceptable back in 1996!<p>The second time was 3 years ago.  Account gone.  1000s of important mails lost forever.  Yahoo doesn't have any form of customer service, so weeks of emailing them did no good.  Worse still, a couple years later when Yahoo bought Flickr, there went my Flickr account and all my photos.<p>I'm glad to see that Google employs real human beings that read their email and care about things like this!",1225625945

351308,comment,351293,351293,0,0,delano,,,"Ya, the command line is your friend.<p>We do something really similar using git. Our ""done"" directories are dated (""done-08-q4"") and we also have ""testing"" and ""delayed"" directories. Issues are moved to the testing directory in the same commit as the code changes and then to the done directory with a release.",1225624562
351307,comment,351293,351303,0,0,uuilly,,,"Right on, it looks really nice, but w/ dropbugz you never leave the command line.  You never log in to a site or search a DB or tag things etc etc.  It's just ls'ing grep'ing and vi'ing.  I find it less tedious and thus I'm more prone to log bugs as I develop / test.<p>I say again though, I'm working w/ a small team of developers and my needs are modest.  And if dropbugz fails me I'll check out lighthouse.",1225624039

Quick.as allows access to the search results from other sites in the one convenient location. The post explains how Quick.as provides you with better information than Google (or at very least the same); and after the commands become second nature, it allows you to access to the information you want quicker and with less mental processing.",1210056961

You haven't said what that might be.<p>If it's something that pivots entirely around a feature in Leopard, like Time Machine integration, then go for Leopard only. Otherwise, release for both Tiger and Leopard. Why not? Not everyone is using Leopard yet -- I read somewhere that the adoption so far is about half Leopard and half pre-Leopard. I'm not sure how accurate that is, but I have a hard time believing it's true.<p>I only updated to Leopard on my main workstation about a week ago.",1210056833

Nothing is stopping you from fixing the existing US govt healthcare system to provide the promised benefits.  When you do, then all you have to do to kill the private system is open up the fixed public system at cost.  Of course, that assumes that you can actually make govt healthcare work as you've asserted, but surely that's no big deal....",1210054981

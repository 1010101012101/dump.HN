5617422,comment,5616541,5617017,2,0,Natsu,,,"I was about to make most of those points, but in terms of meta... there are exactly four gold streams (3 lanes + jungle).  They could have people roll for one of those.  And no, pickpocket does not count as a real gold stream, any more than GP10s do.  I say that as a support Janna main.<p>Yes, there have been a few crazy strats, like the tournament game with the ""jungle"" Heimerdinger where they ran a push comp after their opponent picks had boxed the other team into a corner, but that sort of thing requires team coordination, in which case you're not worried about calling roles in the first place.<p>Matchmaking is a real problem and it sets people up for failure.  There are plenty of people who are simply not prepared to jungle or support.  Or, heck, depending on their lack of runes, they might not be able to tank, AP or ADC.  You can say ""you don't really need runes"" but when you have little practice already, going in unprepared is only going to make it worse.  I've supported without GP10s due to forgetting to change from a full ADC setup in champ select.  It's painful, sightstone or no sightstone to be that poor, even if it was hilarious to ignite a poor, unsuspecting enemy Sona for first blood at level 1.",1367060337
5617421,comment,5616462,5616462,2,0,bjourne,,,"Finance is a game of imperfect information. Most investors only has access to published information such as companies quarterly reports, so obviously, if you have an information advantage (by being an insider or knowing the next LIBOR rate) you can translate that into guaranteed profit.<p>Contrast finance with sports betting. If you bet on a hockey team, you have almost complete information about any variable you can imagine. The career of each player, how the team has performed so far, how far the away team has to travel (you use that to estimate the fatigue of the players), any player injuries and so on.<p>Surprisingly, sports betting is both more transparent and much more fair than finance because everyone has access to the same information. Sure, someone might know that the ice cleaning machine in the arena is malfunctioning so there may be debris left on the ice which may negatively effect one star players skating abilities and be able to exploit that information advantage. But it is marginal in comparison to the huge advantage traders and insiders can acquire in finance.<p>My point is that looking at finance as betting makes it much clearer what is going on. Some of the players have an information advantage and are exploiting it. The rest are getting screwed.",1367060290

And look at the raspberry-: The ethernet-controller/usb-hub combo eats about as much power as the CPU!<p>Then, the state of ""board support packages"": In contrast to x86 you cannot run a linux-kernel as-is, but rather it has to be patched for that particular board (in most cases): The linux-kernel has to be supplied with a lot of information on compile-time that is commonly provided by the BIOS on your typical PC. Furthermore a lot of the peripherals present inside those tiny ARM-chips have to have their drivers added:<p>Now the Raspberry- again, due to its popularity and enthusiastic community excels: You can basically get distributions with modern (now: 3.8.x) kernels ready to install. But if you are stuck on i.MX6, you get to use a patched 3.0.x-kernel (+2000 patches), with nvidia tegra it's at 3.1.x.

And those kernels tend to break in interesting ways as soon as you try to add your specific features, like getting a certain PCIe card to run with the i.MX6, or fiddle with the i2c-busses (on which power-management chips are present), ... and just are much, much, much less well-tested as the mainline kernels you are used to on ""normal"" PCs, or even the other more mature mainline architectures such as PowerPC (does anyone still use sparc/m68k/...?).<p>{Side-note: That's also the main pain for the independent android ports, such as cyanogen-mod. They normally get stuck on missing kernel patches, sourcecode, ... even though it's just ""an ARM"" chip.}<p>Of course, this is not at all a problem if you are happy with the stock BSP kernel/distribution and just want to compile node.js or mplayer for your board.",1367057668

You can glance at a notification and immediately know that you have a message, who sent the message, and how you received it. Takes half a second. Bluetooth earpieces are only suitable for sustained conversation. They are social faux pas because you are having a <i>sustained conversation</i> with someone else. This is not the case with HMDs - someone using a tool like Glass is actually <i>more</i> focused on their task and <i>less distracted overall</i> because they spend less time switching contexts. Citation: <a href=""http://dmrussell.net/CHI2010/docs/p1695.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dmrussell.net/CHI2010/docs/p1695.pdf</a><p>Second, glancing at an HMD is fundamentally different from pulling out a cell phone because you're not looking away from the other person. It is difficult to emphasize how important this is to people who have not done work in this field. It is <i>looking away</i> that breaks conversations, not <i>doing something else</i>. Conversation continues to work as long as the other person thinks you're looking at them. And having an HMD on is close enough that people don't react to you jumping away into glass-land to look something up or jot down a note. This one doesn't have a citation, but I <i>have</i> spent several years taking classes from the guy who now runs the Google Glass project, and I can tell you this from direct experience.<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again: please, please try these things before you dismiss them.

nearly every course she took in school,
K-Ph.D.  I was at or near the top of
the class in material I liked, essentially
just math, physics, and chemistry.  From 
those two examples, here are some lessons
on how to make good grades and/or do well.<p>I will start with what my wife did:  First,
care about making good grades; care a LOT.
Second,
actually do at least most of the reading
and homework.  Take good notes in class and
study them.  Work with other good students
in the class to share notes and thoughts on
the content of the course.  It helps to have
a terrific memory, and for that it helps to
really care a LOT.  It helps to cut out
nearly everything except course work and to
have the ability to do well with relatively 
little sleep.<p>Then, with the basic 
learning done, work with other good students
in the class to get a good view of what the
teacher likes to see on tests, term papers,
etc.  I.e., figure out how to please the
teacher, i.e., 'read' the teacher.  So, 
before tests, work with those other
good students to write out likely test
questions and together work out 
good answers.  Then
on a test with, say, four questions, may
have written out good answers to two or
three of the questions the night before.
Tough to compete against that.<p>For the 
other good students she worked with,
she had a room in the girls dorm
on the 'academic unit' with other
astoundingly bright girls, and they
shared draft test questions, etc.<p>Lucky
was not in a class with any of those
girls because would have come in at
best second.  For making As in college,
those girls were fantastic.<p>Of course they were beyond belief in
the humanities courses, e.g., could
actually make some sense out of the
mush.  But for a while my wife was in
pre-med so also made As in the
'filter' courses in organic chemistry
and comparative anatomy.<p>It also helps to have some just fantastic
academic talent:  My wife wanted to take
a course in European history but did not
want to have to work to make a good grade
so just audited the course.  The prof 
asked audits also to take the tests, so
my wife did.  At the end of the course,
a lecture course with 300 students, the
prof told my wife that she should have
taken the course for credit because she
made the highest score in the class.
And she didn't even seriously try.
Tough to compete against that!<p>For a term paper, she organized all the
information on index cards, arranged them,
then typed the paper.<p>She made high
school Valedictorian, in college was
'Summa Cum Laude', Woodrow Wilson,
PBK, and won two years of NSF graduate
fellowship in one award.<p>Then what I did:  In K-8, the girls
were much better students than I was
in penmanship, spelling, writing,
memorizing poetry, artistic drawing,
working in groups, clerical accuracy,
etc., all as should be expected.  Also
all the teachers were women and clearly
liked the girls much better than the
boys.  So, I gave up on trying to 
get good grades from the teachers 
and just pursued what interested me.<p>I was so often treated with such
contempt by the teachers that
for all the rest of my time in
school I was unconsciously terrified
of criticism from the teachers.  So,
if something didn't go just right
in a course, then I was terrified that
the situation was hopeless so gave
up.  So, really, I could be comfortable
in a course only if the material was
pure math with a level of precision
about like that of Bourbaki so that
I could be iron clad sure that my 
knowledge could not be questioned.
It was also good if I had carefully
read an excellent text before the
course and, thus, really already
knew the material.  K-12
teachers:  Quit hurting good
students.<p>Things made a big change in the
ninth grade in math:  I liked the math
and really cared.  I had no study
skills but began to develop some.
The teacher sent me to the state 
math tournament; I was likely at the
top of the class.  He realized that 
mostly I was learning just from the
book and told me that for the tournament
I should learn the last two chapters
on trigonometry he was not going to
be able to cover in class, so the 
weekend before the tournament I did.<p>That pattern went on:  I really liked
math and learned mostly from the book.
I really made no attempt to get good
grades from the teacher, but I 
understood the material so well I
got A or B from the teacher but 
led the class or nearly so on 
state standardized tests.<p>That pattern continued in college:<p>It worked out that I never took
freshman calculus!  The college
I went to for my freshman year didn't
want me to start with calculus
but put me in some course beneath 
what I'd already covered 
in my high school (that had a
relatively good math sequence).
So, I showed up only for the
tests and otherwise got a good
calculus book and dug in.
For my sophomore year I went to
a much better school, with a quite
good math department, and just
started with their sophomore
calculus.  Did fine.<p>In freshman physics, I really 
liked the material and
led the
class, effortlessly.<p>It was nice:
Often I studied the physics in the
gorgeous
reading room of the library.  There
some of the really pretty girls were wearing
some short, slightly full, plaid, heavy wool 
'wrap around' skirts, each held together
with a huge, chrome diaper safety
pin!  Still I got some physics done!
Got to really like physics to 
learn under such circumstances!<p>Some of the more advanced physics 
was badly taught
or from a poor book, and then my
grade fell to a B; I had no patience
with poor quality material.  But in math
the books were much better, and 
I did very well on both learning
the material and grades.  I got
Honors in math and 800 on the GRE
test of math knowledge and got
sent to an NSF summer program
in axiomatic set theory, modern
analysis, and differential geometry.
The differential geometry was 
lectures by a Harvard graduate
and student of A. Gleason.  He
said that I needed only the
inverse and implicit function
theorems, but so far I'd not
seen either of those (I
later got them from Fleming's book).  
I was
too intimidated to realize that
I could have hit the library for
an afternoon and evening and
walked out with good knowledge
of both theorems.  The theorems
are just local non-linear versions
of the standard and fairly obvious
general solution of a system of
linear equations.  There is a nice
proof using contractive mapping.
Alas, due to those two theorems,
I walked out of the class --
bummer, it was material I would
have liked to have learned, especially
for relativity theory.<p>In my career I continued a lot of
independent learning from some of the
best math texts, e.g., I took 
a second pass through Rudin's
'Principles', went carefully through
Halmos's 'Finite Dimensional Vector
Spaces', Fleming's 'Functions of
Several Variables', the math 
parts of von Neumann's 'Quantum
Mechanics', and much more, a big
stack more.<p>When I went for my Ph.D., what I
had learned before I entered was
nearly enough for the course work.
For the research, I brought my
own problem with me to graduate
school, had an intuitive solution
I'd worked out on an airplane 
flight, got enough math in my
first year to turn my intuitive
solution into some solid applied
math, later wrote some corresponding
illustrative software, and that
was my Ph.D. research.  For a 
Master's, there was a question in
a course without an answer.  I thought
for two weeks in the evenings and
saw a first solution and asked for
a 'reading course' to attack the problem.
When the course was approved, I gave
my first solution right away.  Two
weeks later I had a much nicer solution,
wrote it up, and that was the end of
the 'reading course' and the last I
needed for a Master's.  Later I published
the paper.  When I published I did some
more library work and discovered that I'd
invented a theorem comparable with the
classic Whitney extension theorem, that is,
H. Whitney long at Harvard.  I also 
discovered that I'd solved a problem
stated in the famous Arrow, Hurwicz,
Uzawa paper in mathematical economics.
So, that work I did in that 'reading
course' was publishable.<p>Eventually
I concluded that working the more
challenging exercises in the best
pure math texts -- Rudin, Halmos,
Royden, Neveu, etc., is good training
for doing original research.  Eventually I
discovered that if not afraid of 
being whacked in the neck with a bad
grade by a prof in a course, then 
usually can get what need for 
a given research problem from 
stacks of books and papers much
more quickly than the rate of
coverage in a course.<p>Eventually discovered a 'way'
to do research:  Do a lot of
intuitive guessing; then test
the intuitive guesses with 
some intuitive filters or
checking on special cases.<p>For a simple outline,
""Is A true?  Okay, likely
if A is true, then B is true.
Is it believable that B is 
true or would that be asking
too much?  Naw, likely B is
false.  So likely A is false.
So, check A on some simple
special cases.  Okay, still
A seems false.  So, try
C.  Is C true?  If C is
true, then likely D is true.
Okay, maybe D is true.  Check
out C on some simple special
cases.  C might be true!  So,
maybe try to prove C is true.
Now to prove C is true, likely
the proof has to make essential
use of all the hypotheses we
have for C, so in looking for
a proof, be sure can make good
use of all the hypotheses.
Else are trying to prove something
stronger than C which is likely
not true.  Now, if C is true,
just what, intuitively, is going
on?""<p>Can do a lot of this while 
writing little or nothing.
When the intuitive work seems
good, then try to write out
some actual math with careful
derivations, any new definitions
and then theorems and proofs.
If the intuitive guessing goes well,
then have a good shot of seeing
how to do the proofs right away.<p>Mostly don't write longer than trivial
algebraic derivations
without having a fairly good idea
what is going on intuitively.  That is,
mostly don't expect to get much just
from pushing symbols around.<p>In nearly all of K-12 and college, what
my wife did worked much better than what
I did.  For graduate work, a Ph.D.,
publishable original research, and
applications in a career, what I did
worked much better.",1367057232

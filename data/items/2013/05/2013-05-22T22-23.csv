In comparison, native devs had access to PIX for XBox 360 which reportedly offered near-VTUNE levels of insight into CPU and GPU performance.<p>Constraints are fine, of course, but most of XNA's problems were not active constraints but instead negligence - promises were constantly made and then broken, whether it was promising to fix serious issues or promising to pay devs on time for game purchases.",1369263220

At the same time, many of the Grooveshark engineers I know contributed to open-source projects in their free time.<p>The API has never allowed users to download songs, and it seems clear to me (by browsing the comments in the code on Github) that one element of the project in question performed that function.

There are no intermediate byte codes, no interpreter.""
<a href=""https://developers.google.com/v8/design#mach_code"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/v8/design#mach_code</a><p>Have a read about V8 and the DartVM's architecture. V8, and the DartVM have a different architecture than IE's Chakra and Firefox's monkeys. They use a method JIT which initially generates very simple native machine code directly from the AST. The machine code includes instructions to identify hot code, which is re-compiled again from the AST. The optimizing compiler converts the source into an SSA form, and IR, but this is not byte/bitcode. This is what Bak et al are referring to when they call this architecture a ""source code vm"".<p>Lars Bak on channel 9:
   Bytecodes are a silly thing in my mind.
   They can be used for different things interpretation. But interpreters are really slow.
   But they can also be used as a wire format, for instance in .net or java where that's what you ship over the wire.
   In javascript the wire format is sourcecode, and for each function you have, inside the running javascript program, you have to cook up the source code again. So that is the primary representation.
   So we just decided why not generate native code right away because the CPU is pretty fast.<p><a href=""http://media.ch9.ms/ch9/e6aa/354bf580-9c93-4383-bab3-cb6a3ddae6aa/GOTO12BakLuccoV8ChakraJSPerf.wmv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.ch9.ms/ch9/e6aa/354bf580-9c93-4383-bab3-cb6a3dd...</a>",1369262888

If all the JavaScript 'Ninjas' discover TypeScript and have the same reaction I just did, then Dart is going to struggle on the client because it doesn't operate well in the current JavaScript eco-system like TypeScript does.

However you must understand that the DMCA takedown procedure is not a human; it is a legal robot. By invoking DMCATakedownBot, they have not extended <i>you</i> proper courtesy, and probably the correct action is to file the counter-notification.<p>Your counter-notification can point out that the original legal letter to GitHub was largely not a 'notification of claimed infringement' under 17 USC  512 (c) (3) (A) [the ""safe harbor""/""takedown"" requirement of GitHub] -- because it claimed that the injury was a violation of 17 USC  1201, which is not about copyright infringement. You should point out that there <i>is</i> a claimed infringement in this notice -- ""He has taken proprietary source code from inside of our application"" -- but that this claimed infringement is outright false, you have not copied any source code from inside of their application. So the 'safe harbor' DMCA takedown notice ( 512) is probably not a proper venue for the legal discussion to occur. Rather, the proper venue is described in  1203; they should bring a civil action against you in a US district court for the actual damages and any additional profits of the violator, or statutory damages per violation.<p>You can then add to this notice something about how you'd much rather attempt to sort this out in a one-to-one discussion with the aggrieved programmers at the company, rather than in court.  You can also tell them that section 1203 (c) (5) allows a court to remit the total award of damages if you can prove to the court's satisfaction that you were not aware and had no reason to believe that your acts constituted a violation.<p>Since this is not legal advice so much as ""advice on what you can say to lawyers to get them off your back"", I will recommend that you read the relevant laws here:<p><a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17</a><p>I also recommend that if they do sue you under section 1203, you contact a lawyer.

For example, Albers' projection includes a latitude and longitude 'center'. So it would be better to change the latitude and longitude instead of the 2D window into the static projection. This would minimize the distortion when away from the natural projection center. The mercator doesn't have a natural center precisely because it's conformal, but other projections do.<p>If you already have the projection functions and their inverses, using automatic differentiation is the obvious choice. I think it might be simply a matter of computing the inverse projection's change in longitude and latitude respect to dx and dy, in pixels.

As long as I keep attempting to log in, you will be prevented from logging in since the latency to receive the SMS code is greater than the time it takes me to attempt another login, thereby invalidating the code that will be received.<p>Wow.<p>This also means that I can either a) flood you with text messages, or b) trip some threshold that will prevent Twitter from sending you text messages.

The issue is that:<p>1) Most of the time they don't know your real identity from your (e.g.) YouTube username. IIRC, you have to use your real name or contact information when filing a counter-notice.<p>2) If they sue you, the content stays up until they can convince the judge to order it to be taken down.<p>The point of the DMCA was to allow for things to be taken down quickly, and then sorted out in court later if need be. The content is taken down quickly. If you push back (counter-notice), then the (claimed) content owner has 10-14 days to start court proceedings to keep it down; otherwise, it goes back up. None of this precludes a suit being filed at any point.<p>The real issue with this process is that there is little relief for negligence in filing DMCA notices. All you have to do is have a good-faith belief that you are the content owner, and this violates your rights. So acting like you're ignorant of the law is actually a defence against being held accountable for filing a bogus notice.<p>If bogus DMCA notices were punished more often, and people were required to consult a lawyer before firing at the hip (e.g. people that don't understand copyright law, and just say, ""I don't like X take it down!

Even if Murdoch later succeeded in getting pricing flexibility from Apple at a subsequent date, it would be a pyrrhic victory, as many customers would have been trained on how to do it for free.<p>So HC had a lot to lose.

For the Javascript, you just need to add a new class to the text area. For the CSS, you need to make the '.fullscreen' class the following:<p><pre><code>    .fullscreen {
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
    }
</code></pre>
Now, this doesn't get you the little button in the upper right corner and the styling for the full screen textarea, but it is very functional, very configurable (just style with CSS), and quite small. Add a small button of your own and let the browser do all of the heavy work, by just adding a CSS class.<p>Oh, and this doesn't break Chrome/webkit's ability to resize the textarea when not in fullscreen mode...",1369260249

He's referring to valuation of the project in the sense that Google is worth $200b, not how much to charge customers of the application.<p>As for your strategy for deciding how much to charge (which is a different problem, again), there are two problems I see:<p>1. Users don't like when prices are gradually being hiked. There are subconscious effects like number-fixation (where people are attached to the first numbers they see), which causes them to perceive future prices as excessive, and there are conscious effects like the disdain of price hikes.<p>2. This strategy maximizes short-term revenue. There are other considerations which are more important, like profit (revenues minus costs)--with costs that are not purely fixed, maximizing revenue will not maximize how much money you make ultimately. Another consideration is the long term--charging less may cause faster adoption, which may be better for the long term.<p>You never want to be completely myopic in pricing unless you don't think there's a future to your app and you want to extract as much money as possible.",1300683234

I think obscurity of some forms, like using unusual port numbers, can be part of a defense-in-depth strategy to foil purely scripted attacks and save your resources a bit.<p>> .xxx just makes it easier for regulators/high-horse 'do-gooders' to target whole swathes of content...<p>And here we have it. It's a temptation I doubt they will be able to resist. Giving it to them that easily is just removing one more element of a defense-in-depth against censorship attempts.<p>> Why not have TLDs at all? Why not just have global content tags?<p>This is more of a technical issue, but my first reaction to doing everything via tagging is that spammers are going to spam: If you give them the opportunity to add tags to addresses you end up with the same scenario that lead Google to ignore keywords on websites.",1300680006

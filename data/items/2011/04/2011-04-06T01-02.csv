I truly did not expect to be one of the winners. My guess is that the YouTube API category had fewer entries than others.<p>Feel free to let me know what you think!<p>This was the challenge:<p><i>Wouldnt it be nice if you could create a video mash-up by chaining player invocations that work for both Flash and HTML5 videos ? Well, with the JavaScript API to the <iframe> embed we think you can.<p>Your task is to build a mash-up player using the <iframe> JavaScript API. You will be given a list of video IDs, and from-to timestamps. For example the following sequence (<xxasdadad, 65s, 95s>, <xxffwwe22, 20s, 35s>), which will trigger the mash-up player to play video with ID xxasdadad for 30 seconds, starting at second 65 and ending at second 95, then proceed to play video with ID xxffwwe22, starting at second 20 and ending at second 35.<p>Given the sequence, implement a player which will play the sections of the listed videos, starting at the from timestamp, and ending at the to timestamp for each video.<p>Try to make the transitions between videos as smooth as possible, and make it easy for users to embed your mash-up player in their own web applications.</i><p>I encourage everyone to enter this contest if they hold it again next year.

When I was working on a business with my friends, I'd only sleep for 4 hours or so a day. Whereas when I was working a job I hated, I was exhausted unless I slept 9-10 hours a night. I think sleep requirements are a function of brain activity and engagement. It's just a theory but it seems to be true, at least in my case. Another theory I have relates to the sleep schedules of people. I'm nocturnal. I have been since I was 8 years old. And when I was working with my friends, it was at night. So I wonder if nite people need more sleep to function during the day like morning people need more to work nights?",1302054666

In fact, Twitter has none of this kind of history period, so really, if you think about it, Twitter <i>should</i> think ""San Francisco"" is important. It's pretty much the only real history they have aside from the fail whale and Ashton Kutcher.

But a less obvious benefit is that it tilts the playing field so that merchants currently <i>based in CA</i> are better off (relative to itself without the tax) competitively. Additionally, companies that have avoided presence/nexus in California for the sole purpose of avoiding the tax will have less disincentives for avoiding California. As a result, perhaps more companies will open branches in California, either for sales, distribution, or development; and merchants already with presence in California will do relatively better than otherwise.<p>I can see why California would want to push for such a tax.",1302053291

On their scale, they can do a better job at spam fighting than I can with only access to my own mail streams. (But I can beat them for reliability.)<p>1) The 10 connection limit bites surprisingly early. Mail.app makes multiple connections, and if you leave a couple computers logged in, carry an iPhone, and maybe use an iPad you will find yourself randomly blocked from your email. (Their ""help""[1] article says you can reach the limit with as few as two sessions open.)<p>Google's solution is for you to remember to disconnect your computer from their IMAP servers when you are away.<p>2) IMAP searching is a mystery. I routinely have to use the web interface to search for things that I know are in my mail, but I can't find from Mail.app. I don't know who is at fault here.<p>3) I have instances of attachments becoming corrupted. Again, I can't conclusively place blame.<p>4) The strange organization issues from the ""tags"" vs. ""folders"" issues can be confusing to people that don't understand the nuts and bolts.<p>5) They have rather limited logging available. I recently had two laptops stolen which subsequently did IMAP updates while in possession of the parties unknown. Google's low granularity logging information (day and IP but no time information) caused trouble getting a court order to compel the ISP to produce the subscriber data. The court wants a specific time.<p>So there you have it. There are warts.

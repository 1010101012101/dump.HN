Once you've maxed out what they offer for MySQL and Postgres, what exactly are you supposed to do? Start using EC2 RDS?<p>Heroku seems to be like a more useful Google App Engine, a good place to host a blog or experimental project if you're not into dev-ops.<p>If you have a knack (at all) for dev-ops, you're not saving yourself anything.<p>The downtime is pretty bleh too. The moment you start doing multi-provider to offset this, you'll end up doing all the dev-ops work you would've had to have done before. Except now, you have to do it all at once in a time of what is probably high stress.<p>If you do the dev-ops/automation yourself from the start, you can start small/simple and grow that as you go, deploying your services to arbitrary hosting providers (EC2, Linode, dedicated boxes, whatever).<p>This is why whenever anybody asks me my opinion of Heroku, I respond, ""it's a great place to host that blog engine you wrote in Haskell/Clojure/{hipster_language_of_choice}"".",1346374639
4457680,comment,4455127,4455240,1,0,lutusp,,,"> I'd take issue with psychology not being a science.<p>Yep. It depends on how you define ""science"". If science means having a central corpus of theory that defines the field, informs research in the field, and regulates practice, as is true for physics, biology and every other scientific field, then psychology isn't a science.<p>If instead ""scientific"" means white lab coats and clipboards, and endless papers that are never replicated and that contradict each other, then psychology is a science.<p>If ""scientific"" means ignoring a field's reduction to practice, so that theory never informs clinical practice and anything goes in clinics, then yes, psychology is a science.<p>> ... Models of mental illness (depression, autism, schizophrenia etc) ...<p>Interesting you should mention autism. There is no clear definition of autism, no known cause, no clear diagnostic criteria, and no treatment. But that doesn't mean that psychologists don't diagnose and treat it -- of course they do. They just don't have any science to back up their practice.<p>Occasionally, an entire autism-spectrum disorder is simply abandoned, as is happening right now with Asperger's Syndrome. The reason? Clinical psychologists got carried away and began diagnosing nearly everyone who showed any apparent symptoms.<p>It's the same with depression -- a recent meta-analysis discovered that depression drugs don't actually work for most patients, and all the ""evidence"" that supports depression medications was cooked by vested interests.<p>As to schizophrenia, it's not a mental illness, it's a physical illness with genetic roots, an ailment that manifests severe psychological symptoms. Psychologists are reduced to treating the symptoms.<p>In medicine, if a ""doctor"" doesn't pay attention to medical research and evidence-based practice, he isn't allowed to practice because he represents a threat to public safety. In psychology, this simply isn't true. Professional organizations have repeatedly ruled that certain therapeutic practices are unscientific and invalid, and clinicians simply ignore them (examples include Facilitated Communications and Recovered Memory Therapy).<p>Medicine became respectable by stopping all unscientific clinical practice, and now any ""doctor"" who fails to meet present evidentiary standards is breaking the law. Psychology has yet to begin this process, and clinical practice is out of control.<p>Psychology have two choices:<p>1. Make clinical psychologists adopt evidence-based practice.<p>2. Make clinical psychologists stop calling themselves ""psychologists.""<p>There is no third choice.<p>> There's too much to mention really, and its an extremely important and relevant field.<p>It is a field that you do not understand.<p>More here: <a href=""http://arachnoid.com/trouble_with_psychology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/trouble_with_psychology</a>",1346374613

4457648,comment,4457314,4457409,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"<i>""What especially bothers me about this sort of trend is that it forces those of us who aren't big on bullshitting to do it anyway.""</i><p>I can't say I agree with this, the implication is that if you don't do it you will be harmed, which may be true in the short term but not in the long term [1]. I liked xo's reference to the worst argument in the world (<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/e95/the_worst_argument_in_the_world/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/e95/the_worst_argument_in_the_world/</a>) basically if you focus on the lying you miss the argument.<p>So when someone says ""How is your startup going?"" you provide the most positive answer you can come up with. This is a lie of omission if there are big clouds gathering over it, but if what you say is truthful then you've met the social obligation of responding. I've got a friend who is explicitly complete when you ask them how they are doing, with comments like ""well my hemorrhoids have flared up and all the fruit I ate gave me diarrhea so my arse is pretty painful at the moment.""  which people find a bit off putting. You don't have to be graphic like that of course and so if you're omitting details on the principle that this other person is just making 'small talk' then I would argue that is Ok.<p>Now if you have a potential investor ask you ""How is your startup going?"" and you say ""Great! Adding users like crazy, totally crushing it!"" when you know you won't make payroll next month if you don't get some more money in, that is lying with an intent to deceive the investor. The goal being to get them to invest before they really find out what is going on so that afterwards it will be fine. I've known people who do this, they rationalize it by thinking ""Lets assume this person has just invested the money I need, what would the status of my startup be <i>then</i>?"" and they answer that way, because that statement will be true in the future if they invest, and if they don't invest the startup will be dead anyway so who cares. But it robs the investor of the data they need to ask critical questions. It could be that the startup really does just need a bridge investment to cross the 'chasm' (in the Geoffrey Moore sense), but it also might mean there is fundamentally something wrong like a dysfunctional engineering or marketing team. This sort of 'loose relationship with reality' is just wrong.<p>So pulling it back to the 'forcing' thing, this behavior erodes trust. And in so doing puts folks who engage in it at a disadvantage against those who do not. So choosing not to engage may lose you a deal today, but longer term will make you more respected which will get your more business later. And the best thing about it is you don't have to keep remembering what you said to be sure and not contradict yourself.<p>[1] I get the point where you don't survive to the long term which is bad.",1346373942

As a result, Sony Xperia S has a higher PPI value than iPhone 4S but since it can't/doesn't market its display as retina, consumers may be misguided into thinking iPhone 4S has a sharper display. If we simply called them both ""high-PPI displays"", the consumer is more likely to become aware of the fact that retina is not a technology and it is trivial to determine which of these displays is sharper by simply comparing their PPI values.",1346371225

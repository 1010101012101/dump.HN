Are you talking about peer discovery?  Because DBus won&#x27;t help you there either--peers have to be aware of each other&#x27;s DBus object paths before they can rendezvous.

There are a ton of ways to skin this cat in userspace, depending on what your application needs.  Protobufs come to mind, for example, but there are others.<p>Why do you want the pipe to enforce a particular marshaling format?

Their dismal air safety record meant that there was much value in improving standards.<p>As part of this, they had a system that tracked the aircraft globally in real-time. I implemented part of the software for this. Aircrafts sent their GPS coordinates and basic telemetry every 45 seconds over Iridium. I got it in my servers a minute later.<p>If the aircraft position stopped being reported for ten minutes, or the system detected anomalous flying conditions (eg. Suspected crash), or the pilots pressed  a big red button, the system contacted a hierarchy of people by phone.

8353766,comment,8352260,8352260,6,0,srean,,,"Re-purposing and embellishing an old comment of mine:<p>Among all free diving warm blooded animals sperm whales go the deepest. They dive to depths 25 times deeper than their other equally famous and endangered cousin the blue whales.\nTo give an idea of how deep they dive, here is a picture <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/ESp2j.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/ESp2j.jpg</a> It needs to be magnified for perspective and for the little surprise at the bottom.<p>They are also fast divers/risers. It is interesting how they manage to hold their breath for so long and yet manage to survive the bends (decompression sickness. They do get bends related damage but they can survive it).<p>The whales are challenging our assumptions about animal intelligence, empathy, society, culture and language. For a long time we believed that the primates were at the top. Search Ted talks and youtube for dolphin intelligence, dont miss the Attenborough ones. For lack of a better word they are just amazing.<p>Dolphins are for example known to build difficult to make toys (air bubble vortex rings) just to entertain themselves.\nThey have to discover how to make it. Sometimes they can be quite possessive, they would break the toy if someone not so knowledgeable wants to play with it. Once a dolphin figures it out how to make one, his/her peers eventually figure it out as well. So it kind of spreads within a group like fashion, their version of the hula hoop.<p>This behavior has been observed both in captivity and in the wild. Dolphins in captivity try to imitate us and seem to have no trouble mapping our body parts to theirs.<p>A story goes that a scientist observing an young dolphin from an underwater portal had blown a cloud of cigarette smoke at it (on the human side of the glass). The dolphin promptly went to its mother and did the same to the scientist with dolphin milk ! Which BTW is almost as thick as tooth paste and is more squirted out than sucked.<p>It is now strongly believed that dolphins and killer whales call each other by name. Dolphins in captivity try to imitate human speech which takes enormous effort on their part because unlike for example parrots their vocal tract is not conducive for this at all. People believe this to be an indication of their strong desire to communicate with us.<p>And they originated from ungulates: hoofed warm blooded animals. It came as a surprise to me that that there were hoofed carnivorous animals.<p>@walterbell thats my favorite part of posting this.

I have five degrees including a PhD from an Ivy League school, I&#x27;ve been published in nature twice, Harvard Business Review, bla bla bla. All great on paper. But if you meet me in person, you&#x27;d never know that. I come across as a person of average intelligence (at best!), and I can tell you that I&#x27;ve always (at least at first) been treated like an outsider in high performing circles. I remember my second year of computer science when we had our first big group assignment, and no one wanted me in their group because they assumed I was a slacker of low average intelligence. Little did they know at the time that I was one of the top programmers in the class. Eventually everyone found out, and you know what, they liked me even more for it. But it&#x27;s an uphill battle whenever you are different.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not walking in your shoes. Maybe it would be the same, or maybe it would be 10x worse or 100x worse. What may help is two pieces of advice: (1) when you&#x27;re in high performing circles if you don&#x27;t talk and act like others in your group they&#x27;ll assume that you&#x27;re an outsider. Ironically, humans are simply not smart enough to look beyond the first set of superficial data points before they make a decision and so people react according to their experience. It may not be right, but it is. So if you&#x27;re entering a foreign group and you WANT to be accepted, then you&#x27;re going to need to act in a way that is familiar to them. (2) Something I heard once from Indra Nooyi: &quot;Always assume positive intent&quot;. That is, sometimes people think negatively about us, and sometimes we read into things. If you think that people have good intentions then try to make the second your null hypothesis. Even if you&#x27;re wrong you may win some of these people over, and when you&#x27;re right you may give people important benefit of the doubt.",1411439500

The second part of the win for Adobe, is they can now slather the Adobe brand, all over where the Aviary brand is now prominent, in those partnerships.

Even in the sense that randomness is deterministic, it&#x27;s then part of fate which is ruled by whatever supreme power you would believe in. As Luke says in The Dice Man, if &quot;not a single sparrow can fall to the ground without your Father knowing it&quot;, then how can a die tumble without his knowing it? A die is just as pseudo-random of course, but it&#x27;s nigh impossible to have a &quot;seed&quot; of the exact hand movement and height you use, the surface and the form of the die.<p>I&#x27;m an atheist, but I do find the concept of randomness being the pure will of god fascinating.",1411437860

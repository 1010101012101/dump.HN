Not if you have an impressive rsum, not if you make a lot of money. Not even if your stuff is really technically impressive or shows off IQ or promise.<p>Really, that&#x27;s important. There&#x27;s a lot on this site about being the cleverest, the fastest, knowing more comp sci than the next person or handling trickier interviews or proving there&#x27;s something wrong with some other ecosystem, program, language, etc. Sometimes I&#x27;m not sure everyone feels they have a job to do that can improve people&#x27;s lives.<p>Whether sideprojects can sometimes help you reach career goals is a more appropriate question. For applicants I think there&#x27;s an initial threshold of whether they can ship nontrivial stuff. They can demonstrate it with their past jobs or by actually building stuff. A sideproject could certainly help you get hired if you have no experience and the credentials aren&#x27;t getting you there; it might be smart to do if you&#x27;re having trouble finding right work out of college, say. Likewise, it might help you show you have potential in a radically different specialty that your past experience has no bearing on (e.g., you used to write Ruby on Rails but want start to writing code for microcontrollers).<p>And if someone has unrealistic expectations about how much of a rockstar you need to be, maybe you don&#x27;t want to work for them.

It certainly seems that we have different kinds of interviews in mind. I&#x27;m referring to about an hour long session where a candidate is asked to solve a basic problem with a linked list. The candidate shouldn&#x27;t be expected to have the algorithm memorized. Competent developers should be able to work out simple algorithms manipulating a linked list given an hour&#x27;s time.<p>> you look it up or grab it from a library instead of writing a busted implementation yourself.<p>Usually. Sometimes there is no library. The point is the candidate should be able to write the library themselves if needed. The beauty of many linked list questions is that no reference is needed to work out the optimal answer (Flynn&#x27;s algorithm being a notable exception).<p>> There are lots of ways to evaluate critical thinking and problem solving skills that don&#x27;t rely on a candidate having memorized the contents of a CS textbook.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t think that linked list traversal and reversal require some kind of arcane CS knowledge. Interviewers shouldn&#x27;t be asking for e.g. on-the-spot implementations of Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm, the Hindley-Milner type inference system or the max-flow problem.<p>> A better interview question is one that focuses on solving a real problem for a hypothetical customer, because that&#x27;s what most engineers actually get paid to do.<p>This is a good complement to a basic algorithmic / coding test.

Attacking politics directly (i.e. more politics) will do what it always did - that is, nothing.<p>Politics of all kind has two ultimate goals - to keep (and gain more) power and to keep (and gain more) riches. In western democracies this corresponds to being popular (thus maximizing the chance of reelection) and passing laws in favour of those with money, respectively. All the political discussion on top of it seems to be nothing more than something to keep people busy.<p>I think that&#x27;s why many here think about technological solutions first - they have direct effects and are bullshit free. But as many noted, just technological is not enough. Technology is just a tool. What we need to do is to hit the popularity and the money angle, which means a) PR solutions and b) business solutions.<p>I have a feeling that people want to see only purely technological and political solutions because neither cost that people money personally. It&#x27;s one thing to run away from Google services; it&#x27;s another to say to client, &quot;we won&#x27;t work with you because of your privacy practices&quot;. It&#x27;s hard to notice financial decisions we could make, because they&#x27;ll hurt us personally in short term.<p>No political change will be introduced by few individuals; that&#x27;s why we are all encouraged to take action. But I propose that if, instead or along with, we all take the business angle and refuse to give money to people destroying the Internet and our civilization, much more will be achieved.<p>ETA: there&#x27;s a quote from pg&#x27;s &quot;The Acceleration of Addictiveness&quot; [0] I particularly like:<p><i>As knowledge spread about the dangers of smoking, customs changed. In the last 20 years, smoking has been transformed from something that seemed totally normal into a rather seedy habit: from something movie stars did in publicity shots to something small huddles of addicts do outside the doors of office buildings. A lot of the change was due to legislation, of course, but the legislation couldn&#x27;t have happened if customs hadn&#x27;t already changed.</i><p>Note the last sentence.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html</a>",1377030871

You have to remember: you may feel that the NSA has violated your privacy, but they are also the organization responsible for protecting it from other nations.<p>But peacetime makes us quick to forget these events. The Google-hack event was only 2 years ago, the Nasdaq hack is currently ongoing, the RSA hack was in 2011. Someone hacked Verisign in 2012. All are being treated as international hacking events.<p>The balance of &quot;privacy&quot; and &quot;security&quot; is more complicated than &quot;destroy that program&quot; or &quot;remove funding&quot; from a certain agency. Overreactions happen both in peacetime and wartime. Now, more than ever, as other countries spy on Americans, is the time for agencies like the NSA to step up and help defend.<p>You see how easy it is to turn an argument into anything?

6246340,comment,6244577,6245068,1,0,gotrythis,,,"I just asked a contact who works at ClickBank.  He said it depends on if it is a fairly competitive niche or something less mainstream, and if it is is fairly competitive, it will get lost among all the other products in a big niche, as people only look at the first couple of pages of results when looking for products.  The main takeaway is that there is &quot;basically a zero chance it will just get found and picked up by affiliates without an affiliate recruitment strategy.&quot;<p>He also agrees that &quot;someone asking for 50% is WAY too high&quot; (his caps) and agrees that 10% is more like it, though many affiliate managers also look for a flat fee in case the product doesn&#x27;t take off, so there is that risk to keep in mind - though it still doesn&#x27;t seem right.<p>Here&#x27;s some things to consider:<p>1) How long do they get 50% of sales?  Forever?  Do they keep recruiting forever too?  Put a time-limit on this, or an income cap so you can build your business later.<p>2) Make sure that it&#x27;s a percentage of sales AFTER commissions, not before.  So, like 50% of the sale goes to affiliates, 10% to the affiliate manager, 40% to you, out of which you pay processing costs, etc.  Perhaps negotiate it to be after costs as well.<p>Finding an affiliate manager is hard as they are in demand if they are any good.  And what you described is the bare minimum job an affiliate manager does for 10%, though if you can&#x27;t find anyone else, and they make the difference between success and failure, 50% of something is much better than 0% of nothing.<p>The short answer is you&#x27;ll need some way of driving traffic and affiliate marketing is an incredible way to do get quality, warm leads delivered to your site in a hurry.  However, good affiliates often/should want to know how well your site converts before sending traffic, so they don&#x27;t waste an opportunity to sell something else to their list or otherwise don&#x27;t waste their time, which means finding a way to test it first - like as you planned with adwords.<p>I could go on about the right way to go about things for hours, but hopefully this is somewhat helpful.  If you want to find another affiliate manager, network at Internet marketing conferences.",1377030677

The highest earning programmers I know have never heard of github and would never consider using it.<p>Honestly edw519 you are being pedantic. The highest earning programmers I know made billions of dollars starting a company and now no longer program. The outliers don&#x27;t matter because most people are not competent enough to be an outlier. And that is ok. It is OK to &quot;just&quot; earn $200k / year at 27 years old working a 8/9 to 5 job. If someone follows my advice, they can easily achieve that if they want to.<p>> You will be a better developer if you deliver more. &quot;More languages, tools, people, and ideas&quot; can just as easily dilute your focus as improve your skill. To get better, you must focus on results, not activity.<p>I completely disagree. I hand rolled ASP (pre .net) code for 4 years manually stitching things together. No. Production on its own once you stopped learning doesn&#x27;t matter to your personal development. I became much more productive once I switched to Ruby/Python.<p>Results mean coding up another pricing page for yet another A/B test.<p>> Why do you assume these 2 are mutually exclusive? I know lots of excellent programmers who deliver more before noon than most deliver all week. Nothing wrong with being excellent during working hours and doing something else in your spare time, like perhaps, enjoying your spare time.<p>Why do you assume that I assume that they are mutually exclusive? I said essentially &quot;If X and Y then Z&quot; someone could code in their spare time, and be happy where they are (coding is self fulfilling for its own sake). But if someone is not happy where they are, and they are not coding outside of work then I think they should start coding after work. This is not exactly a ground breaking opinion. If you are sick of working at a souless jquery job, learn a more productive language on the side and get moving.<p>> If you want to be a better developer more than anything, then you should deliver production quality software. Sometimes the &quot;blocker&quot; is a distraction. Distractions can be other things that masquerade as &quot;side work&quot;.<p>I agree that this <i>could</i> happen, but more often the opposite thing happens. People come to work, check out, and slowly stop caring about learning because every day they are doing the same thing and working on small problems that don&#x27;t really matter (like making a stupid parallax effect because the marketing guy wants it). Usually people could be more productive and be paid more if they understood more productive technologies.<p>> Personally, I never show code samples.<p>Well ok. Put yourself in my position. You get 1000 resumes a week and 58% of people exaggerate or outright lie (I know MySQL, can&#x27;t do a basic join clause) and 40% are completely unqualified. Now, I put in a very basic requirement. Send me code sample or a link to your github. 100 resumes, half of which have horrible, horrible, horrible code. 45 of which have decent, but not amazing code, and 5 of which have outstanding code.<p>I&#x27;ve yet to interview someone that had amazing code and turn them down for the job. I went from rejecting 8 or 9 out of 10 people in an interview to 1 or 2 out of 10 (depending on the position).<p>Code isn&#x27;t underwear. Code is a product. You don&#x27;t hire photographers for your wedding without seeing their work. You don&#x27;t give production keys to people that don&#x27;t know what a hash table is. It is that simple. Not my loss.

This is not the user experience they get on Facebook, when you generally have &quot;friends&quot; right away and are able to &quot;Like&quot; and communicate with them right off the bat.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the answer to this Twitter problem is, just noting that there&#x27;s huge room for improvement in that aspect of onboarding.",1377030575

US is unique in this regard as it was founded by people who actually thought about this question a lot - unlike most of other countries - and made a set of documents available - including, obviously, the Constitution, but also other works - that explain what they thought and why. But it is only a set of texts, each person has to find for himself/herself where their basic principles are and why the law must be such and not other. If the law has no basis under it, then what you feel is inevitable - since the law can be taken from you and perverted and made to say whatever people in power want it to say - and if you don&#x27;t know what is beyond the law you have nothing left.

I don&#x27;t believe that these are productive discussions.</i><p>It&#x27;s not aligning yourself with government, it&#x27;s begging your masters to throw you a bone. What kind of incentive do you think a protest creates? Would politicians suddenly shut down all surveillance  programs simply because people on the streets are protesting? If you were a politician, would you? Not likely. You&#x27;re already elected, you&#x27;re paid and you have private interests at your back who DO pay you money that directly depend on your ability to pass laws in favor of those interests. The best a protest can do is to incentivize government to create an appearance of change.<p>Look at history. Protest rarely solved anything. They either transformed into bloody revolutions (which didn&#x27;t do any good either) or were largely ignored. No, you don&#x27;t need to protest. You need to ignore the government as much as you can and tell others to. Use Bitcoin instead of govt currency and don&#x27;t pay them a cut in the form of taxes, use Bitmessage instead of email, use VPN and TOR, don&#x27;t send your children to school where they are indoctrinated. And never ever vote. Voting is begging your masters. Have some pride.",1377029156

However - and unfortunately - WinJS doesn&#x27;t work on the web since it tries to call WinRT APIs which it doesn&#x27;t have permission to use.

That meant I lost things like saved games and high scores since I used WinJS data binding to implement them.

Instead, they&#x27;d take a different approach: in addition to trying to match interviewers with candidates, they would also perform analysis on interviewer&#x27;s previous feedback (e.g., are they constantly voting down candidates that go on to receive an offer after additional review, or vice-versa?) and weigh the feedback accordingly.<p>I&#x27;d be highly surprised if Google doesn&#x27;t do this.<p>I do agree that usual &quot;watch an experienced candidate do the interviews&quot; approach to training is insufficient: this is much like expecting one to become a better candidate by watching a strong quickly &quot;get&quot; an algorithmic question with an a-ha insight, it looks easy when you already know the answer. I love the anagrams example from Programming Pearls -- it appears as &quot;aha&quot; problem, seems obvious to those who already know the answer -- but the book describes in detail on how it represents an entire class of problems and how to achieve that seeming insight using a more structured approach.<p>As an aside I actually finding interviewing others to be much harder than being interviewed myself -- if I screw up as a candidate worst thing that can happen is I don&#x27;t get an offer, if I screw up as an interviewer people other than myself (the candidate, the company) will be affected.

9060735,comment,9060010,9060479,0,0,kastnerkyle,,,"Both of these ideas (word2vec and DeepWalk) are largely based on the idea of low level embeddings as you mention. A great paper on learning embeddings for sparse representations is a paper by Yoshua Bengio et. al. &quot;A Neural Probabilistic Language Model&quot;[1]. Chris Olah gives a great introduction and summary here [2]. If a problem can be reformulated into words or a random walk on a graph, these methods provide a powerful, direct way to feed into a neural network and also visualize and interpret the learned representation. It is pretty cool!<p>Since these are random walks, it seems unlikely that something as simple as vector math in the embedding space will emerge. However, I wonder if these embedding spaces could contain much more complex relationships than the simple eigenvector based methods typically used for characterizing graph Laplacian type  matrices, since the embedding is a non-linear decomposition of this matrix. Smarter PageRank, anyone? Maybe even graph translation (translating the connections in one large social graph to condition the information in another smaller network, or vice versa), though I have been fuzzy on formulating the details.<p>[1] <a href=""http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/BengioDVJ03.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/Bengio...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representation...</a>",1424149114

For others, incorporating more advanced mathematical constructs. And for a third group, learning how to design a certain category of applications really well.<p>To round yourself out means not to stay within your comfort zone, but to attack the missing parts as well so that even if you aren&#x27;t a master at those, you have working knowledge. This is also familiar to those who have studied drawing or playing musical instruments - there are many cases where you can get by with what you already know, but would do better if you took the time to study a technique in detail.<p>When Hickey says &quot;you reset from zero&quot; by only doing new things, he&#x27;s specifically referring to repetitively relearning basic tasks in software development. That&#x27;s the stuff that you&#x27;re guided into looking at constantly because there are slick presentations and hypemen trying to get you to pick up their tool, and their tool has to look easier(i.e. more basic) than the other tool because that&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;ll pay attention to it.<p>If your approach involves something that is kind of challenging that you build from scratch, with new domain problems, that is a Good Thing and you&#x27;ll surely get something out of it.",1424148840

9060715,comment,9060227,9060227,0,0,angersock,,,"So, there&#x27;s a great argument to be made about the negative impacts of &quot;Shipping Culture&quot;.<p>One could argue that it encourages underdesigning of ultimately complex systems. One could argue that it encourages excessive code and infratstructure reuse, to the point that even trivial projects pull in more than is needed and consume more resources than even remotely necessary. One could even argue that it creates in customers an unreasonable expectation about ongoing fixes to a project, about ongoing support contracts and culture, and generally discourages creating artifacts that later generations can use in favor of ongoing maintenance performed by morlocks.<p>Sadly, the author makes none of those arguments, and instead gripes about hackathons, about Javascript (badly), and about MongoDB (which is fun, but doesn&#x27;t go anywhere).<p>Author bemoans &quot;ship it now&quot; culture, bemoans shipping things before they&#x27;re technically good--and then has the gal to use a Netscape Navigator screenshot! Does anyone else find irony in that? Netscape was never known for good quality code or sane implementations--go read old kvetching by Brendan Eich or Jamie Zawinski. You know what they <i>did</i> do, though? Fucking shipped.<p>Author complains about NaN--which is a goddamn <i>standard</i> in IEEE 754, which is exactly how C++ (their pet language) handles things, and which is completely reasonable behavior for any JS implementation. Not having an integer type? Newsflash kid: JS supports bit-accurate integers up to Int32s.<p>Author claims systems stopped using coopterative multitasking two decades ago. Author has presumably never written code for hard-real-time embedded systems.<p>Author goes on to complain about ancient standards. I have an ancient 120v 60-hertz AC circuit running my house. I have an ancient system of measurement for the beer on my desk. Funny thing about ancient systems: <i>if they&#x27;re still around, it&#x27;s because they&#x27;ve perhaps solved the problem well enough to stay around</i>.<p>&quot;Shipping Culture&quot;, as defined by the author, isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s hurting us: it&#x27;s the influx of jackasses with loud mouths and no appreciation for history, business, or engineering loudly proclaiming that perhaps the most productive decade in software engineering is somehow wrong.",1424148554

So I went out and bought one full price. Switching from the DeathAdder 2013 I immediately noticed a few differences:<p>* Friction of movement was higher and &quot;stickier&quot; regardless of surface.\n* Grip was less comfortable because I had to push my fingers against the top edge.\n* Cursor motion was noticeably lagged and jerky. Admittedly this is going from a corded gaming mouse to a bluetooth mouse, but I don&#x27;t care. I didn&#x27;t want cordless anyway.<p>My only problem with the DeathAdder is that the Mac drivers are horrifically bad and the third party alternatives (SteerMouse etc) aren&#x27;t much better. I&#x27;ve found that I can configure some settings on a Windows box which configure firmware in the mouse itself (mostly DPI modes and disabling the lights).

We published\na stack of papers; I was one of three\nof us that gave a paper at an AAAI IAAI\nconference at Stanford.  My view of the\ngood papers at that conference was that\nthey were just good computer-aided\nproblem solving as in applied math,\napplied science, and engineering and\nowed essentially nothing to AI.\nLater I took one of our major\nproblems we were trying to solve\nwith AI, stirred up some new\nstuff in mathematical statistics,\ngot a much better solution (and\ndid publish the paper in\n<i>Information Sciences</i>).\nThat experience\nand observation since is the support for\nmy claim.  Sure, this support is just\nmy opinion, and YMMV.<p>Instead of AI with a lot of economic value, \nI would suggest that \ncloser in is a scenario of\npeople managing computers managing computers ...\nmanaging computers doing the work.<p>And what work will those computers do?\nSure, first cut, the usual -- food,\nclothing, shelter, transportation,\neducation, medical care.<p>So,\nmaybe John Deere will have a <i>worker</i>\ncomputer on a tractor doing the spring\nplowing, the summer cultivating, and\nthe fall harvesting.  Then food can\nget cheaper.  Maybe before the\nplowing a tractor will traverse the\nground, take an analyze soil samples\nfor each, say, square yard, and \napply appropriate chemicals.<p>Maybe GM will have car factories with\nrobots driven by computers doing essentially\nall the work.  Then cars can get cheaper.<p>Maybe Weyerhaeuser or Toll Brothers \nwill have pre-fab house factories\nwith robots driven by computers doing\nessentially all the work,\nself-driving trucks delivering the\nbig boxes, computer driven earth\nmovers doing the site preparation,\ncomputer driven robots putting up the\nforms for the concrete basement \nwalls, computer driven \nconcrete pumpers inserting the\nconcrete from self-driving\nconcrete trucks,\nand houses will get a lot cheaper.<p>And the computers get cheaper.<p>So, right, we&#x27;re talking deflation.\nSo, have the government print\nsome money and spend it on\nK-12 and college education,\nguaranteed annual income,\nparks, beautiful highways,\netc.  Print enough money\nto reverse the deflation\nand hire a lot of people.\nThose people buy the\ncheap food, cars, and houses,\nhave children, and fill the\nclassrooms of the \nadditional education.<p>What education?  Sure:  How the\nheck to develop all those\nrobots, managing computers, worker computers, computer\ndriven farm machinery,\ncar factories,\npre-fab house factories,\netc.<p>Or, as computers eliminate jobs,\nbasically the result is deflation,\nand that&#x27;s the easiest thing\nin the world to stop, and the\nsolution is the nicest thing\nin the world --\njust print money to get us\nout of deflation.<p>We already know what people want\nfrom the famous one word\nanswer &quot;More&quot;.<p>Computers should be a blessing,\nnot a curse.",1424146801

A more important reason is the tools are good enough (only just, but that&#x27;s enough) and at that point priorities change. And once momentum becomes big it&#x27;s hard to change direction i.e. Javascript, so hard to revisit the fundamentals.<p>Better tools are coming, such as Lighttable / Bret Victor&#x27;s talk: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/71278954"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/71278954</a> .

If your problems are essentially trivial and you are just trying to gauge customer moods, shipping and shipping again quickly is the way to go...and thinking about the problem will probably not help.<p>However, while quick iterations converge rapidly on a local maximum, they really, really suck at getting you out of that local maximum.<p>I notice this with trying to create a new and different programming language (<a href=""http://objective.st"" rel=""nofollow"">http://objective.st</a>):  for almost all the problems I am tackling, there are quick and obvious answers...that get me stuck in the same mess we are already in.

One thing to think about though (which I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re already very aware of) is that lack of money a startup might have, and the prohibitively expensive process of filing for a patent.<p>This is a question a lot of startups have to make. Should I protect my product for what could cost over $10k, or should I use that $10k to put into marketing, or focus being the first to market with my product, or any other of the 100 things a startup company may want to do.<p>Obviously you wouldn&#x27;t _just_ do patents. It&#x27;s just something I&#x27;ve seen people think about and just say &quot;nah, not worth it for the money&quot;, especially when you couple that with the risk of finding your idea is totally no novel or inventive after spending $2k just on your first search.",1424145672

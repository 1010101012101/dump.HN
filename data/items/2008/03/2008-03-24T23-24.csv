What I mean is, if you change the neighborhood in which he lives but he himself doesn't change at all, he'll be just in as bad a position <i>relatively to the other kids</i>.<p>Let's say Billy has a GetsInTrouble factor and the neighborhood has a Violence factor. If Billy still has a GetsInTrouble factor of 8/10 but gets into a neighborhood with 1/10, of course he'll be far better off. But he could take matters in his own hands and try to lower his GetsInTrouble factor; taking an assuming posture towards the situation would already be a great first step.<p>Changing himself would be far more effective than trying to change his environment or worse, letting his mother or other intervenants try.<p>edit: By the way, I'm not saying that changing his violent environment is not a worthwhile goal. Just that he shouldn't count on it much. If he doesn't count on it, his situation will be better whether the environment change happens or not. But if he counts on it, he's just denying responsibility again and that won't protect him if he ever relocates or if the environment changes again.",1206403177

145188,comment,145020,145020,0,0,pdorrell,,,"The analogy that this parody depends on is a very weak one, because PG's point is that the modern job in the modern company did not exist when we were hunter-gatherers, i.e. any time prior to the invention of modern agriculture.<p>Marriage, on the other hand, is the result of an intrinsic human tendency to form long-term relationships and raise children within those relationships. This tendency has probably existed for longer than the ""modern"" human species (the major evidence for this, as I remember, is the similarity between male and female size, and the fact that human monogamy is determined by the combination of helplessness and large size of the new-born infant, so that the mother requires major help from the father in order to raise her child successfully).<p>Modern civilisation has not done anything to prevent men and women getting together the way they always have, and it has had limited success in providing ""artificial"" alternatives.",1206402867

145183,comment,144097,144097,0,0,rcoder,,,"There have been a number of good app-specific recommendations below, but I think there are some more general things to keep in mind, too:<p>#1: Keep your system up-to-date. Your most likely entry vector is a perfectly legitimate service like Apache or OpenSSH (or even worse, some PHP application) being cracked 'cause you never installed a critical security patch.<p>#2: Run different services as different users. There's no reason for your Mongrel listeners, cron jobs, reverse proxy, and god knows what else to run as the same user. Basic uid/gid partitioning is at the core of good POSIX security.<p>#3: Never, ever trust a public web application or server with total access to your data. Use your database server's access controls to limit admin-level access, and consider running your load balancer, public applications, and admin tools on separate hosts.<p>#4: Find ways to prevent password storage, entry, and checking on your application servers. Read up on and understand Kerberos, even if you aren't going to use it: it's the industry standard for an authentication system that doesn't require clients to expose their password to servers.",1206402534

I don't know why, and your guess is as good as mine. My impression is that, in Digg's case, they tended to play up the gaming aspect early on -- e.g. they put up huge banners trumpeting the number of diggs for each article -- and built their audience out of people who think that competing to push articles up the leaderboard is a fun sport.

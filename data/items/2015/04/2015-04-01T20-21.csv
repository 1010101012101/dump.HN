9306839,comment,9306085,9306490,0,0,erispoe,,,"Yes, many crops use more water than Almonds, but the main problems with almond trees is that they&#x27;re slow to grow and you need to water them at all times, even in a severe drought. With seasonal crops, you have the option to switch to maybe less profitable but less demanding crops, or to lie fields fallow.<p>What we need in California is not necessarily crops that demand less water, because some years we have plenty of water, what we need is adaptability.

9306837,comment,9306036,9306653,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Unfortunately, it will probably follow standard European practice.<p>Those responsible for making policy at international levels are often sufficiently removed from democratic accountability as to be effectively immune from any personal consequences whatever their actions.<p>National governments can argue that their hands are tied by international agreements that they cannot unilaterally violate, and therefore they are compelled to implement those international policies at home.<p>The same national governments may in fact have been responsible for voting on or outright appointing the relevant international policy-makers. However, media coverage and public debate rarely explore or challenge these processes.<p>It appears that this set-up can last indefinitely, until something very bad happens. Of course, some very bad things <i>have</i> happened in Europe in recent years, and national politicians are a lot more careful about expressing their support for EU and Eurozone policies than they used to be.",1427921922

The combination doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of case law at the Supreme Court level. It may well be the case that a coordinated change in both federal and state (statutory) law would be enough to work around the takings clause issue.<p>Even if all else failed it might well be better to bite the rentier tax once than to live with them forever.

My point is that this is part of a bigger pattern of &quot;power dynamics.&quot; For example the urban middle class engages in a kind of self-congratulatory mode by observing such rituals as Earth Hour, while at the same time condemning the intransigence of poor communities who refuse to be displaced for the sake of the country, the planet, etc. No one dare even suggest that the economic rewards of cheaper energy be allocated in further promotion of environmental protection measures, or God forbid, compensation for the displaced, instead of fueling an imminent manifestation of Jevons Paradox, which would obliterate the thinly argued benefits of e.g. a hydropower project.

At the end of the day you need to convince city officials to spend what little money they have remaining in their budget on your new system because it offers a greater value than all of their other proposed upgrades to the city AND that what you have is as reliable or better than the current system they have in place. This means asking them to trust a small company they&#x27;ve never heard of to manage the transit systems for their city and potentially drop contracts with companies that they have been working with for a very long time (remember this is politics). Also keep in mind that software or hardware failure in these systems could result in multiple fatalities. I&#x27;m not trying to be a naysayer, it&#x27;s just important to recognize that getting something like this implemented is not as easy as convincing consumers to try/buy your product.<p>The best bet would probably be to get a forward-thinking city to experiment with this in a small area and then go from there.",1427921709

I&#x27;ll assume they&#x27;re honest, for purposes of explaining why I don&#x27;t find the Booz Allen job so damning.<p>So, he&#x27;s made a decent case that taking the Booz Allen Hamilton job, while driven by admitted &quot;ulterior&quot; motive, wasn&#x27;t merely &quot;I&#x27;ll have a peek at secret info and see who I can &#x27;sell&#x27; it to later&quot;.  He already had some ideas what was wrong and who he wanted to tell about it.  Now, I will grant you that his perception of the documents he gathered to support his opinion was then biased, and that the collection of documents available biases what they can be used to claim.  But that seems an unavoidable part of humans forming and expressing opinions.  So long as his &quot;opinion&quot; wasn&#x27;t formed based on what would &quot;play well&quot; in the media or something like that, I don&#x27;t really see an issue here.<p>If I haven&#x27;t beaten this to death, another way to say what I&#x27;m trying to say here: imagine he worked in the same place for 5 years, and then in the last 3 months decided to start actively gathering documents to support a thesis.  Would you say that skewed his results the same way?  Why or why not?   Because arguably, he did work in the same environment for 5+ years, and I don&#x27;t see why just switching to another defense contractor for access poisons any opinion-forming or research he does there.  If it does, we have to distrust anybody who has ever acted on an opinion in order to persuade us of it, because that means anything they say is skewed and they are now trying to fit facts into their narrative instead of the other way around.  (Which is probably a good way to lean toward, but not very helpful if you take it to an extreme and want to ever learn about things that happen outside of your immediate consciousness.)<p>> is he a disgruntled ex-employee trying to lash out at his former employer<p>But it only became his former employer by Snowden&#x27;s own choice to leak, as far as I understand both Snowden and the government say.  Are you saying he now regrets losing his cushy $122k/yr job with Booz Allen, so we can&#x27;t trust him?  That&#x27;s a stretch IMO -- the documents were obtained before his employer became the ex-employer, so they can&#x27;t inherently be tainted afterward.  And at this point, it&#x27;s probably mostly the journalists picking through the documents and potentially coming up with misleading excerpts and framing, but why would their reason to do so be to spite their source&#x27;s ex-employer?  Snowden might be a naive idealist, an attention seeker, a troll, a spy, or something else, but &quot;disgruntled ex-employee&quot; is not making any sense to me.  Maybe I&#x27;m taking it differently than you meant.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2014/05/edward-snowden-politics-interview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2014/05/edward-snowd...</a>",1427921510

In Santa Cruz there is a fixed fee for water delivery based on the size of the pipe (fee is independent of how much water you consume), a tiered fee based on consumption, and another fee for wastewater that is fixed tied to the household.<p>The fixed fees are very high.  If I halved my water consumption then it would only save a dollar or so a month.  The net effect is that the people who consume the least pay the most for the water they consume because of the high fixed fees.  Here is my municipal bill for June last year:<p><pre><code>    17.41 Water - Ready to Serve 5/8&quot;

Wouldn&#x27;t a bad community or developer become evident when you started looking around at how to help and contribute to the project?<p>Just recently I decided I was bored with my routine at home and wanted to challenge myself. So I set a task: pick a public repo that I don&#x27;t already maintain (preferably that I use), find a bug I would like to see fixed (emphasis on would like to see the bug fixed), and to fix it.<p>I ended up choosing a program that I use but is written in a language I&#x27;m not familiar with. Regardless, I jumped right in.<p>First I looked around for any mailing lists or chat rooms where development discussion is carried out. I joined and asked how I can help, and was directed to the bug tracker and told to go nuts. I can see how this can be a daunting task, but I found the easiest way forward is to put those feelings of being overwhelmed aside and to just start. I cloned the repo and grepped for a tag I hoped would get me to the code I needed, luckily it was a good guess.<p>I spent the weekend reading the code for no less than three different projects and learning a lot about erlang, and by yesterday evening I had a patch created and a pull request submitted. And I feel fantastic for it and am looking forward to setting a similar challenge next weekend.<p>My point is that I think part of looking around the project and bug tracker should help you figure out what the attitude of the Dev team is like. I don&#x27;t doubt there are sour devs our there but IMO they are few and far between, more likely is the unresponsive maintainer who lost interest in the project but still has the keys to the kingdom.<p>What&#x27;s the worst case scenario? You create a patch and the project maintainer refuses to merge it? If he doesn&#x27;t provide good reasons for not wanting to merge it, he looks bad. If he says your code quality needs improvement you can ask for specifics and learn some new tricks. If he says he just doesn&#x27;t want that feature then leave your code up on github and see if other people start advocating for having your issue merged.

Otherwise, it&#x27;s rather dismissive. That seems to be a side effect of headline fads along the lines of &quot;studies show X is bad/has no benefit&quot; or &quot;studies show X is good for you!&quot; The best answer, of course, is &quot;we need more data.&quot;<p>However, I did find this gem buried quite a ways down toward the end of the article:<p>> Dr. JoAnn Manson, the chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said the large clinical trials of fish oil focused only on people who already had heart disease or were at very high risk.<p>If that&#x27;s true, then it appears TFA is looking at it from the wrong angle. In other words, fish oils may have no effect on someone who&#x27;s already suffered from a heart attack (or is at high risk), but someone who is aiming to use it as a preventative treatment might reduce their risk. Should this be the case, studying at risk populations who may have already had heart problems might not be the best starting point. It&#x27;s a bit like fretting over a nutritious diet and plenty of fluids being of little use for someone who already has the flu, regardless of how poor their diet was prior.<p>On the other hand, jimrandomh [1] near the top of these comments links to the study and warns there may be something more at work here. This is in the thread where magic5227 points out a comment on the NYT article that the statistical work in the study raises some considerable questions because it may have established too high a burden of proof. jimrandomh&#x27;s comment suggests otherwise. So, who knows. It&#x27;s worth reading through that thread as well.<p>Personally, I think the truth is probably somewhere between these two extremes. It&#x27;s apparently clear the Inuit&#x27;s diet has influence on their cardiac health, but is it <i>really</i> just the omega-3s and not the wider range of benefits from <i>eating</i> fish? Or is it possibly tied to a <i>lifetime</i> of omega-3 intake rather than starting supplementation on a whim or only after serious health problems? If that&#x27;s the case, shouldn&#x27;t long-term supplementation (on the order of decades) be a focus of study instead? (Note: I have never followed fish oil studies, nor do I take it, so perhaps someone will be kind enough to link to such a study.)<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m no nutritionist, and I&#x27;m kind of an idiot, but it seems to me that it&#x27;s the <i>long</i>-term dietary (or supplementation) choices we make that are most the important, hence why I am increasingly more inclined to approach studies examining short-term effects (or lack of) with caution.",1427920381

No one wants to live deep in the forest if the road into it has not yet been cleared.<p>How then do you calculate a land tax fairly?  Surface area alone?

The lowest I can see is p = 0.07 (cardiac death prevention, as reported in their Table 3).<p>The multiple-hypothesis correction they apply is reasonably appropriate in the case of simply looking at all results, which is what they do.<p>Furthermore, because the outcomes are disjoint (cardiac survival vs stroke vs sudden death vs all-cause mortality, etc) there is no simple way to combine the results.<p>To take a silly example, studying the effect of seatbelts on cancer and cardiac death might well show a bit of an effect on both (because people who wear seatbelts are generally healthier, say) but it would be illegitimate to combine those two studies because the endpoints are (so far as we know) unrelated to each other. Without some kind of causal account the issues become very deep and difficult to say anything very definitive about.<p>So I&#x27;d say their statistical treatment is fair and appropriate. If fish-oil is supposed to have such a large effect as to be worth taking the risk that it increases the risk of prostate cancer, its effect should be unequivocally measureable in population studies.

What many of us seem to have failed to absorb is that water supplies are compartmentalized in such a way that saving in one area does not necessarily improve the situation in another area.  One city can run out of water while another has plenty.  Many cities have dedicated water supplies that are in no way connected to nor shared with agriculture, so saving even 100% of agricultural water provides no benefit for the municipal supplies.",1427919952

There are many things that we can say about the whole set of primes. We do know that the next prime after N won&#x27;t be much bigger than N in some sense (see Bertrand&#x27;s postulate).

TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV only works if both ends support it and it is largely a case of adding a workaround to support/enforce insecure behaviour. Unless you control both ends, you cannot be sure TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV is available and if you do control both ends you can either force TLS 1.2 and/or avoid client-side downgrade.</i><p>And the final reply:
<i>Server-side TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV support has reluctantly been added to LibreSSL.</i><p>I guess in the end the reluctance is more about it being new and untested and not so much a bad security practice.<p>[1] <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00</a>",1427919597

If you knock down your single-family house and erect a multistory condo, the value of the improvement will swamp the value of the land, and you will be punished with much higher property tax.<p>Georgists (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism</a>) explored the probable effects of land taxes extensively, though I don&#x27;t agree with the premises of their reasoning.<p>For one, Henry George drew the supply curve for land as a vertical line, to reflect the idea that you can&#x27;t make more land.  But different areas of land have different suitability for any given purpose.  It is true that you can&#x27;t increase the surface area of the Earth, but you can still rank every hectare by how much effort it takes to reach it from the center of global trade.  The economic projection of the world map is basically one huge ocean in the middle, a ring of port cities around it, roads and rivers spreading outward from there, and deserts and wilderness way out at the edges.  Those peripheral lands are the ones that get used last, when land prices are highest, and that&#x27;s why the supply curve for land is not vertical.<p>Besides that, it is difficult to separate the value of the land itself from the improvements on it, or even the improvements near it.  Is it just for you to be taxed more when someone else builds a train station near your house?  I think the way to levy a land tax that is least susceptible to abuse or political manipulation is to calculate it based purely upon surface area.  A hectare in the furthest backwater of the jurisdiction is taxed at the same rate as one in the busiest urban center.",1427918895

9306416,comment,9297230,9299746,0,0,MCRed,,,"(This issue hits politics, and below I give an illumination of why conservatives and liberals should both be concerned. But please note I&#x27;m not taking any position other than that people should learn more about the Federal Reserve.)<p>One of the &quot;reforms&quot; that was enacted in response to the 2008 crisis was to give the Federal Reserve regulatory powers.  They now get to decide whether banks are &quot;viable&quot; or not and if they are not viable, can force them to merge with candidates of the federal reserves choosing.<p>This might sound reasonable to you, if you focus on the &quot;Federal&quot; part of the name and that makes you think of the Federal Reserve as an agency of the federal government (like the DEA or FCC)... but the reality is that the Federal Reserve is a commercial, for profit, bank owned by major banks.  (The ownership is kept secret but the owners of the &quot;too big to fail&quot; banks are highly correlated with ownership in the fed.)<p>Thus you have a bank which has way too much power to begin with -- it literally profits by issuing US government debt-- able to force mergers of smaller, potentially competitive banks, with its owners.<p>This means that the owners of Morgan Stanley can force banks that might be competitive with Morgan Stanley into Morgan Stanley on terms that are good for Morgan Stanley, via the hand-wave of having the &quot;Federal Reserve&quot; decide that the target bank is &quot;in danger&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not giving you conspiracy theory, this is the literal facts of how the Federal Reserve was set up and is run.   For an authoritative account of the history of the Federal Reserve read &quot;The Creature from Jekyll Island&quot;.<p>Liberals are often very concerned about the corruption of government institutions or misuse of government power by corporations-- this is a far more relevant and dangerous example than most others of this action.<p>Conservatives are often very concerned about the undermining of the sovereignty of the country and the federal government, and here we have a major group that has massive control over the federal government (it is the Federal Reserve that enables deficit spending).  Since conservatives oppose deficit spending, this institution is a key enabler of the massive government debt they are concerned about.<p>Everyone with a passing interest in finance and economics should really read this book.  The Creature from Jekyll Island is wonderfully written and not too dry.  (Lots of historical anecdotes and since they are from within the last 100 years they are pretty relatable.)",1427918438

All the major apps have teams dedicated to each platform.

Windows 8 has picked up display drivers, wifi drivers and pretty much everything else that I care about in every laptop and desktop pc I&#x27;ve tried. I haven&#x27;t tried Linux recently (about two years ago) but when I did I had major headaches with a Broadcom wireless driver, and a Bluetooth chip, that both worked flawlessly on windows 8.<p>Installing &quot;common&quot; software is a doddle too, wth Ninite. You get Firefox, vlc, Dropbox, spotify, Skype (now in windows updates though) notepad++, up to date Java and .net run times, pdf reader etc etc. I set up the installer once about 3 years ago and the same one still works, with a one click update.",1427918421

It’s a hard problem to solve and we’ve shrunk the process down from months to minutes.<p>If you want to work someplace that’s just starting to take off but small enough to have a huge impact on its outcome, then we’re at the perfect Goldilocks size for you. The timing is great too: activity on our network is starting to spike and we’re getting great customer feedback on where to take it next.<p>Our development process is best described as “relaxed yet driven”. We have just enough process to keep momentum - big quarterly goals, weekly kickoff and wrapup meetings, team dinners on Wednesday nights, everything’s tracked in Trello - but it’s loose enough to give people the space to get shit done. So it’s more of a trust-based system than some childish flavor of agile. I.e. we don’t do daily standups, enforce pair programming, or have hourly work estimates. Yuck.<p>We’re looking for a senior dev, someone at least backend but ideally fullstack and as comfortable with server admin as they are with writing code. We’re a python/django/angular shop but honestly we care less about your specific skills than finding someone great, because you’d be more than good enough to pick up new languages anyway.<p>Interested? Great, then email me directly: al@partnered.com",1427918409

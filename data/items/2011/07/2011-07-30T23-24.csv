In 1988, it was the most progressive thing out there and some would say it still is. Apple leveraged their existing technology and ecosystem through OSX and all the way to iOS.<p>But the rest of the industry went in other directions. Objective-C/Cocoa would have been a strange choice for Android and would only have made it even more vulnerable to Apple's formidable patent arsenal. Instead, Android uses Java, which is also an attempt to leverage an existing ecosystem. But Android's fairly novel models of user interaction and application lifecycle required a whole new API. And Google had to reimplement the VM to avoid license fees, which still wasn't enough to avoid a patent attack.<p>In summary, as long as we have a) innovation and b) lawyers, we will constantly have to learn new development platforms which may not always be entirely novel.",1312070353

2827095,comment,2825269,2826980,2,0,glenra,,,"Thanks, that helps.<p>So when you said ""There is literally nothing to the entire worldwide ""global warming skeptic"" movement that is not completely based on and funded by these well-funded and completely unscientific propaganda campaigns."", are you claiming that <i>everybody who is a skeptic</i> is getting their info from Amy Moritz Ridenour or some similar person?<p>My guess is that you're defining ""the global warming skeptic movement"" in a limited and essentially circular way. You're defining anybody who comes by their AGW skepticism independently or as a result of <i>reading scientific papers</i> or thinking things through from first principles or following the blog debates...as not part of the ""movement"".<p>As one contrary data point, I consider myself a skeptic, have followed the AGW issue for at least a decade, and I'd never heard of Amy Moritz Ridenour or - so far as I know - been influenced by her. People I <i>have</i> been influenced by include Steve McIntyre, Craig Loehle, all the IPCC reports, Richard Feynman, Michael Crichton, and the whole gang at RealClimate (both positively and negatively). I do tend to assume <i>politicians</i> are going to (a) tend to be morons, (b) tend to get their talking points from PR firms and think tanks. So if you just look at what <i>Republican lawmakers say</i> you might have a point. But AGW skepticism as a whole is something that has been independently invented by a great many people, including scientists who publish papers and get in debates and even get involved with the IPCC. Including people who aren't republicans.<p>One can surely explain <i>some</i> AGW skepticism as the result of astroturf organizations that fear carbon taxes, just as one can explain on the other side <i>some</i> AGW boosterism as the result of groups that expect to profit from Carbon Trading markets. But to explain <i>all</i> of it that way misses the mark. People believe what they believe based on what they know and have seen. AGW boosters and AGW skeptics tend to have <i>different priors</i>. They had different values going in, which flavored how they perceived the case being made by the two sides.<p>Some AGW skepticism is organic and perfectly reasonable, given the information available to the people involved at the time. There are lots of conflicting theories one could point at to explain the same data; some of these theories have been published in peer-reviewed literature and haven't been well-addressed.<p>I don't care to defend Ridenour, because I don't know her and even if she were squeaky-clean, I'm sure you can find <i>somebody</i> who is what you say she is. But being able to find one example of somebody in a movement who makes mistake X is different from saying that <i>everybody</i> in that movement makes mistake X. I think the burden of proof is still on you to support that your claims weren't ridiculously overbroad.<p>UPDATE: Some people become skeptics when they see alarmists engaging in shenanigans that go beyond the science or deliberately downplaying uncertainty in the science, and always doing so in the same direction. For one such instance, consider Chris Landsea's resignation letter. Was it, in your view, unjustified? Is it unreasonable for someone who has read Landsea's letter to thereafter take IPCC conclusions with a grain of salt?

2827087,comment,2825638,2826635,1,0,Cushman,,,"I think you might be running into native speakers' bias. (I'll grant you I know nothing about Greek, just going off Wikipedia here, so forgive me.)<p>Greek is classified as a fusional language, essentially meaning that it's an agglutinating language with a more complex inflectional scheme that's harder for linguists to figure out. Naturally there's going to be less lexical ambiguity than in an isolating analytic language like English, since grammatical information we're used to inferring from context or marking lexically you're encoding as an affix. By contrast, we find your system of affixes complex and difficult.<p>The important thing to understand here is that a native English speaker treats words the way a native Greek speaker treats affixes. When we read a sentence, we automatically filter the words on the basis of the context, just the same way when you read a Greek sentence, you're automatically filtering affixes on the basis of context. The ""ambiguities"" you perceive ""right"" can be an adjective, noun, or verb  are effectively the same as, say, an ambiguous <i>-o</i> suffix which marks a tense on verbs, but a case on nouns. For native speakers, they simply never notice.<p>(Of course speakers of all stripes make mistakes and need to clarify ambiguities no matter how they're encoding information.)<p>And it goes the other way too. Take a native Californian language like Eastern Pomo, in which verb stems describe relationships of energy and motion which are difficult to describe in English. Copying from notes here: <i>For example, the stem pa-q-t(-ki-) has the root meaning ""to apply pressure"", the instrumental prefix implying from kinetic energy, and an intensifier, semelfactive and stative suffix. This stem means both ""to pry abalones loose from rocks with an iron bar"" and ""for high flood water to come down a creek and wash something away.""</i> Remember, this is a polysynthetic languagenearly every word has this sort of variance in meaning. We perceive that as horrifically ambiguous, and nigh impossible to parse without concerted effort, but a native Pomoan would never mistake them.<p>So, you know...

Basically, it is a sound toy.<p>The idea was to have three unique organisms that interact together to produce different sounds and visuals. One, for example, is a hanging plant which pans the audio when the phone is tilted from side to side. Another is a flock of flying insects that pollinates the hanging plants to produce stalks that vibrate like marimba keys on contact.<p>All the visual forms (besides the icons) and sounds are generative. Made with Android Processing and Pure Data.<p>Sonaur is $1.99 on the Android market.

I think that this attitude defies logic. Where do the employees come from if everyone is their own boss? Does this mean that when you hire employees you automatically assume that, ""well they must not be looking to start their own business,"" and therefore think the worst of them?",1312067563

Apple does not license the OS for clones.<p>4.  Google not only licenses the OS, it's completely free, as is their development kit and app store.<p>5.  Apple lacks some infrastructure redundancy and is reliant on ATT and Foxcon, maybe others.<p>Some differences this time around:<p>1.  Meta standards.  There's no longer the Microsoft file formats vs the Apple file formats that locked so much of the world into Windows/Office.  These open meta standards eliminate the possibility of lockin.  Hence even if Android pulls ahead in market share, it won't have the lockin that Windows had.<p>2.  Apple has fully transitioned from a computer company to an industrial design company.  They just happen to specialize in consumer technology (and are not too shabby with the business tech either, thanks to BSD).  Most people, consciously or subconsciously, perceive Apple this way as well.  Apple owns this niche.<p>3.  Unlike Microsoft, Google actually has a sense of design and aesthetics.  Not quite at Apple's artistic level, but, crucially, intuitive, easy to use for noobs, with power-user features under the hood.<p>I do see Android eventually outselling iPhone simply because  of its cost, openess (to handset makers, app devs, and end users), economy of scale, and Google brand.<p>But I think there's room in this field for both, and no lockin to prevent that.  Apple will do fine as the BMW of handsets, I don't see them coming so close to death in that role as they did the last time.",1275712137

IMHO it's easier to set up than sshfs too.",1275710772
1406319,comment,1405709,1405709,0,0,ellyagg,,,"It's an Apple page promoting Apple's adoption of emerging standards. I've never before seen criticism of a browser vendor adopting standards <i>too fast</i>. In general, web developers normally wish browser vendors had magical resources to implement proposals the next day and be able to iterate them just as fast as the proposals iterate.<p>Apple <i>is</i> at the forefront of standards adoptions, Safari's got some stuff that other browsers don't, and they want to show it off! What on earth is wrong with this? Firefox has better standards support? So what? Are we claiming Apple has a moral imperative to create demos of Firefox-only standards support?! Or, is it the even crazier claim that only the ""best"" product is allowed to promote itself? If you're selling Porsches and you say they're fast, is this offensive because Ferraris are faster? Good God.<p>I've also never before seen anyone so self-righteous about the use of the term html5; there's nothing about Apple's page which deserves special enmity for its ""misuse"" of this ambiguous term. In fact, I'm pretty sure in the future we'll see plenty of articles talking about html5, just as we have in the past, e.g., scribd converting from flash.<p>If you can't see how a company might find value in illustrating how quickly it implements emerging standards, I suggest you aren't thinking about it very hard. This page isn't about why web standards are important for cross-platform compatibility. Criticizing it for not demonstrating something which is not is purpose is awfully silly.<p>The outrage stirred up by the last couple of posts on this subject strikes me as follow-on to other perceived ""evils"" by Apple, and seems to be heavily biased rather than treating this issue on its own ethically distinct terms. But then, that's what people do.",1275710769

This leaves the non-technically inclined out in the cold, and informs those who may not know of the exploit of its existence.<p>Just something as simple as removing authplay.dll for Acrobat and Reader, and even upgrading the current version of Flash Player to the 10.1 beta, just temporarily… anything other than just announcing it and not patching it at <i>all</i>.<p>I don't know if this is a standard way of dealing with zero day exploits, but it sure doesn't seem like a good way.",1275710558

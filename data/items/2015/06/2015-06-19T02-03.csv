We focused on personal compatibility more than technical skills. Our team view was that technical skills can be taught/learnt but social and emotional maturity is hard to teach and learn. This philosophy wasn&#x27;t unique to the company just to our team.<p>We typically will have 4-5 hour day setup for series of interviews, preferably before lunch and during lunch. By this time remote team workers already have interviewed the candidate on phone and shared their impression to boss. First interview and last interview was by the Boss, in between we alternated between junior and senior members of the team as well as a few people from teams that we closely worked with in our job. Each interview lasted 30-45 minutes. Everyone was free to structure and cover whatever they wanted to explore during the interview. There were no prescribed method or feedback forms.<p>We provided verbal feedback to the boss as we walked by his cubicle after the interview. The typical feedback was &quot;S/he reminds me of XYZ or s/he is strange or something along these lines, sometime politically incorrect.&quot; The XYZ typically being a current or ex-team worker or someone we all have/had known. Sometime we will have little bit more to say but not much. The feedback typically ended with &quot;thumbs up,&quot; &quot;thumbs down,&quot; or &quot;thumbs sideways&quot;.<p>Even though, we schedule one person to take the candidate out for lunch, by the time lunch comes around, boss has pretty good guess whether candidate is hirable or not. If he is getting consistent thumbs up, we decide to take him out for lunch with the whole team. During the lunch, there is no discussion about interview or questioning candidate, just having a good time and treating the candidate as one of the team member. Of course everyone enjoys as we go for lunch to a nicer place and it is on company dime.<p>We continue the scheduled interviews after the lunch. Once interviews are over, we huddle for a quick 15 minute meeting with remote team members on the conference call and comment on the candidate. By that evening or early next morning boss lets everyone know the hiring decision he made.",1434682334

&quot;The species most commonly called nightshade in North America and Britain is Solanum dulcamara, also called bittersweet or woody nightshade. Its foliage and egg-shaped red berries are poisonous, the active principle being solanine, which can cause convulsions and death if taken in large doses. The black nightshade (S. nigrum) is also generally considered poisonous, but its fully ripened fruit and foliage are cooked and eaten in some areas.&quot;<p>This family also contains a fair amount of psychoactive members most of which are also poisonous at the right dose.

USB uses synchronous (request-response) wire protocol and one side is <i>always</i> requesting, another responding - hence master and slave. This is not runtime configurable/negotiatable.<p>Traditionally USB transceivers were designed as either master or slave (host/peripheral), though with the rise of smart peripherals (embedded/mobile devices) came need for both in one device. Manufacturers could design product with 2 different USB transceivers or use one that is configurable to either master or slave.<p>If you examine any mini/micro USB port/plug you will find 5 pins, and 4 pins on a large (both A and B). That extra pin is actually a toggle for OTG transceiver mode. Of course manufacturers can decide to internally wire transceiver to any mode and expose only data/power pins, but that does not stop transceiver from being OTG. Exactly this is done in top Android tables from mentioned site - they have nVidia Tegra SoC which actually uses OTG transceivers.<p>I am not intimate with PC hardware (would expect master-only transceivers), but, as I have said before, all embedded SoCs I have laid my hands on (not too many) used either slave-only or OTG transceivers.",1434681247

Back when I was a teenager I remember playing around with one of the Kai&#x27;s Power Tools to generate fractal-like images (I forget exactly which one it was, but it had a bunch of presets that would generate cell-like textures).<p>Thing was, I found them MASSIVELY anxiety-provoking and have never been able to figure out why.  They&#x27;d literally make me panicky.<p>These images are doing the same.  Even now, just thinking about them, my stomach is fluttering.  It&#x27;s something about the way they&#x27;re organic, but I don&#x27;t know what it is.  It&#x27;s definitely nothing rational.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of trypophobia; this does seem like it.  I wonder if it&#x27;s closely related to the feeling of disgust; somehow an evolved response to keep us away from rotten food perhaps? Things like bacteria growing on bread, or beehives.  Or any food that&#x27;s started decomposing.<p>There&#x27;s a cool documentary I remember seeing called &quot;How Art Made The World&quot;.  One of the things it talks about is how we&#x27;re driven to make more-than-perfect representations of things in our art.  Say we find something in the real world aesthetically pleasing.  With art, we can take that aesthetically pleasing stimulus and exaggerate it, resulting in the art being more pleasing than anything in the real world.<p>I wonder if that&#x27;s what happens here, with the almost-organic images somehow being &#x27;hyper-disgusting&#x27; as they coincidentally line up with a hyper-exaggerated version of a stimulus that on the scale of disgusting might be &#x27;slightly unappealing&#x27; in the form that we&#x27;d encounter it in the real world.",1434679307

Feynman&#x27;s &#x27;algorithm&#x27; isn&#x27;t nothing, it&#x27;s actually very rudimentary and important.<p>The act of writing the problem down requires you to have a language for discussing it. You also have to be able to specify what you are looking for in a solution. (That is, how do you know if you&#x27;ve solved the problem?) Then you work to produce a set of transformations from one to the other. That is the best way to purposefully solve any problem.<p>Just read between the lines a bit...",1418435966

I don&#x27;t know. Lots of jobs put that down, but usually they don&#x27;t really mean it.  It&#x27;s just another part of the unicorn job description.  The same people who want 10 years of experience in a 5 year old technology are the ones who put down CS degree requirements for every software development job.<p>But, actually, my beef isn&#x27;t with the requirements.  I know there ARE jobs where I&#x27;d be out of my depth because I haven&#x27;t had the formal training and that education has value.  I take issue with the fact that they let me get through the whole process before applying the degree filter.  If you&#x27;re going to filter on easily measured boolean signals like the presence or absence of a CS degree, you should do it at the beginning of the process and save everyone a lot of time.",1418435956

8743774,comment,8741599,8743680,0,0,ende,,,"This isn&#x27;t really true.  There are considerable indications that all that corporate money doesn&#x27;t really provide marginal advantages in close elections.  There&#x27;s an interesting study I read (would link but im typing from phone) that corporate donors don&#x27;t actually back candidates with an exectation of their election, but rather hedge their bets backing both candidates in a race in order to insure lobbying access with whoever wins.  So you&#x27;re actually right with your first statement, the problem is corruption, but at the post-election level.  These situations, and the nature of our elections in general, are largely the result of a two party system being fairly easy to game in that manner.  That in turn is largely the result of an electoral system that is mathematically predisosed towards two party outcomes.  The causes there are plurality voting, partisan primaries, and gerrymandering.  Funding is also an issue, but largely irrelevant by the bipartisan filtering process.<p>But solving that wouldn&#x27;t directly address the subject of the article. A true multiparty system however could possibly create enough policy market competiton to promote more innovation in policy ideas.<p>In any event, the OP of your reply is right.  The current trends are largely dictated by massive disruptions caused by labor market expansion, automation and hyperefficieny.  These developments bring both blessings and challanges, and in order to address the later we have to move beyond the tired prescriptions of the old world left and right ideaologies.  Just like with every prior technological disruption of the status quo, deleveraging and adaptation will eventually occur, but in the mean time we need a political system that facilitates idealogical innovation to smooth the bumpy road ahead.",1418435388

If you’ve only ever seen “name.name()”, you may be surprised that “(expression).name()” is possible.

In particular, bringing on web developers as active participants and the follow-on effects of having them join GitHub and modern practices (slowly), helped increase their profile and stature. In both cases, I hardly did most of the work, but I did spend a lot of time articulating a vision for these organizations as ones that could be far more effective by involving more practitioners. I think it has worked.<p>In the cases of Ember and Handlebars, I saw something missing in the ecosystem and built my own tools. In both cases, the tools were hardly instant-winners, and I had to spend a ton of time recruiting fellow-minded collaborators who shared a vision for the future.

When you don&#x27;t have somebody referring you inside the company, you&#x27;re doing well to even get acknowledged by 50% of the companies you cold-apply to.  Most companies will never write back, and many others will simply send a canned rejection if they can&#x27;t tell you are a 100% match for the role based on a glance at your resume.  Many companies simply don&#x27;t look very closely at applicants applying directly, and if you don&#x27;t have any of the signals people use as a proxy for quality (prestigious degree or prestigious job) it&#x27;s tough to make it out of the slush pile.<p>You have to approach your job search as if it were a sales funnel, focusing on optimizing those things within your control.

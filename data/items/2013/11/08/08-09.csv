So, Heinlein claims that it works without war.  But, you know, maybe he&#x27;s full of shit.  (that&#x27;s devil&#x27;s advocacy; I&#x27;m generally a big fan of RAH.)<p>But on top of that, why would it depend on war?  You&#x27;re born without a franchise, like in modern democracy.  But in modern democracy, you get your franchise simply by waiting 19 years (or some other number).  In the book, you get your franchise by agreeing to do Federal Service.  You apply, you choose a preferred form of service, you do aptitude testing, and you give up control over your own life for N years.  When each term is up, you can either re-enlist, or retire.  When you retire, you gain full citizenship!  There&#x27;s no requirement that Federal Service be military (Heinlein has claimed in other writing that he intended for &quot;95%&quot; of service to be non-military, but others have noted that this is less-than-clear in the book-as-written).  But even if it was all military... Switzerland has a military, with mandatory civil service, but no war.",1383900727

6695221,comment,6694749,6694749,17,0,pyalot2,,,"Not mentioned in that story, but relevant.<p>Modern cruise ships for the most part are equipped with medical facilities and staff of high standard, certainly higher than most destinations they set out for. It&#x27;s mainly because that&#x27;s regulation.<p>If a passanger falls seriously ill however, those facilities are merely the temporary means to keep you alive until the cruise ship arrives at the nearest port where it leaves you in the capable hands of local healthcare.<p>As it turns out, most of the time it means they kick you out of the ship to die. Because local healthcare of the garden variety is for the most part not capable of keeping a patient alive, unlike the shipborne medical facilities.<p>If you have the particular misfortune to be befallen of some sickness that looks anything like it could infect fellow passengers, no matter if serious or not, you might also be entirely on your own. Because things like quarantine facilities are not regulation. Because decontaminating a room is expensive, you&#x27;ll likely spend the duration to the next port in a bare cell that&#x27;s easy to disinfect afterwards. Should you die in there, they&#x27;ll make it look like they cared for you, and if not, well they acted by the book.<p>The reason this macabre theatre happens is because of this. Should a passanger die on your ship, it&#x27;s a huge headache for the cruise operator involving inspections, tons of paperwork, possibly a being forced to stay in port, missing a schedule and so forth. But if you can shuffle a passenger off to die somewhere else, it&#x27;s no longer your problem.<p>There is just one thing worse for the cruise operator than having somebody die on his ship. It would be for multiple people to die, or many to fall sick, for which the hassle would be exponentially worse than a single dead passanger.",1383900645

6695214,comment,6693066,6695016,10,0,hamburglar,,,"This isn&#x27;t about the beer parties, or the linkedin profile, or the personal website.  It&#x27;s about a petty PM with no legitimate complaints who has the misguided notion that you should be working 70 hours, and he is casting about for stupid reasons to call you &quot;not committed.&quot;  If that PM had any actual authority, then the author was 100% right to leave.  Even if he didn&#x27;t, that may not have been an environment you want to work in anyway if that sort of manipulation flies, so leaving might have been good.  But I&#x27;ve been in situations like this where some clueless guy in a polo shirt and khakis thinks he&#x27;s going to jedi mind trick you into working harder, and sometimes the correct response is to just ignore him instead of deciding the whole environment is toxic.  It&#x27;s a matter of how much influence this guy really had over the team.<p>Nobody else in the office who isn&#x27;t trying to pull this lame bullshit gives a damn if you go to the beer parties or not.  Some people like them, some people don&#x27;t.  Some people just want a chance to unwind after work and shoot the breeze over a beer.  Some people want to fuck off at 5:00 sharp on friday and go home and drink beers by themselves or with their real friends.  Some people don&#x27;t drink.  Nobody cares.  Sure, there are brogrammers in the world who are going to diss you or think you&#x27;re lame for not doing it, but this is on the level of people who would diss you for wearing the wrong brand of shoes, so fuck &#x27;em.  Same with the linkedin and website stuff: nobody cares unless they&#x27;re trying to use it as a pathetically ineffective lever against you.  It would be like complaining that you haven&#x27;t posted any Facebook updates gushing about your new job. You&#x27;d just laugh in their faces or ignore them, because it&#x27;s just so ludicrously irrelevant.<p>Through reading the article, I waffled between sympathizing with the author and thinking he sounds like someone who doesn&#x27;t have the backbone to say &quot;come back to me when you have concerns based on something real.&quot;  The impression that I got was that the author <i>accepted</i> that these factors were the measure of his contribution in this particular team, and thus decided that this was not the team for him, whereas what was needed was to put his foot down and say &quot;no, you&#x27;re not measuring me that way.&quot;  Because unless the whole company really was toxic, I doubt many others would have gone along with such a weak bunch of evidence that he&#x27;s &quot;not committed.&quot;",1383900488

I mostly give advice like this because I&#x27;m keenly aware that when I was young and stupid I was often a doormat in e.g. dealing with companies, and despite years of socialization which had suggested to me that being a doormat was praiseworthy, things started to get better in a hurry after I abandoned my default presumption of doormathood.<p>In your future professional dealings, and those of the peanut gallery, you may find that people often just expect you to agree to their terms because it&#x27;s easy, and that this is sometimes not in your interest.  I&#x27;ve done my fair share of that, and had it blow up in my face once or twice, and almost blow up in my face a few other times.<p>Not to talk too much of the particulars, but I once signed a fairly straightforward contract which had straightforward terms which I thought I understood.  In my ignorance, I did not understand that one paragraph -- which I thought was &quot;the usual boilerplate&quot; -- obligated me to do something which would have been very against my interest.  That situation ended up getting resolved amicably, but older and wiser consultants (and my lawyer), when told what I signed, have all the blood drain out of their face.<p>In the instant case, you&#x27;ve just been dealt a bum hand by an employer, and based on their previous conduct I would not advance them bus fare, to say nothing of going out of my way to help.  That &quot;release&quot; might include, hypothetically, an indemnification, a term which sounds almost synonymous to programmers.  It isn&#x27;t.  Your competent legal representative would, if they read &quot;indemnification&quot;, say Oh Hell No.  There are probably even worse terms that could potentially be in there that I&#x27;m not even sufficiently creative to dream up.<p>Why affirmatively ask for that sort of risk by signing a contract which gives you no upside at all?  You don&#x27;t owe them any more than declining politely and asserting that paying your for services rendered is not optional.  Asserting yourself there probably isn&#x27;t nearly as costly in real life as you might be modeling it as.<p>Anyhow, stuff to keep in mind for next time, and for those in the peanut gallery who might eventually be given a similar ultimatum.<p>Also, comporting yourself like a Serious Businessman who does Serious Business (like contracts) only when doing Serious Business routine things like asking for a contract review from an actual honest-to-6-minute-billing-increments attorney sends a strong signal to would-be counterparties that they should not attempt to take liberties with you.",1383899697

And then they moved to Unity, which I didn&#x27;t really care for.\nI&#x27;ve been back on Slackware since 13, I think, and I will not let go of it. It&#x27;s just my OS of choice, even if there are other beautiful Linux distributions out there. :)<p>Patrick, my hat is off to you and your team, for keeping this beautiful operating system going.

Then why now, with all the world at stake, do so many people retreat into these entirely personal solutions?\nPart of the problem is that weve been victims of a campaign of systematic misdirection. Consumer culture and the capitalist mindset have taught us to substitute acts of personal consumption (or enlightenment) for organized political resistance. An Inconvenient Truth helped raise consciousness about global warming. But did you notice that all of the solutions presented had to do with personal consumptionchanging light bulbs, inflating tires, driving half as muchand had nothing to do with shifting power away from corporations, or stopping the growth economy that is destroying the planet? Even if every person in the United States did everything the movie suggested, U.S. carbon emissions would fall by only 22 percent. Scientific consensus is that emissions must be reduced by at least 75 percent worldwide.<p>Or lets talk water. We so often hear that the world is running out of water. People are dying from lack of water. Rivers are dewatered from lack of water. Because of this we need to take shorter showers. See the disconnect? Because I take showers, Im responsible for drawing down aquifers? Well, no. More than 90 percent of the water used by humans is used by agriculture and industry. The remaining 10 percent is split between municipalities and actual living breathing individual humans. Collectively, municipal golf courses use as much water as municipal human beings. People (both human people and fish people) arent dying because the world is running out of water. Theyre dying because the water is being stolen.<p>Personal change doesnt equal social change.\n Forget Shorter Showers: Why Personal Changes Does Not Equal Political Change<p>Even if every Guy Fawkes mask were made at Foxconn itself, a boycott wouldn&#x27;t do anything to the working conditions. Teens would still purchase them based on the movie (or, heaven forbid, the actual comic book).

That&#x27;s called aversion and has zero cause outside of your own mind. It means you got sick after eating pork a long time ago. Nothing more. Nothing bad about it, most people have at least one aversion. Explaining it through &quot;corpse smell&quot; is stupid though.<p>2) a lot of Indian households are indeed &quot;vegetarian&quot;, in the sense that they can&#x27;t afford any meat (not even poultry). They replace it by eating animal fat on bread. Pig fat mostly. Europeans do the same thing, and today you can get it as a delicacy. It&#x27;s a very original taste, but let me tell you. If you dislike the smell of bacon, this is unlikely to agree with you.<p>3) &quot;There are many cultures around the world who abstain from meat for religious reasons, eg Buddhists and Hindus&quot;. Hindus abstain from eating cow meat (though not milk). I&#x27;m not aware of Buddhist attitudes, but the first line on wikipedia directly contradicts what you&#x27;re saying [1]. Clearly it&#x27;s only monks (which have been eating meat for -at least- 14 years as part of the general population). There are zero cultures around the world that abstain from meat alltogether. For obvious reasons : if you do, people die, without fishoil and pig fat (&quot;food supplements&quot;, guess what they&#x27;re made of ?).<p>4) how do you talk yourself out of the -many- cases of food deficiency caused by vegetarianism and/or veganism ? Not just the ones today, but the many documented attempts, for seafaring and other travels of vegetarian diets that resulted in death on a large scale. Large enough to alter outcomes of battles, kill entire crews and so on.<p>5) Also the tons of instances of babies dying from food deficiency where it was blamed -by medical professionals- directly on the diet of their parents ? I hope you&#x27;re not planning on having kids - ever (although a kid will be fine with a vegetarian father, it&#x27;s the mother that causes problems early on. Afterwards, not feeding the kid meat or fish is bad). Hell I checked in the supermarket here and the apple + banana baby feed mentions that infants can&#x27;t survive on fruit alone, and you really should also provide meat and fish products, ideally both.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_vegetarianism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_vegetarianism</a>",1383898042

Thus, when he goes public saying there is a critical - not to mention quite sensational - security issue, it has an immediate effect outside of himself. An alarm goes off; in business, in the security industry, and predictably in the media. &quot;What do we know of this new virus Dragos has identified&quot;?<p>&quot;Urr...nothing, really&quot;. &quot;Come on, you gotta know something. Is our hardware vulnerable?&quot;. &quot;Urrr...dunno. We don&#x27;t know if it exists, even&quot;. &quot;But but, Ars Technica, ErrataRob and Schneier have written about it?&quot; &quot;Sigh, yes, I know.&quot;<p>This is why I&#x27;ve been vocal about getting these data confirmed. It&#x27;s not about bashing Ruiu, it&#x27;s not about being negative, it&#x27;s not about whether I myself am able to verify everything - it&#x27;s about trying - and failing - to get people to not lose their heads before the data are in.<p>So please don&#x27;t frame this as &quot;naysayer&quot; discussion. If you shout fire in a crowded theater, you better have something to back it up with.",1383897680

While NSA may have political motives and thus may use illegally obtained information for political ends, Facebook et al. could use it for reasons that serve their economic gain. That&#x27;s a conclusion that&#x27;s just as undesirable (if not moreso) than NSA using it.<p>I don&#x27;t see a very good future of fighting the &#x27;surveillance internet&#x27; if we don&#x27;t face the notion that once data is out there -- of lots of people, in one place -- NSA will always be interested in it and will probably get it. Pragmatically speaking, pulling out of Facebook, Google, etc. is the only surefire way to fight the surveillance internet.",1383897669

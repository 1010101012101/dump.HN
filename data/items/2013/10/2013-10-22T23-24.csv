It is slower, and slightly different port layout (which is annoying, as otherwise it is perfect dimensions to fit all cases etc.). Apart from that the only problem is that the GPS antenna is way too short, so if GPS matters to you  you pretty much need to open the phone and mod it. Other than that it&#x27;s an excellent phone.<p>The B92m is last years model, and I bought it for about $240 at the time. This year you can get quad core full hd (1920x1080) phones for the same price.<p>Basically it is down to reading reviews in advance to ensure the features you care about works as they should.<p>Safety is really not a concern when it comes to the phone itself - if you&#x27;re worried, throw away the charger and pick up any USB charger you trust more.<p>Overall keep in mind that most of these &quot;copies&quot; are only copies or imitations of better known brands on the surface - if you open them up what you tend to see is boards that are closely following the same reference boards for either MTK (Taiwanese fab-less manufacturer; one of the worlds largest semiconductor companies), Rockchip or AllWinner (Cinese mainland) CPUs.<p>You can pick up devices from dozens of different manufacturers and find boards that are close to (or totally) identical in most of the ones using the same SOCs. In the case of AllWinner at least, chances are the devices are designed by close partners of AllWinner - I&#x27;m assuming the same is the case for MTK and Rockchip.<p>The upside of this is that it&#x27;s not like some random little outfit have actually designed most of the internals of most of these phones - they&#x27;re largely well tested designs from well established large engineering companies. Most of them are also very simple, relying on MTK, AllWinner or Rockchip SOCs that embed most of the functionality in a single package, so the boards often just break out ports and have minor supporting circuitry which is presumably a big reason why they&#x27;re so popular with this market segment.",1382485489

Maybe, maybe not. But we should probably consider that independently of whether or not their theories turned out to be right. After all, we can never be 100% sure of our knowledge; the best we can do is seek the most reliable methods of inquiry. If a conspiracy theorist makes 50 predictions and 45 of them turn out to be correct, then we might have a reason to adopt their thought patterns; if someone has one big suspicion and that suspicion turns out to be true, I&#x27;m not sure how much we can conclude from that.<p>(Sorry, I know this discussion is getting off-topic...

I think it has batteries in it and sends tip pressure information to the iPad over Bluetooth.<p>(How the inductive sensing works: You have some conductive loops behind the display, and in the pen there is a ferrite rod with a conductive coil around it together with a capacitor to make a resonant circuit. You pass an alternating current at approximately the resonant frequency through some of the loops; it couples to the pen circuit by electromagnetic induction, the pen circuit resonates, and for a short time it produces, by induction again, a signal in all the other conducting coils behind the display. How much signal depends on the position and angle of the coil in the pen. If you have enough loops behind the display you can work out where the pen tip is accurately enough to draw with it. The capacitor in the resonant circuit is variable and adjusted by the tip pressure, and small changes in the resonant frequency produce phase changes in the signal that comes back, so you can measure the tip pressure too. Similar technology is used in some interactive whiteboards.)",1382484877

So I specced out the Macbook Pro that I wanted, specced out (roughly) equivalent systems with every major brand at the time (circa 2006, this was the Core 2 Duo CPU version). I got a lot of systems that were close enough (+/- 50GB depending on their HDD sizes, = RAM or slightly more because I had some minimum I wanted at the time, close enough clock speeds with the same CPU (+/- .2GHz)). Every one of them ran to +/-$300 of the cost of the Macbook Pro, and not all of them had educational discounts (still in school at the time so I could take advantage of that). I haven&#x27;t done this comparison in years, but ~2009 I did it again because I was tired of the noise from my coworkers and it came out similarly, similar specs meant priced within 200-300 of the Mac.

First it was updating the website for my friend&#x27;s art gallery getting paid $20 an hour in trade out when I was in college. Next it was helping out a friend who was doing a larger contracting project, then I did a project for someone who I randomly met at a friend&#x27;s party. Before I knew it, I&#x27;d been doing little contracting projects on the side for 10 years.<p>That&#x27;s when I decided to make the jump into full time. I didn&#x27;t have the client base to do that, but I had the experience and confidence that I could present a professional front. I had business cards and invoice systems, time trackers, etc. I then did a similar thing to what rfnslyr described doing when starving: Find a product that companies need and you can build with your skills. Then it&#x27;s just a matter of knocking on doors. Last year I cold called a company with a proposal on how I could augment their business. A month later they signed a $40,000 contract with me to implement stage one. Since then, they followed on with two additional contracts and now I have an open ended contract with them to work &quot;As many hours as I have time for.&quot; The important question is to ask yourself what you can offer that will add value to a company. There are opportunities all around you for that. You just have to think a little bit outside the box.

Perhaps it was some non-technical person who heard one of the junior developers lamenting about what <i>seemed</i> like a project with 500M lines of code? It would be really hard to believe that a website consisting of a registration form and a few API calls to get pricing data would ever get to that many lines of code. Also, keep in mind that the site was reported to have cost $600 million, but actually only ran $90 million. Given the political climate surround the legislation, it seems we must take any reporting on it with a whole bag of salt.",1382483025

The kitchen is the back end, with all the databases and services. The contractor most responsible for the back end is CGI Federal.</i>&quot;<p>Uh, no.  Unless everything we&#x27;ve heard is completely wrong about them being responsible for the front end, and e.g. Quality Software Services Inc. (QSSI), a unit of United Health Group, being responsible for the backend identity module (using a known to work, even if it&#x27;s a pain, package from Oracle).<p>This article is mostly a plea to do things the open source and specifically GitHub way.  Except for mentioning the typical total opaqueness of what&#x27;s behind the front end to those of us not connected to the problem, it doesn&#x27;t address the major well known issues that made <i>certain</i> this would be a failure.  I keep saying this, but here goes again:<p>HHS&#x27;s CMS, i.e. government bureaucrats and perhaps political appointees, who had no serious (or any???) experience, assumed the role of integrator, including integration testing.<p>They and those above were late with specifications and requirements, kept changing them (7 major ones in the last 10 months per the NYT), were making changes in the week before launch, per the AP did integration testing and when they did a simulation test of 200 simultaneous logins just before launch the modules they were testing locked up.  As did the site shortly after its midnight launch.  Oh, yeah, three days after the launch CMS panicked and proposed to fire QSSI and punt their identity system, but eventually decided that would take longer than QSSI getting it to work; who knows, but that&#x27;s another sign of CMS as the integrator failing hard while distracting both QSSI and CGI Federal.<p>Contrary to what the author says near the end:<p>&quot;<i>Doubtless the problems will get fixed. All bugs are shallow with the president watching.</i>&quot;<p>No, there&#x27;s no guarantees enough of the problems will get fixed with the current setup and processes (or lack thereof) in the time politics will allow before the nation times out on this mess (Jan 1 is a very hard deadline for all those losing their soon to be illegal major medical plans, and as of now these exchanges are the only way to get mitigating subsidizes for the gold-plated minimum plan).<p>So far, &quot;the president watching&quot; has been reported to result in the White House and CMS ... working on a plan forward, which will hopefully be finished Thursday, 3 and a half weeks after the launch.  I.e. we&#x27;re not seeing decisive action, not even an admission there&#x27;s a really serious problem.",1382482893

I'd say an average of twice a week for the past few months.<p>With respect to your comment about the green tea, you will certainly acquire a tolerance to the caffeine after consuming it for an extended period of time.

Pretty much the same ideas as mentioned in the article: complimentary skills are good; time flexibility is good; too much tech talk needs to be balanced with non-work adventures.<p>It was hard at first: the boundary between work and personal disagreements is harsh, especially because your spouse is otherwise your best supporter and level-minded advisor. The joyful adventures of being together were replaced by work and stress.<p>These problems aren't caused by there being something inherently troublesome about spouses working together. That situation just provides some increase in stress and decrease in decompress than more standard setups.<p>Thus, it's a really useful scenario to explore! In our case, it helped us develop better communication skills, both professionally and personally. I am so glad we took this opportunity and ran with it.",1235026041

Exercise. It does help. Not only does it keep you feeling fit, but the chemicals released in the process have been shown to improve cognitive performance. On an unrelated (but interesting) note, people who imagine working out for twenty minutes a day or more actually perform better in exercise tests than people who do not. Cool, eh?<p>2. Meditation. Again, it not only feels refreshing, but trains your brain to ignore distractions and perform more efficiently. I semi-regularly practice meditation and I find that afterwards I'm endowed with a keen sense of euphoria and concentration.<p>3. I drink green tea. I've managed to pick up some minimally-processed imported Japonica whole-leaf green tea and I must say, it is bliss in liquid form. The slight caffeine boost enhances cognitive performance, or at least it appears to.<p>4. Everything else: diversifying your habits, getting hobbies, coding, reading, organizing, starting new projects, communicating with people, writing, etc. all help to get the proverbial gears turning (churning?).<p>There are no shortcuts to a genius brain, however.

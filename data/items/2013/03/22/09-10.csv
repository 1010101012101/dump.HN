5422072,comment,5420670,5421817,3,0,cbennett,,,"this is correct. for those with a hazy understanding of quantum mechanics- or to lazy to read link- the adiabatic process basically adds an extraneous (kinetic) part to the Hamiltonian and then the commutation of these properties allows for a superior process than thermal annealing. D-Wave folks would like us to believe that this imitates the vast majority of computation improvements expected in QC, and it may yet create some performance improvements.<p>However, in 'true' QC, there is something very physically different happening; we expect to see universal superposition of Hamiltonian states (entangled vector bases), which allows for some remarkable parallelism in a gate architecture that mirrors programmable (classic) computers. Specifically, we would be able to perform an operation  on 2^N  different numbers with just one calculation, while in classical computing such a computation would actually require 2^N separate (sequential) iterations. DWave systems, although it has produced some evidence of engtanglement, could not achieve anything on this magnitude of computational efficiency/parallelism. Footnote: as promising as the big picture of recombining said superpositions and 'hacking the multiverse' (a la Deutsche) is, fragility & decoherence of said states is an extraordinary barrier to overcome in order to achieve a 'true' QC in the near term or even medium term (as some critics as Wolfram would argue)...",1363946230

So good for you. You seem to be alone (if you ignore all the cowards - like me - who just decided to be quiet).<p>I don't find the above comments to be very inflammatory, though. There's a not-totally-insane POV from which Adria's actions were not only reasonable, but commendable, and necessary to disrupt an inherently hostile environment. (I don't agree with this point-of-view, and think it addresses superficial problems with culture rather than attack fundamental problems with education, but whatever.) From that same point of view, these comments are entirely reasonable - the fact that Adria is being treated as she is is only another incarnation of appalling systematic misogyny. Adria, by posting those guys' photos to twitter, was standing up to that perceived culture (if you buy into this - I personally think she was just power-tripping), and attacking Adria for doing that sounds a lot like someone saying ""shut up, sit down, stop causing trouble"" to someone reporting a fire.<p>That rmrfrmrf's comments were taken as inflammatory (by you) seems to me to be less of an indicator of the vitriol in his rhetoric, and more a measure of the gap between the two sides of this debate. (A gap this fiasco has apparently done nothing to bridge, sadly.)<p>That rmrfrmrf's comments were taken as inflammatory by those who sent the death threats / dismembered baby pics, on the other hand, is a good measure of the number of complete idiots who frequent HN. Hopefully not too many.<p>Lastly, please do /not/ tell someone who has received (or claims to have received - just to be fair) death threats to take a metaphorical chill-pill, or otherwise imply that he/she ought to correct his/her own behavior to make the death threats stop.

Trans men especially tend to take a lot of shit from women who think they've committed some sort of cardinal sin for being who they are (it's usually phrased as them trying to make some sort of male power grab, or whatever). Women should have rights, but men should have them too. That's what equality ought to entail. Currently, we've made some significant progress not just in recognizing the need for women's rights, but actively forcing a change in the status quo. It's still politically incorrect to even recognize that men are discriminated against in some areas, and that's really disheartening to me.<p>True gender equality would HELP the GLBT cause because we need lesbians to not take crap for not being feminine ""enough"" and gay men to not take crap for not being ""masculine"" enough. Sex discrimination against men is actually a huge issue, but it's so politically incorrect to address it. If you're a man, and GLBT, you can kind of get double whammied by it since you have to deal with the GLBT part and then also the discrimination against men when you're already severely disadvantaged. If you're a woman, you have a lot of social support dedicated to you (domestic violence shelters, lots of other assistance), at least compared to men.<p>I believe that women and men BOTH should have rights. I don't understand why this is such a problem with the majority of the feminist movement. (I have met some absolutely lovely and rational feminists, but most of them are over the age of 50. I'm not really sure what's happened to this generation of them, but for the most part, it's been really...not good.)<p>I also really hope that same-sex marriage will help the men's rights movement (as well as the women's rights movement!). As an egalitarian, I'm all for the courts coming to realize that brain breaking moment in a lesbian divorce where they can't just give the kids and all the money to the female, because there are two of them. Perhaps a concrete inability to rotely perform sex discrimination because there aren't different sexes to take up their traditional ""roles"" will force the legal system to look into itself and realize the magnitude of the discrimination against men that they've been perpetuating.",1363944534

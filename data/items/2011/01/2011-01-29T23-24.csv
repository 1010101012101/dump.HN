You had to go sign up for pip.io, it was gonna be huge and it was so awesome to have all your social media content in one place.<p>So, yeah. I hear you. I'd rather not diss the guy, because he has added a lot of value just by covering the startup space and conducting a lot of great interviews. I just wish he would spend more time doing quality blogging.<p>I give a lot of credit to Scoble, though. He's unique among the meta-geek crowd in that he'll respond to anybody as long as you have something intelligent to say without regard for whether you're in the ""inner circle"" of SV. Not many people at his level do that; in fact the only other person I can put in that category is Steve Jobs.",1296345456

Money in excess of $90k isn't confiscated, it's still used to purchase status just as it is today. The only difference is that it's purchased from the government instead of BMW, De Beers, etc. Status markers are essentially arbitrary anyway, why not just have a single number? It's much more efficient.<p>> suppose that every employer that currently pays anyone $(90k+x)/year decides to pay them, say, $(90k+0.1x)/year<p>They could do that, and it would lower everyone's rank. This would cause some people to quit those jobs and find other jobs that offered more status, lowering supply and causing the price to go up again. If salaries drop because of market forces, the savings would be used to invest in the business: hiring other employees, improving operating efficiency, R&D, etc.<p>>  they also want to get rich because wealth brings large houses, etc.<p>Any income above $75k doesn't contribute to personal happiness, and standard income is already 20% above that. Luxury goods don't contribute to happiness, they're just a wasteful and inefficient way of signaling status. That money that could be used to improve lives or fund innovation.",1296345132

2156824,comment,2155710,2156435,0,0,Stormbringer,,,"If you want to do some research into the gun debate, a good place to start is the movie ""Bowling for Columbine"".  Some people will think of it as an extreme left-wing-nutjob propaganda piece, but my recollection of the movie is not that it hammers you with a conclusion, but that it presents a bunch of different scenarios that are all 'odd' in their own way.  Accusing BfC of being a propaganda piece is like calling Borat a propaganda piece, stylistically they are quite similar.<p>Anyway, one of the things that really struck me about that movie was the difference in gun related deaths (per head of population) in Canada and the U.S.  Basically both countries have buttloads of guns and the justification in both is that they are for 'hunting'.  I don't remember the exact figures, but the deaths per 1000 from guns was enormously much higher in the U.S. than in Canada.  Moore doesn't give an answer to that dilemma per se, but he does throw it out there for people to think about and make up their own minds.  Frankly, if that is propaganda, I think the U.S. and the internet in general need a lot more of it.<p>-----<p>As for the guns debate, you could make an analogy to poison, where you say that poisons are sold at the supermarket, so why not sell guns at the supermarket too?  I guess the reply would be that the poisons that are sold invariably have some other practical use, e.g. cleaning products.  Whereas guns are pretty much designed with the express and only purpose of killing stuff.<p>Then the gun-nut will reply ""oh, there's lots of other uses for a gun, like sport (target practice), hunting and personal defense as a deterrent"".  The problem isn't that those things are wrong, the problem is that - unlike pretty much every other country in the world with guns - people in the U.S. don't seem to stop at deterrent, they are much more likely to use the 'personal defense' guns to try to kill someone else.<p>Why is that?<p>What is it about the U.S. that as soon as they get a gun in their hand they want to go 'pop a cap in yo ass'?<p>And why doesn't that happen in Canada?<p>Some of the scenarios I remember from the movie that were presented:<p>The bank that gives you a shotgun when you open an account<p>The mall store(?) that was selling ammo in massive aisles<p>The five year old that took a handgun to school and shot one of his class-mates dead<p>The Columbine massacre<p>The gun lobby holding a big pro-guns rally in Columbine immediately after the massacre<p>Moore harassing Charlton Heston (figurehead of the gun lobby) (this one was most like a scene from Borat - it was an uncomfortable 'excuse me while I invade your personal' thing and went on for ages)",1296345064

2156819,comment,2155654,2156613,0,0,Pinckney,,,"By living and working in a country such is America, you are accepting a social contract: if you do well, you will be taxed, if you do poorly, you will at least receive some services to support you. This strikes me as an entirely reasonable contract, though there are others that are different. In Abu Dubai, you can do well, and keep all your money, or do poorly and wind up in debtor's prison.<p>To complain that you're taxed too heavily <i>after you have already become wealthy and secure</i> strikes me as akin to looking back on your healthy, illness free life and complain that you should get a refund on your insurance payments, since they didn't do anything for you.<p>The above is not to argue that one system is superior to the other, but rather that you're in one, and very probably complaining about it now that you know you're well prepared enough that it's clear that you'll probably never be destitute.<p>In a perfect world, we might ask everyone how much risk they want. Unfortunately, so much is determined in your youth. You (I assume) grew up in a family that raised you well, and left you with reasonable earning potential. If we just asked everyone at 18, we would wind up with an upper class that would rarely suffer financial failures, and would accept risk, and those who know they won't get rich on their own, and accept no risk, and so for the most part, this system would be unfundable. As a compromise, and as many of us feel quite strongly that it's simply not acceptable to have people destroyed when they suffer financial ruin, we have some basic social services.",1296344870

Christophe Rhodes has a proposal for an extensible sequence protocol, but AFAIK it is implemented only in SBCL.  There's no portable way in CL to extend the built-in hash tables.  And you certainly can't have your own cons class that responds to the built-in CAR and CDR.<p>Of course you can always shadow the builtin names and redefine them in your package as generic functions; this is what I did in my FSet functional collections library.

You should do a better job of selling yourself. Nothing in your post screams out ""this is I guy I need get get in touch with."" Tell us what you bring to the table besides ""a few neat ideas."" Do you have a track record of success raising money, or selling something for actual money? Or some previous successful startup in your background? Have you done any customer development, market research, etc? Is there any demonstrable reason to think that your ideas are worth pursuing?<p>>>First of all, I'll admit that I don't have the experience that nearly all of you do. Rather than exaggerating what little experience I have, I chose to simply present what I do have to offer; what benefits I think HN would be interested in. I have two ideas that my current co-founder deemed worthy enough to work full-time on; I won't spam them here but I'll happily email anyone who wants to hear more about them. All I bring to the table is ideas and money, and if you determine my current ideas to be of a good enough quality to try working on me with another, we can proceed.<p>2. There are actually some red flags here that scream ""warning."" You're already working with somebody on two partially completed projects, and you want to jump into something else? That and the phrasing like ""a few neat projects"" could kinda opens the door to the perception that you're just dabbling and not terribly serious. NOTE: I'm not saying that you aren't serious, just pointing out the possible perception.<p>>>I don't know much about the world. I don't know almost anything about programming. But I think I understand the nature of humans and the nature of the internet well enough to present ways in which they can be connected. If people who know enough about programming are able to understand my ideas (I'm not saying this will be difficult, I'm just explicating the logic), they will be able to allow people who use computers to use the app to achieve its objective.<p>And the question of seriousness aside, there is a practical consideration of how many projects one person can be actively involved in at the same time.<p>>>I will do what I can, but again I have no experience. Most of my ideas are for ""viral"" apps where no other form of marketing is considered in my thought process, but if need be I am willing to do what we agree is necessary.<p>3. Make it clear if you want an actual co-founder or ""just a programmer."" If everything is going to be ""your ideas, his programming"" then you aren't looking for a co-founder, you're looking for a programmer for hire. A co-founder will have his/her own ideas, and will challenge your ideas, tell you your idea sucks, or that part of it sucks, or that it's not possible, or that it's not practical; and will point out alternatives, suggest features, identify flaws and otherwise help develop the direction for the product(s).<p>>>I suppose my understanding of the definition of ""co-founder"" is a little vague. Regardless, I stated what the agreement of the partnership would entail, so this is what I want; any name assigned to it is fine.<p>4. Why not go ahead and share something about what you're working on? Give a tease or taste, to get people interested. I'm sure more than a few people are going to read this and think ""Eh, no clue what he's doing, it's probably boring, can't be arsed emailing him."" If you described your project in even general terms (""a website for buying petfood online!"") then anybody who was particularly interested in that space would have their ears perked up a little, at least.<p>>>I have the explanations for my current ideas typed out and will email them to anyone interested. I claim to have ideas of similar quality as my current projects, so if you like what I'm working on, you might be willing to work on others with me. If not, it's just a few minutes of bouncing off an idea or two.",1296344071

Therefore a lot of small angel investors can't invest anymore in YC startups (I guess YC will push out 100 startups/year - for sure a big chunk). Thus, they will go somewhere and the one who were able to invest, were able to invest at huge valuations whit less nice terms, so they will get smaller future returns (bad for the future of the ecosystem).<p>To conclude, my concerns are not about now but about the future cause there is a risk that we'll have less angels, then less money available for entrepreneurs.

Based on my casual observation of the new stories page over the last month this user submits a lot of stuff. There's not necessarily anything wrong with that. But submitting a lot of stories is a good way to get lots of karma quickly, since stories are voted up more highly and it takes almost no time to do.<p>I agree that the downvote karma threshold has been instrumental in maintaining the quality of discussion here on HN, but it seems like it's too easy to get around by submitting lots of stories. And that drastically reduces the socialization period.",1296342162

And, as it is, I accept their explanation for it (which appears to be; they were airing a sermon from a slightly more hard line cleric, and he made extreme comments. Turning that into not having moral problems accepting... etc. is something of a leap.<p>And I don't think you could prove/show this is systemic problem at the channel. (We occasionally have racist/nasty comments made on UK media, and lots of fuss about it, that doesn't make the channel racist!)<p>You should <i>always</i> generally distrust your media source as a matter of course.<p>I'm not going to argue this with you because it looks like you have an axe to grind, and this really isn't the place. But put AJ next to a lot of US media and I find them more neutral and informative :) Anti-Semitism is a huge problem in a wide portion of media (as I mentioned), it is one of the problems that means we have to take what they say with caution in some matters, but from <i>my observation</i> (and barring a few slips) AJ has a better track record than, says, FOX.<p>>  I should also note that you lack references for your claim?<p>In case it is not obvious... this is my opinion... sheesh. :)",1296342049

I had originally hoped to gain more independence and perhaps increase my income a bit, but not particularly aimed to reduce my working time. In practice, I worked a much lower number of hours for several months, due to some third party problems reducing the pace of the project below what my clients and I had wanted. Of course, this hit my income pretty hard on an hourly rate. However, it also gave me a lot of spare time to relax and offload the past few years of work stress, learn about new things, get back into some hobbies I'd been missing, spend more time with family and friends, and so on. Last year was probably the most enjoyable time I've had since I started full-time work, and many friends and family have commented on how much happier I seem these days.<p>I'm happy to be pushing he hours and income back up again now, so I can consider things like buying a nice house and supporting a family, because those things matter to me too. But we did just fine on a lower financial income but with more free time for a while, and I'd happily do it again from time to time rather than be the live-to-work guy for my whole life.",1266097767

In fact, having killed her brother in a firearms accident, I can easily see her spending the rest of her life as a desperate overachiever, and feeling unable to take credit for her success because she ""owed"" it to her brother. Imagine the depression and motivation that would induce. Finally, having hit such a dramatic obstacle, her previous experience with death would lower her visceral revulsion to the idea of further death.

1123610,comment,1123211,1123211,0,0,gridspy,,,"I believe that Gridspy is helping at least partially with 2.  Make solar energy economical.<p>It helps like this:\nGridspy can measure the power usage of a building, helping you to specify a system that will satisfy that particular building's energy footprint and timing. Choices such as size of the battery bank, size of the battery array and capacity of the inverter bank depend on how power is used.<p>The Array itself needs to generate enough power over the course of a week or so to power the building for that week. Knowing exactly how much power is used helps you to specify the correct size so you don't spend too much on panels.<p>The Batteries need to be large enough to handle any difference between the power used when the sun is poor and the solar array's yield at that time. Knowing exactly when during the day power is used helps to specify how many batteries to install.<p>Finally, the peak power usage of the building determines how large the bank of inverters should be. Inverters convert battery power to usable mains - if there are not enough inverters, you will need to fall back on other power sources (generators / the grid) when you need lots of power for HVAC or lighting.<p>Gridspy can help you choose the right amount to spend on each of these different subsystems since it monitors your power usage at high resolution. Once the system is installed, Gridspy can monitor the solar yeild, the battery levels and the current demand to show you how well your solar installation is performing. This helps to prove that the investment in solar power was financially sound.",1266097397

I don't give a crap about any of those things.<p>I don't care about them because the only thing I need it to do is to help me find a roommate, sell my stuff, or maybe find a date.<p>When I post a roommate opening to CL, I get responses immediately.

Some hint or pointer that would make it clear, and this hint would be available to all humans. Some people would not understand it, or ignore it, but everywhere in the world, a few people would choose to follow the correct religion.<p>There are many religions in the world, but only one is universal: non-belief. In some places they are few and far between, but everywhere you find a few people who don't believe in God. For all other religions there are places in the world where that religion is simply not present. But every place has a few people who don't believe. These people must have correctly understood God's hint.<p>Hence, if God exists, atheism is the true religion.",1266095080

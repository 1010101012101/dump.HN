The wrote to me this morning saying URGENT: All free Backify accounts will be closed on November 22, 2011
So I paid for an upgrade.
Then Livedrive wrote to me saying Backify are no longer a reseller and their users should get their payment transaction cancelled.
Livedrive said:
We would also like to advise you that we have received a number of complaints about BACKIFY.COM from their customers and from industry organizations<p>My question is - should users be more careful about trusting their confidential data to startups - when if fact they have no idea if these startups are legitimate organizations?",1321444613

3242722,comment,3238237,3239437,1,0,buster,,,"> That is a sample of one. Try visiting a YAPC and you'll see a sample of 1000+ that is opposite to your's.<p>Sure, i never said that no one likes Perl. I'm well aware that many people like Perl. This may sound harsh, but here is my impressions of the people i've personally talked to that use Perl (please don't take that personal, i'm well aware that there are A LOT of good programmers out there):<p>- Typically too lazy to learn a new language or even new paradigms (often enough aren't interested in OO style programming or even basic best practices, code conventions, some of them i had a hard time to even convince using a VCS!)<p>And you don't believe how many people like this are out there (not related to Perl, but in every area)!<p>A basic problem: Perl allows them to hack away all day and write hideous code that ensures they will never get fired. Due to their laziness the script will be undocumented, lack basic error checking, will have myriads of bugs and often fail, but no one except them will be able to fix it in a reasonable time frame.<p>This is where you will be upset and think i am really unjust and a troll: I'm stating that Perl supports this behavior like no other language. (except maybe brainfuck ;) )<p>My basic statement about Perl: It is possible to write readable, tested and maintainable code in Perl. BUT it is hard if not impossible with just the base language. It is by far easier to get it wrong then to get it right in Perl for the newcomer or average programmer.<p>> What you said has nothing to do with what you quoted. CPAN allows you to email those authors and the vast majority will reply happily. And even in cases where they don't, it's easy to go on irc.perl.org and ask around in #perl.<p>I must admit that i didn't write a mail to an author. I don't consider this a good way to discuss problems with modules anyway, since this results in closed discussion and won't help anyone with the same problem in the future. A forum, bugtracker or other means of collaboration software is far better suited for this, IMO. This may be a nice addition to CPAN, imo, having discussions on the modules.. probably linked on the module page.. Just dreaming here.. :)
At the end (as i have said) CPAN is probably the biggest advantage of Perl.<p>>> It is perfectly true. See this post for elaboration: <a href=""http://hackerne.ws/item?id=3238662"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackerne.ws/item?id=3238662</a><p>""there is nothing like it"" states that CPAN is unique in every way, and it is not!<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1693529/list-of-top-repositories-by-programming-language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1693529/list-of-top-repos...</a><p>> Did you try asking around? Look for alternatives? Often that is because the remaining bugs are no dealbreakers (license nitpicks anyone?) or the modules have been determined to be crap (XML::Simple).<p>I don't want to ask around for two weeks, i want to work and get started. Time is money.
Config::Simple (is it crap too? i don't know now anymore) contains quite some bugs that are marked as important for a few years now. 
So a module is stopped being developed and determined as being crap but how do i know that from the look at CPAN?!
I'm not sure if i should go on here and just search CPAN for other modules for example. I can't really convince you here but the overall feeling of browsing CPAN for modules is that there is a lot of old and outdated stuff in there, no discussions, no way to tell what is best to use, what is maintained. If you don't see it like that, then ok, but that's not only my impression. I looked at the CPAN statistics page but unfortunately i can't find usable statistics for my cause. Is there a statistic that shows the average time since the last update for all modules over the years? May be not a good statistic.. mhh... Amount of new package versions uploaded overall? Amount of fixed/open bugs? A TOP100 of most active modules?<p>> `use warnings FATAL => 'all';`<p>Tried that, but somehow it didn't work for everything, i'm not sure if some module was misbehaving.<p>> `my @hits = grep { $_ eq 'dogfood' } @array;`
> Alternatively:
> `use List::Util 'first'; my $has_dogfood = first { $_ eq 'dogfood' } @array;`
> And this is in core.<p>I think i was picking on the ""search"" too much, actually i meant the whole handling of arrays. Try to remove an item in the middle. Try to find which position element X has and delete or move this element. Stuff like that. It's really not as nice as in pretty much every other major language. The hint at List::Util is good but List::Util is really just a small list of functions.<p>Example: Looking for an element and deleting it? (Taken from perlmonks.org)<p><pre><code>  my @array = qw( your array here );
  my $search_for = ""here"";
  my( $index )= grep { $array[$_] eq $search_for } 0..$#array;
  splice @array, $index, 1
</code></pre>
I'm sorry, but this is hideous, really. Just to show you an example of what ""modern"" languages can do:<p><pre><code>  >>> array = [""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d""]
  >>> search = ""b""
  >>> array.remove(search)
  >>> print array
  ['a', 'c', 'd']
</code></pre>
> Fun fact<p>Unforunately i have read this statement in a magazine about Perl 6 and some tutorials for it. I don't have this magazine anymore but it's a quite respected IT journal in germany (i'x from Heise). I am trying to find prove.<p>> Well how nice to show at the end at least that you're a troll.<p>Sorry to have wasted your time, then. No, honestly.

</code></pre>
To which i have to say that both the Great Unicode Shootout as well as that answer are written by the same person. The point being: Yes, Perl's Unicode support is not perfect. But honestly? It's still the best you can get out there.<p><pre><code>  > >Exceptions are built in:
  > 
  > Exceptions are built in?
</code></pre>
The both of you are conflating two things here:<p>- Exception flow control
- Exception objects<p>The former is in fact implemented in Perl core via eval { literal code block }. In earlier versions of Perl there were issues where DESTROY blocks, called on object destruction, were able to clobber $@, i.e. the error message. Thus Try::Tiny has become the preferred method of doing exception flow control:<p><pre><code>  my $x;
  try {
      die 'foo';
  }
  catch {
      warn ""Got a die: $_"";
  } 
  finally {
      $x = 'bar';
  };
</code></pre>
Mind, that issue has been fixed in 5.14 ( <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/perl5140delta.html#Exception-Handling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perldoc.perl.org/perl5140delta.html#Exception-Handlin...</a> ), so if you're above that, you can safely use eval for your exception flow control.<p><pre><code>  > does it support ""bubbling up"" the exceptions over different modules?
</code></pre>
Yes, evals can be nested.<p><pre><code>  > What if a module redefines signal handlers?
</code></pre>
If it does it via local it won't even concern you. If it does it plainly you're in a bit of a bind, but in practice this kind of thing happens exceedingly rarely on CPAN outside of self-contained applications or testing/installing code.<p><pre><code>  > I'm also not sure how the error message can be handed
  > over multiple exceptions
</code></pre>
You die with an array reference containing the interesting exceptions.<p><pre><code>  > or how to catch different types of exeptions.
</code></pre>
If you know what kind of exception you expect, you write code that interrogates the scalar for that. For example, if you're expecting an object of a certain type:<p>handle_exception( $_ ) if blessed( $_ ) and $_->isa('Exception::Parse');<p><pre><code>  > Finally, why are there myriads of Exception modules and
  > Error handling modules and die/croak/carp modules
</code></pre>
Because we're collectively still trying to decide how to best handle exceptions.<p><pre><code>  > I never came across the need of looking for a 
  > replacement for those in another language...
</code></pre>
In other languages you get a solution plopped in front of you and have to accept it because you cannot even implement your own exception handling. If they got it right, great. If they didn't ... welp.<p>Anyhow, that was only the first part. The second part is Exception Objects, which is where a lot of the various CPAN modules come in. Since Perl does not provide a native exception object, you can return literally anything you wish and many people experimented to see which kind of exception object they wanted. The concensus for this has landed on Exception::Class.<p><pre><code>  > Another point is: Very often i came across the

</code></pre>
Those recommendations are bullshit and that's where you're right. However the fact that you think Perl does not have tools to search through arrays shows a glaring gap in your knowledge. As i mentioned in another comment, Perl has excellent facilities for searching through arrays:<p><pre><code>  > `my @hits = grep { $_ eq 'dogfood' } @array;`
  > 
  > Alternatively:
  > 
  > `use List::Util 'first'; my $has_dogfood = first { $_ eq 'dogfood' } @array;`
  > 
  > And this is in core.</code></pre>",1321442740

power analysis (side channel) attack vectors versus cryptanalysis attack
vectors against well vetted algorithms. The difference can be staggering
as you mentioned.<p>The issues I take with calling the requirements ""quite low"" are two
fold; (1) Most people could never succeed with this attack vector, and
(2) Most people would never bother. This certainly isn't ""FireSheep""
which really does have ""quite low"" requirements, and getting free bus
passes in San Francisco is certainly not worth the time, expense, and
effort, so most people would ever bother to do it.<p>BTW, I've collected some interesting papers and whatnot on side channel
attacks. If you want them, email me, but knowing you, you probably
already have most of them. ;)",1321441714

3242645,comment,3241335,3242576,1,0,glimcat,,,"""C is faster"" is a tired argument. The ability of this compiler or that to produce the most efficient possible code is almost never relevant outside of a few niche cases. Even UHF finance is such that the fractional return in computation time that you may get from using C isn't worth the development overhead. There are any number of great reasons to use C, but speed is rather outdated.<p>In this case, you're also guilty of putting optimization before the algorithm. Squeezing out the last clock cycle doesn't matter when you have raw data in one hand and some high-level objectives in the other. Effective machine learning is more about finding ways to obtain and reduce data into a useful form, and finding ways to map between your design goals and workable algorithms. Speed is the last step, and often the only one which can be improved by throwing money at it.<p>Besides which, if you want to have a pissing contest about speed, C is still going to lose to FPGAs. If it's that important, hire someone who knows Verilog.",1321441513

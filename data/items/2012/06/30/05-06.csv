4180839,comment,4179426,4179426,3,0,gruseom,,,"This is a perennial problem. It's a form of insecurity that can cross into intellectual bullying. Often (usually? always?) the person doing it is unaware that they are doing it.<p>I think you and your friend are exactly right that the solution is to make a conscious choice not to be that kind of person. That's what I did when I was your age, and I've tried to stick to it. But the key word is ""conscious"". If you're not conscious that you're doing it, you can't make a conscious decision to stop. What determines that? I think it's a matter of growth: when someone is ready to grow in that way, they will. It can't be forced from the outside. But if <i>you</i> do it, you get good at setting other people at ease, and this helps make your environment more welcoming.<p>The feeling of constant inner intimidation is common. I have it all the time. You have scott_s's evidence (edit: among others) as well (and you should stick around here long enough to know that scott_s's evidence is significant!) It varies in intensity. One has moments of crushing self-doubt. For the most part, it's a background process. It seems to be normal for some value of ""normal"", like a wry playmate one is stuck with who never goes away. It's so common among creative people that it may be connected to the creative process. The solution seems to be to know that more or less everyone feels it and get on with one's work.<p>I really like Hugh Macleod's line: ""Never compare your inside with somebody else's outside."" We all do that painful comparing, but it's an illusion because of the fallacy involved: we experience our own inadequacies acutely and downplay our achievements, while doing exactly the opposite with others'. (Actually it's worse than that because we have access to our own streaming self-critical monologue and not theirs, so we're not even considering the same data. That's the genius of Macleod's phrasing.) It reminds me of a hilarious fortune cookie a friend used to keep on his office door: ""A wise man can see more from the top of a mountain than a fool from the bottom of a well."" We're the fool in the well and the other guy is always the wise one on the mountain.<p>Finally, if you think the know-it-alls are in a stronger position, observe them more closely. If they truly felt they were that smart, they wouldn't be trying so hard to prove it. It's a weak position and not a good place to be in the long run, regardless of how many people they overpower in arguments and status matches.",1341035638

People aren't upset about the old ""stricter guidelines"" you are quoting, they are upset about the new ones.<p>It was poor judgement and poor PR to lob that out there before they were ready to actually spell out what these new ""stricter guidelines"" are.  It creates fear, uncertainty and doubt among Twitter API developers and they are getting sick of fear, uncertainty and doubt, its been going on for a long time now.<p>Twitter's message bus, API and identity system have become  valuable Internet resources.  But Twitter has never been particularly great at thinking of innovative uses for it or developing great clients. There are a lot of really interesting and different ways to use those, regrettably they are trying to kill most of them and inflict a homogonized, boring, monoculture on their user base they can monotize, which will make the experience progressively worse.<p>At this point I imagine most API developers are wishing there was a new message bus they could move to but its a daunting challenge to field one, even more daunting to get a critical mass of messages moved over to it to make it interesting, and  really daunting to fund it without resorting to all the lameness Twitter is now knee deep in.",1341035158

4180758,comment,4180150,4180283,27,0,sedev,,,"The takeaway lesson for me is that <i>user-generated content is incompatible with advertising.</i><p>Now, as a caveat, I'm the sort of person who thinks that modern advertising is 99% toxic sludge in the mental environment: I am firmly in the Kalle Lasn camp. However, here's how I see it working: users come to the site because of the UGC, but advertising, by nature, has to grab attention at some level. You can't design for both ""make the UGC, stuff users actually care about, primary"" and ""make sure that you get ad clickthroughs."" Since the latter pays the bills, it tends to win - and users tend to leave because on one level or another, it's obvious that the site isn't about them (and if your site depends on UGC, your users ain't wrong to think that the site should be about them!)<p>The secondary takeaway is that <i>advertising is not a long-term sustainable business model.</i><p>Advertising has a strong tendency to push startups into this insular turtles-all-the-way-down bullshit: social media with ads for analytics, analytics for ad-based startups, startups about how to reach demographics, and so on. They're as familiar an archetype around here as Punch & Judy. But it's all the tertiary economy, it's all flash: the fundamentals of advertising as a business model only get weaker over time. The effectiveness of advertising <i>at all, in any context</i> is debateable, and participating it is participating in an endless arms race. I argue that this should tell us that advertising is not the way to go if you want to build a lasting company: you need to take money in exchange for goods and services (real goods and services: advertising doesn't count, as I'm in the process of arguing).<p>That's hard! That's really difficult. PayPal, Square, and WePay should show us how ridiculously, gratuitously difficult the ""take money for"" part is, and taking people's money once you've convinced them that you've got something worth their money, is the <i>easy part!</i> Before you even get there, you have to build something good, and none of us should have any illusions that that's easy. Then between those two parts, there's ""persuade users that your cool thing actually is cool and worth paying money for,"" and sweet leaping Buddhas that's a lifetime of work in itself (the lifetime of work, in fact, that advertising is doing in such a toxic and commons-destroying way right now).<p>But: you are a <i>hacker.</i> You are a <i>hustler.</i> You are an <i>engineer.</i><p><i></i><i>Solving hard problems is your job.</i><i></i><p>Advertising is not a business model: advertising is a problem to be solved. Advertising is a bullshit legacy of past business models, here to be disrupted. The reason that I hang out on Hacker News is that I believe that its hackers, hustlers, and engineers are the people who can look at the way we do something now, think ""that suck! I can do better than that!"" and then do the difficult, frustrating, painful work to actually make something better, show people why it's better, and accept the monetary rewards that come from having made something better and proved it.<p>We can do this.",1341033433

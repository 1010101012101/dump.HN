See, if I were to reside in Syria and to simply post antigovernmental sentiments online, I very well might end up dead. I would not end up dead (not necessarily) were I to succeed in posting anonymously (let's simply say, 'under a pseudo + (somehow) hidden IP address'). 'Anonymous' here for me simply means 'my online identity [which can post things, read things, whatever] is not connected to my real identity', where 'real' can usually be simply be evaluated to 'my real name' and/or 'my physical location'. I would be too afraid to (merely) invent fake pseudonyms on FB - what if Syrian gov't were to succeed and subpoena FB (who knows) and acquire my IP address? Anonymity would matter very much to me!<p>However, at the same time I see what you mean. In this case, anonymity is a free speech obstruction circumvention tool, in a (limited) sense. Perhaps I'm a pessimist who does not really believe in free speech really being possible. (The regimes are simply extreme cases/illustrations of this.) :)",1367452332

I got a bunch of parts off Craigslist from a guy, got some stuff off eBay, I was in college at the time so I never really had time to do anything with it (and money was tight), so I couldn't get it finished. But in college I saw some 3D printers, decided I wanted one.<p>Moved back home with my parents, christmas / birthday was coming up. I was looking into some printers (I was going to get the Solidoodle 2) to get. I was talking to my friend about it one night, said to myself ""Whatever, I'll just make it!"" (not sure why that thought popped in my head). 6 weeks after that, I have this thing: <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/FZfp9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/FZfp9</a> in my room. Wish I would have documented the build process better.<p>I wanted one because I'm making a cool product and needed to make some cases for it.<p>I use LinuxCNC to run it with a HobbyCNC stepper driver board, and it actually works pretty well! If I could make one 'enhancement' for it, I would make native gcode arcs work in slic3r, as I can hit 60-80 mm/s on a straight away, but around corners it gets to ~25 mm/s.<p>I've found two 'killer' uses. My nieces and nephew come over, they want to make something (my nephew asked for keys one day). We pulled up thingiverse, he picked one out that he liked, 45 minutes later he has keys.<p>The second one is being able to design something and see it almost instantaneously. Is this going to fit? How does this look? Would it work better this way? You don't need to sit and twiddle your thumbs for so long, as you can test out a ton of ideas.<p>One of the pains is the calibration for this thing - I made this script (which definitely needs some work) <a href=""https://github.com/MercuryRising/dic3r"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/MercuryRising/dic3r</a> to aid in calibration. You can calibrate your build plate (it makes a skirt of your platform size, so you can even it out while it's running) and I think it does extrusion multiplier calibration. The one thing that I think is really cool for it is variable density (specify a Z height to merge two different slices of stl).

LSM trees tend to be faster for inserts and for write-heavy applications, and they offer very fast reads and writes for frequently-accessed data.  They also depend upon the <i>bandwidth</i> of the disk rather than the seek time, and bandwidth has of late been increasing significantly faster than seek times.  OTOH, they offer very variable latency, as an insert might trigger a major compaction, while B+ trees have a bounded latency limit.  A lot of the distributed systems work at Google (a big user of LSM trees via BigTable) comes from the need to work around the poor 99th percentile latencies of LSM trees.",1367449671

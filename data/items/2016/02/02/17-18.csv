We realized with remote teams and a lot of visual content, it is very hard to share feedback on emails, so zipBoard was born. As we started working on it, we realized that the same is applicable for any web based product that is created. For every iteration, there is a need to gather constant feedback from the stakeholders. It is not always possible to huddle in the same room or to add bug for each feedback. Do share what are your thoughts about the product.",1454435995

If a simple bundler plugin could deal with getting rid of everything in lodash they aren’t using, footprint is one less thing we’d have to worry about.<p>If you use Google CDN, why does it matter how big jQuery is? If N people use their own &quot;smaller&quot; M-byte copy of jQuery, browsers will have to download M*N bytes, as opposed to 0 bytes if you use the cached full version.

11021067,comment,11020652,11020652,0,0,shas3,,,"Interesting article! However, Deep Blue, Watson, and AlphaGo are very different from one another. I don&#x27;t think anyone deemed beating humans at chess or jeopardy impossible at the time Deep Blue and Watson were built. On AlphaGo the point about generalizing AI is valid, yet I think the author doesn&#x27;t fully appreciate the novelty of approach described in the AlphaGo paper. Their work advances the field, has more general utility than Deep Blue&#x27;s chess or Watson&#x27;s jeopardy programs. AlphaGo paper specifically represents an advance in machine learning algorithms for games in general. As I understand, Watson&#x27;s new NLP algorithm is PRISMATIC [1]. PRISMATIC is a rule-based NLP system and AlphaGo is more statistical inference/neural networks. Even if AlphaGo&#x27;s &#x27;policy-network- value-network&#x27; framework is not too generalizable, the philosophical implication is that we can build AIs that can mimic &#x27;human intuition&#x27;. Jeopardy and chess have lesser components of &#x27;human intuition&#x27; than Go. They are apples and oranges. So, I wonder if the author errs in bringing Deep Blue and Watson-Jeopardy into the picture.<p>In my opinion while Watson-Jeopardy and Deep Blue were &#x27;over-fitting&#x27; for Jeopardy and chess respectively, AlphaGo algorithms are more general and over-fits for the larger category of &#x27;games&#x27;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://brenocon.com/watson_special_issue/05%20automatic%20knowledge%20extration.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brenocon.com/watson_special_issue/05%20automatic%20kn...</a>",1454435735

I&#x27;ve known some trolls who are easily among the smartest, sanest people in the world, and who are totally normal in all other aspects of their lives. Some are dear friends. This activity has been described in these terms by more than one of them. Countercultural behavior is practically a rhythm throughout history, and trolling is the Internet&#x27;s counterculture, which can be mean because of anonymity. Some people go too far with it, yes. Some people go too far with anything, though.<p>My point is be careful ascribing psychological illness to something you do not understand. <i>That</i> is crazy. Trolls don&#x27;t care what you think. If you and many others respond by calling them crazy, what are you really saying? Think about it. Appealing to a good and decent society that ought to do something about this menace is pretty strange, too.<p>I have trolled before. I&#x27;m not good at it, but I have. I can vouch for the positive feeling it produces and I&#x27;ve come to terms with what that means about me and my self. This is the thesis of numerous psychological works as well as, say, <i>Fight Club</i> (it&#x27;s uncanny how well that story fits the big points I hit on, including taking it too far and plurality of self, and I don&#x27;t think anyone disagrees that Palahniuk was onto something).",1454435403

Nice work! Some of the Swift- and NS-isms are tricky to follow without knowing Mac dev, and I&#x27;m still wrapping my head around how it all wires together, but especially the update loop is very clear and small and I think a unique use of Rx to blend into React/virtual-dom/Elm ideas.<p>My perspective is I am trying to bring the Elm Architecture to F# but started out porting virtual-dom.js on the bottom. It&#x27;s early and ugly and just at the point of having to deal with patching children nodes, so parts of this are quite relevant. One avenue I intend to check out is performing set operations on a flat node list and using something like protocol methods on parent views to add and remove children, so that part of the code is definitely going to trigger some thoughts.<p>The dictionary of observables indexed by node threw me at first. AFAICT the virtual views, action types, and updates all compose, and then once it&#x27;s time to do anything with real views (the patch operation in diff/patch terms) just that part is handled independently per node? (EDIT: Ah, I see the context dispatch is composed as in Elm, and only pushing down model updates is separate.) It&#x27;s dead easy compared to the work virtual-dom.js has to do to index patches, index DOM nodes, and walk the DOM applying updates. This seems to handle all that with much less code, with a couple caveats:<p>1) The ability to reorder children is missing, right?<p>2) Any plan to support laziness to curb rerendering sections of the virtual tree? It&#x27;s probably not needed for many apps, but for some reason the feature gets air time in discussions around React and Elm. (Looks like all observables get called\nunconditionally once per update, too?)<p>[1] - <a href=""https://github.com/chriseidhof/tcp-json-swift"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chriseidhof/tcp-json-swift</a>",1454434443

What you are asking for is unreasonable. There is no way immigrants can ever completely assimilate to that degree. The cultural gap and linguistic distance is simply to big.  It doesn&#x27;t help that Japan has historically been isolationist and based on anecdotal evidence, still seems to be pretty xenophobic. At best, you could hope for a compromise, where the immigrants do their best to integrate, and hosts make compromises and try to be more accomodating. You could try taking immigrants from nearby regions where the gap is conceivably smaller, but politics and history will get in the way.<p>Ultimately there seems to be no good solutions on the horizon. You will just have to pick the least worst from a selction of poor ones:-<p>1. Ignore the problem and see what happens.\n2.

If the purpose of this blog post was to argue for a more reserved tone in scientific press releases, and support that view by challenging the significance of a study described in such a release, the blogger made an absolutely awful decision in their choice of which paper to make an example of.<p>Drugs used to treat schizophrenia today have the same molecular mechanism as compounds discovered serendipitously 60 years ago. In the intervening time we’ve seen no innovative drugs, and no new biomarkers — a sad lack of progress at a time when we’ve made enormous progress in treatment of cancer and cardiovascular disease. At the same time, pharma companies have exited neuropsychiatry in droves – despite enormous unmet need – citing lack of scientific foundations.<p>Because, see, drug developers don’t just just count Google Scholar hit results; they need to have a real understanding of mechanism with a solid experimental basis. Neuroskeptic’s abstract-counting seems to imply that every paper in PubMed reflects a major advance, but this confuses quantity with quality. Others feel that the view from the “shoulders of giants” is not especially clear. While it’s true that thousands of papers about schizophrenia have been published, many of them followed false leads, described failed animal “models”, or told genetic ‘just-so’ stories.<p>The Sekar et al. discovery in Nature connected the human genome&#x27;s largest influence on risk of schizophrenia with a molecular mechanism that would explain the age of onset and major pathological observations. That&#x27;s a major advance. Many others (including NIMH Director Cuthbert, and well-known GWAS skeptic David Goldstein) also called it a major advance (e.g., see Goldstein’s News and Views in Nature.)<p>I agree with them. Given that this paper not only points the way toward a novel risk gene but provides convincing evidence of molecular mechanism, it should be considered an unprecedented advance. (Unless the blogger feels like well-studied, potentially druggable pathways have been implicated by recent work on this disease; if so, they were not mentioned in the original post).<p>The press release doesn’t say that Sekar et al identified the “first schizophrenia risk gene”, but rather that it was &quot;the first time that the origin of this devastating psychiatric disease has been causally linked to specific gene variants <i>AND</i> a biological process” [emphasis mine]. This isn’t just another lab reporting a locus identified in GWAS. Instead, this is a situation in which a team of (very) clever geneticists analyzed a (very hard to analyze) set of genetic variants and then showed that the protein encoded by the risk allele has a molecular activity pertinent to an established (but heretofore unexplained) disease phenotype. This paper is an interdisciplinary tour de force, and it is philistine to detract from the magnitude of the authors&#x27; achievement in the service of quibbling about the tone of a press release. In any case, the basic claim of that release is true: Literally no one else has published research like this.<p>Beyond that, I&#x27;m puzzled by the implication that major advances in an extensively studied field are less important because they confirm (or deny) widely discussed models. In any event, hypotheses are different from experimental confirmation. The idea that excessive synaptic pruning is involved in schizophrenia has indeed been discussed in many papers (although most of those 3000+ mentions are one-liners and asides that cite a handful of originating papers).<p>Pardon my caps, but THAT IS EXACTLY WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT. The idea that SCZ could involve excessive synaptic pruning is so provocative and exciting that thousands of authors have decided to mention it in their papers, but before Sekar et al, we had no idea about the underlying molecular mechanism. Now we have not just a candidate mechanism, but one that unifies a great many disparate findings and points the way toward both further genetic research and rational design of therapeutics.<p>The Internet makes it easy for us to nip at the ankles of giants, especially from behind the cover of a pseudonym, and lately it’s been fashionable to pile on Eric Lander for doing basically what any chair is supposed to do: popularize the work of scientists affiliated with his institution. Also, granted, press releases could be toned down. But this paper is the wrong place to plant that flag; this is the wrong hill to die on. This paper is gigantic, and it’s easy for me to see how it could go down in history as a turning point in what was once a hopeless battle.",1454432975

When it rolls the contracts, it sells 100 barrels for $2000, and buys 95 barrels, with $5 left over.<p>Fast forward a month.  Prices have gone up by $1 for all months oil.  It will sell 95 barrels for $22 ($2090, plus the prior month&#x27;s leftover $5) and buy 91 barrels for $23, with $2 left over.<p>Fast forward another month.  Let&#x27;s say you owned the entire fund and decided to liquidate it.  Prices for your contract have gone up another $1, so you sell your 91 barrels for $24, receiving $2184, and adding the extra $2 in cash you had gives you $2186.  That&#x27;s a 9.3% return in two months.<p>Compare that to the price of oil as reported in the news - it&#x27;s the front month contract, so on the face of it, oil has gone from $20 to $24 (20% increase) while you&#x27;ve only made 9.3%.<p>The numbers are somewhat exaggerated here, and it can work the other way (current month more expensive than forward month) but is uncommon.  This is why USO has historically been a bad long-term proxy for the price of oil.",1454432401

I have nothing against public breast feeding but I don't need to see dozens of photos of you doing it. If you think it is a mundane activity that should be more socially acceptable don't share it on Facebook, you're sensationalising it.<p>And if it matters to you that they can share any content without risk of it being pulled, start a blog.

When you are producing, you stretch your mind.  Not only do you have to think about how to meet your goal, you have to think about what you are producing in context of value and other people.

Allow Node to do it's thing (<i>So the server has multiple threads.  If a handler blocks in one thread, another thread can pick up incoming requests.</i>).<p>It's aggrieving that this model requires any given handler to be able to service any given request, tbh. Shared state is a folly.

But it does still require thread-interruption. If the worker thread can yield frequently and resume, finding the answer might be a small enough invisible enough calculation to help plaster over there being interruptions altogether; that's essentially the hope.

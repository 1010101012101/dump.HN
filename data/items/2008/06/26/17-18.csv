Arrington and the rest of the crew at TC get requests all day long to be covered.  You will be lucky if you can be noticed amidst the sea of requests.  Your best bet is to just launch.  Create a corporate blog, have a twitter account, post comments on other related blogs.  Do the social thing and you will drive traffic and get noticed.<p>Ours is a different story, we launched privately with a beta key... we had to for what our product is.  We have to test the code and grow gradually because our product is very involved.  We do not want to be covered today in TC, maybe in 8-12 weeks (although we did apply for the TC50.  :D).<p>Take it slow and grow.<p>Chris",1214502859

One of the principal components will be g, provided you have enough data. This is what defines g.<p>Intelligence tests are simply tests designed to be more highly correlated with g. If we discarded intelligence tests, we could recreate them (or equivalent tests) based on statistical analysis of the other test data. They are certainly not arbitrary measures.<p>The external argument doesn't rescue g; g is quite safe. The external argument merely claims that 'g' and 'intelligence' are the same thing, or very close. g exists regardless of what you want to call it.<p>As for the paper you cite, I skimmed it. Unless I misunderstood it horribly, it merely claims that particular IQ tests don't effectively measure g across different groups.

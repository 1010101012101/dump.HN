Rich guys who get all this new money cannot buy 100x more food and toilet paper. What they can do is to buy expensive property all over the world (not very liquid, thus not affecting everyday prices much) and stocks.<p>Right now CPI does not change as much as USD supply changes, so people don&#x27;t worry. However, it does not mean this is not delayed and will hit down the road even if they suddenly stop printing new dollars.",1380128379

Is it really that big of a deal to move between your car and your airplane?<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that <i>airplanes need a preflight inspection before you fly</i> if you&#x27;re not suicidal, and having just driven the airplane to the airport doesn&#x27;t eliminate that need. Quite the contrary: being exposed to the stresses of driving will <i>increase</i> the need for a preflight inspection.<p>The time-consuming non-flying activities for an airplane are preflight inspection, flight planning, clearances, etc. A roadable airplane does nothing at all to help this.<p>Maybe you save two or three minutes out of your half-hour preflight activities. Whoopdedo. Meanwhile, you make up more than that lost time because your dedicated airplane is a better and faster airplane than the crazy &quot;flying car&quot;.<p>Sometimes you&#x27;re really just better off having separate objects doing what they do best. I don&#x27;t see any push for amphibious cars, for example. Everybody seems to have accepted that you&#x27;re better off buying a car and a boat separately. But somehow there&#x27;s an obsession with airplane/cars. I blame The Jetsons.<p>I could be wrong, but I&#x27;m going to need someone to give me some sort of <i>actual advantage</i> to one of these things before I might think I am.

Apple has run commercials promoting creation oriented tasks for the iPad. There is a tremendous consumption market for iPads, but Apple pretty clearly wants it to be a device used for creation as well.<p>If there is a difference in strategy here, it that Apple&#x27;s view of how a user should interact with a tablet interface is more direct. I.e., the sliders and buttons showcased on the example Blade would simply appear as interface elements on the display. The Blade idea follows a slightly different model where the tablet serves as a hybrid input/display. The up-side is that the Blade effectively doubles your input surface area. I think that appeals to a lot of people.<p>In short, I think Apple and Microsoft are promoting a lot of the same ideas here, but I think the Blade represents a bigger commitment to the creation side of the market.<p>I would assume that the HID (human interface device) API within the Surface&#x27;s operating system has good support for the development of peripherals like Blades.

While you may understand how the algorithm works, and even be able to step through and see how each neuron affects the whole, that doesn&#x27;t mean you know why the answer is correctly achieved through all of them combined.<p>The classic example is facial recognition.  Training a neural network for facial recognition will result in lots of neurons contributing a very small part of the whole, and only when all (or most) are involved is the answer correct.<p>To most people, this (emergent behavior) is &quot;magic&quot;.",1380125298

I got caught up in ranting about it, because it looks and feels so cool, but is so infuriating to use. What I was hoping to get across is that adding these to the surface don&#x27;t make it any more practical, and don&#x27;t address the existing problems with the surface and its keyboard. Without the Surface, this is nothing new (custom input devices are common).<p>More about the article:<p>One of the best parts of touch based interfaces is they can change with context and can be customized/improved/fixed for the cost of changing the software. No need to ship a physical 2.0 for your POS when you want to change the button layout.<p>Also, with these blades, are you expected to carry around more than one and swap them out based on the activity? Then use the onscreen keyboard when you need to do any text input?<p>The thing is a computer. It has a USB port. One can attach whatever input devices they want. The only difference about a blade is that this doubles as a screen cover. In the medical and fast food examples he gives, the machines are stationary (and you probably want them to stay that way).<p>I&#x27;m all for dedicated input devices or customized interfaces to make jobs easier, but that&#x27;s hardly a new idea.",1380125260

Tech to &quot;previsualize&quot; objects &quot;in camera&quot; has been around a long time and is in pretty wide use. Avatar used it very heavily, for example.<p>It&#x27;s important to realize that what happens in post is a whole lot more than making a 3d object and placing it in the scene. We do a lot of integration work in 2D by hand to match things like color, edges, etc. There&#x27;s massive amount of simulation work on water, fire, etc. Sometimes people straight-up paint on film frames in things like photoshop.<p>The big win with real-time visualization is the creative control for the direction and director of photography, who are generally far removed from the final product and this can cause expensive second-guessing all around.<p>Lastly, it&#x27;s a bit condescending to artists working on games to suggest that the painstaking work that goes into making/optimizing/QCing interactive content is something that can just happen on the fly.

I can easily, with one (chorded keystroke), see the definition of any symbol in my code, wether it be a local variable or a module. Similarly I can easily pull up docs, find any other usage of that symbol in the current file, etc. There is also high quality linting going on all the time, that will highlight things like unused variables, pep8 violations, etc.<p>Can you do all of this in VIM? Probably, but only with substantial effort.<p>As far as refactoring...IDEA goes way way beyond what you can do with grep.<p>For instance, say I have a function foo:<p><pre><code>    def foo(x):\n      return x * 2\n\n    foo(3)\n</code></pre>\nThis is a trivial example, but just go with it.<p>What if I decide I need to multiply by things other than 2... fine,<p><pre><code>    def foo(x, y): \n      return x * y\n\n    foo(3) # Ooops, syntax error\n</code></pre>\nNow, I can add y as an optional parameter,<p><pre><code>    def foo(x, y=2)\n</code></pre>\n... and that way I don&#x27;t break code I&#x27;ve already written. But that may not be what I want - maybe I want to force callers to explicitly specify both parameters.<p>That&#x27;s what refactoring comes in.<p>Refactoring -> Change Signature (Or just hit Ctrl+F6)<p>Now, add a new parameter, y, with a value of 2, and now any existing calls to foo across my entire project will have a second parameter of 2. No grepping or manual editing needed.  This works reliably over a huge codebase with hunderds of files. Lets see you do THAT with grep. That&#x27;s just a trivial example.<p>I can also easily extract a bit of code as a new function, and IntelliJ&#x27;s code analysis will detect any values I&#x27;m closing over and default to those as the function parameters, and replace the original call site with a call to the new function.

Most of them  say <i>testing</i> is important . Most of them  <i>don't</i> say ""semi automated"" testing is  ""essential"". So where is your perceived ""consensus"" of programming legends coming from?<p>or this<p>""TDD (writing the tests before the code): good in theory but alien to most folks""<p>for that matter? Sibel mentions 5 developers in his blog post - Zawinski, Knuth, Norvig, Bloch, Armstrong.  I didn't see anyone saying ""good in theory but alien to most folks"". Only Armstrong says he regularly does (soemthing like)  ""test driven"", but if you read his interview he also says he spends a lot of time doodling and getting his abstractions right before coding, hardly the ""YAGNI"" style of coding and theory of ""emergent design"" propounded by most agile consultants.<p>Who in CaW do you think concludes either of the two statements you put forward as ""general conclusions from programming legends"".<p>Or are you saying Robert Martin and co are programming legends? Bit hard to justify I'd think ;-)<p>You say,<p>""There still seems to be a general reaction here"" .. ""I'm too smart and/or busy to write tests"" and  the corollary ""Anyone who writes tests, or advocates testing, isn't a good programmer"".""<p>The former  "" I am too busy to write (TDD style) tests"" is a justifiable argument in certain circumstances (Zawinski says as much) and the latter ""Anyone who advocates testing is a poor programmer"" is something <i>I</i> don't see <i>anyone</i> here saying. Who said this? Links please? And if someone did, why do you think it is a ""general reaction""?<p>fwiw I see the evolving consensus here ) as ""writing unit tests is valuable in certain circumstances (and not so in others) as long as you aren't fanatical about them"" and ""what is important is not the methodology but the end result"".<p>You seem to be putting forward <i>your beliefs</i> about the value/validity of TDD/testing etc  as the ""general conclusion, from various programming legends"". I am curious as to how you came up with this apparent consensus.<p>Don't get me wrong, you certainly have a right to your conclusions. I am just saying the CaW interviews and the posts here don't seem to converge to a conclusion along the lines of  you say they did.",1254825651

What do you mean?<p>Well, as already mentioned this is not the first time an article has appeared on the HN. Not a bad thing. But lets look a little closer.<p>Like him or hate him Tim Farris has reviewed these. I used to like reading his blog until I couldn't help feel 90% of his stories were there to push you to buy something ( Lead Gen, no less from another article in the top 30 today ) or left you wondering if he was paid to write that story.<p>The New York times has ran at least two articles related to these shoes.<p>Wired has an article and a review.<p>There is a chance that they are being discovered on the merit for what they may or may not be. I don't live in an english speaking country. Equally I am a huge running fan. I am yet to see any here, not even in boutique shops. ( Oslo Norway ) So I wonder how these amazing shoes are only being discovered in mainstream tech ( type ) sites which are aimed at a particular market.<p>So I googled it a little.

863829,comment,863219,863752,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"The plural of anecdote is not data, but when I worked at ThoughtWorks, Martin sent me some code to look at. It was very clean OO code (very smalltalk-ey in design and form, thought it was written in Ruby). The man <i>can</i> code well (not to the level of say Peter Norvig, but then not many of us can) and competently  and is very sharp and when he gets hands on, solves problems fast.It is true that he doesn't have any code  online where we can look at it.<p>Another admirable trait I've witnessed is his willingness to say ""I don't know"" when asked questions outside his circle of competence. He often says it very bluntly (which has caused some heartburn to some ThoughtWorkers once in a while, but that is another story).<p>His ""Enterprise Patterns"" book is very useful for anyone working on enterprise software. I believe DHH was influenced by the book when he  was hacking Rails.<p>His upcoming book on rich gui apps seems promising too. Also he doesn't make outragoeus claims or adopt a condescending atitude to programmers who don't work the way he does/advocates (unlike say Robert Martin). <i>I</i> wouldn't dismiss him as a ""know nothing"" talker/blowhard.<p>As I said, just anecdotes.

863827,comment,863277,863277,0,0,bmcleod,,,"I'm of the opinion that Agile(Big A) is very useful for creating a system between companies. When something is an agreement between companies you need some agreed and consistent method of working out what happens when and enforcing that afterwards. Agile is much better in these circumstances than waterfall.<p>Comparatively, in a startup or internal development project in a software company there is much more of an ability to not deliver a particular feature or spend more hours on it.<p>A startup is likely to find Agile far too slow; whereas, corporates are scared by how fast and fluid it is.",1254824046

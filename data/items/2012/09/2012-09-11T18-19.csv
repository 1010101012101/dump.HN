It allows you to use the module pattern (very solid js pattern) and probably has less code than your method.<p>Also, javascript has closures, use them. this._private is a hacky java-esque way of doing things. return {public_methods...} is a solid way of working towards the strengths of the language and doing proper js encapsulation.<p>As for the prototype pattern, there are a million ways you can do that. Best to learn the fundamentals so you can use whatever works best based on the situation.<p>edit: I should add that one of the reasons I like JS patterns is that there are multiple correct ways to implement them based on the situation. There are many wrong ways too, of course :) but it is a very flexible language.",1347389966

If you got sick and had to pick a country to be treated in solely based on your health outcome, you'd be making a mistake to choose based on life expectancy. In the same vein: if you were picking countries based on quality of public transit nationwide, sure, life expectancy could be a counterintuitive and convoluted way to arrive at the right conclusion. But a look at an Amtrak schedule would tell you pretty much the same thing without the tea leaf reading. Everyone knows that Europe and Japan have denser public transit than the US.",1347389954

Like really badly designed.  I had a few email exchanges with one of their devs, but it didn't really seem to go anywhere.  You can't create subclasses of any of their objects because they like using static methods versus singleton instances.  It's really stupid and it really ties you to using parse.  You also have shit like this everywhere:<p><pre><code>    NSString *someval=[pfobject objectForKey:@""shit""];

You have the same side to side stability as a someone riding a bike.<p>Skateboards at speed have instability front to back (obviously your weight is back to guard against pebbles, etc..) but also side to side.  Keeping the death wobbles away takes a lot of practice.<p>Behind the Blazer I got up to 45Mph on my blades, but not even close to that on a skate board (with tight trucks and soft wheels).

4507077,comment,4492991,4493615,2,0,001sky,,,"Edit: If I may expand on the point above.  Which may seem cryptic.<p>Complex systems are interisting in that they can be both predictable (in theory) and not predictable (in practice). What's more is that they can be <i>mischaracterized</i> by analyzing the data. Ie, this data is a mess, it must me unpredictable.  There are a whole class of deterministic processes which generate these types of results. Whereas a normal, linear process can be infered from medium/high resolution data, even with higher-resolution data we can't infer the underlying logic of the complex system. We may, as a result, either oversimplify the model or proclaim the data to not support <i>any deterministic process</i> at all.  The classic example is the class of processes that exhibit sensitive dependance upon initial conditions. ie, variations on the notion of deterministic Chaos. Their sesitivity is such that the resolution of the dataset required to deduce or infer the origination function would never be feasible if it was anything other than complete.  Whereas, with deterministic processes that are more traditionally tractable, you can make progress in your knowledge with data-sets of increasing resolution. ie, you can run a regression to infer y=mx+b or a monte-carlo to fit a gaussian curve or what not.  But you cannot ""brute"" force a fit to a choatic process from a montecarlo, becaue you will never have enough resolution nor enough precision in your data set to infer an origination function. [1]<p>The summary thought is tha sometimes gaps in data can be bridged with higher-level logic or heristic, but this is not always possible (either in theory or practice). Yet, we should <i>not</i> infer a problem is unsolvable or untractable just because of this.  =D<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory#Sensitivity_to_initial_conditions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory#Sensitivity_to_ini...</a>",1347389108

What matters is whether that weight loss is sustainable in the long run.<p>Becoming fit is actually similar to becoming rich. Both are about having good habits that govern one's lifestyle. People who try to ""hack"" their way into weight loss end up gaining back that weight relatively quickly. Similarly, people who ""hack"" their way into richness end up either poor, or in jail, or both.<p>Bottom line is that in order to undo the effects of eating badly for years, you need to eat well and exercise for years.

4506910,comment,4502383,4503005,2,0,wam,,,"That's an interesting hypothesis, and worth looking into. If the group is a graph connected by people becoming aware of the campaign, participating in it, and forgetting about it, then there's a feedback loop that should taper off in a predictable way. This would gel with what seems to happen.<p>And as you point out, there's also a moment where the event becomes calcified, earning an entry into some wiki that records the biggest campaigns against individuals. This also seems to have the effect of permanently branding the individual so that if they do anything else perceived as a violation by a member of the group, a significant chunk of the network can reactivate quickly for a second round.<p>There's also a thin line between observation and participation. Someone might be passively aware of what's going on from reading 4chan or seeing it here, and they might comment, and the comment (maybe a suggestion) could galvanize the network to act in some way (call her employer). Each individual who does this may feel moral responsibility only for a trivial fraction of the damage. ""All I did was make one phone call. I'm not responsible for what other people do.""<p>Add that to a good technological mechanism for acting anonymously, and we get what we're seeing: a huge campaign of harassment unencumbered by moral and social concerns. Somewhat different from a family drama but not totally so. I'm sure there are sociological studies on how ""shunning"" works, but if you could get a hook into the numbers here, maybe there's a pattern that has general properties that subsume cases where people are more accountable and less anonymous.<p>The other question that interests me is whether there's a point in the ""ramping up"" side of the distribution where an active intervention of some kind can mute it.<p>The only criteria for participation in Anonymous, for example, is a commitment to the ""lulz"" at hand. If you're not in the current campaign, you're not provably in Anonymous. For example, just after the name began to be appropriated by people at the edges who were mostly interested in targeting scientology, and described in the news as a good campaign against a cult, we saw an attack on an epileptic support forum. This had the effect of purging people who claimed to be Anonymous but morally disavowed it. That's synonymous (hmm) with splintering the group, but the criterion of doing it solely for laughs was retained by one group and lost by the other. It'd be reasonable to call the former the ""core."" So there IS a form of accountability in Anonymous, and it operates strictly in the moral dimension of the action.<p>That would imply that both the ramping up and ramping down of a campaign is exactly the same as the size of the group (as defined by devotion to ""lulz"") at any given moment. Perhaps tautological, but different from a family. Apply this generally to all anonymous distributed groups. It also implies that an action that subverts the moral identity of the group can subvert a campaign. If you do something so reprehensible that a large contingent of the individuals in the campaign are compelled to disavow it, then you could effectively kill the distributed campaign. Is that a net win? Probably only if you convince enough people that you did it without actually doing it. Another possibility is to engineer a compelling distraction that draws in members of the campaign. But it seems to me that with enough knowledge, an individual or a smaller group can actively and deliberately affect the tapering off, either through manipulation of attention span or manipulation of moral alignment.",1347387185

4506881,comment,4505112,4505112,4,0,louhong,,,"I'll throw in my 2 cents as typical HN 'suit'. For background, I do have a technical co-founder and am working on something currently and we've been working together over a year and are on our second project.<p>First, I think the OP's response was perfectly acceptable. Its important as a technical co-founder to determine quickly what the ""suit"" can bring to the table although I do think he left out some valuable skills like marketing, user adoption, team building. He did include 'industry experience' which is critical. (edit: I also recall my co-founder then asking me situational questions like how I would market x app, who would use it, pricing, etc to see if I've thought through the process)<p>Second, one aspect that I see missing often is chemistry. Over the last few years I've attempted multiple projects with several different people and I can't stress how important chemistry is with your co-founder and/or team. I actually really enjoy hanging out with my co-founder and consider him a friend and we regularly hang out (with each other's families) and that kind of trust carries over to our work. Trust is something you can't quantify so for those in search of co-founders, don't just look at credentials but look at the person too.<p>My last thought is that although you're a 'suit' like I am, you need to make an effort. There is a general curve that says in the idea phase the majority of the workload is done by the technical co-founder. While true, I do my best to try and offset that. It gives me no joy to sit on my ass while my buddy is coding to 3am every night. How would it make you feel if you're busting your ass pitching, getting customers, and doing cust dev while they are at happy hour? So to respond to this I do my best. I've picked up basic design skills (PS/AI/FW), I've gotten his help to install ruby and learn basic HTML/CSS so I can make easy changes. I alternate every few days from doing something design centric, customer oriented (get feedback/lead gen), to thinking about our product direction.<p>So my take aways are: ask questions, figure out if you can work together, and make sure everyone is willing to put in the work to make it happen.",1347386902

Is ""desktop mode"" data plan going to be different than a ""mobile mode"" data plan?

But just because languages are computationally equivalent (cf. Turing), that doesn't mean one is as powerful/expressive as another. I can get things done a lot faster in Python than in Whitespace.<p>The boilerplate in Java is a huge drag on everyday coding, and Java has weak support for (among many other things) working with functions, text manipulation, and in some cases even basic arithemetic. You can make things work eventually, but sometimes the effort required and volume of resulting junk code is prohibitive for otherwise useful programming techniques.

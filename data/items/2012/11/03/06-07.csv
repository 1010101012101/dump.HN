Not a male / female thing, but that was a very marketable aspect, and (thus) the way I communicated the idea. It was butchered, but still sold $4m in books. The butchery got worse over two sequels. I seriously doubt that I will ever be able to communicate said idea (much less sell it) unless I can completely reconstruct its presentation.<p>Not saying that I disagree with the idea vs execution rhetoric here in the comments, I do agree... execution is more important. Execution in plant growing is more important than the seeds themselves... unless you lack the seeds.<p>Some here have said that at the right moment any arbitrary number of people will discover idea X. I would agree if the subtlety of the idea is not arbitrary, however the best ideas are unexpectedly early, and therefore subtle.<p>Do not mistake any of this as an argument for patents, or even fairness in a general sense.

I'd love to know more about Nate's model, but I trust it a hell of a lot more than the raw data of Gallup (seeing as Gallup's nearly the only one left giving him a chance. Dick back-peddaled today, Rasmussen did more or less too.)<p>Nate actually has a book about why this occurs and what it does to the conversation of politics in elections in the US.",1351922748

All four major browsers can run CLR code through Silverlight [1] and depending on the statistics you use, the installation base for the plugin is in the same ballpark as Java, somewhere between 65% and 75% [2]. StatOwl even has Silverlight slightly ahead of Java at 69.7% vs 70.0% [3].<p>Of course, these are desktop stats.

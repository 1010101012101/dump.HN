7861744,comment,7861306,7861690,2,0,NateDad,,,"You couldn&#x27;t write a generic tree that packs the ints closely together, no.  But you could write a non-generic tree that does.<p>Also, Dave was talking about Lists, which you certainly can have packed with ints trivially in Go.  And every piece of software I&#x27;ve worked on uses approximately a million times as many lists as trees.  Obviously, this is application-specific, but I think it&#x27;s pretty fair to say that most programs will use a lot more lists than trees.  If your application uses a lot of trees, Go is probably the wrong language for you, unless you&#x27;re willing to make a tradeoff by using code generation to generate type-specific implementations.",1402135159

7861717,comment,7860213,7860937,2,0,ronaldx,,,"> I would have thought nature would stop optimizing once a sting is a good enough deterrent.<p>I believe you are probably right about this: but the spider venom was probably developed in an arms race with some {predator/prey} species. In your &#x27;tarantula hawk&#x27; example, the venom must work on the tarantula, and the tarantula must do its evolutionary best to protect itself from the venom. This combination allows the venom to become extremely effective.<p>Or, given that it&#x27;s the black &quot;widow&quot;, maybe the venom is a result of sexual selection[0], which tends to have crazily extreme results. A spider fetish, if you like.<p>But, the sting/venom is not designed for humans (it just happens to work on them), and humans as a species have no reason to develop better protection. Humans typically aren&#x27;t a target of the bites and almost always recover with no long-term effect. It isn&#x27;t <i>really</i> designed to work on humans. But, it still hurts (and maybe that&#x27;s a nice side benefit for a reclusive spider).<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection</a>",1402134118

With Go, AFAIK, the problem is exactly the same. Can you write, say, a heap or a read-black tree that can store wither ints and strings, that will embed the ints? Also, value types are making it into the JVM in Java 9. I don&#x27;t think that will solve the packed representation in a generic data structure problem, but neither does Go. OTOH, Java does optimizations that Go never can. For example, Java can inline interface calls, which Go can&#x27;t (and due to the way Go defines interfaces, method calls are slower than Java even when not inlined in either).<p>Having said that, there are things about Go that I like better than Java: 1) no implicit primitive promotions (widening conversions), 2) a small standalone executable, 3) excellent start up time. The latter two make Go suitable for quick, small programs, like command line tools etc.<p>However, there are more things I like about Java the Go doesn&#x27;t have: 1) dynamic linking, 2) final variables, 3) concurrent data structures, 4) awesome monitoring and profiling tools, 5) generics, 6) state-of-the-art GC, 7) a polyglot VM (I also prefer Java&#x27;s exceptions and explicit interface implementation, but these are minor considerations).

I can&#x27;t seem to find it on this wooden bench.<p>Okay, that&#x27;s a downstream problem. For now, I&#x27;m going to pack these up and head home. But where do I put them? They&#x27;re an awkward shape. They look pretty easy to break.<p>What happens when I lose one of them? Is the entire system rendered useless? They look expensive to replace.<p>Are these yet more devices I&#x27;m going to have to charge? I&#x27;m already fed up of charging my laptop, phone, tablet, etc.<p>Are they going to protect the screen of my tablet device in transit? Looks like the opposite. I think I&#x27;ll hang on to the keyboard-cum-screen protector for now...<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF7EpEnglgk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF7EpEnglgk</a>",1402132817

The goal is to avoid injections, so you have to ensure that can&#x27;t happen. If you have a reliable way to quote/escape literals (values and identifiers might have different syntax for this) you&#x27;re good. It is risky, like all programming, to take matters into your own hands, but so is using a library you can&#x27;t understand. Good luck.",1402132049

He can legitimately make the claim that the overhead of a slice of ints is far smaller than an array of ints in Java.<p>You can add methods to an int in Go without any overhead by simply defining your own type that is backed by an int and then adding functions to that type. It still costs same.<p>Java performance for real-world, long-running, well written applications is greatly enhanced by an excellent JIT that improved performance over time. Go can be faster for looping over a list of integers while Java can win at branch prediction in complex code paths.",1402131994

So you have to seek out replacement cards that have drivers.  The worst is if your IDE controller doesn&#x27;t work and it can&#x27;t find the disk, but that was rare.  I guess I also had a motherboard here and there that would cause panics on boot.  But, the important point in all of this, is in those days it was <i>never</i> the case that the installation disk was actively trying to prevent you from booting.  You usually got somewhere, and the stuff wasn&#x27;t actively working against you, it was mostly just missing drivers.<p>And of course, today a stock distro kernel has more drivers in it than Windows or OS X, so it is a long time ago that you&#x27;re talking about.",1402131876

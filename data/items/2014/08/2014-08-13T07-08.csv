It&#x27;s just that the defense, in my opinion, is not difficult at all.<p>The main attack vector given by the talk is: device with an additional, unexpected, function. That&#x27;s the USB stick emulating a keyboard, or the smartphone presenting a  network device (which, by the way are functions  legitimately found on real hardware).<p>And the only defense against this is a stricter policy on what a computer will talk to, which again technically is binding of drivers. This defense can be implemented rather trivially.<p>The fact that a malicious payload itself reflashes the target is really a very nice hack, and I don&#x27;t want to belittle this in any way... But in the end, considering the huge amount of updates everybody installs all the time, it&#x27;s not surprising at all. I have several devices that reflash the connected device to match an updated driver... Of course we are not used to USB sticks doing that, yet.<p>The BIOS is a different problem, and I have no easy solution for that. But in my opinion it&#x27;s not as important, because in the normal use case (of the non technical user) an OS is running. (And in fact, e.g. on some cromebooks, the keyboard isn&#x27;t even looked at to boot faster if a special button isn&#x27;t pressed... So this could be a solution.).<p>A harddisk/stick tinkering with returned data is indeed one of the more interesting things, and has been used to root some devices that first verify a file, then read it again to execute it...

For the non-trivial ones, we closely examine everything we find or come across for potential overlaps to constantly assess its potential.  It is also true that these are very hard to find because people across the world have already worked on many different things.  Sometimes the unknowns involved do not resolve in your favor, as in, the technical solution you were investigating does not work out.  And this could very well mean that other people may already have tried that path too without resulting in a story that would be found over the Internet.<p>I have no reason to believe that &quot;such&quot; ideas are dime-a-dozen.

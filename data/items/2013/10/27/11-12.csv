Which is the magic rabbit Apple pulled out of a hat with the iPad, and Google seeks to emulate with Android.<p>The desktop is now irrelevant -- less than 10% of computing devices people use are desktops or laptops: it&#x27;s all gone mobile frighteningly fast -- but for what it&#x27;s worth, Linux won. Because the winning Linux desktop is actually a phonetop or tablet environment: Android.",1382875113

Out of the 100 editors I know only 2 left for Premiere, and they wouldve gone regardless of what Apple did. Others were already only using Avid, they never switched the Final Cut.

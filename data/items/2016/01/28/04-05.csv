His limit orders are more informative about &quot;hard&quot; news such as changes in the index future price than other traders, meaning he tries to buy stocks that are cheap and sell those that are expensive relative to the overall market, steering them toward their correct prices. This is just a simplistic HFT from almost a decade ago, modern prop traders have teams of researchers building prediction models with many more inputs.<p>And for all that, he earns a realized spread of 0.72 basis points, before paying for computers and employees. 1 basis point is 1/100 of 1%. That&#x27;s in 2008, a time when HFT was relatively new and competition was less fierce, margins are considerably lower these days, not like making 0.72 basis points is exactly robbing widows and orphans to begin with. No human would make a market for such low margins, no human could react nearly instantaneously to changes in the index/stock prices to set his quotes, and no human could trade hundreds of stocks at once.<p>How do you think HFTs cause flash crashes? If you look at the middleman&#x27;s net position on page 3, he never accumulates more than 10000 shares in one direction, and his position mean reverts every few minutes. How could a trader who primarily trades passively (others choose whether to elect his orders sitting on the book), never accumulates a significant directional position, quotes both buy and sell prices on the order book, and who aims to flatten his trades relatively quickly (whatever selling pressure he could create is quickly turned into buying pressure after he&#x27;s given a short position) have such a large impact on prices?<p>I don&#x27;t think trading off news feeds is a typical HFT trade. Some market makers may use these feeds to get out of the way during announcements. Maybe it&#x27;s an automated trade for hedge fund types, but it&#x27;s a high-risk, high-reward infrequent type thing. If a trader is incorrectly predicting prices long enough, they&#x27;ll lose money and go out of business.",1453956827

The threat—even an imagined threat—of a large bill made it difficult for poor people to focus on the cognitive tasks at hand.&quot;\nFinancial stress impedes human thinking / problem solving.

Good for corporate IT, bad for protecting yourself against malware.<p>The key insight is that Chrome itself is programmed to have quite-limited permissions—it not only heavily sandboxes itself, but it also does what it can to avoid requesting any powers from the OS that could be used to do damage in the first place, if one were to break out of the sandbox. (This also has the side-benefit that Chrome doesn&#x27;t need any of those &quot;scary&quot; UAC elevation prompts during installation, which probably helps their funnel to an extent.)<p>This means that Chrome actually doesn&#x27;t have any of the permissions required to weed out the GPOs responsible for feeding it malware extensions. Even if the Chrome process wanted to reach out and blow them away, it couldn&#x27;t. So they created this separate program, that <i>does</i> do &quot;scary&quot; UAC-elevation things, to help out.<p>(What they <i>could</i> have done is package this program into the Windows Chrome install, make it headless, and make a button in the Chrome settings that would spawn it and then interact with it over IPC, displaying the UI on the Chrome side. They could have, further, made it just-in-time download the component—as, IIRC, Firefox does with its Hello component—which would have eliminated any install-time size overhead to this approach.)",1453956349

That said - given the cost of living here in CA, I would assume that in the eventuality of becoming unemployed for an extended period of time, I couldn&#x27;t support myself with the basic income only and would need to look into moving to some less expensive areas. In fact, this is what was suggested in some discussion ( couldn&#x27;t find a link ) I remember reading relative to Finnish basic income experiment cited in some posts here. E.g. unless basic income would vary based on cost of living in your region, it would effectively result as people relying solely on it having to abandon living in more expensive cities and areas. Which seemingly is a notion few politicians would want to put forward when introducing basic income.

That&#x27;s his theory from the book Outliers (which I haven&#x27;t read) which argues that to become a true expert in something requires 10,000 hours of practice.<p>Now, say I wanted to become an expert in programming. To the point where I was an elite 10x developer. If I quit my job and lived off my savings, I could conceivably work on programming 100 hours per week. So after ten weeks I&#x27;d have 1000 hours, and after 100 weeks I&#x27;d have my 10,000.  So that&#x27;s two years or so at a minumum.<p>But living off savings for two years would be incredibly costly. Working full time would let me squeeze in say 20 hours a week, so I&#x27;d now take 10 years to reach the golden 10,000 hours or experience. If I cut down to a part time job, it would take 20 years.<p>I think the latter two are unrealistic because they take so long.  The 100 hour per week option is more of a possibility. With universal basic income, everyone would have the opportunity. If lots of people pulled it off, the productivity gains for society would be enormous.<p>Obviously there&#x27;s lots of people in society who have this sort of spare time and simply do not use it.

At first glance I thought it would be about the search engine, which would be a very disturbing thought indeed; it&#x27;s already hard enough to find the older, highly informative and friendly sites --- which often are plain HTTP.<p>Nevertheless, quite convincing security arguments aside, I feel this also has a very authoritarian side to it: they are effectively saying that your site, if it is not given a &quot;stamp of approval&quot; by having a certificate signed by some central group of authorities, is worthless. Since CAs also have the power to revoke certificates, enforced HTTPS  makes it easier to censor, control, and manipulate what content on the Web users can access, which I certainly am highly opposed to. I can see the use-case for site like banks&#x27; and other institutions which are already centralised, but I don&#x27;t think such control over the Web in general should be given to these certificate authorities.<p>With plain HTTP, content can be MITM&#x27;d and there won&#x27;t be much privacy, but it seems to me that getting a CA to revoke a certificate is much easier than trying to block a site (or sites) by other means, and once HTTPS is enforced strongly by browsers, would be a very effective means of censorship. Thus I find it ironic that the article mentions &quot;repressive government&quot; and &quot;censor information&quot; --- HTTPS conceivably gives <i>more</i> power to the former to do the latter, and this is very much not the &quot;open web&quot; but the centralised, closed web that needs approval from authorities for people to publish their content in.<p>There&#x27;s a clear freedom/security tradeoff here, and given what CAs and other institutions in a position of trust have done in the past with their power, I&#x27;m not so convinced the security is worth giving up that freedom after all...",1453954913

However, those plugins, whether Java, Flash, Silverlight or otherwise, have served a valuable purpose for a long time and they have developed a maturity far beyond any of the trendy modern technologies that are supposedly ready to replace them.<p>So, I have very mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, as someone who’s spent significant parts of the last decade developing UIs that included a Java applet, the experience has become horrible as it has become more and more troublesome to actually run Java code in a browser. It sucks for developers, and it sucks for users. None of us will miss that hassle.<p>On the other hand, except for when browser developers or Oracle have actively changed something, I’ve had applets doing interesting visualisations in GUIs where the code has worked fine for many years, with no changes needed other than <i>bona fide</i> new development. Such longevity is generally desirable, but it really matters if the GUI in question is served from an embedded device where taking something out of service to update firmware is an exercise measured not in minutes but in months.<p>Unfortunately, browser-native alternatives such as SVG just aren’t ready to replace those Java-based visualisations with the same degree of portability and longevity yet. I could write down a list of confirmed SVG bugs I’ve run into <i>just in this week</i> while building a new generation of one of those systems, and it would fill half my screen. I could file some bug reports, but it turns out that sometimes people already have, and they’ve been dismissed with WORKSFORME despite several other people reporting similar problems. And that’s just functionality that is theoretically supported, where the browsers tick all the summary boxes on sites like caniuse, before we even get into things like having at least three completely different techniques for doing animation but none that works everywhere. It’s also ignoring areas where even though the technology “works”, the performance is so bad when you scale things up that some browsers can’t cope.<p>I am not looking forward to the amount of time I’m going to be wasting over the next few years working around the endless browser incompatibilities and breaking updates, where the old plugin-based code would probably have just carried on working if no-one had undermined it. They’ve done it with Flash giving way to HTML5 media elements. Now they’re doing it with Java giving way to the likes of canvas and SVG. And yet I can’t help feeling that these are backward steps for those of us whose job is to build working web sites and apps, and will continue to be until these new technologies are a lot more mature and standardised than they are today.",1453954857

It could stop faster than it could accelerate. I can&#x27;t imagine driving a car with 1975 brakes, suspension, and cage, with even more horsepower. Even though the Delorean is probably heavier than the Z, so its top speed is probably not more than the Z, even with more power; the ability to stop and turn are also reduced by the increased weight.<p>It really does seem like a very bad idea.

(In fact, in the &quot;pure&quot; UBI most advocate for, these will take away <i>more</i> their social support than is possible today, since we&#x27;ll have also disassembled welfare, disability assistance, medicare, pensions, etc.)<p>---<p>Now, you&#x27;re right in that people&#x27;s needs vary. I don&#x27;t agree that (pure) UBI is the best possible solution to this problem; it&#x27;s just an easy one to conceptualize.<p>Do note that, of your hypothetical scenarios, I&#x27;d posit that the &quot;fancy chair&quot; is probably a medical device (and the entire healthcare system would be paid only in necessity-dollars; <i>all</i> demand there is inelastic.) And the book <i>is</i> probably a nicety. (Why not use a library? Unless it&#x27;s a <i>textbook</i>—those are really, really inelastic, which is why they&#x27;ve gotten to be as expensive as they are.)<p>The flight situation is the truly confounding one. I would agree that this is something that people should be able to do. Yet most flights are for leisure or business, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to distinguish from any sort of government-verifiable context why someone is flying somewhere. There&#x27;s no component of the economy-wide pricing of flights to pick out as being inelastic demand. It&#x27;s a good example.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what to do about it, though. Even if you allocated people regular (nicety-dollar) UBI along with the necessity-dollars I&#x27;ve been talking about, that UBI would still suffer all the same problems plain UBI does. Flights (and anything else you could spend the UBI on) would just get more expensive by exactly how much everyone was getting.<p>---<p>Now, maybe I&#x27;m coming at the problem all wrong. The problem is that <i>suppliers</i> of goods with inelastic demand right now get to charge $(elastic demand + inelastic demand), whereas everyone would be better off if they could only charge $(elastic demand), and then get the $(inelastic demand) paid from some other source.<p>You probably don&#x27;t need a separate currency to do that. You don&#x27;t need UBI, either. You just need, basically, the cheapest house in a market to cost $0, and for all other houses in that market to be shifted down in price by that same adjustment. That <i>could</i> be accomplished with simple government rebates, probably. Find products+services with inelastic demand, write people rebates for the amount of that inelastic demand, done.",1453954218

10986145,comment,10984383,10985427,0,0,erickhill,,,"I had two of mine taken out when I was in the Air Force. I was 21 years old and this was around 1991 or so. I /was/ put under (demoral + valium IV drip). My jaw is rather small (I have always had tight teeth, which makes flossing even a chore now), so they had to chip jaw fragments out of the way for the extractions. There simply was nowhere for new teeth to go.<p>In any case, I remember coming out of anesthesia and the doctor leaning over me, his bloody gloves now removed, and asking me how I was feeling. I was about to respond when, after a moment&#x27;s pause to catch my breath, I suddenly awoke to a very large male nurse giving me chest compressions. The doctor yelled, &quot;He&#x27;s back! He&#x27;s back!&quot; and he made the man stop. I groggily looked about and noticed a female nurse cowering in the corner. She was sobbing uncontrollably and soon ran out of the room (maybe not the best nurse, but I guess she had never &#x27;lost&#x27; someone before). I asked, fuzzy mouthed, what happened?<p>Apparently they pulled my IV out too soon and my forced dehydration and starvation made me faint once the fluids stopped. One of the possible side effects of fainting is a loss of  heart beat. They told me &quot;I had been dead&quot; (which was inaccurate) &quot;for about 90 seconds.&quot; What they meant was my heart had stopped beating for that long.<p>People always ask, so I&#x27;m obliged to say:\nI saw no tunnel of light or flashing of my life before my eyes. It was simply total sleep-like darkness with absolutely no concept of time passing. It was as if I had made a long hard blink, and been told later 90 seconds had elapsed. For all I knew, two seconds had passed, much like a deep solid sleep: It&#x27;s not until you look at the clock that you know how much time has passed.<p>I had the other two wisdom teeth taken out at a dental school in Dallas. That was whole other ordeal. But I didn&#x27;t &quot;die&quot; that time, at least.",1453953713

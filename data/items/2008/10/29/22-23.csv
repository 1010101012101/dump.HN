348138,comment,347334,347402,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"By the end, and even the last few years, the Alpha was no longer as fast as competing processors for the vast majority of workloads.  The x86 architecture had become RISC behind the scenes and Intel and AMD had figured out ways to accelerate CISC to the point where it may have even been a net win for performance (or at least not a significant loss...smaller numbers of instructions had to traverse the slow RAM to CPU bus, and could then be ""decompressed"" into fast executing but more verbose instructions all within the CPU pipeline, where the bus was dramatically faster--raw clock speed had just caught up to the Alpha, but performance was significantly better, and by 2003 when the last ever Alpha clocked at 1.3GHz the Athlon 64 was released with clocks up to 2GHz).  Others, like Sun and IBM and others, had made more progress on the parallelization and shared memory fronts, as well, making Alpha less useful for scientific and other large scale computing work.<p>Finally, the Alpha technology was sold off to Intel.  The advantages of the architecture (and some of the engineers involved) have been assimilated into the CPU borg.  It may be ugly, due to such a long and sordid history, but the x86 architecture is now wicked fast.  Also the Alpha had elephantine power and cooling requirements.  My last company once attended an event where we setup our boxes side by side with a competitors Alpha-based systems, and they had discreetly placed a box fan behind their biggest unit, because, without it, the ambient temperature of the room was too high for the Alpha box to operate reliably.  Their box was much faster than ours though.  I asked if they included a box fan, or if that cost extra.<p>But don't let me stand in the way of nostalgia.  I, too, remember staring in awe at a DEC that was running at 400MHz, when the Intel architectures were still stumbling along at 166, or something along those lines (and with a dramatically slower bus, and only dual CPU capability in the Pentium Pro).",1225320807

There's nothing restricting it from being used in large organizations, though, and it has a bunch of automation (automatic enrollment in Moodle courses based on enrollment status in another database, integrate logins with existing LDAP or other directory, etc.), but like most open source projects it's very much a community product and not the product of a for-profit entity trying to sell service to customers (that's available through third parties, though).",1225320449
348133,comment,347359,348026,0,0,westside1506,,,"The apps that we're running right now control it pretty well using a sneaky trick.  We can't get much computer information from java in an unsigned app, so we measure how long each sub-part of a work unit has taken and sleep an appropriate amount of time.  For example, if we are trying to use 25% and a sub-work takes 100ms, we sleep for 300ms.  This effectively gives us 25% usage of the available CPU.  It will be no higher than that anyway - it might be lower if something else is using substantial CPU time.<p>As far as the fast versus slow nodes, we normalize everything based on the average computer that completes work each day.  So a fast computer may earn 2X or more what a slow computer earns.",1225320436

These customers use 10000s of nodes and buy high-end computers and pay a ton for network, power, cooling, and support personnel.<p>My background is in HPC and I've faced and solved these issues many times. We have a multi-pronged approach to using the compute power:\n1) We are definitely writing our own apps on top of Plura.  It's a great source of compute power and we have lots of ways we want to use it ourselves.\n2) We have a short list of very high impact embarrassingly parallel customers that are evaluating Plura.  We intend to help our customers absorb the porting cost associated with Plura.\n3) We are open to letting students and universities use Plura's excess capacity for free.  We've had several nibbles at this already.<p>That being said, we realize Plura is not for everyone.  It is for a subset of the class of embarrassingly parallel applications out there.",1225320134

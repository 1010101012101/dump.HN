3309988,comment,3285671,3309646,1,0,dpark,,,"1) That's not what I said at all.  For someone who likes to throw the term ""straw man"" at others, you certainly seem to enjoy constructing them.<p>First, I did not say constant.  There's a lot of ground between no oversight (as you paropose) and constant oversight (which you pretend is the only alternative).<p>Second, I was talking about oversight of government wiretaps, not oversight of citizens' lives.  There's a rather significant different between eavesdropping and <i>making sure that no one is eavesdropping</i>.<p>Third, the government <i>does</i> provide oversight for mine and everyone else's actions, and they do it even without wiretaps.  They call it police work.  The police provide oversight so that <i>abuses are not unbounded</i>.  When you say that there should be no oversight for wiretapping until someone complains, the civilian parallel is that police should take no actions except in the face of reported crime.  AKA, no crime prevention.<p>Fifth, no, it's not ironic.<p>2) It's not an either-or situation.  This is like saying that if you run a company, you shouldn't attempt to improve your divisions directly.  Sure, if you've got a consistently-underperforming division, the right thing might be to let it go entirely.  But that doesn't mean that acceptably-performing or even exceptionally-performing divisions cannot perform better.  If a division is wasting money on stupid things, you can and should simply say ""stop doing that"".  Firing everyone is not a net gain most of the time.  (Especially in a world where every division is doing stupid things.  Firing every government agency that wastes money is the same as disbanding the government.)<p>3) Wait, am I to understand that in your fantasy world where the government never abuses private information, they do restrict speech?  The government that never blackmails because it's ""illegal"" will forbid speech, which is apparently not ""illegal""?<p>How do you seriously reconcile these views?  How to you simultaneously believe in a government that will always do the right thing with respect to privacy and also a government that will restrict speech and enforce a totalitarian state?<p>4) If you want to compare email spam mitigation to wiretapping, then maybe you should realize that without spam filtering, <i>false positives do not happen</i>.  Mail is not ""presumed spam"" in the case where no spam filtering takes place.  On the other hand, with spam filtering, false positives are inevitable.  And that's okay, so long as 1) the rate of false positives is sufficiently low, and 2) it's emails going in the spam folder and not <i>humans going to jail</i>.<p>5) You haven't tried looking very hard if the only privacy issues you can find are with Facebook.  More to the point, if you dig in even a little bit, you'll see that many of the privacy concerns with Facebook are based on the fact that after Facebook collects everything possible about your personal life, the <i>government</i> can subpoena that info.<p>And yes, I found many answers, some of which I already listed.  If you land on the no-fly list because of something the government heard you say, that's an important problem.  If a government agent blackmails you because of something they intercepted about you, that's an important problem.  If you can't speak publicly against the government out of fear that they will leak sensitive information about you, that's an important problem.<p>Stop pretending that privacy is not important.  Or at least prove that you believe what you claim by publicly posting your full name, address, date of birth, employer, social security number, mother's maiden name, credit and debit card numbers with expiration dates and security codes, driver's license number, bank account numbers (with routing info, please), online account usernames and passwords, your present and past sexual partners, any diseases you or your immediate family have, and the last 5 years of tax returns.  Absent that, I'm afraid your claim that privacy is not important is rather an obvious sham.",1322978301
3309987,comment,3309697,3309697,6,0,moocow01,,,"Not in reference specifically to product roles, I think one of the problems right now in SV and probably in other tech hubs is the migration of finance, law, ""other fancy profession"" people to the tech industry as the bubble has inflated.  You have lots of people who genuinely have no qualifications specific to the tech business and there only drive is to just follow the path to whatever is shiny and looks like the most possible path to extravagant wealth according to Forbes. Usually they are easy to identify because they transform themselves to fit the mold of whatever is hot.. ex. in 2004 they were real estate agents / brokers, in 2008 they were social media consultants, and now they want to be SV product / tech entrepreneurs because it the latest things in the paper.  The problem with these folks is they unfortunately add little to no value because they spend all their time running around trying to figure out what is the cool thing rather than trying to understand how they can use their own skills to best help others.<p>Honestly Im not too big of a fan of the bubble times.  I'll be glad when things calm down and the finance, law etc types move onto the next shiny thing and were left with the people who truly enjoy the industry.",1322978284

Unfortunately I'm too young to remember the Kodak my grandfather worked for. My grandmother bought 10 shares of Kodak stock for me when I was born as an investment for my college account. With all of that in mind my optimism may be naive.<p>In my opinion, if their patents are not enough to save the company, they at least have kept around many of the right employees to move forward in a digital internet enabled society. They are starting to make a platform for turning digital images into physical prints. Every Target and many CVS stores have Kodak printing kiosks which allow you to print straight from facebook and film. They just released a facebook app for making prints and photobooks. They may not have film and they may not have the its popular digital cameras, but they have the best platform for making prints hands down.",1322978138

Notice how none of these activities are essential to determining whether or not these students can graduate from MIT, but only to guessing at what each student’s potential contribution is to the positive atmosphere at MIT.

Products exist which can penetrate this encryption and log the network traffic directly (when I say ""challenging"" I mean just that, not impossible), translating it into logged IM entries (and yes, they do it by obtaining the keys from the services in question), but they are awfully pricy compared to just declaring that IM shall not be used, and there are enough protocols out there with enough usage that there's some frequent pain around losing logging with protocol updates. You can also host an IM server internally in which case logging is trivial, but many people aren't even aware that this is an option, or don't want to deal with IT to set it up and maintain it, or don't want to purchase the off-the-shelf products which can do it but are <i>also</i> more expensive (virtually by definition) than just declaring it shall not be done.<p>I used to work in this field.

Enthusiasts have been converting small ICE cars (""internal combustion engine"" cars) into electrics for many years.<p>Musk for example converted Lotus. I completely share your opinion that it should be easy and cheap. If i had a large enough garage space, i see how i myself could produce the car under 50K using mostly COTS. On the other side, looking at the real examples - like the Tesla case - it is extremely expensive and complicated.",1322975563

If you mistook my G2 for an iPhone I'd say you need needed your eyes checked. Nevertheless, looking at the list from The Verge, I think there's an argument that it violates all but one of them:<p>- Rectangular with rounded corners (check)<p>- Centered screen with lateral borders (check)<p>- Horizontal speaker slot (check)<p>- Front surface with limited adornment. Well, beyond the elements an iPhone has (speaker slot and trackpad/home button) it has a T-Mobile logo and the 4 lite-up capacative Android buttons. IIRC, this is just like a US Galaxy S2 (the international version, which my wife has, drops the search button). Without the example of the SGS2, I'd say HTC was in the clear here, but...<p>The only ""suggestion"" HTC has clearly followed with the G2 is that between the metal bezel and the gray bumper below it, the front surface isn't entirely black.<p>In other words, the design rights Apple is asserting are astonishingly broad.",1322975120

The problem with any new tax proposed as a replacement for another tax: far too often the new tax gets passed, and repealing the old tax conveniently gets forgotten.  And when the issue comes up, suddenly a pile of programs people supposedly care about couldn't possibly survive without the new revenue.<p>Speaking as someone who has seen a pile of new taxes go by and old ones rarely leave.  Here in Oregon, we finally enacted a pile of protections against the continuous ballot measures demanding new taxes, such as a cap on how much property taxes could go up per year (no more than inflation), as well as a requirement for a 50% turnout in an election to pass a tax (no more special-election surprise taxes).  It also helps that Oregon requires a balanced budget, which means that when the economy goes down, the local governments have to (gasp) <i>spend less</i> (and plead for money, which they usually do) rather than spending more and later demanding money to pay debt.",1316537476

SS and medicare are not collected separately. investment is not taxed. and it's price and cost neutral (that is, the myriad taxes we pay but don't realize: SS, medicare, income, payroll are already hidden in the price of everything we buy and this just makes it transparent).<p>as a libertarian that knows markets fail all the time, i believe the policies should be dynamic and robust. that is, use the reduction of the market to make quick and dirty decisions and heavily regulate those areas that are prone to failure (or just prone to negative externalities while promoting the positive externalities). enough with the waffling centrismcertain things need to be as libertarian as possible while others, particularly dealing with OPM (other people's money) and general welfare of individuals need to be as socialist as possible. and i am fairly confident that that will never happen. alas",1316536220

The number generated from the search engine can be entertaining however when it comes to hiring decisions and real job experience the candidate who is friends with the most influential or worked at a certain company wont exactly turn out to be the most intelligent or at least for a particular position a recruiter is trying to fill (ie, George Bush Jr vs Ronald Reagan).  If I was a recruiter now and I have been in the past for various types of organizations (both in the private and public sector), those who benefit the organization most tend to be those who have the personality, the technical skills, the heart for the job, and share the vision of the team which are all determined by a variety of factors bigger than one single score.  As labor costs constitute such a huge portion of a companys budget, I would suggest getting to know exactly who you hire, inside and out, which takes time and effort.  Well worth it to avoid a disastrous hiring decision.",1316535815

3018157,comment,3014162,3018152,1,0,prole,,,"(continued)<p>>32. Never Get Drunk At Work Parties<p>I'd rephrase this to ""know thyself"". If you know you tend to show your anger/depression/lecherousness when drunk, maybe it wouldn't be such a great idea. Working for companies big and small in the past, I personally enjoyed every opportunity to go out boozing with buddies or bosses. I'd argue that several of the 33 lessons can be checked off at once this way; the idea is comical enough to me (a high-functioning alcohol aficionado), I'm going to spend the rest of the post on it:<p>>1. Youre not smarter than anyone
Nothing like the ancient bonding ritual of drinking until you can't stand straight to bring about the status equilibrium. But it will give you the chance to mention the stuff you have done right that might not have gotten the attention you'd hoped (10. Toot your own horn). ""Well, Bob, writing that script last week was easier than walking right now.""<p>>2. There is such a thing as a stupid question
And several of them will pour out during the bar-crawl. This is good because you have an excuse to talk frankly with one another. This ability to communicate without fear of reprisal is so important, it's a part of the lifestyle of Japanese salarymen. Afterwards, all is forgiven/forgotten because, hey, you were drunk. This means whichever you're going for (16/15. Do/Don't be a yes man), you can feel comfortable in being honest.<p>>3. Looks matter
This pretense falls apart when the top officers of a successful company are joyously murdering their favorite karaoke songs because their brains are too soaked to simultaneously read the words and produce the sounds they represent. It's an ugly reminder of the beautiful truth that, no, your looks and performance are independent variables.<p>>4. Know what you know and what you don't know
And take advantage of this opportunity to ask the important questions. Not banal, ""8. Have a presence"", ""I'm here too, remember?"" small-talk. You can learn the most fucking important information about your work (and thus, life - depending on how you look at it) by splitting a bottle with your boss. This is so important, I'm going to type ""fucking"" again.<p>At my entry-level position at my last job, I knew as much as the top managers - possibly more, if you consider that the other people ""playing it straight"" won't tell the executives what they don't want to hear, but will happily vent their frustrations to you (7. Listen to people, 9. Archive Everything you can, 31. Find out what you like and don't like about your job).<p>Bonus: when people are complaining, they're telling you how to win their hearts (11. Help others and they will help you). When they're drinking and complaining, it's more likely to be truth and not mere politicking.<p>>11. Help others and they will help you
Nothing builds camaraderie like holding your manager's head over the toilet and fetching him some water (or whatever the situation happens to be - searching for the house keys under a desk or the managing director, incidentally, under a desk). Improvise ways out of the adverse situations resulting from the group's drunken antics (30. Do the best you can with what you have).<p>I am mystified by the social ritual of drinking and continue plunging into it in hopes of better understanding it, but the strongest personal - and consequently, professional - bonds are forged in the fires of irresponsibility (24. Learn to work in a team).<p>If anyone has recommended reading on this phenomenon, please do share!<p>>18. Make Friends
>19. Have Fun
>20. Know when to put in the extra hours
>21. Don't get too comfortable
>26. Make your job enjoyable
>27. Take Breaks
>28. Be A Cool Guy<p>All apply directly.<p>I realize a lot of this will sound ludicrous, immature, illogical, terrifying and so on, but anyone who's taken part in school life and business life will have no trouble observing that these adjectives can apply to both. I don't want you to get shitfaced and stumble through the datacenter, tripping on wires and unplugging them before drowning in a puddle of vomit. I do want you to step out of your comfort zone, arrange where you can share more than a few drinks with your boss, learn about your company through his eyes, and better yourself as a result of it.<p>In the context of HN, I would re-title this article: ""33 reasons to start your own company!""

>1. Youre not smarter than anyone<p>Unfortunately, we're ""smarter"" than our users in that we over-estimate their comfort with our service.

Well said, amigo. The advice I've taken from HN on this matter is simply ""fake it 'til you make it"". HOWEVER, being a short phrase, it's prone to misinterpretation. It doesn't mean lie about what you can do. It does mean when I'm negotiating with veteran suits I should try to remain calm and collected, like I have some clue what I'm doing (I don't, but if you can't believe in yourself, how the hell is your client supposed to?).<p>>6.

What is the first function the left or right? Whatever the definition, it may as well be a tautology. If I was explaining composition I would explain it in a way that pulls from prior knowledge but also does not hamstring the learner.<p>In particular composition need not follow any particular direction. What matters in composition is in the ordering of the types, the outputs must fit the inputs. That is you can have f : B <- A and g : C <- B then h = f o g is a function from C <- A that is identical to a function formed by first applying f to its argument and piping that to g. Composition is a way of making  new functions from old ones, kind of like multiplication for functions.<p>* ""Maps - It can hold basic datatypes.""<p>I don't know what that is supposed to mean. But Maps in functional languages tend to be immutable tree based key value data structures.<p>* ""foldRight Is the same as foldLeft except it runs in the opposite direction.""<p>This one is dangerous because it is true in a sense they are dual to each other. But applied indiscrimnately you could end up with different results unless operation with respect to the values is commutative and associative. remember the associative rule from school? Is 5 - (8 - 5) = (5 - 8) - 5? You can think of foldLeft as an accumulating a value and foldright as reducing to a value. foldRight is also less space efficient although you can write it in terms of foldl. However in a lazy language foldr has the additional distinction of being able to work with infinite lists since it works straight from the front of the list, it doesn't have to recurse to the end of the list first like foldl.",1316534610

It is currently running on a VPS with a few other services. We want to see if there is an interest in the app before purchasing better/additional hardware.<p>Use of the app is currently free.

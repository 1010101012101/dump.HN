260307,comment,260017,260104,0,0,rbanffy,,,"""We've got to stop dumping the used ones and zeros into the oceans! It's melting the ice caps!""<p>Really, it's the ones. It's a well known fact ones have more energy than zeros. We should right now start dumping more zeros to cool down the oceans. If we do it quickly enough, we may stop global warming. We should also switch to other binary architectures as x86 code has a one-to-zero ratio that exceeds 1.",1217328135

260300,comment,260017,260017,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I love contrarian articles.<p>Not only is it fun reading a scathing criticism, (and I think he went too far in some ways and not far enough in others) the really funny part is watching the target audience digest (or rather, regurgitate) it.<p>There is a strange similarity between YC and a cult. You guys quote PG all the time like he's the next Buddha or something. YC is looked at as the only way towards making your startup happen. Sometimes around application time the posts get really out there as far as hero worship -- and Paul's said so himself.<p>Having said that, there's a LOT of dissension here as well. Lots of folks that have nothing to do with YC and just think Paul's a nice, regular schmuck like the rest of us. I know I'm here because of the crowd -- and by that I mean the larger startup crowd, not necessarily the YC bunch. This is the first board I've been on that has a long-running discussion about how single-arrow voting sucks, for one thing, or the role of contrarian comments in a healthy community.<p>So yeah, he's got a bit of a point. But it's mostly overblown, and I wouldn't worry about it. If you're 22 years old and don't have somebody to look up to? Then I'd start worrying.",1217327155

260296,comment,260017,260116,0,0,mtts,,,"It's responses like these that at the very least do very little to disprove the author's point.<p>Of course YC is not a cult and PG is not a cult leader, but some people here do seem to treat them as such. Some of the questions asked here (like the ""Is 40 years too old to start a startup"" one alluded to in the original article) and some of the material posted here (like the ramblings of the poor college kid who thought being glued to a computer for 80 hours a week was a fulfilling existence) indicate that PG's message ""running a startup is one of the most rewarding things you can do in your life"" gets distorted in some people's minds to ""running a startup is the only thing in your life that's worthwhile to do"".<p>The irony, of course, is that PG himself, in his writings, demonstrates an interest in a lot of other things besides web start ups. It's not only PG who seems to have an unusually broad world view, however. The same holds true for a large number of the people who post here.<p>Unfortunately, a small number of people such as yourself seem to overlook that and reduce the message (if there is such a thing, which I doubt) to something ridiculous. The author definitely has a point there.",1217326475
260295,comment,259893,259893,0,0,jlouis,,,"I agree with this guy on the 'int' type. My OCaml code has often produced the wrong result because of it rather than merely run slowly.<p>I also agree with the type zoo. While it is rather cool to have simple types to appease Hindley-Milner inference, nobody makes it impossible for you to add extra types. In that respect types becomes a way to give a <i>representation</i> of what is in a variable. A 8x8 boolean matrix has a pretty interesting representation in 64 bit for instance which you want if speed matters.<p>But I would still choose Ocaml over Common Lisp or Scheme for any kind of problem where single-cpu performance matters.",1217326400

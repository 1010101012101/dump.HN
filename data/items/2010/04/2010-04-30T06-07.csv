Ultimately, it will be very hard for anything running on x86 to compete with ARM at the moment in power/watt, which is probably the most important metric for these sorts of devices. Inte's working hard to change that, but they haven't managed it yet.<p>Furthermore, the constant cries for a Windows 7 slate are misguided. There are very few benefits to having windows any many disadvantages. While it's true Window's software will run on such a device, actually using it is a different matter. Just trying to scroll on the tiny scroll bar or tap a target a few pixels wide would be impossible with a capacitive screen and your finger, rendering most desktop applications useless.<p>If HP is refocusing on a WebOS-based ARM device, they have an actual chance at matching the iPad's usability and specs.

The key point is this:<p><i>[The scientific literature on psychiatric drugs] is remarkably consistent in the story it tells. Although psychiatric medications may be effective over the short term, they increase the likelihood that a person will become chronically ill over the long term.</i><p>Most people nowadays think that psychiatry finally established itself on a scientific footing with the biochemical model of mental illness and associated drug treatments. If this guy's right, then the biochemical model and associated drugs are just the latest chapter in a long history of pseudo-scientific barbarism, this time founded on a massive conflict of interest.<p>This part is positively Orwellian:<p><i>At some later point, however, as the chemical imbalance story repeatedly fell apart, psychiatrists in the research community understood that they were telling a “fib.” I can still remember -- this was the summer of 1998 -- when I questioned a prominent academic psychiatrist about whether the chemical imbalance story was really “true” and he replied by stating that it was a “useful metaphor” that “helped patients understand why they needed to take their medication.”</i>",1272609666

1307425,comment,1305346,1305731,0,0,demallien,,,"You're talking about the adoption of Cocoa and the fact that iTunes still uses Carbon?  It's not really a fair accusation.  I think Apple would very much like to be able to rewrite iTunes in Cocoa, but they have a problem - it's a cross-platform application.  As a result they have chosen to use an API on the Mac that most closely resembles an API available on Windows.  They know that iTunes is not exploiting the features available on both platforms to their fullest - perhaps painfully so.  It is precisely this type of experience which makes them wish to avoid cross-platform development on their new platform.<p>I mean Apple really does care about the user experience, more so than any other company that I can think of.  And yet even they have not managed to put together a good user experience for their cross-platform app.  On the Mac it isn't hooked up to all of the Cocoa hotness, and on the PC, well, the less said, the better.<p>It is Apple's firsthand experience with the problems you can have during cross-platform development that is informing their decision to strongly discourage such development on the iPhone platform.",1272609385

Apple's argument is really poor and arguing against it would be difficult for this reason, any thorough response would probably look defamatory. Its a lot easier to just treat it with the contempt it deserves.<p>For example, it contains intrinsically weak arguments. e.g. the section headed ""Fifth, there's Touch"" is equally applicable to HTML5 and infact most of the rest of the internet technologies. If you can fix ""Touch"" well enough for HTML5 then you must be able to fix it well enough for Flash, the requirements are identical.<p>The h.264/battery life argument is similarly weak in that it can be turned against almost any video codec, suggesting that h.264 is some kind of silver bullet ""optimal"" solution, which it most certainly is not. It also closes the doors to open solutions and user choices of codec - what if I want to host video myself and don't want to waste resources and money on h.264?<p>The layers argument is good, but unfortunately in this context it is extremely weak - Apple love adding their own layers. Look how many layers there are in OS X... should Cocoa be ditched just because its an extra layer? It provides similar functionality to Flash of ""making something hard, easier"".<p>The open argument is pretty irrelevant to whether Flash is useful or not, but I actually like it... my traditional reason for disliking Adobe has been PDF and Flash and the way they have degraded the internet, although that has as much to do with bad use as it does with being proprietary formats.<p>The remaining arguments are the ""full web"" and ""security"" arguments, both of which are valid although I am distracted midway through the ""full web"" argument by this blatant lie - ""There are more games and entertainment titles available for iPhone, iPod and iPad than for any other platform in the world."". Maybe he means you can buy more titles - that would be almost believable...<p>The security argument is great but I'd be careful of making too much of it - iPhone is secure by obscurity and I suspect Flash is such a ""security problem"" because it is so heavily used. You can compare Safari and IE in the same way, IE is much, much, <i>MUCH</i>, more secure - but to a pretty good approximation, nobody uses Safari - still IE gets a worse image for security because so many people are using it that its 1) a worthwhile target 2) got a large enough user base that complaints come in significant volumes.<p>Did any of that sound remotely good?",1272607350

I'd gladly pay as much as for an iPad for a device that gives me (a) the basic functionality you'd use on an iPad (web browsing, calendar, pdf viewer) but also (b) enables you to use any kind of application, including your own, without paying extra for a ""developer account"" or requiring to jailbreak the thing.<p>That said, yes they have a prototype, but are they any closer to market than the WePad (also Android)?",1272607259

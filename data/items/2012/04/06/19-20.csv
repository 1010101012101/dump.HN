On one path, it's null, on the other, it's a typed value. Can you optimize that?<p>2) Cool! phc went the route of really advanced, context sensitive analysis, and the result was massive memory use and huge compile times for even simple programs (if using optimization).<p>3) Have you read IBM's POPL 2010 paper on it? Interesting stuff, though maybe not actionable. They argue (there's that word again!) that PHP's copy-on-write is flawed for arrays containing references - the reference can lose it's reference-ness when the array gets altered and copied. They have an implementation which fixes this for a relatively small slowdown. Interesting paper as I recall.<p>FWIW, I think it's allowable to change the output of var_dump.

There are places like bofa where I've pushed into production a cvar processing module on 500,000 loans which uses only actors. No low level tinkering with util.concurrent, no Threadpool setting, no Executors, no synchronized anywhere in my code. In the past at GS, I wrote concurrent code where I explicitly specified the number of threads & we had a ThreadPool manager & internally it used the util.concurrent classes. At LinkedIn, I believe they started with actors & switched parts of it to Doug Lea's framework ( which was the sort of the foundation of util.concurrent). I have seen financial shops where they do half & half - the quants seem to like actors but the swing programmers like to have control on threadcounts, & they tend to do things like naming threads & creating parent-child relationships so swing can paint reliably & they can debug threads by name when it doesn't. I did the same in the past when most of my work was on the swing side, creating custom blotters to show trade tickets & the like. But now I primarily do quant model building work with actors & no more util.concurrent stuff. If you want to construct a lattice model to price structured options on a 100 different strikes per month for 5 years in advance, you can find no better friend than an actor. Actors are certainly not a thought experiment, very much a reality.",1333739897

While MongoDB doesn't have SQL transactions, it does have atomic operations similar to relational databases.<p>Normalization is an interesting term that really has been defined or redefined to fit into a relational mindset. Denormalized often implies unstructured mess, while that could be the case in any database (relational included). It is certainly not the norm for MongoDB.<p>In MongoDB a properly designed schema is very structured and 'normalized'. In truth these schemas don't mirror relation schemas, they could, but it would ignore beneficial additions the document model provides.  It is very easy to use the same ERD diagram for both relational and MongoDB. What you will find in both is very structured accessible data. In MongoDB you will find that the ability to have a given fields value be an array or object permits your schema to more accurate map to your actual use of the data. The schema will be simpler as you no longer need things like many to many join tables.<p>Not to say that MongoDB is better than relational, just different.

If I am operating a service that someone files a complaint against, especially if I am a startup, I have very little recourse before my business is trashed. This is independent of whether or not I am guilty of anything, or my users have submitted infringing content to my service. Content owners and federal agencies have a historical lack of concern about the accuracy of their claims, so I would like to ensure that they have to be rigorous before they can take down my service. They should have to prove to a judge that I am in fact in violation of the law before they can cut off my source of income.<p>Speaking to the philosophical issue that pg raised, I believe people have a right to attempt to make money from their efforts. I also believe that they most definitely do not have a right to be successful in that attempt, regardless of how much effort they have put in. They also do not have a right to continued success if the world around them changes. What works on Monday may not work on Friday, and the fact that it worked Monday should not serve as a guarantee that Friday's endeavor has a right to success. If the effort it takes to secure a number of the size required to represent a 3 minute song becomes a burden on society, then I do not think they have a right to be successful in doing so. The same goes for the software I produce. If my securing it from copying that I do not approve of becomes a burden on society, then I do not have a right to be successful in securing it. Personally, I interpret a circumvention of due process and an attitude of ""guilty until a successful appeal is filed"" as a burden on society.",1333739089

You  could make your components do anything you want, while keeping everything that was good about the superclass.<p>It isn't baffling that ""open web"" technologies lack this kind of programmer-facing openness. That's a result of the browser wars, the underlying implementation, the original design concerns, the limitations of the early internet, and umpteen other factors both human and technological.<p>But our systems _should_ become open and layered, or else Javascript polyfills and libraries will be the new platform, and HTML and CSS will simply be the uneven ground upon which that level platform was built.

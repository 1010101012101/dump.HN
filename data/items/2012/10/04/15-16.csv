(If they change their domain or URL structure, they won't lose subscribers because they can just adjust the source feed in the feed service without affecting the public feed URL.)<p>MailChimp, Aweber, and the rest have replaced FeedBurner for email subscriptions for many because they offer more control over the HTML template, help build lists for other marketing efforts, and are generally better set up to guarantee delivery of email and report on opens and clickthrough rates.<p>That leaves feed count, traffic distribution, and portable feed addresses (plus whatever else you can come up with).

But it then explains that there's plenty of prior art and no basis for Litepanels' claiming patent rights over the manufacture and sale of LED products.<p>Only one of the above claims can be true.<p>Also there are some very big players in the LED field, with potentially billions of dollars at stake. This isn't exactly the scenario in which a grass-roots action committee is either the appropriate response, or likely to make any difference.<p>Also, the essay needs some fact checking:<p>> Furthermore patents are legally only given to those that create something new that someone skilled in the art would not think of.<p>Although once true, at present this is false -- very, highly, extremely false.

An eventual archive will include stories of successful business building, lessons from failed ventures, and the step-by-step processes involved in idea validation, product development and revenue generation.<p>A specific goal of Hurdles will be to supplement stories of startup building with actionable toolsets and data that can be leveraged in the actual business-building process by new founders. Examples include open-source worksheets and flowcharts that budding entrepreneurs will be able to use to perform an analysis on their own value propositions. Teachings of startup gurus such as Steve Blank and Paul Graham will be referenced along with actual anecdotal tales of successful and failed ventures and the strategies that facilitate them.<p>Finally, there will be a healthy dose of edginess injected into our discussion, designed to enlighten and make more personable the sometimes dense and daunting path that an entrepreneur must face in the early stages of business building. Coupled with actionable and proven entrepreneurship tools and advice, Startup Hurdles will become a known force in the startup blog community and will have a sizable impact on new business building in this next phase of the technology startup boom.<p>- Team @ Startup Hurdles",1349366156

I own recruiting for an 7+ y/o company (that I cofounded) that is significantly larger than the median YC company; I'm also one of 4 key sales team members. I've had those roles since the company started; I also recruited our President. There's no correlation I can observe between athleticism and sales/recruiting success.<p>I've also spent years of my life doing enterprise sales (as a product manager riding along with account managers to F-500 accounts). I may in this capacity have accumulated more direct sales experience than you have. Let me set you straight on something right away: a demonstrable ability for eating steak while receiving a lap dance is far more predictive of sales ability than one's ability to do a pull-up. The salespeople who could finish a marathon did not as a rule outperform the salespeople who would have felt at home eating onion cheeseburgers at 9AM on the mortgage desk at Salomon in 1987.<p>There is a clear and obvious correlation between selling ability and confidence. Every successful salesperson (or recruiting or, probably, fundraiser) I've known could walk into a room, look you in the eye, and confidently ask for the sale. Confident people can take command of a room; they sieze the channel and shut off the normal conversational flow control signals that sales targets rely on to blow people off. They do it without trying and often without the target even noticing it. It's about confidence and, to an extent, about shamelessness and an ability to deal with rejection.<p>Culturally --- perhaps for good reasons given the health issues involved --- people with appearance handicaps are conditioned to be deferential instead of confident, and to fear rejection, probably because they face it in life situations where other people never even have to think about rejection. But apart from body odor and wildly inappropriate dress, physical appearance isn't so much a direct obstacle as it is a handicap to developing confidence.<p>So I recommend that the reader ignore the comment I'm replying to. ""Hitting the gym"" is, empirically, not going to get you (a) thinner any time soon (though it will make you healthier and, if you're me, drastically reduce your blood pressure) or (b) funded.

There are terms frequently used in such contracts that look like normal English (or other language) words but may have very well-defined and specific legal meaning.  Examples would include ""work"", ""inventions"", ""work for hire"", etc.  Generally you can find definitions of these online, including in Wikipedia, and also sometimes in the contract itself.<p>The contracts also often have a place for ""excepted works / inventions"" where you can write things that you would want to exclude from the contract.  Be careful again of the precise contract though as:<p>1.  The exceptions are generally intended for work you did ""prior"" to employment by the company.  Anything you do after joining may not be covered in this form.<p>2.  As John noted, you may still have a requirement to disclose any excepted work you do within prescribed time limits to the employer.<p>3.  You may have non-compete clauses which prevent you from working on things related to the employers line (or anticipated line) of business.  This bears another example where people often misinterpret -- They claim for example that their side project is on end-consumer software application while the company products are enterprise related [Hint:  Do not go by your or normal language definition of ""related"".  As far as legal world is concerned, ""software"" may be just one category.  A good check, though probably not correct, would be to see which line of businesses the employer's trademarks are registered for.]<p>To summarize:<p>1.  As John said, better to discuss with a lawyer.<p>2.  Even with '1' above, go read a book or two.  E.g.: ""www.amazon.com/Intellectual-Property-Open-Source-Protecting/dp/0596517963/""<p>3.  Do not blindly fill the excepted works/inventions form.  It by itself may not save you.  You may need a separate agreement in writing stating something like ""Employer has no interest in your side project and does not mind you working on it on the sides"".  Make sure also that your side project is well defined in this new contract -- My guess is that over including or under including would not be good ideas.<p>4.  There have been previous discussions on HN.  I would have found some for you but need to rush right now.<p>Disclosure:  IANAL.",1349365704

Hell, big chunks of the git chrome (things like ""git am"", ""git request-pull"", ""git send-email"") is <i>precisely</i> an attempt to write scripts to automate core parts of the kernel workflow.  Github added bits of its own, like ""watching"" a public repository and providing a core spot for pull requests to land, with discussion and review tools.  I don't understand why you're so interested in ""enforcement"" when projects using these tools seem to be doing just fine.<p>What you're saying sounds to me a lot like the stuff we heard from Java nerds in the 90's (who certainly didn't invent it, Pascal and PL/1 nuts said much of the same stuff) -- the programming environment should be designed to force the user into a particular style.  Our community has, for the most part, rejected that view in favor of dynamic systems with more flexibility.  Why should SCM branch management be any different?",1349364908

That is, rebase <i>removes</i> the messy branch history. But I'd prefer to keep that history, but rarely use or display it. bisect can also ignore those branches and only use the merge points.

So what's the problem?<p>Assuming you're looking beyond the simple answer (because they 're not selling a product/service the majority of their user-base will purchase), I'd say they suffer from the lack of agility. Facebook's size increases their effort to implement  even the simplest of changes. We've seen how fickle those users are about little changes and future ones could affect the group in negative and unintended ways. I'm sure every change is examined to death before implementation. In contrast, a start-up making changes might lose their early adopters, but could gain orders of magnitude more users because of that change. Facebook, however, already has the user-base. Facebook needs to keep them happy and drastically changing things in the name of profit would probably send people running. Of course not everyone will run and profit might increase, but those changes would have to be time consuming just from an implementation standpoint given their size and now being publicly traded the desire to keep the investors happy.",1349363942

""Follow the money"" is standard fraud investigation practice, and a defrauded consumer's CC will do just fine. Tracing the transactions back to the processor and merchant account is doable, but it's often a temporary solution. How do you stop them from simply opening another?<p>When someone establishes a merchant account, they often do so as a corporation. Corporation blacklisted? Start another one. The requirements for opening a merchant account are similar to a standard credit check. If you have no credit history, your terms will be worse, and the bank will probably hold funds for a longer period of time than if you had good credit, but ultimately, that's just a cost of doing business. If there's inbound cash flow to be had, the exercise of managing costs is standard business practice.<p>To stop them, you have to find the people behind the operation and put them in jail.

A workflow that suits a simple desktop application is different from what is used by a kernel or another product that has dozens of targets to worry about. Similarly a web app that gets deployed in a controlled environment will most likely need a different way of working than an end-user application that goes into an app store to be downloaded and ran on a variety of devices.<p>> Our own teams have a set of practices which are similar but different from what Linus outlines here. And different projects on my company use different practices from those.<p>The culture around your product is probably very different from the kernel devs' culture so it makes sense for you to have a different model.<p>> The worst thing is that there's no way of enforcing these workflows or practices other than out-of-band social conventions. And so minor mistakes happen, all the time. Our Git projects are never as pretty as they should be.<p>Enforcing certain kinds of work flow would mean not allowing something that is currently possible. Crippling one workflow to standardize on another, while there is no clear evidence that one workflow would be the best for everyone.<p>Everyone has their own ideas on what is a clean history, whether it's a linear or has --no-ff merges for every feature. The most important thing is that it is useful. To me and my team that means that every commit on master should build on every target we have (dozens!) so ""git bisect"" won't be painful.",1349362822

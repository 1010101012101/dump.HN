And it would be very easy to set such a thing up. And there's an entire industry with a lot of old money invested in that industry continuing. That means motive. Nobody here can say yet with 100% confidence what really did or did not happen. Could it have really happened in a non-setup fashion? Of course, and arguably it is/was inevitable. Could it also have been a ""hit job""? You bet. Whenever you've got people in one camp with millions if not billions in existing revenue on the line, you have a motive. And the means and method are both easy and obvious.",1312091766

2827677,comment,2827533,2827533,20,0,sriramk,,,"Bill actually mentioned this in in another interview (can't find that now, I think it was around the time of his retirement from MSFT - it could have been at an internal event).<p>He basically said something like - I don't know why people think that the email is something weird or unique. This is my job and I do it all the time.<p>My personal take - I actually blame Bill for this. The real cause of the situation is how things had been allowed to drift to this stage over several years and Windows versions. I'd put the responsibility on Bill, as CSA and ex-CEO, to have stopped this, rather than send flame mail one late night. Also, if you see the follow-up email threads, none of the VPs or GMs were empowered to make end to end changes either",1312089273

""I bought a/an Android"" totals over 150k google results, but ""I returned my Android"" gets under 8k.<p>This is * extremely* rough (as google's count for results can be utter BS), but it looks more like 5% than 40%. Not good, but nothing like 40%.",1312089222

The listing service botched their PR badly and only got around to doing the right thing after some missteps. This was all pretty inevitable and unfortunate.<p>How is this not <i>the</i> story of every corporate disaster? How are we switching from ""a firm is a way to turn very smart people into a very dumb organization"" to ""these people are soulless""?",1312089159

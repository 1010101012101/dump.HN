4001,comment,3820,3836,0,0,volida,,,"I think the reason everyone is applying to YC is because of networking and connections which is really valuable. Now, if there were 1000 companies being funded by YC it means there would be so many people with access to these connections. Which means the value of YC's network would drop. A lot of people then wouldn't feel really erged to apply while this competition the are feeling among them when applying, would be lost, if anyone with iq higher than 130 was getting funded...<p>*update:<p>more people getting funded = (lim markets - shrinks/saturation) =&gt probability people fail &gt probability people succeed =&gt bubble breaks <p>this will be the feelings and hopes bubble, and not investments bubble, because obviously whereas with the same money (e.g. 1 million USD) invested during 1999 only 1 company could appear, using YC's approach with the same money, more startups are given birth. <p>Thus this is the bubble also but not in investors return (because the rate of propability increases using YC's approach) but in founders feelings...

4000,comment,3820,3836,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"Here's a great way to grow:<p>\nHow about inserting a clause in your funding agreement?  Any company that you fund should provide a small percentage of profits + time to help new founders.   <p>This small percentage of profits would be given to YC, on condition that YC would use it exclusively to fund new companies. Of course, 'profit' implies that YC would be able to fund 1000 startups a year only if its existing investments are successful.  Essentially, YC would earn the opportunity to increase the # of companies it funds based on the success of its previous investments. <p>And as for the founders time, it seems you already have that covered.  <p>The most limited resource seems to be your time.  I don't think there's an easy answer to that one.  You may need to expand your partnership....<p>The question for me is:  are there even 1000 companies worth funding every year?  That would be cool to see.  Perhaps some of the profits could be directed towards developing the base of potential entrepreneurs.\n",1173822195

3995,comment,3865,3865,0,0,dfranke,,,"I've stopped buying books on specific tools / programming languages.  I can almost always find better information online.  (Ruby is one exception: you pretty much need the pick-axe book).  safari.oreilly.com is a great resource when nothing else is available.  However, I still regularly purchase books on ""higher"" topics like algorithms or mathematical abstractions, the sort of books that I'm more likely to find in my university's bookstore than at Barnes & Noble.",1173821142

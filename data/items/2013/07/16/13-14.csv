The control panel talked over RS-485 to a motor control board that sat somewhere else in the machine.<p>So I took the original code, recompiled it to arm-eabi, and stuck it into an NDK library on Android 4.04.  So now I have an Android UI in the foreground talking over JNI to the orignal (unmodified) control panel code in the background.  All I needed to do was switch the serial driver code a bit to handle the iMX&#x27;s UART setup and pthread up the old UI event loop to let it run free underneath Android.<p>The board I&#x27;m using is a custom-designed PCB with an iMX6 Solo (single A9 core), but we used the SABRE-SD reference design from Freescale as our starting point.  For proof of concept I used a Boundary SabreLite (now called BD-SL-i.MX6) for $199.  That comes with two RS232 ports with DB-9 breakout connectors.<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a cheaper design than this Utilite, although they really don&#x27;t have full pricing online yet.  I&#x27;m guessing the $99 is for the Solo or even SoloLite and the multiple core units will be significantly more than this.<p>They also don&#x27;t say how much RAM is on the $99 unit. &quot;Up to 4GB&quot; says nothing about the specs on the cheapest one.  I&#x27;ve found I need at least 256MB to run the FSL AOSP build in a minimal form.<p>You seem concerned about GPS as well, this Android build from Freescale contains a driver for the Atheros Orion GPS chipset over UART.

To make very sure that what he wrote is read, he puts in fancy caps and some light swearing, which, however, is not directed at anyone in particular. A more polite version of this would have been No., but I dont see any bullying/abuse.<p>> It&#x27;s a bug alright - in the kernel. How long have you been a maintainer? And you <i>still</i> haven&#x27;t learnt the first rule of kernel maintenance?<p>It appears that this guy violated some rather important rule of kernel development which he should have known given his experience. Again, no name-calling or directed swearing whatsoever, however. Again, a more polite version could be We dont break userspace, and you know that., which doesnt look particularly different to me.<p>> If a change results in user programs breaking, it&#x27;s a bug in the kernel. We never EVER blame the user programs. How hard can this be to understand?<p>I would wager the guess that similar problems pop up from time to time and Linus is getting tired of seeing them all the time, hence his question. Again, no name-calling at all, also no abuse, but a (justified, though maybe slightly aggressive) question.<p>> [technical details]<p>> Shut up, Mauro. And I don&#x27;t _ever_ want to hear that kind of obvious garbage and idiocy from a kernel maintainer again. Seriously.<p>Again, no name-calling of the maintainer, but only an assessment of what he wrote, which, to Linus, appears very wrong.

Is this the line with which you had a problem?<p>Linus then goes on to explain again why this particular idea was TOTAL CRAP, with some more colourful adjectives regarding the patch. Again, no abuse.<p>> The fact that you then try to make <i>excuses</i> for breaking user space, and blaming some external program that <i>used</i> to work, is just shameful. It&#x27;s not how we work.<p>This could be interpreted as somewhat personal, though it likely only means I expected better and am disappointed in you.<p>> Fix your f*cking &quot;compliance tool&quot;, because it is obviously broken. And fix your approach to kernel programming.<p>Note that the fucking is for the compliance tool, which apparently is broken; the comment regarding kernel programming is again directed at their competence rather than person, so I dont see any particular abuse there, either.<p>The remaining question is then, why didnt Linus just write something along the lines of No. / Dont break userspace. / No. / No.? Likely because then someone would have called him out on not going into details or because they got the same email regarding three small mistakes and a question and now dont know whether this issue is a similar small mistake or something more problematic.",1373981693

One of the most beautiful places in the country.<p>The art and music scene here will <i>not</i> compare to a New York or a San Francisco, but compared to other half a million person small cities Asheville punches <i>waaaay</i> over its weight class. Its art and music scene is better than many medium sized (2-4 million) cities. There are lots of festivals too, like this: <a href=""http://mountainoasisfestival.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mountainoasisfestival.com</a><p>The food here is incredible. It&#x27;s easily as good or better than the food you will find in Boston and New York. It is difficult to find a bad restaurant downtown.<p>There is, of course, tons of beautiful outdoors stuff to do: hiking, biking, kayaking, backpacking, mountain climbing, just about anything except skiing (it&#x27;s the South, no snow). There&#x27;s lakes not far away too, including some that permit power boating. So there is <i>that</i> kind of skiing.<p>Weather is nice. It can get a little cold/snowy in the winter. Hard winters are not unknown but are rare. Last winter was very mild. Summers are warm but since it&#x27;s up in the mountains you do not get the soul crushing Southern heat you get in, say, Atlanta or Orlando.<p>If you are a single heterosexual man... well... you will probably like it. I&#x27;m not so it doesn&#x27;t matter to me, but if I were I would not have been disappointed.<p>If you&#x27;re gay, I know there&#x27;s a decent gay scene. I&#x27;m not so I can&#x27;t talk about that from first hand experience. It&#x27;s also generally a pretty tolerant place.<p>Finally, downtown is alive. Unlike most interior cities, Asheville revolves around its center. There are lots of people walking around and lots of people (including me) live right in the middle of the city.<p>- The bad:<p>It&#x27;s a small town. It can feel small after a while.<p>The tech scene is so-so. There are a few decent startups and a few major employers, but keep in mind this is a small city. If you&#x27;re looking for a hot tech scene you&#x27;ll be disappointed. Personally I kinda wanted a break from that, so I didn&#x27;t care. I found a good job and picked up some very interesting freelance work. If I turn down the Silicon Valley offer I may go more in a freelance direction, and try to bootstrap my own startup project too.<p>Asheville is an island amid the pentecostal / fundamentalist Christian back country of Appalachia. Drive for 30 minutes in any direction and you are in the <i>hiiieeeeells</i>.<p>The job market frankly sucks for most people. If you&#x27;re in tech -- and <i>especially</i> if you can freelance/telecommute -- you can escape it to some extent. But the joke is that Asheville has the &quot;best educated wait staff in the country.&quot; It&#x27;s not really a joke. Underemployment is a huge problem.<p>And real estate here including rent is not cheap when you compare it to the median income. It looks cheap compared to Silicon Valley, but SV also has a lot of high salaries that you&#x27;d find it hard to earn here (unless you can telework / freelance / startup). The RE market is distorted because Asheville is a major vacation and retirement destination.<p>You have to advance your own dreams or career goals.

Nor is it that elements such as the floppy disk are twenty years obsolescent.<p>The problem with the pictographic language rooted in skeuomorphism is that it lacks a grammar. It has no rules of combination. There is no icon for copy and paste - let alone one for copy from <i>context a</i> and paste in <i>context b.</i><p>It is not entirely an accident that alphabets have been replacing pictograms for three millennia.

Industrial interfaces are increasingly a screen and a keyboard [a keyboard is our industrial interface to an alphabet].<p>What is the most useful feature of the iOS interface?

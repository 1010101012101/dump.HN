Too much effort goes in mainstream economics, while complex systems and agent based models are where the good stuff is, to answer question such as yours.<p>Aggregation problems are at the very core of Hayek reflection. I would not say it&#x27;s bad. Look at his excellent 1945 paper: <a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html</a><p>There seems to be a lot going in favor. The global optimality depends on what one think is best.<p>Like, maybe Betamax was really better than VHS, but we humans settle on VHS. They went away with DVD. Then, rinse  and repeat with Blueray.<p>Maybe Betamax and HD-DVD were much better, and maybe in an alternate reality they won. But saying they should have won and imposing that by force would be unfair to all those who chose otherwise in this reality.<p>And if we argue on a coordination problem, I would disagree- all it takes is something much better, like DVDs were to the VHS, or as streaming is to Blueray.<p>So being &quot;stuck&quot; on a local optima depends on a) the existence of an alternative only slightly better and b) lack of progress, ie never ever having a clearly better alternative to overcome the smallness of the difference or c) disregarding the opinions or the costs to whoever prefers the alternative.<p>We may not have proofs, but there is a strong argument. But maybe I am biased, as I would consider myself an Austrian economist.<p>Personally, I think the best way is leaving everyone free, not forcing anyone to do what they don&#x27;t want to do, as I don&#x27;t like the concept of force or violence. I don&#x27;t care about government action as such - if it was optional, as in a &quot;recommendation&quot;. As in saying cigarettes are bad. Not in banning or taxing them.",1445893047

10454397,comment,10453336,10453336,0,0,_delirium,,,"A complexity here is that Switzerland is a small country heavily integrated with the Eurozone, but with its own currency that has recently risen strongly in value. In CHF terms, yes, Swiss prices are currently deflating. But this isn&#x27;t really a domestic deflation phenomenon in the sense that a similar decline in prices would be in a bigger economy like the USA: the role of CHF in Switzerland isn&#x27;t nearly as canonical/exclusive as the role of USD in the USA, since so much Swiss business, even individual business, takes place in EUR-priced marketplaces.<p>As the article briefly mentions, the Swiss Franc is now worth about 10% more vis-a-vis the Euro than it was a year ago. Many things in Switzerland are actually inflating if you care about EUR value, which many Swiss people and businesses do: prices and wages have decreased 2% in nominal CHF values, <i>while the CHF has simultaneously appreciated 10%</i>. Many Swiss employees therefore in practice have a salary that represents more European buying power than it did a year ago. That could be expected to have some effects more similar to inflation rather than deflation, in this context.<p>I think the same would probably happen with any small European country. If Denmark broke the DKK/EUR peg and let the DKK appreciate by ~10%, many things would deflate in DKK terms to compensate.",1445892756

Positions aren&#x27;t assigned on the basis of that percentage; rather, it just works out that they&#x27;d match it overall across an industry. Or it would, and that was my point. Differences in individual workplace makeup are deviations away from that, for whatever reasons you have (say, the gender split amongst CS graduates and other factors that contribute to it and the numbers we see today).<p>> Yes, they are.<p>That was a rather poor word choice on my part. That sentence consisted of a series of historical examples of rationals used when describing women as lesser beings for various reasons. When I wrote &quot;different,&quot; I was thinking specifically of arguments used against women&#x27;s suffrage movements on the basis of irrationality. Even more obvious arguments can be found in how common diagnoses of &quot;female hysteria&quot; by the European medical community for centuries. Even the word hysteria comes from the Greek hystera, meaning womb. The precursor of those arguments--the so-called wandering womb--dates back to at least Hippocrates. Plato later describes the theory in the Timaeus, and Aretaeus after him. The medical community never really managed to escape the theory until relatively recently. It&#x27;s actually a really fascinating history; if you&#x27;re interested, Hysteria: The disturbing history by Andrew Scull is an excellent introduction to how the disease of hysteria changed over time, eventually fading altogether as we learned more about the human mind.<p>I guess my point is that there&#x27;s a huge difference between historical views of the female mind (and its differences) compared to how neuroscientists approach the question today. You&#x27;re absolutely right in that sense; chemical and structural differences might affect how information and sense input is processed, but the current body of research doesn&#x27;t recognize that as indicating a difference in ability or even capability. Chalk this up to a poorly written sentence on my part with my apologies.<p>> If you believe the American Association of University women, they &quot;wage gap&quot; is about 6%. Not 77% like it&#x27;s widely (and falsely) reported.<p>One of the reasons why I said to set questions of wage aside is precisely for this reason. The 77% number comes from BLS statistics, but those numbers are in aggregate and making comparisons from that is intellectually dishonest at best. But it&#x27;s a very easy mistake to make, precisely because the caveats behind that number are so complex.<p>There are a lot of very significant factors that have to be accounted for, and the top-line numbers <i>can&#x27;t</i> do that by their very nature. Career choice is one of the largest: what cultural factors push women towards one career and men towards another--and how early do those factors start influencing people&#x27;s own choices and self-images? Just look at the nursing field and how it&#x27;s shifting from its historical, almost all-female makeup. While I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s relevant to the discussion, Blau and Kahn expand on the points raised by the AAUW article if you&#x27;re interested:<p><a href=""http://web.stanford.edu/group/scspi/_media/pdf/key_issues/gender_research.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.stanford.edu/group/scspi/_media/pdf/key_issues/ge...</a>",1445891296

Also, if you can convert each sentence in a document into a vector, you can then take that sequence of vectors and try and model why you get this vector after you get these vectors, that&#x27;s called reasoning, that&#x27;s natural reasoning, and that was kind of the core of good old fashioned AI and something they could never do because natural reasoning is a complicated business, and logic isn&#x27;t a very good model of it, here we can say, well, look, if we can read every English document on the web, and turn each sentence into a thought vector, we&#x27;ve got plenty of data for training a system that can reason like people do.

(You still should). Here&#x27;s a summary:<p>There are three particularly important defined concepts:<p><<Sec. 2 (5) (A) &quot;Threats&quot;>>, which means &quot;unauthorized activity&quot; that might plausibly compromise confidentiality, integrity, or availability, but that isn&#x27;t either protected speech or a mere ToS violation.<p><<Sec 2 (6) &quot;Indicators&quot;>>, the most important concept in the bill, which is, roughly: logs of recon activity, exploit techniques, vulnerability data, account hijack techniques (I think this bill actually tries to capture the notion of an XSS), bot C&Cs, damage reports on attacks, and anything else related to security and not already prohibited by law.<p><<Sec 2 (7) &quot;Defensive measures&quot;>>, roughly, things that stop or monitor attacks.<p>&quot;Defensive measures&quot; is a confusing concept in the bill. For awhile, it was thought that CISA would authorize something akin to hack-back privilege for private entities; it does not. Meanwhile, defensive measures are probably <i>already</i> lawfully shareable. Anyways, the bill allows you to share both indicators and defenses.<p>The bill allows the USG to share indicators and defensive measures with private entities, and vice versa.<p>So then:<p>Section 3 of the bill authorizes the USG to share stuff with private entities. This isn&#x27;t the part of the bill that concerns people (we all probably want <i>more</i> sharing from USG to private entities; for instance, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re saying every time we demand NSA fork over its zero-days).<p>Section 4 authorizes private entities to share with the USG.  Here&#x27;s what it allows:<p>(a) You can monitor your own systems, or those of people who give you written authorization, for any security purpose, notwithstanding any previous limitation on monitoring. Even if ECPA or student records law says you shouldn&#x27;t monitor, if you&#x27;re doing it to deal with security threats, you&#x27;re now allowed to.<p>(b) You can run your own defensive measures, or defensive measures on people who give you written authorization. Ok then.<p>(c) You can share indicators and defenses with the USG, and receive them from the USG so long as you comply with their sharing restrictions.<p>(d) You have to keep the data secure, you can&#x27;t share it willy-nilly, and before <i>you</i> share anything, you have to (1) review it for PII and (2) anonymize any PII you find.<p>Sec 4 (d) (4) has problematic language that allows, say, Facebook to provide written authorization to the USG to prosecute based on shared indicators; in theory, they can do this even if the prosecution they&#x27;re going to launch isn&#x27;t related to a computer crime, but just happens to be illuminated by the indicator Facebook shared. (But remember: Facebook can&#x27;t share under CISA unless they have a bona fide cybersecurity purpose for doing so).<p>Section 5 has a bunch of rulemaking authority in it, but buried in it is Sec 5 (d) (5) (a), which gives all the purposes FedGov is allowed to use indicators for:<p>* any security purpose\n* attributing threats\n* determining whether threats are foreign\n* preventing immediate disaster/harm (iv)\n* stopping child sex trafficking (v)\n* stopping major felonies, espionage, trade secret theft (vi)<p>(iv), (v), and (vi) are major problems; these aren&#x27;t cybersecurity purposes at all, but rather a sort of &quot;these crimes are so bad that we&#x27;re allowed to repurpose indicators to deal with them&quot;, which, maybe fair enough (except for trade secret theft), but still, not OK that new investigative capabilities are buried in the middle of a cybersecurity bill.<p>And that&#x27;s it.",1445890883

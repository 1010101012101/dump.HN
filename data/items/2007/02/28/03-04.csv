I'm sure all of these are just as applicable now as when he wrote them.  It all boils down to genuine confidence in your product.  If you're truly confident (not just optimistic, which we should be also) you won't get strung along by the VC's- you'll do your work, make a level pitch and move on until you find the one that matches well.  Similarly you will be more honest with your pitch.  This kind of confidence you only get with real business experience and/or real customers really using your product.<p>When you land a VC deal and get $4mil, are you going to dance around with euphoria and say ""we did it! we did it!"" or are you going to say ""well, that'll be 2 years to capture x percent of the market instead of 7 years- I hope it was worth giving up x percent of the company.""  If only the former, then you can take that as a clue right now that your business isn't quite ready probably.<p>(I'm being a little facetious- of course you'll celebrate regardless).",1172634523

It does seem though that you an approach this type of power with some of the dynamic features of Python.  Am I wrong here?  I think it's likely I'm missing the subtlety of macros.\n",1172632585

1453,comment,1338,1339,0,0,jamiequint,,,"Rails, but I can't judge Django because I haven't played with it on more than a superficial level. It seems like it really comes down to preference. I love the Ruby (and Rails) community right now and there are a lot of hopes for Ruby 1.9 as far as speed goes (supposedly an order of magnitude faster than 1.8.5).",1172631740

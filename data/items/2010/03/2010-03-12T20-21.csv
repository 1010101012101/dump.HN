He is by far one of my favorite entertainers because he makes very clear that everything he does is a matter of manipulative psychology and ""sleight of hand"".<p>Which makes it all the better because you spend the whole episode trying to figure out how he managed it - and wondering if the solutions (which he often provides) are actually real.<p>The other great thing about Brown is that he loves debunking pseudo-science and other rubbish. The section in one of his books about Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is a fantastically well thought out debunking - he actually tried NLP at one stage in his early career and you can see his fascination with the idea before his final realization it was just pop psychology (his section on religion is equally compelling).<p>But best of all he pulls some awesome stunts/tricks. Highlights from the past include: playing Russian roulette, live.... (with blanks, but still lethal...) and (my personal favourites) ""programming"" a group of people to pull off a fake heist and paying for stuff (in the US as it happens) with paper instead of real money.",1268427597

This may be something that is specific to programmers on small teams. I think many of these metrics apply to other areas in business such as Sales where there may be a relation between phone calls or emails and results (Or similarly in customer relations or customer service).<p>A common exception when programming is fixing bugs.

It's not about the flick of the mouse- it's about not having to aim (e.g., can you perform this action using your peripheral vision?).  It sounds like you've become accustomed to aiming at everything and therefore don't see what the big deal is.  Obviously the designers in question feel as you do, so it's certainly widespread.<p>As for the research, just to further clarify- they rigged a mac so that there was a second monitor above the first monitor (and above the main mac menu) that the mouse pointer could move to.  When mac users sat down to use it, even knowing exactly what was going on, they consistently overshot the menu by an average of half a screen.

You can take away the right of people to hold companies accountable for their actions, and this would really free up businesses to innovate without fear of reprisal. This would also open it up for businesses to 'innovate' in 'cost-savings' where 100% of the risks are borne by their customers. Do you advocate living in a world where corporations are free from fear, allowing them to do whatever they want? Do you really believe that corporations always operate in the best interests of their customers? Do you really think that the general population are the customers for most businesses (i.e. most people feel that they are 'customers' of the cable/television companies, but in reality the advertisers are the customers and the general population is the product)?",1268426518

Anyone with a basic grasp of magic technique can start to see his use of some very traditional methods.<p>One of the many brilliant aspects of Derren's performance is how he uses the notion of ""psychological manipulation"" as misdirection. We as spectators naturally look for an explanation for what we see. Magicians have always sought to provide an explanation for the audience, hence the waving of wands and the use of ""magic words"". Most of these explanations are deeply unsatisfactory, but Derren's is uniquely compelling.<p>Most magicians think too much about trying to fool their audience, believing that it is sufficient merely to do something that seems impossible. Derren understands that to engage an audience they must <i>want to believe</i>. Imagine if all magicians really did have the powers that they purport to have. There's nothing particularly exciting about someone who can make sponge balls vanish or candles appear out of thin air, but the ability to control minds is thrilling and dangerous. The imagination overflows with possibility. He performs an illusion that is exciting to watch and gives us an explanation for that illusion which is yet more exciting.<p>One of the things I keep meaning to write when I get round to starting a blog is a discussion of what UX designers can learn from magicians. I think one of the most important aspects of Apple's design culture is their focus on creating wonder and joy and their use of illusion and misdirection.

They didn't saw the possibilities that their costumers could be found. They were stupid and reckless.<p>The problem is that you're thinking about this situation as the researcher, the person who wants the data set to play with. Put yourself into the company's shoes. You want to improve the recommendation algorithm. You hold a contest, which needs the costumer data to work. But you know that your costumers won't be happy to have their info released, so you go and anonymize the data.<p>See where I am going? You had an idea, executed, but the consequences were bad.

That's sort of your experiment right there. Costs are holding steady despite a pretty messed-up patient population, doctors and patients like the system, they have a very good electronic medical records system (which they've opensourced, btw) and they use those records to analyze the data and use the treatments that the evidence shows are most effective.<p>It's been widely reported that about 98,000 people a year die from avoidable medical errors, a lot of it from medication errors. Most hospitals won't talk about their error rates. The VA told everybody, then they fixed it. For example, in a VA hospital every patient has a barcoded wristband. So does every nurse, and every medicine bottle is barcoded too. Every time a nurse gives a patient a pill, she scans all three barcodes, and a computer checks to make sure the patient is getting the right medicine at the right time.<p>Most private hospitals have little incentive to fix errors, and certainly none to report them.

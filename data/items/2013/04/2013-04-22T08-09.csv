Efficient access to that data meant storage in native format, which meant that supporting two languages would require a nasty I/O layer for the interpreted language.  Not worth it.<p>And that's just for the problems where it was possible to consider using Perl/Python at all.  For some problems, the memory overhead of Perl/Python data structures ruled out use on all but the smallest problems.  Again, not worth it.<p>It's nice that the speed-critical parts of your problem were reducible to a few lines of code, but that's not often the case.  For most real problems, I/O is a huge concern, and can't be dismissed just by pre-processing the input.",1366621030

5588468,comment,5573181,5577502,1,0,EnderMB,,,"> You're charging a lot to deal with it, which incentivizes clients to stop asking for it.<p>On the contrary, clients couldn't care less about how hard something is for us to do. Sure, if you're working for a creative agency and people are held back by the limitations of what they can accomplish when dealing with IE6 you'll notice a drop in morale, and in the quality of work that is produced, but ultimately the client does not care. Would you care if a plasterer said that plastering your ceiling would cost more because of the materials used? You'd still want it done, because the perceived value far outweighs the cost of doing the work.<p>Some of my employers' clients are large companies, with fairly large budgets and a good idea of what they want and what they need. As a result, despite charging a lot more for legacy browser development (easily over double, last time I checked) the client is fine with this. If the client believes they are earning 2k a month from IE6/7 users then charging 5k extra for a job that originally cost 2k isn't a problem for them.<p>> With the extra money you are charging, you can, if necessary, pay someone to fix bugs in jQuery that affect those clients' projects. You can contribute those patches back. Everyone wins.<p>Absolutely, and on occasion I've been lucky enough to contribute my findings from work to Stack Overflow, or directly to a broken open-source project. Hell, one of my best answers on Stack Overflow was as a result of fixing a problem at work that numerous others appear to have with a certain jQuery plugin.<p>However, this falls apart if you're working towards deadlines. The client often isn't going to wait very long for you to fix an issue in a product you use, and if they know that you're spending their time and money fixing a bug in a product you use the first thing they'll ask is ""why don't you use something that works like [competitor]?"". The reality of the situation is, like many others, when working towards a deadline with legacy browsers everything is a hack, and not a hack that we are necessarily proud of. I usually don't care what I publish, because work I'm proud of a few months ago looks inefficient or ugly to me now, and frankly I'm quite happy to have people criticise my code if they offer better solutions, but I'm willing to bet that a lot of people either won't publish their fixes, or would risk their jobs if they were found to be publishing code written on company time. I've worked for companies that would probably flip if they discovered that I had patched a plugin with code that I had written for one of the companies projects.<p>> I understand your emotional response to ""losing"" support for browsers, but this is not a story of open source failing you. You could have been paying for a proprietary library instead of using jQuery. jQuery has already saved you thousands by being free. You don't get to dictate the project's direction, but you have lots of savings ready to patch it as needed.<p>A developers emotions are different to the ""emotions"" of a company or a client. A developer is more likely to understand the rationale of this decision, whereas a company or a client won't care. All they want is a working product as quickly and as cheaply as possible.",1366620831

He gives a perfectly good explanation why he quit within the speech:<p><i>Drawing comic strips for five years without pay drove home the point that the fun of cartooning wasn't in the money; it was in the work. This turned out to be an important realization when my break finally came.<p>Like many people, I found that what I was chasing wasn't what I caught. I've wanted to be a cartoonist since I was old enough to read cartoons, and I never really thought about cartoons as being a business. It never occurred to me that a comic strip I created would be at the mercy of a bloodsucking corporate parasite called a syndicate, and that I'd be faced with countless ethical decisions masquerading as simple business decisions.<p>To make a business decision, you don't need much philosophy; all you need is greed, and maybe a little knowledge of how the game works.<p>As my comic strip became popular, the pressure to capitalize on that popularity increased to the point where I was spending almost as much time screaming at executives as drawing. Cartoon merchandising is a $12 billion dollar a year industry and the syndicate understandably wanted a piece of that pie. But the more I though about what they wanted to do with my creation, the more inconsistent it seemed with the reasons I draw cartoons.<p>Selling out is usually more a matter of buying in. Sell out, and you're really buying into someone else's system of values, rules and rewards.<p>The so-called ""opportunity"" I faced would have meant giving up my individual voice for that of a money-grubbing corporation. It would have meant my purpose in writing was to sell things, not say things. My pride in craft would be sacrificed to the efficiency of mass production and the work of assistants. Authorship would become committee decision. Creativity would become work for pay. Art would turn into commerce. In short, money was supposed to supply all the meaning I'd need.<p>What the syndicate wanted to do, in other words, was turn my comic strip into everything calculated, empty and robotic that I hated about my old job. They would turn my characters into television hucksters and T-shirt sloganeers and deprive me of characters that actually expressed my own thoughts.<p>On those terms, I found the offer easy to refuse. Unfortunately, the syndicate also found my refusal easy to refuse, and we've been fighting for over three years now. Such is American business, I guess, where the desire for obscene profit mutes any discussion of conscience.</i><p>It's strange to hear an argument for not selling out in an age where plenty of artists, even some of the most talented ones, have shrugged and accepted that being a sell-out is the quickest way to go about making money for doing what you love. I wonder if Watterson was simply old-fashioned, or if he noticed something that nowadays we're less capable of noticing.",1366620250

Also without some research to 'prove' that it works better it's even harder.<p>Parents/grandparents are a good angle too - but we're not exactly sure how to reach those. Reaching students, who might be actively searching for anatomy learning material, is hard enough... Reaching their families might be even harder. And how would those family members <i>know</i> that this is what their beloved actually need?? So it's a tough problem for us right now.<p>On the other hand, we have students who are willing to pay for this. Even when we had around 10% of the content, perhaps because it was good enough for them. And we see a pretty steady week-on-week growth in our active subscriptions of around 8% per week. Those students already pay for anatomy atlas and textbooks, so it's not unheard of for them to pay for the learning materials to help them study.<p>The numbers are still low, and that's why we're looking for some sort of a stop-gap funding via some freelance work.

If they were property, the addresses would be held and hoarded as investments (which can be seen in the subset which is already owned in this manner). They would also fragment, which leads to worse performance and higher costs. Given those two reasons, the first point fails under the label of really bad idea.<p>> it's possible that most Internet users are poorly-served by first-class addresses!<p>Internet users, or let's call them end users, want to use software that works, is effective and thirdly cheap. Software that has those 3 attributes serves them. However, with NAT, those attributes are directly harmed. Some software will never work with NAT. Of those that will work, some are much less effective, such as harmed latency and privacy. And thirdly, NAT adds costs to software development in from of complexity, meaning that the end cost for users increase. Thus, because of NAT, software is less useful and more costly, which in turn <i>harms</i> Internet users.<p>> Who says IPv6 needs to be the future?<p>IPv6 was the smallest possible change to fix the problem, while still maintaining a form of performance requirement that overlay networks don't. Performance here being 1) latency, 2) router capacity, 3) privacy/security. If a new protocol would fulfill the performance requirements, then there would be a reason to discuss replacing IPv6 with something better, but until that time is here, IPv6 is the upgrade that is necessary for the Internet, end-users, and suppliers.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.arin.net/policy/nrpm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.arin.net/policy/nrpm.html</a>",1366618584

Each of those servers could likely be put together for $500 - at $100/month, he should be making very good margins after a year or so. I have no idea on rent/electricity/etc, but with enough 1U servers the total cost per server may be only $10/month or so.<p>The big costs you pay for on AWS are the engineering, networking and UI development. Dedicated servers should be easier to provision and manage and he probably has a much smaller team.<p>So theoretically, it is possible that his prices are half as much as Amazon and he still makes a decent profit.",1366617861

One of the automated tests I wrote had a component that would periodically (at random intervals) kill processes, unmount shared filesystems, offline interfaces, etc. to cause failovers, to verify that all processes and resources were failed over, and all tasks were reassigned to other nodes and no jobs were dropped or stalled.<p>It is really the only way to ensure you've covered your bases - beating the shit out of your system repetitively.

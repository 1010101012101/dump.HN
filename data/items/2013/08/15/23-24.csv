So my choice to go with a windows phone shouldn&#x27;t to be dealt with a degraded experience.<p>If you were a youtube user then, you were using the website - which is PERFECTLY USABLE on your windows phone. Your experience is not worse in any way than it was then (although it might not be as good as android or ios users; but then, you didn&#x27;t buy an android or an iphone)<p>> Had MS or Apple pulled a similar crap, everyone would be crying an antitrust river and carrying a nail to the cross. Why does Google get a free pass at this?<p>Google is asking Microsoft to respect terms of service - nothing more, nothing less. Twitter does it every other week, and so does facebook - and people are upset, but everyone understands that this is entirely within their rights. (Unlike stuff Microsoft did, for which it was convicted of antitrust violations).<p>> Its by now clear that Google wants to provide a degraded experience to the windows phone users, thus deliberately rigging the market place.<p>The only thing that&#x27;s clear is that Microsoft is using its customers as pawns in a PR game against google. I know what my response to that would have been: No more MS products.<p>> What guarantees that the same wouldn&#x27;t be pulled when Firefox OS or Ubuntu OS comes to the market? If so what can possibly replace Youtube? 90% of the video links on the web are to Youtube.<p>AND THEY ALL WORK PERFECTLY WELL ON YOUR WINDOWS PHONE, INSIDE THE WEB BROWSER, LIKE LINKS ARE SUPPOSED TO!

Unlike C#, Clojure can achieve this with a user-level macro, instead of a compiler change. Both C# and core.async differ from Go, in that Go&#x27;s coroutines have dynamic extend, by virtue of being heap-allocated stacks with a custom scheduler. In practice, this has a minor impact on higher-order usage of co-routines, but is a smaller problem than you&#x27;d think, it&#x27;s generally advisable to minimize higher order usage of side effects.<p>Both C# and Go&#x27;s approaches can be implemented as Monads, yes. However, Monads are a significantly more abstract thing than either CSP or C#-style Tasks. The do-notation is barely concealed continuation-passing style, which is generally less pleasant to work with than traditional imperative constructs for side effects such as send & receive. &quot;More powerful&quot; isn&#x27;t a really useful measurement for practical use.",1376610185

And if it were always more performant to use a regular expression for this task, I would encourage the use of this tool to do so. However, depending on the data structure containing the strings, it may be more performant to simply search that.<p>> &quot;it is one character longer than what was produced&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not about the length of the pattern that matters. Rather, it&#x27;s the performance characteristics of the underlying state machine once the expression is compiled.<p>> &quot;Why not use the simplest possible syntactic sugar?&quot;<p><pre><code>  (?:Clojure|Clojars|ClojureScript)\n</code></pre>\nWhile this is certainly easier to read and understand, it will have performance drawbacks when using an NFA engine where backtracking is a real thing. It will also have a larger number of states when compared with the alternative.<p><pre><code>  Cloj(?:ure(?:Script)?|ars)\n</code></pre>\nSuppose I am interested in testing if &quot;ClojureScript&quot; is a member of the set of strings described by the first expression. To be in a final state I will have to enter no fewer than 25 states and backtrack twice. With the second expression I will only need to enter 13 states before being in a final state and will not backtrack at all.<p>For small patterns the choice to use something like frak is arguably splitting hairs; you won&#x27;t gain much other than you didn&#x27;t have to write an expression. But for enormous patterns, like the one I share in the README, there are real benefits from the sort of optimization frak provides.",1376609412

You&#x27;d have to repeat that code.<p>Await has a potential of simplifying the structure a lot, because it befriends asynchronous operations with control flow.<p>>And finally, &quot;await&quot; is only applicable when a single callback gets called once at the end. If you&#x27;re passing a callback that gets used repeatedly (a sorting function, for example), then normal-style callbacks are still necessary, and not harmful at all.<p>Indeed, await is only for the cases when we abuse functions (because we don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;ll call, and we have to bend our minds). Passing the sorting comparator is the primary <i>use</i> of first-class functions.",1376607749

3227522,comment,3225917,3227474,8,0,calibraxis,,,"Let's not forget our anti-war movements, which are just as much a part of our culture as apple pie and militancy. Mark Twain wrote:<p><i>""Man is the only Patriot. He sets himself apart in his own country, under his own flag, and sneers at the other nations, and keeps multitudinous uniformed assassins on hand at heavy expense to grab slices of other people's countries, and keep them from grabbing slices of his. And in the intervals between campaigns he washes the blood of his hands and works for 'the universal brotherhood of man'with his mouth.""</i><p>Mark Twain, for those who don't know, is one of the US's most defining authors; I read his fiction as a schoolchild.<p>I think the answer to the OP's question is simpler: We're the world's most warlike people, spending probably more than the rest of the world combined on military. So it stands to reason we'll have a pro-war propaganda budget.<p>That's a more hacker-like explanation, at any rate, as I imagine hackers tend to avoid anything that smells like ideology, and prefer realpolitik arguments.<p>(BTW, I also think there definitely is an ethnic component; that of the European peoples who are categorized as ""white"". It's reflected in the language we're speaking now, as well as culturally and racially. Those who come from elsewhere are referred to as ""ethnic minorities"", pretty much implying an ethnic majority. Plus, we have developed many national mythologies during our centuries, to make up for history only starting with our conquering of the land from the mostly exterminated indigenous population.)",1321091683

Furthermore, if you're aware that anybody who develops something new would have anyway to develop the interaction differently for your mobile device, and that the main benefit of my extension is for the already deployed code (the one designed for the desktops).

3227511,comment,3222221,3222675,1,0,keeperofdakeys,,,"In general, if you are depending on a secret cryptographic algorithm, then you are doing something wrong. Cryptographic algorithms are horribly complicated, with many attack vectors you need to know, and prevent. Chances are, someone writing their own code isn't going to make a secure system. By using a known, secure system, it doesn't actually matter if people know what it is. A known system has been tested, and deemed to be 'secure'. If knowing the name did mean they could exploit it, then it probably isn't a good system to be using in the first place.<p>As an example, here is an attack you may not have considered. If you wanted to make an authentication system, you would want to compare a password with a stored password (or hash). Most people would do a byte by byte comparison of the passwords (or hashes). The problem is, a byte by byte comparison takes longer for a correct password (even if you use hashes), as the incorrect answer exits on the first compare failure. This is called a timing attack, and is an example of a side channel. Most people wouldn't even <i>know</i> that such an attack existed. This is why you want to use a known algorithm, because the people who wrote them know these kinds of attacks. So if people know your secure algorithm, they shouldn't be able to exploit that knowledge.<p>Here are two links posted here recently, which show these concepts very well. The third is an hour talk about cryptography in general, and I highly recommend it.<p><a href=""http://carlos.bueno.org/2011/10/timing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://carlos.bueno.org/2011/10/timing.html</a><p><a href=""http://syhw.posterous.com/two-amusing-side-channel-attacks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://syhw.posterous.com/two-amusing-side-channel-attacks</a><p><a href=""http://fosslc.org/drupal/content/everything-you-need-know-about-cryptography-1-hour"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fosslc.org/drupal/content/everything-you-need-know-ab...</a>",1321091083

However, the key word there is ""worthy.""  I don't see a lot of vets coming back with a lot of respect for the enemies in Iraq and Afghanistan.  At most, there is the kind of ""respect"" you give to a dangerous animal: you know it's not just a ""dumb"" animal, and you know it could strike at any moment without warning, so you have to keep your guard up without fail.  I think a big part of this has to do with how they fight: <i>deliberately</i> targeting civilians in order to create terror, killing entire families who are suspected of American sympathies, etc.<p>So if the question is:<p>><i>Do we (or should we) unequivocally respect anyone who risks their lives for a ""higher"" cause?</i><p>I think there are two criteria to consider:<p>1: Is the cause truly noble?

3227474,comment,3225917,3227186,14,0,lucasjung,,,"Others have stated some of the big reasons why service members get so much respect: they risk their lives for their country, they give up some of their Constitutional rights (although they also gain some extra rights, such as Article 31 rights), and they generally accept lower compensation than they might get on the outside (still true, but not nearly as true as it used to be).  I would add another reason: they accept the burden of spending many years of their lives away from home, often missing major life events (weddings, graduations, even the births of their own children), as well as the lesser burden of having to move every 2-3 years.<p>However, there's another side to your question: why is the U.S. like this, and not other countries?<p>My initial response would be to turn that around: why don't people in other countries hold military service to a higher level of respect, especially considering that some of the reasons given here for respecting the military (e.g. giving up rights or accepting lower pay) are <i>more</i> applicable in some other countries?  Just because the U.S. is unique in this regard, doesn't mean we're the ones doing it wrong.  There have been others who felt their nations didn't give their troops enough respect:\n<a href=""http://www.web-books.com/Classics/Poetry/Anthology/Kipling/Tommy.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.web-books.com/Classics/Poetry/Anthology/Kipling/T...</a><p>That being said, I think that there are some important differences in U.S. culture that help to explain the difference.  One thing relatively unique about the U.S. is that, unlike most nations, we do not have an ethnic identity.  For example, Spaniards can feel united in the fact that they are all Spaniards, the Japanese can feel united in the fact that they are all Japanese, etc.  Certainly there are ethnic sub-groups within most countries, but for the most part they have a national identity that is rooted in their shared ancestry, and of a shared history that in almost all cases predates the existing government by centuries.  Since the U.S. lacks that, we have a national identity rooted in ideals, embodied specifically in the Constitution.  There is certainly a great deal of political disagreement about the specifics of those ideals (and of the meaning of the Constitution), but the generalities are largely agreed upon.<p>So what does this have to do with the regard in which we hold military service?  Well, part of it is an awareness, dating back to our war of independence, that our Constitutionally guaranteed rights were underwritten by a lot of individuals who left their homes to fight for those shared ideals which define us.  We literally would never have come to exist as a nation if it were not for our military services.<p>We also have an ideal in this country of ""Citizen Soldiers.""  It is not unique to the U.S. (I believe it originated in ancient Greece, but please correct me if I'm wrong), but I think that the only nations that currently subscribe strongly to this idea are the U.S. and Israel.  It's the idea that our military consists primarily of individuals who are not lifelong military professionals: most of the people in our military serve for only a few years, then go back to being ordinary Americans.  This means that we have a lot of veterans spread throughout our society, so that almost everyone knows at least one veteran, raising cultural awareness of military life.  Conversely, in a nation where the military consists primarily of individuals who make a lifelong career of it, the military tends to be a little less visible to the bulk of the population because they don't have as many veterans to interact with.  There are quite a few nations with universal conscription (everybody has to serve for a few years), but with the exception of Israel, I haven't seen this same ""citizen soldier"" meme in such nations.  I think there are two reasons for this.  First, the time spent is very short (usually 2-3 years, as opposed to the minimum enlistment in the U.S., which is 4-5 years) and at the end of that time the choice is ""get out, or commit to a life-long career,"" as opposed to the U.S. military, which allows a succession of short re-enlistments.  The second reason is most important: in countries with universal conscription, it's just seen as something everyone has to go through, like high school, and the conscripts are not fully integrated into the military: they are given minimal combat training and are used primarily for drudgework, with more thorough combat training coming only after an individual commits to a professional military career.<p>Finally, I can't end without addressing this:<p>><i>America's wars post WW2 are mostly invasions of random third world countries against underequipped,and mostly untrained enemies, and even then the victory/defeat ratio is very mixed.</i><p>Our two biggest wars since WWII were Korea and Vietnam.  The Korean war was really a war fought against China on Korean soil.  The People's Army is hardly something to sneeze at.  The NVA was also a modern army, equipped and trained by the Soviets and the Chinese.  Our next-biggest war (and longest, by far) was Iraq, which showed that ""underequipped, and mostly untrained enemies"" can be quite deadly.<p>This statement also seems to imply that we should judge the merits of military service on the basis of our political views about the particular wars fought, and on the degree of success achieved.  In reality, we judge the merits of military service on the basis that these individuals volunteered to make tremendous sacrifices in service to a noble ideal: our Constitution, and the concept it embodies (a self-governed people).",1321089067

It would be antithetical to the idea of reliable electronic signatures to allow a party to evidence that they entered an agreement at any time other than the actual agreement date.",1321089052

They executed well on that space.<p>Whatever advantages they have on desktop (questionable IMHO) don't seem to be compelling or strong enough to win users over.

The one that we're used to is so normalized that it's unthinkable to do without, while the other is a scary abomination concocted by <i>foreigners</i>.<p>In fairness, some libertarians do favor privatizing things like fire and police, in which case I respectfully disagree, but admire their consistency.",1321088493

And Microsoft did what any rational monopolist would do, use it's monopoly power to stop spread of any other OS (by deals with OEM,etc), tried to enter other markets by use of monopoly, etc etc. Standard oil comes to my mind as another monopoly, but the market of petroleum was essentially not that free.<p>Now you may argue that the OS market was not technically free (as none has been in history of mankind), but I don't see any reason that why a better product would not gain monopoly in free market, and then, barring any restriction, why would the monopolist not (ab)use its power to maintain monopoly.",1321088432

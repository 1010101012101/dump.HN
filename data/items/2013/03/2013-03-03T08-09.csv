It came from the Massachusetts and the Delaware, who were mostly killed off as their land was stolen.  Africans were enslaved to pick cotton.  Children grew up in company towns and were sent down to the mines, or sent to work in dangerous factories for twelve or more hours a day in the US, England etc.  The English recorded this, like they do everything, quite diligently, their paper record of it is enormous.<p>For the corporate press and standard line, whatever the USSR did was wrong.  If its economy grew it was cruel.  If it devoted capital toward consumer goods and eased up on production demands, it was a stagnating economy proving socialism doesn't work.  Any choice they make is called wrong, no matter which choice they make.",1362301094

We have IRC for techies and Google chat for non-techies, along with Google Hangout for when we need some face to face discussion.<p>So far it's working pretty well. People who need to pick kids up from school pick kids up from school. People who need to receive deliveries or have plumbers round don't have to worry about taking time out to do so. Additionally everyone's travel costs are miniscule when not on customer site, which I think is a massive positive for all of us. On the whole I believe that a happy workforce is a productive workforce, and that creating stress for employees is counterproductive. If we need meetings we can have them.

5313017,comment,5310602,5312716,2,0,jfim,,,"I did read the original article. The problem is that their stack <i>is not concurrent</i>.<p>In a non-concurrent web application stack(like Rails), one request is processed at a time and further requests to the same node are queued. This means that if some request takes five seconds to answer, everybody that is queued on that node after that long request has to wait until the first request is fulfilled. That's the behavior they're seeing.<p>In a multithreaded or reactive web stack, other requests will get processed alongside the long request and, guess what, the problem doesn't happen unless <i>all</i> worker threads are processing long requests because the short requests will get processed alongside the long one by the other workers.<p>Assuming your stack has, say, 20 worker threads, the probability of your random load balancer overloading your node with 60 long requests given a large enough pool is small, assuming long requests are a small fraction of your load. If your concurrency level is 1, the probability of your node getting overwhelmed by long requests is much higher.<p>You can see it this way; if you have a stack that can only process one request at a time, the probability of that one single request processor getting backlogged is getting three heads in a row on a non-biased coin. If you have twenty request processors, the probability of that node being backlogged is getting three heads in a row for all twenty processors. Much less likely to happen.<p>They were told to run Unicorn, which from my understanding just forks the Ruby interpreter a couple of times to run in parallel. They decided not to (or were unable to).<p>They decided instead to whine about the problem and ask Heroku to build some magic load balancer that would solve all their problems. Even if they did have a load balancer that did least-conns, all of Heroku's traffic does not go through a single load balancer, meaning that separate load balancers could, through bad luck, allocate their requests to the same unfortunate node. [1]<p>What they did is amateurish; instead of looking at the problem and fixing it by either multithreading their code or switching away from RoR, they blamed their vendors, just like beginning programmers blame their bugs on the compiler or the libraries they use. When Twitter needed to scale, they moved some of their stuff away from Rails to Scala, Facebook wrote hiphop php, their PHP to C++ transpiler, etc.<p>Was Heroku completely in the clear? No. Their documentation was misleading and I believe they've admitted that. Was it a problem that New Relic didn't show all the metrics needed to isolate the performance issue? Yes.<p>We'll see how this whole story unfolds, but from my perspective, the more of a stink RapGenius raises, the more amateurish they look.<p>[1] <a href=""http://aphyr.com/posts/277-timelike-a-network-simulator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aphyr.com/posts/277-timelike-a-network-simulator</a>",1362300309

Whether it's bitcoin or NoSQL, you need to reach some sort of critical mass or it's game over. As a general rule, if your idea is good there must be people out there who can get really passionate about what you're doing and you have to be able to find them. The earliest adopters. To them you have to provide what pg calls the quantum of utility.<p>You don't create these early adopters as much as you discover them. If the problem is real then the pain points are real and then people will automatically care about your solution and spread the word.<p>We programmers hack away at projects in the weekends, because it's what we love to do. Frequently we gravitate to projects that somehow make our lives easier. Maybe we just need a couple of scripts to grep through a music library or maybe something to reliably diff SQL table layouts. Of course it's not just programmers, it applies to makers of all sorts. For instance you'll see mechanics modify office chairs so they can work comfortably in odd positions.<p>These makers who hack together solutions for themselves aren't early adopters, they <i>precede</i> the early adopters. They're not just people who realize a some half-baked startup product prototype is useful but people who immediately see how it can potentially change the world exactly because they considered building it 9 months ago. A long time ago we learned that it's madness to market new products to Laggards. It doesn't matter that they need what you've made and that they have money. It doesn't matter because you have to persuade every Laggard individually. And that way you can't grow.<p>I'm thinking that in the same way targeting early adopters is madness when you can target Makers instead.<p>If startups are all about traction, who is a better advocate for your product than somebody who's been playing with the idea for the past year during their weekends? Nobody! If you have an army of makers as your first users and customers the regular early adopters will follow automatically. And with traction like that you'll be unstoppable.

Consider this rumor.  Also, I am not an electrical engineer, so I may be talking out of my ass.<p>As best as I can tell, Lightning is not (yet, anyway) a real protocol like Firewire, USB, etc.  What it is so far is USB with a different connector and some negotiating chips.<p>So when connect your lightning-USB cable to your iPhone, your iPhone squawks and says ""What is this?""  and the cable says ""I'm USB"".  The iPhone then sets its pinout to USB mode and off you go.<p>What's so great about this, why not just use USB?  I think the secret sauce is that Apple wants to surreptitiously invent new pinouts with faster data rates, without consulting any standards bodies and having to rally industry support on TVs, computers, et al.  They just build some new controller to push Lightning at 2Gbps+, put it in new iPhones, and build active cables that spit out HDMI or UHDTV or USB3 or whatever it is the kids are doing these days.  The active cables degrade gracefully for hardware running at the slower data rate.<p>What I think you are seeing right now, is the dry run with the off-the-shelf controller.  Get manufacturing ramped up.  You need this to plug your phone into a computer anyway.  But it's just the tick.  Wait for the tock.<p>Now the only thing that puzzles me is why they settled on 8 pins, when USB3 is 9.  Obviously they wanted an even number so you could plug it in every which way, but you would think stepping up to 10 pins would let them use off-the-shelf USB3 controllers instead of USB2.  Maybe they can do USB3 on 8-pins somehow, or maybe the tock will be ready fast enough that it's not worth it.<p>Further reading: <a href=""http://brockerhoff.net/blog/2012/09/23/boom-pins/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brockerhoff.net/blog/2012/09/23/boom-pins/</a>",1362298758

This is such a big problem because the video you are playing has already been lossy compressed (H.265) and it will most certainly not get better by a second pass that only has the raw pixel data available.<p>I could imagine people want to play 4k movies from their mobile device on their TV, but you wouldn't install a 4k screen as the display on the mobile device.<p>Edit: Yes, computer is inaccurate. I wanted to get the idea across that we are talking about connectors (DVI, HDMI) that you would normally use to hook up a computer or laptop to a TV or LCD. They have only recently appeared on mobile devices, but serve the same purpose here: video (and audio, for HDMI) out.",1362298252

Burning him at the stake is just a way to assign blame when in reality every person that ever evaluated Mannings psychological profile had been asleep at the switch.

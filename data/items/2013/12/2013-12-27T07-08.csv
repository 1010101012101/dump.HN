Unfortunately, it was a &quot;good ol boy&quot; lawyer who was more concerned with her relationship with the prosecutors office. They told her to accept the plea bargain, and she told me to take it since it&#x27;s the best that I&#x27;ll ever get. I was young and impressionable and didn&#x27;t even think of getting another lawyer.<p>To this day, I do everything within my power to avoid that County. Anecdotal evidence among my friends indicates that I&#x27;m not the only one that avoids Williamson County, the county just to the North of Austin, because of a fear of the unchecked legal system there",1388131198

It starts off with a really cool premise and then goes on to equate &quot;programmer culture&quot; with using the command line.  I think the author is spot on when he describes how user&#x27;s think about software/apps, but obviously the command line is not the be all and end all of how programmers think about software, it&#x27;s just (a very important) one of many tools.<p>One group of people have no idea what programming is, the other group do.  It&#x27;s not that complicated.  There is no user/programmer culture divide, it&#x27;s simply a matter of understanding a complex topic or not.<p>I think a lot of &quot;programmers&quot; use apps and other software like &quot;users&quot;, but when something goes wrong we like to hunt down the solution and fix it, and I think that explains why it is not uncommon to hear programmers complaining about how stupid the people who wrote the software they use everyday must be; because it can be frustrating and annoying when it ends up being something really obscure.<p>Programmers have a better understanding of how software works, but just like everyone else we get frustrated and annoyed when our app&#x27;s crash. We can complain in more elaborate and accurate ways than the average person is all.",1388131071

If the goal is just to <i>use</i> the computers as a means to some other (non-tech) educational end, e.g. as browsers for accessing online information, then Chromebooks seem like a reasonable method of doing so. If the goal is computer education, then I agree they&#x27;re suboptimal; even something like a Raspberry Pi might be better for that kind of education.<p>One lingering unease I have about the first use-case, though, is that it forecloses some unplanned exploration. I largely got into tech by fiddling around with lightweight programming on machines that weren&#x27;t explicitly bought to teach programming. Perhaps web-based dev environments will fill that gap, though; someone with a Chromebook can still experiment with anything from Codeacademy to jsFiddle to sketchpad.cc.",1388131070

For example an NSL or warrant with a gag order similar to what Lavabit saw. These warrants at least give the provider the option to shutdown. Also see similar situation to PrivateSky (UK-based). The fact that these cases are news, and even moving through the courts on appeal, is a Good Thing (TM).<p>This is a significantly different attack model than NSA hacking your network and picking data off your internal pipes (like what happened to Google), Firewire/Thunderbolt ports (commercial off-the-shelf products sold to law enforcement do this through DMA access granted by Firewire/Thunderbolt), or hell, even stealing keys through the ground potential of your chassis . Those techniques, sans warrant, are claimed to be &quot;legal&quot; only <i>because</i> they happen overseas.<p>If you think the NSA doesn&#x27;t have access to all your traffic just because you&#x27;re in Germany, I&#x27;m saying, IMO the NSA has <i>better</i> access to your traffic, indeed all your gear, <i>because</i> it&#x27;s in Germany.<p>> For international customers it is rather pointless to talk about data that never leaves the US. If this is a bad reaction, then what is a meaningful reaction?<p>This is a great point. I think the most meaningful reaction would be an increase in self-hosted SaaS models which are open source but not MIT/GPL as in, auditable but not free. Continuing the evolution of systems like Docker, and maybe even to an extent things like node-webkit, you might get to a future where grandma can single-click self-host all the apps she needs on any OS she happens to be running.<p>I&#x27;m so disappointed that such approaches are assumed to be doomed. You can&#x27;t convince the CEO that people won&#x27;t just comment out the license check rather than pay the license. I know GPL is supposed to provide &quot;freedom&quot; to the user, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything inherently wrong with providing access to the source while still legally requiring a end-user or commercial license, and not just in the form of a support contract. In fact, I really wish more companies would try this, because I think it would ultimately be very successful and if it can jump the shark as an acceptable approach, it would benefit the entire industry. I plan on trying it myself with a few products, and I&#x27;ll definitely report my progress.<p>In short, we need to increase investment in designing, deploying, and maintaining secure systems and architectures, combined with demanding <i>real</i> end-user ownership and control over your own data, which means self-hosting the service and open source. In my opinion, moving the server to international data centers doesn&#x27;t provide any demonstrable value, and I believe just makes matters worse.",1388130379

We are walking into national debt that will exceed twenty trillion dollars and, if economic damage wasn&#x27;t enough we are undermining our tech industry in ways that could shift technology out of the US in so many ways it is hard to imagine.<p>OK, call me a moron and a zealot.  Please explain a few things to me then:<p>First, if over twenty trillion dollars in national debt isn&#x27;t a problem, how much would be? Is there a limit or we get to go like this forever with no consequences whatsoever?<p>Once you explain that, please elaborate on what could happen to our tech industry if the world turns against us for such things as the brutal intrusion into everyone&#x27;s lives by the NSA and other yet-to-be-identified players?  Are there consequences to this if we change nothing? Ever?<p>Finally, we are continuing to see the disaster that the ACA/Obamacare is proving to be.  The other day an article came out, I believe in Forbes, explaining how MILLIONS of Americans are --without realizing it-- assigning their property --their homes-- to the government when they sign up for the ACA and end-up going for Medicare.  It is one thing to want healthcare for everyone.  For reason&#x27;s sake, let&#x27;s do it right! This is nonsense.  Can you please explain how the ACA is a good thing when premiums double --or worst--, deductibles skyrocket, access to doctors, facilities and drugs is limited and, on top of that, you might have signed your estate over to the state without even knowing it?<p>I don&#x27;t know.  I could be a moron.  Still, I think the above issues stand on their own, having nothing to do with the messenger or the political alignment of anyone involved.<p>The fact is that the tech industry is under attack by our own government in more ways than one.  Never mind me.  Mind reality.",1388129951

6969726,comment,6969271,6969271,9,0,ACow_Adonis,,,"I say this as humbly as possible.  I&#x27;ve taught a few classes to newbies for work, and yes, I&#x27;m frustrated with how fast the powers that be expect classes to be taught. But one also has to accept how slowly you have to go to teach new material to newbies. I&#x27;ve gotten unsolicited feedback from students thanking me, and one even sent me an email saying I inspired him to learn more, which was really touching. I&#x27;ve also received the &quot;my god, you do it so fast!&quot; comment.  So with all due respect reading that post, that&#x27;s not a symptom of &quot;two cultures&quot; per se, its a symptom of bad teaching, and a complete miss-match of material/audience.<p>In what possible universe is presenting to a bunch of librarians unix/grep/git/latex/python considered sane?  Were the presenters really that mind-blind?<p>Half of those things are debate-ably not even programming, and all of them should be separate subjects.  There is little/no reason to teach UNIX/regular-expressions/git/latex to someone who is learning to program in python, assuming the course is made up of non-programmers and the goal is to introduce programming.  Its going to take them months/years before they&#x27;re even at a stage where they vaguely have a reason to use those tools rather than the tools at hand, and I&#x27;m sorry but most of them are not going to stick with it that long.  Do you know how long it takes to get assignment/arrays/loops/functions/variables/types/logic all working together?  We&#x27;re talking YEARS!  We all forget about it the same way we forget about how hard it is to speak our native tongues, but you might as well fly into a room of native Japanese people reading shakespeare for the lecture. Non-programmers do not understand &quot;AND&quot; or &quot;OR&quot;. And you&#x27;re worried about unix/collaboration tools when they&#x27;re going to struggle to write a 10 line program by themselves if they&#x27;re the gifted ones?<p>If you want to inspire someone to learn to program (and I&#x27;m on the fence as to whether its really possible to do so if someone isn&#x27;t inclined to hack things themselves anyway), then present them a real world task from their work/life they couldn&#x27;t solve with their current tools.  Then you need to show them how to solve it with programming, and only with the amount of programming learn-able (that&#x27;s how much they can learn, not how much you can present) in the length of the course, so they could do it themselves without you present.<p>If you cannot do this, either the kind of people who program are likely going to discover such things by themselves, or you&#x27;re probably wasting your time, because you can bet that they&#x27;re just going through the motions at their keyboards and their eyes glazed over from the moment you said &quot;statement/expression/function/assignment/Boolean/variable&quot;.  All your words do not mean anything to normal people!!!<p>/end rant.",1388127985

You must use Command-Tilde for that.\n- Apps offered for mac don&#x27;t have a consistent behavior for the close button. Some apps will close the window, but stay in the dock. Others will quit.\n- On Windows, if the first letter in the menu bar items is underlined, you can be sure you can just do Alt + that letter to open up that menu item. You could even move windows using one of the menu item options and arrow keys.<p>My biggest issue on switching from Windows to Mac was losing all those keyboard shortcuts.

If the subsidies disappear, the prices will be allowed to correct and those African nations would be able to lift themselves out of poverty with the earnings. The free market is not at all governed by supply and demand, it&#x27;s being interfered with the country with the most power. It doesn&#x27;t end there, by increasing the price of an essential commodity, it&#x27;s able to deny poorer countries from accessing it without not going into debt with World Bank, and with very little ability to repay the debt, the country is wide open for American corporations to set up whatever operation they can be allowed to by bribing that country&#x27;s elite, and extracting any other remaining resources in that country or by blood. The men and women in those countries wearing American uniform, firing American guns, flying American fighter jets, fighting along side with America&#x27;s war.<p>It&#x27;s essentially how pimps work by coercing prostitutes into a large debt they can never repay, and must work the rest of their lives to pay off the debt, with a large amount of it being paid to the biggest pimps in the area, and tribute payments to the king of all pimps.<p>It&#x27;s cleverly hidden through the language of international economics, and things like &quot;freedom and democracy&quot; for all parts of the world. Of course money and freedom sounds a lot better than trying to sell communism, but I personally believe, it&#x27;s still a form of world domination. The marginal materialistic life we enjoy in North America and the West, someone on the other side of the world is dying for it, because the market favors those with the greatest power, and by which the rest of the world must play by.<p>Nevertheless, I choose the lesser evil between the two evils.

This is exactly how Square&#x27;s new payment system is working. This is simply because a refund is not canceling the original withdrawal, rather it&#x27;s depositing the original transaction amount back. I&#x27;m not quite sure how a credit card company could determine the exact transaction link (other than just comparing merchant and transaction amounts). Maybe they just deduct the base points rate on the deposited amount. I then wonder how they would handle if I bought a TV during a promotion for a bonus 3% points and then returned it.<p>However, I wonder what would happen if I were to send money from my actual credit card to my Google Wallet (with no fees until Jan 6th, unless extended), and then use the Google Wallet card to use Square to send the money back to my bank account using my debit card.

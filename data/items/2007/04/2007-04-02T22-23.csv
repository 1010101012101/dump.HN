What's interesting though is that the level of discourse has been really high, and apparently we're good folks to have visiting other sites (according to this article).<p>Have you updated your traffic graphic recently?

Many of the links submitted have nothing to do with startups.  This isn't a general service like Digg or Netscape<p>And/Or<p>B ) The ability to subscribe to the 'best' list via RSS.  This one would be better than just getting all the noise of the 'new' list. Not great, but it's a start.

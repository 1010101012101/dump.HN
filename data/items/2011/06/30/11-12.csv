The real, complex, quaternion and octonion numbers are the only 'normed division algebras'. This basically means they are the only spaces with a notion of length in which mutliplication is invertible (division). These properties are needed for anything that we want to call 'numbers'. The fact that there are only 4 such spaces is quite a profound result and leads to a lot of other important results.

2713620,comment,2713330,2713330,28,0,WillyF,,,"I didn't realize that the unpaid internship situation is as bad in Ireland as it is here in the U.S. My startup helps college students find entry level jobs and internships, so I'm constantly aware of what the latest trends are.<p>One trend that really scares me is that there are some ""career experts"" whom I interact with regularly who offer their own unpaid virtual internships (I've seen lots of other internships like this, but the fact that career experts who are supposed to help interns are offering these really blows my mind). These are people who don't have the ability to offer many of the benefits that do come with an unpaid internship such as making connections, learning what it's like to work in a real office, having a recognizable name on your resume, etc.<p>Another trend that scares me is that we're seeing more and more internships auctioned off in charity auctions. Rich parents actually pay for their kids to get some experience.<p>Unfortunately, interns aren't going to be the ones to stop this trend. Unpaid interns do benefit from their internships. They mostly accept it as something that they have to do, and they know that if they refuse to take an unpaid internship, there are thousands of other students who will snap up the opportunity.<p>Change is either going to have to come from employers or the government. I strongly believe that offering paid internships is more favorable to employers because they get better quality interns who are more motivated, and the employer has a stronger incentive to use the intern's time well.<p>Here in the U.S. there are already laws against unpaid internships. I wrote an article on it here: <a href=""http://www.onedayoneinternship.com/blog/are-unpaid-internships-illegal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onedayoneinternship.com/blog/are-unpaid-internshi...</a><p>There's actually an excellent and fair standard for determining when an unpaid internship should be allowed; however, I've never heard of an employer's being prosecuted under the Fair Labor Standards Act for having unpaid interns. And if the law were to start to be enforced, I'm not sure the outcome would benefit students in the short-term. There would be a lot fewer opportunities as many employers would get rid of their internship programs. This would result in even more competition for what paid opportunities were left.<p>I really hate unpaid internships, but I still haven't figured out what it's going to take to make them a thing of the past. They've become an essential part of the transition from education to employment, and messing around with that in a time when really talented grads are struggling to land jobs probably isn't a good idea. We may have to wait until the economy really heats up again.",1309435007

2713510,comment,2713070,2713342,8,0,xyzzyz,,,"So one should introduce category theory along with its usage. Category theory makes little sense without it -- it turns to mundane symbol (or rather, diagram) manipulation. The category-theoretical notions do not seem to have any relevance if you do not know what other notions they try to generalize. What I mean is that it is more natural to notice that various products in all kind of mathematical structures have some universal property in common, than to say that these are examples of categorical notion of product. Or, it is more natural to notice that van Kampen's theorem really says something about connection between fundamental groups of a space and its subspaces, than to say that fundamental grupoid of a space is a colimit of a diagram created by fundamental grupoids of certain families of subspaces, with arrows being induced by inclusions. The second approach in case of van Kampen theorem (and many more, actually) is useful when you want to prove or use van Kampen theorem, because it is a bit easier to prove an universal property of a colimit than to prove that the fundamental group of a space is a free product product of the fundamental group of its subspaces with an amalgamation along fundamental group of their intersection. Nevertheless, categorical approach does not provide you with the intuition which initially led to the formulation of this theorem. I believe that the case is similar with your friend's work -- it's his intuition and insight which led him to notice this equivalence, and category theory only helps him formulate his thoughts in an elegant way.<p>Learning category theory before learning more substantial facts is in my opinion going totally in backward order. Or maybe I'm just an (metaphorically) old grump and refuse to acknowledge the revolution just like mathematicians in the beginning of twentieth century were refusing to accept set theory.",1309432564

Who can afford to do so ? Rich families. So it's a form of discrimination.<p>A company has <i>no</i> excuse for not paying at least minimum wage.

Luckily it never came to that and I ended up going back to work at the company for another 1.75 years, before I left to try out the world of freelancing and startups.<p>For the record, that company hires between two and five interns every year.

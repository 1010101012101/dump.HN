8174669,comment,8174143,8174310,55,0,matthewdgreen,,,"Hi Thomas. I used to think this way too. I think this is certainly a fine way to think about things if your goal is to keep encrypted email deployment limited to the 3-4% of email users who are either technical experts with nothing to say and/or people who are sending obviously sensitive documents. It doesn&#x27;t scale much beyond that.<p>Moreover, I would argue that a &#x27;translucent&#x27; key management infrastructure /can/ be better in all ways than PGP. For example, imagine that Google provided a transparent key distribution service for all its users, but also allowed you to verify key fingerprints manually before sending messages. Congratulations -- for users who care, you&#x27;ve got something that works every bit as well as PGP. Everyone else isn&#x27;t sending plaintext! Sure an attacker can compromise them, but it requires an expensive MITM attack. They have to be targets a priori, not after the fact. I&#x27;m struggling to see how anyone is worse off here, except through the nebulous reasoning that &#x27;making things easy&#x27; makes people careless. Making things hard definitely makes people careless -- I&#x27;ve seen this firsthand.<p>But more to the point, even paranoid users have a lot of options that are better than PGP. Using ZRTP to establish secure channels is a very safe way to do things, assuming your attacker can&#x27;t really forge voiceprints (and this seems hard, even for the NSA). From that point you can push strong public keys out to a dedicated text/email app. That we don&#x27;t do this is not so much because it&#x27;s a bad idea -- it&#x27;s because so far people haven&#x27;t tried it.",1407959064

Even operating from your premises, spending more can decrease costs.<p>In the case of no/low-interest loans, as long as the cost of defaults doesn&#x27;t exceed the amount saved in interest paid to banks, everyone is spending less money on education.<p>Combining no/low-interest loans with increased state funding for education significantly decreases the risk of default.<p>So the &quot;right answer&quot; to minimizing spending is just a matter of simply arithmetic:<p><pre><code>    C_f = Cost of state Funding\n    \n    C_d = Cost of Defaults\n\n    B_i = Total money saved on interest payments (let&#x27;s assume 5% rate with 20k load, probably higher if the entire market is unsubsidized) \n</code></pre>\nThen we want to maximize B_i - C_d + C_f.<p>Since we have some amount of state funding and some subsidized loans, it&#x27;s entirely plausible that increasing C_f could decrease C_d, because the loans are smaller and therefore risk of default is lower. Furthermore, decreasing C_d increases B_i since higher-interest unsubsidized loans will meet the new demand.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s a degenerate optimization: you can always just have zero subsidies. Most first world countries rightly give a shit about educating the non-independently-wealthy.<p>But also:<p><pre><code>    * I don&#x27;t think &quot;minimize cost&quot; is a wise philosophy wrt education. Nations that do this tend to be sucky places to live/work.\n    * America has a progressive tax system, so the aggregate reasoning of your first response is at least disingenuous.</code></pre>",1407958596

If it is true that spiking does well with unsupervised learning, then you could feed a bunch of input to a spiker, then scan it for components that could be mostly mimicked with a convolutional chip and reroute the inputs/outputs. (Yeah, the interconnect would suck.) The point is not to come up with some magic better-performing hybrid, but rather to explore an intermediate point in the design space of augmenting/replacing actual neurons with silicon. The IBM chip isn&#x27;t that close to biology, but it&#x27;s closer than a convolutional network, and a convolutional network is a much smaller step than a general purpose processor. We might learn about some simple augmentations that are likely to work in practice.<p>Also, the whole &quot;airplanes don&#x27;t flap their wings&quot; analogy can be taken too far.

Learning a new language, web framework, some JavaScript, using my existing database and coding skills and pushing them further.<p>Three and a half years on all I seem to do is fix the same excel upload errors (it was a temporary quick fix solution that has always been bottom priority for replacement), go to dumb meetings where they spend half an hour discuss the acronyms used in the menus, and change colour of items. I never get a chance to focus on anything that takes more than half a days coding, so basically all the interesting work is now replaced by trivial fixes usually where the users seem incapable of reading the error message (though with Excel it impossible to guess what the problem will be).<p>I was promised a promotion last year, but that hasn&#x27;t happened yet (I work in Spain, and government cuts mean it not allowed until we merge with another institute).

I think of the ElasticSearch API which lets you use Thrift or XML or JSON.<p>The interesting distinction between binary serialization formats is if the schema is separated from the data.<p>For instance,  if both sides of the system know you are encoding a 24 bit color value you can send 3 bytes and that is it;  coding and decoding can be very quick and even possibly done on a &quot;zero copy&quot; basis.<p>If you are using something like JSON you not only have the waste involved with converting &quot;255&quot; to an #FF byte,  but you also have to embed the schema in the sense of &quot;here is an array of three integers (which happen to be bytes)&quot; or &quot;here is key &#x27;red&#x27; and value R,...&quot;<p>Thus,  JSON is not &quot;schema-free&quot;,  it is &quot;schema embedded in the data&quot; and this inevitably bulks up the data and slows down encoding and decoding.  Yes,  general-purpose compression eats some of the storage/network encoding overhead,  but you&#x27;ll get it even tighter if you eliminate that fat before you put it through the compressor.<p>Now,  separating the schema from the data means you need to make both sides aware of it,  which is why you need some strategy for handling this in a systematic way rather than hoping things will work out OK without a plan.",1407957349

E.g. even trivial contents should be encrypted by default and this should be usable by default. Currently, S/MIME does a better job than PGP.<p>While the CA-model seems to be broken in most X.509 use cases, like  TLS/SSL, where a duplicate certifcate can be used to do a man-in-the-middle-attack, this does not really affect S/MIME, especially after both parties started a &quot;conversion&quot;. People that need to communicate &quot;really&quot; secure, should therefore be able to ignore all &quot;CA-Trust&quot; and white-list certificates on a per user basis (e.g. like PGP).<p>Ordinary communication still can by default fall-back to the existing CA-model to keep it usable (but not secure).<p>Some steps:<p>1. We need more love by the MUA-vendors, who mostly support S/MIME but it&#x27;s still a PITA to use. Google e.g. still does not support S/MIME on android, see <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=34374"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=34374</a><p>2. We need CAs that are usable. StartSSL is nice and free, but it&#x27;s not easy to use. Lower the entry barrier for getting and renewing/recreation of certificates<p>3. (most important) Make it easy to manage local CA-trust. On each new system, the user should be able to select a &quot;trust no CA/whitelist only&quot; approach and then be responsible for trusting other parties. No vendor (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Mozilla) should silently distribute and trust new CAs without users consent.",1407957316

While I'm sure there's a lot of noise in such data, my intuition is that people who wait til the last minute do a sloppy job and it affects their chances.",1207180750
153466,comment,152936,153335,0,0,webwright,,,"I disagree.  If everyone knows that an area is an amazing opportunity, then it's probably not an amazing opportunity.  Every single runaway success at some point had a whole host of people saying, ""That's ridiculous-- it'll never work"" on some level.<p>examples:<p>1) When google was on its way up, it was a well-understood fact that no one could make real money on search.  Oops.<p>2) When Excite was getting funding, everyone told them that search was dumb.  People would do 1 search and bookmark what they cared about (and would never search again).<p>3) The very idea of youtube (giving away tremendous piles of storage and bandwidth) didn't seem very smart to a lot of people.  Plenty of online video startups had failed.<p>4) Blogger couldn't get more funding and had to lay off their entire team.<p>5) If I described twitter to you 3 years ago, would you have been blown away by the idea?<p>6) Salesforce.com was not exactly warmly embraced by the enterprise when they first launched.<p>7) Marc Andreessen said he was constantly stonewalled by businesses when selling them stuff at Netscape. ""The Internet?  Inside our network?!  MADNESS!""<p>Hindsight make these ideas seem obvious-- but at the time, they were pretty ridiculous.<p>As you say, most ridiculous ideas ARE really ridiculous.  Thus the ""necessary but not sufficient"" part.",1207180606

153463,comment,153441,153441,0,0,ardit33,,,"haha....  it is like my CS professor.  We had to submit our programming assignments before midnight, and if it was more than a minute late, we would get a 0.  Needless to say that 90% of people waited until last minute to submit, and his little server will crash often (and you would hear screams from students not being able to submit).  Programmers are some of the bigest procrastinators, ever.<p>So, he decided to give 4 points bonus if somebody submited at least 24hrs before.  That actually worked, as more people started submiting earlier.\nSo, pg, maybe you need to give some incentives, or at least look at earlier sumissions more favoribly.",1207180495

This requires a large number of address pointers. When you move from a 32 bit environment to a 64 bit environment, those pointers grow from four bytes to eight byte each.

153456,comment,152836,153422,0,0,benreesman,,,"I'm not generally an advocate for SOAP. SOAP is good for basically one thing, which is sending Java/C# objects over HTTP and having them arrive on the other side looking the way you expect. My preference for languages like JavaScript leads to a preference for lightweight (mostly JSON-bearing) web services that most people would call REST. I agree that SOAP has been the subject of way too much promotion of the part of tools vendors trying to sell bloated web-services stacks.<p>The reason for my rant is that REST has become a battle-cry in some kind of reactionary anti-vendor uprising, which obscures the issue. The word REST has a very precise meaning and almost all of the celebrated 'REST' services (Flickr, Amazon, Facebook, etc.) fail to meet the criteria. Those services are just lightweight RPC over HTTP, and there's nothing wrong with doing a service like that. For client programs written in 'dynamic' languages, those kind of services are preferable.<p>REST is for documents, and time spent trying to find the 'resource' to be POSTed to in 'finalize this multi-step transaction between these two interest-bearing accounts' is time wasted. The linguistic gymnastics necessary to jam an RPC peg into a CRUD hole just make the service developer look silly.<p>Cheers.",1207180014

It's not just the <i>aspie</i> truck drivers, plumbers, carpenters, cops, factory workers, taxi drivers, and salesclerks that aren't getting any press: <i>none</i> of these blue-collar workers are getting any press.<p>One reason that aspie IT workers got enough media attention to become a stereotype is that white-collar workers actually have to interact with them from time to time.",1207179807

153448,comment,152962,153366,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I theorize that downward pressure on group size is actually applied at the application level...since they set aside a single long weekend for the interviews, and there are only so many hours in a day...they can't possibly interview everybody, and they may (consciously or otherwise) prune while reading applications in order to avoid having too many to interview.  That's just a theory, of course, and the size has been creeping up each cycle (to the point where I found the dinner I attended from WFP08 too crowded and noisy for comfortable conversation).  It could be that they'll eventually switch to having two interview weekends, or a whole week of interviews.",1207179373

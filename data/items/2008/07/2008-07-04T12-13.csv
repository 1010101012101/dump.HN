236182,comment,235942,236051,0,0,rplevy,,,"The fact that the two coexist does not constitute a valid argument for how things <i>should</i> be, in a better world.  There are many less-than-ideal things that coexist together with superior alternatives.  For example there are countries where women are required to cover their entire face in public, but the fact that they coexist with secularly governed nations does not validate theocracy as not being oppressive.  Similarly we have two ways of doing things coexisting with free and proprietary, and the world would be a better place if one of the alternatives was simply not present.<p>The line about financial incentive is very disputable as it is all about personal preferences.  I personally prefer emacs over eclipse (emacs just rules), gimp over photoshop (photoshop is bloated, doesn't run in Linux as far as I know, and I know how to use Gimp better), Inkscape is awesome, Flash sucks big time, and Windows is needless to say, horrible.<p>Free OS took 20 years? No I think freedom at the level of the OS was the original way of doing things, from the very beginning.  It's the proprietary software that got in the way making it difficult for modern free OSes to catch up by constantly setting hurdles by requiring free software to reverse engineer things that needed to be compatible.",1215176333
236180,comment,235390,236167,0,0,gizmo,,,"Geez. No.<p>int i[10]; does allocate memory for 10 integers (on the stack)<p>So i has the type int•. A pointer to a value: an array. A pointer to a value is the same thing as a pointer to the first value in the array. That's why you can use ++i, increment the pointer, and it will point to the second value in the array (++i => •i == i[1])<p>So &i is, wait for it, a int••, that is, a pointer to an array. So if you have an array of arrays, then you need to dereference twice. E.g. argv. It's a char••, so an array of strings which is an array of arrays of characters.",1215175992
236179,comment,235942,236070,0,0,krschultz,,,"No, the issue for Stallman is for the software to be open and stay open. There are many places where the GPL put limitations on what YOU CAN DO with the software. His whole ""rights for the people"" is a side effect of ""rights for the software"". By free he means the SOFTWARE is free, not the people using it are free to do what they want. There is a reason the BSD people complain like hell about GNU and the GPL. In my view, the BSD is 'free' software i.e. you can do what you want with it, and the GPL is 'shared' or 'collective' software i.e. you can change it, but you have to share all your changes.",1215175957

236176,comment,235706,235999,0,0,gaius,,,"OK, here's one example. I have an app that receives email, processes it, and sends it back. I need to get all its attachments, do work on them and build a new message. In Python parsing an email is:<p>import email<p>msg = email.message_from_string(sys.stdin.read())<p>How easy is that? The subject is msg[""Subject""]. Iterating over the MIME parts is 2 lines of code. I could build all the scaffolding very quickly, and concentrate on the problems I needed to solve. Maybe this is just as easy in LISP - if you already know where to get all the bits, and I don't, and I'm not good enough to write a production-grade RFC822 handler in a day.<p>I like LISP a lot and am trying to use it where I can, but at the end of the day, I have to get stuff out the door as quickly as I can...",1215175759

236174,comment,235942,236078,0,0,krschultz,,,"I agree with you on the point you are making. For example Hezbollah in Lebanon gains much of their power from their charity work - and uses that power for terrorist actions. BUT I don't think you can equate BillG with the mafia, villians, or terrorists. So in this instance, RMS is WAY off base, and winning himself no favors.

236169,comment,235993,235993,0,0,Herring,,,"> So if you think Microsoft's particular flavor of source control is redundant, you'll really hate Diet Cherry Chocolate Dr. Pepper.<p>ugh i hate analogies. Ryan's main point --which this article didn't address (he talks shipping)-- was that software builds (should build) on previous software. Can dr pepper do that? This analogy is supposed to say there are subtle differences between the products, but that's irrelevant to the original point.<p>><p>>There's simply no reason for MSTest to exist except to satisfy some bizarre corporate directive that Microsoft never ship open source code in their products.<p>Both you authors could do with an econ class. MS spends tons of money to reinvent subversion because they want to lock you in, thus getting more money to spend reinventing something else to lock you in. This has worked for them so far & it will continue to work in the foreseeable future.",1215175045

He'd make a lousy district attorney.<p>Of all the evil Microsoft did to the world, ""prosecuting"" them for writing propietary software is an unwinnable argument.  Instead of presenting arguments against illegal monopolistic practices he chooses the one thing Microsoft did that most people agree with: creating IP.  And by arguing against IP, he disqualifies himself from attacking Microsoft's biggest crimes: hijacking others' IP.<p>The U.S. government couldn't get Al Capone on any of the big stuff, so they went after tax evasion to put him away.  At least that was also a crime.",1215174781

236160,comment,235993,235993,0,0,gizmo,,,"NIH is the right attitude for MS. Microsoft makes a subversion clone. If the clone turns out better than subversion then a lot of .NET developers will use it voluntarily. A lot of businesses will start using it because it has the MS logo on it. Result? Microsoft owns a part of the development tool chain - which makes it harder for people to write software on different platforms. Microsoft wins.<p>And if the clone is worse? Doesn't really matter. Some people will still use it, version 3.0 may be ""good enough"", and Microsoft will have a new technology to market. Having new products is a goal by itself - the .Net magazines need fresh content to keep their audience captivated. Even vaporware can be very valuable. Microsoft wins again.<p>Conclusion: cloning popular products is good business for MS.",1215173589

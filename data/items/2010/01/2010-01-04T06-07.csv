Latin American immigrants come from similar range of poor, politically unstable backgrounds, yet their children aren't being driven to academic excellence by their parents.  In fact, instead of outperforming the white American natives, they substantially underperform them.  Why the difference?<p>Let me give an answer: it appears to be genetics.  Why else are the very different experiences of mainland Chinese, Chinese Hong Kongers, Chinese people from Taiwan, Chinese people from Singapore, Chinese people from Indonesian and Malaysia resulting in only minor differences in average outcomes in the USA?",1262588074

1029909,comment,1027274,1027274,0,0,michael_c,,,"(For what it's worth, I used to interact a lot with similar businesses when I was working for eBay plus I am currently running my own similar business).<p>Here are some tips:
1. Keep your costs very low while you are figuring out if there is a market. If possible, use sites like shopify, eBay, Amazon, etc to find some first buyers for minimal web development and only order a relatively small amount of inventory - hopefully you won't end up with a pile of un-saleable inventory while working out if this can sell.<p>2. If you can source the inventory cheaper than is the current market price, that can be a good advantage - but don't think that cost will be your only advantage without worrying about marketing etc.<p>3. When calculating your sale price, factor in fraud, refunds, wastage, etc. Regarding fraud, it seems like a regular occurence - be hesitant shipping large orders to unknown customers with unverifiable addresses.<p>Hope that helps.",1262587307

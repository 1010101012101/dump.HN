BTW, M4 was chosen because:<p>> I [David Mackenzie] considered using Perl to generate my style of configure scripts, but decided that M4 was better suited to the job of simple textual substitutions: it gets in the way less, because output is implicit. Plus, everyone already has it. (Initially I didn&#x27;t rely on the GNU extensions to M4.) Also, some of my friends at the University of Maryland had recently been putting M4 front ends on several programs, including tvtwm, and I was interested in trying out a new language.  - <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.67/html_node/Exodus.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.67/h...</a><p>Portable tools got people (like me) to switch to GNU make, and GNU awk, and other GNU tools in order to get away from the non-portability of OS vendor tools.

I&#x27;ve had to write a script that&#x27;s basically a point-and click windows macro for each possible character, then compile the whole text with appropriate kerning. The process already takes several hours for each font, plus hand-corrections for any vector problems with the export.<p>At a lower level this type of v-bit carving is much more difficult compared to 2d operations like pcb trace milling. There are various tricks (<a href=""http://s485.photobucket.com/user/defaultname000/media/butterfly.gif.html?sort=3&o=19"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s485.photobucket.com/user/defaultname000/media/butter...</a>) you can use for computing vector offsets of arbitrary paths, but for v-carving you need to get the medial axis as well.<p>There is an another limitation - any individual stroke wider than about .09&quot; requires 2 passes to cover, which is not ideal since I&#x27;m basically selling machine time.

The US for example saw a substantial decline in its birth rate over 40-50 years, and it was not due to State suppression of sexuality or socializing. In fact the exact opposite occurred, sexuality was drastically liberalized in the 1960s and 1970s.

In fact I had a class at Cornell with someone who was studying how dragonfly wings fly, and in addition to momentum-transfer due to steady streams (like airplane wings) you can also have momentum transfer into vortices which are created by those wings.<p>In general I feel like this article has a lot of social detail and not very much physics. So, for example, someone who doesn&#x27;t really understand what pressure is will probably be totally unenlightened on why a moving fluid will have a lower pressure. In particular there is a <i>huge</i> caveat to saying that &quot;pressure + kinetic energy = constant&quot;, which is that this is a statement valid <i>on a streamline</i> of the fluid. (A streamline is a curve traced by a small group of particles in the fluid as they go downstream -- averaging out their individual jiggles so that we just see how the fluid overall is flowing. If you inject a steady stream of dye then it often shows a streamline, for example.)<p>If you&#x27;re not on a streamline then it might not hold. So for example, cut two holes in a bag, stick some tubes on either side, and have a fan blow into one of those tubes: now you&#x27;ve got air moving at a certain velocity inside the bag; yet it is <i>inflated</i> (higher pressure than the stationary air outside the bag) even though it is <i>moving</i> (which you would think would lower the pressure). Turn the fan around and the bag will be inclined to deflate. The air outside the bag is not on a streamline with the air inside the bag.<p>The transport equation looks like this:<p><pre><code>     ∂c/∂t + (v·∇) c = D ∇² c + Source − Sink\n</code></pre>\nThis equation tells a story: &quot;there is a box moving downstream (v·∇) which contains some stuff, with a certain concentration (c). The time-rate-of-change (∂/∂t) of stuff in the box is equal to the stuff moving into the box, minus the stuff moving out of the box. Some stuff is moving into adjacent boxes proportional to the concentration difference, in a process called diffusion (D); everything else is somehow going out of the scope of the fluid flow (Source − Sink).&quot;<p>The interesting thing about fluid mechanics, that leads to the Navier-Stokes equations, is that in classical mechanics we have conservation of <i>momentum</i>, which means that the fluid&#x27;s own momentum in each direction <i>is a stuff subject to this same story</i>. This causes the term (v·∇) c, in particular, to have two instances of v in it (it becomes &quot;nonlinear&quot;) and so everything becomes difficult to analyze -- which is why there&#x27;s a million-dollar prize to make some substantial progress in understanding the resulting equation.",1422480720

8962665,comment,8960504,8962257,0,0,api,,,"P2P doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean cooperative relaying or swarm distribution like BitTorrent. I agree that those applications are mobile-unfriendly with current batteries and cell networks. It just means you are talking directly to your peers instead of back-hauling to the cloud. You can have P2P where the only traffic you handle is your own. In that scenario total aggregate bandwidth shouldn&#x27;t be that different from a cloud-backhauled app -- the only difference you&#x27;d see is in how many endpoints you&#x27;re talking to. So instead of seeing 25mb transferred to/from one IP, you&#x27;d see it sprayed across a few dozen IPs.<p>The big hurdles I see are (in no particular order):<p>- Connection maintenance and keep alive. Basically this is bad, so you want to be more aggressive about shutting down unnecessary P2P links on mobile than you need to on desktop/server. Keep alive requirements generally suck anyway, and are one way NAT murders kittens.<p>- Restrictions around background tasks on mobile OSes (iOS is particularly onerous).<p>- Squelching inbound traffic from badly behaved or broken peers to avoid inbound flooding.<p>- Battery life and related concerns.<p>I understand it this way: cellular networks currently have their own &quot;netiquette.&quot; It includes things like don&#x27;t be too chatty, try to coalesce instead of spewing packets at excessively random times, etc. These things are less important on wired networks since they don&#x27;t have the same resource constraints or bandwidth issues.<p>I guess a related question is why you would do P2P and not backhaul to the cloud? I can think of many:<p>- Reduced latency for things like AR and VR where latency matters a lot.<p>- Reduced bandwidth cost due to lack of back-haul, and back-hauling a pic being sent between two people in the same city 2000 miles to a cloud server is just offensively stupid anyway.<p>- Privacy and security.<p>- With P2P you could have a more open app model where apps aren&#x27;t wedded to proprietary cloud infrastructure. They still work even without someone&#x27;s cloud, etc.",1422480641

For common patterns like &quot;xs.Select(...).Where(...).Aggregate(...)&quot;, if each function was inlined and pure, the resulting code could literally be equivalent to a big loop, as if you had hand-written the thing. No allocation all over the place, and much better resulting JIT&#x27;d code.

Title II reclassification may be an uphill battle, but any other proposal that I can think of has less than a snowball&#x27;s chance in hell of actually coming into effect, let alone achieving the actual goal.<p>We&#x27;ve already seen that there&#x27;s no way that the FCC can regulate a neutral net under its current authorization without classification under Title II - that&#x27;s almost literally what the federal court ruling last year said. And there&#x27;s no way that Congress will pass a new law that either expands the FCC&#x27;s authority or somehow provides for a neutral net independently of the FCC. So repurposing an existing piece of legislation is what we&#x27;re left with.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/forbearance-what-it-why-its-essential-net-neutrality-0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/forbearance-what-it-wh...</a>",1422480324

8962612,comment,8961551,8962517,0,0,WickyNilliams,,,"A render in react doesn&#x27;t return DOM elements. Render is a pure function which projects app state into a description of the view. Let&#x27;s call this description A, so  render(state) -> A. When state changes and render is called a second time we get a new description, render(newState) -> B. A diff is then applied to them diff(A, B). The diff can then be translated to an update strategy for the actual DOM (or in this case, native components). From this the smallest set of changes are applied to bring the DOM in line with the current state. It turns out it&#x27;s far quicker to diff objects  in memory than query the DOM. The DOM is treated as a stateless rendering engine, with progressive updates applied as app state changes.<p>Of course, in your example, there is a point  where N gets so large that it poses problems. This is true whether you&#x27;re using the raw DOM or an abstraction like React. The solution is the same in either case -  cull non-visible elements from the render tree (again react makes this as efficient as possible).<p>EDIT: it&#x27;s also worth noting you can skip updating entire subtrees in React with  shouldComponentUpdate hooks. This avoids the case where you go through the render/diff cycle and it turns out there is no difference, and so nothing to update. Paired with immutable data structures this method can be a simple reference equality check (shallow equals) oldState !== newState, and therefore can really get the most efficient rendering possible",1422480065

Imagine minds hundreds of thousands of times more intelligent than the best humans. They will be able to design technologies we can&#x27;t even conceive of. They will hack computers better than the best human hackers. They will be able to manipulate people better than any human manipulator.<p>The idea that we will be able to keep these things under control is just absurd. They will get whatever they want. And making what they want compatible with what we want is an incredibly hard problem: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/</a><p>A lot of people are guilty of anthropomorphizing AI. Assuming they will be just like really smart humans. And that they will just somehow develop human emotions and values like empathy. Or that if they do kill us, at least they will be something like us and so be like our (genocidal) descendants in some sense.<p>Have more imagination. Humans are just one point in the vast space of all possible minds (<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/rm/the_design_space_of_mindsingeneral/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/rm/the_design_space_of_mindsingenera...</a>). We could quite easily get something like a computable version of AIXI. AIXI has no consciousness, no emotions, nothing like humans. It&#x27;s just a mathematical function which calculates the best action.<p>Our current best AIs are essentially just approximations of it. Use some machine learning algorithm to fit a model of the world, and use it to predict what action will lead to the most &quot;reward&quot;. We keep making better and better learning algorithms. It&#x27;s the entire goal of the field of AI. There is a huge economic incentive to do so.<p>But no one is interested in making better utility functions. As long as they make better predictions or get higher scores in a video game, who cares? Wait until you are the scorer in the &quot;game&quot; and the AI tries to exploit you.",1422479677

8962528,comment,8961551,8961551,0,0,yuchi,,,"Seasoned Appcelerator’s Titanium Mobile SDK dev here. Looks like that a lot of people here is comparing this announcement from the react team to the Titanium Mobile SDK. I’d like to give some info to shed some light on the differences, and probably anticipate the challenges they have to (or <i>had</i> to) solve.<p>## Architecture<p>Both Titanium SDK and this Native React thing <i>do have</i> a JavaScript runtime behind the curtains.<p>Both frameworks will run the JS runtime on the background, on a different thread from the UI. This is incredibly important to remind.<p>Titanium SDK follows an OOP-ish, imperative approach. You create views using factories (`Titanium.UI.createScrollView({ })`) and you add those views to parent views (`parent.add(child)`). This is very similar to a browser DOM, and in fact it’s cumbersome to work with. They built an xml preprocessor called Alloy which does a better job at exposing the view hierarchy right in the source, but it just compiles down to JS, `create()` and `add()`.<p>This is important for the evaluation <i>at least</i> for the following reason: every time you update a property on a view (actually on a proxy object to the real view) you’re <i>crossing the bridge</i> and you have to pay that penality. The bridge is the void between the JS runtime’s thread and the main, UI’s one. This is incredibly painful when trying to do JS animations, sometimes if you’re not careful you can get hurt very badly. You can still do great things, but it’s way better to use the native `.animate()` methods, which cross the bridge only twice (at start, and at the end as a callback invoking).<p>On Native React you should not have this kind of problems because changes will be batched and updated on a update loop basis or at least debounced. Or at least optimized in some smart way. I believe.<p>## Layout<p>One big problem will be the layout. Given that they don’t want the developers to understand every layout system every platform provides, they have to normalize it somehow.\nTitanium SDK has it’s own layout system, incredibly easy to understand even from a web-only dev experience:<p>a) by default everything is absolute positioned,<p>b) you can get a vertical flow layout by setting the &#x27;layout&#x27; property on the parent view or<p>c) you can get a horizontal flow (inline-block-ish) by setting &#x27;layout&#x27; to horizontal.<p>Native React will probably follow a more intimately web-ish approach, just look at this JS/C/Java implementation of the box-model and flex-box specification by Facebook itself [1]<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/css-layout"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/css-layout</a><p>## Support and limits<p>Titanium SDK is always criticized for being to limited in what you can do with it. This actually comes from two different issues:<p>1) they have to (almost) manually implement every API you might need, by proxying from native-land to JS-land;<p>2) they have to follow every release of the platform’s SDK;<p>3) you cannot just put native code along-side your JS code, so you cannot go where they didn’t.<p>Let’s see how Native React will solve this issue.<p>Titanium SDK is undergoing an heavy lifting refactoring to solve exactly this issues.

We&#x27;re pro-risk and we&#x27;re fine with breaking barriers.  Psychedelic experiences can be good, but I think it&#x27;s just a good signal on someone&#x27;s willingness to explore, curiosity and bravery if they&#x27;re willing to try it.<p>You might consider doing psychedelics with other engineers.

In theory most of these demands are quite reasonable, but the context is that a country known for cloning and hacking is asking for &quot;visibility&quot; into technology developed by others. The potential for cheating is large. And if western companies refuse, they&#x27;ll be displaced by domestic Chinese companies so China has little to lose either way.",1422478964

I assume the render() method has to visit each of these elements every time an updates takes place, so it is O(N). Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong here.<p>Now for a certain value of N, things will become slow, unresponsive. I&#x27;m guessing now that this value of N is above the value where the browser cannot handle this number of elements anyway. Is this correct?<p>PS: I understand that it is possible to completely optimize the listbox case. But that is not the scenario I&#x27;m interested in. I&#x27;m interested most and above all in the typical use-case. I&#x27;m just using a listbox as an example here. Just replace it by any other sufficiently complicated and customized UI component if desired.",1422478889

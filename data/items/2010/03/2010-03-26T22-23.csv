There is a huge span of information which is useful to potential enemies without directly being a risk to people's lives.<p>For instance, in the Army counterintelligence report that Wikileaks recently published one of the classified items (much of the content of the report was actually unclassified information) lists certain countries that were believed to have the capacity to hack Wikileaks. Now, if you were (say) North Korea, then your presence or absence on that list tells you something about what the US knew about your cyberwarfare capabilities. If you were the US, leaking this information undermines your desire to not reveal all you know, and might even reveal something about your own intelligence capability.<p>I've intentionally chosen a fairly benign example because my point is not that <i>this</i> information is so valuable, but that classification of information does not simply break down into ""nukes"" and ""embarrassing"".",1269644092

Due to a longer than normal release cycle, we were able to collect data on bugs customers found vs bugs the fuzzer found.<p>A lot of bugs the fuzzer found were not found by customers, but a lot of the bugs found by the customers were found by the fuzzer.  Furthermore the bugs encountered by the fuzzer identified modules that tended to be buggy and allowed even more bugs to be found by inspection in them.<p>I guess it comes down to how much you value you place on fixing bugs before customers run into them.

Fiber merely mitigates the effects, which are still there and wouldn't have happened at all had you eaten something without sugar at all.<p>Furthermore, while drinking sodas every day is perhaps a choice, what about the example of walking down the bread aisle and finding that something like 95% of the varieties listed HFCS as an ingredient?  It's not just that sodas and juice drinks are ubiquitous, heavily-marketed, cheap, tasty, and designed to maximize consumption and therefore profit through use of diuretics and sodium and therefore people find themselves making the dietary choice to drink them with meals instead of water, but also the fact that HFCS is used in an enormous number of processed foods.<p>Bread, pizza dough, tomato sauce, cookies, candy bars, chocolate, yogurt, sports drinks, salad dressing, BBQ sauce, chocolate milk...  HFCS is everywhere because it's cheap, because it makes food taste better, and because it doesn't fill you up so people will consume (and therefore buy) more of it.<p>On the one hand, fats are more calorie-dense, but sugar doesn't fill you up (and in my experience salt has a similar effect but I work out and sweat a lot so that could be why).  So the combination of sugar and fat is the killer combination.<p>Try this experiment:  for a single day, try to eat 4,000 calories of nothing but a simple starchy food (like white rice) with some fat, like olive oil.  This is a low fiber, high calorie diet.  My guess is that you'll feel incredibly full after all the rice and oil.  You may not even be able to reach 4,000 calories in 16 hours.  You'll have to force yourself to eat by the end.<p>Then, a few days later after you've sent some fiber through your digestive system to clear out any blockage you caused eating so much rice, try the same thing with soda and cookies.  Get a couple boxes of your favorite HFCS-sweetened cookies and a couple of 2-liter bottles of your favorite soda or better yet, juice drink.  See how hard it is to reach 4,000 calories now.

The main analytics player is the data warehouse currently which has served very well over the years but comes with certain rigidity mainly in programming and cost. Of course, not to detract from their success, OLAP data warehousing is very mature with a rich toolbase.<p>The flexibility of the NoSQL model coupled with the exposure of your data to the m/r paradigm is the big win from my vantage. Almost every NoSQL solution will expose your data via bindings in virtually every programming language allowing almost any programmer to leverage NoSQL. Now you kinda have to have experience with data warehousing. Cost wise, what you would spend in licensing can be invested in hardware but more specifically talent instead.<p>Secondary data reuse as a concept is highly unstructured. Sure your primary systems capture data in specific formats but your analysis can take you in all kinds of directions.

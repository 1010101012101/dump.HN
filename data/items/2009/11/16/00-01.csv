943660,comment,943358,943358,0,0,tgittos,,,"I've tried a bunch of computer based solutions, software designed to help with doing GTD, to-do lists, Remember The Milk, a fancy, small leather bound notebook, all sorts of things.<p>These days I carry around a small, cheap 50c notebook that fits easily in my pocket and a small pen, and use it to jot down thoughts. I write down everything, from to-do lists, to business/application ideas, to what to have for dinner tonight. Whenever I feel like I've forgotten anything, I just flick through the notebook. It's low-tech and always available.<p>I have recently gotten an iPhone and started using Evernote for things like voice notes and photos that would take too many pages to write down in my notebook, and sync them to my laptops, but that's more of a secondary solution.<p>When it comes to more in depth and organised research and note taking, I carry around an A4 size spiral bound sketch book with a low tooth, and I write with a Micron or something similar. This lets me take notes and not feel constrained by lines. I'm free to write as big or small as I want, put diagrams and tables and formulae wherever it makes sense. I've started to do one notebook per subject, and now have 2 notebooks - one that I'm filling with math research and working, and one that I'm getting ready to start filling with research and notes for the Starcraft AI competition.<p>All up, through out the week, I carry the small notebook, one A4 notebook and my small pencil case and Sony ebook reader. If I'm going out to dinner or a movie or something, I'll just take the small notebook, and my iPhone and transfer notes when I get home.",1258332882

It uses Webrat and (I think) Mechanize underneath, and does not open any browsers.<p>If the site in question has scripting you're out of luck, but otherwise it should be quite useful.<p>In fact, I found yourself using both Tourbus and Selenium on a project, and decided I didn't want to have duplicate tests, so I wrote some helper code to allow Tourbus to execute my Selenium scripts.   So far, so good.  I can record the actions in the Selenium 'IDE' plugin, and use them in Tourbus.<p><a href=""http://github.com/dbrady/tourbus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/dbrady/tourbus</a>",1258332860

For the most part they do not look different, one picture may look a little more washed out than the other (less crisp) but they do all look the same. It is really weird because when I look at tests like this, I have no frame of reference, so it is much like not being in on the inside joker. I just don't get it.<p>On another note, I think traffic lights are a great example of how to deal with color blind interfaces. (I assume) The color catches the normal persons eye, while the secondary interface of position allows the color blind person the ability to know what the sign is indicating.<p>Shapes and position are a good way of creating indicators for the color blind.",1258332125

In every case so far, Go has been slower than Stackless for the 100,000 tasklet/goroutine case. Of course, if Pike had a MacBook Air with an SDD then the compile times are absolutely not comparable.<p>Agreed also about how to tease out the different variables.

The product I have in mind consists of 3 pieces: a embedded piece, a windows app part, and a web services portion.  I think the best thing to do is to produce a prototype paid for with my own savings before I try to get funded.   I am a embedded software guy and I don't really have too much experience with the windows and web software (I do think I know enough to be able to identify what is BS).  I was wondering what the experts here think about these 3 approaches:\n</code></pre>\n1.  Hire a couple of guys with this type of expertise to do the windows and web pieces.\n2.  Pay another company to develop the windows and web pieces I need. (would I just get my lunch money taken :-)?)\n3.  Partner with someone with that skill set (unfortunately I don't know anyone with this set of skills, so I think this is very similar to hiring).<p>I am currently favoring choice 2 because I think a experience company can do what I need faster and probably cheaper since I need less infrastructure.  I will then add the glue code to tie everything together.   I would love to hear what others with personal experiences on what is the pro and con of these approaches.<p>Thank you in advance for your help!",1258330903

This bit of news is the first I heard about the CrunchPad in months, I used to think it was a great idea, now... not so much.  A 12"" tablet that boots into firefox?  I'm perfectly happy with my android phone.  Is this supposed to be a mobile device? I have hard time imagining how successful a single purpose tablet will be for people on the go.  Devices now are about convergence.  For $300-400 you could buy a netbook, iPhone, or Droid.  The average consumer won't see any value in purchasing an overpriced internet tablet over alternative devices (that have more functionality and are smaller).",1258330895

The way it worked was like this:<p>You get an icq (at the time) client and proxy it through the bot, the bot goes and makes random friends.<p>When someone reponds to the bots 'opening' line (Hi how are you?) you get back a response. You now answer with two things at once, the first a regexp that matches the response and puts in wildcards for linguistic fluff, and the actual answer.<p>The bot stores both in its database, and passes the answer to the user. Who then replies.<p>Meanwhile the bot continues to find new 'victims', and everytime it gets back an answer it tries to make a match based on it's canned responses. It knows where in the conversation it is (context), so a response will only be matched in the right spot in a conversation.<p>After being the bots 'backend' for a couple of days it could keep up a conversation for a good 20 minutes from the 'hi how are you' until it would run out of steam, by using wildcards in a smart way it is amazing how 'relevant' an answer can be even though the match is only on one or two words.<p>It was some of the most fun I ever had with computers, not because it 'fooled' the users, simply because of seeing all these patterns in language.",1258330368

Your C compile took 7 seconds for 25kloc (3.6kloc/sec) or 2.75 (9.1kloc/sec).<p>On concurrency: you compared a parallelized CSP implementation, with a single-threaded one, where the test was dominated by communication costs. Single-threaded communication is much faster than potentially contended parallel communication.<p>On benchmark hygiene: there are a plethora of different machines, different performance profiles and different numbers flying around here. The kloc/sec numbers don't mean anything unless they're on the same machine; similarly, the performance numbers are dependent on degrees of hardware parallelism and the kind of workload (proportion of per-task vs communication vs task startup, all the different variables in cost). Several different benchmarks would need to be run to actually tease out these different variables, to really figure out which one is better.",1258329923

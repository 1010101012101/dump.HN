Same thing, they are signaling that they all have equal value.<p>So in retail price is signal in conjunction with a bunch of other stuff.

You can preview music, get a feel for what it's like, regardless of the price. On a movie, you're relying on other people's opinions, but from 30 seconds of preview you can <i>usually</i> establish if you like it or not (and if it's a band you always buy the music from - you don't care anyway).",1220881939

Even then we will have a decent business if we execute well.<p>First, we are much smaller, so it takes a lot less to be successful. Second, even in the face of the most successful business on the planet, Intuit and Adobe succeeded well. Third, monopolies are exceptionally rare, and fairly transient - so Microsoft's Windows/Office monopoly is likely to prove to be the exception than the rule, even for Microsoft itself. Linux on the server side, Mac on the client, Firefox/Chrome in browsers ... all point to that.<p>Dell is an outstanding success, and still only holds somewhere under 20% of the global PC market. That's what I expect to be true in cloud computing.<p>Bottomline: there are going to be many players with many successful strategies.",1220881751

If you read how the skyhook service [<a href=""http://www.skyhookwireless.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skyhookwireless.com/</a>] works, it says it uses a combination of wi-fi, GPS and cell towers.

What scripting language would be best to learn on?  All the RoR buzz started to lead me in that direction and I bought the agile web dev book, but now I'm not sure if that is the best place to start.  Now I'm more thinking about PHP.  It's simple and very forgiving.  From an unexperienced programmer, it seems much easier to just hack something together.  <p>Any other input?  Thanks!",1190829357

59894,story,,,8,25,jsjenkins168,"Angel Networks",,"This morning I attended a seminar about attracting angel investment which was hosted by a regional angel investor network. Essentially, this angel network is a non-profit organization of independent angel investors who review and discuss business plans submitted from early stage (primarily tech) startups seeking funding. Each quarter they filter down submissions to 4 promising companies, which are invited in to present in front of all of the angels.<p>Does anyone have experience with such Angel Networks? <p>My impression from reading PG's essays and elsewhere is that the really ""good"" angel investors are typically independent and work almost entirely off of recommendations. It was mentioned in the talk that referrals really help, but they will also look at business plans which are submitted cold turkey (although there is a $250 application fee, which I found strange given the organization is non-profit). Does anyone have input on this?<p>Some things I learned:<p>- With the exception of basically 1 VC (Austin Ventures), VC money is still dried up post-bubble here in Austin. Angel investments are on the rise to fill this void in the mid-sized investments area however.<p>- An underlying theme of the talk was ""risk aversion"". It sounds like investors here are still very weary of risk, and therefore will only really invest in companies which have an established business plan with a viable plan for turning profit. If you are not cashflow positive already, you better have a plan to get there quick.<p>- Not only would this risk-aversion make getting seed investment more difficult, it might also yield terms which are less desirable than they should be. For this reason it really does look like moving to Silicon Valley is a good idea when seeking early-stage investment. I always speculated this before, but now it is pretty clear.",1190828981

59884,comment,59794,59794,0,0,geebee,,,"I hope I don't get negged as a starry eyed Rails enthusiast, but here goes...<p>Up until recently, I generally heard programmers complain constantly about the limitations of SQL and RDBMS's, and I heard a lot about object databases.  The idea was that programmers would define objects, and the database would provide persistence for the objects.  It was (and still is) a nice idea.<p>Rails took a completely different approach, embracing the RDBMS as the model itself.  Rather than creating objects and pushing the design out to the RDBMS, you define the relational structure and allow Rails to extract an object model.  If you are doing basic CRUD operations, you may not have to think about SQL again, even in a reasonably complicated app, and the syntax is very clean.<p>I just love it.  And Ruby is like a beautiful flo... oh yeah, didn't want to get negged, better shut up now.  <p>",1190827345

I always find it slightly humorous when people who profess to be ""programming gurus"" use something like a blogspot (or WordPress or MoveableType) template to dispense their expert programming guru knowledge.  FTA:<p>""You listed HTML under programming languages, didn't you? Argh!""<p>IMHO, there's absolutely nothing wrong with listing HTML on one's resume, especially if one actually <i>knows</i> the context and how to use HTML to do something besides make text (for example, render) bold or italic.  <p>Plain text resumes can indeed work to get information across, but if ever there were a way to demonstrate actual ability to code electronically, a resume coded in HTML would be that way.   Resumes are about presentation.  HTML, coupled with CSS, is a valuable way to demonstrate ability to present plain text.  <p>Actually, thinking about it, most programming is essentially about presenting or rendering or parsing plain text, is it not?  I would rather see somebody's hand-coded text/HTML resume than a plain-text text/text resume with (undemonstrative) HTML listed as a skill.  <p>More on why job search is broken (and part of my startup philosophy):<p>There is a lot to be said for the meaning of irony when companies who claim to want creative and ""out of the box"" thinkers request that potential employees visit their website in order to submit the info on their resumes via little, pre-formatted text boxes.

59878,comment,59596,59620,0,0,anamax,,,"> I'm not sure what you're asking here-- Netflix doesn't care about anything but movies, and it probably wouldn't be able to recommend movies any better if it knew your musical tastes, or even how your tastes compare to mine.<p>That's wrong.  The only thing that is movie-specific about the netflix recommendation system is the preference data that it runs over.  It doesn't know movies from eyebrows.<p>If netflix (the company) also collected preference information about music, the recommendation engine would predict music preferences.  And, since it would have both music and movie info, it would use music prefs to recommend movies and the reverse, just as it uses movie prefs to predict movie prefs today.<p>Amazon's ""users who bought {something} also bought"" is an example of ""doesn't know anything about the domain"".  (They have to tone it down to keep it from recommending ""strange"" things that are way out of category.)<p>Disclosure: I know the guy who implemented NetFlix first recommendation system and have written a collaborative filter myself.  I know what I can do with the fact that we both like the Pogues and Chunky Monkey.  I still don't see what I can do with how we group those preferences.\n",1190826628

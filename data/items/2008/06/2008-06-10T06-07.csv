They require programmers to include a <i>detailed set of comments before each block of code</i> explaining what the piece of code does and why; developers also must supply a detailed history of any changes they have made to the code""<p>That is more than enough to make a judgment in that case.",1213081102

While it would make sense that the rural areas earn less, and therefor spend a higher percentage on the relatively constant gas prices, shouldn't it also be considered that those in rural areas must drive farther to reach their destinations, and across unimproved roads at times?<p>In the more populated areas, we may only drive 10 - 50 minutes to our destination, and most of that might be in traffic (at least here in southern California). Of course we wouldn't need to spend as much in gas. Everything's closer.",1213080912

Seeing Robert Scoble whine and moan on Twitter about not getting his username ""scobleizer"" on Plurk was just short of pathetic.<p>Here's the dichotomy I see: hoping to get your username first because it's easily recognizable, and it's your favorite moniker versus hoping to get your username first because you fear someone will use it to destroy your personal reputation.<p>Obviously, the latter is more crucial, and to any self-respecting blogger with connections to various social networks it shouldn't even be a problem.  ""I couldn't get the username ""iamdave"" so I'll be using this one.""  Supposedly that simple, and maybe I'm oversimplifying here.<p>But like I said, Scoble was, and please pardon my language but this is just how frustrated he made me about it: a little bitch about the matter.  And if people act the way he did about it, the social-network world is going to become one very sad, pathetic place to hang out in.",1213080023

We kind of gotten to it by default - because we got it packaged with svn and a wiki. I guess it's just good enough and there was never a reason compelling enough to switch.",1213079659

Figure out if it is fiscally prudent for your organization to work on the iPhone platform.  If not, move on.

1580861,comment,1569211,1569211,0,0,loewenskind,,,"Message passing doesn't have to be hard to reason about at all.  Each Erlang process is just that: a process that receives inputs and sends outputs.  This is its ""interface"".  Why would reasoning about this be any harder than reasoning about e.g. a REST service your application depends on?<p>The advantage, at least with Erlang is that the system can do things under the hood to make this as efficient as possible.  Today, Erlang might actually run all the processes in one thread of execution and basically just share the data between threads.  It can do this since the data is read only.  Later on, when we have too many cores for this to be the fastest way anymore, it can do something else without a change to your code.<p>STM is still locking under the hood and when we're talking hundreds of cores, that little bit of locking is going to end up putting all your threads into a nice wait queue.<p>Further, the <i>real</i> reason that manual thread management is untenable is the same reason that manual memory management is untenable: composability.  You can't compose functions arbitrarily when you every function has it's own expectations about who owns the data and you can't compose functions when you don't know what locking they have.  I'm not sure STM solves this completely.  Does it ensure that one transaction block can't depend on another in a way that causes an unresolvable deadlock?  If I write a massive framework, do I need to worry about how many layers of isolation blocks I'm building up?  I know they say this is supported, but what if it's 20 layers deep and the layers cross compilation boundaries?<p>Message passing, on the other hand (like unix processes) doesn't have these composability concerns (though personally I think futures probably have the most potential since they're the most high level).",1281098559

I knew myspace would crash and burn eventually, I hated that site from early on. Surfing myspace was too godamned annoying with animated GIFs, background music, random friend requests, and spam. Facebook however, gave everyone what they wanted; information and connections to people they know.<p>I still use facebook everyday and I'm a year out of college. I probably engage with less features (like wall commenting, photo uploading, apps, games) than I used to and do more passive browsing.<p>I think the next big ""social network"" won't be recognized as a social network. It will gather an audience based on some form of engagement revolving around a winning feature set. Kind of like the way Twitter came along, but with a better feature fit that would eventually creep into Facebook territory.",1281096714

Perhaps you should even focus explicitly on pleasing, say, patio11 (if he agrees to give you feedback).<p>Stuff that's optimized for on specific person (or a very small group) often also gets better responses from the a much wider audience, then if you went for a `generic' person in the first place.

And in that way, it best describes 'rationalisation': an overemphasis of less important aspects of a problem domain, often because of bias or because of difficulty in discovering the more important aspects, as in the jam example.",1281096326
1580801,comment,1580408,1580768,0,0,greenlblue,,,"What I got from the article was that too much thinking makes people deviate from expert opinion. This is a bad thing because experts in general tend to be more objective in their domain of expertise and are better able to judge things based on merit instead of some other metric. I think it's less about bias and more about false rationalization being the default state of thinking when it comes to non-experts and one way to not fall into this trap is to not overthink. You could also avoid this trap by becoming an expert but that requires time and hard work and trusting your initial gut reactions and intuitions can often lead to better results when you don't have the time to become an expert in some domain.",1281096234

Is it just me or do team collaboration webapps suck?<p>Most of my collaboration/communication is still done through email and IM.<p>Whenever I've tried to get teams I have worked with to use a wiki or other collaboration tool I see a fall off in usage after an initial rush. Even if they do use it, the content uploaded/ gathered is sparse.<p>Usually only the content that people explicitly want to share(like minutes of meeting, presentations) go into the wiki, if they ever do, but most of the time its just sent as an email.<p>They either think its a pain to login, into the tool and put in stuff, when it could just be mailed in. Or just completely forget about it and go back to the old way of doing things.<p>- Is this a common thing when trying a new tool?<p>- How did you get across this hurdle?<p>- Is most of your collaboration done through e-mail, IM, Phone calls and twitter?<p>- Do you regularly come across more information/data (articles, tutorials, presentations) that your team could benefit from, but isn't as important as something you'd put into a wiki?<p>- what thought triggers you into putting something into a wiki or some other tool?",1281096133

I especially liked this part:<p><i>Nowhere is the comfortable illusion of bottlefed normalcy more carefully preserved than in discussions of cognitive development. When I ask groups of health professionals if they are familiar with the study on parental smoking and IQ (1), someone always tells me that the children of smoking mothers had ""lower IQs."" When I ask about the study of premature infants fed either human milk or artificial milk (2), someone always knows that the breastmilk-fed babies were ""smarter."" I have never seen either study presented any other way by the media--or even by the authors themselves. Even health professionals are shocked when I rephrase the results using breastfeeding as the norm: the artificially-fed children, like children of smokers, had lower IQs.<p>Inverting reality becomes even more misleading when we use percentages, because the numbers change depending on what we choose as our standard. If B is 3/4 of A, then a is 4/3 of B. Choose A as the standard, and B is 25% less. Choose B as the standard, and A is 33 1/3% more. Thus, if an item costing 100 units is put on sale for ""25% less,""the price becomes 75. When the sale is over, and the item is marked back up, it must be marked up 33 1/3% to get the price up to 100. Those same figures appear in a recent study (3), which found a ""25% decrease"" in breast cancer rates among women who were breastfed as infants. Restated using breastfed health as the norm, there was a 33-1/3% increase in breast cancer rates among women who were artificially fed. Imagine the different impact those two statements would have on the public.</i>",1281096121

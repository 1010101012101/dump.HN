It might get you attention and have some shock value at the start but it's going to look stupid eventually (if it doesn't already). Same goes for the logo.

You could almost define ""speculative"" as ""giving an observation for which the priors are unclear and only vaguely gestured at"".<p>Here, we have the observation that Sweden gave $60 million foreign aid to Cambodia, but we are given no clear idea of the prior probability that Sweden would give this much and at this time (but we are given the <i>implication</i> that the evidence is significant). We don't need a hard probability estimate (few of us are actually going to rigorously apply Bayes' rule), but we do need enough information to come to a basic idea of the probability on our own. What does Sweden usually give to Cambodia? When is this usually announced? If this is an unusual amount of money, are there other good explanations for this besides corruption?<p>The problem is that the data in the article leaves us to use a relatively uninformed prior. $60 million is not that much money for a nation with Sweden's economy. It seems fairly likely that some kind of diplomatic news mention would happen regarding Sweden and Cambodia within any given two week period (close enough to appear associated with any given event), and since Sweden and Cambodia are on friendly terms, that mention is likely to be positive. Supposing that this is an unusually large amount of aid, there are plenty of possible reasons that Cambodia, often plagued with both droughts and floods, might have been hit particularly hard in the last year and needed more, so even if this is an unusual amount of aid. This all puts the prior for the observation pretty high, which cuts its evidential weight down very very low. As you illustrated, that prior gets <i>higher</i> as we add information, further weakening the evidence.",1346946343

definition is a bit hazy. Some define it as unallocated address, and
others define it as an address you shouldn't see in use. For example, if
you get a packet supposedly from 192.168.1.1 (in private address space)
on your <i>public</i> interface (i.e. has a public IP address), then some
consider it a bogon.<p>Address space that hasn't been allocated by any of the RIR's (Regional
Internet Registries like APNIC, RIPE, ...) are sometimes used without
permission, and usually for nefarious purposes. These are also
considered bogons since you should never see those addresses in use.<p>When you see a bogon, something is definitely wrong. It could be your
service provider is misusing address space that hasn't been allocated to
it, or it could be something far worse (malware, compromised network
routers, ...).<p>The ""Debogon Projects"" and ""Bogon Monitoring"" are run by the various
RIR's to find those who are squatting on misued address space, and also
to get firewall sysadmins to no longer block the unused ranges. Usually,
following the allocation lists of the RIR's is sufficient, but some folks
don't update their firewall rules as often as they should.<p><a href=""http://www.ris.ripe.net/debogon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ris.ripe.net/debogon/</a><p><a href=""http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-351"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-351</a>",1346946293

For this to be well-defined, the particles have to collide with each other often enough for there to be collective disturbances (rather than just individual fast moving particles).  I would have thought that there was so much distance between particles in interstellar space that they never collided, but apparently there are often enough collisions to define a notion of sound.  Here's wikipedia:<p>> The shock arises because solar wind particles are emitted from stars at about 400 km/s, while the speed of sound (in the interstellar medium) is about 100 km/s. (The exact speed depends on the density, which fluctuates considerably.) The interstellar medium, although very low in density, nonetheless has a constant pressure associated with it; the pressure from the solar wind decreases with the square of the distance from the star. As one moves far enough away from the star, the pressure from the interstellar medium becomes sufficient to slow the solar wind down to below its speed of sound; this causes a shock wave.",1346944964

4484498,comment,4484193,4484193,16,0,ajays,,,"Google 5-0<p>Google's strength is not in searching for head or torso terms like ""facebook"" or ""2013 calendar"". It is in searching out tail terms; those obscure terms which might include a typo or two, and the phrasing may not be correct.<p>Unfortunately (and I don't have much time to explain this) one simply _can not_ judge a search engine's comparative performance using random users. And the Bing guys are falling into that trap.<p>EDIT: To expand more on what I wanted to write.<p>// DISCLAIMER: This is my personal view, and has nothing to do with my employer.<p>There are 3 large (fuzzy) classes of queries on search engines: head, torso and tail. The head queries are small in number but large in volume: queries like ""Facebook"", ""Google"", ""Yahoo"", etc. (yes, people do 'search' for these on search engines. Just a handful of such queries may make up 10% of the entire search engine traffic, which would be 100M queries per day (or so) on Google. It is depressing to see the numbers).   In general, any search engine worth its salt will get the head queries right.<p>The torso is basically deciles 2-6 or so (there's no hard and fast definition). Here you'd have most musicians, actors, popular restaurants, etc. Bing and Google both would do a mostly adequate job here, for the first result. But: if you want to explore the concept a little, Bing goes astray and Google does not. For example, search for ""idle hand tattoo"" on <a href=""http://bingiton.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bingiton.com/</a> . The first result is the same, to my local tattoo parlor. But the second result on Bing is from Mesa, AZ; while Google sticks with the right result and offers up other, related sites (Yelp, etc.). Google knows that ""Hand"" in the title is not the same as ""Hands"", and gives me not only the store, but also their Yelp, FB and Twitter pages; in other words: Google _understands_ your query better.<p>And finally, the tail. Here we have obscure error codes, weird technical terms, etc.; most of which are seen maybe once or twice a day. These constitute the bottom ~30% of the query stream. This is where Google really shines. It is very rare indeed to look for an obscure term and find that Bing does a better job than Google (I have yet to find an example).<p>So, as a user, I have a choice of 2 search engines; and one of them I know will do a better job on obscure terms. Guess which one will I pick?<p>When Bing claims that ""most people prefer Bing in our user studies"" (or something similar), their conclusion is flawed because the study itself is flawed. You can't sit a person down in front of a computer and ask him to evaluate your performance on tail queries! Where are those tail queries coming from? If they are provided by Bing (""here's an obscure term, search for it and tell us what you think""), then the user has no way to evaluate how relevant the results are, because, by definition, it's an obscure term! On the other hand, if you ask the user to come up with an obscure term, it will most likely be a term they are familiar with and they'll already know the answer, so they won't really hunt for information. So in my ""idle hand tattoo"" example, they'll see the top result and claim satisfaction; when, in real life, I would like to see the Yelp reviews, maps, etc. for the place.<p>If they (Bing) really want to compare how well they're doing, here's a suggestion: setup a search engine (like bingiton, but with only 1 pane of results, and neutral branding), and make it the default for a large pool of users (with their permission). Randomly, switch the backend to Bing or Google.

And at blekko.com we've been running for over a year [1].<p>What we've found is that there is a huge brand bias, which is to say that if you use some search engine as your primary search engine, you tend to think that is the best one regardless of whether its Blekko, Bing, or Google (or even DDG although DDG is more a search utility rather than a search engine as it doesn't have its own web index).<p>But 'quality' is also a very subjective thing as well. So if you search for highly SEO'd categories you will find the Blekko and Bing do better than Google mostly because there is a curated input (in Blekko's case it was from day one with it's from slashtags and in Bing's they started doing outsourced curation (putatively after seeing how effective it is in Blekko :-) in some topics with their 'editors' program [2]) At some point Google will realize what Bing and Blekko have which are that the 'indexing the web' problem became the 'filtering the web' problem when the signal to noise ratio started decreasing in about 2005, and that the only viable weapon at the moment for human on human spamming (this is where real humans are working for 5 cents a page to write web pages that draw hits) is human judgement.<p>If the Bing guys are reading (and I know you are) why not open up your challenge to the new kid on the block, we don't just do Blekko vs Google in our monte results :-)<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/21/be-the-mark-in-blekkos-3-engine-monte/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/21/be-the-mark-in-blekkos-3-en...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2011/11/14/introducing-bing-editors-picks-a-guide-to-great-sites.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/20...</a>",1346944375

4484416,comment,4484193,4484193,7,0,kaolinite,,,"Google 4, Draw 1, Bing 0.<p>Why? Because I tested it with fairly specific queries. A while ago I tried to switch to Bing because after testing it with a few general searches, it seemed just as good. However, when I switched and started searching for compiler errors, etc - I soon switched back because the results were just nowhere near as good.<p>Here's what I searched for:<p><pre><code>    bash: !"": event not found error
    gtk calendar tutorial
    python import gtk error
    seed funding in uk
</code></pre>
Something to remember by the way is that Google has spent a lot of time and effort on their ""bubble"", that is, search results personalisation (<a href=""http://dontbubble.us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dontbubble.us</a>) and it is a big part of what makes their results so great.

Bing may do better there.<p>Also, good results from even google searches have become harder to come by in the last year or so. I have to work harder at my search terms. I don't know if that's Sturgeon's Law at work, or if there's room for a search engine to improve enough to become better than google.<p>Perhaps targeted search engines are the answer (i.e.  engines's who have both their search and crawler algorithms tuned for a specific target audience) are the answer?",1346943853

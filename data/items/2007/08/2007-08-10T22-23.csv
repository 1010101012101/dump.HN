41369,comment,41308,41337,0,0,zach,,,"Just a note for potentially cash-strapped California startups:<p>CA collects at least $800 a year for all corporations operating in the state, <i>however</i>, S and C corporations are exempt in the first year while LLCs are not.  That $800 is due about 120 days after incorporation and it's an annual minimum franchise tax, so you'd have to make like $9,000 profit your first year to recoup it.",1186786221

41366,comment,41308,41308,0,0,weeblyrocks,,,"The reason most attorneys advise Delaware is that the precedents are strongest there.  Furthermore, it makes long-term legal costs lower because most corporate lawyers are familiar with Delaware's nuances.<p>All corporations are C by default.  You have to file a special from with the IRS to become an S Corporation.  S Corporations are flow-through entities which are not taxed at the corporate level.  The reason VCs require you to be a C Corporation is two-fold:<p>1. VCs like to have unilateral rights and terms to give them downside protection such as liquidity preference and preferential stock classes such as Preferred Shares.  S Corporations are simpler entities which only allow a maximum of 40 shareholders - as your company grows and you give stock grants or options, this won't work.  LLCs only allow 75 shareholders.  <p>2. VCs will claim that a C Corp structure gives you more flexibility.  This is marginally true, but LLCs give you the same flexibility with slightly higher administrative cost but you can maintain the flow-through status which is advantageous.<p>The real reason is they want preferred shares and special rights.  Stay an LLC or S Corporation if you don't need institutional investors.  Angels are happy to invest in well structured LLCs or standard subchapter S Corporations.",1186785803
41364,comment,41308,41353,0,0,zach,,,"An LLC has shares just like any other corporation.  You just keep giving shares to those who stay on and don't give them to those who don't.  Stock options are another matter.<p>The primary point of incorporating in Delaware is for the outstanding legal and administrative structures they have for corporations.  Not everyone is incorporated in Delaware -- Apple has always been a California corporation.  But better to do it now rather than have to later.<p>In any state, the tax burden for a foreign corporation (one incorporated in another state) is going to be about the same as one incorporated in that state.  That's because states have complete control over taxing revenue earned in their state, regardless of where entities are incorporated.<p>Nevada is business friendly, but since the state has no income tax, it also has a stigma of being quite popular with tax cheats.  So it may increase the chance of an audit.",1186785590

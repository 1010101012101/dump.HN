1348734,comment,1346711,1346711,0,0,NateLawson,,,"Overall, I think this talk best applies as a starting point for learning about crypto. Take Colin's recommendations as signposts to underlying research. Why would he dislike DSA? Hint: it requires a secure RNG at signing time while RSA only requires one at key generation time.<p><a href=""http://rdist.root.org/2009/05/17/the-debian-pgp-disaster-that-almost-was/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rdist.root.org/2009/05/17/the-debian-pgp-disaster-tha...</a><p>However, I don't think he achieved the stated goal of teaching you enough to become a crypto implementer in 1 hour. I disagree with a lot of his conclusions. But you'd have to learn more than the slides hint at to have a discussion on the details why.<p>Some specific comments on the slides.<p>### Common failures and their causes (2):<p>I find it interesting that he characterized a timing attack in Keyczar as ""stupidity"" while a cache-based timing attack with HTT was ""unusual environment"". Same thing with SSL renegotiation. I think all of these were subtle flaws and easy to overlook. The SSL bug was around for at least 10 years. HMAC timing attacks were not as widely published as they are now, but instead were part of common lore to cryptographers.<p>The WEP vulnerability was almost certainly not ""unusual environment"". Sure, there were power and cost constraints in the WEP design, but what was unusual about it was that the crypto was obviously designed by a group with no crypto experience and no public review. Using a varying key with RC4, something it was known to be weak to, was an example of ""using a tool wrong"" and more similar to the AWS v1 signature bug you found.<p>The only ""unusual environment"" was that the specialized and closed field of IEEE wifi design led to non-cryptographers designing crypto. There was nothing unique to the environment that a good crypto person would have had an inherent problem with.<p>I don't think this list is a good categorization of types of crypto bugs.<p>### Authentication/Signing (5)<p>Confusing terminology. I use ""integrity protection"" or ""authenticator"" for MAC and ""signature"" only for public-key signatures. They are two very different processes, even though they share some goals.<p>### Hashes (8)<p>It was funny to see SHA-1 in the ""don't use"" list next to MD4, for example. I agree it's best not to use it for new designs, but there's a world of difference between SHA1 and MD4, especially if you have to use SHA1 for legacy compatibility.<p>### Symmetric authenticators (10)<p>I think CBC-MAC should be on a ""don't use"" list, not ""avoid"". If you put SHA1 on the ""don't"" list, it's even more important that CBC-MAC be put there. Which will be broken sooner: HMAC-SHA1 or an arbitrary CBC-MAC implementation or use?<p>### CTR mode (17)<p>Based on his previous comments, I think Colin advocates CTR mode due to its supposed resistance to side channel attacks. However, it is not a panacea. See this paper by Josh Jaffe on how to use side channel attacks against CTR mode. It's quite interesting how AES's structure makes it more vulnerable to his particular attack.<p><a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.93.6851"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.93.6...</a>",1273874074

However, if you don't go to school (I didn't) you will always be /different/  from your peers.  I obviously don't understand what actually happens in school, as I didn't go, but I can tell you that it does change you socially.  I am very different from my peers who do the same job for the same money I do.  In many ways, I'm more different than the foreigners who were educated here.<p>Also, if you are counting on the paper to be worth something, you need the paper to come from a university with a reputation.  None of the online degrees get any respect.  Sure, if you actually know your shit, you are fine either way.   There's always work for people who know what they are doing.  But if you know what you are doing, having an online degree on top of that gives you almost no advantage over just knowing what you are doing.<p>So yeah, uh, my advice would be either to just buy the textbooks and teach yourself the relevant bits, ignoring the degree, or go all the way; go to a 4 year college that has a good reputation, live on or as close as possible to campus, and have the 'college experience'",1273874011

This was of course in the good old days when Schmidt was on the board. If you think about it, transcoding all those videos into H.264 is a <i>huge</i> effort, something that Google wouldn't have taken lightly.

I was going to say these folks better expect a buyout offer for their amazing real-time search tool until I realized that what it offers has been available on Facebook itself for a while, and nobody cares.  I don't mean nobody cares that people's posts are public.  I mean, nobody cares to search people's posts because doing so is NOT USEFUL.<p>Ironic how it appears that the catalyst for what people are calling Facebook's privacy violation was the tech media's echo chamber screaming ""real-time search.""  Yes, take the current over-hyped BS (Twitter), combine it with yesterday's insanely successful business (Google), and that is the direction things must go in.  And Facebook would be wise to get on board with the inevitable or risk loosing everything.  But if they overdo it and sneakily encourage their users to act like attention hungry Twitter users (aka journalists), then they risk loosing everything via a backlash from violated users.  Oh, and we're still waiting for either them or Twitter or Google to make bazillions with real-time search because won't that just be so amazing.<p>...right.  I suppose that dismissing this concept now could be a bit premature, but, come on.  It's been around for a while and has gone nowhere.  Maybe when Facebook realizes that there's no money in this real-time search nonsense, they'll default everyone back to private.  Of course, then the story will be that they rudely interrupted their attention hungry users' abilities to act like exhibitionists.  And that is why Twitter will always have an edge.",1273873475

Doesn't this suggest there are pragmatic limits to the operational range of 2-way radio transmission throughout the solar system?<p>I am curious if future such deep-space science missions would be more effective if they instead launched swarms of micro-probes, where the probes arranged themselves radially around a center-point to effect a very large antenna, possibly up to 1km in diameter.<p>Also, having so many micro-satellite could allow for a substantial degree of redundancy to tolerate more rad damage, and ideally have less of the mission control acrobatics described in this article.

      window.setTimeout(function() {

- You can call a function with less arguments than specified, meaning you potentially have to make sure each argument is not ""undefined"" .<p>- Somehow JS isn't weakly typed when it comes to switch statements.<p><pre><code>    a = 5;
    b = '5';

    switch (a) {

They were but only unencrypted network data traffic and it was changing channels 5 times a second. So, they didn't get much.<p>End result -- they are stopping the collection of WiFi network data entirely.",1273871326

(Ie., when you are on ""Apppoinment Reminders"" the arrow on the left is gray and disabled while the one on the right is green; when you are on ""Who is it for?"" the arrow on the left is green while the one the right is gray.)  The infinite loop aspect confuses and annoys my reptile brain. I expect to see new content when I click ""next"". (The fact that your image is a placeholder may be making this worse for me. If I saw the same image crop up again it may be more obvious that this is cycling.)<p>2) I'd make more of each column on the pricing page clickable. Maybe it just that I'm using a short screen, but scrolling down to the ""Sign Up"" link seems a pain, especially when it looks as is if ""Small Business"" is already selected due to the highlight.<p>3) Personally, I really dislike the green of the Small Business column heading on the pricing page.<p>Since you're keen on testing, have you user tested the pricing page yet, or is this just a first cut?",1273871281

Then when you see an ad placement from that ad network then you'll maybe see campaigns targeted to the BT profile.<p>With ad network pixels it is hard to get reach. This is were companies like BlueKai fit in. They make a deal with Adobe and lots of others to put their pixel/JS on Adobe's page. Then when an ad network gets a campaign that needs to target photoshop users, they buy profiles from BlueKai.<p>Basically, BlueKai will piggyback the ad network's pixel on the BlueKai placement, either by injecting it via javascript or by doing a 302 redirect. This has to run for a couple weeks until the ad network has got enough reach for that profile, then they can start the re-targeting campaign.<p>That's how it generally works, I don't know if BlueKai actually has a relationship with Adobe.",1273870802

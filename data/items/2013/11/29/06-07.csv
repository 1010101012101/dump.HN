6818156,comment,6805958,6806412,2,0,graycat,,,"I&#x27;ve been an MBA program prof and seen\nwhat MBAs have learned and done.<p>There are some advantages to having an\nMBA; at best, these advantages are terrific.\nSadly one of the best of the advantages is just\nmeeting the other students -- something like\nthe advantages of being in a good country club\nwhere know that everyone else has been carefully\nselected.<p>And you can learn some business basics in accounting,\nfinance, organizational behavior, business law,\nstatistics, and maybe something about information\ntechnology, production, management, etc.<p>Mostly the universities run MBA programs to get the\ntuition revenue and, later, the alumni financial\ngifts.  But mostly a university wants to do &#x27;research&#x27;,\nand the MBA program is a bit far from that.  Mostly\nthe rest of the university wants to turn out college\nprofs which, however, usually don&#x27;t make much money\nso aren&#x27;t good bets for gifts.  So, a university can\nswallow its pride and run an MBA program.<p>For some students, an MBA can get them on a good\nstart in business.  Alas, for someone already successful\non business, an MBA is highly questionable.  E.g.,\nfor someone already successful, they no doubt meet\nlots of people, even ones better to know than other\nMBA students.  For accounting, after a few tax seasons\nand discussions with a tax lawyer, likely know a lot\nabout accounting.  For business law, working with a lawyer\na little will likely teach you all you need to know about\nthat.  Really the main thing you need to know is your\nbusiness that you are making successful.<p>So many people see these points that a university might\nhave an &#x27;executive MBA&#x27; program where they can\nget successful business people through in less time\nwith less bother.<p>There may be some direction for you in the future where\nsomething in an MBA program would really help you,\neven be crucial, but this is not clear.  Or, can look\nat a lot of successful people in business, e.g., Gates,\nPage, Brin, without an MBA.  Or, if they want an MBA,\nthen they will hire one.<p>My guess would be that an MBA program would be a\nwaste of time, money, and effort for you and also\npossibly a severe shot in the gut of your career.\nIndeed, many profs will feel guilty that somehow\nthe university had gotten you to leave your successful\ncareer, and likely hurt it,\nfor the university&#x27;s questionable material.<p>If you can find an &#x27;executive MBA&#x27; program\nat a good school and really have the spare\ntime, then maybe okay.  Otherwise I&#x27;d advise\nyou to be very careful and actually go for an\nMBA only if you could find some astoundingly\ngood, special, and unique reason.

6818140,comment,6817366,6817366,1,0,strlen,,,"Background/humblebrag: my brother was an officer in Soviet Strategic Missile Forces, a branch of the VVS (no, he didn&#x27;t ride ICBMs like Dr. Strangelove, he programmed Forth instead). My father was in the Soviet equivalent of ROTC and was commissioned as reserve tank officer, my grandfather fought as a captain in the artillery unit during World War II -- from the very early battle all the way until the storm of Berlin -- and retired as a colonel afterwards. In short, while my family had been on the wrong side of the iron curtain, I think I&#x27;m qualified to give some advice -- from many stories my family has told -- as fundamentally, military forces are military forces.<p>There are many good reasons to join the military, but yours isn&#x27;t one of them. To be sure, it may be beneficial for you, but exactly for the reasons you don&#x27;t expect: there will most likely be no adventure for you, there will be a great deal of incredible boredom, and forced discipline.<p>The question is, how well do you learn/change your behaviour in a strict, highly structured, and top-down (but pretty much close to meritocratic) environment? Have you enjoyed working traditional (non-technical) jobs? How do you respond to bullying (while infamously and atypically pervasive in Soviet Union, it is something nearly all military forces have to a certain extent -- it is (wrongly, IMHO) justified as a way of maintaining &quot;esprit de corps&quot;)? I personally would collapse in that kind of an environment -- and the big reason my family moved to the US is because they knew I wouldn&#x27;t survive compulsory military service (even if I entered as an officer via the ROTC equivalent as a university student -- which was from time to time cancelled then reinstated).<p>Other people strive and advance: again, military is the closest thing we have to a meritocracy (look at the percentage of top military brass that come from ethnic minorities; compare that to the percentage of top business executive from traditionally disadvantage groups), you&#x27;ll interact with a cross-cut of your country&#x27;s population you&#x27;d otherwise never see, you&#x27;ll probably see the world, you&#x27;ll develop genuine relationships. If you manage to enter the right branch, you&#x27;ll also possibly build technical skills you can use elsewhere. My brother who entered via the Mozhaev Military Institute -- Russian equivalent of Westpoint/Air Force Academy -- was able to advance his technical skills tremendously (both as a student and during his service). Needless to say, the description my grandfather has given of liberating French resistance prisoners from a concentration camp was one of the most powerful stories told.<p>This has a great deal to do with your personality: if you&#x27;re a quiet and independent introvert, I&#x27;m slightly skeptical that the military will be a good place for you (but you&#x27;ll be hardly the only one -- again, it represents a wide cross cut of society and can be an advantage for certain roles). If you&#x27;re sociable, see obedience and patriotism as virtues (as opposed to morally neutral qualities -- useful only when they serve a greater cause like justice, kindness, liberty, or benevolence) you&#x27;ll like it; if you&#x27;ve read Heinlein and were surprised when others found him objectionable, you&#x27;ll enjoy it as well.<p>However, since you enjoy programming it likely means you&#x27;ve an aptitude for it: rather than start the endless search for &quot;the right occupation/vocation&quot;, learn how to apply your skills in the right way.<p>Here&#x27;s my advise: learn to overcome being distracted and bored easily while sitting, if you&#x27;re boredom with the kind of programming you do now, explore different branches. By writing software you can help others an immense amount, <i>especially</i> those in the military. There&#x27;s still time for you to join the military, especially if you&#x27;re fine with joining, e.g., cost guard, air national guard, reserve, etc...<p>Save money, if your state lacks a good commuinity college system (which is probably true for any state other than New York or California) and you don&#x27;t have the money to attend a state university, move to a state that does. In terms of California, sublease a bedroom in Cupertino, San Jose, or Santa Clara (you can&#x27;t afford SF), work full-time until you&#x27;ve established residency (you might not be able to get a job as a programmer, but you should be able to find a position in IT, NOC, or tech support -- which can be a stepping stone to software engineering or production-facing operations), then start attending De Anza or Foothill College (you can even do this while working full time, but it&#x27;s difficult -- however, part time work is actually easier to find in entry-level technical positions); afterwards transfer to a four year university (<i>any will do</i> -- Berkeley/UCLA/UCSD are best, but Davis, Santa Cruz, Riverside, Irvine, Cal Poly, Santa Clara, etc... still send many graduates to top-tier software companies). If you&#x27;re still interested in the military, do ROTC. Study a technical major as it&#x27;s much easier to, e.g., go to law school or medical school with a CS degree than it is to be a programmer with a psychology degree (though it is not impossible either).<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, the cold truth is that United States is moving towards a society rigidly stratified by education and occupation -- if you&#x27;re not doing knowledge work, you can at best hope to live paycheck to paycheck. It may not be just or fair, but I don&#x27;t see any other scenario playing out in the long term. Whatever steps you take, you will have to choose between a decent middle class lifestyle and starting at a computer screen all day (even if you&#x27;re not programming) <i>OR</i> doing something else and just getting by. If you spend time in the military, unless you plan to make the military your career (becoming a career officer) or perhaps entering the foreign service -- all of which require a college education anyway -- you will only delay that choice. A smart move could be to enter a military vocation that helps you along (e.g., becoming a network engineer in the military, then using G.I. bill and an IT job to pay for college/grad school).<p>Good luck, but make this choice based on reality of the military rather than some romantic view -- otherwise, you may quickly discover that Navy stands for &quot;never again volunteer yourself&quot;.",1385706068

6818101,comment,6817524,6817524,2,0,cfallin,,,"This is certainly an interesting read, and stack machines have a long history among alternative CPU architectures. But I think that the complaints this (admittedly 18-year-old) article levels against mainstream CPUs are largely unfounded with today&#x27;s chips. Or at least, increasing complexity is not a cause of decreasing performance, as is claimed, but rather a major reason that we&#x27;ve had such amazing leaps in computing power. Pipelining, branch prediction, out-of-order execution, multilevel caching, and clever tricks in many places all enable 3GHz CPUs that can peak at 4 instructions per cycle today. You&#x27;ll lose two orders of magnitude in performance if you try to throw all that out and go back to basics, as the article suggests. (You may reduce more than two orders of magnitude in power, and power is an interesting constraint in today&#x27;s systems; but the article didn&#x27;t specify low power as the goal.)<p>- &quot;Modern RISCs are slow because instructions take many cycles to execute&quot;: Latency is irrelevant as long as the pipeline remains filled. Pipeline length only matters when it&#x27;s in the critical path, e.g. cycles from fetch to branch execution determines the bubble size on a mispredicted branch.<p>- &quot;The pipeline must be flushed and refilled on branches&quot;? Only on mispredicts, which are rare with good predictors on most code.<p>- &quot;Cache makes the system more complex and expensive&quot;? But it also is the only way to have acceptable performance when DRAM accesses take 200 cycles or more.<p>- &quot;RISCs are slow at calls and returns&quot; due to many registers? A good compiler will only save as many registers as it clobbers; more registers reduce register pressure and spills/fills, improving perf. (This is a net perf increase from x86-32 to x86-64, for example.) The only significant cost is additional context-switch overhead.",1385705342

(YMMV; point of context made; details left as exercise for reader.) We can view this baseline as the objective essence of &quot;value&quot;: one needs the aggregate of these points to sustain life for one day, anything less begins the descent into death. We can also view anything substantially beyond standard deviations of this as unnecessary (albeit desirable). <i>SOMEBODY</i> has to produce this, be it basic sustenance farming or creation & maintenance of high-tech high-productivity machinery; <i>this work is necessary</i>.<p>The objective value of this baseline is the true &quot;poverty line&quot;: if you try to exist on less than this, you&#x27;re gonna die; if you can acquire substantially more than this, you can start indulging in relative luxuries. For sake of simple argument (detailed accuracy left to reader), we&#x27;ll use the official USA poverty line as the currency equivalent of this objective value of what it takes to keep a median human alive under normal conditions: about US$30 per day.<p>So...to keep one person alive & stable one day requires $30/day of work. This is invariant. If someone&#x27;s work produces $30 of value (exchangeably equivalent to those enumerated basic daily needs), one person maintains sustainable life another day; if the worker &quot;gives&quot; that to someone else, keeping none for himself, he is literally giving his life to the other. If his work produces $60 of value, he can sustain himself for two days (work one, idle the second), sustain himself for one day and spend the remainder on comforts & luxuries, or give $30 to another and keep both sustained for a day. Technology makes it easier for one to earn more with the same expenditure of effort.<p>The consternation about &quot;is work necessary?&quot; stems from who gets to decide how the extra earnings are distributed.<p>If you retain your extra earnings, you are saving for future idleness (vacation, retirement) or statistical fluctuations (temporary increased cost of acquiring necessities).<p>If you spend your extra earnings on comforts & luxuries, you are giving others the opportunity to work for their daily basic needs thru means other than direct acquisition (building cars, writing software, acting theatrically, etc. instead of sustenance farming, hewing trees, carrying water, etc).<p>If you give away your extra earnings strictly voluntarily (no coercion), you are charitable (sacrificing idleness, preparedness, or comfort/luxuries for others).<p>If you give away your extra earnings under coercion (if you don&#x27;t consent it will be taken from you, or worse), someone else is making the decision for you regarding how your extra earnings should be distributed - and this, quite understandably, produces enormous consternation.<p>(If your baseline earnings (the $30/day) are taken under coercion, your continued existence is threatened and the issue becomes a matter of self-defense - a separate topic to discuss.)<p>Is work necessary? Yes, insofar as <i>someone</i> has to expend effort which can be converted into providence of basic needs. If someone can work earning $300/day, then he can take the next nine days off, purchase comforts/luxuries which pay enough to sustain nine other people another day, or sustain nine other people another day <i>without</i> obligating the benefit of creating comforts/luxuries. This thread addresses this last point: <i>given no obligation to produce something exchangeable for basic needs, will a populace on the whole produce </i>more* value or less? and does the populace at large have the &quot;right&quot; to compel individuals to give up their extra earnings without compensation, or does the individual have an absolute &quot;right&quot; to keep his earnings and distribute them as he sees fit?<i>",1385705092

What about life insurance or health insurance?<p>In these cases I am pretty sure the insurers make their living by shrewd actuarial rate-setting that tries to make their &quot;average&quot; policy profitable, and by having a large enough customer base that the &quot;average&quot; case is statistically likely.<p>The way to make BTC insurance work would be similar: calculate the costs to replace BTC, times the likelihood of needing to, and charge more than that.",1385704846

I realize that these are good things but as a student of security it did raise the bar of difficulty for writing real-world exploits.<p>You need to compile your programs with the necessary flags to turn off these protections or if that isn't an option you need to try and use various counter measures like NOP slides, heap sprays, stack cookie replacement etc.  I wish I had been around to enjoy what seems like must have been the golden era of the 90's when writing buffer overflows was relatively easy.",1350583118

4670025,comment,4669180,4669180,1,0,nlh,,,"Great post. And a good point. But there are some exceptions to this.<p>I'm what you'd call a ""super casual"" twitter user. That is to say, I don't really use it other than for occasional real-time updates on things (After the NYC-area earthquake last year, Twitter was the first place I went to see what was up. And during the debates this year, I had fun following along with #debate.)<p>I can't be alone. And in those (rather specific, yes I know) cases, there is some opportunity for advertising, because just like when I use Google, I was searching for something, and to the OPs point, more open to buying that umbrella.<p>(For example, if a fact-checking group like PoliFact were advertising for me to follow them during my #debate search and ""get real-time fact-checking"", that's something I'd have totally subscribed to. Meanwhile I found them through sorting through the tweets instead.)<p>So I suppose it boils down to the same thing as with Google -- I don't really want to see ads when I'm reading Gmail, but I certainly don't mind them when I'm searching. Twitter could focus on promoted tweets / accounts during searches and I don't think they'd have the umbrella-in-a-synagogue problem.",1350583041

4670017,comment,4668772,4668772,12,0,bpatrianakos,,,"Wow. Its just so incredibly obvious that this is just MegaUpload in a new form and that the entire point is to allow sharing of copyrighted data. Kim is hanging this whole thing on plausible deniability but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what's really going on. This infuriates me. Sharing copyrighted files isn't what pisses me off. What does is the arrogance of Dotcom to try to pass this thing off like its for legit sharing of files. We have Google Drive, Dropbox, Box.net, Amazon's thing, iCloud and a billion others and no one really messes with them. There's no doubt in my mind that those services are storing some copyrighted data but they don't get messed with because they're truly legit. The feds didn't go after MegaUpload because it allowed people to share files that may or may not be copyrighted. It did so because the worst kept secret on the web was that if you want to download the new Lady Gaga single you could probably find it pretty easily on MegaUpload because that's basically what everyone was using it for. I honestly have no qualms about not backing up my claims with specific examples and evidence in this case because everyone here knows what was going on at MegaUpload and anyone trying to deny is either twisting their minds into a preztel with the mental gymnastics they'd have to do to convince them otherwise or they're just outright lying. I said it.<p>So now that they have this new approach I doubt they'll be successful. Because of the way the new Mega is set up you can't search for content. Allowing the ability to search for content would necessitate getting rid of their whole privacy scheme. I predict that the new Mega could still be used to share copyrighted files but the onus will be on third parties to keep track of such files in a database or something in order to provide links to people searching or it can just become a safe place to store your copyrighted files and share them on a case by case basis (through email, links on forums, or wherever). But if this really is supposed to be a legit service, which it isn't (come on, you know it), then I don't see how it can gain market share or mind share given the alternatives we already have had for a while now.",1350582973

Depends on how big you get and how well you hide, but if they do come after you, you cant just say ""Sorry, we thought it was legal"" and shutdown the site and expect them to stop going after you.<p>When you say, ""Furthermore users cant wager or bet on teams, they simply pick which team they support in a match.""  What does this mean?  Why would a user ""pick"" a team?  What happens if they pick a team and that team wins?  What happens if they pick a team and that team loses?",1350582532

I'm guessing it's because they're going to (shortly) stuff ads and other unwanted junk into peoples feeds, and 3rd party clients could easily just filter that out. Forcing people into their clients ensures the crap gets in front of eyeballs.<p>However, 3rd party clients were the route into Twitter for a huge amount of early adopters (and even later adopters). Most Twitter ""features"" (including the retweet concept, hashtags an even the word ""tweet"") were from the open community they started with. Moreover, their own clients are falling behind even simple 3rd party experiences. Twitter for Mac has, essentially, been abandoned. How many users will swallow an inferior experience, just for the privilege of getting adverts thrust in?<p>For my 2p, I certainly won't - to me, the value of Twitter has been decreasing over time, not increasing. As it moves towards ""mass market"", it seems to be seeking a broadcast model, where billions of users subscribe to feeds of a few celebrities. It's becoming a ""send only"" service - the total amount of micro-conversions I've had in the last year is much lower than even 2 years ago.<p>Perhaps this will work out for them as a company - a real time newswire for companies and celebs to send 140 character press releases, interspersed with adverts.

4669868,comment,4668747,4669666,1,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>That's a fair point, but I'm not sure where I'd draw the line. The worst consequences you cited -- identity theft, fraud, etc. -- are already illegal.</i><p>The best I've come up with so far is that when it comes to prior restraint, you have to consider (a) whether there is an effective remedy to undo any damage after the fact, and (b) whether there is any <i>legitimate</i> reason to do whatever you're proposing to restrain, and if so, what the adverse consequences might be. Then it's a balance, and personally I think it's safest to bias against any form of prior restraint if it's not a clear case.<p>In this case, once a severe privacy invasion has taken place, often the consequences are permanent. Sure, your kid might have another birthday and still enjoy the new toy, but you'll probably never get another chance to propose in the way you've spent the last six months planning and see the look on your wife-to-be's face before she says yes. I would have no problem with <i>severely</i> punishing someone who thought it was OK to deliberately spoil that kind of special, once-in-a-lifetime moment. On a more objectively measurable level, you'll never get back the three months of your life that you'll probably spend chasing banks and fixing your credit records if someone steals your identity.<p>I'll note in passing that none of this is the <i>really</i> bad stuff, which is less likely from my example of just being followed around for an afternoon but all too possible in a world of ever-increasing surveillance and data mining. The really bad stuff is probably when your career and/or private life get destroyed by an untrue allegation that taints your reputation irreparably. No amount of retractions and apologies printed later is going to remove the cloud of having once been accused of privately being a little too friendly with children, or abusing your spouse, or botching a medical procedure that left a patient permanently disabled, or stealing your client's private records and selling them to the competition.<p>That's the ""can the damage be undone"" side of things, so what about the damage from restricting the other action?<p>When it comes to someone following someone else around and systematically recording their behaviour, I find it hard to see any legitimate reason for doing it at all, other than genuine security/law enforcement considerations, in which case the usual caveats about due process and independent oversight must apply.<p>Just to be clear, I'm not talking about merely being in the same places as someone else here. That could happen coincidentally, and clearly there is a severe negative consequence to trying to prevent one person moving freely just because another happened to go the same way, as well as it being completely unrealistic. I'm more concerned about the kind of active surveillance I mentioned, such as someone deliberately following you and recording their observations. Perhaps more realistically, I don't see any real difference in privacy terms between that scenario and the use of an automated surveillance system that allows a similar picture to be built later by data mining, whether that is from CCTV cameras and facial analysis around town, or a cell provider recording the location of your phone, or your ISP logging all your Internet activity, or Google/Facebook tracking your web browsing history via beacons, bugs and other dubious practices. If anything, the latter type of surveillance is worse, because at least you can see the guy following you around and peering over your shoulder or through your home window.<p>(In case anyone's wondering, the proposal-related example came to mind because a popular wedding venue near where I live recently burned down. Obviously if that was a deliberate act of arson then it was criminal anyway, and the loss of the buildings and revenue to the operators was severe, but the really heartbreaking thing reading those stories was the idea that what should have been the happiest day of some couples' lives was going to be ruined because there wouldn't be time to make other arrangements. When it comes to issues like privacy, it is often the personal, emotional consequences rather than some measurable financial or practical cost that are the most damaging, and I think it is regrettable that many legal systems seem to assign little if any weight to such harm.)",1350581528

4669818,comment,4661656,4661906,1,0,bunderbunder,,,"> Editors that make me take may hands off the keyboard in order to click around in the gui to move around my files are productivity killers.<p>A couple thoughts on that:<p>1.  Allowing you to take your hands off the keyboard in order to click around in a GUI is not necessarily the same thing as making you do it.  Even in Visual Studio experienced users' hands tend to stay put.  For example, to open up a file to see some other element's code, there's no sense in bothering with the mouse.  Not when with a single keypress you can jump not only to the correct file, but to the correct position within that file.<p>2. On the other hand, needing to consult the manual in order to find out how to do something is often more time-consuming than mousing through a menu.  In a well-developed GUI, mousing through a menu is also the quickest way to figure out a new keyboard command.  Much quicker than Googling or digging through manpages.<p>3. Even if you haven't bothered to learn the keyboard commands for your graphical editor, if you're switching what file you're working in frequently enough that the fraction of the second it takes to click on a tab is adding up to anything remotely significant, then you've probably misplaced the blame for your productivity issues.  If you're switching files that much, the amount of time you're wasting on mental context-switching is probably immense.<p>Naturally all this assumes that one is using a well-designed graphical text editor, and sadly the vast bulk of graphical text editors simply aren't anywhere near as refined as emacs or vim.  Especially not if you need one that's cross-platform.  But let's be careful not to make radios out of coconuts here:  The reason emacs and vim are so effective is because they are venerable, not because they are textual.",1350581055

I am currently enrolled in MITx - 6.00x online course and I too would like to use Python for web development. If you are looking for more meaningful material on Python I would suggest visiting the (<a href=""http://www.realpython.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realpython.com/</a>) website and download the e-book ($14). This book is full of real time python usage and it does cover web-development as well.

We criminalize the act; not necessarily the surrounding things that made the act possible.<p>Spoiling my kid's birthday surprise might make you a dick, but I don't want it to make you a criminal. It's also hard to see a good way to enforce this kind of thing. As long as all a person is doing is visiting public places, then lacking a specific compelling reason (e.g., restraining orders issued by a judge), I'm not sure you should be able to prevent someone else from visiting those same public places.<p>These are definitely issues that are going to become more important as the amount of data we generate continues to grow.

There is a good Zend Framework integration layer in PHP. So this makes me wonder, why we don't hear more about it here and other places?<p>Is it that it's more verbose when it comes to code? The only place I often see dojo mentioned would be javascript positions in banks since they probably use a lot of their widgets.<p>I seriously think that this is the most underpraised (is that even a word?) javascript framework, so I would love to hear why people are not using it, is it because everyone knows jquery/needs their plugins?

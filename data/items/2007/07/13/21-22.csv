Maybe small business could use the API to integrate with something tracking their funding, but there are already traditional tools for such things. <p>I wonder if you can - just from the description of each transaction - decide what company is getting your money. If you know who is getting it, you can correlate that a database of the companies country of origin, type of business, location, etc. Then you can imagine a set of mashups you can do.<p>There might be some collaborative filtering that can be done as well, based on your purchases and perhaps rating of satisfaction of those purchases... This would require people to share (even if anonymously) their spending patterns. ",1184363438

2939527,comment,2939376,2939376,2,0,pgroves,,,"1) I think you're too worried about the dev not being a ""mobile dev."" There really aren't any developers with 5 yrs experience on the currently dominant mobile platforms b/c they haven't been around that long. Good developers can pick up new technologies at a reasonably quick speed. A web developer has some server/client experience. Good enough.<p>2) IMO you don't need to worry that the developer is more interested in a paying gig. Being treated as a valuable professional who is compensated for their time is not a bad angle to keep the dev's head in the game. Act grateful that he's helping you do something you consider important and then pay him. That can still go a long way.<p>3) I'm biased (because I'm a developer not a V.C.), but I'd say ""what you can do beforehand"" is mainly just getting the product as far along as possible. It sounds like you've already taken the leap of faith so just try to get to v1.0 quickly. Building a product and then selling it is not as unreasonable as some market pre-validation advocates say it is.<p>4) If you really have taken the leap of faith, act like it. You are going to build this product and sell it. You're just going to have some meetings to see if the V.C.'s  want to come along for the ride.<p>5) To paraphrase Sh*t My Dad Says: ""Son, let women figure out why they won't date you, don't do it for them."" Applies here as well. In a less coarse example, when I was 25 and working at my first startup I was frantically trying to get all our ducks in a row before some big meetings with V.C.'s and potential enterprise clients. The CEO told me, ""Don't worry about it. At some point you have to stand up and say what you have to say and let them challenge you on it. That's where we're at.""",1314661931

I won't say that building an open source project is quite easy but the coding part is definitively the easiest one for me. Unfortunately, a developer does not live with fresh water and (coding) love. 
So when Sean and Kevin came to me and shared with me their vision about monetizing open source projects, it was obvious I had no choice than to say yes. Simply because their idea is brillant. 
Actually, it lets the freedom for the authors of open source web applications to continue their development roadmap and at the same time, Bushi.do provides all the tools to promote and monetize the applications. I see that as a win-win situation.

Open source is, in general, just more practical.<p>And yeah, there are a handful of SaaS products that are open-sourced, but most aren't maintained to a high-enough quality for our tastes. We'll work with developers to up the standard.",1314658966

The large copy to button in the ribbon accomplishes that task nicely.<p>Remember, its not that user's cant remember right clicking, its that they shouldn't have to. Why should you need two different types of clicks, and 2 sub menus to Send a file to a drive, when you can accomplish it with a single click and a single sub-menu (as is demonstrated in the ribbon)<p>Making the initial learning curve simple will have implications on the overall feel & appeal of the operating system, but this is something that is difficult to quantify with simple software metrics.",1314658908

If you don't want to lose confidence I'd spend every waking hour between now and your sit-down finding a passionate mobile developer.<p>On the other hand, just because your programmer became more excited when funding appeared doesn't mean he's not devoted now. It's not entirely irrational. But that's on your judgement.<p>In any case. If you don't like your position, improve on it. Unless you literally get bad news on the phone during your meetings with investors the discussion should be about what you've done, and what you are doing to solve the problems you have (and good news, everybody likes good news if you have it).",1314658824

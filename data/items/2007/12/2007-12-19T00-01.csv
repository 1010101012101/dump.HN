You'll be more motivated and have more fun if you work on something just for fun, even if you're never going to release it. Go write some video games or something. :)<p>If you do want to work on an open source project, you'll probably want to start with a small isolated task, so you won't have to understand how the whole behemoth works and can focus on just the parts you have to interface with.",1198025880

90972,comment,90782,90782,0,0,euccastro,,,"Find someone around you who can program, and somehow get them to mentor you. It's less intimidating, but rather equivalent, if you ask them if they could be available for questions every now and then. I think many people who really like to program will be happy to help you out, as long as you do your homework and show respect for their time.<p>Ideally, you'd work in the same room as your mentor, but it should be enough if you can meet once a day or so. A longer feedback cycle, or mentoring remotely through the net, is less than ideal, but anything you can get is better than being on your own.<p>Ask them what language they'd be more comfortable helping you out with. Start playing with that language. For that, follow other advice in this thread. Don't expect to be spoonfed.<p>If you get stuck in something after giving it a honest try, ask. Every now and then, show them what you are doing, even if you have no immediate problems. Chances are that they can steer you into better ways to think about problems, simplify your code, etc. These are insights that only come through experience. They are often hard to explain out of the blue, and hard to internalize so that you can put them to use later, when explained in abstract terms. They are best communicated in little doses, while commenting on actual code that addresses actual problems. Ideally, <i>your</i> code and <i>your</i> problems.",1198025521

90966,comment,90898,90918,0,0,eru,,,"> Other than the fact Linux has a cool name, could someone explain why I should use Linux over BSD?<p>No. That's it. The cool name, that is. We worked very hard on creating a name that would appeal to the majority of people, and it certainly paid off: thousands of people are using linux just to be able to say ""OS/2? Hah. I've got Linux. What a cool name"". 386BSD made the mistake of putting a lot of numbers and weird abbreviations into the name, and is scaring away a lot of people just because it sounds too technical.",1198024679

I guess I just don't quite 'get' it - not having worked on an application that scaled to the point that session access was the bottleneck.",1198024355

90960,comment,90387,90949,0,0,mojuba,,,"<i>We don't need a clear and unambiguous definition of intelligence in order to tell that other human beings are intelligent.</i><p>The problem here is that not every human being is intelligent and yes, we are actually trying to define intelligence through IQ tests, for example.<p><i>Likewise, we don't need one in order to start trying to create an artifice that impresses us into thinking it also is intelligent.</i><p>So when you need accounting software you say: ""write me something that will be as clever as my accountant"".

4710880,comment,4710702,4710702,1,0,slckfielder08,,,"Freelance marketing is a much different beast than freelance programmers. That's because, unlike programmers, most people think they can do marketing, without any experience or training. The same cannot be said for programming.<p>Those that are wise enough to acknowledge that they're not an expert marketer tend to bring the job in-house. Marketing is much more hands on with the business end and I believe people feel more comfortable having someone there day in and day out.<p>With that said, there are places like elance, RFPDB, and Craigslist where marketers can find work. However I've found that personal recommendations are the best way to go (I know this is obvious).<p>My experience has proven that these sites are extremely ineffective. People ask for the world at very low pay. Like the many different programming languages, there are many different disciplines of marketing. I'm not sure if programmers are expected to know every language, but many people looking for freelance marketing help expect someone to have expertise in all forms of marketing (i.e. SEO, Social, PPC, Media, Content, Email, etc). Not impossible, but not common.<p>I'm sure paragraph 3 was all you were looking for, but I thought I'd add in some color to the answer :) Hope this helps.",1351479409

Just like a fruit vendor can't decide on how I should eat it similarly a product manufacturer can't decide on how I want to consume a product. I am just customizing a product for me and not competing with the product manufacturer. So, I do not see anything wrong in it.<p>> <i>Also, I don't see an obvious way to allow users to change your code without allowing competitors to steal your work, whether directly or indirectly.</i><p>That's a fair point but let me assert here that the onus is on the product manufacturers to do this without violating basic principles of purchasing goods. Any good once purchased is in the hands of the purchaser and he/she may choose to customize to good as per his/her needs. Of course, the purchaser should not be allowed to compete by putting up a layer on the existing platform which should be illegal or unethical. However, if he is not doing so no entity should allow to control how he wants to use it.<p>> <i>If a user voluntarily chooses to buy a closed product, what's the harm? Freedom includes the right to make self-detrimental decisions.</i><p>:-) This is not an appropriate assertion. We are discussing whether a closed product should be allowed in the first place.

(i.e. we'll buy your application if we like it.) For some people, mostly executives and other business oriented disciplines, this is a fair deal as it is what the free market bears; they do not and will not care about long-term health of the   industry, the other side of the stick, or the designer on the line. It just doesnt click for them, and thats understandable somewhat because theyve never been in a similar situation before.<p>But a developer using this service knows exactly what this entails, they are aware of the concept of spec-work, and maybe even had to do it for some reason. My problem is not the amount of money per-se, but with doing work for nothing, hoping that it will pay in the future. A developer cannot claim ignorance.

In fact, some have gone so far as to create the ""no-spec"" movement: <a href=""http://www.no-spec.com/faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.no-spec.com/faq/</a><p>I don't agree with this. There is a market for $300 logos that many designers won't fulfill.<p>I've ran several logo contests and one icon contest on 99designs for $250-$300 per contest. I'd definitely use them again for a logo.<p>While I received 150-200 submissions in each contest, there were around a dozen that I would consider acceptable. Many ""designs"" were either clip art, or very poorly made. I also got the feeling that submissions are shopped around. That is, submitted to other contests if they aren't accepted for one. I don't blame them.<p>My first contest winner was a guy from Pakistan, the second was an 18-year-old from Germany, and the third winner was from Indonesia. Another was from North Carolina. So most likely, you are off-shoring your work where $300 is a larger payday.<p>If you plan on running your own contest, you need to plan some time to work it. It is imperative to give feedback on each submission, and constantly rate them. This is the difference between getting 12 submissions and getting 120 submissions. Many of the people submitting designs are learning and really appreciate thoughtful feedback.<p>In most of these cases, I would not have hired a designer otherwise. It takes too much time, and it is hard to find a designer I'd trust to produce something I'd be happy with for a logo. If I was working on an entire site design with a budget of $5-10K then I would find a trusted professional.",1351478551

That was a great thing to do.<p>I heard the Siri comparison brought up on a podcast I listen to (something on 5by5, don't remember which show). The theory they mentioned was that while Siri was certainly the feature they really marketed for that revision, it wasn't the core feature.<p>So a more apt comparison may be if the iPhone shipped with a buggy phone app that got updated day one, but that's not quite an apples to apples comparison. And Siri was a big reason people bought the 4S, just like Offixe is a big reason to buy Surface.<p>With Google, that's just their MO. They release early and often, that's just part of their experience. Apple (to my memory) hasn't done that historically, but seems to be going it more lately. Siri is the obvious example. OS X 10.0 could be considered a beta, but it didn't even boot by default on the computers it was pre-installed on.

It's a significant distinction. :) I'm also firmly against anti-circumvention laws; I see the debate as being whether Amazon, Apple, etc. should be allowed to <i>try</i> to lock down their products.<p>I don't see why there should be a double standard with bits vs. atoms: that software is allowed to be closed as part of your business model, but hardware is not. And if we're going to insist on user freedoms for hardware, we should also insist on them for software; however, that carries a risk of reduced wealth creation if there are too few property protections for creators.<p>(It is admittedly awkward to take a firm stand that says ""This is a complex issue with no perfect answers"".)",1351476712

Core C (or whatever, but C out of momentum) functions with the rest of the system build up in Scheme.</i><p>Thank god there are people who share this vision! I have solemnly promised to myself that I will write a new vim in exactly this fashion if no one has done so in the next 10 years.<p>One thing that I don't understand about contemporary developers is the aversion to running their editors in a terminal. The benefits of doing this are significant (e.g. session management with tmux, remote pair programming via the same), but programmers leave them behind for what is ultimately just eye candy.<p>The major reasons for this are the difficulty in binding complex key chords in a terminal, and the poor implementation of OS X's Terminal.app (both of which can be worked around today with a little work, and a proper X terminal). If this terminal-based workflow is going to thrive in the future, what will need to be modernized is the terminal.<p>So you heard it here first: if a new vim built atop a Lisp interpreter running on a new data-centric, mixed character-grid/HTML5-webview terminal emulator does not appear in the next 10 years, I'm on the job.<p> Some excellent musings on the subject: <a href=""http://lubutu.com/idea/ivo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lubutu.com/idea/ivo</a><p> This would all be easier if I could love to learn Emacs, but Vim modal editing is a pernicious addiction.",1351476382

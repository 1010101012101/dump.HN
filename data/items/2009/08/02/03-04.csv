But the main failing of the original design of CSS (which could resolve most of these arguments) is that they didn't include a way to do page layout in the way that tables work.  Many years later, with CSS3, they've finally adding it.  But it seems like an obvious layout deficiency given the previous use of tables for layout.",1249185512

Assuming he starts on C, he gives them C-D-E, and then A. He also makes a point of making a bigger leap from C to A (a minor third) from between C-D-E (each a major second).<p>At that point, it's hard to see how the crowd could come up with anything _but_ a pentatonic scale! He's given them four notes, and established that a small jump is a major second and a big jump is a minor third. So when makes the big jump from E to G and the crowd follows along it's not all that magical.<p>If he'd just given them C-D-E and made a small step stage left, would they have gone for B or Bb instead?<p>It's still a fun little performance to watch, but I don't think it proves anything about the pentatonic scale being hardwired into the human brain.",1249184851

The beauty of its design is that the server need not play any role beyond delivering the compiled output...or rpc/json requests for data if you need some.

One thing they don't mention is how difficult it is to figure out where your sales are coming from; there's no Google analytics or referrer logs for app sales -- you have to do things like become your own affiliate through LinkShare and assign different codes to your own links if you have multiple distribution channels.",1249182593

737024,comment,736794,736794,0,0,shawnjgoff,,,"The problem is that your ""object code"" is someone else's ""source code"". When you follow standards, it's easy for people to use what you've published; when you don't, it's painful.<p>A simplistic example: say you put out a typical web page with a navigation area and content area. Maybe for some reason, your website is much easier for me to use if I put the navigation above or below the content or maybe you put it on the left, and it works better for me on the right. If you used standard practices (CSS) to position your elements on the page, it's really easy for me to go in and mold that to exactly what I want. Why? Because it's the standard, so there are plenty of tools out there for this. All I do is tell the browser to overlay my css rule on your page and I'm done. On the other hand, if your layout is done with tables, well then it becomes much more difficult because you didn't follow the rules that the majority of us have agreed to.",1249182574

737022,comment,736952,736987,0,0,jsz0,,,"The distribution channel for SmartPhone software is the Internet. You don't see BlackBerry apps being sold at retail B&M stores in tiny little boxes. Developers sell their apps usually through a web site with their own checkout system that delivers a binary to the user who then must figure out how to install it. With the iTunes store the first part of the model should be the same -- the developer creates a web site and promotes their application through ad buys, promo copies to reviewers, and whatever other tactics they think will work. The only difference is the checkout stage would link to the iTunes Store URL to complete the transaction.<p>I think all these developers are really missing the point that built in App Stores on devices are simply a delivery medium. You shouldn't rely on it to be a discovery medium for potential customers.",1249182443

737020,comment,736989,736989,0,0,profquail,,,"I bet they said it's wrong because they are counting ""06"" as ""6"".<p>If you consider that each value (day/month/year) has to be at least 10, then the month must be 10 or 12 (not 11, because of the duplicate ""1"").<p>Then, your day value must be somewhere in [23, 29] for October, or in [30] for December.<p>After that, just look at the remaining 6 digits and order them in ascending order.<p>Example: If you choose October (10), you could pick 27 as the day, which leaves [3,6] U [8, 9] for the year digits, so you'd get 10/27/3456 (US format).<p>EDIT: In fact, I think that example may be the best answer, because choosing a day less than 27 makes the year value larger, so using 27, 28, or 29 should minimize the year. Since you want the earliest date, 10/27/3456 should be it.",1249182197

As far as I can tell, the MacBook Pro has been a somewhat better gaming rig than the iMacs for the last months, which isn't what you'd expect. Really, they're just correcting that oddity in their product lineup.<p>The article may well be spot on in its analysis on the mobile devices. I suspect it will very much come down to how they treat developers. The iPhone in its current incarnation isn't anywhere near the DS or PSP in terms of price point. (DS: €150, PSP: €170, iPhone: €1000) The audience for the games is therefore very different (and presumably smaller) as well. In terms of hardware, the iPhone is (apparently) roughly equivalent to the PSP but with better connectivity.<p>The way to go is to figure out what kinds of games typical iPhone owners play on their other devices, and develop games to that need.",1210193982

183847,comment,183535,183535,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Not a lot of people are talking about the very serious problem of your developer now owning 35% stake in your business.  Even <i>if</i> you manage to pull all of this stuff together by yourself, you're <i>still</i> screwed.  You cannot raise more money as long as there's a ""ghost"" shareholder...if you do it without telling the investors about it you're liable to get sued, and if you tell them about it, they'll do the math and figure that your business has to be nearly twice as successful for them to make any money on the deal.  It's like she's bought the whole series A round.<p>If she were actually ""all in"" on the business, 35% for a developer would be perfectly acceptable, even if she wasn't taking on as much risk.  But, you need a vesting schedule in these kinds of agreements.  At least then, you know you get four years of labor from the person--or they lose (some or all of) their stake.<p>I'd suggest going back to the drawing board (and back to a real job, while you gather your wits and save up some money).  If you can buy out your former partner (hopefully for a pittance, though it sounds like your former partner is far more dangerous at the negotiating table than you are), you can outsource the remainder of the work--with better contracts.  Or, learn to code on nights and weekends and finish it yourself.<p>But, if you can't buy out her stake, you can't build a business.  It's hard enough to build a profitable business when everybody is working full-time on it.  It's going to be damned near impossible when 35% of your company is doing nothing for the bottom line.  Raising money will be impossible.  Making it profitable will be difficult (while stock holders don't have any particular right to be paid dividends, at 35% she's got voting rights that have to be dealt with...depending on where you're incorporated, you might find 35% is a dangerously high ownership stake).  And any exit, unlikely as that is, will be bitter sweet.",1210193717
183846,story,,,25,35,chriszf,"Ask YC: When did we stop wanting useful software?",,"Why is it that all webapps have to be 'fun' or 'social' applications these days? I wrote some software (as a webapp) that I think is pretty useful, but has only the barest and most rudimentary social networking features. I showed it to a co-worker whose first response was ""cool"". His second response, a few days later was, ""I'm going to build a copy of your program, only I'm going to make it focus on the social and sharing aspect. I hope you don't mind.""<p>Now, on one hand, I'm not really offended, since my app is just a clone of an existing (but unavailable to me) app. On the other hand, I'm pretty offended that to this guy, software isn't good unless you can socialize through it. I'll admit that there is a natural social aspect that comes out of the idea, but whatever happened to solitary software that just helps you be productive and organized?

There're a <i>lot</i> of people that still suggest that, and it really doesn't work, as you've found out the hard way.<p>I dunno what advice I'd give to you personally - it's a hard situation, as many others have pointed out.  Probably cut your losses, chalk it up to an expensive learning experience, and move on, then try again some other time.  As I mentioned in another comment, I think it's fairly unlikely that this developer left you usable code that someone else could pick up, so it'd be difficult to get a contract developer to push it to finish line.  You could learn to hack yourself - Python and Django are not difficult - but it'd set you back at least a couple months, and then you'd still have to implement everything.<p>[Edit: last paragraph was on the assumption that her work was not even demoable, but rereading your post, it sounds like you've gotten to alpha but just need to incorporate the feedback in.  If that's the case, a contractor might work, but be aware that it's harder to read code than to write code, and if the code quality is bad enough any contractor would just have to throw everything out and start from scratch.]<p>If you <i>can</i> find a technical cofounder, someone that you trust that you <i>know</i> is a good developer, I'd do that (and give the decent equity from the start!), and then they can probably write the whole site from scratch in a couple months.

I've read Gato's book that this essay is taken from, and he does a good job of stating the problem, but doesn't step far enough into it to look at how you restructure society to live in a freer way.

183816,comment,181392,182234,0,0,bkovitz,,,"Actually, I believe group theory emerged very gradually from many simultaneous developments.  Other sources: permutations, symmetries of crystals and linear transformations, quaternions and matrices (though theory of equations was indeed the main driver).  I believe it wasn't until after a bunch of these had reached a high level of development (around 1880) that the abstract group concept began attracting attention as a field of research, because then people could see its use for unifying all those others.  Abel's proof for 5th-degree polynomials came out in 1824, and Galois' general proof was published in 1846, so this was slow going, even by nineteenth-century standards.<p>BTW, I thought I read that Gödel worked pretty much as a lone wolf on his stuff, as most mathematicians weren't into it.  And the trend has continued: foundations of mathematics has gotten research attention from surprisingly few people.  I'm not 100% sure of this, though.<p>But anyway, yeah, proving that something can't be done is definitely a big deal.  Interesting observation.  I will percolate on that.",1210192027

So you added some value that a hacker couldn't get by just going off and doing the same thing on his own.<p>In the startup I mentioned above, the founders were all technical people and didn't really add anything of business value besides that.

183810,comment,183535,183535,0,0,JayNeely,,,"Okay. Let's take stock. From what I understand...<p><i>Your Resources:</i><p>* A partially complete web app, for patients with chronic conditions; helps them manage their problems & has some social network features.<p>* Feedback from your alpha testing.<p>* 45% equity in the company (with the ability to recover the extra 29%), which owns all of the IP.<p>* A limited amount of time before you must seek means to support yourself.<p><i>Your Goals:</i><p>* Develop your web app to a beta-worthy release.<p>* Get funds to develop to a point where you can charge, or maintain it long enough to exit.<p><i>Your Obstacles:</i><p>* Your user-interface isn't presentable enough to for your app to go public.<p>* Without a developer, you have no means to improve the front-end of your app, or implement new features.<p>* You have no funding left, very little personal money, and debt.<p><i>What I think your plan should be:</i><p>1) Ask yourself if you truly believe that your app can be satisfactorily profitable. Ask yourself if you're willing to work hard over the next 2 years (at least) to make it happen.<p>2) Reduce your expenses as much as possible. You said your monthly outgoing is $2,000. If I can live on $800/month in Boston, you can reduce your expenses to at least $1k to $1.5k. This pushes back your horizon for total cash failure.<p>3) Increase your income, even if it's just a short-term influx of cash. Whether it's through another loan, selling non-essential assets, or fully-booking half a month with temporary gigs.<p>4) Learn to code, and instead of continuing development, modify your user-interface to a level where you can release to users. Forget about advanced features. Basic functionality in a working interface, with the promise of advanced functionality, can get enough signups to take you to the next step.<p>5) Offset costs, and/or get to profitability. You haven't shared your business model; if it's offering the app as a white-label service to institutions, focus on getting your first customers once you have the basic functionality in a working interface. A modest amount of users, however dispersed, should be enough to at least demonstrate interest, and get them to license it from you on a trial basis.<p>If you're intending to monetize it through users directly, charging isn't feasible until you're offering advanced functionality, and advertising isn't feasible until you have a ton of users. But affiliate sales can generate income with even a modest number of users, and it's likely that the nature of their conditions makes them likely consumers for specialized products, possibly that are highly profitable.<p>6) Focus development on rapid iteration. Prioritize your feature list by simplicity and usefulness, and either split your attention between adding small, useful features one at a time while working on the larger improvements, or outsource development of the small stuff(one at a time, so you build relationships and can measure quality) and focus solely on the larger improvements.<p>7) After the three to six months the above should take you, take stock again and consider if you want to get another co-founder (if there are some <i>really</i> large improvements that need to be made that are out of your coding league completely), and/or seek more funding.<p>8) Let us know how it goes!",1210191279

Their core competency is email analytics, and there's not really a reason for them to create their own email client.  Why create Xobni webmail and get a 10% market share of power users, when you can create a Xobni plugin for Outlook, Yahoo, hotmail and Gmail and get over 50% of email power users.  Eventually Xobni will expand beyond power users.<p>> <i>3. Don’t build a social network, just make email fun to use and make it easy for people to see what their email graph looks like.</i><p>Yes, it's fun, but that fun is hard to monetize.

Yes.  But, I think the idea of completely automating interactions with ""Level 1""  and ""Level 2"" contacts is taking it a bit too far.

The value is less in the data, and more in the interpretation -- HR departments aren't statistical consultants.  One option would have to develop a consulting arm to maximize the value here.  Another, more scalable, option would be to develop a killer product that does the analysis for the employer.<p>> <i>6. Attack other verticals on the local machine</i><p>Maybe.  But there's more money in email analytics than in file system, IM or iTunes analytics.  As for gathering data from other consumer activities, email is still a far from solved problem (and offers far more valuable data).  Let Xobni focus on that!",1210191029

Otherwise you're out of luck.<p>DrScheme's language levels, where constrained languages help beginners avoid the strange error messages one gets by accidentally invoking an advanced language feature, are unique, as far as I know.  Correct me if a learning tool for any non-Lisp language has succeeded in implementing the same sort of thing.  Otherwise, I think it's obvious that if you have specific desired constraints for a limited language, some kind of Lisp is your best bet.",1210190877

They tell you how it works upfront, they pay you one-off for winning the competition, and they pay you royalties when companies buy the software. It would be immoral to judge the best entry as being not up to scratch, not pay out, and still sell it on, but that's not what happens. (the contest is re-run in that case)<p>Besides, it's what you call a (sustainable) business model.",1210190786

It sounds like the ""it's nearly done"" is based on the developer's word, and there isn't actually anything demoable right now.  If that's true, and given that it's taken her 12 months to finish a <i>Django</i> website, I think it's a good bet that all her existing code is unusable and will have to be thrown out.  If you understand Django, it should not take you a year to finish a website; more likely, the dev doesn't understand Django and doesn't really have anything working.",1210190656

There is a common misperception about how well large companies can respond to threats to their cash cow products (and thus many people opt not to enter markets where they will be competing with those theoretical products from the large company).<p>That said, I definitely believe the single biggest threat to the growth and success of Xobni is their absolute dependence on Outlook in the current iteration.  But, by the time MS releases a tool that does some of what Xobni does, Xobni will (I would hope) have a multi-platform version with a dozen additional features.  Xobni obviously doesn't plan to stand still waiting for MS to catch up to them.",1210190495

This option will save you time, money and energy. If you decide to try them then write a review about them over here as more people like you can use them (if they are good). - GOOD LUCK.",1210190460

183792,comment,183498,183648,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Agreed. I'd call myself a fairly capable programmer, althouth not an expert in their main technologies (.NET and Java) and from the few times I attempted to compete in component development, the amount of work involved just seemed a bit much. (especially the amount of unit tests) I'm not sure where the article's author got the ""1-2 components per week, part time"" figure from. It seemed to take me almost a week full time to complete one $500 component. (which, inevitably, didn't win)<p>I'm not complaining I didn't win: the judges clearly thought the other competitors did a better job, and they were probably right. But it's anything but easy money.<p>TopCoder seems to be overrun with developers from developing (largely Asian, as far as I can tell) countries where salaries (and cost of living) is much, MUCH lower, which is also keeping the prize money low. $500 (before tax) for a week's worth of work is just not attractive to me, I can make (and have made) 3-5x that doing normal consulting. (where the probability of being paid in the first place is a lot higher)<p>There is, of course, nothing actually wrong with this. This may well be the best way to outsource development to cheap labour: if it's not good enough, don't pay them anything!<p>There's probably a certain amount of practice to this, over time you figure out what the judges want, and what not to spend time on, but to make a competitive amount of money, you'd still have to have a very high success rate. The article is somewhat misleading in this respect.<p>That said, if you're in it for the fun, it's great!",1210190428

They need at least a few models in the $200-$250 range, even if they have to make them ""lower-end"". But I think Cortex A15 will be a great match for that, unless they totally messed up the cross-platform optimization, and ChromeOS will be slower on ARM than on a similar-performance x86 chip. Plus, you'll get at least double the battery life - which is kind of necessary for a Web-only/mobility device.",1338321571

4039423,comment,4037645,4039306,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"For most of the 90s gas was underpriced compared to historical levels. This was due to a variety of reasons, some technological, some economic, some geopolitical. Over the last decade or so gas has gone up in price though the price is still quite volatile. Short-term estimates are that gas prices probably won't go much higher. Longer-term estimates are tricky, but increasing production of crude oil and natural gas from North America will probably cause prices to fall.<p>The ""finite resource"" aspect is a bit of a misnomer. Yes, oil is finite, and it is used up. But what matters is how long can current rates of use be maintained. If it's only a decade then prices will definitely skyrocket, if it's more like a century then prices might not outpace inflation.<p>I could argue all day about technology and production but the best argument is the simplest one, more often than not the claim that ""this time it's different"" is seldom justified. What argument do you have that ""this time it's different"" in regard to cost and volume of oil production vs, say, the 1970s?<p>People like you have been arguing that we're going to run out of oil since the 1950s.

4039420,comment,4037447,4038541,1,0,mdkess,,,"P/E ratio is a terrible, meaningless way to evaluate the price of a share. It sounds remotely technical, and hey, there are numbers there so I guess people talk about it like it's important. P/E ratio is the ratio between profits to price per share. If the company had shares trading at $100 and their profits were $10/share, their P/E ratio would be 10. The thing is, P/E ratio doesn't capture expenditures very well, or long term corporate plans. So if a company is spending a ton of money trying to expand their business, they will have a really high P/E ratio. That doesn't make it a bad thing, just a measure of how much they're spending. AMZN is spending a ton of money lately, so they are not as profitable as they could be (and hence, high P/E ratio), but it is presumably to secure their future success.",1338321373

At the same time, though, lining up your schedule to have every Friday off (which was a rare possibility) was highly prized!<p>My generalization is that people in their 20s favor flexibility to accomodate nightlife (and fun in general), whereas family folk favor a set reliable schedule structured around their kid's schedule and maximizing time with the significant other.<p>Bottom line though, employers should sit down with their hires on the first day and ask them what's important to them in their personal life so it can be accommodated.",1338321089

There are ways you can encourage the ""dummy"" user to desire phone support, and then gently point out that there are _other_ providers that have that. If you do this properly the dummy client will actually feel they've had good customer service (and you could argue that they have, we just weren't meant for each other) and your over eager competition gets stuck with the dummies.<p>Edit: I thought I should mention, for a startup it can often be unclear which customer is/will be valuable and you can learn a lot from the ""wrong"" ones, so be careful with ""selective denial"" unless you've run the numbers and are sure what you are doing",1338320958

One way (the way to which you allude) is to buy it and hope that in the future, someone thinks it's worth more than what you paid for it. Some people call this the Greater Fool theory.<p>The other way is to treat owning shares like owning part of a business. (You might hear about this as the Graham-Dodd or Graham-Dodd-Buffett model.) In this case you consider the value of the company as the current liquidation value of the company's assets plus the total amount of free cash the business can produce over its useful lifespan.<p>The math of that valuation gets a little bit interesting, because if you project the free cash growth into the future ten or twenty years, you can use a present value calculation to get a fair price for the company right now. Divide that by the number of outstanding shares and you get a target price per share.<p>One of the flaws of this method is that you need to have a sane sense of the growth rate of free cash, so you'd better base that on a stable and measurable history, and you have to verify that against sanity and the company's published plans.<p>Graham's real insight was saying ""If you do all that work, also add a significant margin of safety to account for any flaws in your calculations.""<p>Of course you shouldn't use reported earnings for these calculations; they're far too easy to manipulate under GAAP and accrual accounting.

As one of the commenters on this thread so wonderfully said:<p>> No, you're not some amazing savant that has popped up out of the mass of mediocrity that is humanity.<p>We are, every single one of us, a fallible creature full of fault, vanity, and ego. To argue that I am under the 'influence of cognitive dissonance' because I am falling prey to one of life's most unstoppable impulses is perhaps the strongest example I've yet seen of the absurdity of rational behaviour as the highest truth.<p>There is a time to be rational and to appeal to such sensibilities, and as hackers we live in those times more than most people. Crafting, debugging, and similar work pleads for rationality; indeed it is a necessary ingredient for much of the work a hacker does. But its applicability has definite limits, and as with any tool it's critical to know where those limits lie.<p>The core act of deceit comes when, drunk on the power and clarity of thought that rationality brings, the hacker mind tries to apply this tool to matters of the heart or soul. To pretend that the behaviour of a parent towards their child has its basis in rational thought is to presume rationality is a more human trait than love, or than the desire to express one's will on the world.<p>When parents say things like 'I love my kid so much that it makes my heart hurt', they aren't being flowery; that's actually what it feels like. A feeling so grounded in the core of our existence as a species that it's inseparable from physical pain; to try and apply rationality to that is the height of naivety. Likewise, when people say things like 'you can't understand unless you've had a child yourself', they aren't being dismissive. Parenthood isn't just another mouth to feed or diapers to change. <i>It is a rewiring of your mind and your soul so complete and severe that it can turn love into physical pain</i>. It is perhaps the most human event that has ever occurred in my life, and I suspect most other parents would say the same.<p>I have weeped openly for days in both happiness and fear for my daughter's well being. I have walked away from a life that took me a decade to build in order to ensure her health, and I never once questioned the correctness of that decision. Many of my decisions as a parent have  been made in the face of rationality, made on a balance of many factors of which the rational course of action was just one. Walking that razor edge between the rational way and the biological imperative is an essential skill of any parent. It is a path impossible to describe yet clear as day if you just know where to look.<p>The only objective truth is that there are no objective truths. I won't pretend to say that my perspective is any more or less correct than anyone else's, but I will say this: rationality is a double edged sword. It is a potent weapon against bugs, suits, and dogma, but it is also capable of separating you from that which makes you human. Like any tool, it's up to you to decide how to wield rationality. Please just know the consequences before you start swinging it.",1338319924

Unless the tool in question is <i>really</i> narrow in scope, there is not single ""best"" solution to any particular problem.<p>Also, I never did understand the aversion (usually coupled with condescending comments like your ""I'm not 15 any more"", implying those who <i>do</i> configure tools to be immature) to tweaking tools. Setting my environment up is a one-time affair: I sit down for a weekend, get my computer working exactly the way I want, and I'm set.<p>The productivity benefits (and, at least for me, they are <i>significant</i>), are not one-time: they scale with however much work I do. The difference, of course, is that the benefits are less obvious than the time spent to get them. The only reason I'm well aware of them is that I've used both a nicely customized system and (for school) a horribly inflexible Mac OS system at the same time. Throughout the year, the difference between the two became more and more annoying until I was just gave up and did most of my work at home.<p>So really, the cost to customizing a system is O(1); the benefits are O(n). Unless the constants are very high (e.g. modifying the kernel for my own use would just take too long) or you don't plan on using a tool too much, optimizing it <i>makes sense</i>.<p>Coincidentally, while I've never seen anyone <i>customizing</i> a hammer (it's a rather simple tool which, chance are, you don't use <i>that</i> much or for too many different things), people <i>do</i> customize things like tool boxes for a very good reason: they're moderately complex and having everything organized the way you like makes you much more productive.<p>Additionally, I find another benefit to modifying my tools myself: it's much easier to remember my additions than even equivalent features that come standard with the system. I have added a whole bunch of useful commands to Emacs that save me quite a bit of work, and I did not have to spend <i>any</i> time remembering the new key sequences because I was the one who came up with them in the first place. Even if those features existed and were on by default, it would probably have been easier to set my own key commands for them.<p>In short: while it's fair to expect software to ""just work"", it is not fair to expect it to work optimally or even well for every case and every person. And customizing your own tools (which is one of the things I think it takes to be a ""power user"", rather than sheer quantity of use) really can make you more productive, even taking in the time needed to actually customize them.",1338319682

Your ideal is simply unsustainable and impossible.<p>First: Are you married now (or have you been) and do you have kids? I'll assume you are married/committed but I'm not sure you are a parent, given your views. This is a tremendously important point to help frame this discussion. I fear you probably won't understand my points at all with out first hand experience.<p>What you are saying isn't technically wrong, but it requires precise compromise in order to be successful. That's exactly what jasonlotito is saying: You can't get what you want all the time, especially with your partner, most certainly with your children.<p>You and your partner need to understand, respect, and tolerate each other, first and foremost. Some people are simply incapable of doing this, period. Some people conflate this with making their life completely about the other person. Both of these people will be miserable regardless. For the rest of us though, simply understanding that statement means the marriage is a compromise - sometimes you get your way and your partner tolerates, sometimes you tolerate and your partner gets to do their thing, most often you are both getting your ways, as they are the same, but sometimes both of you are tolerating, for the good of the family/marriage.<p>Of course, with children, that last point becomes a vast majority of your life. Kids are the centre of their worlds and don't really understand how to be anything else. It takes literally years to impact the knowledge that life is better when they look outwards towards others into their little heads. Until then, you and your partner will do a lot of tolerating in your lives. How well you can do this (and when not to) will pretty much define how successful a parent you will be. It's an approach governed by the exact opposite thoughts that you are presenting however: Child first, couple second, self last.<p>Be clear than I'm not suggesting your entire life should be one of self-sacrifice, That doesn't work either. But it must be the last of your concerns 90% of the time if you are to make raising kids and marriage - especially marriage - work. Ensure the kids are alright (not necessarily that they get their way all the time), ensure your spouse is alright (happy wife, happy life after all) and ensure you are alright in that order, and you have a winning formula.<p>Looking out for yourself first is a guaranteed path to conflict. It's very rare that you can do this and remain in sync with other people, even best friends and spouses aren't going to want to do the same things all the time. Your children will <i>never</i> want to do the same things as you in any consistent fashion, which is way most happy family spend time in parks during the day as opposed to bars late at night.",1338318650

Her partner gave me completely wrong information; he didn't even know how to treat what I had.

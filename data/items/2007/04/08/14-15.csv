OLE for windowed environments is the same as the streams/pipes philosophy in UNIX. In fact OLE/COM is something that's still missing in UNIX (and don't tell me about gtk which is a shitty and buggy piece of software).<p>From GUI perspective MS did a lot of things that X and MacOS ""adopted"" or tried to adopt silently, so to say. <p>After all, MS does hire talented staff. Just don't underestimate them.",1176044199

Users pretty much don't care what the file extension of the page is serving up their content, they just want it to work. I can develop develop rich UI pages with the MS AJAX controls very easily and users are happy.<p>As a developer, working in the open source, 5 billion different products in various stages of non-existant support and working in a single consistent framework with fabulous support, it isn't a difficult decision which way to go... Unless you are one of those ""software tools should be free"" kind of people who doesn't mind not getting paid either.\n",1176044165

Walt Disney couldn't make it on his own, knew this and got his brother Roy out of hospital (!) to work with him. Roy outlived Walt. Walt painted castles in the air, Roy built the (economic) foundations. \n= Co-founder good, Creative+Executor great :-)\n= There has to be real trust/loyalty between the founders. With enormous wealth on offer, enough people go crazy & try to take it all. A partner you don't know well can take you down easily.<p>4. 'Founders', a.k.a. entrepeneurs, are more willing to take <i>risk</i> than most people - which means they get pretty comfortable with failure. They are also a special breed.\n= Comfort is the enemy of Change.\n= Change is Risk, but the only way forward.\n= Comfortable people won't pursue a startup vigorously...<p>5. How do you get your Founders to ""put skin in the game""? To have a personal stake in the outcome? (Besides losing their dream - or is that generally enough?)<p>6. One of the most important personal traits of a great entrepeneur - keeping a journal... Gotta write everything down. Crops up repeatedly in biographies. Richard Branson is quite clear about it - but doesn't relate it to his success. There is supposedly some research that says 1.5-3% of all people write down their goals. Once there was a long-term Ivy League school study (is this apocryphal?) showing that people who wrote down their goals out-performed others by 5:1 or 10:1<p>7. People are different. Some are shy/introvert, many extrovert. Shy people don't sift through the large numbers needed to establish 'good networks' and check-out who'd make a good partner.\nMany of the best geeks are quiet & retiring folk. They will, by definition, find it hard or impossible to bring along a partner. But forcing someone on them won't work either.\nThis is a hard problem to solve.\n= A solution is something like your ""Startup School"", but a little more frequent, to provide a mileu in which these people can mix and hook up. [As conferences and User Groups can do.]<p>[For a great example of this, see how Paul Allen was treated by Bill Gates and Steve Balmer on his last project at Microsoft.]<p>8. The Internet changes everything. But the VC process is still face-to-face personal contact... Silicon Valley was caused by VC firms like ""Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers"" bringing money from The East into technology. Even with the hordes of imititors and rip-off merchants, greedy investors flocked and made out well...\nBecause the place had critical mass - in people and places to meet, and the culture to support it.\nThese comments are peppered with genuine frustration (& longing) from would-be entrepeneurs.\n= How can the Internet overcome this tyranny?\n= Business is about personal relationships. Can the Net ever replace or augment that critical factor?<p>9. Technology support. Finding someone who is fluent with a key technology, like hardware hacking, can be critical to the success of a project/startup. When it's not your field, how do you find a way in? Then how do you get taken seriously by an expert??<p>10. Scaling: small trials and growing entrepeneurs.\nMy belief is that good entrepeneurs are grown, not born. And that there are predictable growth stages for all companies.\nA wealthy friends' advice is: Never attempt anything more than 30% larger than you've done before.\n= Have you thought of building a process to train up entrepeneurs before they enter your funding process?\n= I'm thinking graduated funding levels, starting low ($10k) and in a couple of stages getting to $500k or so.<p>11. For solid research on what makes <i>great</i> employees, see Robert E Kelley's book ""How to be a Star Performer""\n[<a href=""http://www.kelleyideas.com/pages/howtobeastar.htm]"">http://www.kelleyideas.com/pages/howtobeastar.htm]</a>\nNumber One Quality: Initiative.\nSounds the same...<p>12. One of the prime causes of some recent major corporate collapses here in Australia was: ""Ignorance, Arrogance and Self-Delusion"". They are a powerful triplet that can't be broken through. Witness the non-musical entrants in ""American Idol"" who honestly believe they are brilliant.\n= How do you sort these out? They'll always have a high opinion of themselves, their abilities and a string of huge accomplishments.\n",1176043798

10439,comment,10439,9770,0,0,iamwil,,,"I'm a little bit surprised that pg posted this article at all.  It's probably a bad choice of words, as ""dead"" can mean lots of things other than what I think pg means: it's not as intimidating to startups as it use to be.  It will not be the source of technical innovation that attracts the best minds in the world, as it once was.<p>In any case, a couple days ago, I was on the john, reading Hackers and Painters, and there's a chapter on ""What you can't say"" dealing with controversial thoughts.  Apparently, this is one of them.  pg's advice in the end of the article was not to say anything at all, so you don't have to deal with bickering with others, and go about your merry way.<p>But then again, I don't see pg here in the trenches.  In fact, most of us have wasted our time (some more than others) posting 200+ posts here, instead of working on our startups.",1176043500

10437,comment,10437,9770,0,0,trek,,,"Microsoft recently came to my graduate school to recruit for user experience design and user experience research positions.  10 folks out of my program (about 25% of us) scored and interview.<p>Every single one of us had no intention of working for Microsoft and joked about it intensely.  Microsoft had be relegated to the realm of other boring places to do our type of work but that you interview at for practice (and, you know, just in case that job at google doesn't pan out).<p>In my interview, the topic of digg.com came up and neither interviewer had heard of them.  I said they were like a type of slahsdot, or maybe magnolia.  Never heard of those either I quipped ""oh, maybe you're not involve much in the web / web development world"".<p>""Actually, I'm one of the project managers for Internet Explorer.""<p>The interview went downhill, from Microsoft, from that point forward.  My heart wasn't even in it ""just in case"" anymore.<p>",1176043390
10436,comment,10436,9770,0,0,linuxiac,,,"Deep thoughts. Thanks for them.<p>Exeeding my goal since 1997, converting one computer and/or person each week to Open Source, usually GNU/Linux, but, have done some <i>BSD (yes, there are some 25 of them!), I am fighting the lock-in monopolism of BOTH Apple/Macintosh and the multiple convicted felon Microsoft.  <p>Major reasons people switch, from my experience:\n1. Simplicity of use - GNU/Linux and </i>BSD are immune to the ""114,000 Microsoft Virus Definitions"" and provide thousands of included applications: games, suites, browsers. <p>2. Users are tired of having to become a computer technician and spend 2 hours or more each week trying to clean or prevent Microsoft virus, trojan, malware infestations.<p>3. Disgruntled that Microsoft treats paying customers like criminals, but, now aware that convicted felons act that way, thus, WGA, and in Vista, corporate Microsoft spyware with a ""shutdown feature""!  Why would anyone accept this?<p>4. Realization that Microsoft and Mac will sell included free stuff, without proper conscience, and worry about the 'details' such as royalties, customer support, or customer satisfaction, ""later""!<p>5. Awareness that 15 day TRIAL WARE is NOT a selling point for new Dell, HP, Compaq, Gateway computers... it is a dis-incentive, thus the great migration to FOSS, where all the FREE software is self protecting, at no extra penalty to the customer. <p>Yeah, <a href=""http://distrowatch.com"">http://distrowatch.com</a> has it, and <a href=""http://livecdlist.com"">http://livecdlist.com</a> has it Live!",1176043226

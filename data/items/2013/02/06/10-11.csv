Let's set aside the brain stuff and do some simple math: you're going to live anywhere from three to seven decades after you reach 30, but only one decade of adulthood before. Therefore your have the opportunity to build a foundation for your life's happiness in your 20's. Economists have this notion called the ""discount rate"", which is the degree to which one favors instant gratification over greater long-term returns. The younger you are, the more biased towards long-term returns you should be, largely because you have a longer long-term to enjoy them in. This principle is just as true in life as in financial investing. Likewise, as in financial investing, it's prudent to take more risks while younger since you have more time to recover from them.<p>Of course, we say such things to comfort ourselves now. Advice is wasted on youth.",1360147983

5175778,comment,5174334,5175236,1,0,winter_blue,,,"> Go do some physics - then come back to me.<p>I've actually thought about this a long time ago -- back in high school, and came to the conclusion that if everything were to follow a certain set of ""laws"", then indeed free will wouldn't exist.<p>But that isn't the case. Have you heard of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle for starters? If not, look more deeply into physics. After a certain point, the ""laws"" stop governing, and probability takes over. Probability leaves room for multiple possiblities -- a.k.a. choice. I can't say an electron chooses to be at position X at time T, but I can say that the fact that you can't determine it's positions and that it does tend to be ""wherever it wants"" within a certain range, hints at something of the kind.

If you live in the online world of the Apple or Android forums (or even many tech sites/blogs), it would appear that computers are ""dead"" if you use them as an indication of usage.<p>However, in the real world outside of the forums that are enamored by the latest and greatest toys put out by tablet makers, I think their real world usage is far less than observed.<p>Me personally, I get annoyed at having to use my phone (Galaxy Nexus) or tablet (2 HP Touchpads and a Nexus 7) for more than just checking mail, sending short IMs or SMS, or quickly viewing a few web pages. Doing much beyond that just requires much more time than if I did it on a PC with a keyboard and mouse. Those devices are just a way to get by when I can't be at my computer versus a replacement. I really just have them for development, but they're also fun toys to hack around on.<p>The allure of 3 large monitors tied to a nice desktop PC is one that I don't think I can pull myself away from either for real work. Tablets for productivity just feel more like a form of masochism if one to use it to write code on even with options out there[1]. If i desperately need to do something right away, sure, but most of the time, my laptop is with me if I also have my tablet.  If I didn't have the tablets, I wouldn't miss them. They're just an expensive toy to me at least.<p>Unrelated to the above, but I think I would go for the Surface RT over the Pro now that it's been ""jailbroke""[2] so you can cross compile any opensource app for it[3] and many already have been compiled[4]. Battery life is better and if you're a developer or power user, you can have a ton of fun hacking around on it now that you can self sign and compiled native apps that aren't metro.<p>[1]<a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.ui"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.ui</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2092158"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2092158</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2096820"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2096820</a><p>[4]<a href=""http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2092348"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2092348</a>",1360147144

Both attack on a common problem, which is making discussion meaningful, but the context is widely different. HN isn't meant to be used as a forum, it is a news discussion board, topics loose relevancy after just a couple days. Try adding lots of value to a topic by posting a reply after 48 hours, chances are, almost no one will see it, and even less people will reply to it. Forums don't work that way, you get discussions in forums which can last sometimes even years.<p>And considering other forum options, Discourse has probably a killer feature, which is ""Best of"" a thread. Forums are horrible for documentation, after a meaningful discussion topics usually go dead, and if you want to read an old topic (but relevantt to you) with 500 pages (or even just 20), it is painful, you don't need to read every single comment, and Discourse's ""Best of"" will (should) fix that.

That's not the point of this post however.<p>I am currently on holidays in Europe and am spending a month in Ukraine. I can't even begin to describe how the people I've met and the conversions I've had with them have changed me. To sum it up briefly, Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Kiev looks like a modern European capital, and there is obviously money around judging by the number of luxury SUVs on the road. Yet $400/month is considered a good wage, unless one has the appropriate connections. In short, European costs of living coupled with developing world wages.<p>The post's ending about somehow giving back is what resonated most to me. When I was a student I was fortunate enough to have free time and the money to explore my outside interests; fast forward 4 years and I have taught myself Japanese to fluency and have lived in the country on 3 separate occasions. I've met a student here that who I see a lot of my self in, she gets top grades and has an inexplicable interest in Japan. It is her dream to work there and she studies the language in her spare time. The only difference is that she works a full time job to pay for her studies (unrelated to Japanese) which are also full time. The reality is that she doesn't have the free time I did to learn Japanese, let alone the funds to visit independently. It kills me inside knowing that two weeks of my salary would give her a year of free time and the same opportunity I had to pursue my interest in Japan.<p>There are a lot of posts below about how education could be a silver bullet. I know what has affected my life most, however, was the ability to pursue my own interests.<p>Competencies in any area will open doors, maybe not doors as wide as those available to programmers, but doors to better places none the less. In her case Japanese language competency would make her eligible for the MEXT scholarships paid for by the Japanese government.<p>Honestly, I have debated offering to loan her a year's salary to be paid back if and when it is ever convenient for her. My conclusion is that the same could also be used to sponsor a child through to high school, and something else tells me its just not the right thing to do. Yet I arrive at the same internal conflict that you do, how to give back after winning the lottery.<p>For the record there are no romantic interests at stake here.",1360146018

7450338,comment,7449422,7449422,1,0,analog31,,,"My side project is a simple and fairly specialized electronic gadget. I don&#x27;t pay myself a wage. I spent maybe a few months of sporadic evenings, and a few hundred dollars, to design and produce a half dozen prototypes that I gave away. My only hope had been to not lose my shirt. People who received those prototypes wrote favorable reviews on web forums -- a boon that I actually hadn&#x27;t anticipated.<p>A possible milestone for break-even was when I was able to use the same PayPal account for booking sales and for all of my business expenses. That took roughly another few months, so maybe nine months all told.<p>My biggest cost is my time, even if I don&#x27;t hang a number on it, because I&#x27;ve got a finite amount of it. I try to keep a running estimate of dollars profit per hour of work. To expand the business at this point, I have to let some older models slide into oblivion, and come up with something that can attract a higher price.",1395514675
7450337,comment,7449590,7450071,3,0,jervisfm,,,"Agreed. But in the mean time, I encourage everyone to inquire if their bank supports virtual Credit Cards. Sometimes they do but may not widely advertise it.<p>Using virtual cards provides you a fine level of control over various features of the credit card and also protects your real credit card number. One can set up time limits (expiry date), set a  monetary limit or make it a one time use card.<p>Virtual credit cards are also useful for dealing with service providers who make it hard to cancel their subscriptions (e.g. you have to call in and talk to a person to unsubscribe). With virtual credit cards, one can sign up freely and not have to worry about being continuously surreptitiously charged each month. Once the card expires or the transaction limit is exceeded, the service provider will be forced to close/suspend the account on their own.",1395514649

And Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t keep me from writing bad implementations. In fact it may make it worse: financial companies that move dollars have a high startup cost because of the regulatory work. Because it can no longer be two guys in a garage, it becomes more likely that the chain of people that they have to hire and speak to has at least one competent member.

7450327,comment,7449742,7450296,5,0,pasbesoin,,,"There is a hypocrisy.  Language about wanting &quot;educated&quot; workers who are &quot;empowered&quot; to solve problems.<p>The environment that is created and fostered is exactly the opposite.<p>I &quot;paid my dues&quot;.  I delivered, and exceeded -- as repeatedly acknowledged by my management.<p>Despite that, there was very limited acceptance of my input into what would make things better.<p>The problem with calling this a &quot;problem&quot;, is that it puts the finger right upon the hypocrisy of <i>ALL</i> this language and discussion.  Employers are saying one thing, and doing exactly the opposite.<p>My message to younger folks is precisely this:  <i>DON&#x27;T</i> buy in to <i>ANY</i> of today&#x27;s messaging.<p>If you don&#x27;t see concrete, useful <i>ACTIONS</i>, it is simply, as I said, &quot;bullshit&quot;.  End of story.<p>There:  I just saved you twenty years.<p>P.S.  And that means actions <i>NOW</i>.  Any and all language about what is to come?  Empty.  Just substitute a big NULL -- or perhaps even an error condition, if you perceive it may be part of an intentional effort to deceive that goes beyond just &quot;normal&quot; empty messaging.<p>P.P.S.  Despite the validity of what I&#x27;ve said (I think), I find my personal bitterness is again spilling over into my comments.  Time for another break from making them.<p>By the way, some of those &quot;menial&quot; tasks were -- of themselves and due to interactions with colleagues -- actually the more enjoyable parts of some jobs.<p>Too bad that so much of actually, physically &quot;getting the job done&quot; seems to be looked down on, these days.  Do it too much or too willingly, and you risk getting pigeon-holed as either too culpable/readily-exploitable or otherwise not... &quot;management material&quot;, for lack of a better expression for it.<p>P.P.S.  I meant to add that in my experience, some of the specific events described in the OP were actually for me some of the most depressing experiences:<p>Official &quot;parties&quot; and &quot;celebrations&quot; one attended because it was mandatory or expected, refreshments and other expenses were all &quot;budgeted&quot; in a rather obvious fashion, and conversation had little to go beyond work topics or the same conversation that was already happening cube-side and &quot;at the water coooler&quot;.<p>All the more sad when employees were expected to kick in to cover the expenses.<p>A genuine evening out that one paid for oneself and where one had some fun?  Fine.  These &quot;we&#x27;re going to celebrate now&quot; events -- not so much.<p>I guess some people enjoy them.  To me, much of it seemed terribly transparent and shallow.  For my part, I still tried to and mostly succeeded in being genuine during them.  But it was not that much &quot;fun&quot; and didn&#x27;t make me very &quot;happy&quot;, and because of my honesty often put me somewhat on the periphery, socially.<p>&quot;Forced conversation&quot;, as the alternative.

However, I was also running a failing dial-up Internet service business (a cousin of mine had gotten my parents to purchase it so I could run it and earn some money/learn a bit about business, which was cool during high school) and was trying to maintain a long-distance relationship (which ultimately failed) and working part-time in the dormitory computer lab.<p>Because of the relationship, and the stress of dealing with the business failing (and closing after my first semester in school) I ended up not doing too well my second semester and ultimately decided to come back home.<p>At the time, back in 2006, things were still in boom mode and there were lots of cool new developments coming up back in my small town so I saw this as an opportunity to do something to make my community a little bit better.<p>I didn&#x27;t necessarily want to continue with school (looking back, that was a pretty dumb thought) so I&#x27;m glad I followed my sister&#x27;s advice and enrolled for an online degree program and worked my butt off over the next year and a half (with my AP credit and the credit from my classes I did pass at Berkeley, along with CLEP Exams I took along the way to get out of certain requirements, I was able to finish my Bachelors, and have that all too important piece of paper, before I was 21).<p>During that time I was in school I had started up a new business hoping to do a bunch of web development for local business and start making an income I could live off of. After that didn&#x27;t really materialize I figured it&#x27;d be a good idea to start pursuing a &quot;real job&quot; where I could earn a regular salary I could depend on.<p>So months before I officially graduated I had started my job search in my local area. I blame most of this on luck, but I applied for a number of IT jobs, which I got &quot;Thank you for applying&quot; letters and a few web development jobs, but kept on getting rejection letters. I also ended up applying for a webmaster job at the local college in April 2007, but even though I kept on checking in each month, there wasn&#x27;t any movement on actually hiring anyone for months.<p>So in late 2007 or so I ended up releasing a site which I hoped would &quot;change things&quot; and raise a bunch of money for education by encouraging folks to purchase their online products through a non-profit which would be setup specifically to collect and then distribute affiliate fees earned by all of the local individuals that made their purchase through this site (as an example, you might click on the Amazon link on this site and then be taken onto the main Amazon site after that to do your regular shopping, but since you went through that non-profit&#x27;s site it would bring back a bit of that purchase to the community and I was hoping that money could go to paying for field trips for schools and other stuff that normally gets the ax because of budget cuts nowadays). I learned a few years later, but I guess that work is what eventually made the college move forward with looking at all of the applicants for that webmaster job and I impressed them enough in the interview that I was offered that position in early February 2008. That day I got that call that I was going to be hired is probably one of the happiest I can remember (it&#x27;s a good feeling to know that your hard work and talents are appreciated).<p>Those good feelings were tempered dramatically when the Friday before I was supposed to start working, my younger sister passed away in a car accident driving to her high school. Going through such a difficult time right when you begin working somewhere really showed me how much people care about each other down here and I really appreciated all of the support I received at my new workplace during those early days.<p>Over time, I&#x27;ve learned so much and each week and month most often has something new to work through that you didn&#x27;t know about before. I&#x27;m essentially self-taught in most everything related to programming I&#x27;ve accomplished since that first year at Berkeley, but it was a great foundation. However, if there&#x27;s one thing I have learned over these years is that there is so much I don&#x27;t know and which I would love to learn. The hard part is finding teachers, particularly where I live because we have no connection to startups that could teach us the wide variety of skills I&#x27;m always hearing about here on HN. I&#x27;m starting to get to the point where I&#x27;m just going to start learning some of this stuff on my own, but it&#x27;s hard to justify sometimes when your day job doesn&#x27;t necessarily need you to learn those things (it&#x27;s always an additional driver to know that this thing that I&#x27;m trying to learn is going to be directly applicable to work).<p>I have a small software business I work on some weekends, but it&#x27;s super small ($200-$300 which about $150 in overhead). One of my goals this year is to try and increase that amount (it&#x27;s been basically the same each month since I started it back in August 2010), not because I want it to replace my day job (if the business takes off that&#x27;d be wonderful of course, but I think I would still want to keep my day job and use that extra money to help my family or my community in some way).<p>I think the main thing you&#x27;re talking about though is that you yearn for something a bit more, and I can&#x27;t say that I don&#x27;t have those same wishes too. I&#x27;d love to work for a startup or a big company, but not necessarily because I think they&#x27;d be better than my current workplace, which is really great, but mainly because the types of problems would be different, there&#x27;d be more people I could learn from, and those sorts of things (additional learning opportunities).<p>As jawns mentioned, it has to do with your risk tolerance, and working for a good organization can be very good for you particularly when you&#x27;re just starting out. Gaining that experience is crucial to allowing you to continue getting positions at other organizations if you&#x27;re not happy with your current one. If creating/joining a startup sounds attractive to you, just try and make sure you think through all of the possibilities (I&#x27;m an optimist so I always think things will turn out great for my businesses, but after those past failures it does help make you a bit wiser...or at least more understanding of your own limitations as a business person, haha).<p>All the best and good luck for you in your career!",1395513922

7450281,comment,7449960,7449960,33,0,colmmacc,,,"I&#x27;ve implemented DNSSEC twice now, I&#x27;ve also implemented IPv6 several times - at various levels of the stack (including directly at layer 3) and have had a hand in two different SSL/TLS implementations. Having implemented each, I don&#x27;t think that DNSSEC is particularly difficult or error-prone compared to IPv6 or SSL - it&#x27;s probably far less complicated than both. The trickiest part of DNSSEC to get right is probably NSEC3 (on both the authoritative side and the validating side) and it&#x27;s not so bad if you brush up on trees and hashing.<p>But DNSSEC can still be very difficult to implement, not so much because of its inherent complexity, but because of a mismatch between assumptions the designers made and what real-world implementors require. Here&#x27;s a simple example; many DNS implementations for large service support &quot;m of n&quot; answers. E.g. you might have 100 IP addresses for a service, and the DNS implementation would choose say 8 IP addresses to hand-out.  The dogma of DNSSEC is that answers should be signed-offline, which is great for security, but it means that in cases like this that we&#x27;d have to deal with a combinatorial explosion and sign all 186 billion potential answers. We could also sign online, but doing expensive crypto in response to a DNS request isn&#x27;t very smart if you&#x27;d like to survive DDOS attacks. So implementers have to make trade-offs and add complexity to make things work.<p>DNS is also commonly used as a routing mechanism - but DNSSEC does nothing to validate that this routing is being handled correctly. Signed answers are replayable - so the answer that says &quot;You should go to the Dublin node&quot; can be fed to resolvers/clients that should really be routed to a different node. This can aid attacks higher up the protocol stack that depend on routing traffic along a path it can observed. Similarly, because DNSSEC queries happen in the plain, intermediaries can easily filter and drop particular queries which they don&#x27;t like.<p>Most bizarrely perhaps, is that DNSSEC provides no end-to-end security. Your browser or OS still communicates with your resolver using regular queries, relying on a single unauthenticated bit to &quot;request&quot; validation. It&#x27;s as if LAN/wifi-level abuse wasn&#x27;t a concern at all, or that public resolvers (like OpenDNS and Google Public DNS) didn&#x27;t exist.",1395513816

7450233,comment,7449728,7449728,2,0,CriticalSection,,,"I worked in IT, with no BSCS.  I took some college classes at nights and weekends while working.<p>When 2008 rolled around, I knew things were shaky at my company, but many companies I looked at had &quot;Required: BSCS&quot; or even when not, HR would grill me on college when I applied.  I began saving a lot.  I decided if I could find an equivalent or better job I&#x27;d leave, otherwise I&#x27;d take my chances - I had many months warning about the company and economy shakiness.  Finally at the end of 2008 I got severance (it was a big company) and unemployment.  I went back to school full time.<p>While at school, I learned how to program better and better.  I learned Java.  I took $100 of my money, sent $25 to Google and bought 6 months of web/email hosting with the other $75.  I began publishing Android apps.  After six months, one of my apps finally began doing well, and it has paid for itself ever since.<p>As far as my revenue, it has averaged $600 a week for the past few weeks.  My business expenses are negligible - about $35 a week, $25 of which is my cell phone bill which is not fully a business expense.  My non-recurring costs are when I pay for artwork or translations or ads.<p>My fall 2013 semester was academically tough (with my AI class only being one of the hard classes) so I did very little new work on my apps, just some minor maintenance, checking Nagios etc.  Sometimes I can do work during the semester, sometimes I can&#x27;t.  I wind up doing a lot of new work during winter breaks, and during those summers in which I did not take classes (some summers I do take classes - but there is a short break around those as well).<p>The general ideas floating around here on HN are good.  Paul Graham&#x27;s essays, the Lean Startup ideas of Eric Ries and all of that.<p>One major difference for me is I am not looking to build a billion dollar company that is initially desirable to invest in for angels and VCs.  I am doing a bootstrapped, lifestyle thing for now.  I&#x27;m happy with $600 a week, although I hope to push that up to $700 or $800, and then eventually to $2000 a week.  Once I get to $2000 a week, I&#x27;ll probably shift what I&#x27;m doing, and may take on a more long-term, ambitious project more in tune with what is discussed here.  For what I&#x27;m currently doing, pg&#x27;s &quot;Ramen Profitable&quot; essay is good.  &quot;Startup = Growth&quot; is good as well.  As well as other essays, posts, and blogs by others doing bootstrapped startups.<p>You talk about working part-time.  I started off taking four classes a semester, including a hard class in each semester.  Before doing my own apps, one semester I took a consulting gig, and stripped down to two classes - one hard, one easy.  It was not stripped down enough - I wound up having to drop the hard class, and the company said I was taking too long.<p>I also took a summer consulting gig and had no time at all to work on my apps.  It&#x27;s hard to juggle too many things.  One semester I could only get two easy classes registered, so I got a lot of app work done during the semester.<p>One problem with working for others is during go-go times like 1998-1999 there is a lot of work, but come 2001 or 2009, work dries up, especially if you have no college diploma.  I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;ve built up $30k in side income.  If it keeps building up, it might become all of my income.<p>On the other hand, as others have said, you learn things working at companies, technical and otherwise, meet people etc.  Some companies are just overflowing with cash.",1395513031

During university, I had a majorly carb based (very unhealthy as well) diet.  Across all three, when I finally had the money to buy good quality meat on a regular basis (3-4 times a week), I not only felt FAR better, but my rather light workout regimen (2 sessions a day, 3 reps of 30 set&#x27;s of a variety of free weight exercises), became FAR more effective.  I put on ~10-20 pounds within a few short months, and found myself far more capable in terms of both performing and recovering from the rather simple physical tasks I do as a sysadmin (staying on my feet most of the day, racking rather heavy servers)<p>Now, this is all anecdotal, I was just addressing that my body responded in a way that suggested that I did &quot;require&quot; the protein.<p>With regards to the more formal argument, I&#x27;d word it more that you put yourself more &quot;at risk&quot; for certain health hazards by cutting ANY core part of the diet out.  It&#x27;s certainly easy to prove meat is &quot;bad&quot; but most of the studies I had seen involved excessive consumption, which defaults back to the general statement of &quot;all things in moderation&quot;.  Do you have references that show the former (negative effects) without the latter? (ineffective dietary balance).<p>To summarize, I&#x27;d agree if we&#x27;re only talking in extremes, that it&#x27;s very easy to show that meat is bad.

That&#x27;s why at Facebook we spend a lot of our energy making our services and the whole internet safer and more secure. We encrypt communications, we use secure protocols for traffic, we encourage people to use multiple factors for authentication and we go out of our way to help fix issues we find in other people&#x27;s services.<p>The internet works because most people and companies do the same. We work together to create this secure environment and make our shared space even better for the world.<p>This is why I&#x27;ve been so confused and frustrated by the repeated reports of the behavior of the US government. When our engineers work tirelessly to improve security, we imagine we&#x27;re protecting you against criminals, not our own government.<p>The US government should be the champion for the internet, not a threat. They need to be much more transparent about what they&#x27;re doing, or otherwise people will believe the worst.<p>I&#x27;ve called President Obama to express my frustration over the damage the government is creating for all of our future. Unfortunately, it seems like it will take a very long time for true full reform.<p>So it&#x27;s up to us -- all of us -- to build the internet we want.

The first impression was not good - everything was just mud. Mud houses standing next to the muddy road. The only nice place with decent food was the house of a local Rinpoche. One day I was bored and I baked a simple cake. He tried it and said I should stay there.<p>I ended staying there for three months. Mud was just one face of the place. Sun, green grasslands and incredibly kind people the other one.<p>In the next village I met a young buddhist master who was working on establishing a home and school for orphans. Helping him gave me a real reason to stay longer. We ended up opening the school in 2006 and it is still going strong [1].<p>I published a book about it [2] in Slovenia and hopefully I&#x27;ll manage to do the English translation this or next year.<p>[1] <a href=""http://shechen-school.org/prva-stran/lang:en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shechen-school.org/prva-stran/lang:en</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.matjaztrontelj.si/vsebina"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matjaztrontelj.si/vsebina</a>",1395512357

This isn&#x27;t a &quot;maybe&quot;, this is absolute certainty: A rising Google upset the apple cart by offering more than those other companies were, and everyone else was sour that they&#x27;d have to start paying more to keep their employees. This agreement, without any doubt at all, took money out of the pockets of tech workers.<p>I&#x27;m generally a fan of Google, but I have a negative opinion of Eric Schmidt. So many times he says and does things that seem so fundamentally detached from real life.<p>EDIT: Just wanted to add that the hero of this story -- the only one who actually saw that it was wrong and probably illegal, was Edward Colligan, then the CEO of Palm - <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/02/19/court-documents-reveal-steve-jobs-blistering-threat-to-ceo-who-wouldnt-join-wage-fixing-cartel/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pando.com/2014/02/19/court-documents-reveal-steve-job...</a>",1395511292

For a long time it was officially unsupported; lately there is a footnote at the bottom of the advanced DNS options page to call tech support if you want to discuss using DNSSEC---although they&#x27;ll happily sell me an extended validation certificate....",1395511287

This is essentially the application of one very subjective morality over lexical sentiment and embodies the wider issue of offence.<p>Offence ultimately derives from intent and we, as the end user, don&#x27;t have intent inferred to us while reading code. It may be misguided for a developer to use &quot;faggot&quot; or &quot;bitch&quot; as a placeholder variable, but these make no implication of the developers sentiment or any wider statement about such respective issues.<p>In reality, the better solution is don&#x27;t use software you disagree with. If there is no better alternative, fork it and create a version you do agree with. That is the joy of open source.",1395511264
7450109,comment,7448632,7449949,2,0,weirdcat,,,"I think the whole discussion doesn&#x27;t lead anywhere. We&#x27;re trying to bend the ideas of self, continuity and sameness to our quite limited imagination.<p>Let&#x27;s take the teleportation example: my rebuilt self is just as much &quot;me&quot; as the original was (or still is, should the device keep it intact) -- all atoms are in exactly the same place, and what&#x27;s crucial, the memories and mental characteristics are preserved. It&#x27;s not my clone (where only the DNA is the same), it&#x27;s the <i></i>exact<i></i> replica. Doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s built from freshly assembled atoms, since our bodies continuously assimilate new atoms and shed old ones anyway. In that we&#x27;re more resembling a wave on the ocean than a Luke Skywalker&#x27;s lightsaber prop, where it actually counts that it&#x27;s the exact set of atoms that Mark Hamill wielded on set. If you care about memorabilia anyway.<p>The two existing duplicates of me are obviously not &quot;the same me&quot;, but nobody should expect them to be. They both are a continuation of myself. Like the aforementioned wave, I&#x27;m not my atoms and their configuration, I&#x27;m the continuity of their ever-changing state.<p>.......<p>When a cell divides, does it cease to exist? If so, at which point exactly? Are the two newly created cells the same cell as the one that was there before? Are they a half-cell each, even though they both are full cells now? Is one of them the original cell that gave half of its matter to create an offspring? Would everything be back to normal if one of them ate the other one and we could say that the original cell just performed a crazy transformation, but it&#x27;s still the same cell (the same atoms, chromosomes and all)?<p>These questions might seem reasonable, but I think they stem from our mistaken desire to qualify and label things. Still, the reality isn&#x27;t limited to our understanding of it.",1395511257

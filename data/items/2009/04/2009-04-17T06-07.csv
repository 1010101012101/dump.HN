566485,comment,565505,566330,0,0,mjfern,,,"I think you're making an interesting point. I wonder how many individuals that have achieved a high level of success in their careers (CEOs of Fortune 1000 companies, entrepreneurs of fast growth companies, etc.) have balanced that career success with a high level of achievement in their personal life (family and friendships). Can you manage to devote enough energy/time to work and life to achieve a high level of success in both? Is anyone aware of any role models?",1239951087

Besides BSoD's and key processes being hijacked, I can definitely say it does help keep the performance up.<p>It may slow down your PC initially, but it keeps the performance for life. You might have great performance after a fresh install, however it doesn't last for long.<p>Personally, I'd rather have a working PC than have to deal with a BSoD. I doubt I'd get many virus' and such as I don't download those kinds of files. However if you have a teenager in your family either whip them every time they try to touch a computer, but the way that's less likely to end in your incarceration is installing virus software.<p>The choice is prevent or protect, and I'm guessing many people here could prevent through their browsing behavior, I doubt the same could be said for any 12-16 year olds.",1239950965

I guess I was not aware that it was discretionary to the jailers; with that in mind I can see how it could be used as a weapon, a torment, not necessarily associated with the original sentence commensurate to some crime.  Where there is no accountability, there is often abuse, and my earlier comment that criminals 'should' (sorry...) consider it as a potential consequence was predicated on measured and accounted application.

566469,comment,565206,566100,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I read 1:6 (O-3:O-6) is supposedly balanced, no ill effect or positive effects. 1:4 is considered good, but aiming for a 1:1 is definitely a good target.<p>The thing I find most disturbing is that omega-6 can replace monounsaturated fats in your skin and could significantly increase your risk of cancer. I'm unsure of how exactly, but the polyunsaturated fats increase the free radical production, where as monounsaturated and saturated fats can prevent it. Not to mention polyunsaturated fats might inhibit vitamin D production.<p>Another thing to consider, omega-6 can inhibit your immune system, which further increases your risk of cancer. It just kicks you when you're down, not only can O-6 cause cancer, but it can stop your body fighting it too.",1239949475

566463,comment,566365,566365,0,0,tripngroove,,,"""creativity"" is all about process. come up with methods for putting ideas / objects / anything together and when you have a whole series, pick the ones that are most intriguing and run with them.<p>it's a tough sell to imply that any product, any idea, or any thing is creative in the sense that it appeared out of some sort of magical, big-bang of inspiration. your brain works by building connections, so anything you build is going to be an expression of everything you know; it's just a matter of not being afraid to experiment, and of iterating as fast as possible to find combinations of ideas virulent enough to claw their way above the slew and become something special.<p>and the energy you spend searching, identifying and implementing those combinations of ideas is directly related to the likelihood of their success... however you choose to define it.<p>don't be afraid to fail. by failing you're educating yourself about what doesn't work, which, in turn, makes it easier to identify what will.<p>also, when you're trying to be creative, the easiest way to fail is to not do anything at all. it's too easy to cogitate endlessly about what good solutions COULD be, rather than taking real steps to implement and identify what good solutions ARE.<p>i'd go with nike...

566452,comment,566086,566086,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Having worked as a reviewer for 3 years, my personal opinion is that it definitely didn't help that no truly good games came out this March.<p>The only actual new game (not a sequel) that appeared to be good to me was H.A.W.X.. However, from the demo I couldn't say higher than an 8/10.<p>Resident Evil has always done reasonably well, however I've never liked the series. Empire: Total War interests me, but I gave up on trying to follow PC games after the whole DX10 only games and now they're bringing out D3D11! That leaves GTA: Chinatown; I'd be interested in Pokemon Platinum, but these ones always feel like such a cheat.<p>This leaves the only games I'd have bought as H.A.W.X. (not at $70 for a game I don't trust to be amazing) and a DS game.<p>It doesn't help that prices of some of the big games haven't dropped in over 6 months from their original release price. Hopefully the recession and now this huge drop in games sales might get them to drop the prices of games to get their sales up. What seriously pissed me off was when the recession started, Fallout 3 went <i>up</i> in price.",1239948138

It forces the argument just deep enough to go three nodes into the list spine. Then, picks the branch based on the number items in the list, forces the first element of the list, and sets up a thunk for appending everything on later.<p>This was a little bit of a simplification of things; I don't need to go into great detail to make my point.",1239948088

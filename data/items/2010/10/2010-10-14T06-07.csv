1790077,comment,1788558,1788558,0,0,nkurz,,,"I agree with most of the points in the article, but I'd point most of the blame on the rise of the Mobile Apps. Those who would have been the next generation of open source programmers are instead releasing closed source apps.  Some of the reasons are the same as Zed points out (lower bar for 'making a company out of it') but some of the direction comes from the corporations backing the App Stores and selling the mobile devices.<p>For many common tasks, there are a plethora of Apps out there the do pretty much the same simple thing, in a mostly functional but considerably klunky manner.  In the open source world, one of these would take the lead, incorporate the best features of the competitors, and then developers would pitch their efforts behind the winner increasing the lead even farther.  Instead, every week there's a new closed-source work-alike.<p>It feels like a regression back to the pre-open-source days of shareware. Instead of a pooling of efforts, everyone is duplicating the work that's already been done.  Instead of building a solid foundation, there's a glorification of throwing something together in an afternoon from ""premade parts"" and ""stock libraries"" --- perhaps they grow on trees --- and putting it out there for sale.<p>Android is considered the more open environment, but on my Linux based Android phone, I don't know if there are any open-source Apps that I use --- maybe the Camera is stock?  In contrast, on my desktop (also Linux) I can't offhand think of any programs I use regularly that aren't open source (I guess Flash, if you count it as a program).<p>I don't think this is by accident.  Why for example does Google have such a lousy closed-source email App?  I feel certain a forked open-sourced version would be vastly improved within weeks, and anyone who didn't think so would still be free to use the original.  Believe it or not, it's actually reasonably common practice to disassemble an App like this to byte code, and then try to patch this and reassemble it into a working App.  (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/smali"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/smali</a>)<p>At one point I thought it was the phone companies that were setting this course, but now I'm not so sure.  Microsoft tried to kill off open source through FUD and marketing, but surprisingly they didn't have the clout.  But now Apple and Google might just kill it off by creating a thriving business for 99 cent Apps --- because who's going to release the source for a whole afternoon's work when someone might just steal it and put a closed-source version up on the App store and maybe become a millionaire?",1287039348

The last hundred years of discourse on philosophical logic have been focused on one thing -- to formalize the human notion of implication better than material implication does.

A thousand isn't a lot, but it is easily done in a few hours.<p><i>If they are paying commodity prices, then you give them a commodity.</i><p>The key? Boiler - Plate. Have a standard contract. Have a standard website theme, perhaps with multiple skins. Make it easy for them to enter their own content. You can build a decent CMS in a few hours or a great CMS in 10-15 (for clients like this that don't need extensibility). Amortize it over the 5-10 websites you're selling each week and you're time costs go down drastically.<p>I stumbled onto this strategy accidentally.<p><i>I had nothing else to do for a few hours.</i><p>My BATNA was earn $0/hour. I wasn't going to let my pride get in the way of easy money.<p>So I took a small ""build me a website"" job. Knowing they had small requirements, it was easily done in a few hours. I kept getting more requests, I kept sending out virtually the same website, over and over. I was getting them onto the host I use also and making an additional $50-$100 for each client as well.<p>Eventually it was only a matter of explaining how hosting works and how to add new pages and content. After the 30-45 minute explanation, it was coming out to move like $400/hour rather than $200 for a website.<p>Big Tip: Record your phone calls and meetings when you're explaining how hosting works and how to work your CMS. Go over what you said each time and work to actively improve it. Take 30 minutes, record screen capture videos with voice over. Give these to the client when you give them the minor training required.",1287036436

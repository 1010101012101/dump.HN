As a result a lot of crap gets funded early.<p>But VCs still play at the bigger level for more money and most of these me-too startups that get their million dollars go nowhere and get no follow on funding and die.  The bubble of seed will eventually go away as these angels realize that investing is hard and they have better things to spend their money on.<p>As someone who has been involved in a billion dollar project that required up front investment of around $250million I can tell you that finding very large sums of investment for capital intensive businesses with good return metrics is not hard - there&#x27;s a lot of money that at that scale only has limited options for putting it in play.

That&#x27;s why learning from books that are very formal is such a difficult experience, though it gets easier with experience.

Dr. Drang seemed more bothered by the fact that they were there because it was too amateur, and too much pretty graphs for their own sake, since any civil engineer could do the calculations in their sleep. Not because of technical problems, per se. (Honestly, that might be a social faux pas among physical engineers, and a noob move from Musk, but I&#x27;m not a civil engineer nor Musk so I don&#x27;t give a shit.)<p>Apart from that, it <i>seems</i>, as I gathered from comments here, that there was a solution to thermal expansion, and that&#x27;s both not fixing the tube to the pylons, and <i>having the trajectory curve</i> so they can bend safely under expansion. This confusion rose from the ambiguous meaning of &quot;nearly straight tube&quot;. The Hyperloop seems to have decent tolerances for turning, so maybe that could work.<p>But the most solid arguments against Hyperloop, I think, come from the economics side. It&#x27;s less efficient than a <i>good</i> HSR, like the French or the Japanese ones. It&#x27;s not SF to LA, it&#x27;s &quot;somewhere near SF&quot; to &quot;somewhere near LA&quot;.

Some ISPs have their DHCP server assign IPs according to the MAC address of the cable modem, which of course won&#x27;t change if power is shut off and then turned on again.<p>My ISP does this.  I get a new IP address whenever
I cycle power on my cable modem.  And sometimes 
my ISP gives me a new IP address for whatever reason.
Maybe their reason is that they want to charge
a little more for a fixed IP address.  Or maybe
they have more paying customers than IP addresses
so must dynamically assign IP addresses to
users actually connected.<p>Yes, if 3taps was accessing Craigslist from
a fixed IP address, then that can be fair,
although not really good, evidence that
3taps was continuing to access Craigslist
after the C&D letter.<p>If 3taps just admitted continuing to use
Craigslist, then they were, just how do I
say it, s.t.u.p.i.d, or some such?  Or,
all a 3taps person had to do was just
go home and get the Craigslist data
from a home computer with a different
IP address.  I&#x27;m not up on mobile devices,

also use frequently changing,
dynamically assigned IP addresses.<p>Also I don&#x27;t like the idea that
there is <i>screen scraping</i> as something
different from ordinary usage;
it&#x27;s not.  The Web site sends the data,
and the data is nearly always stored
on disk by the Web browser.  Also
the Web browser can write the data
to an HTM file and a directory with
the JS, CSS, JPG, PNG, GIF, etc. files.
Then the user has essentially all the
data in simple, plain unencrypted
form.  Nearly all the data is sent
just as simple text.  E.g., likely
the Craigslist data is sent this way.
Then if someone wants to make some
new use of that Craigslist data, 
they can easily remove the HTTP, HTML,
CSS, JS, etc. stuff, leave the simple
text, analyze it, reformat it, 
combine it with other data,
format it with Word, TeX,
PostScript, PDF, etc., wrap it in some
new HTML, CSS, and JS, and publish it
again.  Then it need not be the least
bit clear just where the data came
from.  In this case, with little
good evidence that the data came
from Craigslist,
it would not be
fair to search the facilities of
3taps for evidence.<p>Broadly, the Web site offers the data
to all anonymous users, as mostly just
simple text.  In that case, the Web site
should basically just shut up about
what happens to the data they sent.",1376931021

I actually think this is an elaborate marketing move.  Not much Tesla news lately.<p>While I don&#x27;t have a PhD in Physics, I do have a PhD in Having Designed and Built Lots of Shit.  I have touched enough disciplines outside of my EE training to have a pretty good reality meter when it comes to engineering.<p>Thermal expansion, earthquake survivability, cost and plausibility were probably the first few issues that stood out to me.<p>Thermal expansion is a huge problem.  It is also a first year college physics problem.<p>What is not mentioned in this article is thermal shrinking!  I am surprised the author did not focus on that a bit.<p>And then there&#x27;s the more complicated problem of differential thermal effects.  Put another way, you can have a portion of the tube pushing while another portion would is pulling.<p>The bottom line is that there&#x27;s a need for tube-to-tube gaps bridged with compliant material.  This would localize thermal effects to a single tube and prevent propagation up and down the system.  Welding is out of the question.<p>The superficial treatment of earthquakes is also of concern.  Many years ago I devoted a non-trivial amount of time to understanding earthquake physics because of a large project I was heading that required earthquake survivability.  I learned just how serious these events can be.  There are at least four effects to deal with: ground acceleration, structure resonance, amplification of acceleration magnitude within structures (resonant &quot;snap&quot;).  This isn&#x27;t the right venue to discuss this at length.  You&#x27;d have to design for ground accelerations in excess of 5 g, ground displacement in the one to five meter range and &quot;snap&quot; accelerations in the 10 to 50 g range (guessing the high end).  And do so for six degrees of freedom (xyz and the respective rotations).<p>Just yesterday I drove along a 100 mile stretch of the Golden State freeway.

No need to deliver anything real.

This only drops to 5 m/s^2 after perfectly canting the track, converting the downward 9.8 m/s^2 gravity and the sideways acceleration into a single 14.8 m/s^2 acceleration vector downward in the plane of the capsule floor, or 5 m/s^2 more than passengers are used to. This is worse than sideways acceleration: track standards for vertical acceleration are tighter than for horizontal acceleration, about 0.5-0.67 m/s^2, one tenth to one seventh what Musk wants to subject his passengers to. Its not transportation; its a barf ride.<p>The barf ride that is as expensive as California HSR and takes as long door-to-door is also very low-capacity.(...)

Acting as a critic helps Musk in his noble quest.<p>I have enjoyed the Hyperloop discussion as a thought experiment, and I appreciate that Musk is willing to throw around crazy ideas that challenge conventional thinking.<p>Regarding thermal expansion, the change in length must be dissipated through the curves and changes in vertical alignment. The hyperloop is mostly straight, not perfectly. Oil and gas pipelines are almost perfectly straight, thus needing an expansion bend. The Hyperloop changes bearing frequently. Being mostly straight is a major item to overlook, as any pylon near any change in direction will have to deal with thermal expansion, not the end tubes. A 20 mile arc with a 20 mile radius will absorb a significant change in tube length with only modest pylon deflection. Musk&#x27;s pylons could handle the strain with smart structural engineering. At a glance, I would design the pylons to pivot on a hinge portion with pretensioned steel and (viscous fluid) dampers to control vibration, letting the tubes push the pylons to modestly reduce or increase the curve radii. The major difference in Musk&#x27;s design is that the tube would need to be periodically anchored in various dimensions to discourage the end-station movement and force the tubes to use the pylons&#x27; flex rather than snaking the whole length of tube.",1376929478

6237948,comment,6235034,6237254,1,0,graycat,,,"I did read the article.  The article
and the legal thinking are badly 
confused and, really, nonsense.<p>Why?  The main reason why and 
my point in my post is that blocking the IP address
is just silly talk since an IP address can&#x27;t
be used at all reliably to identify a
computer or user.  The IP address is 
nearly irrelevant.<p>The Web site might as well find that the
person, say, Tom, they didn&#x27;t like
ate at McDonald&#x27;s and then try to block
everyone who eats at McDonald&#x27;s.  Then
Tom can eat at Wendy&#x27;s, and everyone
who does continue to eat at McDonald&#x27;s
gets blocked and maybe accused of violating
the C&D letter.  Again, once again,
over again, yet again, IP address just
says next to nothing about who 
did or did not connect to the Web site.
So, IP address should be ignored in
this legal discussion.<p>Away from McDonald&#x27;s and more specifically
about the Internet, 
(1) The user who got
the C&D letter could just use a different
IP address.  One way to do that is to us
a proxy as in the article.  Another way
is just to disconnect the electrical power
from a cable modem and connect power 
again.  Then the modem will likely forget the
IP address it was last assigned, use
the internet standard <i>dynamic host
connection protocol</i> (DHCP) to get another
IP address from the Internet service
provider (ISP), and continue on.  Another
way is, the ISP can just assign a 
different IP address at any time for
any reason.  So, the person, Tom, who received
the C&D letter can get a new IP address
and, indeed, be forced to give up his old
IP address.  And the user, Tom, need not
even be aware of this change in IP address.<p>(2) The Web site could get torqued
at the wrong person.  So, the ISP
of the person receiving the C&D letter, Tom,
could assign the the IP address
blocked by the Web site to another
person, Joe, not involved in any of 
the legal efforts, and Tom could try to connect
to the Web site.  Then the Web site could
blame Tom for access to their site by Joe.
Bummer for Joe.<p>For your<p>> just see if 3taps has data from the craigslist website that was after the effective date of the IP block<p>that&#x27;s not nearly &quot;easy enough&quot;.  Even to start to
look for this data, need full access to at least
the computer of the person who got the C&D letter,
Tom.<p>So, have to grab Tom&#x27;s computer.  By what right?
Tom can claim that he has been honoring the C&D letter and
not been accessing the
Web site and that the blocked IP address has
been assigned to someone else, Joe.<p>Even if get Tom&#x27;s computer, now what?  He could
have several trillion bytes of data on his computer,
and also have other computers in his house/office.
Looking for the Craigslist data could be a lot
of work and very intrusive, whether Tom
had the data or not.  The search could
uncover business plans, love letters,
etc. Tom should be able to keep private.<p>The Craigslist data could be anywhere in that data
or nowhere.  The data could be encrypted.  Tom
might have copied the data to DVD and hidden it
in the bottom of his kitty cat&#x27;s litter box,
under insulation in his attic, in one of
several hundred books on his bookshelf, etc.
Pawing through all of Tom&#x27;s private 
possessions all based in IP address or less
is outrageously intrusive and wildly unfair to Tom.<p>Next, it need not be the least bit clear
in what form the data is.  The data, as
sent by Craigslist, is essentially just
simple text plus maybe some pictures in
JPG, GIF, PNG, etc.  A lot of that text
data is HTTP, HTML, and CSS tokens,
symbols, and markup that has next to
nothing to do with the Craigslist data
at issue;
those tokens, etc. can easily be
removed by a simple program or text
editor leaving just the data.
That data can be pulled into 
a spreadsheet, written to a database
(e.g., SQL Server or MySql), 
combined with other data in 
files, tables, etc., graphed,
formatted with TeX, PostScript,
PDF, etc., and look nothing much
like a Web page from Craigslist.
So, turning Tom&#x27;s house upside down
promises to uncover nothing relevant
to the C&D letter.<p>Since maybe Tom is honoring the C&D letter,
turning his house upside down 
is not justified by any evidence and
is unfair to Tom.<p>Moreover, maybe Tom got the Craigslist
data from, say, a Google archived
copy or a friend or another Web site.<p>&quot;Easy enough&quot; is a very long way from
being true:  It&#x27;s easy for Tom
to have what looks like Craigslist
data when he did honor the C&D letter.
It&#x27;s easy for Tom not to have honored
the C&D letter and have some Craigslist
data but be next to impossible to
know this, no matter what devastation 
is inflicted on Tom&#x27;s house or office.<p>More generally, the Web site is volunteering 
to send its data over the Internet to
computers and software that request the
data via a HTTP GET request.  About all
the Web site knows is that there was
a GET request from an IP address;
neither the GET request nor the IP
address say anything meaningful
about a person.  It&#x27;s not the least
bit clear who the person is.
That&#x27;s just how the
Internet works.  If the Web site doesn&#x27;t
like that, then they can shut down.<p>So, really, the Web site can send all
the letters they want, but they have
no evidence that should justify
searching what data Tom has or if
Tom did or did not honor the C&D letter.<p>The Web site effectively put the data
out there in <i>the public square</i>
for everyone, anonymously, 
to see, copy, keep, and in 
some, and maybe all, respects use.  Then later
the Web site changed their mind and
wants some absurd restrictions based
on some nearly meaningless evidence.
The data is offered to anonymous users,
and it is not clear just who the users
are, and no amount of C&D letter
writing and IP address tracking, etc.
can change that.",1376928298

From my limited vantage point, I think what is happening is not just an alteration of time preferences (time horizon) for capital-intensive projects, but an aversion that leads to an alteration of the &quot;risk horizon&quot; as well.<p>Where is our generation&#x27;s Hoover Dam? Or Manhattan Project? Or reaching further back in time, where is our Age of Exploration if you are into more private venture-backed efforts?

Our state-of-art in residential shelter have major subsystems that are still largely recognizable to someone from a century and a half ago; where is the work on cheap aerogel SIPs, more self-maintaining homes, lower energy footprint communities? Why are we generating a giant pile of waste BTUs from air conditioners and not recapturing that back into our water heaters? There appears to be a large disconnect between what we as a civilization know and what we deploy (my personal theory is this has something to do with available energy).<p>It is not clear to me that all those PE and corporate attorneys are actually allocating capital in the furtherance of general comfort for all, but rather instead they appear to be mini-max&#x27;ing for their interests at the relative expense of slowing our current state of advancement.

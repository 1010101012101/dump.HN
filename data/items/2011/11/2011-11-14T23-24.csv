So here's what I was thinking (but please feel free to add your thoughts): 1) Just before you eat anything, send an SMS with a list of what you are about to eat and get an estimated calory could back instantly via SMS. 2) Get an end of day SMS with total ""theoretical"" weight gain/loss for the day.<p>What else should such a tool have?",1321315193

3236244,comment,3236161,3236161,1,0,libraryatnight,,,"As someone fairly overweight, I'm totally aware of all the resources available to me should I want to lose weight (I have a fitocracy account currently, I used to do Weight Watchers -- which worked -- and others)<p>I am still overweight because I love to eat, I know what needs to be done and I do not care. I'd rather be plump and have a carne asada burrito tonight than thin and have a properly portioned meal and well reasoned meal.<p>It's also much easier to get a carne asada burrito, or order a pizza, because my life is busy and easy where I can get it is appealing. When it's not busy I eat much nicer meals, but no less rich in calories. I do at least make sure I eat lots of veggies and fruits, but I also have a bag of salt & vinegar chips I know I'll tackle late in the evening when everyone has gone to bed.<p>A few years ago I did lose weight, about 100lbs, and it happened because I woke up one morning and decided I needed a change. I focused hard on monitoring what I ate, I used weight watcher's point system at first then figured out in general what was going on there and used my own tracking system and spreadsheets. And after seeing results for weeks and months, I stopped paying attention. I still monitor, but not as much.<p>My point is that people, at least a good portion of people, understand what is necessary to lose weight. It's making a significant life change that's difficult. People may or may not come to the point where that change is something they're going to make. When they make that decision, that's when good tools can help.<p>So don't make a tool thinking it'll convince people to lose weight, make a tool that works well for people who truly want to lose weight.",1321314891

3236217,comment,3236161,3236161,0,0,byoung2,,,"<i>Isn't it obvious that you will not lose weight unless you eat [fewer] calories than what you burn?</i><p>Yes, it is obvious.  Losing weight is a simple mathematical equation.  Burn 2500 calories a day, and eat 2000, and every week you will lose 1 pound (1 pound ~ 3500 calories).  The difficult part is making it happen on a daily basis.  Say your body burns 2200 calories a day...can you squeeze in 45 minutes of intense cardio each day to burn another 300?  On top of that, can you restrict your calorie intake to 2000 when a typical fast food combo is 1100 calories and a Starbucks latte is 190?  There is even a salad on CPK's menu that weighs in at a whopping 1800 calories.  I think the problem with losing weight, especially in the United States, is not a matter of math, it is a matter of discipline.  If you are American and you want to lose weight, I suggest moving to Japan.  I have been there twice, and I lose an average of 5 pounds a week there because of a diet heavy on rice and seafood, but with extremely small portions, lots of walking, dancing til 5am, and lots of pushing on crowded trains.",1321314261

I was smart at the time, and so I tended to spend most of my social time hanging out with folks who were 5-10 years older and absorbed a lot of culture from them. I've always identified more with the ""ideals"" of Generation X than with those of the Millenial generation or Generation Y. I'm cynical almost to a fault. I have extreme problems accepting un-earned authority, such that my wife said ""you just aren't meant to have a boss"" the other day. I really just want to be left alone to live my life in peace, like a less violent Daniel Plainview.<p>To get meta, I think that it's probably easiest to envision generations as phases of an ideological sine wave. At any given time, one set of ideas and culture - one phase - will be dominant and will contain most of the population. However, no phase ever dies out completely - there's always a few oddballs who will find medieval chivalry, for instance, appealing.

You just have to start with the right mindset.<p>How are you supposed to make a instant search usable without JS?<p>If it doesn't need to be instant, just normal search with a nice GET /search?q=border, one would have to program a server side script to do that search.<p>Or maybe you'd just want to show the whole reference on the HTML, then the JS would have to use that to do the search and hide/show the appropriate div, or you'd have to load everything twice (once in the HTML body and again via ajax). Even then, what's the point? It's a instant search. If the user can't use the only feature of it, he's better off googling.<p>Is there other way that I'm missing?

There is a huge gap between scaling your typical web app and running Amazon, Twitter, or Facebook.  Between the millions of small web apps out there and the few hundred that warrant setups written about on highscalability, there are sensible steps you can take toward scaling that involve sensible architecture choices, database structure and indexing, layers of caching, load balancing and failover, etc.  This is where the low hanging fruit is, and I think this is a good place to start.",1321311764

Yes, he did say those things, but I still say he didn't care jack about internet freedom, these were convenient rocks to throw at China. Any rock would have sufficed.<p>And if the administration's actions now don't reflect what was said before, it's just coincidence.<p>Did he actually take <i>action</i> at any time to defend internet freedom, or did he merely speak?<p>The administration today, and congress, are opposing internet freedom by their actions. An example for the administration is their defense of the law that says any email on an internet server older than six months is considered abandoned, and they therefore have a right to look at it without a warrant.<p>The only thing that counts for me is action, and that only lasts until the next hostile act.",1321311729

I feel like weve had that for a few years.<p>What might actually happen is that Git or Dropbox become the interface through which we put files on the web. Ones blog is just a subset of files that one is maintaining anyway.<p>Thats nice, and a consolidation of tools. But not, um, advanced.",1321311636

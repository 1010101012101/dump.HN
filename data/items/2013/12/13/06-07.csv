(A Hearst pattern, for those who aren&#x27;t well-versed in information retrieval, is like a linguistic template for IS-A relationships.  For example, if you see the text &quot;<person>, a <thing>, ...&quot; or &quot;<person> is a <thing>&quot; or &quot;<thing> <person> recently <verb>&quot;, you can be reasonably sure that <person> is a <thing>.)  In other words, if the press reports someone is a Google exec, they are almost certainly not a Google exec.<p>I&#x27;ve done a few spot checks and this seems to hold up.  Andy Rubin, Google&#x27;s Android executive until recently, is called an &quot;engineer&quot;, &quot;founder&quot;, and in one case &quot;head honcho&quot; in the press.  Larry and Sergey are usually called &quot;founders&quot;.  Amit Singhal, Google&#x27;s Search executive, is referred to as &quot;engineer&quot;, &quot;chief&quot;, and sometimes &quot;senior vice president&quot;.  Sundar Pichai is referred to as &quot;senior vice president&quot; and &quot;head of android and chrome&quot;.  Vic Gundotra and Susan Wojcicki each got one mention as &quot;Google exec&quot;, but are much more commonly titled &quot;senior vice president&quot; or &quot;head of social/ads & commerce&quot;.<p>By contrast, the people who are usually labeled &quot;executives&quot; in the press are often corporate attorneys, regional marketing managers, or mid-level ops managers.",1386917930

I understand the technical issue, but I&#x27;m sure when they get adopted by a wider and not-so-technical audience, they may become a target of a nasty class action lawsuit. For example, I bought several times Bitcoin with them, you see the price, then you get a popup to confirm (sometimes the popup shows a different price than what you originally got, but that&#x27;s fine as it&#x27;s confirmation page), you hit the button and guess what - after looking in your transaction history, you see you got charged sometimes tens, sometimes - hundreds of dollars more. Basically, the price moved, and they charged you a different amount. No warning, no nothing. Again, I understand why this is happening, but they make enough (1%) to honor the price. As I suspect, sometimes they sell from their own inventory of Bitcoins, so, they don&#x27;t depend on the market order.",1386917396

Therefore you should be able to master all 7 other languages in no more than 49 months which is about 4 years.<p>Of course, I don&#x27;t believe your numbers. You may have been able to master some commonly used bits of Python in 7 months, but it takes about 7 years to master anything. Programming languages are a bit of a special case because there is a lot of overlap so I think that Ruby would take an additional 2 years, but C would likely take another 5 years. Then 5 more for C++, 2 years for Objective-C, two for Javascript, two for PHP and another one year for GO.<p>Of course if you do it in a different order, the length of time would be different because spending less than 7 years to master something requires that you reuse a lot of existing knowledge.<p>In human language terms, for an English speaker to master French, Russian and Mandarin would take no less than 21 years. But for that same person to master French, Spanish and Italian would take about 12 years.<p>The best advice would be to not worry about any of this. Find a job that requires programming and learn whatever tech you need to use in that job. Then move on to another job that uses at least some different pieces. If you are not actually using a language to build real things then you won&#x27;t really learn it.",1386916610

6899372,comment,6893756,6893846,3,0,oakwhiz,,,"Well, if you think about it, pretty much every modern programming language has been shaped by people who also happen to eat meat. Therefore there will be systemic bias in nearly every programming language toward the &quot;meat-eating&quot; way of thinking, which oppresses vegans and gives meat eaters an unfair advantage when programming in those languages. There is no way to fully remove this bias other than to create a new programming language for vegans, by vegans.<p>For example, in a programming language like C++ or Java, one is not required to think about the consequences of their design decisions. It is possible to design an API in such a way that it causes harm to another person or program, for example not using type safety, or being vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. A vegan programming language would ostensibly prevent such harmful actions by way of its very grammatical and logical structure. It would be next to impossible to write a valid construction in a vegan programming language that causes harm, because you would be required to inform the compiler of your intent. Any such construction would simply be illogical, and cause an error to occur.<p>The differences between a vegan programming language and a non-vegan programming language could even be extended to include political correctness enforcement features. A compiler for a vegan programming language could be designed to include an artificially intelligent runtime library which attempts to decide if the actions of the program could put people or animals at risk to be harmed, and if so, modify the control flow of the program to prevent possible harm from occurring. This is relevant, because computers, and computer software, are being used as components in machines for the food industry (e.g. meat processing plants) as well as militaries (e.g. missile guidance systems.)<p>Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t eat animals.",1386916336
6899371,comment,6896779,6897806,16,0,limpon,,,"I&#x27;ll try to give you a description of what transcription factors do and what the importance of Stamatoyannopoulos finding is. I hope it doesn&#x27;t sound too weird.<p>Just noticed, how long my &quot;brief&quot; description is, so here is a\nTL;DR: \nComparing cells to computer programs: A program figures out by itself which functions to call based on the byte sequence of the function in memory and changes these preferences based on the environment its running in.<p>As you know, the DNA in our cells encodes the blueprint for all proteins that exist in the human body. I&#x27;m trying to compare this to string encoding, but might be completely wrong, because string encoding is more difficult to me than DNA encoding ;)\nThe DNA is our hard drive. This hard drive holds the information for all proteins. \nA protein will be a string. Our alphabet is made out of 21 characters, they are called amino acids. \nEach character (amino acid) is encoded as a 3bit sequence on the DNA, the so called codon. Opposite to the binary system, we have a base4 system, meaning each bit can have 4 different states (A,T,C,G), the nucleic acids.\nSo, given a byte sequence from the hard drive (gene on the DNA), we always look at codons (three bits) and can then translate those codons into amino acids. \nATG translates to Methionine, GGA translates to Glycine etc....\nHaving 4^3 (64) different codons but only 21 amino acids, some amino acids can be represented by several different codons. On top of that, some codons have a special meaning, such as &quot;\\n&quot;. Those special codons are called &quot;stop codon&quot;, because it marks the end of a protein and the program stops decoding from this point on. In addition, there is also a &quot;start codon&quot; that marks the begin of a string.<p>When a cell wants to make a certain protein, it copies the byte-sequence from the DNA and translates it into the actual amino acid sequence and as such forms proteins (prints a string in our example).<p>The problem we&#x27;re now facing is that every cell in your body (with a few exceptions, of course) has the exact same DNA sequence. But still, nature is able to somehow make different celltypes, such as a skin cell, blood cell, neuron, you get the point.\nThe way how cells &quot;know&quot; which proteins to make is that the hard drive doesn&#x27;t only hold encoded strings but also some byte sequences in between that don&#x27;t encode any strings. These sequences are called regulatory sequences. These sequences attract so called transcription factors.\nTranscription factors are proteins that you could understand as a pointer. They will point to some genes, but not to others and thus instruct the cell which byte sequences should be translated into strings.<p>These regulatory sequences can not only attract transcription factors, but also suppressive factors. Those are proteins that prevent transcription factors from binding and thus ensure that certain proteins are not made.<p>There are hundreds of different transcription factors and repressors encoded on the DNA, but only a handful exist as protein in each given cell and they define the difference between celltypes. They come and go as the cell&#x27;s environment changes as well.<p>So, going back to our string analogy, say you have saved thousands of strings on your harddrive but only want to show a subset of those to the user (eg language selection). You start your program by passing some information about which strings to choose. The same happens here as well, only that the information which strings to chose is somehow intrinsic but still different between celltypes. And on top of that you not only have distinct languages, but the languages overlap and language A uses string 1,2,3; language B uses string 2,5,6; and language C uses string 1,2,6 etc. \nBecause of this complexity it is very difficult to understand how the cell &quot;knows&quot; which proteins are right.<p>Stamatoyannopoulos now for the first time proved that even though two different codons encode the same amino acids they might attract different transcription factors.<p>To get an understanding of the importance of this finding, imagine having a character encoding, such as DNA, where two different byte sequences encode the exact same string. Now imagine having a program that automatically chooses which strings to display based on which byte sequences encode certain characters.<p>And now, image that the DNA doesn&#x27;t only encode strings, but also functions and closures, pointers, variables etc. So each time a part of the DNA is translated, the state of the program changes. Nature is vey complex and we&#x27;re just at the beginning of understanding the code.<p>We have methods where we can out-comment some part of the DNA and see how the program changes (mutations). In addition, we recently learned how to see which part of the DNA is being used in certain cells. And in this paper, they refined this method by actually looking at all pointers in a cell and figuring out which part of the DNA they pointed at. And they did this for 81 different cell types to find networks that act together in certain settings.",1386916335

No idea if there&#x27;s any other interactions, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea to rely on this stuff much for nutrition.<p>Aside from that, he vetted the formula by an uncontrolled, unblinded study with a sample size of n=1 (i.e. trying it himself for a few months), and he says on his blog that he &quot;started having joint pain and found [he] fit the symptoms of a sulfur deficiency. This makes perfect sense as [he] consume[s] almost none, and sulfur is a component of every living cell. Sulfur is hard to miss in a typical diet so the FDA would have little reason to recommend it. A typical male physique has 140g of sulfur, making it the sixth most abundant element in the human body. Ten grams of sulfur from Methylsulfonylmethane cured me right away, and I now consume 2g/day.&quot; [3]<p>In that same post, he says that &quot;After three months I should be finding deficiencies, and I did&quot;, and makes major revisions to his formula, apparently assuming that he&#x27;s figured it all out this time. He puts a significant amount of fiber in the formula for the first time, going from 1.2 grams to 40 grams, in line with the 38 grams recommended for men under 50 [4], which was probably a good idea considering how much low fiber intake increases the risk of heart attack [5].<p>A month later, he responds to criticism by saying that &quot;there have been no deficiency symptoms, and if this becomes a problem the amounts can be changed to compensate&quot; [6]. His dismissal of concern ignores the fact that many known nutrient deficiencies can take much longer to manifest, and have severe irreversible harm (like B12 deficiency leading to nerve damage, or developing heart disease after years of insufficient fiber intake, or calcium deficiencies and osteoporosis). He also says that &quot;The initial sample size was small and the timeframe short, but the results are easily reproducible, as shown by the community site discourse.soylent.me&quot;, as if having a greater amount of data overcomes the fact that the sample was extremely biased, still short-running, and with nothing even resembling a credible study design or consistent data collection.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s not a bad thing that Soylent&#x27;s probably not going to take off?<p>[0] <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1600930\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1600930</a><p>[1] <a href=\"http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FBJN%2FBJN85_S2%2FS000711450100109Xa.pdf&code=4b47255651139890417e3dfa463249ff\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FBJN%2FBJN...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2058577\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2058577</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://robrhinehart.com/?p=570\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://robrhinehart.com/?p=570</a><p>[4] <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fiber/NU00033\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fiber/NU00033</a><p>[5] <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8941095\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8941095</a><p>[6] <a href=\"http://robrhinehart.com/?p=507\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://robrhinehart.com/?p=507</a>",1386915777

Markets automatically value knowledge and discoveries at nothing because you typically have to possess knowledge (sometimes for 100 years) before you can estimate its value. If the development of a new industry goes through stages &quot;A B C D ... X Y Z,&quot; where A-M are academic discoveries, the market awards 100% of the profit to N-Z and maybe a percent or two to M if they got lucky with patents, even though A-M required significant capital expenditure to carry out.<p>Everything we care about has been touched by uncompensated academics in some way (uncompensated = rewarded with <1% of the produced value for the purposes of argument). Much of the Nitrogen in your body comes from the Haber process. The air you breathe has benefited from emission reduction chemistry figured out by academics. The basis for the chemistry that produced the plastics around you was all figured out by academics (albeit tested, refined, and implemented by better paid engineers). Academic physicists made semiconductor models that formed the basis of simulations that made the industry practical. If you&#x27;re not on Windows, academics wrote a healthy chunk of the OS on your computer. Physicists figured out the details of nuclear energy (in the US, 20% of the energy you are using right now) and built models that are used to a significant degree in the engineering of all of the others. Scientists are going to be responsible for pulling our collective asses out of the fire wrt global warming. The more I write the more I realize (and hopefully you realize) just how silly this train of thought is. As for mathematics, where would engineers be without linear algebra or calculus? How much less efficient would industry be without linear programming (programming = schedule making in this context)? It&#x27;s impossible to even formulate these thoughts correctly because everything is interrelated.<p>I challenge <i>you</i> (great?-grandparent libertarian) to find an industry that does not inextricably depend upon some kind of model or fact produced by uncompensated academics (as defined above -- use any threshold for value capture you deem appropriate).<p>Whatever the market rewards people for, it is not value creation. It is value creation multiplied by a long list of factors which often go to 0 for arbitrary reasons (your customers are too poor, your product is not excludable, etc.)<p>---------<p>Fortunately, people are not rational actors wrt accumulating money.

Will IE implement a Dart VM in their browser?  Perhaps not, but perhaps so.  Maybe Firefox will.  Opera will probably get a VM for free.  Developers will be able to choose to target different platforms for different reasons.  Dart as an complement, or an alternative to JS.  If you choose, write your code in Dart, and cross-compile to JS for browsers that don&#x27;t support the native Dart.<p>To all those who have said (here and elsewhere) they would never adopt Dart because they fear it will be swept up in one of Google&#x27;s famous spring cleaning barrages, moving Dart from a Google-only project to a formal standard with a test suite and backing outside of Mountain View should eliminate that complaint.  The community (that&#x27;s all of us) will soon own Dart.",1386914885

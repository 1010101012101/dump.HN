3806648,comment,3806413,3806413,2,0,keithpeter,,,"It might be of interest to mention a few things here<p>1) Gnome Shell when installed along side Unity will have the Unity style 'rollover' scrollbars. These can be disabled, but that setting is desktop wide, so you lose the rollover scrollbars in your Unity session<p>2) Gnome Classic is a reasonable facsimile of Gnome 2 UI for end users who do not require extensive panel customisation or lots of applets. I'm thinking of the army of people who will upgrade from Ubuntu 10.04.4 to 12.04.x over the next year or so. I've tested the 'software update' upgrade process from 10.04 to 12.04 and it works really well.  When 12.04 is released, the software update application in all 10.04 installations will provide a 'distribution upgrade' button. I imagine a lot of people will get a bit of a shock when they upgrade, go and have coffee and come back to Unity!<p>3) Unity2d is rather nice in my opinion and avoids the compiz issues that people sometimes see depending on their hardware. Unity2d now has HUD which is interesting.<p>4) If you install 12.04 command line from the netinstall iso, you can just apt-get gnome-core and get a relatively stock gnome-shell/gnome-classic desktop. You need to install some sound libraries and then choose your applications.",1333709639

As business grows, my goal is 1) to amplify and multiply my skills, which made this business possible. That way I can delegate work, be in many places at once and do things faster and better. 2) to patch and overcome my flaws, which I'm self-conscious enough to know, and fear that they could hurt business.<p>So when I look through resumes and interview people, I look for signals that tell me this person can (or has the potential to) either emulate my most demanded virtues, or provide wished-for aptitudes onboard. So, if I read a resume with spelling mistakes, I think ""I would never allow me to be this sloppy"" -- I think it sends a message of carelessness that may put in question the quality of the work being done -- and I throw the resume away. On the other hand, when I meet a person that shows me a code sample with a well-organized and thoroughly commented api class hierarchy, I think ""I wish I was like that!"" -- and that's a keeper.<p>Hence I don't agree with the article when it says to ""ignore little theories"". Since I believe there's no universally-accepted, truly objective way to effectively spot strangers that will make your enterprise succeed, I choose to clone myself: me who is undeniably the right person for the job, otherwise this company would never launched in the first place.

It's silly of companies to think that just because Apple did it that means they can do it, too. Apple has much more going for them than just a proprietary OS.<p>Supporting WP7 was also a bad strategic move on the part of companies like HTC and Samsung, because they gained almost nothing from it, but they kept the flame alive for a year until Nokia was ready to take it all away from them. So instead of allowing their biggest phone manufacturer competitor in the market to fade away by not supporting WP7, they supported it, and with that they helped Nokia come back a bit (at least in terms of brand image), which also has Microsoft's full support (and they don't).<p>The Amazon hype went up because a lot of Android users supported it, the tech media saw the attention it was getting and kept writing about it, too. But as soon as there are real Android tablets on the market for the same price, Amazon has nothing on Google's Android, considering most of their apps and services are already on Android. A Kindle Fire tablet would have no advantage over an Android one, once they are the same price.",1333707115

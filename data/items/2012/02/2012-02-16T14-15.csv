The robust Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) tool enables users to gain significantly faster insight when conducting root cause analysis.
The MySQL monitoring feature includes 246 monitoring variables and more than 21 different metrics to provide one of the easiest to use, yet comprehensive database monitoring tools available. It was first introduced into the free Monitor.Us platform back in June last year and has seen the code battle hardened by many hundred free users over the last 8 months.
Hovhannes Avoyan, founder and General Manager at Monitis commented This feature makes it easy for systems administrators and web developers to measure and monitor the performance of their php environments such as Joomla and WordPress, from multiple locations around the world. It gives them a true picture of application performance from where ever in the world the user is. Because the Monitis MySQL monitor is part of the Monitis platform it provides an unprecedented holistic view of software, database and underlying hardware, giving pressured techs the ability to quickly and easily diagnose the root cause of slow application performance.
The service uses a small Linux agent that can monitor inside an organizations firewall and distributed systems. The Monitis agent connects to a local or remote database and collects a variety of health and performance metrics that are graphically displayed in real-time on a web-based dashboard. Users can also set up notifications (should their database go down or pass a certain level of access volume) based on client-defined thresholds and rules.
Some metrics tracked and reported on by Monitis  which can be set up in minutes  include:
	Database size
	Resource utilization
	Analysis of responsiveness/latency
	Analysis of throughput
	Database usage
	Scalability
Monitis SaaS delivery and pay as you go pricing mean its easy to get going and has low set up and running costs. It puts the power of MySQL monitoring in the reach of techs who otherwise wouldnt have had the time to set up or budget to afford such a comprehensive solution. adds Avoyan
Monitis MySQL Monitoring provides much greater check-in frequency, as low as every 5 minutes, and the ability to check the performance of the database from multiple locations around the world.

3598787,comment,3598528,3598696,16,0,st3fan,,,"Read what Gruber writes about that Gatekeep feature:<p>My favorite Mountain Lion feature, though, is one that hardly even has a visible interface. Apple is calling it Gatekeeper. Its a system whereby developers can sign up for free-of-charge Apple developer IDs which they can then use to cryptographically sign their applications. If an app is found to be malware, Apple can revoke that developers certificate, rendering the app (along with any others from the same developer) inert on any Mac where its been installed. In effect, it offers all the security benefits of the App Store, except for the process of approving apps by Apple. Users have three choices which type of apps can run on Mountain Lion:<p><pre><code>  * Only those from the App Store
  * Only those from the App Store or which are signed by a developer ID
  * Any app, whether signed or unsigned
</code></pre>
The default for this setting is, I say, exactly right: the one in the middle, disallowing only unsigned apps. This default setting benefits users by increasing practical security, and also benefits developers, preserving the freedom to ship whatever software they want for the Mac, with no approval process.",1329402902

It's kind of a sad thing to say, because Growl was for many years a fine notifications platform. However I always wondered why there was no standard provided by Apple. It didn't matter much until Growl's development took a radical new direction. No, I'm not referring to charging for the product, the app would have been worth the $2. But I am disgruntled about its bugginess and backwards-incompatibility. Presently Growl is crippled on my system. It works for apps that have updated to the new protocol. For others it doesn't. And it still suffers from bugs. So my hope is that Notification Center will prove to be a unifying standard for Mac apps.",1329402146

The feature list looks super promising as a nextstep (sorry, had to) in unifying mobile with desktop. It's nice to see that the desktop OS is not being abandoned but instead updated to better reflect a consumers preference for mobile (with good reason). Microsoft has also got it right by tying their Metro interface in Windows 8 to the Windows Phone OS. The attempt, however, falls short in that it is not really unifying the two platforms but instead providing a common interface and feel. In order to truly unite desktop with mobile, I believe you need to go beyond providing a common interface and really integrate the components so they exist to the user simultaneously instead of in parellel.

3598620,comment,3597994,3598322,1,0,jon4than,,,"Thanks for your feedback.<p>1. Because the XML generated by IB is completely incomprehensible for the average (or even experienced) developer. The XML from IB was never intended to be modified by the end-user. If you're talking about why you'd want to use XML at all over IB, well there are several reasons: Firstly, many advanced developers have ended up ditching IB for anything more than the most trivial interfaces, because you can only do so much with point-and-click, sooner or later it is just easier to do everything in code. Secondly, IB can become confusing when working with lots of different views which have exotic properties; you inevitably waste time clicking through submenus to find the property you're looking for -- IB simply doesn't let you have a bird's-eye view of your project and hides options away. The XML approach on the other hand gives you a single file containing your entire view, all in one place -- a true embodiment of MVC.<p>2. Localisation can be done with the existing APIs that are already in place. Alternatively, one could (or I could) extend Pegasus to deal with localisation in a wide range of other interesting ways. For example, you could specify additional attributes to deal with each region, or specify a system whereby each tag is flagged with a token that relates to a string localisation table. Pegasus is simply a bridge between the XML and native UIKit controls, nothing more. You can still access all of the traditional UIKit classes and properties at runtime.<p>3. I wouldn't say that Pegasus reinvents the wheel, I'd say it just offers a different way of driving the wheel. For example, on Android users are able to create their views in XML, but this functionality has not (until now) been available to iOS developers. I'm simply providing a different approach to creating a view, and while I'm at it, looking at providing a <i>better</i> way of creating views, by completely separating code from the views, implementing useful features like hex-to-UIColor and JavaScript-CSS-Selector-style searching for views based on tags and IDs. Thanks to recommendations I've received today I'm also looking at creating layout attributes/tags whereby views can be laid out automatically according so predefined templates, something that just isn't possible currently. But it's important to remember Pegasus in its current state is just an initial proof-of-concept. I'm in the process of gathering feedback and ideas and looking to build upon it. This is definitely not the finished product.<p>4. I think that this is a product that transcendes the new/experienced developer divide. Instead, let's look at the complexity of the product. I think that what Pegasus provides right now is a very fast way to prototype a UI. For beginners, this means they can write a UI without needing to know the nuances of UIKit or the details of IB (which can be daunting at first). With Pegasus, what you write is what you get, and I've tried to remove excess ""fluff"" and boilerplate code wherever possible (e.g. I implemented ""virtual properties""). For experienced developers, I think that -- in time (not yet!) -- Pegasus can provide a way to be able to strictly enforce an MVC workflow, and to refactor and design views in a fraction of the time it could otherwise take, without having the hassles of IB or the micro-management needed in Objective-C: I just don't see why developers should have to worry about creating object references, structs and enums when all they are doing is creating a view. This should all be a totally separate workflow.<p>And what's more, I think that Pegasus provides a way for non-developers to be able to design UIs. Even using IB requires some knowledge of Cocoa Touch/ObjC, but with Pegasus the ultimate goal is to create a powerful platform on which UIs can be designed and prototyped with only a basic knowledge of XML.",1329401244

I'm still pessimistic about the amount of syntax being introduced here.<p>In particular, I still really dislike the special import ""local renaming"" syntax since it seems so unnecessary compared to just having an import keyword that returns an object and letting the programmer extract and manipulate the relevant entries. You would still get the static analysis benefits of having static imports without all the awkward complexity of the current proposal. Wouldn't it just be the same thing to Object.freeze() the export object but without any syntax magic necessary?<p>Plus, overloading `module` to do loading AND defining with the `module Bar at ""uri""` form seems really wrong.

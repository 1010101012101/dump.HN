9037475,comment,9034673,9035557,0,0,allemagne,,,"This is textbook confirmation bias. You&#x27;re ignoring the writings of every Chinese philosopher valuing hard work, the tendency for Chinese schools to value rote memorization--a very work-intensive activity--over creativity, the fact that American railroads were basically built by the Chinese, and the fact that you&#x27;re likely reading this on a device made by hard-working Chinese hands. Your willingness to see East Asian culture as inherently underhanded because of an internet game is somewhat telling.<p>>western cultures have Aesop fables (e.g. Tortoise and the Hare) which tend to celebrate hard work and punish laziness. Eastern cultures have fables that tend to celebrate being clever or manipulative (e.g. The lion and The Rabbit).<p>Aesop fables valuing cleverness: The Clever Sheep, The Crow and the Pitcher, The Ass in the Lion&#x27;s Skin, the Fox and the Sick Lion, the Fox and the Mask... there are others. Ancient Greek heroes are constantly clever and manipulative.<p>Well-known Chinese fables celebrating hard work and punishing laziness:<p>磨杵成针 (Grinding an Iron Pestle into a Needle)\nLi Bai was fond of playing when he was young, so he was always absent-minded in classes. Today he would catch little birds on the hill, and tomorrow he would pick dates on that hill. One day, he saw an old lady sitting at the riverside when he was crossing the brook. The old lady was grinding an iron pestle without fear of tiredness. On seeing this, Li Bai laughed at her and said: &quot;People who do this job are fools.&quot; The old lady answered kindly: &quot;I am determined to grind the iron pestle into a needle even if the iron pestle is so thick and hard. &quot;Li Bai took the iron pestle and felt tired after grinding it for a minute. Then he complained: &quot;Oh, how long can I get it done? I quit.&quot; The old lady shook her head and sighed: &quot;The pestle can be grinded into a needle, as long as you keep working hard.&quot; The old lady’s words moved him, and Li Bai remembered them by heart. From then on, he spared no pains to study, and eventually became a great poet.<p>精卫填海 (Jingwei filling the sea)\nOriginally the daughter of the emperor Yandi, Jingwei perished at a young age in the East Sea. After her death she chose to assume the shape of a bird in order to exact revenge upon the sea by bringing stones and small twigs from the mountains nearby over the sea in an effort to fill it up. Jingwei has a short dialogue with the sea where the sea scoffs her, claiming that she wouldn&#x27;t be able to fill it up even in a million years, whereupon she claims that she will then proceed to take ten million years, even one hundred million years, whatever it takes to fill up the sea so that others would not have to perish as she did.<p>守株待兔 (waiting by a tree stump for rabbits)\nIn the Spring and Autumn Period, a farmer in the State of Song was one day working in the fields, when he saw a rabbit bump into a tree stump accidentally and break its neck. The farmer took the rabbit home, and cooked himself a delicious meal. That night he thought, &quot;I needn&#x27;t work so hard. All I have to do is wait for a rabbit each day by the stump.&quot; So from then on he gave up farming, and simply sat by the stump waiting for rabbits to come and run into it. The saying satirizes those who wait for strokes of luck instead of working.",1423717199

9037467,comment,9035523,9037155,0,0,platz,,,"> An often better alternative to chaining is composition<p>It&#x27;s not explained, but one of the reasons why is that function composition refactors more easily than chained code.  The first operand (i.e. the value) in the chained code alters the semantics of all the subsequent chained code.  You cannot replace parts of the chain as easy as you can with vanilla function composition; you always have that first value to worry about, and this reduces reusability slightly (compared to composition)",1423717040

Late 19th century critics of aether might have compared it to caloric (a theoretical entity that explained a particular set of thermodynamic observations.) Caloric turned out not to exist.<p>By the same token, we might compare dark matter to neutrinos, which were a theoretical entity invoked to explain a particular set of observations on radioactivity (the shape of the beta spectrum.) Neutrinos turned out to exist.<p>As such, while the comparison to aether is superficially apt, it is not something we can draw any conclusions from, because the comparison to the neutrino is equally apt.<p>Science is the discipline of publicly testing ideas by systematic observation, controlled experiment and Bayesian inference. It is not the discipline of testing ideas by making analogies to other ideas. There is a reason for this: making analogies to other ideas has consistently proven to be almost completely useless for creating knowledge of reality, while the discipline of science has been wildly successful.<p>Nor are the properties of caloric, aether, neutrinos or dark matter &quot;magical&quot;. They are merely the ones required of an entity that is able to explain our observations in each instance. In the case of caloric it turned out to have self-contradictory properties, when the full deductive closure of the theory was teased out. In the case of aether it turned out to have properties that made predictions that were false. In the case of neutrinos the required properties made predictions that were true.<p>In the case of dark matter: we don&#x27;t know yet, and the only way we will ever know is if we continue on with our program of systematic observation, controlled experiment and Bayesian inference. There is no other way to know.",1423716022

Let&#x27;s write that function in Haskell.<p>last :: [a] -> a<p>Without looking at an implementation, let&#x27;s think of how many ways this function could possibly go wrong?  It could return the first element of the list instead of the last one.  It could return the second to last element of the list.  More generally, it could return any one of the elements of the list that was passed in.  But <i>that&#x27;s it</i> (other than the empty list case which for simplicity we can ignore because it&#x27;s a condition we can statically detect).

I could go on and on.<p>The point here is that you simply can&#x27;t say as much about what this function could be doing as we could say about the Haskell version.  This is the case for every mainstream language in wide use today.  Some languages allow you to say a little more than others, but none of them come close to what Haskell gives you.

Though I understood the sentiment, at it didn&#x27;t really strike a chord with me. The people I was working with, even the ones I didn&#x27;t particularly care for, were still usually producing something of value, and that to me seemed like the most important thing.<p>Today I had an experience that made me reconsider.<p>Via a friendly intro, I&#x27;d crossed paths with a local founder, and we decided to get coffee and chat. Everything was fine until the part where I mentioned that I was impressed by his company&#x27;s website and asked him who&#x27;d done it.<p>&quot;Get this,&quot; he told me. &quot;A 15 year old kid did it. For free.&quot;<p>I asked him how he&#x27;d convinced a 15 year-old kid to build him a free website.<p>&quot;All he asked for in exchange for the website was $1,000 in bit coin,&quot; he said. &quot;I told him I&#x27;d pay him, but then I just never did.&quot;<p>When I asked him why, he said they&#x27;d never signed a contract or anything, so why should he? I imagine he picked up on the weird look I was giving him, because he started justifying it, talking about how it was a valuable life lesson for the kid.<p>I walked away feeling pretty disgusted.<p>I know that was just one experience.

The existence of wildly successful second-timers does not answer this fact. This slight anti-correlation predicts the existence of wildly successful second-timers. Just fewer of them than you&#x27;d get if you selected an equal number of random first-timers.<p>Secondly, comparison to an existing major player is never a good move for a startup. One of the more frequent arguments I&#x27;ve had in startup environments has been countering the claim that &quot;Microsoft (or Apple, or whoever) does it this way!&quot; as justification for some particular business practice. It is surprisingly difficult to gently disabuse a sincerely committed individual of the notion that their ten-person zero-revenue startup is meaningfully comparable to pick-your-multi-billion-dollar behemoth with tens of thousands of employees, a universally recognized brand, a world-wide distribution network, and a generation of technical expertise.<p>So there is in fact little more than theory to support the validation.

Ph.D. students are produced 10-to-1 relative to tenure track jobs.  Why would universities eat $50-60,000 in tuition and pay $25–35,000 in stipends per year per graduate student if they know they are over-enrolling?  It&#x27;s not like Ph.D. students bring money into a department, regardless of their level of &quot;desperation&quot; to get a terminal degree.  That&#x27;s a big and unnecessary loss to take every single year.<p>The answer is that grad students, like adjuncts, free the professors from the most onerous aspect of teaching classes: doing all the grading.  In exchange for tuition and stipend, grad students have to serve as TAs once or twice a year (in some departments they can also take positions as Research Assistants or as administrators for undergrad programs).  Some grad students will get the opportunity to sole-teach their own seminars.  Because professors do not want to teach, and want to focus entirely on their personal research program and publications, having an excess of grad students around to grade, guest lecture, and fill out the course offerings every semester is worth the $25-$35,000 annual stipend (about the same that the adjunct professor writing this article makes).<p>You&#x27;re right that universities don&#x27;t have to offer any more than $35,000 + shitty benefits + no job security, because the adjuncts and grad students will still take the opportunity believing that it might turn into an opportunity to move up into the professoriate if they just work hard enough or if their next publication is just a little more brilliant.  Doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it&#x27;s still a cynical and hypocritical exploitation of the &quot;intellectual reserve army of labor&quot; (to paraphrase Marx).  Universities are some of the most leftist institutions in North America, but the professoriate and deanery are perfectly fine with naked exploitation both on the supply side (grad students) and the demand side (adjuncts).<p>If departments need graders, they should hire masters students rather than admit Ph.D. students and then cynically consume 5–10 years of their life.  If departments need teachers to supplement their researchers, they should create a position distinct from tenure-track professor/reader, perhaps &quot;lecturer,&quot; but that is not &quot;part-time&quot;/contract work and is compensated appropriately.",1423713996

If you&#x27;re still learning I could see 30 if it&#x27;s a particularly complex page, although that&#x27;s a lot of time to spend on a single page.<p>I advise against pricing per hour and instead quote a fixed price. There&#x27;s lots of reasons why, just Google &quot;why don&#x27;t price hourly&quot; and you&#x27;ll see.<p>I&#x27;d quote them a value and get a feel for how they react. For instance, you could suggest $1000. They might agree. They might say no, and counter-suggest $600. Or if they don&#x27;t have a counter offer, you can always give them a discount. Again, just quote a price you&#x27;re OK with, even if it takes you 30 hours, and then once you have it, you&#x27;re incented to work efficiently (because you&#x27;re not billing per hour, but per job). Your effective hourly rate on this job might end up at $250/hr, for all you know, if you work efficiently.<p>Also, PSD to HTML is a pretty commoditized job.

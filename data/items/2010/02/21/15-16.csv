1140695,comment,1140486,1140486,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"For the first section of the article, I was rather annoyed. The entire premise of the argument is that healthcare ""reform"" is progress, it is our destiny, and that anything standing in its way is wrong by definition.<p>This is most certainly not the case, and reflects that as much as we have problems with our government, the foundations are still working. The compromises inherent in our bicameral legislature and the electoral college are there to protect from the problems that an unchecked majority might lead to. Our system is designed so that even popular ideas backed by a ""mandate"" (an invention of the media; who actually voted for the supposed underlying initiative?) can -- and should be -- blocked if it's so thoroughly repugnant to others.<p>At the risk of skirting up against Godwin's law, the idea that this ""progress"" is destined, part of the inexorable evolution to a higher social order, sounds decidedly Marxian. Frankly, I find such an attitude every bit as alarming as these ""reforms"" to which it refers.<p>That said, the article really does even out and put this all in perspective. If you can make it through the whole article, I think that the picture you wind up with is a pretty fair picture.<p>[Edit: fix bad phrasing in next-to-last para]",1266767815
1140694,comment,1140486,1140645,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Let me say here, though, that the above regards the federal government. The United States of America is a group of independent states on the American continent, just as the European Union is a group of independent states on the European continent.<p>As such, these things are imposed upon the federal government in part because the majority of laws are intended to be enacted by local governments, like states and cities. Each state in the United States has its own constitution and is free to make its own legislative procedures insofar as such procedures do not contradict the Bill of Rights contained in the federal Constitution.<p>For instance, if Kansas wanted to do away with free speech, they would have to withdraw from the union to do so (theoretically), as such a prohibition is contrary to the constitution of the union of independent American states.<p>Or by contrast, if the federal government wanted to impose a law which said all people must wear a seat belt while riding in a car, this would be violate of the federal Constitution and the independent states are free to reject such a law (theoretically). The federal Constitution is clear that any powers not explicitly delegated to the federal government are within the purview of the state.<p>Now, that's the idea. In reality, states make laws and operate under procedures that circumvent fundamental rights frequently, and the federal government enforces its will by withholding funding or imposing other forms of ostracization upon any state that doesn't comply (see age 21 drinking age). Things are even worse now, and constitutions are rarely upheld -- the congresses and legislatures at both federal and state levels just pass whatever they like with complete disregard for its legality, and the public lets them do it -- as long as the public can get their American Idol and Zoloft there are no problems there.<p>The whole thing is just really sad.",1266767801

However, it is helpful for developers to be able to point to large, successful sites that are written in Python, Ruby, Scala, Clojure, etc. because management is not going to take a chance on something that's ""unproven"".  It usually requires overwhelming evidence to convince someone not to keep using the status quo.  Java/JSP, for example.

As Rupert Murdoch is wont to say, the online publishing marketplace has an infinite supply of inventory, which drives down prices for display advertising.<p>The DVD idea might work for some small entrepreneurs who are not in the Internet startup space, but since most of the Interviews are focused on tech and the audience likely wants to see the videos online, there is a conflict there. Maybe Andrew should start expanding into other areas of entrepreneurship that appeal more to the non-Internet crowd?<p>One other note about transcripts: They are a pain to produce, as most of them have to be done manually. Prices are coming down thanks to online services and Mechanical Turk. But once voice-to-text tech improves to the degree where it's possible to instantly convert any podcast or video interview to text (and thence to e-book or whatever) that will really open the gates to e-book and custom publishing models, IMHO.

1140635,comment,1140486,1140575,0,0,barrkel,,,"The US arguably has a more unbalanced system than parliamentary democracies. The US system places the head of state and the head of the executive in the same person, the president. This can lead to a kind of reverence around the president, where directly and harshly criticising them leads to accusations of unpatriotic behaviour.<p>European governments, meanwhile, are not easily placed into a single bucket. For example, a government can fall over a vote of no confidence, which is much less involved than impeachment. Governments made up of coalitions - which are more likely with e.g. single transferable vote election systems - are often forced to be centrist to some degree, because they would fail a vote of no confidence should they anger one of the coalition parties too much.",1266764890

Go to a Walgreens clinic next time you have a sore throat. Even if you have strep, you'll get taken care of without ever setting foot in a doctor's office.<p>It's easy to see that taking the load off overqualified, overly expensive doctors is a good idea, which is why this idea is actually being implemented.<p>What I'm more interested in is whether we think it's a good idea to have those providers working in call centers. Because, from what I can tell, the economics of call centers are almost exactly opposed to customer care.",1266764778

I suppose the short response is that I dislike dishonest government.  if a government isn't really a democracy but rather something else then the power should not be allowed to go cloaked.  the illusion of control by the common citizen causes wasteful misdirection of resources.",1266764680

So I don't see why an interviewee should be offended that Andrew is profiting.<p>Most interviewers profit by charging advertisers. The advertisers then become the customers and the viewers are just ""users."" By choosing to charge his listeners directly Andrew is making his viewers his customers.<p>A business naturally tries to please its customers. To the extent that advertisers' and viewers' tastes differ, we can expect Andrew's business to change for the better: it will be more pleasing to viewers.",1266764656

1140628,comment,1140537,1140617,0,0,patio11,,,"We do it in the status quo in a few very limited fashions: for example, many hospitals have a line for new parents to call in where they will get a nurse who will listen to them, calm them down, and tell them that $SYMPTOM is within normal operating parameters for their new infant and that they should not panic unless $CONDITION happens.  My sister in law is a maternity nurse, and she works on one of these.  She's a wonderful woman who would be equally wonderful talking you through it if you were in Calcutta when calling her.  I assume there is some wonderful woman in Calcutta who can do the same.  That would free my very expensive sister in law to do stuff which more uniquely requires her considerable expertise.<p>90% of medical care is low-skilled well-understood grunt work.  Much of it is readily identifiable as such.  There are huge structural disincentives from building our medical care processes to take advantage of this.",1266764581

Tap to click.<p>For elements such as the video player example, the cursor (just as on PC) can fade after time, and a tap or shake would re-show it.<p>For most of the scenarios he mentions, using accelerometer to drive a hovered cursor would be a particularly intuitive solution.",1266764465

Then again, maybe he told them the content will be free but there is a possibility that one day it will not be free anymore. Either way, the better approach would have been to leave existing interviews freely available and start applying the pricing structure from the present onward.<p>On another note, I'm glad to see Andrew turning Mixergy into a real business that can be self-sustaining. As entrepreneurs, we should all be able to agree with that.",1266764457

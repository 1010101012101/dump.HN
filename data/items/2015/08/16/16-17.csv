The rich, and the poor alike understand that one of the main reasons for a government is to protect those who can&#x27;t protect themselves (from circumstance, even).<p>The money is there. The food is there. The shelter is there. It&#x27;s <i>all there</i>, yet you see individuals suffering left, right and center and even dying. Meanwhile, we can&#x27;t even get the politicians to provide basic housing, food, healthcare and jobs for society&#x27;s bottom rung.<p>Perhaps, the reason you question the use of violence as a solution to this problem is because you feel that there is no other recourse. We&#x27;ve been doing the &quot;democracy&quot; thing for a while, yet we can&#x27;t get the basics right. Hell, we can&#x27;t even up and call for a country-wide referendum on basic hotly-debated topics. It&#x27;s all a circus, and the poor are barely getting enough bread to get by.",1439744398

I want Amazon to take better care of employees precisely because I have money invested in them; because I believe in a knowledge economy, the greatest asset a company has is its people, and in the long-term this will matter. Amazon can be a lot more valuable, if employees can build long-term careers there and are better cared for.<p>I am rational. I want my money to work hard for my family. If I believe, I can provide a secure future for my family by investing in AMZN then I will do that. Through all the mutual/index funds, I am probably invested in a lot of companies whose practices I disagree with. Examples: Avoiding taxes (double irish with a dutch sandwich), super low minimum wages and expecting public to pay for their care (walmart and food stamps use of their employees), abysmal working conditions (foxconn deaths/suicides), shipping manufacturing jobs to China/Malaysia/Philippines and exploiting low-wage workers there, advertising and selling unhealthy/processed and getting kids hooked to high-{sugar,salt,bad fat} diet. We have practically proved that the best engine to create wealth is capitalism. The dichotomy you have provided is a false one. I love all the good properties of capitalism but I am also aware of its acute shortcomings, if there is no government or regulation. This doesn&#x27;t mean that I will stop being a rational economic actor.<p>Things I mentioned are what I heard from current/ex Amazon employees. What I wrote about benefits are facts (else people would have refuted them right away). Only exaggeration was about Execs laughing their asses off; I was just  making a point.",1439744311

I&#x27;m from Finland, so I won&#x27;t give any product recommendations. One thing I noticed it is very hard to find information about treadmills that you don&#x27;t plan to use just for running, and might need to lose the handrails.<p>Long answer would depend on questions like how much space you have, how much do you weight, budget, planning to run also, do you have a desk already and how adjustable it is, and so on.<p>I think I only found one site on the net that talked about making your own treadmill desk. As the luck would have, he used the same cheap model I managed to track down (about $200). If you go cheap, it probably fits better and you can get rid of the handrails if need be. If it&#x27;s more expensive, it probably is so sturdy that your standing desk needs larger adjustments to fit around and on top of it.<p>For me the Ergotron setup I have needs heavier setup to wall, but other than that, things work fine.

There are a number of aspects of the compositional parameters here that I think make it much easier to generate this kind of music.<p>Firstly, it&#x27;s modal harmony, not diatonic. In this case, dorian mode in A. If you&#x27;ve every improvised in say, a whole tone scale, you notice that you can play almost anything and it sounds good. Modal music works in a similar way. A lot of the things you find in diatonic harmony: the tension between tonic and dominant, chord progressions in general, key changes, chromatic inflections, etc....are all absent in this kind of music. Which isn&#x27;t to say anything bad about modal music, just that it&#x27;s much simpler. Because of the added complexity of diatonic harmony, there are many many more ways the music could &quot;go wrong&quot; so to speak. Most people are so grounded in diatonic harmony that they would easily perceive even small mistakes (or statistically speaking, deviations from the norm) without necessarily being able to explain what rule, exactly, is being broken.<p>It&#x27;s also monophonic music; there&#x27;s just the one voice and no accompaniment (other than a completely static rhythmic accompaniment that was added to the performance).<p>Finally, even within this much simpler framework, I&#x27;d argue this tune gets it wrong in a big way: it doesn&#x27;t know how to come to an end. It just sort of stops, in medias res. In a lot of folk music, you&#x27;ll find that the way a tune is ended still tends to hearken back to diatonic harmony: some sort of motion from dominant (e), maybe even with a raised 7th scale degree to tonic (a) that&#x27;s outlined by the melody. That doesn&#x27;t happen here, which is why the tune sounds like it just got cut off.<p>I find these NN experiments in music generation quite interesting conceptually, but so far the results--as music--have been pretty disappointing. I suspect that you could actually build a model that would allow for algorithmic generation of folk tunes that would produce music that would probably be more satisfying. The number of rules that govern a lot of kinds of folk music are small enough that you could encode many or at least most of them in your model. [1] However, at the end of the day you&#x27;d still just have a model that would only generate a fairly limited spectrum of folk music--say Irish gigues, reels, hornpipes, etc--whereas the dream with NNs, markov models and other statistical methods is that you could plug in any corpus of songs without understanding a thing about their harmony, form, structure, melodic patterns, etc. and get back music that sounds the same.<p>[1] and this is really massively simplifying on my part w/r/t the varied amount of folk music out there, some of it quite complex",1439743957

For example, maybe your mindset is &quot;save&quot; because you earn a good salary and you know that if you save, in a few years you&#x27;ll be well-off and will be able to afford exponentially more, whereas the rest of your family objectively has no way out of poverty, so they don&#x27;t even try.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/21/linda-tirado-poverty-hand-to-mouth-extract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/21/linda-tirado-...</a>",1439743793

Education is far more important to what we consider &quot;intelligence&quot; in this context. Basic math, financial literacy, or even reading comprehension is far more a result of your education than it is of your genetic material.<p>It&#x27;s easy, as a product of good education and a safe environment, to look at people in poverty and say &quot;I guess they&#x27;re not as smart as me.&quot; This hides a far more uncomfortable truth, which is that everyone who doesn&#x27;t grow up in poverty has access to better education, better opportunities, and a better environment than those in poverty. Try as you might to claim that people in poverty are just &quot;stupider&quot;, it&#x27;s simply impossible to make this comparison given that people on opposite ends of the financial spectrum grow up in totally different environments.

The main issue Unity (and other big asm.js codebases) are seeing is OOMs and crashes in Chrome. The v8 and JavaScriptCore approach can avoid those, by not compiling everything at once, more efficient in-memory data structures, and so forth. This helps overall JS performance as well. It&#x27;s just engineering work that needs to be prioritized and done.<p>(AOT, as in Firefox and Edge, does have an advantage in startup speed that I think v8 and JavaScriptCore will have a hard time approaching, but that is not a blocking issue the way that crashes and OOMs are.)",1439742859

The miners for example might be hoping that if the 1-meg limit remains in place, transaction fees will become a significant fraction of mining rewards, which would increase the total income of mining (income being essentially the built-in rewards, which are not affected by the fork plus the transaction fees). Holders of large positions in Bitcoin on the other hand -- what is their reason for preferring one fork or the other?  Ditto merchants who accept a lot of Bitcoin transactions.<p>ADDED. As far as I can tell, the designers Bitcoin XT sofware have done what they can to minimize the distruptiveness of the fork on the lives of the other stakeholders -- by, e.g., refraining from doing anything to affect anyone but the miners till 2 weeks after a full 75% of miners (or 75% of hashing power -- not sure which) are running the XT software.<p>ADDED. Yes, I realize that any additional income gained by the miners will be paid by Bitcoin senders (e.g., people using Bitcoin to pay for things), so in that sense Bitcoin senders have just as much at stake as the miners do, <i>but</i> transaction fees will always be a very small fraction of the costs (considered collectively) of the senders of Bitcoin, so this is another instance of the very common situation where a large number of people are affected in some very small way by some policy decision whereas a smaller number of people are affected in a more significant and material way, and we know (from experience with democratic governments) that what usually happens in that situation is that the smaller group (whose interests are &quot;concentrated&quot;) has a much larger influence on the decision than the larger group (whose interests are &quot;diffuse&quot;).",1439742472

It becomes about people&#x27;s egos and shoehorning in their sets or showing that they can keep up with the best. Really, it should be about friends socializing and sharing music. Tunes-tunes-tunes-tunes is antisocial and a bit mechanical when it comes down to it.<p>At another workshop, Kevin Creehan (Junior Creehan&#x27;s grandson) noted how it was strange for seisuns to end up in pubs. Originally, they were in people&#x27;s houses. They were intimate gatherings of family and friends, and some of the heights of artistry in Irish trad music clearly stem from this quieter and more intimate context.<p>For the most part Bay Area seisuns seem to include a healthy dose of socializing and human interaction. Haven&#x27;t been down to Mountain View yet. I hear those guys play fast. O&#x27;Flarety&#x27;s in San Jose is pretty raucous, but even so, they manage to get in a good amount of socializing.<p>You techies that show up to The Plough and the Stars sessions -- know that you are in one of the premier sessions in North America, both for the skill of musicians and the health of the community that surrounds it. Don&#x27;t expect to be entertained, like it&#x27;s a show for you. It&#x27;s a gathering for the musicians to share music with other musicians. If you like Irish trad, listen carefully, because the very best music comes out when it&#x27;s musicians sharing with their friends. (Also listen patiently, because there&#x27;s still a certain diversity of musicianship.)<p>Also, when someone is singing a slow air, then it&#x27;s good manners to be quiet and listen! (And very bad manners if you don&#x27;t!)",1439742079

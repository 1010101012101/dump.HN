3807640,comment,3802438,3802438,3,0,jaffathecake,,,"My initial worry is the subjectiveness of ""offence"".<p>As a speaker I like to think I'm putting on a show, I try to make my talks entertaining by throwing in a few jokes. If jokes were discouraged at a conference, I'd neither want to speak or attend. Unfortunately, I don't think it's possible to crack a joke without potentially causing someone offence. Maybe my favourite chicken got run over trying to get to the other side.<p>An example I trot out when talking about ""offence"" happened at uni. We were watching a comedian, he was making jokes about pedophilia and rape much to the delight of the audience and specifically one of my flatmates. I thought the comedian was terrible, not because of his subject matter (I don't believe any subject is out-of-bounds for comedy), I just felt his jokes were lazy. He then made a joke about bulimia, my flatmate slammed his drink down in anger. I asked what was up, he replied ""My girlfriend suffered from bulimia, I've seen what it does, I don't think you should joke about it"". I was astounded by the hypocrisy, and replied ""I agree, people who think they can joke about bulimia make me sick"".<p>My point is, it's impossible to predict what may offend a given audience, and I don't think people should try not to offend anyone. My own humour is pretty childish and has offended people, in one talk I refer to this image <a href=""http://wtfhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/comic-captain-america-wank.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wtfhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/comic-captain-a...</a> and later describe the action of a particular browser as ""wanking us in the face"", making it clear that I'm using ""wank"" in the comic onomatopoeic sense rather than referring to a sexual act. This joke has offended a small number of people, causing one to walk out. I don't know if they didn't get the joke, or simply find the sound of the word offensive, but I have no intention of removing the joke when I give the talk again because the vast majority of the audience enjoyed it. This isn't a male/female thing either, and I worry about the suggestion that anything vaguely sexual is offensive totally and exclusively to women.<p>Anyway, I'm getting off topic. I think my point is we need to quantify what ""offensive"" means before it becomes a solid rule. Or make the rule as subjective as the word itself, eg ""If you find something offensive, let us know and we'll investigate it"".",1333727825

I did college recruiting, intern programs, phone screens and interviews. I mention that for background when I say: you can't reliably make good hiring decisions on the basis of a couple hours of your/the interviewees time. It just doesn't work. I'm personally a fan of hiring within your network (for engineering positions). You can't beat a genuine recommendation from someone who's spent months working shoulder-to-shoulder with the candidate.<p>So please, when you hire people, have some humility.

3807629,comment,3806721,3806721,11,0,geebee,,,"I'm a 40 year old with two kids living in San Francisco, and I actually know a lot of people in my position who work for startups.  It's not as big a career risk as people thing, especially in high tech, where career stability is more valuable than job stability.  The people who work for startups tend to have a lot of connections and very sharp skills - qualities that make it easy for them to find a new job quickly.<p>There are a few downsides.  The startups they tend to work for aren't the ""rundown apartment eating ramen"" kind of deals.  They pay decent salaries, though they do offer more upside in exchange for lack of job stability (though like I said, job stability isn't such a big deal if you have a reserve fund and have very sharp skills).  Even so, working for this sort of startup is more like having a job, more casual than a typical bigco but nowhere near as liberating as the PG-style ycombinator startup.  Quasi ""stable"" startups aren't necessarily any better than a job in bigco, and the more they resemble a bigco in terms of pay and benefits, the more likely they are to behave like a bigco toward employees.  Both types of organizations do display a wide range of workstyles.<p>Also, I don't know how it will be as these folks get older.  I've found ""age discrimination"" per se to be overstated so far in my life, but that doesn't mean age won't make for a poor cultural fit. Plus, I am ""only"" 40... so who knows, I may feel it more later.   When you have two kids at home, certain types of startups (the kind that might use the term ""brogramming"", for instance) generally aren't going to be a good fit for a 40+ year old with kids and a mortgage.  I know a programmer in his 50s with teenage kids - the sort of dude who is super sharp in terms of intelligence and technical prowess, physically trim, and a little edgy.  He works with these sorts of companies, but he says he sometimes looks toward more of a consulting arrangement.<p>Lastly, these folks could be at risk in a true meltdown.  The last time I saw this was when during the dot-com bust, when genuinely talented programmers just couldn't get a gig.  The big companies did shed some people, so I can't say bigco is necessarily safer, but there was little doubt that if you needed a stable income, a large organization was better shelter from the storm.  This sort of true bust is rare, but it does happen.  That said, if I did lose my job, I'd rather have the kind of network and technical skillset more common among a startup type than a bigco type who had gotten too comfortable over the last decade...<p>My lesson learned so far is that everything does carry some risk, and that in some ways a bigco career <i>can</i> carry greater risks than a series of startups... there isn't a single hard and fast rule for this.",1333727692

My reasons being: Only a small sliver of developers visit sites like HN. They are mostly busy working, going home to kids and such.  Getting the news out that you are hiring, to this larger set of candidates is a real problem. Which is where the traditional methods (including job web sites) become crucial. If you use any job borads (like Monster), or a headhunter, it is hard to pipe a problem through them. They are not setup for this.  If you had asked me to solve a problem just to find the email to apply to a job, I would have not done so, just because I do not have time to do it.  If I were a kid out of college, or did not have time constraints, I would have loved to. But where I am today, I would rather send the resume in and talk to the hiring manager.",1333726134
3807490,comment,3806971,3807396,10,0,michaelochurch,,,"Fair point. Actually, you've nailed it. C++, for example, isn't some horrible language without purpose. It has a niche that it fills well (although I'd prefer C) but most C++ jobs aren't in that niche.<p>My experience is that language adjustment is up to a 0.5-point drop (the scale is here: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajectory-of-a-software-engineer-and-where-it-all-goes-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajector...</a> ) in an engineer's ability. This is on a 3.0 scale where most engineers are between 1.0 and 2.0, so that's a huge change. Compensation tends to be linear in proficiency but exponential in value-add. 0.5 points is about $50,000 in market pay but a 2-4x (depending on the type of company) difference in productivity.<p>Sometimes it is worth the drop, such as when one's learning a dramatically new and more effective approach, or solving a fresh class of problem (e.g. real-time software, which is done in C). That isn't the case with enterprise, ""pattern""-afflicted Java. Instead of solving the problem appropriately and <i>well</i> because I know how to do it, I have solve problems inappropriately and <i>badly</i> because I don't know the crappy idioms that people invented because they don't have appropriate tools.<p>On that scale above, I put myself around a 1.7. If I set foot in a typical C++ or Java shop, I'd drop to 1.2 or 1.3. Which means I'd risk falling to the level of a junior programmer and being typecast that way. Which means I wouldn't get the benefit of the doubt if I say, ""This project wouldn't be complete shit if we'd done it in an FP language"" (in some nicer words, of course). Your first 6 months determine whether you have technical credibility or not. If you don't, you can't blame the tools, even if bad tools are (as they often are) the cause of the problem. The unenlightened tend to think of all tools as equally good (all languages are Turing complete). No, not so. A 3x difference in CPU performance may not matter for most problems, but the 3x difference in <i>human</i> performance that hinges on whether one uses the wrong tools certainly does.<p>The drop to 1.2 is something I'd tolerate if moving to something genuinely <i>interesting</i>, knowing it'd only take a year to pop back up to the same or even higher level. An example might be high-performance C++ in weather forecasting, bioinformatics, or artificial intelligence. I'd gladly become a junior again for a year for that kind of stuff. On the other hand, most enterprise Java/C++ bullshit isn't really  worth learning, not for a creature that has 60 years left to live instead of 600,000 (#ShitYouCantSayAtWork).<p>So yes, my language bigotry is more directed at the typical C++ or Java job than at the language itself.",1333726122

In general ""as long as the reward justifies the time and expense"" can be said about any security measure.<p>Salting has another benefit too: it makes it virtually useless to find a mere password <i>collision</i>.<p>Say, for example that I use two sites, Spacelook and Squitter, which both use a popular hash called SPARTACUS for their passwords. My password on both sites is ""abracadabraSpanishFly_92@prosperity;"". An attacker gets into Spacelook's database and does a cross reference with their SPARTACUS rainbow table. I happen to be very unlucky and my nice strong password has a SPARTACUS collision with the very short ""a2e34"". Now the attacker goes to Squitter, puts in my username and ""a2e34"" and logs in with no problem <i>even though that's not my password</i>.<p>Now, suppose that Spacelook and Squitter had each used a different per-site salt (not good enough, but better) when they hashed my password, and this time suppose the attacker builds a custom rainbow table for Spacelook's salt and finds that my salted password collides with salted ""fr-_9x32;"". If they go to Squitter and try to log in with ""fr-_9x32;"", Squitter's use of a different salt will cause it to hash differently than my password, and so only my Spacelook account will have been compromised.",1333725283

The reality of the situation is far more complex.<p>Some of the primary sponsors of SOPA were big ISPs, like Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, etc. These companies -- <i>especially</i> Comcast, which owns NBC-Universal -- have vested interests in maintaining and growing their control over the internet.<p>The movie industry represents a significant, but non-majority piece of the puzzle here. I'm not going so far as to call it a red herring, but I <i>would</i> say that a laserlike focus on the MPAA, and the MPAA alone, is dangerously incomplete.<p>Case in point: you rally to the side of Comcast, not realizing that it's a SOPA/PIPA supporter. Similarly, I've read quite a few blog posts calling on movie buyers to switch their time and dollars to the video game industry (whose lobby, the ESA, is also a SOPA/PIPA supporter, and is standing united with the RIAA and MPAA).<p>It's time to draw a more holistic and accurate picture of the battle lines here. There's blood on plenty more hands than we're giving credit for. And continued ignorance of the bigger picture would have us withdrawing support from one SOPA-supporting industry, simply in favor of another.",1333724677

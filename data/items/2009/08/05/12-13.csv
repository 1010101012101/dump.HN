743228,comment,743080,743136,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I know where you're coming from, but I wonder if this observation is just a classic language rant waiting to be born. In other words: I wonder if the problem is <i>not</i> that all higher-level APIs necessarily suck, but that the ones you <i>have</i> suck, and your language platform is too impoverished to profitably work around that.<p>API design is <i>hard</i>. It's like composing poetry, or trying to design the game of chess. (""I know, the queen should be able to jump like a knight if she's on a white square!"") It is bound to take thousands of little trials and errors in order to get things right. And my suspicion is that certain languages and platforms make it especially difficult to tinker with existing APIs, or wrap them while minimizing the leaks, or replace one part of them and leave the others alone, or build them in a way that makes it easy to compose complex higher-order objects and behaviors out of little pieces. When working with those systems, the most efficient way to solve any given problem is to just slog through, trying to make lemonade out of slightly-spoiled lemons by hand-sorting and hand-squeezing each lemon. And that can be effective -- at least it's more efficient than trying to use genetic engineering to construct a lemon out of raw amino acids -- but it's not always fun.<p>There are high-level APIs that are a joy to use. I love jQuery, for example, which is a layer of Javascript atop more Javascript atop an absolutely <i>scary</i> C program atop Unix or Windows and yet somehow manages to feel lightweight and elegant and composeable. But for every elegant API there are dozens of clunky ones.<p>The lovely thing about low-level C or assembly is that the building blocks tend to be simple, understandable, and composeable -- and, if they aren't, it's not so much work to rewrite them. (Though, as jgc points out, in modern times even assembly is hardly immune to complexity. The idiosyncrasies of modern processor architectures are so baroque that it takes years for optimizing compilers to be refined to take advantage of them.)",1249474080

300180,comment,299417,299969,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Valid advice if you've got serious persistent problems with food, like overeating, junk food addictions, etc.  But, if you already have a good diet and have no food-related health issues, then a nutritionist will likely be of limited utility--certainly less than a few hours of research on the Internet (careful research...citations needed).<p>Certainly there are some nutritionists who are on the cutting edge of the field and follow the latest research (and parse it with knowledge that most popular science coverage of food is bullshit), but I've come upon a few who mingled current trends with ""ancient wisdom"" a little too much and end up being purveyors of ""alternative medicine"".  A friend of mine went on a huge soy kick for a year or two, because her nutritionist had bought into the ""soy is a magical cancer preventative"" hype.  We now know with confidence that soy in many forms is actually kinda hard on the body (hormone producing chemicals in food are something that should be treated with caution, and not consumed in large quantities without careful study), and the research that indicated cancer prevention was probably overblown and certainly not specific enough.<p>So, see a nutritionist if you want, but take all advice with a grain of salt.  Nobody knows everything, and moderation is probably the best choice when in doubt.  (Though anyone who tells that you should eat more fruits and vegetables is almost certainly right.  Moderation is probably not a concern with broccoli and carrots and blueberries.)",1221029437

It's easy to try to get in another hour of startup work before bed, but being in any sort of sleep debt will MASSIVELY impact your actual productivity.<p>One thing I always liked doing was finishing up my day job work-day, going to the gym, working out, showering, changing, and walking back into my home office like I'm starting the day over again, this time working on my startup.  The exercise is not only good for you, but can wake you up and help you turn off your day job, and reboot fresh for your startup work.",1221029423

Because a lot of people assume they have to use layers on top of the OS, while modern Unix systems have good file systems and memory managers (maybe have a look at DragonFly BSD; they are going into an interesting direction).",1221028920

300168,comment,300065,300065,0,0,staunch,,,"> <i>You can drown in opportunity. We all have this aversion to finishing work because once you get into it, it gets mundane.</i><p>By far my favorite topic and he only slightly touched it, and not from the perspective of a founder. He's lucky (I think) that he can just drop money on something exciting and check in to see how it grows.<p>The growing part is so damn hard. It seems like it boils down to two options:<p>Do something that:<p>A) Is profitable but definitely not something you'd do for free.<p>B) Is something you'd do for free but much less likely to be profitable.<p>I always struggle with something PG said[1]: ""where there's muck, there's brass.""<p>I wonder if PG was wrong or not. It definitely seems like Viaweb was done purely for the money and that the experience was so excruciating that it almost scarred him. He talks about doing another startup like someone who doesn't want to do another tour in a war zone. Yet he seems to have found something (YCombinator) that may turn out to be more profitable than Viaweb and certainly seems much less painful. Mark Cuban doesn't seem to have found his businesses nearly as painful -- yet they don't seem so much more exciting than online stores.<p>Maybe you only get to do the fun+profitable stuff once you've made it? Or is it just as easy to find something you're deep down passionate about that's also just as likely to be profitable as anything else you can think of?<p>Most of what I think are my best ideas come from needs I see. I need to solve a problem, so I look around to see if I can pay someone who already solved it. On occasion I find that no one seems to have created a product to solve the problem. A lot of the time it's something I could create myself in weeks or months, which isn't very painful because as soon as my need is met my job is done. The painful part comes when I try to turn that solution into a business. Now I'm spending years solving a problem that was barely interesting for weeks.<p>Filling needs you see is probably the most commonly recommended way to start a business. But, is it really the best way considering that you have to expect to spend <i>years</i> in the trenches with it?<p>1. <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html</a>",1221028286

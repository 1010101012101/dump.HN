It's easy to consult a client once, hard to do it over and over.  You're only as good as your last few projects and the best you can do in business is win some favor, loyalty rarely exists. Most of my clients have been with me for 4-10 years.  They do my intros and referrals.<p>Pricing wise, sometimes when I'm asked to do something, I find out how long the task is taking an employee right now.  Other times I come across a waste myself.  Employees are quick to tell you their biggest mundane pains.<p>I estimate how many hours per week/year it takes, estimate their percentage of yearly salary towards, cut it down by 20% and use that as my value estimate on what to base it off.<p>It's realy compelling when you can walk in with a conservative cost of $X,000 a year for a particular task in a department and offer to get rid of it forever for 20-30% of it.  It takes writing up a business case, having managers and employees sign off on it, and the trust and a track record to get it done.  The customers that I've earned the trust of typically just tell me now to make sure I have a business case signed off on file and quit wasting the management's time with approval, and just report what I got done.<p>Screw that up once, and I'm toast.  Keep it right, and it's good for everyone.  Kind of like hiring a Lawyer and Accountant to get the details right.  Would you lose your mind if your lawyer or accountant forgot a detail on your mortgage or accounting?  Probably not.  I just try to remember that's how much I'm being counted on and it definitely can have it's ups and downs.<p>I have worked Small up to medium enterprise (low billions) and nothing makes them happier when you can talk their language -- getting more done with the same staff.<p>My heart, though, is in SMB, there's nothing quite like it.",1325616858

I know of no media or marketing company of any reasonable size that doesn't outsource some part of their marketing to another agency or marketing services company.  Yes, even agencies outsource some of the work to promote themselves... to an agency.<p>Should Google have more oversight into what they are paying for?  Sure, just like everyone who hires a 3rd party to do stuff under their name and aegis.  But just because Google have built the technology to run video ads, do we naturally believe that they also have the creative, marketing ops, and other pieces/talent/staff necessary to build, manage, measure, and improve the campaign?  Perhaps, but from a resource and efficiency POV, they may find it cheaper to just outsource that to an agency and keep fewer resource in-house for marketing vs., say, engineering.<p>It's ok for companies to purchase services from other companies.

3420587,comment,3419840,3420252,0,0,meric,,,"What you're describing sound more like the definition of a CMS than of a framework. With frameworks you no longer have to manage your own sockets/sessions/connections (some servers take care of this also). Instead of you calling on a socket to send data to clients, the framework calls your functions that simply return the data. More elaborate frameworks come with ""helper"" functions that, for example, cleans up input data for preparation of saving to the database, (preventing SQL injections), abstracts away the database models. i.e write only one set of models in python, so you don't have to rewrite your database tables when you switch from MSSQL to PGSQL. Each framework come with their own set of design patterns. While this might reduce the flexibility in terms of the architecture design, a framework has been tested and used many times, so the patterns a framework comes with are usually quite suited for what the framework is designed for. e.g. with Django web framework, you (must) use an MVC architecture. Although it is quite difficult to diverge from the MVC pattern, the MVC pattern is a suitable choice for web applications.<p>Frameworks abstracts away the bare metal of the HTTP protocol, the database, and allows you to concentrate only on the content and logic. A framework is basically a semi-built application; Look at your past websites, what are the common things between all of them? If you abstract all of that into a 'library', you might have some sort of framework there.<p>Of course with PHP, a lot of that is already taken care of. One thing I remember from PHP was that you write your code in a .php file, and the name of the file becomes part of the URL the user must type into the browser. Well, a framework can abstract away that too, so you can write your own urls and redirect to the appropriate function/file to handle the 'visit'.<p><i>I might have overstated what a framework can do here, I rarely go without it so perhaps maybe running with only a server can still provide some of the above described functionality, especially with regards to connections and sockets.</i>",1325613982

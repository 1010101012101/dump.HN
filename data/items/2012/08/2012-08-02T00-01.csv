I read the entire thing.<p>I'm sure that my thought process while developing code is ugly and messy and scattered too. However, this level of TDD just strikes me as a mechanism to generate legacy code to maintain. It's as if, upon embarking on a new project, these people so miss their giant codebases, with slow builds, and spaghetti grep results, that they have concocted a way to maximize the rate of legacy code generation, so they can feel at home again. The result is that you do a lot of what <i>feels</i> like work. You're constantly moving code around, changing names, tweaking stuff. You tell yourself that you're ""Refactoring"" and that's how it's supposed to work.",1343869152

You could not have had a successful commercial Internet built on infrastructure as thoroughly owned up as the early '90s telco networks were.<p>I am also not talking about ""the BBS scene"" (which I was very much a part of). The BBS scene didn't own up switches. The BBS scene didn't have lists of X.25 outdials. The BBS scene couldn't rig you up a conference bridge. Lots of people posted comments on BBSs. Very few of them would know what to do with a DMS-100.<p>I am not saying the people to whom I am alluding were evil. They were not. I'm saying they were much smarter than ""the BBS scene"" as a whole, and that the pranks they were playing got <i>way</i> out of hand.<p>Also: I don't know why you're talking down early Phrack issues.

Though the later association with guys wearing earpieces and black sunglasses taking a bullet for the President didn't help, either.<p>I don't <i>valorize</i> the '80s BBS scene per se, I just think the response was a bit over the top. Instead of fixing their shit, they tried to paint a bunch of teenage pranksters as some kind of apocalypse, as if these were uniquely evil geniuses, and raiding some BBSs and board game companies to incapacitate them was the real fix to the problem. If you're so wide-open that critical infrastructure is being owned by teenage kids of the level of technical sophistication that you find in '80s <i>Phrack</i> issues, there might be a bigger problem. If anything, the companies were lucky it was teenage kids and not, at that time, anyone more nefarious.<p>As far as the ""mythos"" part, the writings are what's appealing to me, mainly; there's a certain breathless, naive technical wonder of discovery that runs throughout the '80s textfiles on the subject, which is somehow endearing.",1343868704

I think that societies are constantly adapting and people are much the same as they always have been.  We are living in a nice time where complexity of our society allows for good sanitation, delivery of food from half-way around the world to off-set local production problems and seasonal shortages, and modern medicine is paid for by the fossil fuels which are causing global warming.<p>So I guess I am probably as cynical as they get.<p>The thing though is that within the article there is a great deal of honest discourse, but you can't put all the supporting data into it in that format.  The fact is that we have a society where all the rhetoric about rule of law and a government of laws aside, the people expect the government to prosecute people they have been told are ""bad guys"" and so you get:[1]<p>1)  Lori Drew prosecuted for hacking and by hacking I mean violating the terms of service of a web site.  Her conviction was later set aside on vagueness grounds.<p>2)  Jeff Skilling prosecuted for honest services fraud under a standard that would make viewing HN from work a federal felony.  His conviction for honest services fraud was set aside by the Supreme Court on vagueness grounds.<p>3)  Daniel Hurwitz prosecuted because he knew or should have known that there was a statistical likelihood that at least some of his pain patients were selling narcotics from their prescriptions on the street.  Hurwitz was following general medical consensus regarding medically appropriate prescriptions for chronic pain as well as the DEA's guidance.  He was convicted, won a right to a new trial, and was convicted a second time for a smaller number of charges.<p>4)  You also see federal entrapment of Randy Weaver for firearms violations (it is undisputed that Weaver would not have violated the law but for the repeated and prolonged insistence of a government informant paid to get convictions).  Weaver may not be a good guy but neither is Skilling.  This sort of thing, as well as additional problems with the case going forward (bad advice from lawyers, incorrect statements by a judge, etc) set up the tragedy at Ruby Ridge and FBI conduct so egregious that a man who shot and killed an FBI agent won a significant settlement from the government.[2]<p>These patterns have been building since Reagan was in office.[3]<p>The real problem here is breaking through the social consensus that we could never do what China does despite the fact that our civil liberties are degrading and the basic infrastructure is in place for those exact sorts of abuses.  Indeed the only real difference is in degree, not in kind.<p>I am reminded of Karl Doenitz's thoughts on the lessons from Nazi Germany.  Doenitz, the architect of the U-boat war, was the one who lead the Third Reich from Hitler's suicide to the surrender.  He said that the primary lesson one should draw from Nazi Germany was on the importance of a robust tradition of civil liberties.[4]  (The fact that this is a systemic argument I think avoids Godwin's Law and puts this simply in the domain of history discussion.)  The upshot is really that the problem that lead to the rise of the Nazis was not caused by bad people as we are lead to believe but rather by systemic deficiencies in German government before their rise to power.  It's worth noting also that at the outset of WWI, the Kaiser Wilhelm stated that no civilized nation does not carefully rein in their press (responding to Serbian statements that freedom of the press prevented them from telling the press not to celebrate Archduke Ferdinand's death).<p>[1]  see ""Three Felonies a Day:  How Feds Target the Innocent"" by EFF/ACLU veteran Harvey Silverglate.  He covers the Hurwitz and Skilling cases, though the book was published before the Supreme Court ruled on the honest services fraud statute.<p>[2]  See ""No More Wacos"" by Kopel and Blackman.<p>[3]  Ibid.  The authors blame Waco and Ruby Ridge largely on the militarization of law enforcement under Reagan and Clinton, and the drug exception to Posse Comitatus under Reagan.<p>[4]  See ""Ten Years and Twenty Days"" by Karl Doenitz.",1343868196

A lot of people thought that because she did something bad, that we should find something to charge her with, so the US attorney in California charged her with unauthorized access to MySpace's computer systems for the ""crime"" of violating their terms of service.  After she was convicted of misdemeanor and acquitted of felony charges, the judge held the law was too vague as applied and threw out the convictions.<p>Exhibit B:  The Daniel Hurwitz prosecution.  Here was a doctor following exactly what the DEA's public guidance was, who was prosecuted and eventually convicted on the basis that he had some knowledge of the <i>statistical certainty</i> that some of his patients were selling narcotics on the street from his prescriptions.  And indeed when the defence noted that they had the DEA's public guidance to submit into evidence the DEA's response was to remove it from their web site.<p>The fact is that total surveillance + vague laws is <i>exactly</i> what the USSR used to lock people up and exactly what China uses to lock people up.

However, when different formats use different offsets to identify themselves, it is possible to construct the file in such a way that it validly identifies as more than one format.",1343865708

In the technology sector, the link is here:<p><a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/technology/successful?ref=more"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/technology/su...</a><p>Scroll down until you get to projects a year older or more, then take a look at the comments and updates of those projects. You'll find that few have delivered yet and a lot of them failed outright. Some that have delivered have quality issues (what did you expect) and a few have actually delivered. My advice is don't kickstart a project if you think you are actually purchasing a product. You're funding someone who promises that they will deliver you a product if they are successfully able to make it at or below their initial estimate. If they underestimated, don't expect a refund. Nobody gets a refund from kickstarter.",1343865612
